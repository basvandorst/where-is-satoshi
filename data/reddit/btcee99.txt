Nice article, but surely this part is mistaken?


I thought that the software enforces that txs in the mempool are always valid to be included in the next block; when a new block arrives it has to remove any conflicting txs in the mempool.  Is that not correct?
@_date: 2016-04-26 16:36:46
I'm not that familiar with the code base, but isn't [this]( the part where the conflicts get removed?

You pay the same fee rate (bitcoin per byte) but the segwit transaction will be smaller in size (virtual byte size to be precise), so you'll end up paying less bitcoin per transaction.
@_date: 2015-12-11 16:34:28
The fee is actually not that low - normally it would not take so long.  But in the past 12 hours the queue has been building up because transaction rate is so high: [graph](
The fee rate of your transaction is 5486 satoshis / kB, but if you look at [the queue]( there's about 8 MB of transactions with a fee rate higher than yours. 
This means it could take a long while more before it gets confirmed. You can try to double spend your transaction with a higher fee if you can't wait.
@_date: 2015-12-19 12:06:48
Yeah this is probably a dust issue.  Wallets are implementing dynamic fees, but they probably need to implement dynamic dust limits as well, based on the fee they are paying...
@_date: 2015-12-13 02:34:20
The argument seems to be that many of these transactions are not legitimate and should not be on the blockchain. Thus there isn't a problem because as the wait times for low-fee transactions goes up, they'll either pay higher fees (and get their fast confirmation times), or stop sending them altogether.
What would be interesting is if we see the fees paid rise substantially, but transaction volumes remain high.  That would signal that "true demand" exceeds the capacity of the network.
In the end I guess it depends on your view of what is an acceptable fee to send a transaction. Some would like to keep it at current levels (by raising the blocksize), while others would like to see them increase (to reflect the costs to decentralization).

* &gt;= minrelaytxfee: tx enters mempool and is relayed, no problem.
* &lt; minrelaytxfee, and coin-age priority &gt;= bitcoin core's "high priority" threshold of 57.6e6: tx is allowed into mempool and relayed, subject to rate limiter (default 15 kB / minute, set with limitfreerelay=&lt;x&gt;)
* otherwise: transaction is rejected (by default; I think you can change this by setting relaypriority=0)
This is as of 0.11.2; 0.12 will have the mempool limiter so I'm not sure how that's going to change things.
@_date: 2015-12-07 05:56:31
Well the reason for the error is clear - most nodes already know of the original transaction, so this one appears as a double spend.
The fee on the original is low, but unfortunately the priority (coin age) is also quite high.  This means that it could have propagated quite well in the network, and is therefore hard to replace.
I don't have a solution, sorry, except to wait.  Maybe someone else has a better solution.
edit: the double spend was successful.

Thanks for the info. Those input amounts are actually pretty small, though.. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 01:26:36
Aging one day is only (on average) for 1 bitcoin.
If you are sending 0.02 bitcoin, for e.g., then you need to age 50 days, because priority is proportional to the input amounts.
@_date: 2015-06-10 02:28:15
No, it is not "complicated", you just need to read the code.
Please [stop saying]( factually wrong things such as "priority block size is a consensus rule" - that is not true at all.
The default priority block size is 50 kB (not sure where you get 0.5 MB from), but miners are free to change it as they like, for convenience it's even a [command line option](

From my sims it's also ~ 3.5 years - [sim code](
The key points are like you mentioned - all possible time windows (that start and end on a block) must be considered, and the event occurrences must be independent, so no overlapping allowed.

The tx fee is high enough. The problem is that the first output (0.00001 BTC to address 13bnz...) is too small, thus triggering the dust (anti-spam) protections in Bitcoin Core for certain nodes.
If you want to double-spend it successfully, you cannot have such a small output amount.  It should be at least 0.00002730 BTC (which corresponds to the default minrelaytxfee of 0.00005 BTC / kB), but to be on the safe side it should be at least 0.00005460 BTC.
This is a wallet issue; the wallet should not permit you to make such a transaction.  I've raised the issue with the developers [here](
@_date: 2015-06-30 18:15:44
If you look at the fees being paid by the spammed transactions, the majority are higher than OPs.  So in theory it does have something to do with the stress test, even though we can't be sure about this specific transaction.
Regarding transaction propagation, it looks OK, I'm not sure if you're basing that solely on blockchain.info's chart. It's in my mempool, and has a 99.17% confidence factor on [BlockCypher]( (which is based on measuring propagation).
@_date: 2015-06-22 12:32:33
Transactions are generally cleared according to their fee rate (fee per kB), so as a gauge of whether a transaction will be included in the next block, you have to look at the (reverse) cumulative mempool size: the total size of all transactions with fee rate greater than that of the tx in question, and compare it to the average max block size of 750 to 1000 kB.
The blockchain spamming appears to have started already - [here]( is the (static) graph as of now. The spammed transactions appear to have fee rate of ~ 45,000 satoshis/kB, so you have to pay higher than this to get confirmed quickly.
EDIT 1: [Current snapshot]( at 13:52 UTC, the transaction arrival byte rate is ~ 1.3 MB per ten minutes (and increasing). This is greater than the network can bear (0.75 - 1.0 MB per ten minutes), so the mempool will begin to accumulate - it's currently ~ 12 MB.  Currently the fee needed to go into the next block is about 54,000 satoshis/kB.

Core 0.10 fee estimation is known to overestimate the required fee.

@_date: 2015-06-22 14:25:37
I should have been more specific: it depends on the input value (# of BTC) as well.  If the transactions consumed smallish outputs (say &lt; 0.001 BTC) then it's unlikely that it had high "coin age priority", even if the outputs were 7 days old.
@_date: 2015-06-04 03:48:26


That's exactly right. OP should contact the app creator to ask for help / to do a bug report.
If the app creator doesn't know what dust is, you should avoid the wallet. Breadwallet is most reliable on iOS at this point.

This scatter plot shows the mempool state during the stress test of 29 May 2015. 
Each point corresponds to a transaction in the mempool, at the time just before a block was found.
The y-coordinate is the transaction fee rate (fee per 1000 bytes), while the x-coordinate is the respective block height. 
Blue points are transactions which were included in their respective blocks, while red points are those which were not included.
This demonstrates the typical transaction selection policies of miners, which is to select transactions greedily by fee rate until their max block size is reached (or until hitting the minimum allowable fee rate).
NOTE - this plot only includes transactions that are of low priority (coin age), and those that did not depend on other mempool transactions.
@_date: 2015-06-23 02:42:07
Say there's only a single miner, and his (soft limit) max block size is 750 kB.  Say also that difficulty is at equilibrium, so the average block rate is 1 per ten minutes.
Then the (simple) capacity byterate is 
    maxblocksize*blockrate = 750 kB / decaminute
However, miners also enforce a min fee rate. Transactions below this fee rate are not eligible for feerate-based inclusion (they must rely on coinage priority). 
In our present model, we don't model coin age (since their effects are not very significant currently). So, if our single miner is using a min fee rate of 1000 satoshis per kB, for example, our capacity byterate is now a function of feerate:
    capacity = (750 kB / decaminute) if feerate &gt;= 1000, else 0
So this is a step function.  To get the actual graph you see, we [estimate]( the hashrates and min fee rates of all mining pools, and sum up their individual step functions.
@_date: 2015-06-10 03:22:47


I'm relieved to hear you say that, for a while I was starting to think you were just trolling.
As [says]( it's not possible for there to be consensus rules on what transactions get into blocks, because that would depend on mempools being synchronized, which is not the case with bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-13 09:36:20
Thanks. I'm not sure what you mean by this though:


@_date: 2015-12-12 00:16:52
It's from my own analyses, running the fee estimation [software](
@_date: 2015-06-30 17:42:51
The fee rate (satoshis / kB) of your transaction is 10,007. Normally this is enough to get confirmed quickly but there's been a spike in transactions, requiring a higher fee rate.
You can see the effect [here](
Also you can see the mempool backlog according to fee rate [here]( Miners typically give priority according to fee rate.  As of this moment, there is about 12 MB worth of transactions with a fee rate greater than yours.  That would take at least 12 blocks, or ~ 2 hours to clear.  
But that's only if there were no more incoming transactions.  Looking at the previous graph, new transactions with a fee rate of &gt; 10,007 are currently arriving at a rate of about 890 kB per ten minutes.  That is very close to the capacity of the network, which is somewhere in the range of 750-1000 kB per ten minutes.
In short, it could be a while more before your transaction gets confirmed.
@_date: 2015-06-17 11:17:13


This was maybe true at the time it was written, but not today.
Your transaction is indeed above the 57.6e6 threshold, but it still has to compete with other transactions for the priority block space.
The default priority block space in Bitcoin Core is [50 kB]( This means that by default, only 50 kB of space per block (compared to the max block size of 750-1000 kB) is set aside for priority transactions.  Some pools even set the size to zero (last I checked a few months ago, F2Pool, the biggest mining pool, does this). 
So your transaction, in addition to being over the 57.6e6 threshold, must be in the top 50 kB of transactions or so, by priority, for it to be included in a block. How soon this happens would depend on the priorities of other transaction arrivals. It's not very predictable, so most people will just include a fee.
That said, your transaction should get confirmed eventually.

Relevant: [ascribe.io]( making use of bitcoin blockchain to track title to digital assets.
@_date: 2015-12-07 04:46:02
Just to be clear, we're talking about the signed transaction that you're attempting to submit to the bitcoin network through various "pushtx" sites.
The act of submitting to "pushtx" is in fact publishing it publically to the bitcoin network.  For example, your original signed transaction can be seen [here](  So posting it here doesn't really change anything.  But it's up to you.
@_date: 2015-06-11 01:53:13
It's the fee per unit transaction size ("fee rate") that's relevant.
For example, your transaction is 226 bytes long according to blockchain.info. The fee paid is 0.00003, or 3000 satoshis. The fee rate, therefore is
    3000 * 1000 / 226 = 13274 satoshis per kB
The default minimum required fee rate is currently 1000 satoshis per kB. Given the average tx size of 0.6 kB and the current exchange rate, this is about $0.0014 per transaction.
When transaction arrivals are low, the min fee rate will be sufficient to get in the next block majority of the time, but during periods of high traffic, it will lose out to higher fee rate transactions and might get delayed by a few blocks.
There's another mechanism for getting into blocks without paying a fee - that's by coin age, but it's rather unpredictable.
@_date: 2015-06-22 13:48:45
They said their transactions are going to be 3 kB each, though.  In comparison, the average transaction size is ~ 5 times smaller, at 600 bytes.
In the end it's not about txs per second but bytes per second. Currently it's about 1.3 MB per 10 minutes, compared with their [stated target]( of 2 MB per 10 minutes.
This is still larger than what the network can bear, though, which is about 0.75 - 1 MB per ten minutes (the max block size).
@_date: 2015-06-10 02:29:38


This is utterly false.
@_date: 2015-12-12 12:51:23
The double spend is referring to [this transaction]( You can see that the tx ID is different, yet all the addresses and amounts are he same. No matter which transaction goes through, it doesn't change anything, so don't worry.  It's likely due to someone trying to be a nuisance on the network.
What is not so good, however, is that your wallet provider (foxbit?) is not very clear about how to choose the right tx fee. What works in the past may not work at the present because transaction rates might increase, etc.  So you should complain to them for not choosing a high enough fee.
@_date: 2015-12-12 12:30:10


the blockchain.info "priority" score is actually quite meaningless.  To know for sure about your transaction you would have to post the transaction ID so others can take a look at it, but the likely cause is that the fee is low, giving it a low priority in the queue.
At the moment, there is a rather large transaction backlog due to high transaction rates. But your wallet provider has the responsibility to recommend you a high enough fee to get confirmed quickly. You can try checking with them.
@_date: 2015-06-10 06:46:41


It's 10 bits per 1000 bytes. OP's transaction is 226 bytes, which gives it a fee rate of 10 bits exactly.
@_date: 2015-06-11 10:10:04
Nice background. 


Practically all of the zero transactions blocks are produced &lt; 1 min after the previous block. However there are often leftover transactions in the mempool. 
It seems that a disproportionately large amount of them are produced by F2Pool and AntPool, and from [this post]( on the dev mailing list by a F2Pool representative, it seems like their strategy is to mine only on the previous block headers until they have verified the full block, to minimize their orphan rate. If that is the case, then that would explain 0-transaction blocks - if they are mining on headers only, they won't know which transactions are valid, and thus the only option is to produce an empty block.
This is only a theory though - someone more familiar with the mining scene might be able to give a better explanation.
@_date: 2015-06-12 12:46:58
I haven't looked at it in much detail, but my guess is that 100 kB is the [blockminsize]( policy parameter, the default of which is zero.  
This is because those 100 kB blocks often include very low fee transactions, which won't normally be included.
@_date: 2015-06-13 12:38:03


Not really. Min block size relates specifically to how miners treat zero fee transactions. Once above the min block size, miners will ignore zero fee transactions, but will include them if they are below it.
The frequent 100 kB blocks shows that there is often a backlog of zero fee transactions. F2Pool also sometimes produces blocks below 100 kB, signifying (according to the Core code) that the mempool is empty at that point.
@_date: 2015-06-27 03:17:22
Why [a 1 kB floor]( for tx size though?  The reference miner doesn't do this when calculating fee rate.
@_date: 2015-06-01 12:45:49
I'm not sure exactly which gaps you're referring to (the most prominent one I see is at ~7000 feerate), but these are the actual transactions in the mempool, so if there's a gap it's because people are simply not sending as many transactions within that range of feerates.
@_date: 2015-06-22 14:11:27
What was the coin age of your transactions?
If they have high coin age, they could have got into the "block priority size" portion, bypassing the fee rankings altogether.
@_date: 2015-06-12 01:25:10
Great, thanks. I see the "empty-block-first" mining strategy is already well-known.
@_date: 2015-06-12 15:09:17
I think there's some confusion about the meaning of "soft cap". As used by it refers to the soft forking constraint on max block size, not the pool policy of max block size which is indeed, as you have said, an "irrelevant parameter".
Now, I am not sure how familiar you are with the soft fork concept, which was used for example to roll out P2SH.
@_date: 2015-06-12 15:45:00
I'm still a bit hazy on why the term "soft-fork" is being used here though. The lifting of the 1 MB rule is done simultaneously with the new, upgradeable 2 MB rule, so where's the soft fork?  It's not like miners are using different validation code. All nodes will have to upgrade, and therefore they will also have the same "upgradeable max block size" validation logic.   
@_date: 2015-12-11 17:22:30
The mempool size graph shows fee paying transactions: those with fee &gt;= the default minrelaytxfee (5000 sats/kB). Normally these transactions get totally cleared, pretty often.
There doesn't seem to be any malicious activity going on; transaction rates (in bytes per unit time) is high and close to capacity.
Also it seems that F2Pool (~25% of hashrate) increased their min fee rate from &lt; 5000 sats/kB to 20,000, roughly 24 hours ago.
You should probably use a fee rate &gt; 20,000 to be on the safe side.
 for the graphs.

The cointape results have seemed a bit off to me for several months now, do you know if it's still being maintained?
For example currently it shows ~ 9000 unconfirmed transactions with fee rate in the range 40,000-50,000 sat/kB. But it also showed a similar figure 8 hours ago.  And the number is much too large; e.g. comparing to [another source](
@_date: 2015-06-12 01:12:15


It's because, presumably, once they're done verifying the previous block, they switch to mining a block that now includes the valid transactions.
Therefore only blocks produced in a small window after the previous block contain 0 transactions.
It's not that some pools are always mining 0 transaction blocks, and magically they always find them quickly - that would be, as you have noted - nonsensical behavior.

Electrum is bitcoin wallet software. A bitcoin wallet is one that provides a user interface to the Bitcoin network, such as displaying your balance, managing private keys, constructing transactions to allow you to spend, etc.
What you have is a paper wallet. But to spend funds you still need to import the key into some wallet software which will allow you to create and broadcast a transaction. So a paper wallet simply provides the key storage function of a bitcoin wallet, in a more secure way.
The Electrum seed is equivalent to your paper wallet key, in the sense that, the seed is all you need to recover the wallet, and all the funds that have been received to addresses in that wallet. The Electrum wallet is a 'deterministic' wallet, in the sense that all receiving addresses in the wallet can be derived deterministically from the seed.


Yes, but the idea is to make sure that the seed / key, whether in Electrum or a paper wallet, is not generated on a machine that is connected to the Internet. You can actually do that with Electrum in offline mode, but most people use it as a 'hot' wallet for day-to-day spending.

That is indeed the equation, however what you've said is not true because priority has to meet a minimum threshold of [57,600,000]( If the threshold is not met, the tx won't even be relayed (in Core 0.10), if it doesn't have a fee.
That's where the 1-day age figure comes from - and it refers to a 1 BTC transaction. If you are sending less than 1 BTC, then the time needed to reach the threshold is inversely proportional to the amount sent.
In practice, the time needed is somewhat less than 1 day (for 1 BTC), due to the fact that the size used in the equation is a modified tx size (which discounts inputs).

Thanks for referring me to the paper. There's something that's not quite clear to me though - it says your goal is so that 'time locked transactions are provided even before funds are locked in a 2-of-2'. I understand that if malleability is taken care of then the nLockTime tx is guaranteed to be good the moment I receive it. But as a recipient of funds I need a guarantee that I will in fact eventually receive the nLockTime tx, in the window between just before the sender signs the tx, and the moment where I actually do receive the nLockTime tx. If not there might be the case in which the sender pushes the tx, GreenAddress discovers that it is unable to provide the nLockTime tx for whatever reason, and then there is a race to try to doublespend the original tx so that the funds don't get unrecoverably locked in the 2-of-2.

Of course the 100 kb block will propagate faster. The issue is whether the increased propagation speed is cost-effective with respect to the additional transaction fees forsaken. That's what the analysis in the link I posted is about. 
From the [link](


So they model the additional probability of being orphaned because of larger block size, and put a monetary cost on being orphaned based on the current block reward of 25 bitcoins. Then they compute what the minimum tx fee would have to be to account for this orphan cost.
If the 100 gb block only takes nanoseconds longer to propagate than the 100 kb, then the probability of being orphaned is not much more than if you had produced a 100 kb block, but you gain a lot more transaction fees. The way to calculate the tradeoff precisely is to model the orphan cost properly, as what was attempted in the link.
It's not a race with you having 100 gb blocks and others having 100 kb blocks, because blocks are randomly discovered within the 10 min time period and not all at once. If blocks were produced at definite intervals all at once then your analysis would be correct. But others' block size makes no difference at all. What matters is to determine the ideal number of transactions to include based on the tx fees and the network model. And the model predicts that as throughput increases, the min tx fee at which a transaction should be included in a block goes down.
Feel free to PM me if you want to take this further.

As far as I know you can't do this with Bitcoin Core at the moment.
Some companies have released open-source software that do this, however - Bitpay has [Insight]( which talks to bitcoind over rpc to build the address database, whereas Coinbase released [Toshi]( which is an alternate full-node implementation.
That's the two I'm aware of.
@_date: 2014-06-23 14:52:28
Well in fact in my original reply I noted that the min tx fee (0.1 millibitcoins) is too low to compensate for the estimated orphan cost of 0.8 millibitcoins. So you are right that pools today are not compensated enough by the transaction fees to justify the additional probability of being orphaned. 
But you said that increases in network speed in the future doesn't matter because the smaller block will always have faster propagation. But it does matter because with sufficiently high network speed the marginal orphan cost can be chased to arbitrarily low values. That means as network speed increases, it is reasonable to expect pools to admit more (fee-paying) transactions, which you did not agree with.
I appreciate your comments on this topic.

Implement [smart oracles]( and build out a proper p2p derivatives market. Any of the large bitcoin companies are in a good position to leverage the trust that the community has in them, to do this. 
The end goal would be for users to be able to hold a on-blockchain 'synthetic' USD, for example, in the form of a [smart derivatives contract]( mediated by an oracle, allowing people to transact and take advantage of the decentralized bitcoin network, while not being exposed to price risk.
Solutions such as Bitreserve/Coinapult Locks are beginning to address this to some degree but these are centralized solutions with significant counterparty / regulatory risk.
I also hope the large bitcoin companies will develop more decentralized solutions to off-chain/instant payments (although I'm sure they're looking at it already). Coinbase off-chain payments are nice but this requires one to have an account with them. The [tech exists]( to do this in a trustless way, however, and I'm looking forward to seeing developments in this area.

The way to solve this is to use an intermediate multisig non-timelocked tx. If A wants to send timelocked bitcoins to B, he cannot simply create a tx spending his own output, because as you point out, B has no assurance that A will not double-spend this output before the lock time has been reached.  
So what needs to be done is, A will send his bitcoins with no time-lock to a 2-of-2 multsig address requiring key(A)+key(B). Once this tx (call it tx1) has been confirmed, he will create the timelocked tx, tx2, which spends from the output of tx1, and provide his half of the signature and then pass it to B. There is no way for A to double spend these funds because it requires both a signature from A and from B.
@_date: 2014-12-11 01:29:04
Happy to answer.
1) Yes this is at the crux of the methodology known as 'hypothesis testing', and what you've described is, in the field of statistics, known as 'Type I error' (Type II is the converse - classifying the die as fair when it is in fact unfair).
The way this is typically handled, is to restrict the probability of Type I error to a level you're comfortable with. For example, typical values are 1% or 5% - you might have heard the phrase 'significance level of 99%'; this is what it's referring to.
Once you've chosen the significance level, you can choose a certain critical value that, if the test statistic were to exceed, you would reject the null hypothesis - that is, in this case, reject the hypothesis that the die is fair.
So, we have what is known as a p-value from our chi square test. The statistics of the the p-value tell us that, if this was a truly fair die, the probability of getting a p-value as extreme as the one we observed is on the order of 3.7e-16, or in other words, if we were to choose a critical value for this test that corresponds to this p-value, the probability of Type I error would only be 3.7e-16. So the probability of incorrectly rejecting a fair die is extremely small.
2) The formula for calculating entropy is the same whether the die is fair or not - it's 
    H = -sum(p_i * log[p_i] for i in {0,1,2,...,f}) 
and p_i is the probability of rolling number i.
This definition comes from information theory, and in the case of private key generation, is related to the number of possible keys that the attacker will have to test in a brute force attack.
To illustrate point 1) more clearly, see [this graph]( for the sampling distribution of the chi-square statistic under the assumption of a fair die (obtained through simulation). The vertical green line, on the other hand, is the statistic obtained from your data - by any measure, one can see that it is pretty much safe to reject the hypothesis of a fair die.

I don't know how to best solve this, it is beyond my level of expertise. But in theory it could work with BIP70-type payments in which sender and recipient are both online at the same moment. 
It sounds like your team does not consider this a substantial weakness. To me it is not such a big deal for a day-to-day personal hot wallet, but if I am a company receiving huge sums on occasion I would be wary to rely on this model.

The sample size is actually big enough.
Performing a chi-square test for uniform distribution in python:
    from scipy.stats import chisquare
    counts = [120, 130, 90, 75, 110, 160, 170, 170, 140, 140, 140, 120, 85, 105, 140, 90]
    stat,pval = chisquare(counts)
gives a p-value of `3.7e-16`, which means that if it was truly uniform, the probability of the distribution being more uneven than this is 3.7e-16. In other words this die is pretty damn far way from being a fair die.
Edit: bonus statistic (and to keep this on-topic) - if the die was fair it would give 4 bits of entropy per roll, so for e.g. to derive a private key with 128 bits of entropy, you would roll 32 times.
Assuming the die was not fair, but instead had a distribution given by Chuck's graph, it would have an entropy of 3.96 bits per roll. So instead of 128 bits of entropy after 32 rolls, you would get 126.7, which is close.

FYI you're not supposed to choose the words yourself, because they're supposed to be truly random. (For e.g. if you're really going to choose the 12 longest words, an attacker can sort the dictionary words according to word length and brute force your phrase more easily)
That's why wallets generally generate the seed phrase for you.
In addition, to hold bitcoin at this stage of the game you need to have some basic understanding of computer security. For example, if your 'old crappy computer' is compromised by malware, they can easily steal your funds. There's been many examples of such theft over the years.

In Gavin's gist it says the block solver must send, in addition to the block header and IBLT, also the size of tx data and size of the high-priority tx space. Assuming the solver follows the standard transaction selection policy of highest-priority-first then by fee-by-kilobyte, then this is sufficient information to recover the tx set, and is equivalent to a min-fee policy for inclusion.
The downside is that it seems the miner is limited to these parameters in deciding their selection policy.
The time-based selection policy is not discussed in the article but it seems like an important open question.


If you don't have canonical ordering, the solver would then have to transmit the order separately in order for recipients to reconstruct the full block data. Canonical ordering simply eliminates this overhead.

I understand the malleability issue. The issue you describe is for change addresses when I'm sending bitcoin from my GreenAddress wallet. Before I broadcast the tx, I will create the time-locked refund transaction which GreenAddress will sign and return to me. If there is no malleability, then the funding tx id is unique and the time-locked tx is guaranteed to be good. However because of malleability, the funding tx id might be changed, invalidating the time-locked transaction. That is why you are working to fix malleability.
My question is not concerning this scenario, but the one in which I am receiving bitcoins from someone else. Currently, even with no tx malleability, I cannot guarantee being able to retrieve the funds that I receive. Let's assume there is no tx malleability. I want to receive bitcoins from Bitstamp, so I provide them my GreenAddress address &lt;3......&gt;. They create the tx and push it onto the network. GreenAddress then detects an incoming tx, creates and signs the time-locked tx and emails it to me. But GreenAddress is not able to provide the timelocked tx in advance, in the same way you could for the change address. So there is a period of time between requesting payment from Bitstamp, and finally receiving the timelock tx in my email, in which I am unsure as to GreenAddress's ability to sign the timelocked tx.
The way it should work in my mind, is that through payment protocol, sender sends me the signed funding tx, and GreenAddress signs the timelocked tx, before the funding tx is broadcast. If GreenAddress is not able to supply the signature on the timelocked tx, then I have to contact the sender, and ask him to send me a new tx because the old one is invalid. But that becomes very messy because from the sender's point of view, he has signed away his bitcoins - for him to be safe he needs to make sure he properly double spends the original funding tx that he gave to me.
I hope my point is clear now - regardless, thanks for your responses!

They have [stated]( that conversion between bitcoin and USD is done through Bitstamp, also that they are full reserve, so the $10 in your account exists on their balance sheet for real and is subject to audit. 
As for not being able to withdraw USD, you're right it's not a true market, but a derivatives platform, so as long as they are upfront about the exchange they use and the conditions the exchange must satisfy (such as unimpeded funding/withdrawal of accounts) I don't really see a problem. It is a very common model today; for example, CFD providers allow one to gain exposure to an asset, without having to directly purchase the asset.

No you got it right it's BIP 32, HD wallets, not BIP 38. BIP 38 is a way to encrypt a private key. BIP 32 is a deterministic wallet scheme which GreenAddress uses, and the wallet can be recovered from the mnemonic that they gave you at the start.
It's not inherently more secure than a brainwallet - brainwallets are only insecure if you do not choose a phrase with sufficient entropy, or randomness (which can happen easily, that's why people discourage using it).
That's why in GreenAddress case, they generate the mnemonic phrase for you, and it's rather long - so it's guaranteed to have sufficient entropy, and thus not brute-forceable.

I'm not sure I follow. 'A' is a party who wants to send coins to 'B', but with the condition that 'B' is not able to spend the coins before lock time is reached, and that A is not able to change his mind and rescind his transaction to B. Through the scheme described above this can be done without need for trust in a third party. In OP's use case it sounds like OP is 'A' who wants to donate bitcoins to certain beneficiaries, but to only allow them to redeem them after a certain date. These beneficiaries would then be party 'B'. 
I'm not sure what role is OP playing in your scenario, when you say 'just until it's been created and given to the OP'.
Anyway realized that you're behind Reality Keys, I think it's a great idea and hope it continues to develop so good luck with that.

Put it this way - potential investment gains can only come from one bearing a degree of risk in excess of the norm. In this case, if you choose to deposit your BTC with a third party like Gox, the risk is that they default on their obligations. If you choose to store them yourself, the risk is they get stolen from under your nose. For those with the technical know-how, however, it is possible to store them yourself relatively risk-free, and that is what most long-term BTC holders are doing.
Your bank deposits are insured today, which is why you can get them back - however in the past bank runs, fraud and other crises were common until institutions were created to address these, and if Bitcoin is to succeed in the long-run, such institutions will have to play a role as well. Already there are upcoming Bitcoin vaults that are insured, for e.g. [Elliptic Vault]( But by the time security and other kinks have been worked out, the potential investment upside will have been lost already.

There's no such thing as number of 'Required Confirmations'.  No matter how many confirmations a transaction has, there's always non-zero probability of reversal by an attacker with non-zero hashpower. This probability, however, decreases exponentially with the number of confirmations (for an attacker with &lt; 50% of network hashpower).
It's up to the individual to decide how many confirmations is appropriate for his situation. 6 confirmations is just a rule of thumb.

You are right to say that there is a possibility 'the whole thing could be rewritten' but in my mind the probability of the community accepting a forking change which renders earlier signed transactions to be invalid is on par with the probability of the entire bitcoin system collapsing, which depending on your viewpoint could be considered either 'high' or 'low'.

Yes this should be the way it's done, in a synchronous manner. But the way GreenAddress currently works is that they only send you the nLockTime tx after they detect the tx on the blockchain. How would I go about doing what you described? Furthermore, it's not me who is sending the funds to the 2-of-2, it's a third party. This would need to be automated in a payment protocol.
In any case, this is a totally different issue than the malleability one to which BitFast is referring to - Bitfast I'm afraid you misunderstand.
Edit: After thinking it through a bit I think I understand better now. For a third party I would have to do it synchronously over a BIP70 payment request. Get the nLockTime tx from GreenAddress, then send the third party the request to be signed. Thanks for helping me understand.

I suppose you could have a 2-of-3 NashX contract. The role of the third party would not be to make a decision on whether the contract was fulfilled, as in normal multi-sig escrow, but instead to automatically refund the collateral to both parties after a certain time has reached.
Before the auto-refund time has been reached, either party can submit a request to destroy the collateral, or to extend the auto-refund time.
In this way the NashX property is kept, while at the same time providing protection against key losses from either side. But then you have to trust that the third party does not collude with your counterparty.

The transaction that refunds 1 BTC to the seller is the same transaction that refunds 1 BTC to the buyer. If the seller doesn't want to give the buyer his full refund, then he himself won't get anything either. There isn't a case where the seller gets his refund but still retains the option of whether to sign the buyer's refund.
In any case, these 'NashX' type contracts don't seem very interesting to me. Even if the incentives are correct, you're still exposed to risk of the counterparty losing his key, etc.

There are ways to do off-chain payments in a [trustless manner]( and we need to encourage such initiatives. In any case, to fulfill the promise of digital currency, we'll need to have instant confirmations and arbitrarily small micropayments, which will involve additional protocol layers on top of Bitcoin - on-blockchain payments aren't sufficient even at current fee levels.


The way to address this is by working to improve block propagation, either by creating [higher speed relay networks]( or by [optimizing the network protocol]( Faster propagation results in lower orphan costs and allows more fee-paying transactions to be included.

Look at it this way. In Jan 2013 the price was around $10, giving a market capitalization of about 100 million. However, the Fedwire average transaction size is [around 5 million]( (with 500,000 transactions per day), so there's no way that the bitcoin network could have supported Fedwire-levels of volume, because each transaction would have needed 5% of all bitcoins in existence, when there aren't even that many on the exchanges for sale. If there was more demand for use of the network as a payments system, the price would have to go up in order to reach equilibrium.
Today the market cap is around 7 billion. But it's still inadequate for really large volumes of payments. On Bitstamp right now, there are 15,000 bitcoins for sale, about 0.1% of the total number of bitcoins, so not a trivial number. However those 15,000 bitcoins are only worth about 12 million USD, so there's simply not enough liquidity on the ask side for large transactions. How would you convert 100 million USD into bitcoin to send over the network?
In order to increase the liquidity on the ask side, the BTCUSD price will have to increase until each bitcoin represents a far higher value in USD.

Aside from acting as a 'green address' for instant confirmations, it seems a service like greenaddress.it could act as a 'micropayment gateway' to enable off-blockchain, zero-fee transactions to payment processors such as Bitpay and Coinbase, using micropayment channels as described [here]( which also relies on nLockTime. 
If Bitpay and Coinbase were to establish micropayment channels to services such as greenaddress.it, then aside from benefiting from instant confirmations, users could also make a micropayment with literally zero tx fee.

As of this instant, Bitpay's rate is 626.10, whereas Coinbase's is 627.23. If I buy a product through Bitpay, I am effectively exchanging to USD at 626.10 each. 
If I try to sell them on Coinbase, however, the amount I will get (you can try this yourself in the form) is 627.18 - 6.27 (1% fee) - 0.15 (ACH fee) which is 620.76, which is less value than buying through Bitpay.
So Bitpay's claim that you will get better value than selling on an exchange (considering Coinbase to be an exchange at this point) is valid in this example. 
Of course comparing Bitpay's purchasing rate to Coinbase's purchasing rate (as opposed to their forex rate) is a different matter, about which Bitpay makes no specific claims in the quote you posted.

I think a good start would be a formal description of the problem. What are the goals of the Bitcoin network regarding transaction processing, and which of them are competing, and how do we decide on the optimal trade-off. 
There's been some studies on this, for example [Decker and Wattenhofer (pdf)]( describe some models for propagation time and the blockchain fork rate, and how to reduce them.
Then, [Houy, in this paper]( describes economic models for the number of transactions a miner will choose to include in his block. It's shown very clearly that by reducing network propagation time, rational miners will include more transactions per block, assuming tx fee is fixed.
All in all I think it's quite clear that the first line of approach should be to optimize block propagation speed. In principle the market should take care of this, because it allows miners to increase their revenue.
After we arrive at a lower bound for the propagation time, we can then discuss whether demand for transactions (as a function of tx fee) is sufficient to provide the mining revenue necessary for an acceptable level of hashrate/security.
I think one reason not many people are discussing this, is because current block rewards are much too high relative to tx fees, so the economics of tx fees do not even come into play at this stage - in fact, miners are currently taking a loss on their revenue by including any transactions with a fee of less than roughly 0.0008 BTC (as shown [here]( As block rewards drop, tx fees become more important and we'll start to see this issue taken more seriously.

I don't know what they usually do, but your transaction is part of a long chain of unconfirmed transactions. Your transaction is not going to get confirmed until every other prior transaction in the chain has been confirmed, and all of them have zero fee. 
You can see for yourself by following the source addresses of your transaction on blockchain.info. I followed the chain for some 20 transactions, and finally found one that has just got 1 confirmation. So looks like you'll just have to wait.

I simply asked you for your reasoning of why you deemed line of questioning to be reasonable enough, so as to render labelling of the post as trollbait to be 'weak'.
My position is that original line of questioning is disingenuous, and I made arguments in an attempt to justify it, but you didn't respond to them, so perhaps I should elaborate on them:

1. Regarding the value-add of the Foundation
2. Regarding the finances of the Foundation
3. Regarding lobbyists
4. Regarding choice to engage government
5. Please dismantle the Foundation
The typical purpose of questions that are in good faith is to glean more information, so as to be better equipped to make a judgment/decision about the matter in question. The questions posed by are entirely valid on their own merits; however, the line of questioning itself as presented by is disingenuous, as evidenced by his final demand - the line that, according to you, I focused on after chopping all the actual questions - 'Please dismantle the foundation'. 
In other words, has decided in his mind, even before hearing the answers, that the Foundation ought to be disbanded. So one can conclude that the questions were not posed in an attempt to gain information, but rather with the intent to build a case against Patrick - he's putting Patrick on trial here.
But if the aim is to put Patrick on trial before the court of opinion, obviously Patrick shouldn't engage, because neither Patrick nor the Foundation is under its jurisdiction, and to engage would be to admit to that.

The block interval cannot be too low, because it takes time for the solved block to propagate through the network. Imagine if the block interval time is on the order of seconds.

The size of the blockchain is not relevant here, it's the size of the unspent transaction output (UTXO) set. It's stored in the [chainstate]( directory, and is currently 546 MB.

Time locked tx are not inherently non-standard, they are only non-standard if the required block height has not been reached. Once lock_time is less than or equal to the current block height, they become standard and can be relayed as normal. This is different from transactions with, say, non-standard output scripts, in which case your argument bears more weight since there is never a determinate time in the future where they might become standard.
Furthermore there are many applications going forward which rely on nLockTime and which assume that nLockTime will continue to be valid. For example, the GreenAddress.it multisig wallet relies on nLockTime to provide refund transactions to users. The Bitcoin Contracts [wiki page]( describes many schemes which rely extensively on nLockTime and are under active development.
In the end it is a subjective matter but from my viewpoint there is no indication that nLockTime will be invalidated in the future. It is working today - you cannot include a time-locked tx in a block, and nodes will relay it when the lock expires. That functionality is enough for many applications which need time locks.

You don't need to send any bitcoin to prove ownership, you can sign arbitrary messages with your bitcoin key directly, not just transactions.

I'm a GreenAddress user and quite impressed with the overall design. One concern I have about the security model is the following - time-locked refund transactions are used to guarantee the user against loss of keys by GreenAddress, but this guarantee only takes place after the funds have been received into the multisig account, whereas in fact the user needs this guarantee before receiving the tx, to be properly secured against any loss on GreenAddress side. So for e.g. at the moment I receive a payment, I do not know yet whether GreenAddress will hold up its side and send me the nLockTime transactions. If GreenAddress loses its keys at time X, and I receive my payment at X + 1s, I will never be able to recover the funds.
In Bitgo on the other hand, their model allows me to recover my funds in this situation. 
I wonder what your thoughts are on this.

Digital signatures are not the same as encryption. There's no encryption of the message here, because the intent is not to conceal the message.

Yes, it's known that for [this test]( that you need to subtract 1 from the number of degrees of freedom, due to, as you say, the dependence among the variables. [The scipy implementation does]( take this into account.
The test statistic is asymptotically chi-square-distributed; apparently the distribution approaches from below, so for finite samples the p-value is biased to be lower i.e. the test errs on the conservative side.
Regarding individual rolls vs aggregating, I think you figured it out, but the aggregates are sufficient because the rolls are assumed to be i.i.d.; given the aggregate counts, each permutation of the individual rolls has equal probability - there's no further information that can be gained from them about the underlying multinomial distribution.

Fixing transaction malleability doesn't help for the case where you're receiving payments from external parties though. Even if there is no tx malleability, to be properly secured you must get the nLockTime refund tx before the funding tx is confirmed. If it is an external party who is generating the funding tx, paying into your multi-sig account, how are you going to get the nLockTime tx beforehand? This is a fundamental problem with the model that must be addressed by changing the payment workflow. 
Some [discussion here]( concerning this issue.

Here is a [contrary view]( which makes the case that volatility is decreasing, using standard deviation of daily log returns.
With regard to OP's argument, the data speaks for itself, however we know that 2012 was a quiet period with little media attention following the bust of 2011. 2013 was a rather tumultuous period of growth with many strains on the infrastructure (e.g. Mt Gox lag in April 2013), regulatory uncertainty and clarification, attention from large institutional players etc. So obviously there are many factors in play which determine the volatility, and not just the market cap.

Sorry to disappoint but you didn't get tipped at all. The Bitcoin Megaphone is simply counting the bitcoins that you received to the same address, prior to making the post. Then because of some quirks in the accounting, it's triple-counting the amount of 0.025 BTC that you received in April (minus the amount that you sent out), so that's why .07377 BTC.
If you want to keep track of your tips, you should dedicate a separate address for the tip address. If you are using Bitcoin Wallet, then you should go to 'Address Book' (from the drop-down menu at top right), then swipe to 'Your Addresses' page and click 'Add'. 
Remember to back up your wallet again after that since you are adding a new address.

The interview is good but the title of this post is misleading, taken out of context, which has led to many other posters assuming that Mike is spreading FUD, which is ridiculous.
The context of the quote was that the interviewer was concerned that nobody else but Mike would use his crowdfunding platform for funding bitcoin development, so development could become centralized in his hands.
Mike dismissed this concern because there are so few people working on protocol development anyway (only Gavin, paid by the Bitcoin Foundation), and that it is a crisis "in that sense", so it makes no sense to be concerned with his crowdfunding platform making development 'centralized' - because development is practically non-existent today.
There was no FUD, only efforts to move things forward.

If you need help with your multibit transaction the fastest way is to post the transaction ID for reference.
If you're not sure how to get the ID, you need to click on the transaction, then click on 'show transaction details' in the bottom left, which will bring up the transaction details window. In the 'raw transaction' field, the ID is the very first string of digits.  Posting the whole text of the 'raw transaction' field would be helpful as well.
This has privacy implications however because now transactions from that address can be linked to your reddit account. 
If you would rather not reveal the transaction, you can try resetting the client: in the menu bar, click on Tools &gt; Reset blockchain and transactions. Your stuck transaction would most likely disappear and you can try resending it.

More specifically, a 1 BTC, 250 byte transaction needs an age of ~ 1 day to qualify for inclusion as a free transaction. OP's tx is 0.06 BTC, so his prev output needs to be about 17 days old. Currently it's less than a day old, so there's quite a way to go unfortunately.

It's indeed non-standard because one of the outputs is below 546 satoshis as [described here]( Nodes will not relay it and regular miners won't include it in a block.

1. Double check that the transaction is indeed unconfirmed, by clicking 'Show Transaction Details' on the bottom left of the Multibit window, then 'View on blockchain.info'.  
2. Try resetting the Multibit client: Tools &gt; Reset Blockchain and Transactions. After that the transaction will most likely not be there and you can resend as normal.

You control 2 of 3 keys in a 2-of-3 multisig wallet. One of the two is held offline as a backup, presumably secure. The second is held in your hot wallet (I believe it follow the same model as blockchain.info - a locally encrypted wallet that is then stored on bitgo servers). Third key is held by bitgo.
When you want to make a tx, you sign using your hot wallet key and then send to bitgo for countersigning with the third key. Bitgo then authenticates your request through SMS/google authenticator, then signs and broadcast the tx. 
An attacker that compromises your hot wallet thus, in theory, cannot spend your funds, because he needs your mobile device for 2FA. Alternately he can break into your offline backup key. 
What I'm not clear about is the procedure for 2FA recovery, i.e. recovery when the google authenticator secret is lost / you have lost control of a certain phone number. If you can reset the phone number through your account, then there isn't really 2FA. But I don't see any other way to prove your identity, since they do not perform identity verification.

I don't think comparing bitcoin to traditional banking is the right idea here, because bitcoin has other nice properties that have nothing to do with the efficiency of the consensus scheme - for example, it is an open network that anyone can participate in. It is entirely digital, so the marginal cost of a transaction is very low, and opens the door to things like smart contracts and machine-to-machine payments. It's a bearer instrument, so you can hold and transact in it with no counterparty risk (cf. stories of paypal arbitrarily freezing accounts, etc).
On the other hand, you could have a digital financial network/crypto-currency with much of the same properties as bitcoin, but with a more efficient consensus scheme, such as alt-coins which use proof-of-stake instead of proof-of-work, or networks like Ripple that have their own non-mining consensus scheme - this I think is the appropriate comparison.
I think however it starts to get very technical, in comparing all the different consensus methods.

I took a look at the signed raw tx you pasted. It's malformed - it's not referring to the correct output (the multi-sig output), so broadcasting it won't work.
Ok think I found the problem. Under the 'spend' tab of ms-brainwallet, after entering in the redeem-script, and the private keys, you have to click 'edit inputs' at the end of 'Source Address'. 
Then, in the next line it will say, 'Use History From', select blockchain.info, then download. Then sign the transaction as per normal. This should give the correct raw tx. The reason is you need to specify the exact output that you are spending from - the multisig output in this case. Without getting the info from somewhere, in this case blockchain.info, there's no way for ms-brainwallet to know where the transaction is.
Broadcasting is then another issue. There are ways to do it online but not very user friendly. Check out  if blockchain.info pushtx doesn't work.

That's overly simplistic, come on I expect better of you Mr Banker.
The orphan probability does not go to 100% if you include some transactions. The orphan probability increases as transactions get added on, and so it is a matter of whether the added tx fee is large enough relative to the probabilistic orphan cost in order to justify including it. It is expected value that they are trying to maximize, not a one-off amount. As network speed increases, the orphan cost tends towards zero.

[6 confirmations]( is sort of the de facto threshold to consider a payment as finalized and irreversible. For example most exchanges will require your deposit transaction to have 6 confirmations before they credit your account. 6 confirmations x 10 min per block = 1 hour.
But it's just a rough figure. In the future there might be systems that allow for secure zero-confirmation transactions. However in practice the velocity will probably largely be determined by the proportion of bitcoins that are held as a store of value instead of for transactions.

Bitcoin micropayment channels [(a forum thread about it here)]( is a well-known method for making trustless off-blockchain micropayments. It is not a swap line like IronVape mentioned, which would require parties to trust each other for some amount.
It requires the user to prefund a 2-of-2 multisig account between the user and the service provider (call it M1), with a pre-signed, time-locked refund transaction provided to the user, exactly like the greenaddress.it setup. Then, when the user wants to make a micropayment of amount P, greenaddress.it would create a tx spending the 2-of-2 output, with balance of, say, A, into 2 new outputs:
* Output 1 would be the original 2-of-2 account, M1, with value A-P
* Output 2 would be an single key address controlled by greenaddress.it, call it K2, with value P
and pass the tx to the user to be signed, but the tx would not be broadcast.
When a new micropayment is due, of amount P2, then greenaddress.it would create a new, identical, tx, but incrementing the amount allocated to its K2 address by amount P2. 
Then finally at any time, greenaddress can broadcast this tx onto the blockchain to claim the aggregated micropayments.
If greenaddress.it has its own payment channel with Bitpay, Coinbase, these micropayments can be chained to allow the user to pay Bitpay/Coinbase.

The title is not comparing Locks to Ripple, but the (Bitcoin network + Locks and other gateways) vs. (Ripple and its gateways). So Locks is not the only company doing this, but also for example Bitreserve, so no, the innovation is not 'limited to one company'. 
In this instance, Locks only allows redemption in BTC, but there is no reason that a similar service couldn't offer redemption in the underlying asset. 
The comparison with Ripple here is in the settlement network used between the gateways, and the argument put forth is that Bitcoin is the superior settlement network because of network effects.

If you are a Bitpay merchant, for example, you're typically pricing all your products in USD, and exchanging all bitcoin payments into USD equivalent immediately.
If, in addition, all your expenses can be paid with bitcoin, then there's no need for settlement through bank transfers; as long as you can hedge BTC/USD, you can be bitcoin in, bitcoin out, with minimal friction.
This is what services like Bitreserve do basically - extend these hedging services beyond accredited merchants. Right now I can give you a bitcoin address for payment, and if you send bitcoin to it, it will be credited automatically as USD in my account.
Whether or not they can meet their obligations is another matter of course.

Blockchain.info is a trusted service - because you are not running a full Bitcoin node, you have to rely on them to validate the transaction. There are no guarantees on the accuracy of the information they give you.
One step better is [SPV clients]( like Multibit / Android Bitcoin Wallet, which connect directly to the P2P network. You still can't tell anything about the validity of 0-conf transactions, but you can tell when the tx has received a number of confirmations, and then use that as a sign of its validity.
Of course ultimately if you are running a full bitcoin node, that at the moment you receive the tx you can determine its validity.
Without the full blockchain, and until bitcoin begins to support [UTXO commitments]( you need to rely on trusted parties to tell you about the validity of 0-conf transactions.

The 2 hours thing doesn't apply in this case. What it means is that, the block's timestamp can be off by two hours, it doesn't mean that the lock_time can be off the block's timestamp by 2 hours.
The tx's lock time must always be less than the block timestamp; in your case it was actually not, so it's solely due to the sequence numbers that it got included.

Right, those coins are lost. The reason is that the keys that you originally provided are not public keys, but bitcoin addresses. An address is derived from the hash of a public key, but in this case you needed to have entered the public keys.


It should produce the original address 3MNN7L.... (and it does in fact, for me), because the multi-sig address is simply a hash of the redeem script. What is not working is that the redeem script in fact is faulty, because it was constructed with addresses instead of public keys.
If you create a new multi-sig address with the proper public keys as shown in bitaddress, then it should work.

I guess it depends on the purpose of your table, and what is it that you are aiming to communicate.
'6 confirmations' has come to be the de facto measure of irreversibility due to historical reasons which I'm not clear about. For example many clients present transactions with less than 6 confirmations as 'unconfirmed'.  
It probably comes from the [Satoshi white paper]( in section 11 he gives some calculations about the probability of reversal by an attacker with various proportions of the network hashrate. He chose 0.1% chance of reversal as the threshold to mean an 'adequate' guarantee of irreversibility, then provided a table showing how many confirmations are needed, as a function of attacker hashpower. 
It turns out that for an attacker with 10% of hashpower (the first data point in his table), you need 6 confirmations to bring the probability of reversal to less than 0.1%. So that's how the figure probably came about. 
I'm not sure however how useful it is to promote this idea. I think eventually end-users will not be required to know about confirmations (because it requires expertise to evaluate the risk of reversal), but instead third parties will be created to guarantee instant confirmations and to take on the risk of double spending.
@_date: 2014-06-29 02:32:57


Actually this has been shown to be untrue by [Meni Rosenfeld]( back in 2012. The probability of success of a double-spend depends on number of confirmations, and the block interval has no effect. So 6 confirmations has the same security regardless of whether it is 10 min blocks or 1 min blocks.
As others have noted, however, the block interval is a trade-off between confirmation speed and blockchain fork rate.

I have a question about the BTC/PHP exchange rate. When do you bind the exchange rate for the transaction? For example if I want recipient to get 5000 PHP, I see on the form that the BTC price quoted to me is 0.18225. Is this amount binding before I send? Or will you calculate a new rate after the transaction has been confirmed, so that the receiver might receive slightly more or less than 5000?
If it is the former, (for e.g. the way Bitpay does it), when does the exchange rate quote expire? (For Bitpay it is 15 min for example). Since you are in effect offering a put option on BTC/PHP for free, how do you manage your risk in this case?

If you look at snapswap's [fee page]( you'll see there are different kinds of fees. How ripple works is that it allows companies to issue IOUs, which can then be traded between anyone. So for snapswap, you would make a bank transfer to their account, which apparently comes with a 1% fee, and in return you get snapswapUSD IOU tokens which you can transact with similar to how you can send bitcoin around. This is the part that is almost free - to send these tokens to others. 
But what you want is USD in your bitstamp account. Bitstamp will accept their ripple tokens bitstampUSD in exchange for USD credit in your account, so you need to exchange snapswapUSD for bitstampUSD. So in ripple there are people acting as market makers to provide the liquidity for these exchanges, for example [here]( you can see the order books for offers to exchange the ripple token pairs, for e.g. you can see the order books for bitstampUSD/snapswapUSD, it will cost you about 1.02 snapswapUSD for each 1.00 bitstampUSD, or a 2% spread. 
Adding this 2% to the 1% snapswap bank transfer fee and you get about 3% in fees.

Comparing raw bitcoin directly to credit card networks is not appropriate IMO; they are different levels of the payments stack - credit card networks are built on top of correspondent bank networks, which are built on top of central bank clearing systems (Fedwire in the case of USD).
The better analogy would be with a RTGS (real-time gross settlement) system like Fedwire. Fedwire transfers, like bitcoin, are [final and irrevocable]( once processed and don't have customer protections either since it does not interface with the customer (see [this blog post]( by for a comparison of the two).
The difference between Fedwire and bitcoin is that bitcoin does not depend on a central party to maintain the ledger, and it pays the price in terms of the hashing network required. Whether this is a good tradeoff depends on your point of view, and how the network evolves in the future.
With regard to consumer payments - additional payment layers will most definitely be built on top of bitcoin just like current payment methods ([BIP 70]( is an example of this, adding PKI in order to secure payment identities), so as to add consumer protection (see [Stripe's bitcoin blog post]( for some ideas on this) and also things like instant confirmations and fee-less micropayments, which are all a necessary part of the consumer payments infrastructure.

* There are various reasons why a peer does not propagate a transaction. In a rough order of frequency they are:
* 2.1) There are lots of satoshi sized inputs in your wallet and the transaction fires the anti-spam rules.
* 2.2) The fee is too small and the peer chooses not to relay it.
* 2.3) The transaction is a double spend. Doubles spends aren't relayed through the network.
* 2.4) Some other reason - this is not a definitive list.
How much fee are you including?

From the changetip faq, it says


So you can't use it for real time payment. 
1. Try to see if there's an option to cancel the withdrawal, from within your changetip account. 
2. If not, you have to see whether the withdrawal has been processed. In your changetip account, under 'Withdrawal History' it should show the withdrawal transaction, and the address to which you have withdrawn to. You can check the transaction on  if you don't know how then post the withdrawal address here so someone can check for you.
3. If the withdrawal hasn't been processed, you can try contacting changetip to cancel the withdrawal.
4. If it has, then you need to contact eGifter for your refund. You'll need to provide them the address that you sent the coins to, as well as a refund address (be sure that they don't refund you to the address that the coins were sent from, because that's probably not the address that credits your changetip account. If you want the refund to go back to your changetip wallet, then you have to find your Changetip wallet address, within your account under 'Deposit'.

According to blockchain.info the transaction was only broadcast minutes ago; it got picked up in the latest block, which is at fast as it gets.
If you gave the instruction to send 4 hours ago, then the problem is on Coinjar's end - their system didn't actually send the transaction until 10 minutes ago.

Thanks for your reply. Of course I have no intention to be argumentative or cast aspersions on anyone, so I'm glad you clarified your position.


I don't see a problem with that. Let's put it this way, however. At least a fraction of those 5800 bitcoins came from me, because I've been a fee-paying member of the Bitcoin Foundation for 2 years; and I am satisfied (at the moment) with the Foundation and its actions to this point.
What gives you the right (and I mean this politely) to call for these funds to be diverted to an alternate cause, funds that you did not contribute to? (You're presumably not a member, correct me if I'm wrong.) I have contributed these funds because I believe in the mission of the Foundation, and that it is beneficial for Bitcoin as a whole. 
(As a side point, I have also donated in the past to other endeavours likely to be more palatable in your eyes, such as Armory Technologies.)
Patrick Murck, from what I can tell, is one of Bitcoin's strongest and most diligent advocates. I've seen what he has done for the community from the beginning, I've seen the statements he's worked on and put out, the testimonies he's given before Senate Committees, the media interviews he's given, and I'm happy that I've contributed to his salary.
A lot of work that the Foundation does is advocacy-based - explaining Bitcoin to regulators, finding common ground, encouraging sane policy. The benefit of this is extremely subjective; how do you expect him to place a monetary value on this?  This is an honest question - this is perhaps part of the reason why your post was labelled as 'trollbait'; because the value of this activity is subjective (and low in your eyes), it's not a 'simple question' - there seems to be no way to answer it satisfactorily because you already have decided it is of low value (for e.g. in your comment about engaging government vs. software development).
I'm sure the Bitcoin Foundation would love to be on amicable terms with but if commenters are starting from the premise that engaging with government is a waste of resources, how do you expect to find any common ground from your questions?
Is this really so controversial that it would split the community? I can accept that you find a low value in these activities, but to deny others the right to hold the opposing view without judgment? In my view Bitcoin already has enough external problems; it can do without all these internal struggles. Let everyone contribute to the bitcoin system as he sees fit.

What do you see for the future of microtransactions? Now you can do that off-chain on Coinbase but it requires the customer to have a Coinbase account, which is not ideal. But we have things like payment channels, which are trustless.
What are your thoughts on identity systems on the blockchain? i.e. moving forward from bitcoin addresses to human-readable addresses. Coinbase provides payment pages, but there are many competing systems e.g. Onename.io, keybase, etc, also there are privacy issues with publishing your addresses online. What do you think is needed to make bitcoin payments more usable from an identity point of view? E.g. are stealth addresses a solution?

To add on, you could actually get others to build on top of your orphaned block, in the hope of overtaking the main chain. If successful, then your block is now on the main chain, and the rest become orphaned.
In bitcoin terms, this would be called a "re-org", short for chain reorganization. 
The longer you wait, however, the lower your chances of pulling it off, as the main chain pulls ahead. That's why, for example, people sometimes wait for 6 confirmations before considering a transaction to have cleared.
@_date: 2014-06-23 13:41:57
The advantage of smaller blocks in terms of block propagation is indeed proportionate with scaling of network speed, however the profit maximizing miner (which we are assuming they are doing, by restricting block size now) will always include additional transactions as long as the transaction fee is greater than the marginal orphan cost. So at sufficient network speeds, the profit maximizing block size may be arbitrarily larger than 250 kb or whatever, depending on the demand for block space relative to the min tx fee. Miners have an economic incentive to move to higher throughput, lower latency networks in order to include as many transactions as possible.
Interestingly, Gavin Andresen did some calculations of the orphan cost of a tx [here]( the figure obtained was about 0.8 millibitcoins, in other words, currently the most common fee paid (0.1 millibitcoins) is about 8 times lower than the profit maximizing amount.
Just to round up the analysis.

Multibit stores backups of your wallet in several different locations, so if your wallet file is corrupted, you can check the other locations.
First find your data directory, instructions [here](
Then look in the subdirectory ./multibit-data/ (or &lt;walletname&gt;-data depending on what name you gave your wallet), and you'll see several backup folders. You should be able to find a copy in wallet-backup/ or rolling-backup/. Then open it as normal from within the Multibit client.

Using the ripple method might be faster but it's highly unlikely to be cheaper at this point than a wire transfer. The method described to you involves buying XRP using snapswap USD credit, then buying bitstamp USD credit with the XRP. That's like saying, to fund your bitstamp USD account, you should buy BTC on coinbase, then send the BTC to bitstamp and sell it there.  But of course that's ridiculous since your goal is to buy bitcoins anyway.
To be specific, XRP/snapswapUSD ask price is $0.00444, while XRP/bitstampUSD bid is $0.00436, so basically for every $1 you put in through snapswap, you'll get $0.982 out at bitstamp, a 2% loss, simply through exchange spreads, and that's not counting snapswap fees which seems to be another 1%.

You can't ignore the effect of this on the price, because there is a hard limit to the bitcoin velocity of money, due to the time taken for block confirmations.
The highest velocity that can reasonably be attained (for on-blockchain transactions) would be perhaps once per hour. So with 21 million bitcoins, the max total value that can be transferred over the network per day would be  
    maxUSDPerDay = BTCUSDValue * totalNumBitcoins * maxVelocityDay = 600 * 21e6 * 24 = USD 302.4 billion 
using the current BTCUSD value of $600.  So at the current price, the absolute greatest USD transaction volume that the network can support is 300 billion per day. In practice, the velocity is much much lower because a lot of bitcoins are being used as a store of value, so the actual attainable USD volume currently might be something like 3 billion per day.
In comparison, [Fedwire]( daily volumes are about USD 2.8 trillion. If the volume in the bitcoin network reached 1% of that, the BTCUSD price would have to be around $5000.
(assuming that the calculations are correct)

Block 357688 took place at 10 am UTC, not 10 pm, I'm assuming you meant that instead?
But then on your previous announcement post, you said 10 pm... so I'm not sure how anyone else could have participated in this round.
You said you submitted transactions at the rate of 3 per minute.. the typical rate is ~ 1 per second, so you would have increased the traffic by around 5 percent, not really a significant amount.
Looking at the traffic during that period, I find it hard to believe that it took 8 hours even with lowest possible fee.. would you mind perhaps sharing the transaction IDs (given that this is an open experiment).

In your [second link]( I see that address there, but it is under the 'send' tab, that means that address is one that you have sent bitcoin to, out of your multibit wallet, and it does not mean it is for receiving. For receiving bitcoin you have to use the 'Request' tab. 
So who does 12EFht1oW3h2ybNYP2NrJKF26oPicFs8mM belong to? It seems like it is someone you have sent bitcoin to before, specifically on 4th Mar 2014, and it is not under your control i.e. not part of your wallet.

Those transactions are largely zero-fee transactions, that's why there's a large backlog.
For fee paying transactions, typically they all get cleared pretty rapidly.
@_date: 2014-12-01 14:30:10
You should lodge a complaint with them, perhaps. 
Anyway your tx has enough priority to get confirmed for free, but not every miner nowadays includes free transactions in their blocks. Your tx is at about the 200 KB mark of backlog of high priority transactions, and the default miner only allows up to 50 KB of high priority txs per block, so it will be at least around 4 more blocks before your tx gets confirmed, likely more. My guess is confirmation in ~ 8 blocks, or just over an hour.

The results are [here]( but unfortunately there's no documentation as of yet.
The methodology is pretty simple though. It just looks at the mempool transactions at the time that blocks are found, and observes which feerates are included and which are excluded, assuming that the majority of transactions are prioritized greedily by feerate.
From these estimates we can actually construct a queueing model of the network and use simulation to predict the transaction wait time as a function of feerate: [link](

It's not entirely altruistic. If you don't have a full node and you want tx data, you're forced to use 3rd party services like blockchain.info, whose data might or might not be correct. If accurate data is important to you, there's no substitute for having a full node.

If you are the tx sender:
1. Wait until the tx drops out of the mempool (which happens very gradually) then double spend your own transaction, with a higher fee.
2. Alternatively, find miners which use a [replace-by-fee]( patch. I'm not aware of any who do.
If you are the tx recipient:
Your only option is to find a miner which uses a [child-pays-for-parent]( patch. Again I'm not aware of any who do it in a consistent manner.

Exactly, which is why people have been talking about hub-and-spoke payment networks based on micropayment channels, for at least a few years now.
The idea being, as a user you don't want to have to manage numerous channels - however at the same time not all merchants / users want to connect to the same provider, for various reasons (lousy UI, language barrier etc) - hence a network of providers, who are able to route payments amongst themselves.

E.g. you want to find out how many confirmations your transaction has received, you would typically use blockchain.info to find out, although you could also use [SPV]( wallets.
A more relevant example would be if you want to test the validity of a tx on the network that hasn't yet been included in a block (i.e. a 0-conf transaction). SPV doesn't help you here - if you don't have a full node, you have to rely entirely on a third party/parties to tell you about it.
@_date: 2015-01-03 01:31:05
The channel amount can't be double spent by the payer because the payer first makes a lump sum payment into a multi-sig address, that is jointly controlled by payer and payee. This is the establishment of the channel, from which incremental amounts are paid. Double spending would require a signature from the payee, who presumably will not agree to defraud himself.
The payer also can't be defrauded of his initial deposit because a nLockTime transaction is used as a refund transaction to be broadcast in the event the payee disappears with the deposit.
You can read more about it [here](

He probably means something like a payment channel to the exchange. As of now if you want to retain control over your bitcoins while trading, you would hold on to them and only send them to the exchange when you want to execute an order. However, you would experience a delay due to network confirmation times.
If payment channels are used on the other hand, you can retain control while making instant incremental payments to the exchange whenever you execute an order.

The typical reasons for transactions not confirming are -
1. Insufficient tx fee.
2. Transaction is non-standard - for e.g. the output amounts are below the typical "dust" threshold of 546 satoshis.
3. The input transactions are themselves unconfirmed.
In this case it's a combination of 1 &amp; 3 - the input transaction has no fee and remains unconfirmed, thus preventing the current one from being confirmed.
@_date: 2015-01-09 14:53:44
This is about rebroadcasting transactions that for some reason have poor propagation. It doesn't help the transaction to get confirmed faster, because the transaction fee is exactly the same.

Not quite sure what you mean by this.
OP's post is about sending money to Cuba via BTC, and you grant that the recipient, who needs local currency, is able to obtain it because others want to use the BTC to spend globally. So the flow is both ways - BTC in (remittance) and BTC out (spending). If the two flows are matched then BTC will trade at the same price as on the international market, and there's no need for any dollar movement.
If however there is an imbalance in flows, then a price differential will emerge. Because of the cost of sending dollars, it can't be arbitraged easily. This will mean one of two things: 
1. Spenders will gain a discount on purchasing globally (if there is too much remittance inflow)
2. Remitters will gain a bonus (if there is too much spending outflow).

Feerate is satoshis per kB of transaction size, while wait time is the difference between -

@_date: 2014-07-09 12:47:32
From the article :


I think there are many use cases for bitcoin in which the user is not exposed to the BTC/USD value at all, by swapping in and out of their local currency and using bitcoin simply as the vehicle currency. For example, sending a remittance by buying bitcoin locally and having the remittance recipient sell on his side. In these kinds of scenarios, the deflationary aspect of bitcoin does not matter at all.
There are many in the industry who are focused on these kinds of applications, using bitcoin as a payment system and not as a currency. Even if Bitcoin fails as a currency (which has yet to be determined), it can thrive based on these applications alone.

It really depends. My node is set with limitfreerelay=0 (to focus on fee-paying transactions) and minrelaytxfee=5000 (the default from a few versions ago), and my mempool regularly gets cleared out to zero. [Example](

@_date: 2016-06-02 03:36:47
BTW the cutoff in that graph is because the node's minrelaytxfee is 5000; it's possible that miners' min fee rate are lower than that, but you can only estimate down to your own minrelaytxfee.
Also, the graph doesn't say anything about confirmation by coin-age priority; for 's transaction, that's seems to be the only possible reason why it managed to get confirmed.
In fact, OP's transaction just got confirmed after 2 days, suggesting that some miners still have non-zero priority block space.

Which part of the process is looking blurry to you?  The buying side, or the selling side?
I don't know about buying in France (probably from Kraken / Bitstamp through SEPA transfer, though), but in the US you can sell through Coinbase, or even LocalBitcoins.
The more tricky part is the FX risk - i.e. change in BTC exchange rate while you are sending the coins over.  Main question is, after buying the bitcoins, how long until you can withdraw them (i.e. post the transaction to the blockchain). For example some exchanges might have a holding period of up to 1 day.  There are ways to mitigate this however.
On the other hand, have you considered using services like TransferWise?  Their rates should be quite competitive. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 06:22:10
How large is your transaction? We'd need to know to calculate the fee rate.
As of this moment, the backlog transactions  (~ 40 MB) mostly have a fee rate of &lt; 40,000 satoshis/kB (only 450 kB of transactions have fee rate &gt;= 40,000).
If your transaction is small (say &lt; 250 bytes), that would make the fee rate greater than 40,000, and that's high enough to not have any delays currently..

That's talking about currency issuance.  Here we're talking about keys (or code as you put it), they're analogous to passwords.
According to [this site]( the total number of "codes" used to-date is 120 million.  The total number of possible codes, on the other hand, is 2^160, as others have mentioned.  We're about 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000001 of the way to using them up.

[Source]( Given the consistency of their block sizes, it's likely a block size policy change as opposed to a minrelaytxfee change.
F2Pool (~ 20% of hashrate) appear to have just switched to a minrelaytxfee of 0.0005 BTC / kB, which has lead to them producing small blocks for the last 6 hours or so.

Bitcoin Core has it, but it's based on historical averages and doesn't take into account transaction spikes like these.
This [site]( attempts to calculate the required fee rate (satoshis per kB of transaction size) for various confirmation times, taking into account current mempool size and transaction arrival rates.
@_date: 2015-07-02 13:18:14


You have the right idea, it's just a matter of scale. You have to ask, "how big must the space of possible keys be, so that this won't be a problem?".   You say all will "eventually be used", but in what kind of time frame, exactly?  What do you consider as a suitable figure for the probability of chancing upon someone's code, that is small enough so as to be negligible for all practical purposes?  After that, then you can look at Bitcoin's key space and see if it lives up to your standards.


No, it's the Bitcoin network that collectively keeps track of the spending, through what is known as "mining".


These are very technical questions that are not easy to answer in an infographic. The best place to start is the [original paper]( published by the inventor, or you can read the [cryptography mailing list posts]( the inventor initially made to publicise the system.  Next step would probably be the [Bitcoin wiki]( 
@_date: 2015-07-13 02:56:22


This is not really true. The default settings cap the amount of space allocated to high-priority (coin age) transactions to only [50 kB]( The rest of the space is for fee-paying transactions; transactions are prioritized by their fee rate (coin age priority is only used to break ties between transactions with the same fee rate).
@_date: 2015-07-26 04:26:28
We assume that miners are trying to maximize fee revenue per block, and thus are faced with the knapsack problem where "mass" is the transaction size. The greedy approach of prioritizing by fee per unit tx size is at least an approximation to the optimal solution, whereas this is not true for "fee per output" - the transaction could be arbitrarily large, by containing many inputs.
Granted that "fee per output" is preferable from a usability point of view, but how can we enforce this on miners? Already, many are using their own custom mining software, which perhaps improves upon the greedy algorithm (child-pays-for-parent is an example).
Are you proposing a consensus rule for fees? This would be something new altogether - how would this work? I think you've said before that the fee amount should be fixed. How should the figure then be determined? What happens when there are large changes in the BTC/USD exchange rate?

@_date: 2015-07-25 03:31:38
Something doesn't seem right - although as you say there's an increase in transaction rate, there's no discernable increase in [avg block size](
One possibility I can think of is if is running a replace-by-fee node, and there is significant RBF tx volume - these would perhaps raise the measured tx rate, whereas the avg block size would not be affected.
This leads to the point that measuring transaction arrival rate is not enough - one needs to measure transaction departures, because there are two ways in which a transaction can leave the mempool - either by being included in a block, or being invalidated by another block transaction (removed as a conflict).
Tracking the removed conflicts would give a fuller picture of what is going on.

This fee amount would have been enough, prior to the spam attack that started almost a week ago.  Unfortunately it's not enough now.
The spam attack brought to light the fact that most wallets are not capable of dealing with a transaction surge like this (either by correctly predicting the fee you need, or by providing a convenient interface to double spend the tx, with higher fees).
So wallets will probably be prepared for the next time such a spam attack occurs, but unfortunately for now people like yourself are having trouble.
There are ways to double spend it properly and get it included, but it's not trivial.
Also, BTW, the "Medium priority" shown by blockchain.info doesn't really mean anything as far as I have been able to tell.
@_date: 2015-07-13 03:20:00
That's right - they might be using a custom implementation.  For example Eligius has a selection algorithm that attempts to discriminate "spam" txs from legitimate ones.

Best thing you can do is to send feedback to BreadWallet. 
Your transactions are paying a fee rate of 8444 satoshis / kB, whereas there is ~ 90 MB of backlog at a fee rate of 20000 sats/kB. It might take another day for the transactions to be confirmed.
@_date: 2015-07-13 09:38:07


That's not entirely accurate, by default - since v0.10, you [need sufficient coin age priority]( if the transaction is below minrelaytxfee - otherwise it won't be relayed at all.
To turn off this default behavior you would need to set relaypriority=0.

I actually agree with you, but in the long run. At the present moment, companies have to meet the needs of actual consumers, and the average consumer at this point does not really have a desire / need for an alternative unit of account - this of course could change.
The market for cheaper payments, on the other hand, is much more broad, and payment friction is a problem that is much more immediately relevant.
@_date: 2015-04-03 06:20:47
They're likely making use of the liquidity already available on various bitcoin exchanges - it means they don't need to supply their own capital to meet liquidity demand.
Thus it seems like they're just an interface layer on top of the bitcoin exchange network - acting as the middle man between the exchange and your bank account. Of course this is not to imply they aren't providing a valuable service.
@_date: 2015-04-14 12:31:11
The reason is that your change output is too low - it's less than 576 satoshis, so other nodes are rejecting the tx. This is called a 'dust' output.
If you were using blockchain.info's wallet, then it's a bug with their wallet - this is not supposed to happen normally. I'd advise you to switch to using a different wallet - blockchain.info doesn't really have a good track record till date.
As for the funds - everything is still there. Although the tx appears on blockchain's explorer, most of the network would have rejected it, so it is as if the tx had never been sent.
If you know private key management, you can export the keys to a different wallet and then you can spend from there.
@_date: 2015-04-14 13:47:25
Programming API? Do you mean that you're not using the blockchain.info web wallet?
What are your requirements for a wallet, and what do you need from the API?
@_date: 2015-04-03 03:57:50
You have a couple of options.
1. Try to double-spend the transaction (i.e. resend), this time with higher fees
2. Ask the recipient of the tx to spend it again with higher fees (to trigger child-pays-for-parent in some miners).
First option might not be easy to do depending on your level of familiarity with wallet software. Second option might not work, but there's no harm trying. You can actually do both simultaneously.
Third option is just to wait it out for a couple days. It depends on how urgently you need the tx to confirm.
BTW fees are very important so one has to ensure your wallet adds the proper fee before sending (a good wallet should never let your tx be stranded like that due to zero fee - I'm not sure what happened here that blockchain sent your tx without fee).
@_date: 2015-04-14 12:55:59
Nice. What would be even cooler is if the multi-sig escrow that they use could also function as a smart derivatives contract - the payee being guaranteed to receive a USD equivalent amount of BTC, like the way [Abra]( claims their platform works.
@_date: 2015-09-09 15:31:57


where did you get this figure from?
Anyway 1 key does not necessarily equal one UTXO, which seems to be what you're implying. The first key in the OP splits up the 0.5 BTC into outputs of 0.00001 each. So that's a lot of outputs.
If the rest of the 200 BTC are all likewise split into 0.00001 outputs, that's 20 million outputs.  Each tx input is 180 bytes, so in total that's (at least) 3600 MB worth of transactions!
Given that we can clear on average 144 MB per day, it will take 25 days to clear the backlog, even assuming that there are no other incoming transactions.
EDIT: Some additional math on transaction fees -
Since each input is 180 bytes, and each is worth 0.00001 BTC, the highest possible fee rate is about 0.00005 BTC / kB, assuming the transaction spends everything to miner fees. This is relatively low so most normal transactions shouldn't be affected.
@_date: 2015-09-09 15:48:58

Neither of those measures (which I believe were also available in earlier versions) help in the current situation though.
Those measures only restrict growth of low fee transactions. Whereas currently the spammed transactions are paying a relatively high fee.
@_date: 2015-09-02 04:00:31
The spammed transactions (60 MB at this point) have a fee rate of ~ 0.0004 BTC / kB (for e.g. see [here]( or you can check your own mempool), so your small mempool is not due to either of these settings.
Your small mempool is probably due to your node missing out on a transaction within the long chain of spam transactions, thus rejecting all subsequent dependent txs - I've seen this happen quite often during past stress test events.
@_date: 2016-10-26 10:40:26
If it's stuck behind 4 megabytes, it'll generally take longer than 4 blocks to confirm; I think you're forgetting the arriving txs. Depending on the arrival rate, it could take far longer.

This is in my view absolutely the way forward - no bitcoin branding at all.
Some companies already offer dollar-denominated bitcoin accounts - such as Bitreserve and Coinapult Locks - but its branding is still associated with bitcoin, which is of absolutely no help / relevance to the customer.
[ZapGo]( is another company that also appears to be going down this route - framing their product as a traditional online payment service.  This is also in line with Stripe's [perspective on Bitcoin](
Next step is for payment protocols to become more sophisticated (e.g. handling multi-sig escrow and refunds in a consistent way).
@_date: 2015-11-30 04:39:48


It's 0.0001 per kB of tx size though. Here the tx is ~ 1/4 of a kB, so his fee rate is ~ 0.0002, which is typically more than sufficient.

Assuming they have access to international wire transfers, there's no real issue. They however would need to have a stock of shillings to meet the liquidity demand, then to replenish they would sell BTC on overseas exchange, then wire transfer into their local bank.
That's assuming that all their transfers are inbound. If inbound and outbound transfers are matched then there's no need for any wire transfers - shilling payouts come from those making outbound transfers (i.e. buying BTC locally with Shillings).
The difference between inbound and outbound, they would have to settle it by a wire transfer. However since they can do this in batches, the fixed cost of a wire transfer is amortized over all the customer transactions. So this way they can still offer a competitive rate.

I don't really know what is the exact relationship between Abra and their tellers.
I guess it depends on how their smart contracts work, and there aren't many details about that.
Theoretically they don't need to have any relationship at all. The tellers just need to find their own liquidity source e.g. their local bitcoin exchange. Then from Abra's point of view the tellers just need to act as an interface to create the smart contract for the customer, by paying bitcoins into an [oracle script](

Exciting stuff. Wonder when we'll see a decentralized version of this model i.e. SWIFT for bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-27 07:32:05
From what I understand about Abra, it's not the same in that Abra is not a custodian of user funds. Apparently the user holds the private key himself which controls a blockchain-based smart contract. That's why, for example, Abra's price peg will expire after 3 days.
This is different from ZapGo's model in which you buy prepaid credit from them that is convertible to BTC on demand. It's comparable perhaps to e.g. Bitreserve. I would say it's an improvement on Bitreserve as they take away the bitcoin unit of account completely, which is confusing for mainstream users.
@_date: 2015-03-28 14:26:48
The threshold is per txout, not per transaction, so the number of outputs is not relevant - as long as [one txout]( goes below the dust limit, it's not accepted by standard clients.


It's the node's minrelaytxfee setting that determines the dust limit. Currently the default is 1000 (which is what most miners use too). So using the typical txout size of 34 bytes, nSize will be 182,
and nValue threshold will be 3 * ( minrelaytxfee * 0.182 ) = 546.
The reason why many still think the dust limit is 5460 is because the previous default minrelayxfee was 10000, and it was reduced to 1000 some time back.

I always assumed that the fee you specify in Electrum was the fee rate, and not the absolute fee. From this incident it seems like that's not the case. If so, it's a flaw as it'll lead to users' transactions getting stuck, as we have here.

Around 75 days actually - you can find out by entering the txid at [this site]( This is the time it would take for the coins to age sufficiently to be considered 'high priority'.
Some pools have a min block size, however, so it could get confirmed earlier than that, but that's hard to predict.
Your best bet would be to try to resend the tx in a day or two. But that might be tricky, let us know if you need help
@_date: 2015-02-17 02:37:02


exp(-x) where x is the ratio of the time interval of interest (80 minutes in this case) to the average block interval of 10 min (i.e. x = 8) is both :
* the probability that no block will be observed in the given time interval
* the probability that the wait time for any given block will be greater than that amount of time.
For your approach, the figure of 166 days would be correct if you fix the 80 minute segments beforehand, e.g. starting from tomorrow, 0000h - 0120h, 0120h - 0240h, etc. Then yes it would take 166 days before you observe one such segment with no block in it. But this is different from measuring the time between blocks, because in this case the windows would have to be chosen conditionally, based on knowledge of the block times.

see [here]( basically with CLTV you don't need a refund transaction at all, so there's no malleability risk.
@_date: 2015-02-05 14:28:16
Or they could simply neglect to send you the time-locked refund tx after you have made the deposit into the 2-of-2 (not impugning the trustworthiness of devs - talking about the security model)
I'm not sure why this weakness isn't being brought up in discussions about this kind of multisig model - it's pretty significant to me. That's why, for example, in micropayment channels a la bitcoinj (or even bitpay's impulse), the counterparty is supposed to give you the signed refund transaction *before* you broadcast the tx that funds the 2-of-2. But that means you can't deposit asynchronously into the wallet, like you do with normal bitcoin addresses.
@_date: 2015-02-25 15:41:48
Ah, glad to see it's confirmed.


Zero-fee transactions have always been relayed (albeit rate-limited) up until v0.10.0. That's why it appears in blockchain.info and other blockchain explorers, for example. Now, however, zero-fee (&lt; minrelaytxfee) txs require high priority to be relayed, so if the miner was running default v0.10, he wouldn't have seen the tx.
This tx was mined by BitMinter; I took a look at their block statistics. It seems like they are running with -blockminsize=350000, so that's why the tx got mined.
@_date: 2015-02-15 07:53:13
Poisson process &lt;=&gt; the inter-arrival times (i.e. block intervals) are i.i.d. exponential.  The probability of a block interval exceeding 80 minutes is 0.00033, so it occurs at an average rate of 1 per 1/0.00033 ~= 3000 blocks. But this is only 21 days, not 166.
@_date: 2015-02-05 14:51:19


Yes that's right, thanks for clarifying. This is a discussion about threat vectors though, so it's good to discuss them transparently.  I look forward to CLTV being able to solve this.


Personally I think 2-of-2 is nice in that it's hard for the user to screw up by e.g. accidentally posting his backup key somewhere. Hopefully the model can be made watertight.
@_date: 2015-02-25 15:29:15
The required fee being proportional to the transaction size is not simply a rule that's dictated by Bitcoin Core, it's also economically rational because the marginal cost of adding a transaction to your block comes from the increased block orphan probability, which is proportional to tx size (for now at least, before fancy set-reconciliation block-propagation).
So it's not simply a matter of changing Bitcoin Core, because ultimately miners will choose the economically rational option, i.e. the fee market will prevail.
Your points about the ideal customer experience do hold; however they will have to be implemented at a higher level of abstraction.

Using the KNC Jupiter rig as a benchmark, with lifespan of say 10 years, electricity costs of $0.15/kWh, then over the lifespan of the rig the hardware costs are about 60% of electricity costs, or ~40% of the total cost. It's lower than I expected, but I'm not worried about the electricity consumption of the Bitcoin network because the market will drive mining to areas with the lowest energy costs, and there are perhaps ways to reuse the waste heat generating by mining which reduces the cost even further.

It's not surprising that a pool with &gt; 33% of the hashrate can do unpleasant things; the crux of their argument therefore seems to be the claim that γ can be made close to 1, enabling small pools to exploit the network; they did not give much justification for this claim, and I'm not sure how feasible this would be. And there are perhaps many ways which γ can be made lower than the value of 0.5 which their proposal achieves - for e.g. a 'meta-pool' of honest pools with reliable communications and low latency.
The paper's working assumption is that the network is random and unstructured - there is probably scope for some degree of centralized direction of the network layout which does not compromise the decentralized nature of the mining process.

Take a look at [this thread]( from 2011 after the first major crash, and also it's good to read up a bit on Bitcoin's history. People have been writing bitcoin off for years after each crash, saying it's the end. To have continued holding in 2011 after a crash from 30 to 2 dollars, up till the present value of 900, requires a firm belief in the long term future of the currency, and IMO whatever they still hold today, they have earned it deservedly for sticking with bitcoin through the bad times.

You're talking about bitcoin [contracts]( in particular the ones which are based on external state. Game developers would only need to be trusted with making true declarations about the game state e.g. winner/loser of a game, and would not be able to run away with the money.

From the June 2011 crash to the Jan 2013 start of the run-up, the price was under $10 for such a really long time. So many people were quick to pronounce the death of Bitcoin when it encountered setbacks. Even after the $266 peak in April 2013, the price dipped back on occasion to $60+ levels. It became semi-stable around $100 for some time. In addition, after the Silk Road bust just weeks ago, the price dipped to sub $100 levels, before it began this huge run up.
The fact is that, complaints about 'uneven distribution' and 'unfair advantage to early adopters' mostly surface during a bull run and when sentiment is high. Once the momentary hype dies down, everyone thinks its over, and turns their attention to other things. 
For anyone who truly believes in the technology and its potential, he has had ample chance to make a really decent return on his money. Actually the returns so far are rather 'indecent', in fact. And if Bitcoin succeeds in its goal, then there is still much room for growth.
As for early hoarders - you will find that many sold a large portion of their stash under $100, not believing it could go up any further. And one could perhaps say the same about the state we are in right now.

The ATM operator has his own USD/bitcoin balance on the exchange beforehand. If he is a net seller of bitcoins (i.e. sells more bitcoins than he buys) then over time his USD balance on the exchange will go down and he will need to convert the received ATM cash into a bank deposit, and then top up his exchange USD balance by a wire transfer.
On the other hand, if he sells on average as many bitcoins as he buys, then the ATM cash does not really go anywhere - incoming cash from buyers goes to people who are selling bitcoins at the ATM. The operator would likely withdraw his own cash profit, though.
@_date: 2013-10-30 00:50:18
The ATM is linked to an [exchange]( where people all over the world buy and sell their personal bitcoins for US dollars. When you buy bitcoin from the ATM, it in turn buys the bitcoins from the exchange. The operator makes a profit from the price markup that he charges you, in the same way that your supermarket makes a profit by charging you higher prices for apples, than if you bought them wholesale.

1. ["TCP/IP was at one time just 'one of many' different sets of protocols that could be used to provide network-layer and transport-layer functionality."]( Disclaimer I am not an expert in internet history.
2. Cost of using bitcoin has nothing to do with the bitcoin price because buying $1 worth of bitcoin will be worth $1 no matter the BTC/USD value. The analogy in terms of costs applies to the fees you pay when buying/selling BTC, the market spread and liquidity, ease of use, etc. As transaction volume increases it is very reasonable to expect these to decrease. For example Bitpay when they started out, charged 1% for merchants accepting BTC. Now they offer [flat fee]( pricing with unlimited free transactions.

You have to take into account the cost of the hardware itself. At equilibrium, theoretically the mining revenue will equal the electricity costs + the amortized cost of the hardware. As energy efficiency increases, and Joules per hash goes to zero, the ratio of hardware costs to electricity costs tends to infinity and the total electricity costs thus tend to zero. 
This is also an argument for ASIC mining over GPU/CPU mining - for the same market cap, less electricity will be expended under ASIC mining.

You can't send money that you don't have, but you can send the same money to multiple people - this is called double spending and is what the confirmations are for. In practice however double spending even with zero confirmations is difficult and rare.

Most upgrades to the core Bitcoin software are backward-compatible, meaning that it will work with older versions of the software, and there is no compulsion to upgrade. In order to do something drastic like changing the block rewards, however, it will require a [hard fork upgrade]( - meaning that the old and new versions of the software will not be compatible, and there will be two versions of the blockchain. If the community does not like the changes it will simply refuse to acknowledge the new version. It's interesting because it raises questions about what really constitutes a bitcoin, since anyone can just create his own hard fork version of the software.
I think there are parallels to constitutional law - courts have power to decide cases, but their legitimacy stems from their adherence to the constitution. In the case of Bitcoin, many consider the Satoshi paper to be the authoritative definition of Bitcoin - and a fundamental aspect of it is the 21 million hard limit on the number of bitcoins. If one were to alter it, the new blockchain would most likely no longer be acknowledged as 'Bitcoin' but rather an alt-coin. 
With regard to adding things with 'good intentions' but which subsequently goes haywire - that is why open source is powerful, because the whole world can examine and analyse proposed changes together to try to spot any flaw and hopefully limit the risk.

Hey sorry to hear about your loss. You are right that security in general needs to improve, and I'm confident that it can. After all, your bank faces a similar problem - fraud prevention for unauthorized cash withdrawals. This is why people consider bitcoin to still be in its early stages, with high risk, which in turn justifies the high potential returns. Hope that you will not be put off bitcoin, but maybe even be driven to think about how the general security of the ecosystem could be improved. Best of luck to you.

Bitcoin offers the individual freedom and control over his own money, in a way that is simply not possible with existing banking systems. This is a wonderful thing, however it comes with a cost - that is having to understand what it means to secure your computer, to secure data. 
In the future, not everyone will want to, or have to, pay this cost to benefit from bitcoin, just as not everyone has to run his own email server to use email. Secure online wallets will emerge that mandate 2-factor authentication, just as my online banking does. This has the advantage of being secure from armed robbery - even if you have a offline paper wallet now, nothing is stopping a bitcoin-savvy robber from forcing you to reveal your keys. By contrast, for example, Jeremy Allaire of the recently announced [Circle]( spoke of armed guards for the purpose of protecting the bitcoin keys of its customers.
Centralized, online wallet services are not necessarily a bad thing, in the sense in which banks today are often considered 'bad'. For example, bitcoin banks can be transparent about their holdings through the blockchain, proving that their deposits are fully backed. They can then offer to their customers the ability to customize their withdrawal limits, etc, for security purposes.
Another possibility is Bitcoin will be used primarily as a transaction network; people would not hold bitcoin directly but only purchase it at the moment of the transaction, for example as in Coinbase's instant buy. This would also remove the exchange rate volatility.
Bitcoin is powerful and therefore dangerous - it is still yet to be seen, the form in which consumers will make use of this powerful technology - let's not be afraid but proceed cautiously and soberly while still being excited about the potential that this technology offers.

1. Blockchain size. This has been debated ever since the start of Bitcoin. Rough consensus among developers is that there are solutions going forward. 
2. Bitcoin value. I'm not sure what you mean by 'price of a mining device greatly exceeds its physical value' - I assume you mean that device manufacturers set a price that is significantly higher than the marginal cost to produce - but ASIC manufacturing is a competitive market so I'm not sure how this can be true indefinitely.
3. Incentive. I think you will find plenty, if not most, of the investors adopting a long-term (5-10 years) mindset. This is a crucial part of Bitcoin's development - because a lot of the funding for Bitcoin services and infrastructure comes directly from early adopters' bitcoins. In my mind this is kind of the 'seed funding' stage for Bitcoin. Actual usage only comes as the infrastructure matures.
4. Wallet insecurity. This is an active area of development and one must look at what it could become, not what it is right now.
5. Anonymous and non-refundable transactions. Bitcoin is powerful because of the properties you mention. Being e-cash, whoever has authority to reverse a transaction would also have control over the whole system, and this introduces third-party risk into the system. With regard to consumer protection, in fact Bitcoin allows for multi-signature transactions and escrow contracts, which allow more flexibility in this area and actually potentially improves the situation. See [here]( for example.

Sorry if my post sounded like I was implying that you were complaining - I was not. 
The point I was trying to make, and I think you can agree with, is this: that while Bitcoin wealth distribution is uneven to be sure (though I may not agree with you on its severity), the basis for this uneven-ness is based on a principle as open and fair as any other - that of a free market, that people reap according to what they sow. To be sure, there was no attempt to restrict people from entering the Bitcoin system, on the contrary, there was an uphill struggle over the years to get people to believe that it was worth anything at all. In a market economy there will always be inequality - surely you do not begrudge Bill Gates his wealth, for example. Bitcoin is capitalism and the free market in a true sense - that anyone with the vision, not even necessarily the skills, can invest the little he has and reap the benefits brought about by those entrepreneurs and developers who have worked to build the Bitcoin we use today.
To say that there is a perceived unfairness, today, is in my opinion, quite ironic - because bitcoin as an asset class is still viewed as a joke by the mainstream. Because of this, any investment that a person makes today, assuming he does so with the view that Bitcoin brings real financial value to the world, has the chance to catapult him right over the naysayers of today and reap a great financial reward.

What you've described is the [colored coin]( concept. Similar schemes include [Open Transactions]( and [Ripple](
@_date: 2013-11-27 05:52:12
The difference is that Bitcoin democratizes the escrow process, by allowing parties free reign to select the most suitable escrow, or none at all if unnecessary. Because of multisig transactions, Bitcoin escrow agents cannot steal the funds, thus lowering the trust barrier for people starting up escrow services. Parties can select escrow agents based on the specifics of the transaction, for example by choosing a domain expert, or based on geographic location. It is this flexibility and openness which makes the protocol so powerful, and ripe for innovation.

The exchange (what you call trading house) has possession of the coins but the coins are owed to individual account holders just like in a bank deposit. It's a concern because the exchange can be hacked just like any online wallet, and the bitcoins can be stolen. However there are ways to mitigate this, I think the whole industry is learning as we go along - this is a new era of computer security in which [air gapping]( is becoming the norm.
In addition, there are many more exchanges in operation today than there were a couple years ago. This helps to spread out the risk - and in time it should get better.

There are two kinds of wallets - those that are hosted by 3rd parties e.g. your silk road wallet, and those that you store on your own computer e.g. electrum and multibit
You must decide which you want to use - and know that if you choose to store your wallet on your computer, that your wallet is simply a file, that if deleted or lost, will result in you losing your bitcoins. This means that backing up your wallet file is a must.
If you are new and unfamiliar with the technical aspects of bitcoin, and provided that you are not dealing with large sums, the simplest option is probably to stick with a reputable hosted wallet until you become more comfortable, e.g. your Coinbase wallet. But even then you need to be familiar with basic security measures such as 2-factor authentication.

Some points to add:
* Bitcoin is more than a currency - it's a payment network that has potential to drastically reduce worldwide transaction costs, assuming sufficient liquidity develops around it. This has value.
* Buying Bitcoin is actually an investment - you are investing in the developers and entrepreneurs behind Bitcoin. For the longest time, most of them worked on Bitcoin without pay. Even now a lot of Bitcoin startups are bootstrapped from their bitcoin holdings. Part of the 'business model' is simply to hold bitcoin and profit from the increase in value. These startups are what add value to the ecosystem. As Tony Gallippi of Bitpay says, [owning bitcoin is like owning an ETF on the whole Bitcoin space.]( Buying bitcoin at any time is a means to stimulate the whole bitcoin economy.
So while I agree that one should take a sober approach in buying bitcoin - I disagree that it's a zero-sum game. Value is being added, whether by Gavin and the core developers, or alternative client developers like Alan Reiner of Armory, or payment processors, or market makers or exchanges, even the lawyers and compliance officers who ensure that you can continue buying and using bitcoins via the existing banking system. And who knows what other innovative applications are being developed right now by people, spurred on by the growth in the bitcoin price.

It's easy to scoff at new ideas when they are in their infancy - 99% of the time you would be right, and you come off looking like a genius. 1% of the time, though, you would be very, very wrong - and that's your reward for scoffing at innovative things instead of expending the effort to learn and distinguish between the genuine and the gimmick.
I believe that the bitcoin end game will not be the early adopters cashing out, but a stable long-term value and a open payment network for the whole world to use and benefit from. This man thus is calling me a liar or a fool - that's fine, but decide for yourself, so that you won't be easily swayed by scoffers - notice he doesn't give any new facts or analysis, just a lot of assertions. 
Some additional points:
* Many of the early adopters have already cashed out at sub-$100 levels, and are now regretting it.
* Satoshi has not touched his early mining hoard, as far as we know. If he designed it to be a pyramid scheme for the purpose of earning fiat, why has he not cashed out by now, or after the first (June 2011) bubble/crash? It doesn't make sense, what is he waiting for then? Is hundreds of millions of dollars not enough for him?

The idea is that arbitrage will keep the price levels comparable at the various exchanges. Yes they will need to move fiat money, but this can be done in bulk, making fees a relatively small percentage of the transaction value.
In addition, the arbitrageurs need only be anchored to the few more liquid exchanges - contrast this with Western Union which needs to have offices at every node in the transaction network.

Market-based meaning miners individually set their own fee policies, and let the transaction fee be determined by market competition instead of hard-coded rules. The difficulty is how the client software is going to estimate what fee to pay to achieve a certain confirmation time, I'm not sure how this is going to play out. See [here]( for example.

I wouldn't say it is assumed - I think it's a personal conviction that one has to arrive at him/herself. Bitcoin has gone through many ups and downs over the years - many were quick to proclaim its end after the June 2011 crash. The fact is that Bitcoin has faced many hurdles in the past, and will continue to do so in the future - just ask the early entrepreneurs like Jered Kenna, Charlie Shrem - it's almost like banging into a brick wall over and over again. Anyone who is dismissive about the difficulties ahead has probably not been around the Bitcoin space very long. 
On that note, however, arguing that Bitcoin will never succeed because the incumbents will not tolerate it, is a fatalistic argument - no one knows what will happen, but if you believe that, then you have already resigned. Fact is that in world history, monumental shifts in the balance of power do take place, although infrequently - it all depends on whether there is sufficient drive and determination in the movement. This I think is what makes Bitcoin so fascinating for some - the chance for massive disruption. As long as there is drive in the community, then there is still a chance.


There are mainly two perspectives on its utility - the first being a superior form of money that cannot be inflated at will or manipulated by central banks for political goals, and the second, which is embraced by Silicon Valley, that it is a payment network that can reduce transactional costs for international commerce. But there is a lot more that could be said than there is space to talk about it right now.


This has to do with the nature of open source protocols and social consensus - it's not really an issue once you understand how the software works. 


Same answer as above.

The default fee has been changed to 0.1 mBTC about half a year ago, which until recently was less than 2 cents. I don't think anyone expected the huge price run up in the past month - but developers are at work on an update to the fee structure to make it market-based.

If one thinks that Bitcoin can only increase in value relative to USD, then it makes no sense for one to hold any USD - the only sensible thing to do is go all-in BTC. 
How many people, even the most bullish Bitcoin users, do this though? The percentage of your assets that you hold in BTC relative to USD indicates your belief about the direction of the price movement. The fact is that BTC/USD value can most definitely go down in the near term - spending bitcoin is really not a bad idea, you can see it as a hedge against a near term crash in value.
And you can always buy some more BTC if the price crashes.
