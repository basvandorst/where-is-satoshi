If he is so sure of that why does he care? Just enjoy the ride and buy lower then, since you gonna be able to sell soooo much higher. Why is he bitching then?

bullshit, you have no way to know that.
@_date: 2018-10-10 13:39:39
It's your speculation, you have no way to know if they are buying btc or not, you just decide to believe it based on your opinions. So don't say it like it's a fact, like all the intitutional money bs, wall street bonuses, etc... it's just hopium for the moon boys.

Don't you mean "Bitcoin is the lifeboat to the sinking ship that is socialism."?  
This posts are getting old.

Ya always the same kind of hopium. Comparing the technical difficulties of tech 50 years ago to today. Very different eras.
@_date: 2019-02-06 20:13:23
Yes, it has some use cases. It's just not game changing like it was being hyped last year.

You guys are getting a bit desperate over here... everyday the same shit posts, the same analogies...

I am sorry but we have this in Portugal... It's called MBway, you can split meals, you can send money up to ( 5k? i am not really sure ), pay with qr codes in atm terminals, generate codes with your app to withdraw cash from atm terminals ( you or a friend who recieves the code ), generate credit cards with a limit, for 1 time only purchases or 1 month cards... and all of this is instant and with no fees ( altough some banks are wanting to tax transfers with 15-20c starting from May).  
Edit: this app is linked to ur bank acc, so all this actions happen from your linked account. It's pretty great.

what agenda? wtf is wrong with u. i dont believe btc will be mass adopted and i have no agenda, just deal with it.
@_date: 2019-02-06 17:27:58
30, bitcoin should be way more user friendly by now and all the GUI should not looklike straight from the 90's.
@_date: 2019-02-06 15:50:57
If you like to base your investments on hopium go for it...

“Fundamentals are getting better “ i see that shilled since i entered crypto. Anyone care to elaborate?
@_date: 2019-04-09 09:19:23
Or as an ideology against banks, but the only tx they made were between coinbase pro and binance.
@_date: 2019-04-09 07:40:03
You mean buy bitcoin so i can dump my bags for a profit? If you guys love btc so much start using it to buy stuff and not as an get rich quick scheme.
@_date: 2019-01-06 16:38:50
It’s shit because it’s hard to use for the average joe. All the non tech savvy ppl would fk up txs if they even get to the point of figuring out how to make one or use an exchange.

Stfu with your racist bs. If this was a white guy talking about black people everyone would be crying racism. I live in Europe, is that a white continent for you?
@_date: 2019-01-07 07:17:42
You keep talking about white people and white people countries. Why don’t you emigrate to an wonderland in Africa? I bet the people in charge there are much more fair ;)

If btc doesn’t innovate and stays in this state it will never be mass adopted. Its shit as a currency
@_date: 2019-01-20 10:14:49
780-3200 thats a big jump maybe some more correction then

Maybe some crypto in the future, not bitcoin at least in its current state. It’s just not pratical. Long confirmatin periods, high fees, not anon and highly volatile. Why would i buy anything with bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-07-27 21:21:50
I dont think you know how btc and eth work. You can see the exact amount those accounts recieved ans from whom
@_date: 2018-07-27 21:15:33
Its not that mate. Look at the “o”

Yes i have spent some btc...i send it to cb pro, bitmex, binance, etc... because it's very rare for it to be accepted anywhere and it's a pain to use it. I don't pay any fee with my debit card and the transfer is instant and accepted everywhere. Also btc will never be mass adopted, on top of all the things i said there can only be 21M btcs, it's unpractical to pay for shit using 0.000001 of a btc.

" It’s going to 30k ! Mooooooooooooooooon hahahahaha all those Bitcoin short sellers just went broke lol " I am replying to this comment...  
Also that short is not profitable here narrative is being told since what "6k is the bottom" and it would have net you a very nice profit. I am not touching any crypto for a while and when i buy back i will buy eth and not btc since i think its still way overvalued for what it is.
@_date: 2018-12-20 13:23:45
Btc passes the 4k mark and we start getting this bs comments lol
@_date: 2018-12-20 14:11:08
I think it's way more retarded to predict 30k than to short this suckers rally. I am not going to do any of them tho.
@_date: 2018-12-29 15:54:56
it's half the price it was less than 6 months ago...
@_date: 2018-12-20 13:25:29
20k-3.1k, passes 4k all shorters went broke. how retarded are moonboys lol
