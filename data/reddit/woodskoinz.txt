The network wouldnt be able to handle the influx of new users when that happens, since blocks currently are already filled up during peak times. Those rediculous estimates wont happen unless the 1mb limit problem is fixed.
@_date: 2014-01-13 19:35:57
which is a problem we can't just fix by leaving ghash mining pool. Sigh.
edit: by 'we' i mean miners with significant hashing power. that's not me included unfortunately
@_date: 2015-12-31 11:23:49
Nodes that break will have to be upgraded, since an increase in blocksize is inevitable and necessary. Otherwise we'll be stuck here forever, unable to handle more users which might be destructive.
Also SW isn't enough and won't come soon enough. 
A blocksize limit increase is actually long overdue, we should be aiming for 3-4mb limits by now tbh - if we want this increase to scale into the future.
@_date: 2014-02-22 16:41:13
Cant find anything anywhere, appears to be someone buying through a weak orderbook so far. But yeah almost a 100% increase in a matter of minutes is pretty sick, wonder whats up.

In terms of volume? It's not anymore. Bitstamp and BTC-e have exceeded Gox and some chinese exchanges have too.

Wth? Not even an ETA on future updates or any sort of progress update this time. Theyve basicly said they didnt make any progress since last time...

MtGox is highly inflated, all the other exchanges are 10% 'behind'.

Ok, so?
@_date: 2014-01-08 18:02:16


Doesn't this mean that basicly the difficulty will drop... It'll always retarget to get the solve rate of blocks to be once per 10 minutes.
So what is this 'mining gear can not cope' part you're talking about? Am i missing something?
@_date: 2014-01-06 19:45:00
I was trying to post but I typo'd in the title lol. Removed it. 
Anyway, they have mined 37% of the blocks in the past 24h:
This is concerning... Meanwhile BTCGuild has been getting larger share of the mined blocks too. Together they have 65%, the past 24h.

Jeez man calm  your tits, no reason to go all caps on me. 
I was just pointing out that 6 in a row may be 'lucky', but it's also an indication of how big the pool is considering 6 in a row isn't statistically likely with a lower, more acceptable hashrate.

1. I know what variance is. I just pointed out that Ghash appears to have regained hashing power after a brief knockback, which I doubt was caused by variance.
2. This isnt (part of) a 'FUD campain', see point 1. Ghash is still a clear potential threat. You can't deny that.

It should come naturally that a 'good password' for an encrypted file container isn't one of your regular passwords... I used a combination of online password generators and adding a bit of my own randomness. I dare to say it's impossible to crack. And this is all done on an offline linux machine. (you can save these genenator pages and run them without internet connection.)
Securely storing such a password *offline and not digital* proves to be quite difficult though. If anyone has some ingenious solution I'd like to know :)

~~Also: source?~~

@_date: 2014-01-13 23:16:15
Precisely. 
So if a pool was a bit lucky in the past 24h their hashrate would appear to be somewhat higher than it actually is, and vice versa. (In case you look at the 24h estimate.)
@_date: 2014-01-11 12:19:13
Stop using Mt. Gox'  value, jeez. Its inflated because people outside of japan can't get their money out. (Or with extreme delay according to a few poster here.)
Use this instead: 
**edit**: I'll rephrase since some have obviously missed my point
Stop using Mt. Gox' value on reddit just because it's the highest. It's annoyingly inflated compared to all the other exchanges and **IMO** thus misleading. We shouldn't care for Mt Gox crossing $1000 when the global average (and majority of the volume) is around 900. 
Global average or other major exchanges breaking $1000 is a different story, and has yet to happen since the 'china crash' or w/e you prefer to call it.

I believe Ghash.io has a lot of mining power owned/controlled by themself (primarily through Cex.io), but I have no clue what % we're talking about here and any other comment would be total speculation on my part.  
@_date: 2014-01-09 08:52:46
Thats not the mining power but rather the % of blocks they've solved in the past 24 hours. They could've gotten lucky in with 35% of the nethash or unlucky with 50% of the nethash for example. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 18:44:56
nah just remove it from the default top bar. I'd like to check up on gox every now and then, so i'd rather have them keep it.

[An article on litecoin.info](  explains a bit about the Time Warp attack




This article was last updated october 2013, I think it is safe to assume you can still attempt a Time Warp Attack. **However**, it does not say anything specific about a  TWA in *combination with* &gt;51% of the network hashrate.
Any clarification on this would be much appreciated.
@_date: 2014-01-05 17:52:13
im not trying to find reasons? im just saying the 1000$ dollar mark (which is purely psychologial anyway) has only been hit on 1 exchange, while the others are mostly around 900.

No need to actively block sfsw if it's not popular enough anyway. Not everything is a group effort to block a certain implementation. btw, I'm talking about miners, not users and/or node hosters.
@_date: 2014-02-16 15:45:49
Why did you post this as a link, and not just include the url in a text post? People will accidentally click on it.
@_date: 2014-01-09 08:55:28
You can buy hashing power (cloud mining sort of) from Cex.io, which is a part of Ghash.io (or the other way around, either way they're one and the same).
I've heard that people hardly break even there, so selling the hashing power back will most likely result in a loss which probably holds people back from leaving cex.io. 
@_date: 2017-02-06 21:27:36
its much, much too early for that. 
@_date: 2014-01-13 23:24:07


The network, itself, neither needs nor requires it!
Increased network hashrate rate would make a &gt;51% attack a lot harder. So for the integrity of the network, a bigger hashrate would be something positive. 
Other than that, good points.
@_date: 2014-01-31 15:44:11
If you store an encrypted file container in your dropbox, there shouldn't be any problem. The only way to open that file container with wallet info would be guessing or brute-forcing the password, which takes longer than the existance of the universe if you got a somewhat good password.

EDIT3: Im confused now. There are, like every other china news thingy, different 'interpretations', it annoys me tbh. I have as of right now no clue which is true, and bout to sleep so wont further edit this post. You can still read the rest of this comment but keep in mind that idk which part(s) are correct. Sorry.
EDIT2: Judging from [what i've read on r/bitcoinmarkets]( it seems that this isn't a way to deposit money.

I wont update with a new screenshot of total sales of the vouchers, since I have serious doubts now.
Short version: no new money gets in

Cool, assuming this works and will keep working.
Biggest voucher available worth 50000 yuan, which is roughly 8250USD. Other two versions are 10k and 2k yuan.
EDIT: 
Its a kind of auction site. You have 12 days to purchase and there are at the time of writing 99,998 pieces of 50k yuan available (im assuming it started at 100,000, so 2 have been sold?). Provided a summerized pic.
Looking at the 2k yuan version, 24 have been sold.

I just checked their lawyer's  statement from december 6, missed that earlier, sorry. (figured i'd be something more recent) 
72% will be returned huh? Where's the rest? Did you get all your funds back?
Guess its at least some good news.

not sure how fiatleak exactly works but since they say their data is based on exchanges: not being able to deposit doesn't mean they dont already have CYN on BTCChina ready to purchase some btc with... 
Faster rate than US obviously is because its the middle of the day in China and its mindnight in US.

The distribution of wealth is not exactly something they can be proud of.
