Exactly. The real issue is the unpredictability of the gold entering the supply, plus a lot of unknowns about the amount of gold available anywhere. Why would I invest my savings into something that theoretically has infinite supply, is difficult to actively trade with huge buy/sell spreads, and that can't be used online? 
There are almost zero upsides to gold other than some historical tradition. Even in some kind of post-apocalyptic world, I don't see any reason to think the internet wouldn't be back up in seconds, and that ammo, fuel, and food are far more likely to be de facto currency.

It's all about risk. I think it's fine to leave a few bitcoin on coinbase or other exchanges because even if something happens, it's not a huge loss. And the risk is a lot less than it was at MtGOX back in the day. But for long term hodling in large amounts, holding the private key in both software and printed wallets is definitely warranted.

I'm reserving judgement on them for the moment. Asking me to wire funds in order to have a bank account verified was a big red flag. Also, their auction system sounds bizarre, when all I want to do is buy/sell quickly at a reasonable price.

A higher Fed interest rate won't necessarily translate to higher savings account rates or loan rates anytime soon. There is still a lot of cash floating around out there from nearly a decade of easy money.

People seem to have forgotten that the only reason the value got up to $1000 back in 2013 was because MtGox was starting to restrict cash withdrawals so everyone on the exchange was buying up coins to preserve capital, no matter the cost. Very few people ever actually sold coins at those temporary highs and received fiat. This high is much more stable, and the lack of liquidity last time we hit $1000 was so bad we should just ignore it.

Well that was a real kick in the pants. Instead of having two relatively professional online locations in the US to buy/sell, we're back to only Coinbase again. :(
