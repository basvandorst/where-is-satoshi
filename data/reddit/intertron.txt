Don't hate the man for seeing reality as it is.  I'm sorry he isn't in your reality distortion field.  Think about it, who probably knows more about crypto and sees it more clearly, you or the CEO of Coinbase?  It may be you that is seeing things very skewed.

Bottlecaps have no inherent value either, but they worked great in Fallout.  Our dollars have no inherent value without belief in the US economic system, I don't see how this is much different than belief in the Bitcoin economic system.

God, stop with that shit.  "Expensive nodes" is just pure hogwash.  Technology scales rapidly and is dirt cheap.  The thought that a 2 mb block vs. 1 mb block would cause too expensive nodes is laughable.

"Another option is to reduce the number of free transactions allowed per block before transaction fees are required. Nodes only take so many KB of free transactions per block before they start requiring at least 0.01 transaction fee. The threshold should probably be lower than it currently is. I don't think the threshold should ever be 0. **We should always allow at least some free transactions.**" -Satoshi Nakamoto
The current version of bitcoin is becoming unrecognizable compared to what Nakamoto envisioned.

I agree with this.  You can't roast someone's code when they stopped working on it because the fork was cancelled.  It's like judging someone's homework before they turn it in.

This was creepy and the comments were creepy.

Please enlighten me how I can sell 400 million dollars worth of BTC without affecting the market price.  Even if it was OTC, OTC buyers exist on the same planet as market buyers.

This is beautiful.

These comments are going to be a bunch of garbage that tries to spin reality.

Think about what you are writing.  You are describing an apocalypse from increasing the blocksize of bitcoin to **2 mb** from **1 mb**.  Do you understand how bizarre that is to anyone not in your cult?

Looks like [this]( wasn't your final margin call.

You need to read the whitepaper again, or the first time.

Why would he go against miner consensus and the NYA?  It seems you are the one going against Bitcoin.

Gemini.com is fantastic.

So many jealous people in this thread that wish they could actually do financial analysis and hit the mark like that.  Sometimes the pros are the pros.

*Like the current financial system*, no thank you.  Reading this article made me realize I'm actually on the big block side and Satoshi's original vision.  I thought Bitcoin Cash was stupid because the name is stupid, but now I am rooting for it.


None of that sounds like what we really want!  Doesn't everyone want peer to peer?  Did anyone get in Bitcoin so it could just repeat the financial system of banks on the blockchain?

It isn't FUD to support the coin that follows Satoshi's exact thoughts on scaling.  It is people believing in something.  Nothing wrong with that.  
"At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node."

Boy with service like that why would anyone complain...

But Bitcoin is the opposite of gold in every way.  Gold cannot be destroyed (easily) and the price is very stable.  That is why countries hold it.  I'm split between the two for what exactly Bitcoin is.  It isn't a company, but it also isn't gold, no matter how much people want it to be digital gold so they can compare it to the 7 trillion market cap of gold.
