but thats not how it works, thats not how any of this works
@_date: 2016-04-24 08:07:24
how so?  I don't see any "rules".  that is my prediction.  what's your problem mate?
@_date: 2014-10-25 23:13:16
I thought they took credit cards too?
@_date: 2014-10-16 20:04:39
That thought crossed my mind today.  I need to learn the basics of crypto first.

Checks are pieces of paper, and can be counterfeit, forged, or fraudulent.  There is a rigorous and boring physical process that each and every paper check must go through to confirm available funds.  Bitcoin (theoretically) does not have to do that. 
When cashing a large check like the OP has, the bank is going to make certain physical funds are available.  Until then, it "rolls out" smaller chunks in good faith as the check goes through processing.
Go dig around the Fed and learn some stuff.
Here is Check 21, which is trying to eliminate the sending back of cancelled checks.  YES- at one time, the bank would mail you back all the checks you wrote that cleared and were cancelled and money deducted from your account.  
And here is Reg. CC
This is all FINANCE 101 / ACCT 101 / BUS 101 stuff.  You guys should know all of this already.  (not trying to be a dick, but complaining that it takes to long without understanding the process and regulation behind it doesn't do anyone any good)

That check needs to clear bro.  In the old days, you would have to wait 7-15 days for full clearance for any funds to be available in your account, even a single dollar.  They're spotting you some up front at their risk.  Be patient.  Its a check, not cash.  Funds have to transfer.
@_date: 2014-05-04 08:25:43
WHOOOOOOSH!!!!!   Totally missed that.  Thanks.
@_date: 2014-10-25 13:52:11
But mostly you just swipe credit cards to pay for the BTC I think.  I think when cashing in BTC, you can put the cash on to the CC.  I think the size of the box is oversized to make it appear there is actually something working inside.
@_date: 2014-05-03 21:37:57
dammit- sorry
@_date: 2014-05-04 08:12:54
"Time it takes or confirmation is unacceptable"
Maybe I misunderstood OP.  I thought he was stating that it was taking too long to cash a check.  At the amount he cashed, the time table they gave him is more than acceptable based on current processes.  I don't see  how they could do it any faster.
@_date: 2014-10-17 05:26:01
thank you...on my way!
@_date: 2014-05-04 07:31:45
profits don't have anything to do with it.  The check has to be reconciled for account and routing numbers, signatures, date, pay to, amount, and written amount.  It then has to be recorded, scanned, imaged, and archived.  This has to be done on both sides (your bank, and issuing bank), and then it passes through the Fed from your bank to issuing bank.  Issuing bank then has to make sure funds are available and transfer them to your bank marked for your account number.  This is a manual physical process, and in the banking world, is a money loser (not a profit center), that is why some accounts under $1000 might charge a fee to cash a check that is not from that bank (because it has to pass from one entity to another).  Banks WANT a quicker way, but the current system is not set up that way.  Banks and the Fed are both trying to speed things up.  See here...

Ah.  This guy tells me what I was thinking how bitcoin works.  Is it really that tight?  Mt. GOX stole a bunch of this stuff.  (it could get hacked and be stolen tomorrow)  However the concept inspires me.
I've been reading "Toward and Anthropological Theory of Value".
Taken together, well;  looks like I have a lot of work and learning to do.
@_date: 2014-05-04 20:29:21
They're trying to improve it.  Check 21 sped it up a little bit.  I agree, it takes a long time for large funds though.  I had to wait over two weeks when I had a large fund check.
@_date: 2014-10-16 01:45:25
Welp, there go my accounting and finance degrees.
@_date: 2014-03-25 02:25:44
Everyone wants to be their own central bank.
@_date: 2014-05-04 06:44:41
actually no- its an antiquated system- 6 days was fast up until about 15 years ago.  Banks have to transfer between themselves overnight through their local Fed,  3 days in, 3 days out.
@_date: 2015-07-31 03:57:23
This article does not mention The Fed at all.  The Fed is its own entity.  It would have to build its own supercomputer.
@_date: 2015-04-30 00:39:06
Whats in the box...errr wall?
@_date: 2015-04-30 00:37:58
George Michael took care of that.
@_date: 2015-11-08 23:41:17
I'm buying when the sun comes up.
@_date: 2016-05-02 02:30:40
Yeah.  This is a tough one.  Since it is like finding cash, even though in data format, most laws would say it belongs to the estate.
Wouldn't it be like finding a map to buried treasure?  Sure, you can keep the map, but that treasure belongs to the estate or the owner.  Just because you have the map doesn't make it yours.
@_date: 2015-03-28 23:08:04
Why won't it still work?
@_date: 2015-03-29 01:19:30
I'm new here
@_date: 2016-05-02 01:42:03
OP would have to go over the PA from the estate sale.  If it is "as is" then he gets to keep.  But if it is "as per item", then there could be some legal wrangling.  
@_date: 2015-10-26 01:54:38
Thats a better way of putting it than anti-bank.  Thanks.
@_date: 2016-05-02 22:30:51
Its probably more complicated than that.  State's laws and such.  Hobby Chemists are essentially banned in Texas, so you know, it depends on where you are.
@_date: 2016-05-02 01:13:07
No.  They sold you a house and the property, not everything on it.  [“one must voluntarily and intentionally give up a known right.” ](  
In OP's case, the ESTATE sold him a computer.  They did not sell him bitcoin.  He is obligated to inform the estate and return the bitcoin if the estate so desires.

This is the BTC sub, so most, or almost all subscribers, are anti-fiat, anti-banks.  The underlying premise behind BTC is freedom from banks and government powers that control and manipulate the money supply.  BTC is supposed to be a true open market on currency.  So they are not against you making money as a MJ farmer, but they would rather see you have the freedom to transact in digital currency than forced in to using fiat-based currency.  I will gather to guess that many support your endeavors and would gladly pay you for your product with BTC.
@_date: 2016-05-02 00:37:32
You bought the house, not the gold.
@_date: 2016-05-02 21:14:08
so much for common law?
@_date: 2016-05-02 01:44:09
Licenses are transferable upon sale of hardware.
Bitcoin is property.
@_date: 2015-02-07 02:48:45
I wonder if that article will go in to the blockchain?
@_date: 2015-03-31 02:21:04
Thank you.  Most of this stuff confuses me.
@_date: 2016-05-02 02:09:55
The IRS considers BTC as property.
@_date: 2015-02-12 04:14:54
Why not?  Drop any message you want in to your BC when you spend it?  I am noob to BC so....

Should I join The Coalition or The Federation?  hmmmm
@_date: 2015-02-17 23:30:16
oh wow!  Thank you very much!

The blocks are too big for me.  I don't have $100k
@_date: 2015-10-26 22:12:08
