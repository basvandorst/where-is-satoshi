Nice try FBI anti-money laundering division
Edit: I recommend this really well-written article covering [Tether]( - it's mentioned in there, but the risk of government seizure of their assets is a pretty likely outcome of publicizing what banks they use, regardless of whether they're running fractional reserve banking
Edit 2: Looks like my presumption that the [US government is interested in Tether's assets was correct](

You might have recalled that the partnership was dissolved - has it occurred to you that it was dissolved because Tether would show them assets, but refused to show the location of them (which of course would make the audit worthless, but would protect the location of Tether's USD assets)?
The US government without a doubt would loooooooove to seize Tether's USD, and under their interpretation of money laundering laws that would completely fit in with their philosophy. Tether can allow individuals to move huge sums of USD without AML/KYC checks or banks, and I imagine they must be furious about it.
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:19:14
It wouldn't be a very good tool for money laundering as the transaction ledger is not anonymous, and it can be followed in exactly the way that Bitcoin can be followed - and it really wouldn't be any different from using USD to buy Bitcoin and move it, and sell it for USD on the other end. So I think only stupid criminals would be using it instead of something like Monero.
Having said that though - I'm certain the government does see it as non-compliant with AML/KYC laws, and they're definitely going to want it shut down.
If all that happens is they hit them with fines and tell them to shore up their KYC/AML and be more open on audits I'd be amazed

Money can be moved to avoid the seizure, so I'm not sure what point you're making there


I think you're agreeing with me on the point that Tether is going to conceal their fund locations no matter what because if they're not fractional reserving then they're avoiding asset seizure, and if they're fractional reserving, then they're avoiding publicly admitting it - but I can't tell if you're being sarcastic and don't think they need to hide their assets from the US government

You didn't actually disagree, because what they said was 'it's likely their software was rapidly assembled'. You then claimed that was inexcusable... which isn't disagreeing with them. All they said was that the software was rapidly assembled, they didn't say that was okay or a good decision. They also discussed why fast is sometimes better and slow is sometimes better.

You also need to consider that if a large, wealthy entity wants to arbitrage between any exchanges that use USDT pairs without USD pairs, they need to send money as USDT to those exchanges to take advantage of the disparity between them and other people who aren't large enough to buy Tether at the corporate level (which are the only people that can apparently buy Tether right now).
This fundamentally allows them to take advantage of an arbitration pathway that isn't available to others, meaning it has consistent profit potential; anytime there's a price advantage in USD or USDT, they can use it

You've seen this quote before, right?


- Giancarlo Devasini, Bitfinex Chief Financial Officer and shareholder of Tether during a verbal conversation regarding Tethers.
I'm under the impression here that the banks and government aren't closing their accounts because Tether / Bitfinex are concealing the fact that they're Tether / Bitfinex through the use of shell companies, etc. The USD isn't exactly required to move very much once Tether obtains it, so there's not a lot of suspicious activities for any banks being used by Tether to see... as long as they don't go publicly identifying accounts they've used which would link the money to them.

No, people hate banks because they hold excessive power in the relationship between the public vs. banks.
Banks can of course serve a purpose, even a valid and useful purpose in relation to cryptocurrencies and the future of money - but up until now, they had no competition; they definitely didn't compete with each other, and colluded in escalating games of increasing the friction between people and the money they owned... instead of acting as useful facilitators.
The reality of cryptocurrencies is that banks are going to be forced them to become more competitive. Unlike cash, crypto will be able to operate without them as it flourishes. If they start to behave competitively again and serve customers instead of holding them hostage, then perhaps after that they'll have earned a benign reputation. But right now? Banks deserve the hate they get. It has little to do with 'profiting off my money when I'm not using it' and everything to do with abusing their lack of competition to enrich themselves at the expense of their clients who sit in a position with no leverage.
Just as an easy and obvious-as-fuck example: if you can seriously look at their prior practice (before it was outlawed) of intentionally re-ordering the chronological times of transactions to maximize overdraft fees, and the way that a large number of banks participated in the practice effectively making it impossible to escape, and you can say "yeah that's ok!" then you're fucking delusional

I'm not affiliated with Shapeshift, but it's my understanding that 'Quick' accepts slippage as a possibility, and will do market orders to fill it quickly. If the market's thin, that means your order could experience significant slippage
Precise on the other hand offers you what they think the market can bear at an exact exchange rate, but if the market moves against your position (would have experienced negative slippage), the trade sits as a limit order waiting to be filled, to give you the agreed price. It will time out after long enough, but if the market is thin or moves against you, it will not fill, and could sit for a while
I like shapeshift, but I recommend using Quick - if a limit order is really required, I recommend getting on a traditional exchange instead. This can be much worse for coins with thin liquidity

Just gonna throw this out, but you're ascribed an emotional response that comes from the environment that is trying to discuss here. It's factual to say 'are all fields that are male-dominated' but when you said 'are all fields that women find less interesting' you're talking about the emotional response of an entire gender (which is hard to measure by itself), and you're also not considering that emotional response might be different if the environment of these male-dominated fields was different
Separately of the way that statement claims knowledge on something that's impossible to measure, I know you yourself have to have to have been hit with this type of shit at some point in your life outside of the fields you're talking about - everyone gets it sometime even if they don't always recognize it. Shitty things like: You like country music and you drive a truck, so what are you doing trying to be a lawyer? You're black and driving a nice car, what are you doing in this nice neighborhood? You're white and have a penis, what could you possibly understand about discrimination? You're young. You're old. You're female. You're not from around here. You're a non-believer.
Is it that hard to believe that women get hit with 'what could you know about X?' in these fields until they don't want to deal with it anymore? I watch it happen so often it blows my mind

This is likely different from their old solution that had Coinbase as the custodian, and may not suit CheapAir's needs anymore.
Effectively this is removing the burden of KYC responsibilities from the exchange (Coinbase) and shifting it to the vendors. The vendors can deal with whoever they want without Coinbase being liable. If funds that authorities are tracking pass through the vendor to Coinbase, Coinbase can point back to the vendor and say 1-2-3 not it

You're right on those points, but it misses a few key features that bitcoin provides:
* Automatically verifies itself as authentic, no expert verification needed, making selling/buying a much simpler affair
* Although scams and "bitcoin mistakes" can cause loss, it cannot be counterfeited
* The physical space requirements for storage are negligible by comparison
* Transmission of wealth scales vastly without major requirements in transportation, transportation security, cross-border complications
* Easier to conceal and secure for less-wealthy individuals; cost of security is knowledge and best-practices as opposed to payment for provided security services (guards/vaults/insurance)
There are downsides unique to blockchain!
* Easy transmission mentioned above makes it an incredibly attractive target for theft
* Possibility for non-violent theft that doesn't require physical onsite presence makes it even more attractive for theft
* Ongoing security race provided by 'miners' is a fascinating but fairly new innovation (in terms of humanity) that might experience risks as technology and crypto evolves
* Bad practices from poor understanding can cause devastating losses whereas physical metals as storage of value have very obvious methods of preventing loss
* Fungibility of bitcoin is sometimes questionable, but this issue may be solved by future upgrades to the protocol (SegWit can give a path to improvements for this)
* Privacy based fungibility advancements can also assist in money-laundering, which while I am annoyed by government meddling in money transmission, is still an important avenue for attacking some harmful criminal enterprises (weapons dealing, terrorism, other large-scale organized crime) *I should note that while I recognize this as a downside, it's one that I absolutely would embrace and simply tell government to find new and better ways to attack crime*
* Relies on the existence of the Internet - in some extreme scenarios (societal failure) this could be a downfall
... I'm sure there's more downsides, but you can see the vast differences between physical store of value vs. this incredible new invention

Just think: You're a small-time but wealthy independent miner. 50,000 btc holding, 2% of the pool's worth of hashpower. Time to make some money.
Make an exchange for as much of your assets as possible trade out from btc to fiat, or another crypto like Eth or Monero. If you have the capability to take out huge shorts on btc, do it too.
Attack the network, do everything you can to crash the price. Once the price is suppressed, cash in the shorts, buy back your 50,000 btc (or more) with fiat/other crypto (which may have even enjoyed a price spike beyond the one you created yourself, due *to* the price spike you created and to the disruption to btc), and stop the attack.
Wait for the price to recover, enjoy your profits. This is something that gets done in situations where something of value can be disrupted by unscrupulous people, and is not even remotely a special situation that applies to btc only.

To be fair the concept of precious metals as money has never had a concept such as blockchain to compete with until now - almost all other materials-as-money concepts had the same features. Blockchain by comparison has some tremendous differences that make it a whole new product in the realm of privately-held internationally recognized store of wealth, and it really could replace it for that specific space ����

I think Monero actually came from a *reset* of a pre-mined currency... I think Dash claimed to have 'accidentally' mined too fast at the start.
I really dig both bitcoin and Monero though - eth is really trying to do more than currency, so I do see the possibilities there. If bitcoin adopts SegWit and solves fungibility concerns using SegWit features, Monero will lose it's currently excellent fungibility edge.

Just to reiterate, the scenario above isn't speculative, it's very simple: **if you can influence the price of something intentionally in a way that other people won't know the timing, you can profit from it at the expense of others.** Period.
You don't even need any of the things I mention above to do these things, and the example I provided was only specific to make you understand that you must assume that bitcoin will be attacked the the purpose of gain. If it isn't clear to you, it can be attacked by people who have no intention of even buying, shorting, or mining; perhaps they want a rival cryptocurrency to take the  position, or they're attacking a company or person with btc-centric assets, perhaps they're the Joker. There's plenty of reasons.
**The core concept is that you cannot assume no bad actors, because the ability to arbitrarily influence the value of btc will automatically invite it.** Which is what was marveling at - that people kept discussing this as though someone wouldn't do it because the people discussing it couldn't figure out how the malicious players would profit off of it.

When people refer to 'paper' wallets, they're generally referring to offline wallets much like you're discussing (which sometimes includes paper). When people discuss these regardless of the offline storage method, they also discuss and recommend using multi-signature configurations (such as 3 keys / 2 of 3 required to rebuild the private key) with the portion keys kept in separate / secured locations to avoid things such as fire vulnerability you mention.
Using an offline computer is also acceptable, but I hope you're also keeping more than one offline copy of your private key (whether digital or paper) because unfortunately your offline computer can also easily be destroyed in a home fire.
A great offline-wallet safety protocol document was linked a while ago here in that discusses high-resilience storage of bitcoin using offline computers, physical dice-generated private keys, multi-sig key protection strategies, and so on - it's worth a read, and you can then pick and choose the tactics that you feel are worth your time: [Glacier Protocol](

The reason you don't have LN right now is because BU has blocked SegWit deployment for months and months. It could have been in use already.
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:35:09
Pro tip: the SegWit change doesn't need a hardfork and so it doesn't need to be rolled in with a 2MB block size. The 2MB block size can be put in it's own hardfork, and *should* be from a programming perspective - SegWit should be allowed to roll out on the soft fork *no matter where the block size is going* as that's simply the cleaner way to implement both changes. More importantly, trying to roll them together would unnecessarily delay SegWit activation; hard forks always include a generous waiting period to ensure the network is in step and ready, but SegWit is ready to soft fork on a much shorter window.
Yep, you can do both. It's important to note however that adopting SegWit has nothing to do with whether the block size is bumped to 2MB - so once again, just to be clear, this isn't a debate about one vs. the other, SegWit has nothing to do with your desire for a 2MB hard fork, and miners are attacking the network to prevent SegWit because they think it will benefit them.
It will not. This isn't about "compromise" because SegWit has fuck-all to do with decisions to change the block size - BU attempts (successfully) to frame it as a "scaling debate", but the only debate is Increase Blocksize vs. Don't Increase Blocksize and **SegWit has fucking nothing to do with that**.
SegWit doesn't lock the block size, it doesn't make a statement that the block size shouldn't change, and supporting it doesn't mean you don't support the idea of larger blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:19:47
Did you think you didn't have working LN because they stopped developing it? They have it working, now. The reason you can't use it is SegWit is being blocked by miners refusing to signal for the upgrade for many months now.
You could have been enjoying the benefits of LN by now, but instead it's being withheld by miners. Even if you want bigger blocks (I wouldn't mind), SegWit doesn't prevent implementing that - miners are blocking SegWit because they think they can force implementation of their self-beneficial demands by holding the network hostage.

If Core developers did so, it still wouldn't be accepted by the miners - if Core put in 2MB, BU developers would say they needed 8MB. If Core put in 8MB, BU would say they need Emergent Consensus - if Core put in EC, BU would say it wasn't emerge-y enough.
It's not about the block size. Compromise isn't possible because they aren't interested in compromise, they're interested in commit access and taking control of the primarily-used branch of current code. BU wants the control, and the miners are siding with them because they think it will be profitable.
Unfortunately for both BU and miners, their desires are completely irrelevant. If they do something the people actually *using* bitcoin don't agree with, those people will simply withdrawl their money from the bitcoin ecosystem and move it to other currencies. We're seeing this now: bitcoin dominance is at an all-time low. The market cap for Ethereum has grown considerably, the price is stable, and it already has features that bitcoin is planning to implement later. Bitcoin only has first-to-market advantage, and that advantage is evaporating.
Whether miners like it or not, the power doesn't lie with them. It lies with the users of the currency, and they're attacking them with spam transactions, mining empty blocks, and refusing to upgrade the network. Users will just leave for currencies they're not attacking. Users do not care about miner politics. They care about their money not being attacked.

Eh, when I discuss 'paper' wallets with friends, we generally refer to offline mechanisms as 'paper' regardless of the actual medium... but sure, I could see your point.
Harddrives are not resilient to fire, at all. Heat affects the magnetism used to store data in standard harddrives and if the fire's hot enough can melt the substrate material the data is written to. In the case of flash memory devices, they will melt outright. Your drive and all data on it can easily be destroyed in a house fire, period.
Harddrives also fail regularly. They have an intended lifespan (Mean Time Between Failure), and they cannot last forever.
If you have only one copy of your private key in any single physical location, or on a single physical drive, you are running a serious risk of it's destruction.

*"Holding this point alone will strangle the development of layer 2 protocols, preventing transaction fee revenue being spread to outside of the mining community."*
I'd like to point out how stupid this thought is. This is the logic that they are deploying, but it completely ignores the fact that users of the currency can simply... use a different currency that these miners don't have control over. They're not preventing transaction fees from moving. Those fees will go where they want to go, and they are destroying their own revenue stream.

This isn't to reply to dispute that people aren't playing network-spamming games to try and make money (I'm certain they are):
If they were doing that, doesn't the existence of the transaction need to be announced in the mempool to cause others to try and post higher fees to 'beat' their transaction?
@_date: 2017-08-30 10:57:02
I... don't think you've thought this through.
If they weren't relying on announcing the transaction to force others to pay more in fees, that means they would only be taking up their own capacity. Yes, that reduces the overall network capacity, which would increase congestion - correct. Except if that's what they're going to do... they just wouldn't mine transactions under X threshold of fee cost. There's no need for them to mine their own transactions, that cannot be mined by anyone else, that nobody else knows about, which can only consume capacity within their own blocks. They can just *not mine transactions* instead.
@_date: 2017-01-21 00:53:17
The troll is you
@_date: 2017-08-30 08:56:11
Again... doing that doesn't announce the transaction exists to others, so they wouldn't transmit their transactions with a higher fee to receive a higher priority. If a miner was holding 1MB of 1 million sat/byte transactions in secret, it doesn't matter whether they publish them or not, nobody else is going to adjust their fees upwards to compete because *nobody knows they exist.*

Use a X out of Y multi-sig encryption on a text file that contains your seed password. An *example* (I stress example because I'm sure someone will come in and criticize it) scheme would be to do a 2-of-3 multisig arrangement, store one key at your house, one key in well-secured cloud storage, and one key at the bank in a safe deposit box. If any one of those is lost, the other two can recover the full seed. If a single one of those is stolen, it cannot be used without at least one of the other two. Hopefully you'd notice the theft of a single key and immediately transfer funds out.
You can also keep more than one copy of each of the above; so for example you might actually have two copies of the 'house' key above, one at your place and one with a signatory (will executor or otherwise?). It's important to note this would still be only three keys total, 2-of-3, just with an additional physical location of say Key 1 (House) to protect against flood, fire, city-wide disaster. This would not be a 2-of-4 scheme, although if you feel like a 2-of-4 would serve your purposes you could attempt that too. 3-of-5, 5-of-7, you can pick whatever combination fits your potential storage locations and safety levels you need.
It's important to remember that if others know of your key storage locations and the locations are not legitimately secured locations (banks, etc.) enough money being stored could put the locations at risk. A 2-of-4 with one key at your house and one key at a relative's could invite those two locations to have home invasions, because they are *not banks and are not hard targets*. Keeping a key on an easily accessible cloud-storage and one in your home safe just invites someone to break in and steal your laptop+safe and coerce you to login.
There's a great PDF document that details lots of levels of security for your funds that you can find here:  They discuss a lot of security for managing paper wallets with extreme paranoia, but many of the techniques can be adopted to securing backups of hardware wallet seeds, and you'll probably get some great ideas for extra enhancements that you feel you could work into your security model.

Hello - to actually answer your question, if you're interested in watching your money grow, the real answer is that most people investing in bitcoin are taking advantage of bitcoin's deflationary nature to grow their income vs. the equivalent in fiat money (ex. US dollars) or goods.
Only 21 million bitcoin will be created when the creation process is complete - as more and more people come to use bitcoin and more money enters the bitcoin market, more bitcoin isn't made to accommodate them, rather each bitcoin becomes more valuable. If you take a look at sites such as [CoinCap.io]( you can see there's under 17 million bitcoin at the moment, and the "market cap" of bitcoin gives a rough idea of how much fiat money exists within that ~16mil of bitcoins, which is about $21 billion as of this writing.
If bitcoin spiked in popularity today and brought in double it's current market cap worth of money into the market, the price of the bitcoins would double from the current ~$1320 to $2660, for instance. Because the current market cap of ~$21 billion is a tiny water drop in the global economy, it's thought by a lot of people that bitcoin can potentially escalate wildly in value if it's adopted by the population.
The above is how most people are counting on bitcoin to grow in value - in regards to growing the literal amount of bitcoin you have through interest, to do so you'd need to put it in a position to be lent or borrowed to others (which is what bank accounts do with your money in the background). Two exchanges, [Bitfinex]( and [Poloniex]( both have the ability to loan your bitcoin to the market to make interest on the loan, however both have minimum amounts to do so (about $50 in the case of Bitfinex for instance), and currently both exchanges have also been unable to send money in USD out to banks which is causing some unusual prices on those exchanges and less active trading. *Exchanges also carry risk that bank accounts do not have.* The bitcoins must be held by the exchanges (not you), and these exchanges are not liable for the loss of your money, even if it's their fault. Exchanges *have* been compromised in the past, and if you don't place strong passwords and good security practice on your exchange account and associated email address, you can lose your money without the exchange even being compromised.
Hope this helps!

Not quite... what you did is often attempted as a scam. What people would do is buy bitcoin with a credit card, then tell credit card company 'it totally wasn't me. cancel this!'
You needed to cancel the transaction through Coinbase, not your bank - it's likely that the bitcoin will be frozen by Coinbase and your account won't be usable until you sort it out with them, and that's going to be difficult.

The definition of a web wallet is one where the private keys are stored on the remote server. Jaxx is an application where source is available, but not in an easily compile-able format - but it keeps the keys only on the local device, and nowhere else. The two things don't mean the same thing.
Additionally, the entire issue they have revolves around the fact that it failed to calculate a correct fee - an issue completely unrelated to "someone stole all muh moneyz" (your words). Learn what the fuck you're talking about before you rip into someone, and also maybe fucking read

I'll say most of the time, yes. In the power vacuum another dictator inevitably tries to rise. However, if no form of democratic input is accepted, are there any other choices to change the government?
While sometimes a government improvement has come from overthrowing dictators, I can't recall instances where not overthrowing dictators resulted in the government moving towards democratic administration and improvement.

An example of contracts on the network that have a use right now:
They've created a 'domain name' system on the network where users can bid for Ethereum domain names (.eth) they would like to use. These can be set to represent payment addresses to make it easier to send money; example: username.exchange.eth could be your exchange funds address, and the exchange.eth domain could be bought and run by your favorite exchange.
The entire system is decentralized, relies on no central servers, and executes entirely on the Ethereum network through smart contracts. I can check if a domain name is reserved, start the auction, make my bid (concealed), the bidding period ends it and it's revealed I've won, I can claim it and then control it through the Ethereum network. I've already purchased some for my personal use, and it took some reading to make sure I was doing it right since it's all so new, but it was surprisingly simple.
The fee to actually send *just money* across Ethereum is negligible; I sent a few thousand yesterday for half a cent, and it was in a block gaining confirmations in less than two minutes. The amount of mining hashpower in the Ethereum network is now on par with bitcoin per the [adjusted Köppelmann Constant metric]( developers and programmers are bringing some great development, and the Eth network is likely to see lightning implementation soon. Ethereum is already handling more than 50% of bitcoin's traffic level, and it's doing it with faster confirmation times than the fastest confirmation times offered by bitcoin.
Regarding proof of stake (not mentioned in your post, but mentioned in others), I'm of the opinion that if PoS works that's great, but I think it would be a while before they can have a working model; their original timelines were optimistic. It's also very clear that if they can't get a working model going, proof-of-work will stay as long as it's needed, so I'm not certain why people think they can point to proof-of-stake as a flaw.
All of the above being said, there's no reason you can't be using both bitcoin and eth currencies. I recommend eth because out of any of the smart-contract currencies out there, it's the one with the most hashpower, development support, market cap stability, and acceptance rate. Keep all the BTC you want, but hop on that Eth train too.

It wouldn't be possible for me to personally know the future. Since they'd never done it before, creating a contract to re-route TheDAO funds back to shareholder hands probably seemed reasonable at the time. I think given how contentious it turned out to be that they wouldn't choose to do that again.
Something you may not be aware of is they didn't revert any transactions. They placed a state change to take place at a specific block in the future that would put a contract in place that sent the stolen funds (and only the stolen funds) back to a store where they could be claimed by original owners.
No transactions were reverted and nothing outside of attacked funds were affected. Given that the network was chugging along nicely, that doesn't seem terrible to me, but I understand those who would oppose it under the idea that they might choose to do it again in the future.
They also made this state change (and the fork) optional with a switch in the program that could be used, opting out if you disagreed with it. I believe they thought it was going to go 90/10 one way or the other and they'd run with public opinion, but it ended up going close to even. They chose to continue on the modified fork and most economic support *eventually* moved with them. They also didn't plan well for the idea of replay attacks or accidentally sending funds on both chains, probably for that same reason - they probably thought it was going to go big in one direction or the other.
I can't speak for them, but given the dire reaction to the split I'm guessing they know better than to get involved in modifying the blockchain state in the future. If they didn't learn from that experience, it wouldn't be a difficult proposition to leave Ethereum for other currencies.

I'll make some recommendations here, but I understand if some of these recommendations might not fit your budget - also, sorry for the wall of text, trying to hopefully be informative:
 a hardware wallet - I recommend a [Ledger Nano S]( although many recommend the Trezor and KeepKey products also.
**Reason:** Hardware wallets work by keeping the private keys for your wallet inside the device in a secure 'sandbox'. When you want to send money, the amounts and where you're sending are sent into the sandbox, and the hardware wallet asks on the wallet screen if the address and amount is correct - when you press the button to say yes, it sends a signed transaction back out; it *never* sends the private keys out from the wallet. The safety level is *very* strong here. The only attack that I'm aware of is a virus attempting to substitute the address and amount sent to the wallet - this should be seen by you on the wallet screen, and then denied by you when you see it's not the right address. This security measure is easy to use, and because it's easy people *actually use it.* I can't recommend one of these enough. Someday this is going to be integrated into your phones!
**Downside:** The Ledger Nano S costs a little under $100 at the moment primarily due to the shipping costs from France, and demand is incredibly high and projected ship times are in September at the moment. If you're holding more than $500 though, spending $100 to have a long-term high-quality security measure is an easy decision, so consider the future value.
 a 'seed phrase' storage item - I recommend a [Cryptosteel Mnemonic]( although you can also opt to print your words on [special high-quality paper]( and try to protect it against fire and theft.
**Reason:** Trezor, Ledger Nano S, etc. all use 'backup phrase' style backups based on the BIP39 standard. These backup phrases are standard and can be recovered into software wallets, other hardware wallets, even webwallets, and so they're highly recoverable even if the hardware is lost, damaged, stolen, you forget your PIN, etc. Your objective will be to keep a physical copy of this backup phrase text safe. This is the mechanism you can use to recover if your home is hit by disaster, robbery, etc. Because this backup phrase is physical, this keeps your private keys out of computers where they could be stolen or copied.
**Downside:** A seed phrase can be *physically* stolen and used by anyone, and it's important to understand that keeping this phrase somewhere with $100k of crypto on it is the equivalent of keeping a literal stack of cash where you have the seed stored. Would you put 100k in a safety deposit box at a bank? Seems ok to me. Would you keep 100k in your nightstand next to your bed, when people know you own crypto? Would you send 100k to your parents home and put them at risk? *Not a good idea by comparison.* There are measures you can take to prevent this from being an issue however! See the next important step.
 when setting up the hardware wallet, immediately research and use the special feature that allows you to create a **second** wallet from your BIP39 seed mentioned above by combining it with a password.
**Reason:** In the case of the Ledger Nano S, you can set it up to have two PINs, and it would have one wallet from just your BIP39 seed, and a second wallet generated from your BIP39 seed with a password you provide. Again this is a standardized system and can be recovered from other hardware/software wallets, but the key here is that you never write this password down; I recommend keeping it simple. Someone would now need both your BIP39 seed, and your only-in-your-brain password to actually get at your big pile of cash. This makes it much safer to hand a copy of the BIP39 seed over to your parents for safekeeping for instance. They also recommend using the clear version of the wallet as a hot-wallet for small amounts, and treating the password version of the wallet like a savings account - the big stuff goes there. It's a good policy.
**Downside:** This password really has to be kept in your head, if you've written it somewhere or it's on your computer, someone who knows your security can just steal them both. When using your Ledger, you'll be typing in a second pin for ease of use, but you usually won't be typing in the password (that is also an option but typing it out on two buttons takes a good bit of time). If you forget this password, that money will be gone. Don't forget it. Keep the password simple and memorable.
Those three particular points should give you amazing security and good resiliency, but I understand that it would take a long time for the hardware to show up, and it might also be too pricy for how much you want to save/hodl in crypto. So to actually try and answer your *original* question regarding the USB keys:
* You'd need to make sure that all these USB key copies of your wallet are encrypted or password-protected in some way. If someone physically takes a USB stick that has no password protection on the wallet, the money is gone.
* Understand that if your personal system does get malicious software, there is a lot of software out there designed specifically to find wallet files and copy them while logging your keystrokes to also try finding any passwords you might be using to encrypt those wallets. If you happen to open the wallet on a system that is compromised, the malware can copy the wallet file, and watch for passwords being typed. Just a little bit of malware, and the money could be gone.
* USB keys can fail - consider having your backup copies instead as paper-copy of BIP39 keys at the locations you were thinking of, **preferably with the additional password mentioned above.** This would eliminate the possibility of a digital memory failure. Super important note: even though the Ledger Nano S supports the BIP39 key and you could import it into your Ledger when it arrives, don't import any self-generated keys into it - those private keys touched networked computers, and so in the security sense you and I shouldn't "trust" those. Fresh new BIP39 key when the Ledger arrives!
* If you keep using cloud storage for your wallet, I don't fault you - after all, some obscure crypto coins might not yet have hardware wallet support, and you don't want to lose those keys to a computer failure. But if you're going to be using cloud storage in any way, make sure the wallet file itself has a separate password on it to help make the file useless if attackers breach your email and cloud storage.
* If you weren't using special number-generating 2FA from Google authenticator, it's time to start using it. Ensure it is tied to your primary emails that password resets get sent to, to your cloud storage, and to your exchange accounts! Those three are the nastiest attack vectors. Also know and understand that Google 2FA is tied to your phone - losing or destroying your phone means you'll have to talk to and likely prove you're you to all of those companies. When upgrading phones, you must remember to stop and remove 2FA from all your services before the switch! Text-message verification can easily be redirected by attackers, and it's important to get this SMS-based 2FA off as many of your accounts as possible.
* Keep your phone number and primary email that password resets might send to as secret as you can; scammers attempt to get you to reveal phone numbers and emails if you frequent crypto-friendly forums, subreddits, etc. so that they can perform the phone-number porting attack I mentioned. Consider maybe using a Google Voice number for your general public use!

That's the key part - the exchange now has to either confirm 'oh this wasn't part of a transaction, here's the money back' or 'it was for this specific thing here, we're keeping it'. Since we're talking a hypothetical here and not the OPs exact situation, the prompting here is to **force** an ostensibly real-but-lazily-run exchange to answer and return the money.
What I say above doesn't apply if the exchange is fraudulent or outside of legal jurisdictions - but the conversation running up to this was about how a system like this could legally resolve disputes for blockchain transactions; my reply was specifically about how this hypothetical is *not* like handing cash over, because there's a ledger and a provable way to demonstrate who sent the money.
If the hypothetical exchange were fraudulent and decides they're going to falsely claim the money was for a specific thing, they'd have to then back it up with an explanation of why it was sent to a cold wallet address and not a customer deposit address, prove that the money was credited to the customer's account and subsequently used, etc. That's a lot of effort to intentionally commit fraud, and the risk of having to refund the money, pay the legal fees of the plaintiff, and then potentially fines for the fraud part all make the prospect of committing this fraud risky and unattractive if the exchange is subject to a working legal system.
For the OPs case though, they likely don't have any legal power, so the exchange will likely ignore them regardless of whether it was simple laziness or fraud

Hi. A few questions for you:
* Your password is not brute-forceable, that's great.
* Does the cloud service has a password reset function? Most services do, except for the services where you control the private keys used for encryption (Spideroak offers this as an example, but Dropbox by comparison does not).
* This password reset function is usually tied to some form of 2FA. Do you already know the exact requirements of the 2FA for this cloud service needed to reset your password? Is it just an email to your email account? A text to your phone number? An email and text? A Google 2FA? Authy 2FA?
* If email is involved in the password reset process, what form of 2FA is needed to reset the password on your email? Is it just another email to a different email account? A text to your phone number? An email and text? A Google 2FA? Authy 2FA?
* With your email password reset process taken into consideration, consider your phone - do you have any protections in place against the porting of your phone number? Possible protections against this would include a Google auth 2FA (tied to device only), or Authy 2FA **specifically with multi-device turned off**.
* Next, is the wallet on the cloud storage encrypted itself with a password independent of the cloud storage password, that is also not stored in any of your password managers or cloud storage?
Having asked the above, it's not necessary for you to answer those, but I hope the following will be informative for people in general reading: hackers don't brute force passwords. **They contact your phone provider, posing as you, get them to port your phone number to a SIM they hold with a few pieces of trivial, easy-to-obtain information, and then they proceed to:**
* Sync any Authy 2FA keys if you left multi-device enabled,
* Reset your primary email account password to lock you out,
* Reset the passwords to any cloud storage accounts they can find tied to the email,
* Reset the passwords to any crypto exchanges or online wallet services they can find associated accounts for,
* then fucking ruin your life.
You might already be following good practices, and so this might not apply to you. But if your phone number isn't locked down and secret, and if you're not using specific-device non-cloud-synced 2FA all over the fucking place, you have **zero protection** and an attacker could annihilate you with just your real name and phone number.
@_date: 2019-05-22 08:48:50


Shouldn't they have proof in the form of the private keys they sent the transaction from? Can't they sign a message to prove they control that key, and then the counter party would have to explain why they have that money when the person who provably sent it claims they made an error?
