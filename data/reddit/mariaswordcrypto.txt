Well, we can. Instead on focusing on the consumption we should focus on the sources. \~70% comes from renewable energy sources. Renewable sources are intermittent and in excess, so rather you waste this resources or you reuse them as a source of value, mining cryptos. Moreover waste is also a huge source of energy, don't you think it's better to invest in waste to energy sources to make this system safe instead of landfilling?
I do think that mining can be seen as a way to save energy that would otherwise been wasted.

100x of people? And What about 2 billion people unbanked and controlled by autoritarian governments around the world? Where they have instead a phone and an internet access? 
This is a typical western-country-i phonex- kind of answer.
Cryptocurrencies are helping incredibly countries killed by hyperinflaction like Venezuela, Turkey etc.
Moreover you need to think about the sources when you talk about energy consumption. Using the excess of energy (sun, wind etc.) or using waste to mine makes the bitcoin an environmental subsidy to alternative energy all around the world.

The current global power consumption for the servers that run bitcoin’s software is a minimum of 
**2.55 gigawatts (GW)**, which amounts to energy consumption of **22 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year**—almost the same as Ireland. Google, by comparison, used **5.7 TWh worldwide in 2015**.
*PWC - Bitcoin’ Growing Energy Problem, Alex de Vries – Joule, 2018*
**Therefore, considering an average data centres consumption of  approximately 2000 TWh yearly, bitcoin mining consumes less that the 0.0365%.** 
Contrary to popular belief, the majority of the bitcoin mining network is fuelled by renewable energy. As much as 75% of the network is run on cheap renewable electricity, mainly hydropower.

thanks for your reply. 
"I heard Bitcoin mining in China predominately uses electricity generated through fossil fuels" he types confidently into a tweet, and presses send. He then slowly leans over to turn on his 550W subwoofer and 65' TV to watch a documentary on Netflix on soybeans.

I will add my opinion, as renewable energy analyst:
Instead on focusing on the consumption we should focus on the sources of energy for BTC mining. Renewable sources are intermittent and produced in excess. TSO and DSo have a lot of difficulties in matching demand and supply. You have to options: you waste this energy or you use it for other scopes, like creating a new secure system to exchange. Moreover, among the best renewable sources to produce electricity there is waste, that is increasing and harming the planet more than anything else.
