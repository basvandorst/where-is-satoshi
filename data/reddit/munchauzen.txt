I ate the DOGE Burger. Well, three of them actually. It cost me Ð144,000 in 2014, which is currently worth $1330.

I've actaully never even seen a BTC tip and wasn't even aware that a BTC tipbot even existed until yesterday when I listened to the lets talk bitcoin podcast where they interviewed the creator of the dogetipbot... and I've been mining doge for over 2 months now, and subbed to since early December 2013.

What you said is the definition of a straw man argument and is by no means a legitimate response.
