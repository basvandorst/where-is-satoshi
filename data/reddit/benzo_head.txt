I honestly think that after the 2024 halving we will start calculating the price of satoshis vs dollars more frequently.
Take as an example gold, nobody measures the price of gold in kilograms (roughly 50k) we use ounces to measure the price of gold ($1500). I think something similar will happen and people will talk less about Bitcoin as a single unit.

Why are people so bearish?
Everyone on tradingview is posting charts with meme lines saying we're going to dump more even to $3000, but honestly we dropped quite a bit already (roughly 40%) and we're approaching the halving so...

Is anybody actually hyped about the halving? We're only 6 months away
For the first time in Bitcoin's history its inflation will be lower than the US dollar. Although price-wise *maybe* the 2016 halving was more important because the decrease in inflation was way higher than the next halving.
IMO we'll have thrilling times ahead
@_date: 2019-10-13 08:22:40
Yeah moving averages are one of the few indicators that are actually useful.
Bitcoin started climbing after the 50 MA crossed the 100 MA back in mid 2016. What we're going through now is very similar to the the beginning of 2016. While the 200 MA held as a support back in 2015 and the end of 2018. The anticipation of the halving usually occurs a couple of months prior.
This is what I made playing with meme lines:

Honestly even the stock market to a certain extent is based on the "greater fool theory". Nobody cares about the underlying aspects of a company or the progress it makes, it's just profits and the only way to get those is by selling your bags to another fool.
Atleast Bitcoin has some ideology behind it, stocks are just stocks...

It honestly didn't make sense in the first place that VISA, PayPal and Mastercard were supporting a "new" payment system that makes them obsolete.

I wouldn't even be suprised if they're holding until the halving. 
It would honestly make sense if you take in consideration that Unicef doens't "need" the money anyways since it receives roughly 4-5 billion dollars per year in aid by governments and different private sectors

I wouldn't be too surprised if we go sideways for quite a while, I'm thinking mid November - December.
BAKKT might take months for it to catch up in terms of volume (if ever) but I really doubt it will be "important" for Bitcoin whether it succeeds or not
@_date: 2019-10-12 07:51:00
I really feel that we’ll breakout soon and form an inverse bart back to the 10-11k range.
No idea when, but it can happen real quick. Before November would make sense considering we’re only 6 months and a half away from the halving™️
@_date: 2019-10-26 09:45:32
“Inevitable” is such a meaningless word in this market
Nobody knows anything, it might pump to 12k within the next couple of days
@_date: 2019-10-12 11:46:52
Waaaay too low dude, take in consideration Bitcoin already dropped roughly 40% from the end of June. 
IMO there's very little chance Bitcoin will retest 5k let alone lower levels. It's holding up on the 200 MA and I'm sure people will anticipate the halving starting from November-December
We'll see though, nothing makes sense
@_date: 2019-10-04 09:18:01
Yeah we're all down 90%...Bitcoin is officially DEAD, this time it's different haha

Boomer mentality, the great majority don’t hold stocks because of dividends lmao
Nobody cares about 2-3% dividends especially if the stock could lose half of its value in a year, dividends are “exciting” and thrilling as the bond market

I didn’t criticize the stock market per se, I’ve been investing in pharma companies for years.
It’s undeniable that the stock market and to a greater extent crypto is still driven by the greater fool theory. Denying it, is simply cognitive dissonance
@_date: 2019-10-04 09:58:22
Not really a crash but I do think we could retest mid 7k before November. 
That's just my opinion though, hope to be proven wrong
@_date: 2019-10-13 08:39:23
Honestly, you should be the one taking THIS decision. For the rest you need to do in depth research or ask questions if you don't understand specific technical aspects.
Bitcoin is NOT a get rich quick scheme. There's no guarantee that Bitcoin will continue climbing, but due to it's inherent structure (halvings and hard cap supply) along with the fact that it's a digital, immutable, decentralized, deflationary currency it's *likely* that it will continue having a bright future.

14k to 7k is more than a correction
@_date: 2019-12-04 08:14:42
The sentiment is bearish af, people on tradingview are posting meme charts calling for lower lows despite this 50% drop. This leads me to believe this is somewhat the bottom.
We’ve been on a downtrend for the last 5 months and the halving is a couple of months away...I’m not fucking selling to whales

Makes no sense because the 2024 halving will only decrease inflation from 1.8% to 0.9% while the halving of 2028 will decrease it to 0.45%. 
The next two halvings won’t impact the price much more since Bitcoin has reached a considerable market cap. 
The reason it skyrocketed in 2013 and 2017 was because the previous halvings had a decisive impact on lowering inflation, the one of 2020 will probably be the last then you can expect gold-silver type of gains.
Also for Bitcoin to reach those levels it should have a 50 Trilion market cap this is pure hopium

It slightly "corrected" at the end of January. 
From the charts it seems it's aiming for a double top, I honestly wouldn't touch the SP500 with a 10 foot pole right now
