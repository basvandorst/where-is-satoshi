Just got off the phone with another coinbase rep (not a woman like the first time, who was absolutely CLUELESS), and they stated that it should not be showing 0 available balance, especially for the BTC wallet since it was instant purchased using my Cash wallet on coinbase. They have adviced me to send a support ticket now which is what I will be doing. The stupid part about all of this is that I'm missing out on these hard dips and could potentially lose a lot of profit depending on how long it takes to fix this. Absolutely ridiculous. If anyone had this problem before or potentially could suggest a fix, please let me know. Cheers.

I have $8.8k currently "cash (USD)" on my coinbase account and I decided I wanted to trade for my first time today on the GDAX platform, but for whatever reason, when I try to deposit money from my "Cash (USD) Wallet" or even my "BTC Wallet" it wont let me and simply states that I have "0 available balance".... Even though I clearly have the balance on my coinbase account. I know for a fact that all of those sums were already cleared through my initial bank deposit since I checked the status and it stated "completed." Could this be some sort of glitch? I contacted support already and they are absolutely NO HELP. Its ridiculous. Perhaps I'm missing something and or theres something I need to do? I'm already level 3 verified on coinbase so it allows me to send/receive money.

I think the real question is, how many ribs will McAffee need to remove by the end of this year?
