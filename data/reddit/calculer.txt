localbitcoins works fine if you deal with trusted sellers, you can also use a bitcoin atm if you have one nearby

Peter Schiff is listened by the gold bugs, he is usually very accurate but he dislikes Bitcoin and sees it incorrectly as a bubble

I agree with almost everything you said but Companies accepting bitcoins and selling bitcoins on the exchanges is affects the price negatively, how could it be otherwise? Companies accepting bitcoins are good news so it affects the price positively too but the overall effect is still negative. 
If (when) a huge worldwide company like google, amazon or apple was accepting Bitcoin, the price would skyrocked nonetheless

I think that the crash of the dollar that will see the dollar lose most of its value will push people into gold&amp;Bitcoin, not the other way around

I did two weeks ago, I got the same response. Bitcoin would be a great tool for them since it will avoid the huge fees and charge backs

Block 281510 was an even 25BTC, no transactions fees apparently

That seems very interesting, that would be great to be able to book a plane ticket and get some bitcoins out of it

That sentence is particularly interesting "But right now the Fed hasn’t come down hard on Bitcoin so you wonder what’s going on. Why haven’t they?"

Localbitcoins with a trusted seller in cash or with a bank wire, on a Bitcoin ATM if you have one nearby.
If you want lower fees, you can also get verified on an exchange and wire money on the website to buy some bitcoins on the market, it may take a few weeks before they verify you depending on the exchange
