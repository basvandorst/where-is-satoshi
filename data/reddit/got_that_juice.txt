No one will truly be able to answer that question without future hindsight. Just go off your gut.
Adhere to one rule only: Don't invest more than you're willing to lose. Not to fear monger is anything, but Bitcoin could drop to 0 tomorrow.

@_date: 2013-12-07 19:37:58
Sure it will. One day they'll be able to advertise that they were the first in the area to accept Bitcoin...or even "longest in the business!". But that's really only a selling point once more people adopt it in the area. 
If they're the only ones accepting it for a while, they're distinguished by that fact alone. So for now, no big deal. In the future if Bitcoin succeeds in the area, then yes.
@_date: 2013-12-08 05:43:40

Here's what he said: 




Now I'm not saying the dude is wrong or anything, I'm just saying that I don't respect his opinion simply because of the way he presented it. From his comments I can't tell if he actually put the time in to critically analyze Bitcoin and form a conclusion- or if he's just speaking despite having only given Bitcoin a quick glance. 
His tone doesn't help me take him any more seriously either.
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:04:24
Yeah I wouldn't advertise that you're into Bitcoin if you want a seamless traveling experience. Good luck and have fun.
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:43:24

There should be no comparison here. If I understand you correctly, you're currently storing the majority of your btc in a Coinbase wallet. That's foolish. No disrespect to you, just helping you out.
Put those coins somewhere safe. Cold storage is a great idea.
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:15:29
Well the price is pretty low right now, so you must have sold pretttyyyy low to consider buying at this price a loss.
@_date: 2013-12-08 18:04:38
What about the ducks?
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:46:18


I find it hard to believe this. Don't take that statement for anything more than it's worth. I'm just saying I can't imagine that in the long run, outright buying a machine would not be cheaper than paying people on a daily basis. Especially when a machine could run 24/7. Even if it's only you running the booth, well- how much do you value your own time at? I still say a machine is cheaper in the long run.


I like this idea. A machine wouldn't work so well in that case. But I feel like a website built to cater to people like this would work better. Still, I can't deny the value of another human to speak to face to face when you want to warm up to something you're unfamiliar with.
Whatever you do, good luck.

Its not quite an exchange but [Coinbase](  has an android app. I think you have to be in the States though.
If there's a high risk that your phone may be stolen, you might find peace in using a hot wallet, or a wallet with an online backup option. [Blockchain.info]( offers this.  Here's a link to their [android app]( 
If you won't need to constantly spend your coins, consider getting a paper wallet. Just make sure that you keep the private key safe. Find out more about that [here]( 
Finally, if you don't mind me asking, where are you moving?
EDIT: Good luck with everything. Let me know if you have any further questions.

@_date: 2013-12-08 19:03:21
The process depends on what you're using for your wallet. Different clients have different interfaces for importing private keys. Tell us what you're using and we can help you better.
But generally: find the "import private key" or "import wallet" option. Doing that should allow you to spend from that wallet.

Sure it is.
But could Bitcoins be worth nothing in a few weeks?
Sure, that's a possibility as well. The point I'm trying to drive home here is that while things are looking good, no one knows where Bitcoin will go next. Invest at your own risk, and if someone tells you they know what will happen to Bitcoin- they're lying.
