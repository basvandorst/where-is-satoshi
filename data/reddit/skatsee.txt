god seriously, you know what the worst thing about this sudden surge in bitcoin popularity and price is?  The johns and beckys who bought in due to FOMO and think that they just won a get rich quick scheme and are trying to share the word of our lord and savior bitcoin, all because they bought in november at 5.8k and saw it hit 21k 3 weeks later

Why would you keep your coin in the exchange unless you were getting ready to trade them?  Why not store them in a wallet?

personally I don't see why anybody is using it as a ride to get anywhere.  I don't see why I can't just have a few bitcoin on me and buy dinner with it and be satisfied with that.  Trying to ride currency as if it were TSLA stock is asinine.  
(I have no affiliation with Tesla, just trying to say that buying bitcoin only with the intention of just turning around and turning it into fiat for a profit does absolutely nothing for the growth of bitcoin and is no investment)

my bad, I posted this in the wrong thread.  Was thinking it was the thread about marijuana dispensaries using it to avoid federal regulation

how about we spend bitcoins to promote their utility, rather than everybody holding onto them in hopes that their dollar value will rise so we can sell them for fiat currency at a higher rate then we bought then for...

@_date: 2014-04-11 02:11:10
a majority of the people on this circlejerk of a subreddit only subscribed after seeing the big bubbles in fiat exchange and really don't value bitcoin at all for its utility as a currency.  Those members are freaking out because they only like bitcoin because they were hoping it would be their get rich quick scheme and are starting to realize that its not
@_date: 2014-11-16 04:56:14
how about you use your bitcoin and circulate it instead of treating it like a stock

i'm like, 99% positive eBay used to let you list an item and a ticker that says that they accept BitCoin.  It would even list the item in a search if you had included the word BitCoin, but I can't seem to get it to reproduce this measure :/

Is it Satoshi?  I thought he didn't exist?

I understand that bitcoin is, for the most part secure.  But... what with all the recent headlines about high scale robbery on the network, do you guys really find it that safe?  Safe enough for all your paychecks?
@_date: 2012-08-11 07:18:17
how is it illegal in the first place?
Bitcoins aren't a legal tender.  Sure, they're traded for legal tender, but the coins themselves are not.  Its like buying jolly ranchers, using those as chips.

nobody is going to look at you funny for tipping in a bar, it's just not as common
@_date: 2013-06-09 13:16:01
really the only reason I brought up the whole tipping thing, is because of how crazy the community is about tipping with bitcoin

I've thought about bitcoin lending over and over again, but I just can't grasp how it would work.  The only thing I've come up with is if a bank is established that holds your wallet and you sign contracts with them.

good video, but damn does it really feel like BFL screwed the pooch on this one. 
Made a whole bunch of promises about their product, and not only could they not ship what they had promised, but what they did ship was only about a year late

I had a fear with Coinbase for a minute because after I sold some coin, the status went straight to complete instead of pending (quite the contrary when you buy, the week or so you have to wait, the status says pending, and once you get your coin it says complete).  Naturally I freaked out because I had a few thousand dollars that Coinbase said I had, which had not gone through my bank yet (but I wasn't extremely freaked out because it skipped the pending status entirely)
I just ticketed their support and they said this is normal and to wait 5-7 days

all but four of those were once available in the shop
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:51:06
but wait.  Doesn't putting bitcoin into cold storage do absolutely nothing for the currency?  Wouldn't using bitcoins in trade be what you actually want?  Not selling it for fiat, but using it to buy every day items?  Putting into circulation?  Isn't that what the people in the camp that want to see bitcoin succeed as a currency should be doing?  Putting it into cold storage does absolutely nothing except for create a memory.  If everybody put every bitcoin into cold storage it would be worth nothing.

I thought this, except then it could be easily confused with data storage.  Sure its not really used in the negative power, but things such as kilabit megabit and gigabit are already commonly used.  
Still do able, but as somebody had already mentioned, dropping coin all together would be prime, but I don't think it would be wise to drop both coin and bit, but bit is already taken, leaving coin as the only logical choice. 
Just my two cents
@_date: 2013-06-09 12:08:53
was rather sarcastic

Why can't you say that Bitcoin100 sent *nearly 10BTC* to KhanAcademy.org?  Isn't that sort of the whole point of this subreddit, to spread the usage of Bitcoin, instead of dollars?
*edit: because i'm dumb and can't math*
@_date: 2013-11-02 05:01:15
In my opinion we should really just drop the bit prefix and add a metric standard.
฿0.1 = 1decicoin
฿0.01 = 1centicoin
฿0.001 = 1millicoin
฿0.0001 = 1microcoin
฿0.00001 = 1nanocoin
฿0.000001 = 1picocoin
฿0.0000001 = 1femtocoin
฿0.00000001 = 1attocoin
Of course not all of these would necessarily be used in practicality the same way that nobody uses decimeters.  But I mean, there's a perfectly good system already established and well in place throughout the world, why not use it.
