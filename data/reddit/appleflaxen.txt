This has been happening to me for a god damn year. The first time, I sent a message and asked to speak with someone on the phone, and was told I had to EMAIL so you could validate my identity.
EMAIL!? For IDENTITY!? I was calling from the same phone linked to my account. It was straight up baffling, and the shit still isn't fixed.

Upvoted for interesting points, but I disagree. All that is needed for bitcoin to succeed as a currency is for the number of merchants accepting it to continue to increase. The fact that a currency has a value measured in terms of other currencies, or the fact that the value is increasing due to speculation, is entirely irrelevant.

Really? What about the internet filter that your government was taking about making. I thought it got set up as default for the while country. That kind of censorship is pretty crazy.
US has it's own major problems, though.

I understood that he sent it to the address payed by the site for payments. they forget confirmed it in subsequent communication. it's fairly straightforward, in this case

OP definitely has a legal case... he just might not be able to enforce it easily. but he should absolutely file a court claim against the wallet holder and try to get a judgment against them to send it back.

you keep saying he has to sweep something, which is false, and suggests that you don't understand how money works.
when you withdraw a dollar at the bank, do you freak out because it's not the same serial number you deposited?

if you represent yourself as a hackers site, and don't understand why PayPal is a terrible option, then you deserve the PayPal treatment more than most.

please explain this imaginary threat model of yours in which knowing the owner identity and public key of a cold wallet somehow compromises it.

what are you talking about? pay the dude his bitcoin back. don't want to sweep your cold wallet? fine: pay him back with your trading funds. hell: pay him back in an equivalent fiat amount and let him buy his own bitcoin.
but the courts will absolutely see this as being within their jurisdiction, and no technical argument about wallets is going to change the facts that are fairly straightforward.

You mean buttcoin?

But i'm confused; how can you re-use the same wallet address? I thought your secret key was disclosed by the act of spending it. No? I've tried to understand this better, but can't find a good technical description of what the act of authorizing a transaction means.

That's a great clarification / correction. But even if the same person does on both businesses, the fact that they're legally separate entities does protect funds from the independent business from being seized as part of the legal action.

Can someone elaborate on this? I thought that it was essentially impossible to spend a fraction of the coins at a particular address (based in this: 
Is that true?
