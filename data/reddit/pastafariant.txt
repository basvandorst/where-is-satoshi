Not really a "Dilema".  Was just asking a question for the opinions of others.  Not sure why everyone and their brother seems to bring up how little bit coin I have...  thanks for the input.

So the security is really, just transferring a little bitcoin to a changetip wallet.  They don't technically have access to your coinbase acct info.  It's just like put 20 bucks in a separate account, then tipping people from that account?
@_date: 2014-11-06 16:49:18
wtf is changetip?  Please someone, update me.

I get it 4-5 coins isn't baller status.  You're the 5th person to get that.  I just see the value drop by 50+% in a year.  Feeling like the 1000+ dollar mark was just a bubble.  Lately it feels like a guy in wolf of wall street trying to talk their clients into not selling their shit.  A lot of faith based cheer-leading, but not a lot of tangible reinforcement.  Didn't everyone say 2014 is going to be the BIG year for BTC?  All I saw was a huge loss in value, not sure how this makes it a BIG year for it.  It's a side investment to play with, on top of my normal long term 401k/IRA and so on.  Do you have 1000+ coins, and if you do... how are you staying say sane with how much value BTC has lost...?  I'm not talking day trading here, this is a YEAR past...and the value has been pretty steadily dropping.

I'm using coinbase currently, how do I do this?  The whole paper wallet, and safety deposit box.  Thanks.

I see, thanks for the changetip.  I was seeing how to withdraw, and it's asking me to login to my coinbase account.  I guess I'd give it my coinbase wallet id, so the id allows deposits only and not withdraws.  That answers my security concern.
@_date: 2014-11-06 16:57:51
So in order to send/receive tips, you have to have a wallet already?  Example I have a coinbase account, would I need to setup a changetip acct to associate?  Would the person receiving the tip also need their wallet tied to it?  Is there not any worry about security, once you tie your account to changetip?  Can changetip be hacked, then your associate account get drained?  So many questions lol.

Thanks friend.

Was looking for some reinforcing information, are most people riding the BTC roller coaster on faith alone?
@_date: 2014-12-22 16:14:29
Well to be fair, that was for dot-com companies.  I'm not in that industry, I basically work for "the man".  The company i'm under deals mostly with the military industrial complex, which has had steady profit since 9/11.  Still a legit point though.

HODL?  I didn't mean to post this, I thought I hid cancel.

My game plan was to ride the BTC train for 5 years, w/out messing w/it.  This 15% stock discount program seems like a decent deal, since it's pretty much a 15% return right off the bat.  That's the only real reason I'm debating it.  I'm not into BTC for day trading, it was a long term plan.  It's just hard to keep faith with 50% loss in value, then again, people are always saying how volatile it is.  Thanks for the input.  Giving me a lot to think about.
@_date: 2014-12-22 14:01:25
It's more of an opinion question, seeing what other's would do in my position.
@_date: 2014-12-22 16:22:50
Whoa, you can claim tax benefits?  Can you give me more info on that?
@_date: 2014-12-22 17:15:23
Wasn't looking for a morality lesson, thanks.
@_date: 2014-09-19 13:11:08
Wow, I'm new to bitcoin, only have 1.3btc.  Looked up the GOX story, that's terrible.  I'm using coinbase currently, I guess there is no real guarantee.  I've heard stories of other sites being hacked as well.  What's the safest bet, or what site you suggest?
@_date: 2014-12-22 14:06:12
"Redditor for 14 days"  downvotes all my comments lol.
@_date: 2014-12-22 13:59:51
Realistically, how likely is it that BTC is going to double again?  I feel like the 1000+ pricing we saw a while back was just a bubble, and it's never going to hit that price again, at least not for another decade.
@_date: 2015-08-25 13:46:38
can you give details?  I was looking through settings and such, but couldn't find it anywhere.  I'm not talking about "hey i'd like to buy $50.00 in bitcoin, when bitcoin is 250/coin".  I'm talking more in terms of "hey BTC price has dropped to $50.00/coin buy buy buy".
@_date: 2015-08-25 14:55:01
not sure what that is, or how to set it on coinbase?
@_date: 2015-08-25 15:12:50
Is there an option within regular coinbase, to get an alert when prices drop below x$?  Thanks.
@_date: 2015-08-25 15:11:11
ya :-(, unfortunately Virginia is cunty, and requires a license or some shit.  AKA I can't use it, since i live in Northern VA.  Moving to Denver soon, but looks like that's also a state that I can't use Exchange it.. FML.
@_date: 2015-08-19 18:11:19
what, it never got to 175 according to the coinbase.com chart?
Edit - Just read some article, fuck it went as low as 163... I've been waiting for it to go $50+ lower than what I bought them at, so I could buy more.
@_date: 2015-08-25 14:55:22
Great, thanks!
@_date: 2015-07-13 18:32:47
Surely someone from coinbase will reply...
@_date: 2015-07-13 12:24:34
I posted about this a few minutes ago, and someone was trying to say the cloudminr.io leak was related... should I be worried?  He/She made it sound like coinbase accounts could be involved in the DB leak?
