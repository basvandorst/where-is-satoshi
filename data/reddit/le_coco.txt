Totally agree, chart is actually a copy of the last pre- pump... but bigger. Since the growth is exponencial maybe we end this year really happy all of us :)

@_date: 2017-12-15 15:34:16
not at all hahaha i just see an exponential growth but i dont have much time right now to study the math behind. But if you had some data i would love to see it.
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:57:03

hello, i'm here to say that in these last month i went all in and i see great things happening in crypto. I didnt regret at all. And now im scary as fuck. But im not selling because im fucking sure that THIS IS THE ECONOMY OF FUTURE, so even if this money means really importan projects to me, i dont care if its goes down to the floor. What btc did in a couple of months it will be done again. This is not the last fall that we will have. Maybe not even the worst. But since even my mother is talking about btc im totally sure that it is going to saturn. Bc we already reached the moon.
HODL HODLERS WE ARE TOGHETHER HERE!!

Im not agree, the price depends on demand. If more people get interested in it the price rise up bc a % of them start to buy. Ofc the volatily rise too, bc if more public knowledge becomes, more people who dont understand deeply the technology behind easy money, more easy its to then panic. This volatility is bc of that. But if i learned something studying the.behaviour of btc is that if.goes down 100, after rise up 1000.

He said "If bitcoin breaks 11k again today, I'll eat my own dick. That's how confident I am that it won't." And it didn't.
@_date: 2018-03-03 17:37:42
Hahahaha i was thinking the same. But i would ate his dick if btc have reach 11k that day. So he should be safe.
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:33:25
it's not about if im happy with that or not, its about its reasonable, cryptos in general are for long term, bc in short term its pretty obvious to see this kind of movements.
@_date: 2018-04-13 21:22:35
This is the bart chart, we all knew that, i'm expecting for a real bull run between june and october and then i'm pretty convinced that we'll get the 35k, still just be patient, it's pretty reasonable that drops maybe to 7200, and is still better than 6800... Btc growth like that, jumping and dumping... one year ago we were close to 1000. Nothing else to say.

its happening boys!!
