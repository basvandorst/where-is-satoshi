According to some digging I did earlier the origin of this quote seems to come from an interview of him about the whole Snowden thing back in 2013.
He left his position as CEO of Google (to become executive chairman) the year prior. It's not unreasonable to think whoever made the above image originally did not yet realise that he had switched positions. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:23:32
What? But he *was* CEO of Google. Sure, he got even more important positions later, but people probably can't relate to "EC of Alphabet Inc." as much as they can relate to "CEO of Google"

Man, I'm not even going to hide a thing this time. If you are this retarded I genuinely feel sorry for you.

Hm, yes a position on the board with a sizable chunk of GOOG shares and the additional position of "technical adviser" whatever that can mean in practice...
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:11:23
I mean he is EC of Alphabet (the parent corporation of Google) which is arguably an even more influential position than CEO of Google.
However, nobody knows wtf an Alphabet or an Executive Chairman means, so I guess they used his former title so readers had a better idea of who he is.

Yeah what's up with that. Who names their son Machiavelli without expecting them to turn out either criminals or politicians.
@_date: 2018-10-22 12:14:39
That's what I assumed, but 2pac/Makavelli, too, took his name from Machiavelli... and while he wasn't strictly a criminal, he still had that gangster/thug/badboy image going on.

Sorry another user explained to me how I misunderstood the source of mining difficulty. I take back most of my deducted statements in that light.


The lack of novel cash flow? That's how currency value is adjusted by central banks nowadays.


Making drug trades cyptographically has always been an option since the invention of private/public-key encryption. Bitcoin just made it 10x times easier when it came out.

What is valuable to the market is very different from what is valuable to the average person. I do agree, however. Bitcoin is most definitely not a bad thing in the long term, but this energy usage issue is still a worryingly unexpected problem that I think we should observe for a bit before drawing drastic conclusions about whether it's a good or bad thing.
@_date: 2018-11-08 09:10:09
That explains a lot to me that I fundamentally misunderstood about the BTC network.
I feel like your first point puts my energy-related concerns mostly to rest.
Your second point, still however raises the same question of the future of mining... The reward will keep halving, so the barrier of entry for profitable mining will keep increasing... That is, unless quantum computing goes mainstream before then, in which case the barrier of entry will remain very low for the rest of the century.
But what if QC doesn't go mainstream? The only ones who would profit off mining (assuming the BTC price remains much more stable than what we've seen) are those firms and corporations who can afford huge server farms.
Also, what if a mining farm that was 20 times larger than the next one opened operations tomorrow? Would that not create an instant monopoly such that most small miners wouldn't be able to compete?

I live in a country that produces more renewable energy than it even uses at all. And I genuinely think pollution is wholly irrelevant, I have no idea when it was even brought into the discussion by anyone but you. The problem is that energy production is increasing at a slower rate than Bitcoin mining energy consumption is increasing.
This looks like a textbook example of a catastrophic scenario in the making, which is why I am so wary about this. Even if it won't happen, what's stopping it from happening right now? Bitcoin provides a lot of value in various parts of the world, but it is also taking value by 'artificially' driving up demand for energy in certain parts of the world.
And no, this is not a major problem yet. My point is, nothing is as of currently stopping it from becoming a major problem. It's not even guaranteed that Bitcoin will grow by this much, but if we take the most optimistic figures, it almost certainly will.

By exchanging something other than digital currency, that doesn't happen to be traceable either. Cash in the mail is the most classic example, but you could also mail checks, remotely exchange non-monetary valuables (not neccesarily by mail), trade through a local middle man (street drug trades are essentially the same with dozens of middlemen instead), in the Islamic World + India there is also an ancient system called Hawala, used for exchanging value over great distances, and which also has limited availability in other places with many muslims (e.g. Europe). The last two options require that your network permits them, however.
None of these neccesitate cryptography, though, that's just neccesary on the internet in general for contacting a seller.
@_date: 2018-11-07 09:53:50
While I disagree with him that it's for absolutely nothing whatsoever, you've still *got* to admit that Bitcoin mining provides substantially less value for the average person than most other things our energy is being used for.
@_date: 2018-11-07 12:29:22
This "mere incentive mechanism" is the only mechanism driving mining **at all**, don't forget that. Without this "mere" incentive mechanism only hardcore nerds would be doing mining, and there's just no way the currency would have grown to what it is today.
"Mining efficiency is measured in hashes per joule" is like something straight out of , because it completely ignores that some people in 2nd world countries have made 6-figure businesses out of Bitcoin mining. Do you really want to claim that those businesses have nothing to do with the growth of Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-11-07 21:59:15
Are you not aware how Bitcoin works? For all transactions on the network to be registered, a new block has to be mined, and in order to 'mine' a new block you have to guess cryptological hashes until you hit a block.
As blocks become more scarce, it will take more time and processing power (and **energy**) to mine each subsequent block, and this energy price will only increase exponentially in the future.


There are physical limits to how much computing power you can squeeze out of a particular physical space. Are you proposing that in the future, bitcoin mining should be monopolised by huge corporations? Would that not undermine the independence of the network as a whole?
Furthermore, how many people would such a corporation be able to employ, given Bitcoin mining's dwindling profitablity in the future?
@_date: 2018-11-07 11:06:01


This is exactly one of the reasons mining will **not** become more efficient but less. As it takes more and more computing power to mine the next block, and as the reward keeps shrinking, the energy consumption of Bitcoin mining per dollar earned will only increase faster and faster.
The question is whether that shortcoming is acceptable and worth it, or whether some kind of countermeasures might be neccesary. Right now only time can tell.

You are making the mistake of thinking about this in purely economic terms like most other people here.
My worries lie not in whether the price of BTC will keep going up indefinitely, that's just an impossibility. What I am worried about is that as BTC stabilises and stops growing in price, the energy required to mine each subsequent block will increase exponentially. Where will this energy come from? And if it is possible to provide it, is it worth allocating as much of our available energy as possible for the one purpose of keeping the BTC network stable?
As I've discussed with another commenter, it takes energy to manipulate information, that's a physical law, but the energy human beings currently have available is quite limited. Is it really reasonable to use so much energy on something that provides the exact same value as previous solutions, which don't even rely on a fraction of BTC's energy consumption?
It is certainly not a particularly big problem now, but it's a problem that's heading in an increasingly worrying direction. What if the current 5 million global active users of cryptos were joined by an additional 7 billion overnight? The sheer number of transactions would be an issue in and on itself, but imagine the astronomic energy consumption it would take to mine each subsequent block in the network, just to keep the system from crashing...
I remember now, that I understand that a 'last' bitcoin will eventually be mined sometime in the next century. How profitable would bitcoin mining be at this point? What would happen next as devaluation and revaluation becomes impossible? What happens if the currency crashes and there is no way to artificially manipulate its value?
I think Bitcoin is a great and ultimately beneficial idea, but right now it's main use is black market trading and money laundering... not general payment solutions. Furthermore, I cannot see it taking on this role in the near future, and if the trends about which we discourse continue, not in the far future either.
@_date: 2018-11-07 10:47:41
Energy production, renewable or not, is currently increasing linearly, while the trend for bitcoin energy consumption seems a lot more exponential. You don't think that might become problematic in the future by inflating energy demand?
@_date: 2018-11-07 12:26:21
It takes energy to manipulate information, yes, any computer scientist or even physicist will be able to tell you that, but the question is not whether it's worth it (which it almost certainly is) but rather how much priority we should give it compared to other things, since the energy consumption we've seen so far exceeds expectation by quite a margin.
