But your btc can be traced and blacklisted unless you use something private and fungible.

Last hardfork changed Monero to a fixed ringsize of 11.

You are right and they are downvoting you because they are salty. Since Bitcoin doesn't have mandatory bulletproof privacy and is therefore not a fungible good by using a mixer your are tainting your bitcoin and in time they will be less valuable than clean ones. Your coins could mix with the ones of drug dealers and terrorists. You wouldn't want to be dragged into that in case of an investigation. Use something that's mandatory private and with guarantees of strong privacy primitives on the base layer. Bitcoin was born crippled with a transparent blockchain.

I washed mine on [Bisq]( with [Monero]( KYC and AML are authoritarian. I'm surprised they haven't been abolished yet. Mixers like Wasabi are for noobs. They are going to be chainalysed.

It doesn't give you privacy. Nothing is hidden. Sender, receiver sum are all recorded there forever. Doing privacy on the second layer is a bad idea. The base layer should be the most private then erode some fungibility if need arises on subsequent layers. Currently you have the perfect setup for "taintable btc". 
1 tainted btc != 1 clean btc. (which will reflect in price when bitcoin will actually attempt to become money)
By the way money supply can be verified on opaque blockchains as well.

Cool way to taint your bitcoins and make them less valuable in the future when chain analysis on everything will be the norm.

Sound money is fungible which Bitcoin is not. It's also transparent which is very bad for wealth storage and spending.
@_date: 2019-01-19 15:03:08
No it's not. Bitcoin was born crippled with a transparent blockchain resulting in very bad things like taint, tx spying, a dangerous place to store and use wealth in a nutshell. Even fiat cash is less traceable.  Monero with its opaque blockchain fixed that. Do you really think we will wait and see if Bitcoin does what it takes to become fungible and mandatory private when there's already something better around?  And before somebody will tell me that Bitcoin can just bolt on some weak ass privacy I want to say that you will never get consensus for mandatory base layer strong privacy primitives.
LE: I know lightning is cheap but I churned all my Monero bag for 0.18 cents with the security and privacy of the base layer.

Dude Bitcoin is an open book. Nobody wants to keep books on the worlds most open book.

I'd say there wasn't enough tech at the time(like bulletproofs) to make it fungible and perfect. He just wanted Bitcoin to be the trojan horse that opened the floodgate to truly fungible crypto like Monero.

It won't be in Bitcoin. The 60 billion you see there is mostly speculative not for saving or usage. Wealth will be stored on an opaque blockchain. It's dangerous to store wealth on such a transparent network.

Can't wait to see fractional reserve banking with Bitcoin /s.
I'm not against fractional reserve banking as long as banks don't mislead people into thinking they actually store each customers' money in their tiny little box. There's a case for free market fractional reserve banking and also a case for full reserve. Maybe you want a free account or maybe you want to pay. That was the beauty of the free market before the central bank cartels were formed.
@_date: 2019-01-22 07:32:32
So what? The base layer will remain transparent. You have to rely on bolted on weak second layer. There's also the fact that optional privacy is not privacy.
2+x=5 - optional
x+y=z - mandatory
Chain analysis firms will eat you for breakfast.
And you do realize this market is very competitive. There's no consumer loyalty if Bitcoin can't deliver the goods. As someone who considers crypto for digital offshoring Bitcoin is too dangerous.
LE: Being an active form of mixing Coinjoin(coinjoin is optional anyway not mandatory) can be Sybil attacked. Tx graphs can be made.  Weaaak.

Just because I'm against the SEC doesn't mean I believe fraud is right. You probably know that but your agenda is to mock people who still believe in individual freedoms. We don't need a nanny state is what I'm saying because it's against freedom.

How would they justify wasting so much taxpayer money on a fruitless wild goose chase? The Hollywood cartel has spent hundreds of millions fighting P2P file sharing which is not even incentivized with billions of dollars to survive. People share their files for free. They actually think they will stop crypto? Ha ha.

Yep. My money is out of the system.

Inflation is legalized counterfeiting of money supply. It distorts the structure of production and encourages squandering of capital. Economic calculation and price signals are tampered with artificially. Inflation helps the establishment fund wars and nonsensical megalomaniac projects that would never obtain finances on the free market. Sound money is a good investment that doesn't lose value. In a non central bank cartelized economy your money should buy you more stuff every year because of increases in productivity. The thing I hate the most about these Keynesian self righteous pricks is that they see the economy as a system that needs to be fine tuned and that they are entitled to do this on behalf of us. In reality, as Hayek said information is dispersed in society and the free market self regulates. The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design.

If $1 =$1 always you would never need a laundromat or a mixer if we're talking Bitcoin. Use something fungible and untraceable. The fact that people don't care about this is proof that most hoard these assets instead of spending because when you spend you care about taint.
@_date: 2018-12-24 21:29:28


It's good for the counterfeiter which buys stuff with the new money before the prices have adjusted to the new supply.


Prices will adjust to the new money supply as the new money streams down. But you will not be wealthier because everything will have adjusted in price.


Yes. Government is robbing their purchasing power. We are putting an end to this.


It promotes misallocation of resources based on fake prices.


There is no such thing as a one size fits all optimal spending. Each actor in the economy calculates this based on his localized interpretation of prices because information in society is dispersed. We are not living in centrally planned communist economies.


Still not a good justification for theft. It will not happen like that since markets self regulate.


Gold has been money for thousands of years.

The whims of the gamblers on the market are one thing and the technology is another. It's good to be price blind. The code speaks louder.

Of course crypto is a safe haven. They are the system, crypto is the anti-system. I still remember the savings account "haircuts" practiced in some states during the Eurocrisis.  Or the disgusting "solidarity" taxes. I will never let them do that to my money.

It's not obvious where the the top is. People were calling top for every $500 increase since Jan 2017. Hindsight warriors are a dime a dozen. The mirage of predicting the future is strong with traders.

You are not alone Elon! The free market doesn't need to be bullied around by these economy commissars from their NY politburo.

There's no free banking. The charade we have today is a central bank run banking cartel with a fiat money monopoly. They actually think they can design and fine tune money and it's usage. Now in what ideology was central planning a thing, hmm?��

Yeah. It's infested with normies, suits and Krugman's minions. And is leaking.

I won't. I'm in crypto since it was about bringing down the government and it's banking cartel.
