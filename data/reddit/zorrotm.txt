I don't mean to insult anyone but if you guys actually traded you would understand the next support level is not $1000 or £1000.

It would be right around the $6000 mark. This would be the point we should be looking for a retest at and if it holds the bulls will officially be in control.

It is always very easy to distinguish the traders from the emotional investors. 
If there was only moon or crash then we would always see straight lines up and down, but that isn't how the market runs, that is how a emotional investor views the market.

You do understand that low volume means there aren't as many buyers, right? If you watch the video through you learn more than just reading the title.

We are recovering from a bear market we are not in a bull market atm. There seems to be some confusion on that point. While I believe it is recovering and will again be bullish the overall sentiment (besides a narrow view) is bearish still...
You are incorrect in saying that none of the pullbacks were retested. We are retesting everything now back to the points that had not been previously retested. You don't have to retest every support but you have to establish new supports and BTC hasn't been doing that, it rushed up to $20k without establishing any supports along the way.
Lastly anybody can be a "trader" especially in crypto and if somebody wasn't losing money then you couldn't make money so bad traders are part of the market, to manipulate that statistic to make it sound like TA trading is why they lose is just plain ignorance. The pro crypto traders I know make 2-3 bad trades a year, that's it, out of thousands.

Bitfinex is most definitely manipulating heavily. I think their time is short and they are taking out as much money with then as they can. They've been doing this a long time but they are just getting sloppy now. Letting their bots run too soon, too long, too obvious
