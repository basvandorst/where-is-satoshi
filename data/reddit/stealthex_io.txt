That's right, Stealthex.io works similar to how ShapeShift used to. We do not have registration, we are anonymous, user-friendly and KYC-free. And everything should work with Tor!

I will speak for myself, a simple person working remotely. For two years I have earned in the areas related to cryptocurrency, more than I would have earned on my main job for 10 years. I am not a financial expert to wait for super growth or vice versa collapse. But lately I have bought a lot of things for myself, which in our city is not for the majority of the population. And on those around me who say something out of envy I don't give a damn.
