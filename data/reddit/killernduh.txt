Today morning when i see bitcoin at 4000 brings great relief.

It's not like we are doing stamp collection. Ultimately it's the value in dollars, is what matters.

What do you think btc-forextrader ?
@_date: 2018-11-23 07:45:49
HAHA! One of those people who would cry latter "wish I had invested some when it was ripe". 
@_date: 2018-11-29 13:02:59
Yes gullible people like me enjoy the sunshine and hold courage to stand the frost of night. 
Think about it
@_date: 2018-11-29 13:48:28
Explain ?

Came here for the video(no go), walking out with exploding kittens(go go go).

We are in this subreedit not because we just believe in this technology but also we understand the potential this technology has. That said My intention while posting this article was to open a healthy discussion on the other side of the coin which this gentleman has failed to explore with his myophic vision of the industry. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:37:36
We need people to start using bitcoins on daily transaction then just hoarding. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 18:30:04
Probably I m not with right people for discussion ... Don't respond to this post. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 04:53:43
I agree with you luccio, being sceptic is one thing but when a ignorant shows arrogance these kind if articles hit the front pages. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 08:50:50
Why not.
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:00:07
They were nerds. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 12:46:45
I have been following ccn for quite some time, source seems quite credible. BTW did you read the article.
@_date: 2018-11-29 12:50:49
This companies valuation is directly dependant on bitcoin price. NOt sure if its hedge fund thou
@_date: 2018-11-29 07:42:36
Bitcoin prices have been very volatile. Yesterday was just a bonus, lets not get too excited and wait for some more time. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 07:29:16
Probably he was just trying to make his article bit more spooky. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 09:01:14
This should cover your question
 
@_date: 2018-11-23 12:52:43
Sometimes we don't understand things and we try to compare it with something which we know or already seen. For me "bubble" is wrong analogy to explain bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-29 07:59:22
So relatable. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:04:44
That's true. People who lost faith were only took trade not for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 13:15:11
Classic reverse psychology. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 10:42:20
So true, its upto us.
@_date: 2018-11-28 12:30:31
Thats a lot !
@_date: 2018-11-23 07:36:21
This guy truly believes that he is a visionary and his foresight on bitcoin industry is going to save us. Great 
@_date: 2018-11-26 09:57:27
You never know, too early to speculate.
@_date: 2018-11-23 07:17:10


One of those classic people who are only good at bitching.

Every day is not a sunday, there are monday's too. :P

So you agree POW is not efficient enough. There are other models that can be used as a replacement to POW. In technology industry this is called upgradation. Similar to this, our banking system are running on legacy systems with strong resistance to upgradation. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 07:10:20
Because the unproven model is an improvement on the previous model. It is more efficient and economically/ environmentally friendly as well.
@_date: 2018-12-03 11:55:46
@_date: 2018-12-07 07:29:40
The large Mining farms in a POW network also run the same risk, once the liquidity in the network increases and more and more transactions are made on the network it will run efficaciously. The decentralization of setting up nodes would deter the rich getting richer analogy.
