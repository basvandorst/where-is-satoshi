BTC should be a viable currency, not just a digital store of wealth. If you need to wait more than a few minutes on any sort of purchase for confirmation, it's useless as a currency

BTC is a currency. People using it as such are what gives it value in the first place. BTC wouldn't be worth anything if not for dark net markets

A short while ago a Bitcoin ATM opened up in a shop next door to my workplace. It's more convenient to exchange my tips for Bitcoin using cash than to deposit at a bank ATM then buy online. Plus I can withdraw bitcoins in cash when coinbase doesn't allow fiat withdrawals in my country.

Traderoute was a dark net marketplace for drugs that recently scammed its users for roughly 7 million dollars in bitcoin. If that's a TradeRoute address, he's screwed.
