US Bond holders will  not sell in such a rapid manner thar it would cause currency structural issues because in selling they harm the value of the very assets they hold. IE the value of bond fall and hence their own assets and value. 
$1.12T is more than these economies can stand to loose. 
Not a threat in the near term/ rapidly.

It’s from 2017...

This is an awesome and poetic reply. Trustless system is key for blockchain/crypto in general but do you have thoughts specifically for bitcoin (building on these points)

Russia buying BTC in that quantity would be bad long term for BTC. Good in the short run. 
It would be bad for the BTC brand in the wealthiest economies which is where BTC needs to successful.

Agree for the short term. I am arguing long term.

I think this is a great response. It has a lot of overlap to my three coming into the post. I am re writing the three adding combining your information. 
1.) Bitcoin and the internet are tied at the hip. Conceptually people are still wrapping their heads around the fact all they need to is an internet connection to have access to money. It’s a fundamental shift so the longer the currency lasts the more ‘legit’ it will become. Furthermore Internet growth will only drive more crypto adoption. For bitcoin it has a fixed supply of 21M and the work required to mine going forward will be more difficult. So supply is truly limited. As more people get exposure and more opportunities are created to allow people to own bitcoin, it will grow. Today 1% of internet users own BTC (Its probably less, I read that there are 22M bitcoin wallets so 22M/3.2B=0.007 —&gt; 0.7%). 
2.)  Bitcoin becomes the new gold. It has already become the benchmark for all crypto and unlike gold is accessible to anyone with an internet connection.  It will become the currency used in crisis. Examples: Venezuela, (others????). It can be accessed with an oppressive gov in place and act as a holder of value in countries at risk of hyperinflation and economic crisis without risk of seizure (like physical gold could). The technical risks will diminish the longer BTC is around and adoption from institutional money will increase the longer bitcoin is in existence.
3.) Increased Adoption makes BTC more practical. As the number of users increases and as more time passes and technical risks decline the number of merchants and businesses willing to take BTC as a payment method will increase. Today companies like Microsoft, Subway, Reddit, and Overstock ( 100k+ globally: Source CNBC) all accept Bitcoin as a payment method. The more merchants that accept bitcoin the more it can be used as a day to day currency for countries with troubled financial systems, or for travelers who don’t want to pay currency exchange fees. 
Any further suggestions on how to strengthen these or if there is a key point made in another post that I can roll into one of the points please call it out.
Thank you again!
