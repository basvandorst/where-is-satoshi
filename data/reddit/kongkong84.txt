I'm registered on CoinMap. One of 4 businesses that take BTC in Lexington, Kentucky. It's pretty neat to see on there. But yeah, wtf is that cologne.

Very true. They are releasing an Android version of the app as well.

Weird. I had the same dream two nights ago. Seriously.

Can anyone explain how the markets can be manipulated? Be it stock market, bitcoin, whatever, how is BIG MONEY able to manipulate prices? Just curious. I see a lot of people say this but never see explanations.

Pheeva guys gave out bitcoin every hour (raffle style) to people who downloaded their wallet.

Man that sucks. Hard. Really sorry to hear about this. Don't give up though. Be persistent with local law enforcement. Seriously like the above comments, go talk to them face to face. 
I had my motorcycle stolen about a year and a half ago. I seriously thought I would never see it again. But a year later, I saw it parked downtown (stripped of all ID but I knew it was mine.) My first instinct was to try and steal it back. But instead I went to the police TWICE with pictures of myself on the scooter (taken 2 years before) that showed some of the same visible damage. That was enough for the police and they got it back for me. Blew my mind. So...your situation is different. But there is always hope. You COULD have an IP address. That's more than I had. 
Good luck man. I hope you get it back and that dick gets whats coming to him.

That's the dilemma. I hate androids. I like iPhones. But I hate Apple's death grip on everything they don't like. I have a very love/hate relationship with Apple.

More Breaking News: Apple bans everything.

I just started accepting BTC for my video work, and registered on CoinMap. I'm currently talking to my first "bitcoin" paying potential client, so I'm pretty excited. I'll let you know how it goes.

Pheeva wallet works great on my iPhone 5.

Yep. I didn't understand reddit at all before. Now I love it. Not just for bitcoin threads either.

What about this part?
"CoG, named after the management philosophy of a Japanese zipper manufacturer, gets around the app store restrictions using an Apple Enterprise Developer License. This license lets a company distribute an app to members of its own organization without going through the app store, for a relatively cheap $299 per year.
“It’s the same thing as us getting a standard Apple developer’s license, but the enterprise developer’s license enables us to distribute apps to people inside our organization,” Wilson said. The app is installed using an enterprise certificate signed by CoG.
“If Apple reads it and then they change their terms of service, then they will have to change it for everyone,” he said."

Seems super secure to me. They claim not to store anyone's keys unencrypted.

Hey I'm in this picture.

Also...everyone will just start jail breaking their iPhones if Apple doesn't loosen up.
