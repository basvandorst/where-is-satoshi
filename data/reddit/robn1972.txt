Hope you all like it. We had fun making it and it was a way to deal with the stress of having BTC trapped at gox.

Sorry for not stating that.  It's gotten really expensive to send t-shirts through international mail.  If our site shows some growth we would consider changing that policy in the future.

 So in light of my issues with Coinbase and Circle (a discussion for another post), I no longer have an easy way to buy BTC.
  I have set up the most basic of sites with the hopes that some people with BTC would like to trade for genuine 1 ounce silver bars.  While serious silver buyers would want to shop at places like Apmex or Amagi, a casual buyer wanting a single ounce or perhaps a buyer outside the USA wanting discretion and anonymity might find my site useful.  No records are kept, and all bars are shipped with contents and values unknown and worldwide shipping is available! 
  If interested, check out the site!  My direct contact info is right on the site if you have any questions, but it's pretty straight forward.  I simply want to sell small amounts of real silver bars (1 ounce) for small amounts of bitcoin, that's pretty much it :-)
