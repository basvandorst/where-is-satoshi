Guns are designed to injure and kill. Aside from some target shooting guns, that's a blatant fact. Even hiding behind "personal protection" does not take away from the fact that guns are designed to injure and kill. If that's not universally accepted, then there are a lot of god damn idiots in the universe. And I don't care that you qualified what you said with the word "humans". Because, you know what, those same guns that people hunt with injure and kill human beings too. That's the problem we want to solve. That takes precedence over people's gun collecting hobbies. I'm sorry that I don't want people to lose their one chance to be alive and breathing. Life is a little more precious that your stupid fucking gun collection.


Sure. 1 dead domestic terrorist is equivalent to the 50 dead innocent civilians he just murdered. Good logic. 


Are you fucking serious? You have got to be trolling. How many massacres have been stopped by "good guys with guns" that aren't cops. And don't say cops should count too.... because I know your other bullshit pro-gun arguments.
But you are right. Gun makers shouldn't be held financially responsible. They should be shut down. And fuck your "renewing the tree of liberty" bullshit too. Stop voting for tyrants and you won't have to worry about it. I'm all for the second amendment until I realize just how fucking stupid second amendment people are. I don't want them to have guns. I can tell from your post that you have shitty logic, and likely make bad choices. That's why I don't want you to have a gun.

I don't know what you're talking about yet, but what you said probably makes sense and I should probably seek help with my drinking habit.

You're just going to down vote me? That's it?
