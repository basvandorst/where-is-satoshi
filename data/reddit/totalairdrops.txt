Explained simply, what is Lightning Network and how does it work?!
@_date: 2019-01-27 02:49:54
Hahahaha you definitely don't trust the system at all...
@_date: 2019-01-28 01:30:07
This is then the situation of an independant country that is not seen by USA as their colony maybe. But when you have your old metropolis that creates a currency for you (different from their own) and decides that you use it, moreover they can mint it when and as they want then it's obvious that you're not in the same situation than Ecuador...

Hahahaha too funny! Life has very good sense of humor...
@_date: 2019-01-28 15:00:47
Hahaha I don't know if you well read my post and understood my point but I just have a question to you (not related to any president legitimity) : do you imagine for example USA having their gold reserve in another country?!
Then depending on your answer to that, tell me how do you understand that Venezuela or whatever other independant and sovereign country has their money (gold) kept in another one? (I have some other questions though, but let's start with these ones first)
NOTE : I don't care Central Banks as long as each country is allowed to have their own!

Do you think France will accept its "colonies" operate this change as easily as a South American country can?!
@_date: 2019-01-31 06:53:16
Old British colonies experience more freedom and independence than French ones : even I can say most African countries in difficulty regarding foreign political and economic interference are the old French colonies! I  won't add more...

Wow I can't believe what I see : this was a serious hardworking team! Unfortunately the crypto wind can blow everything on his way, even the strongest...
@_date: 2019-01-29 17:50:29


It's obvious you know more what the situation is! But when all people access education about cryptocurrencies power I know these dark systems will definitely all lose control...

We are the mission to bring the LIGHT to those who still have their spirits in the financial darkness...
@_date: 2019-01-28 02:42:08
Let's say yes! Then what is the point you want to suggest in term of solution for African countries?! 
@_date: 2019-01-28 03:01:20
Where did you see that please?! I haven't understood it like that... but I'm willing to get up-to-date.
@_date: 2019-01-29 17:41:57
Yeah but Central Banks regulate things in most cases, so that it only occupies a very small part of economical life...

Let's see if he will buy some again...
@_date: 2019-01-28 15:11:10
Kindly enlighten my mind about how this process happens then...
@_date: 2019-01-28 10:31:12
Yeah because the trust within the "system" is no more existing... some people (and they are numerous) are ready for all, even to die in the Mediterranean Sea, to illegally enter Europe, this is the most important sign that describes this situation!
@_date: 2019-01-27 01:10:42
Nice teaching, will do the same but first I need a dog too... hahaha
@_date: 2019-01-30 13:17:33
Though you have to make a difference between old British colonies and old French colonies because the latter are not as free to do such things as the former...
@_date: 2019-01-30 13:20:44
Then you need to learn more about most African countries instability responsible... hahahaha
@_date: 2019-01-27 02:57:01
Hope that you've changed since that time... hahaha
@_date: 2019-01-28 01:24:47
I just talked about the visible part of the iceberg... but just understand that they don't hold their economy because they are still into a state of colony, while politically claimed to be independant!
Then in terms of solution I didn't propose they mint their own currency but to take advantage of Bitcoin that is a global decentralized system that can't be censored. Then no one can't be too weak to access it.
@_date: 2019-01-27 02:55:02
Hmmmm this woman... she might definitely be a cryptolover!
@_date: 2019-01-27 01:32:22
Am going to try this to see how much you hold on this account... hahaha
@_date: 2019-01-29 17:38:09
For sure bro, I will look for this book...
@_date: 2019-01-28 11:31:42
Exactly, well said! I tell people that thing every time I can...
@_date: 2019-01-28 17:38:23
Hahahaha he was murdered tho!
But I don't care dictators the less of the world, as long as populations can access a currency that allows an acceptable level of development... and I believe Bitcoin can make it possible!
@_date: 2019-01-28 11:21:33
Even this guy!!! I can't believe everybody wants to own the "holy" coin... hahahaha
@_date: 2019-01-28 15:42:56
Nice, now let's come back to the substance of my post! You may surely not agree with those who claim, having followed the Venezuelan situation, that if it's not your vault, then it's not your gold... or like we say in crypto "not your key, not your bitcoin".
But my point was that African countries, not really independant because of their economy held by other countries, must take advantage of blockchain revolution to get rid of those systems of subtle colonialism they are maintained in!
@_date: 2019-01-28 01:39:36
Interesting, but let's talk a bit about CFA Franc, do you know how it works?!
How can you explain that an independant country needs the old metropolis to interfere as an intermediary when you have commercial exchange with other countries of the world and keep the half of the money you earn by this as a vault?! Now when you need funds to achieve some development projects, instead of giving you that reserved money they "lend" you so that you pay back with interest... but at the end you never see the money they "save" for you!
@_date: 2019-01-28 10:25:42
Yeah it's always other countries that are to be moralized by them... even if Maduro leaves for Guaidó and the latter asks them to return the country's gold they won't accept to do so, this is like that "their cooperation system" works; exactly like the banking system!
@_date: 2019-01-27 23:09:42
Someone recently said that we don't build businesses on top of Bitcoin, we rather build economies on top of it so let African try it...
