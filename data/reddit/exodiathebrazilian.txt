citing those fringe authors wont get you anywhere, buddy
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:29:33
Haha, the joke is funny because that is not real economics
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:30:47
There's no such thing as an austrian "economist".

I, for one, think that's great. We are transfering resources from poor allocators, like these bitcoin fanatics, to people with some skill to put those resources to good use. It's the market correcting itself
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:26:30
That's great fellow bitcoiner! I encourage you to mortgage some of your assets (like your house, since it does not appreciate like bitcoin does) and buy more when it hits a bottom. It will definitely be worth 25k by 2Q of 18

This comment is gold. Like, literally gold. A wonderful store of stupidity

Please do. There's a demand for foolishness in the marketplace and you guys do a great service providing it in the form of liquidity for bullshit assets like bitcoin
@_date: 2018-11-22 23:32:22
Thing is: you're not succeding at it at all. But for one to fall for bitcoin, one must be already used to failure

Adoption is not coming fam. But keep hodling, i need to keep laughing at you guys

You couldn't satisfactorily refute his claim. I guess the truth sank in, hm?
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:25:26
Because he's a fool
@_date: 2018-11-23 14:49:31
There's no need to be so triggered
@_date: 2018-11-23 15:51:21


Bullshit. Bitcoin is bullshit. I would also define it as a scam. Beanie babies for IT type guys is also a good description
@_date: 2018-11-23 01:11:40
sure, mate
@_date: 2018-11-22 23:36:28
Don't worry. It won't change anything. You guys were always the laughing stock of the family, anyway
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:38:45
Lol, everytime this same excuse. Even when it's not holidays season
@_date: 2018-11-22 23:29:00
So please, buy the "dip". There's a lot of people trying to get out of the bitcoin scam right now. If you provide liquidity to the market, maybe they will exit at a slightly better price.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:20:00
Stop being dumb
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:38:31
I strongly encourage bitcoin enthusiasts to buy more right now. It'll be best if their assets are handled by someone else
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:40:45
Hahahaha. That's gold. There's even a non-ironical "bankster" in there
@_date: 2017-09-22 20:53:17
Hahahahah. You guys act like a cult
@_date: 2017-09-22 20:51:49
Bitcoin and efficiency in the same sentence...
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:27:28
You should mortgage your house and "invest" in crypto
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:31:07
Tragic? I think it's actually entertaining. Schadenfreude 
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:37:30
You should invest in companies that make tinfoil instead
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:30:09
i really hope you do
@_date: 2018-11-22 23:33:47
Yeah! But less useful and valuable
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:19:23
You deserved it
