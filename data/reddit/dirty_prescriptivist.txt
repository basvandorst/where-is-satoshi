Are there any sites or applications that you gave a Mintpal API key/secret?

On 99.9% of websites you can trivially determined whether a given email address is registered there with various tricks related to login/signup/pw reset flows. This has the added advantage of gleaning the information without alerting the mark.
In Coinbase's case the sign up page, if filled out with an email and no password, will redirect to 'sign in' if the email is registered and otherwise fail since you didn't enter a password.
At this point, you have a few options to determine their real name. Most people won't have bothered to hide it well, since you have an email address and username (from the hacked DB you're using), you could probably just Google the combination and find a name trivially. On the other hand, most people use webmail, Gmail being the most popular. 
So, did you know that Gmail will give you the real name of anyone using the service? [Here's an example]( pulled from the email list OP was using.
I hope this post sufficiently illustrates that the Internet is a very leaky place when it comes to basic personal information. Omission doesn't mean other options are better, just that I either haven't looked at them or don't care to write them up.

Your key is still on your computer. 
Non-ELI5: the filesystem has a lookup table for files, and "delete" only removes the pointer in that table.
ELI5 version because I'm bored:
Imagine your hard drive is a big room full of small, numbered, boxes. You put your data in one of them. Now, how do you find that data later? You keep a notebook with box numbers and a description of what you put in it.
At this point, there are two ways to get rid of that data: you can go open that box, pull everything out, and shred it - but this takes a while to do, and what if you *really really* need that data later on? The easier method is just to cross it out in your notebook, and shred it later on when you need to put something else in the box.
In most cases this is the right thing to do, because it's much more common for someone to accidentally delete a file 'permanently' than to actually want to. So if you actually want to erase a file permanently, you need a tool like `shred` (Linux) or CCleaner (Windows, there are probably better, but it works).
CCleaner also has [a tool to wipe all free space on your hard drive]( which might be what you're looking for at this point.

Yup, exactly. A list of where to find the actual content of the files.

I do agree on Blockchain.info.

Yes, it's an HYIP.

An unknown miner with high hashrate (judging from the 200 BTC number) was intentionally wasting work on Eligius and BTCGuild ( and  by blocks solved), resulting in lower returns for the honest pool participants.

Very good point, I hadn't even thought of SSDs in this case.

People should weigh these options very carefully. As someone who has helped numerous friends and family clean up their virus/spyware/adware ridden computers, I would *not* advocate them storing Bitcoin on their computers.
It's certainly possible to store them more securely on your PC, but this requires a level of technical skill far beyond average. An honest assessment of whether you or Coinbase is more likely to have a security breach is the best option, and if you're using Windows I think it is heavily weighted in Coinbases's favour.
For long term storage, properly done cold storage is by far your best option - here I'm assuming it isn't an option. Pragmatically, many people won't consider it, because of complexity and other reasons.

Looks like the HTTPS link is broken on mobile, [use this instead.](
I blame HTTPS Everywhere. Very useful addon but unfortunately causes occasional issues like this.
