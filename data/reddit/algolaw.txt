Lol, go code OSS bullshit for Simon Boy.
@_date: 2017-03-16 13:32:10
He has recently stated (to those close to him within firms he has invested in) to have dumped large amounts under the $1000 level.  
@_date: 2017-03-05 08:06:37
He is no longer hodliing important amounts contrary to what he claims.
@_date: 2017-03-30 12:12:39
Roger dumped his holdings at 950, back in January. He can't do shit.
@_date: 2017-03-04 12:24:45
Roger claims to be hodling important sums of btc but he just bailed on a huge chunk very recently. He's full of shit.
@_date: 2017-01-27 12:48:20
Haha, dig the Samourai Wallet logo.
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:37:08
Despite being in the bitcoin space almost from the beginning (unlike their lying CEO who likes to brag internally that he is employee number zero) blockchain.info block explorer chokes on coinbase and op_returns. They refuse to evolve. Call Jade. She'll sort it out.
@_date: 2017-01-27 12:50:45
Zero KYC? Bullshit. They are into KYC now and with an office in New York City it can only get worse. Avoid.
@_date: 2017-01-04 08:20:08
Given his recent increasingly unhinged comments, and given the way he his openly doing everything possible to break bitcoin, he obviously has nowhere near the amount he once had or claims to have.
@_date: 2017-01-27 12:49:53
Blockchain.info has a long and sorry history of fuckups. Too long to mention. Avoid them.
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:25:00
North Korea? Lol, you talk like that shithead Twatter now? Probably a sock puppet of yours.
@_date: 2016-12-20 11:05:03
Avoid blockchain.info at all costs. Long history of screw ups and contrary to whatever they may claim, it's not getting any better. Toxic.
@_date: 2016-12-18 15:09:11
LOL. Stay way. Just say NO to bc.i
@_date: 2017-04-22 22:39:20
You sold those scammy tokens.
@_date: 2017-04-22 22:37:55
Not only have Mycelium become pay pigs for KYC, they are a scam wallet with their token sale.
@_date: 2017-09-09 08:25:27
Funny thing, that. When bitcoin-js integrated Segwit, everyone just assumed that bc.i was up-to-speed w/ Segwit and it appeared on all the lists of companies/wallets that were segwit-ready. That, despite the fact that the CEO, Simon Peter, declared that segwit support was very much undecided. Search for the word segwit in their github repo: 0 occurrences. Looks like they haven't started on anything at all as of yet. Not surprising as they never adopted P2SH, unless you count the numbers guy they hired who also runs a P2SH stats site.
@_date: 2017-09-09 08:23:20
Working on better solution. Check. Mycelium sucks.
@_date: 2017-09-25 16:32:13
There is nothing in their repo that would suggest that they are even looking at Segwit. All their latest dev is around ETH and KYC/AML.
@_date: 2017-09-16 12:21:08
They got some German mop-haired dude supposedly working on Thunder which started out as a tinker-toy play thing. Always was a half-hearted effort. Simon Peter's way of staying relevant. Expect bc.i to go all out BCASH anyway (re: BitPay).
@_date: 2017-09-08 08:22:59
Mycelium sucks at every level. Bullshit licensing just to start off. Now on to Russian scam tokens. WTAF. Biggest let-down in the space has been Mycelium. No contest.
@_date: 2018-07-01 12:39:39
Says an arch-scammer directly involved in one of the shadier token issues in recent crypto history.
@_date: 2018-07-03 07:16:52
Right. You're toast.
@_date: 2017-05-12 09:40:29
Be very careful with them. They fuck up at every single turn and ultimately blame the user. Fact is, they are custodial without admitting as much. Once they keep your coins, it's your fault. They suck. 
@_date: 2017-05-03 08:12:36
Time to call that Jade chick. Maybe she can sort it out.
@_date: 2017-05-05 03:46:52
They have a broad called Jade that creates fake accounts so as to make 5 star reviews.
@_date: 2017-05-04 08:43:48
I seen that chick's haircut. The gender question is left open.
@_date: 2017-05-12 09:28:29
That Jade chick is clueless. It's a rip-off outfit.
@_date: 2017-05-04 08:41:40
Blockchain.info wallet is perfectly reliable. When it breaks, just contact that Jade chick at support and she will put you on the "pay no mind" list. Sorry for your loss!
@_date: 2017-07-27 08:44:27
Roger has zero BTC. He dumped back in Jan at 950. So when he says that he has as many BTC as BCC, yes -- it's a joke, but not they way he wants everyone to interpret it.
@_date: 2017-05-12 09:30:24
You should report them to the proper authorities.
@_date: 2017-07-16 18:56:38
Blockchain.info has publicly backed Segwit2x, notably via an incredibly condescending segwit2x dev list message from Simon Peter Smith to A. Back, so expect them to hard fork at the announced 3 -month deadline. They have signed up for every single consensus-breaking scheme: XT, Classic, BU and now 2x. Don't leave your coins there.
@_date: 2017-07-26 07:48:28
Did you secure your recovery phrase? This has little to do with 2FA. Why are you blaming the app provider for your negligence? This isn't some SnapChat-like app  where you can get your password changed.
@_date: 2017-06-06 07:19:57
All the scam token funds were burned paying tribute to 's furry findom friend.
@_date: 2017-06-03 11:51:58
You *really* need to get in contact with Bc.i 's lead dev cum CTO, M.Tuzzolo. They have left far too many users of their legacy wallet hanging.
