I also think paying your taxes would be the best option.

They're safe, I've bought and sold and received money on there. They also have a reddit account that they use to answer at times too.

Wait a day or two until futures settle would be your safest choice. But the r/bitcoin way is to tell you to buy and hold for a lambo at every opportunity so, your choice.

You'll send your BTC to an exchange, such as coinbase/gdax, then from there it should give you a few options to withdraw, such as etransfer, wire, direct transfer to your bank account, depending on the option it could take a few days.

I traded on there for a few months before verifying, I got verified within an hour or two, that was this month. Verify first before depositing because a lot of people are having issues, it's hit or miss it looks like.

I care less than both of you ever could combined.

I wouldn't say it's the worst advice but I think it'd be foolish to buy back in, or buy more right now. Buying in now would be FOMO. Better to be safe and wait a day or two at the risk of maybe a thousand dollars profit vs more loss. If bitcoin is what it is, it will more than 10x and I don't think a thousand is worth worrying about it while you sleep.
