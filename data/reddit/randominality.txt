Ah, hadn't really thought about your last point. That is actually very valid, but it does require an amount of pre-planning that is not necessary with fiat transfer methods.
Additionally, I definitely can't think of a way of making a quick anonymous transfer from fiat to fiat via BTC.

One year from now I would like to buy myself lunch. If I have $10 now, what is the chance I can buy lunch with it next year? If I have 0.05 BTC now, what is the chance I can buy myself lunch next year?
Both are currencies, but due to the way each is run and where each is positioned in the world, the answer to the question of long term worth is different, at least at the moment.

What is the merit to the person buying in this situation? You're not really avoiding the fees that bitcoin helps you avoid because you have to do a conversion from fiat that costs money.

But the whole point is that with the current volatility, one doesn't really want to store a chunk of savings as BTC. Therefore to do this kind momentary transfer from fiat to BTC in order to make a BTC transaction you have to wait for the fiat to be transferred to an exchange first. It's definitely not instant in this case.

I think there were plenty of reasonable arguments posited which implied it might not have been a bubble. The reason lots of people were optimistic about it was not because they were greedy or stupid, they simply saw the logic of those reasonable claims and decided to believe in them and take the risk that their belief was correct. 
As someone who sold almost all their bitcoins one month ago when there was an all-time high of $35 I'm kicking myself for not believing the optimism I'd read at the time. Now that the price has corrected/crashed it's still well above where I got scared and thought a crash was incoming. There are logical reasons for this too.
When the waters are as uncharted as they are with bitcoin, it essentially comes down to gambling, except one can only make vague guesses at the odds. One person can back up their guess with logic and reason and another who believes the opposite will be able to come up with equally logical reasons for their opposition: no one truly knows what will actually be important and what will not be in determining the price of bitcoin because it *is* a new paradigm, whether it is successful or not.

It's more akin to someone giving out free oranges just in front of a market stall trying to sell oranges.
