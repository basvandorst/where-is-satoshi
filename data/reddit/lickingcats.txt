Just today I found a wallet.dat on my drive and I threw it into the bitcoin client. It said that I had 150 BTC input in October 2013, and two unconfirmed transactions of ~75 BTC output in September 2013.
So naturally I was very interested in this because even back in 2013 that was about $20k and I don't remember having that much.
I had a bit of a moment, thinking that somehow I misplaced Right Now Retirement Money. But it was just LTC.
@_date: 2019-07-30 04:26:29
Yeah but most likely I moved that 150 LTC to an exchange and sold out. I looked up the addresses on the blockchain search sites and they all show zero, but also no transactions so it's a bit confusing.

That was the MtGox crypto winter. I know it was so long ago that it seems like ancient history but you can't examine that particular years long bear market without acknowledging the chilling effects of the crash of MtGox.
None of that is happening now, so it might move a lot faster.

I doubt that a miner would hold more than anyone else.
They need to pay for their costs and then take profit. I imagine most miners aren't your average bitcoin neckbeard, they're probably wanting to make money and they can't take chances with the market. 
Undoubtedly they'll keep some as bitcoin, as you say holding can really pay off but when the halving hits, I think it will increase the selling pressure because miners will have to sell double to meet costs.
So keep your pants on, the halving might not be what you think.

Multisig will protect your BTC from theft, but doesn't really help if someone is threatening to cave in your skull with a wrench.  Maybe they won't kill you but your dog, your girlfriend etc.  Girlfriends have lots of fingers, the baddies can snip off one knuckle at a time until they get what they want.
OP is being a bit of a bitch and sassing everyone offering warnings about this.  
The Internet is a nasty cesspool of awful people.  I stay away from it as much as possible.
Edit: I didn't realize that Robin Hood doesn't allow crypto withdrawal, they really are a pretty limited exchange.
I don't really agree with the approach OP has taken, because he could have just spent a little time to learn how to use a hardware wallet and put it in a bank vault. 
But I get it. You can't get the money out of Robin Hood easily, so it doesn't really matter how much the baddies want to get it.

Most of my friends who got interested in the past lost money in various crypto exchange exit scams, hacks, buy high sell low, etc.  They thought it was cool, didn't spend enough time to secure their own stuff (treated it like a bank), got burned and are now scared to get back in.
I have one friend who got into it though and he is my crypto hero, he found an old wallet from a while back when he was GPU mining some wierd alt-coin and....lo and behold it had increased in value to about $20k total for the wallet.  He sold it all and bought his wife a new car.

Right now is before Bitcoin was brought into the mainstream but maybe we have a different definition of what that means.
I mean really, probably most people in the developed world have at heard the word Bitcoin at least once at this point, but only a tiny fraction of people have had any real exposure to it.
Assuming 1 billion people live in the developed world, 1% of people in the developed world is 10 million people.  This subreddit has 1.2m subscribers (minus the bots, abandoned and duplicate accounts) so that accounts for 0.1%.  
That's just not a lot of people, it still looks like early days to me.

I guess I did get a little excited there, but I'm deliberately not replying to OP because despite the fact that I think he's an idiot, he's got enough people telling him that. 
But really this guy is pooh poohing the risk of letting the internet know he has $150k in bitcoin.
Having it stored on an exchange is no guarantee of security, because it is just one password away from being transferred permanently to another address. 
OP seems to think that a thief would try to sell the btc for cash on the exchange, which is absurd.  And just because his exchange is legendary for having slow fiat withdrawal times, I suspect that the crypto withdrawal times are very quick. It can be gone forever in the blink of an eye.

Better to qualify that feat, because as long as there was at least one device of any capacity mining bitcoin it would have reached this point at roughly the same time.  This would have happened even if the price was zero and everyone but academics forgot about it. 
The interesting thing is that it is still relevant after 10 years.

Everyone who bought and held at the top of each previous bubble, the worst possible time to buy has seen their portfolio increase tremendously.
You just need to have patience.  For those of us who watch the charts, it seems like we're just in the foothills of Bitcoin's next stretch upwards so I think you'll do okay.

We were still shaking off the spectre of MtGox back then, there's nothing so awful to hold out back this time.
Greed will bring the moon, it always does.

No kidding.
The requirement to compile a custom kernel, and each attendant driver is simply the biggest hurdle to wider Linux acceptance.
I mean you can't even connect a USB keyboard without first coding a driver in assembly language, using a custom soldered serial adapter.
These Linux nerds have the nerve, no the audacity to think that their OS can possibly compete with Microsoft. What folly.

If these bitcoins are from 2013/2014 it's unlikely they'll be in the form of a word-list. That system was only proposed in 2013, and it wasn't that common until later. 
In that era it was typical for people to use a software wallet like Electrum or Armory. Look for files on the drive with a name like "wallet.dat"
Also look for printed wallets among his paper files, they'll look like two long random words, and often two QR codes.

It looked to me like 1400 moved during that time frame but probably not all at that price, it would have walked down the buy order book.
@_date: 2019-12-05 18:46:28
I agree.  There's no need for this gatekeeping bullshit.
But that said, there is nothing in the subreddit rules or guidelines that even come close to "don't be a dick" so there you go.

No kidding.  And people pooh-pooh the idea that they have to keep their 1 BTC a secret but one day it won't be worth just $7.5k or whatever it is right now.  
One day it may potentially be worth much more, and having someone know that you've got more than $100k or $1M in easily and irreversibly transmitted value would be reason to worry.
So start your opsec now.

No kidding. 21 BTC is a great place to be, but it's not whale territory.
I reckon a whale is someone who has so much BTC they can fearlessly engage the market. 21 BTC is not even retirement money (right now) so you'd be crazy to do anything but hold, and maybe attempt simple market bets.

We've seen this before.
The miners will have to sell off their reserves to pay for expenses, and some of them will fail during the next bear market.
I think any rise you're going to see is on the lead up, as the event gets 'priced in'.

So I just spent half an hour combing through my email, and I've pieced together a pretty good picture - better than I thought I'd be able to.
I did a bunch of alt-coin mining in 2013.  I probably didn't have my own BTC wallet at the time, or maybe I did but it looks like in 2013 I withdrew 1/4 of my stack from BTC-E.  Great - the king of money laundering exchanges.  I think I remember attempting to make a few salient trades there.  But that was in 2013.
In 2014 a bunch of more legitimate exchanges were popping up and I didn't ever touch btc-e again.  In 2014 I sold off my mining rigs and started just straight up buying BTC, which makes this a LOT easier.  
Altogether I'm able to identify 3/4 of my stack now including the sketchy btc-e stuff.  There's still the mystery of the last 25% but I've made an attempt at least.
@_date: 2019-05-30 18:14:51
For now. It's a bit of a moving target.
@_date: 2019-05-16 01:04:34
Thanks that's pretty sensible. I'll see what I can figure out.
