My account has the btc I bought... I'm not a shill.. lol no one would want this account to shill with.

From what I've gathered it seems like BFL uses the machine you purchased to mine enough btc to make a profit and then sends you your used product months later when it has become way too inefficient to mine a profit... correct?

basic business: The higher the risk the higher the reward... $10 won't make you any money at all if you consider inflation

one time it took 10 days for me to receive 14 btc... this is due to the large influx of orders they have received, they WILL honor your ticket. Guaranteed 
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:49:23
I am very chill, thanks for noticing :)
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:12:48
I think they are a great company with a surge of new accounts that they were not expecting.. kinda like how everyone wasn't expecting btc to be at 300$ today :/
@_date: 2013-05-24 22:22:44
can you help me through the steps?... I'm new to bitcoin and encrypted data (PGP)
@_date: 2013-11-03 18:19:44
I'd give you gold, but I'm too afraid of opportunity cost 
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:45:46
honestly I don't believe btc will ever become a major currency due to government interference (china is an example).. but I do plan on making money in the speculation process like I already have.
@_date: 2013-12-11 05:14:32
what happens if a new OS comes out?... ignore it?

COINBASE is a good company with a large influx of unexpected customers.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:32:31
downvoted for being as gullible or a troll.. did you call chase directly or read from a non confirmed source?
@_date: 2013-05-17 19:58:16
how do you know how much % SR traffics? 
@_date: 2013-05-03 18:41:54
i just bought 5 more btc through Coinbase... btc value WILL be at $172.57 on 5/26/13 ;)
@_date: 2013-05-24 04:03:16
is it worth a try? 
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:28:52
or $15,000 ... hence high risk high reward 
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:19:54
all I read was PANIC SELL
@_date: 2013-05-09 23:59:37

BREAKING: someone hates Coinbase only to find out they love Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:47:23
I want btc to work I really do, but I see government involvement / lost btc wallets / over estimates of its price being its downfall.. BUT I can guarantee that you can make A LOT of money in the process 
@_date: 2013-11-01 03:40:37
wondering if this is why my coins haven't showed up yet in my wallet after the estimated time frame :/ 
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:10:41
SELL SELL SELL.. so i can BUY BUY BUY !!
@_date: 2013-12-10 13:56:09
I can't live without my iphone and coinbase app

Invest $25 a day and talk to me in a year. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 14:22:09
potential customer loss would be even greater than what they are doing now with that approach.
@_date: 2013-10-24 20:01:29
question of the day
@_date: 2013-11-06 17:00:19
they have failed to make an impression on me..
@_date: 2013-05-24 20:01:29
I know I'm just really nervous about the quantity I have in it
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:11:57
GREAT !
@_date: 2013-05-17 17:14:50
Bitcoins = internet money |
SR = drugs |
drugs + internet money = demand |
high Demand = low supply |
low supply = increased value |
Conclusion... price keeps rising 
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:47:57
nope, I'm just excited about the amount of money I am making daily through their services  
@_date: 2013-06-09 20:22:44
LOL i just bought 3 more BTC !! 
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:48:11
it has to do with your bank transfer... contact coinbase, they will honor the original ticket as long as your bank doesn't fall through again :)
@_date: 2013-12-22 05:34:40
SR2 admins that were compromised from SR1 information stolen/confessed from DRP (ross)  
@_date: 2013-11-01 03:29:24
sometimes it takes longer than the expected time for my bitcoins to arrive, but i can't really complain because they do provide a user friendly service that is directly linked to my bank 
@_date: 2013-05-15 02:10:24
coinbase is gold 
@_date: 2013-11-01 13:54:43
they don't suck 
@_date: 2013-03-07 05:10:00

@_date: 2013-12-16 22:47:44
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:18:45
