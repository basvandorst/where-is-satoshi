Funny the graphs show no history of it being around $8K.

Considering it was there. Why doesn’t it show the spike on the graph? It clearly was there. 
[more proof]( 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:06:02
No, I said it’s strange that it doesn’t show up on Coinbase that it ever happened. Almost as if they don’t want it to show up or at least they don’t want the history of it happening to be there. 
It showed up for a bit and now it’s gone. Go on the coinbase app and the graph will not show it happened. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:43:25
Well it’s not on the coinbase app. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:31:40
Weird? No. Clearly Coinbase did some shady shit. 
Fuck them.

The idea of HODL is stupid. When the price is going up fast, it’s a sign that it’s time to sell. When it went to about 400, that was the time to sell. 
But many of you didn’t. My brother did and made a lot of profit after buying at around $50. 
Everyone knows if it rises too fast, it will go down quickly soon after. Now it’s been around $130 for a while now, and everyone who sold at $400 is pleasant and happy they can buy more at a low price. 
If the price rises suddenly, it’s time to sell, not hold. The price isn’t going to keep going up for days on end continuously.

And not a great year for crypto. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 09:14:10
Because they’ve been going down and staying down this whole year. That’s why I say that. They’ve gone down is my point. And they haven’t gone up again. I’m not comparing it to last year or 2 years ago. I’m simply stating what has happened: they have gone down and staying around it.

I care more about looks than speed. A Lamborghini attracts attention. A Tesla? Not on the same level. 
Also, yes a Tesla will accelerate to 60 faster, but a Lamborghini will surpass it over time. The Tesla is first for a few seconds.
Regardless, I’m not a fan of the way Tesla’s look. I don’t think their model S looks good on the outside for $70,000. Besides the front, the rest looks like a subpar sedan. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 22:01:09
Nah. Tesla’s don’t have a nice design for their price.

If a crisis occurred, wouldn’t people pull their bitcoin savings because they need the money? Is there past proof that bitcoin buyers have been safe from financial crisis?

These kind of posts always use appeal to authority fallacies. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 03:25:49
I doubt it. Price goes up when people buy. I doubt majority of people will buy any of it when it’s price goes over $100,000. 
As the price goes up, less people will be able to buy it or buy enough of it to really matter.

I really hate these posts. Comparing something as volatile as bitcoin, which went from $19,000 down to $9000 in like a week. Even the stock market doesn’t behave like that as far as I know. 
If bitcoin rises, bitcoin holders will say, we told you so!
If bitcoin falls down and stay there forever, bitcoin holders wont say anything.

If he’s under 18? He would’ve been around 12 when he spent about $42,000 on Apple stock.

\&gt;it doesn't really change if its worth buying or using.
Some people can afford $10,000. Even spending $1,000 gets you 1/10th of a bitcoin. If the price was $100,000 or higher, $1,000 can get you 1/100th or less. It's not even really worth getting at this point or if it's higher. You won't be able to afford much of it to make a difference for you. Only the rich will benefit. This isn't an abstract wall. It's reality: how many people do you that can afford $10,000 for it? How about $100,000 and up?
I don't think it will ever go up to $1,000,000. You'd have to have A LOT of big ballers buying and selling to get to that point. Heck, I don't think it will go to $100,000 at all.

Can you show me where in the law it says it doesn’t apply if there is a major crisis and can you show me where “major crisis” is defined in the law?
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:47:31
No I’m not. I’m being logical. And the fact that you dismissed my previous comment goes to show how you think. 
It’s illogical and a fallacy to say: people said X was going to fail, but X succeeded, therefore, Y will succeed too because they say Y will fail.
It’s a fallacy.
I actually own crypto but that line of thinking isn’t valid.
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:30:27
Your title is a fallacy. Sure you don’t like it when people say that, but you can’t attribute the success of something similar to support your argument.
@_date: 2018-03-23 03:11:22
Of course it’s no different. You’re an idiot whichever you did.

Their savings wiped out? How many people have more than $250,000 in cash? The law protects people’s savings in banks up to $250,000. So a crisis wouldn’t be wiping anybodies savings. 
Now if you meant their investment in stocks, etc. Sure they’ll lose value. I don’t know much of the history of bitcoin value but if there is a financial crisis, people holding bitcoin might need the cash and sell their coins, thus dropping the price.
I didn’t say it isn’t worth buying at $100,000. I’m saying majority of people wouldn’t be able to afford it at all. They wouldn’t even be able to afford much of a portion to make any significant different. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:52:59
You’re right and my initial comment is wrong, but once OP replied, I can see he does believe that.

I’m an iOS developer. Not using a storyboard is not a sign of an amateur. It’s a sign of an experienced developer. Professionals mostly don’t use storyboards because they rather do the design in code instead to make working with teams easier (merge conflicts). Not only would they have to code the entire design, they also have to code the constraints/sizes that keeps elements appearing correct on all devices. 
Making an app using storyboards is wayyyy easier and this is basically taught everywhere you try to learn iOS. So the writer is surprised this self taught developer didn’t use storyboards. Still not proof though. They could’ve easily learned to make the designs/constrains all in code. I don’t know how long they took for this app but it’s plausible that a first time developer didn’t use storyboards if they have built previous personal projects without them.
Although after she confirmed like 95% wasn’t written by her, then it stands to believe she didn’t code the design. Heck, I’m a professional software engineer at a big bank app and we use storyboards rather than code the design cause it can take a while.

This was all you had to say to my first comment instead of attacking my character. Lol
Current crypto has no real use outside the fact that some who own it are only in it to make more money, and those who believe in it, are holding it and not buying anything with it. 
In the future, most people won’t be able to afford any of these coins because they’ll be too expensive. What good is that? Cryptos fluctuate way too much to really be useful enough to replace current currency. 
Maybe in the future where we have a stable coin with of course the amazing block chain technology, but these coins right now that are pure speculation? Just to make more money.

Changing the topic of an argument by using personal attacks. You’re not good at arguing. 
I bought LTC around $60-$70. I don’t remember. I’m not bitter about anything. It’s money I can afford to lose. If you see my history, you’ll see I’m a software engineer. I make enough to lose. I don’t mind dips.
