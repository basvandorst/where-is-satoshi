I was always curious to write a quick program to create wallets using 24 random words and check to see if the new "wallet" has any bitcoins in it.
Didn't know about the 24th word being a checksum though, and now I'm too lazy to look at the source to make it work. :(
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:02:55
I just tell them I'm only in it to cash out some time this year.
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:40:23
Pedo. Remember, I called it first.
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:39:39
Or you could, you know, just write down your buys and sells and calculate your gains in Excel. Or with a calculator.
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:00:48
Yes, let's all stop using computers and go back to sticks and stones. FFS neckbeards.
My bitcoins are in Electrum. Come and get them if you 1337 hackers are so awesome.
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:38:52
crypto-man ? wow
@_date: 2018-01-03 14:39:00
I just sent a bunch of bitcoins and paid around $9... took about an hour. So it's not really that bad right now.
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:58:31
Well if you're at 2/6 you already passed the hard part, getting onto the chain in the first place. Now you just need to wait for 4 blocks, which is *usually* 10 minutes per.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:10:13
still not seeing the "bubble" wtf do you have downs syndrome?
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:45:56


There's a sub on XVideos for that shit. It's pretty nasty.
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:25:06
I bought a pile at 10k and another pile *almost* at 9k, so essentially I won. The "Bears" can blow me.
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:44:54
LOL my accountant/tax lawyer was the one that called when a seven-figure deposit hit our savings account last November. He's like please tell me you didn't just tell north korea how to build a nuke or something.
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:54:41
The funny thing is (at least in the stock market) technical analysis works because a lot of the big money player believe it works. They see the "Double golden balls and shaft" pattern and immediately buy/sell/whatever. The chart becomes self-fulfilling.
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:41:26
My wife doesn't give a flying fuck about Bitcoin. She wants to know one thin:, when I do the final cash-out and how big the check will be.
Pretty much all of my friends are the same way.
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:43:03
I'm making an effort to only check once in the morning and once at night. The $1000 per hour swings were starting to make my body hurt.
@_date: 2018-01-03 03:25:04
No legit broker in the world is going to let you trade Bitcoin. That maayyybe will change when Goldman rolls out their exchange later in 2018 but I wouldn't count on it.
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:36:50
Charts don't mean shit.
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:50:10


LOL! Down here in the US we lost that about 15-20 years ago.
@_date: 2018-01-03 14:41:15
Fees are never going to go down to something reasonable until something is fixed. Probably in code, like a hard cap or whatever.
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:47:47
After almost 2 months I finally got "verified" at Gemini. I'll have to look up my login/password and redownload the 2fa app to see if they're actually worth using now.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:45:50
There is no hedge. All or nothing motherfucker.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:59:37
Screwed how? I'm not in the BCH game at all, and Bitcoin is now back to where it was all day. $17,000-ish.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:45:20
I'd love to use Gemini, they're just so... smelly. I may have to get over it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:47:04
I'm not taking shit this weekend.
I *AM* however placing a bunch of buys at 12k, 11k, 10k... who knows? If the thing dives I'll get a pile of BTC for 50% off.
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:40:04
I love how they say this comes from an "analyst" like anybody on fucking Wall Street knows anything about Bitcoin.
Might want to see who this "analyst" works for first... Goldman? Wells Fargo? Bitcash?
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:11:12
I use CapOne for Coinbase, GDAX, and Gemini. Send an email to support. Something must be wrong.

I wish there was a way I could contact this homo or challenge him directly on the air at CNBC.
Sell me $1 million worth of $5,000 Dec 2018 calls, right now. Since you obviously think they're worthless... 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:38:08
You'll get another chance tomorrow during/after the Senate vote. I just got in and out quickly today. Will repeat tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:29:38
You mean the Bitcoins are INSIDE THE COMPUTER?
Tell me your seed words and I'll recover your hard drive in about two minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:19:07
Honestly though $200 is like 8 minutes of holding.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:23:23
Yep. If I were to guess I think they're wiping historical data to make the various APIs run faster.
I don't think they're doing anything nefarious, it's just these guys are technically *WAY* over their heads in the deep end. Nobody at Coinbase seems to know shit about big data.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:17:37
The price went up and down more than a thousand dollars about forty times today. Just wait 30 minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:30:26
I got in and back out... in 25 minutes my bitcoins made more than I did today at work.
Makes a guy feel useless.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:33:23
Why would you need your computer to have your bitcoins? Just re-enter your keywords into a new wallet.
??? Smells like bullshit.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:50:23
in the what?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:04:55
You're fine. Actually Bitcoin is trading normally.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:58:02
Where are the mods?
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:25:32
I love the part where I sold and the price immediately went up $450. F-UUUUUUUU
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:27:36
LOL good question, it will probably cost you $45 to send it anywhere.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:18:45
... in March.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:01:56
It's not banks. It's these guys with fuck-tons of cash (my lawyer wife has several day-trader clients with more than $100mil in the bank) are waiting to play with this "new toy" when futures start.
Don't underestimate the damage this kind of money can do.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:05:00
This is most likely a large exchange moving BTC around their internal/customer wallets.
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:28:14
If they could point me to something I could trade WITHOUT risk, that would be great.
D E S I G N A T E D
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:56:26
Coins will all take a giant hit tomorrow as well when the Senate does their thing. One more buying opportunity there.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:42:30
*NEVER* do market orders. Besides having a fee, you're going to get fucked if a giant fluctuation happens. Always limit. Always.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:57:29
I wouldn't think any time soon. The last time I could check there was something like 25,000 coins on the "sell" line in the trade book and climbing. It's just blank now.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:06:52
Tell them to fuck off and switch banks tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:18:30
The CIA and or NSA would be contacting you almost immediately. So that's good or bad, depending on which way that goes.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:23:35
I got the last of my cash and BTC out yesterday. Feels good. Especially since my final ACH took like 8 days. Slow motherfuckers.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:22:32
Except, no.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:22:00

@_date: 2017-12-19 22:40:28
I saw a release (which I now can't find) that said basically stay tuned we'll be adding more coins soon.
That being said, I have a small pile of shitcoins (ether and litecoin) that basically aren't doing anything. I can't really see the point of them.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:37:43
After watching CNBC almost religiously for something like 20 years I'm getting really fucking close to never turning them on again. They need to stop giving this asshole air time.
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:37:30
Honestly, this year I found myself tuning out of MSNBC and CNBC. It sucks but I can't stand listening to their "news" any more.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:39:13
I don't worship either, but bitcoin cash is like Borders and Bitcoin is like Amazon. Google how that turned out.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:49:21
Trick question, there's literally no way I could move enough money into GDAX before the price went back to $12k.
But to answer, YES if BTC went to 1,000 I'd buy $100mil USD minimum.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:08:57
I tried Gemini and honestly it's no better. In fact their trading platform isn't as good.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:17:40
On the contrary, I'm acting as irresponsible as humanly possible with my Bitcoin money. The starting capital is already withdrawn, so I'm riding this lottery ticket as far as I can.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:53:13
0.19 coins is a pretty good stash, all things considered.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:10:18
In all honestly, I think at some point (not for a few years, of course) "Bitcoin" should become what is currently a Satoshi.
It's like splitting a stock. Nobody wants to pay $1,000,000 for one share of Amazon.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:27:43
People are butt-hurt they didn't sell shitcoin months ago when it was easy.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:24:31
I have more than 41 BTC. Do your worst.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:12:52
I got to "Bitcoin Jesus" and stopped reading. LOL he's just a dude who bought early. That makes me fucking Bitcoin Moses.
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:25:22
That's horseshit. Make the fees 3 Satoshis per transaction. If the miners don't like it, they can LEAVE. In 2 weeks, the difficulty adjusts itself down and we're back to normal operation.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:43:23
Nope, never let taxes decide a buy/sell decision. If you make a profit there will taxes. It's just a fact of life.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:23:55
What's going to happen with the trade freezes? Automatic 2 minute stop on a 10% swing and 5 minute stop on a 20% swing.
Futures trading is going to be halted like 75% of the day.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:09:41
I used to watch CNBC religiously but finally realized all of those talking heads don't really know anything.
It's just TALK TALK TALK TALK TALK TALK TALK.
Although the Money Bunnies were always fun to watch.
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:47:31
I didn't need to see this. :(
I've spent 10x what you have on KS stuff and most of it wasn't good.

I could sell my ETH but that's a pittance.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:59:46


You mean, like dropping straight to zero? The sell/buy ratio was about 10,000/1 last time I looked.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:26:04
They're really not. I'm losing every other packet from them so the graphs are basically glitching out.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:22:17
Some of us *cough cough* already build these for traders on Wall Street. Your salaries need to be in the $300k - $400k range if you expect to get programmers worth anything.
And no, we won't bother doing it for crypto. Stocks and currency is where the real money is at. You need lots of liquidity and fast infrastructure in the markets; way more than you can get in crypto currently.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:24:16
Anyone buying near the current (not trading) price is going to have ass-rage next week when it's $1,000.
Am I the only one that can see the 1000-1 sell-buy ratio stacking up?
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:46:40
Buffett also thought investing in tech was a bullshit idea, now he has tons of it... so ??? Yeah, do what you want.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:49:16
To many of my friends on Wall Street, insider trading isn't really illegal unless you get caught. They all talk to each other every damn day at lunch.
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:50:33
People still seem to think "I can't afford 1 bitcoin" not even realizing you can buy 0.00000001 of a bitcoin. (well, kinda)
Biggest mistake in Bitcoin, IMO.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:03:30
$8499 or so.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:12:43
"A while back" being like four years ago? How in the fuck did you get verified? Still waiting over here...
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:41:40
I blame the fucking San Diego Chargers.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:14:12
Step 3.
Don't ever put this info "in the cloud."
See: the fappening
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:38:28
It's worth at least $500k, maybe $2 million. So, no.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:10:57
LOL. Good luck actually transmitting and storing a 1TB block.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:52:53
Goldman could come up with $10 billion in a few days. I'm sure they won't have a problem "stocking up on Bitcoin."
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:52:31
1 Lambo. Or $385,000.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:41:55
You still need to guess the hash that produces a result starting in "00000000000-whatever" so yeah, it's either luck or brute force. There's no way around it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:32:49
Honestly, delete your dropbox app. You can't use your wallets without the password.
Then when you get home, reinstall DropBox.
Also, can you password protect your harddrive on boot-up? That would pretty much do it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:45:31
My office mate sold them for close to $8000 !  Damn.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:38:50
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:57:25
Yes, because I'm going to do exactly what "Wolf of Wall Street guy" tells me to do.  O_o
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:36:00
The bitcoins are IN THE COMPUTER?
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:50:18
Cap transaction fees at 2 Satoshis. Literally, cap it at 0.00000002. Done and done.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:49:41
FFS no! If you're "not in" currently, you *really* need to wait until Monday at this point.
I'm not being exclusive-y or anything. It's just between now and when futures start on Sunday, this thing could go to $5 or $125,000 or god knows where in-between.
As for the price differences between exchanges, this happens everywhere, stock markets included. I helped write a bot for a broker that exploited differences in the various markets for S&amp;P 500 stocks. Penny here, penny there... but do it 1,000 times a second and you're talking serious bank.
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:57:18
Al Capone's vault.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:00:25
With the way Bitcoin fluctuates, you can drive all the way home with the cops screaming behind you and still be able to pay the fines/bail no prob.
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:31:33
I am to forcing you poop in street much gain. Big moon, much wampum.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:39:14

@_date: 2017-12-20 04:00:56
I sold a few days after the fork and was just happy to get anything in exchange for shitcoins!
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:23:12
Yes that will happen O_o
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:23:09


Unfortunately that's way too low. I have around 1-2 bitcoins on GDAX at any given time.
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:53:30
OMG I would totally accept bitcoin as payment for coffee right now. That $5 cup costs around 75 cents so the risk is absolutely worth the payoff.
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:31:04
It's also a pretty shitty gift, overall. An Amazon card would be better.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:07:45
It's the "fuck me the database crashed" code. All orders are just post only right now. You can list 'em but there's no trading.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:17:33
Well, considering everyone's now predicting stock market insanity I'd say it's pretty safe there will be no "gold rally."
Also, when has gold ever affected Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:55:11
Lol, how's that going to happen, exactly?
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:18:15
I'm still mad about selling a pile at $2,000.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:06:54
Let's see if Jamie Dimon puts his money where his asshole is. My guess is he will not. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:35:43
You can pull your BTC out of coinbase the exact same way as gdax. Enter an address and wait. (and ... wait)
Are you seriously keeping 20k+ bitcoins at Coinbase? WTF dude!
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:11:56
These fuckers try to install some kind of keylogger every time I visit. Avast catches it though.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:43:30
Last week. The answer is always going to be "last week."
Realistically, "right-the-hell-now" is the next best answer. Just get in.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:11:31
The US will kill Bitcoin before it threatens to replace anything.
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:22:14


This one just isn't true. I have a $25,000 daily limit at GDAX and a $500 daily limit at Gemini.
Just sayin.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:27:34
Somebody should set up a big fucking mining operation on the moon. Or in orbit.
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:38:10
I have friends who bought thousands of shares of AAPL in 2002 for around $1.10 a share.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:32:23
Except when there's no regulation there's literally no such thing as "insider trading."
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:29:28
Technology aside, for that you'd literally say "on Tuesday, everyone holding 1 BTC now owns 10,000 BTC."
This happens to stock almost every week somewhere.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:19:26
The big problem is you need an alternative. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:23:59
Just a minor nitpic, but how is a solar flare going to wipe out your private key? Just get a $500 computer and you're back in.  ???
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:20:40
This is why regulation needs to happen. Soon. Without it, Coinbase is going to end up fucking a lot people at some point.
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:11:58
Take a play from their book and call it "bitcoin cash" then go on tour everywhere calling yours the Official version.
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:36:55
The worst part of the whole fucking thing is nobody should be "investing" in Bitcoin. It shouldn't even be talked about like that. But hey... stupid people are stupid.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:08:32
Except, no. BTC is just rising to its expected price.
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:09:43
I can see most of the planet saying "I use PayPal to buy stuff, so it's totally a currency."
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:21:57
I've never seen $5 look so dirty.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:27:00
There was 0 "try" involved. They said it, and that's the end.
If you think about it, there's no way any part of the government can legitimize BTC. It just undermines the dollar.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:01:45
That's why you never do market orders. Never.
Also, that's why you never do market orders. The only people who lost money were stupid people. So who cares?
Also, Gdax charges like $25 for 'em, so WTF.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:24:40
That's a market issue. Gdax has way more volume. One thing that really annoys me at Gemini (where I now live) is that the spread is usually $5-$10 and sometimes like $25.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:53:31
I tried to score some bitcoin at 14,000 but I didn't get lucky.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:03:41
That's by transaction volume. Coinbase doesn't support it, so therefore you're never getting past 10%.
As far as I know Gemini doesn't either. It's hard to get any actual information from that web site.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:18:20
This is actually quite awesome. Best case: you're a millionaire. Worst case: you didn't smoke.
For an added twist, don't tell you kids about it. In your will, simply list your seed words with zero explanation of what they're for. If they're smart enough, they'll be able to cash in.
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:49:28
Given a CIA link I immediately went to Wiki to make sure the CIA wasn't just making the place up.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:59:15
I bought Amazon at $2 so ultimately that didn't seem to matter very much.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:30:40
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:50:30
I hate how fucking long it takes to move cash and coins to and from them. Otherwise I was happy with the Gdax interface, etc.
Plus now, after this Shitcoin thing, I just don't trust them very much.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:14:16
You love it!

They make so much money from trades, more so at Gemini because they charge even for limit trades, that I'm sure they have no problem paying the network xfer fees.
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:35:08
wut? When in the FUCK was Bitcoin $15? Like 2011?
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:42:20
19,500. Or 21,200. Or 9,840.
One of those.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:28:54
If you sold 100% of your stake going from $2300 to $19400 then you are a moron.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:17:14
ETF's are simple. A group will have a giant pile of bitcoins, then sell shares that act exactly like stock. My *guess* is they'll do something like 1 share equals 1/100th or 1/1000th of a bitcoin, just to make them liquid. You can now buy or sell the bitcoin ETF without having to deal with Coinbase, etc.
GLD is a Gold ETF that you can use for an example. 1 share of GLD represents 1/10th of an ounce of gold. (approximately)
Futures are a little more complicated. That's gambling on what you think the price of bitcoin is going to be at some month in the future. If you're asking a ELI5, don't worry about futures.

Just hold tight. They are having big time troubles with scaling. BTC transfers in and out are also taking forever. pulled BTC out of GDAX about 3 hours ago and it hasn't even hit the blockchain yet.

@_date: 2017-12-21 03:48:07
Honestly, it's because nobody at CNBC has any idea what he's even talking about. Even Cramer is clueless about this stuff. It's painful to watch.

@_date: 2017-12-20 22:41:44
They seem to have a lot of hardware behind them. But I don't really like the interface and their fees are high.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:15:44
You're not even close. I just read an article saying people are taking money out of their mortgages to buy BTC. *THAT'S* stupid.
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:42:37

@_date: 2017-12-20 02:04:23
Perfectly said. There's going to be 1.2 million on the sell line by the time this is done. Everyone said "oh fuck yeah free cash!" and immediately clicked "sell at market"

Double spend them, immediately. Put a high fee on it to get it on the blockchain.

There is no "fast" with GDax, take whichever has the lowest fees. e.g. ACH is free.

Although the current spread on Bitcoin is around $58... what the fuck is up with that? It should be a penny.

@_date: 2017-12-20 02:02:42
Also, the "sell" line at GDAX has grown to 4,150 Bitcash against around 70 "buy".

The settlement is in cash, based on the price of the future when it's closed. Nothing more, nothing less. If you made $100, great; if you lost $100, great.
Although with Bitcoin and the futures multiplier (whatever it may be, I don't care enough to look) it will be thousands and not $100.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:22:15

It's the long way around, but it's easier on your brain to sell LTC for cash first, then do the BTC transaction.
Also, never NEVER use market orders! For fuck sake, you're going to get robbed at some point, and not just because there's a fee. Those $1,000 price swings are almost instant one time it will completely fuck you.

The Fed couldn't do this. The SEC or Congress could. They simply have to make it illegal for banks to move money to BTC exchanges. Google "online poker in USA" to see how this works.

This is uniquely the worst decision made in Bitcoin.
Almost every person I talk to has no idea there is a such thing as 0.0001 of a bitcoin. They're all thinking of stocks and of course you can't buy 1/10th of a share of Amazon. They just look at me with a blank stare... what do you mean... a part of a bitcoin?
We nerds tend to forget that 90% of the planet has no idea how math works, and they don't care to even learn. Some time soon, Bitcoin needs to adjust its base unit by a factor of 10,000 or more.
