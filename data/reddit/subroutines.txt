This is a line of credit extended to you by PayPal. If you do not make payments towards your balance, as outlined in their terms and conditions, they can report you to a credit bureau (e.g. Experian, TransUnion or Equifax), which will be a knock against you on your credit report. Why'd you think banks were the only institutions that could report you to credit bureaus?

Value in our economy is the purchasing power of the dollar, across a wide range of goods and services. The value of a company would be would be all the assets the company owns, which includes all the monetary wealth it currently has in banks and investments, along with assets ranging from machinery to intellectual properties to buildings to land, etc. It also includes the ability of that company to turn a profit. What I'm saying is that all those things of value (under whatever existential interpretation of value you are currently entertaining) have little to do with the current price people are willing to pay for a share of stock in that company. It's almost as if Tesla, the car company, and TSLA the stock, are two completely independent entities.

Hah, yeah, I see how that sounds like an oxymoron. To clarify, [common stock]( prices (e.g. [GOOG]( [TSLA]( are not directly tied to the actual value of a company (i.e. the company's current net worth, including all assets and average monthly earnings); instead, they are set by people's *perception* of the value of a share in that company. This is why the stock price of a company like Tesla Motors can go from $50 dollars per share to $200 per share in less than a month. Tesla did not magically quadruple their net worth in 2 weeks time, instead what happened was that people *felt* like Tesla was a good company to invest in, which caused a demand for the stock. This demand caused the stock price to increase, speciously confirming the whims of investors, which increased the demand/stock-price even further. Rinse, wash, repeat. Finally some of the investors thought to themselves, "wait, what if Tesla *isn't* worth this much?" and decide to sell, increasing the supply and stabilizing or devaluing the stock price. But the whole thing is a circlejerk, because the primary thing dictating the value of the stock, are people's perceptions of the value of the stock. This is why there are so [many theories about how to set a real value to the price of stock]( it's why all these theories are unreliable; it's why there's an entire field dedicated to studying [behavioral economics]( it's why [WP gives this]( as primary definition of the value of stock: "the stock price is the highest amount someone is willing to pay for the stock, or the lowest amount that it can be bought for"; it's why some of the most lauded economists in history have stock valuation theories called things like the [Keynesian beauty contest]( or the [Greater Fool Theory]( or [Contrarian Investing]( or [Random Walk Hypothesis]( It's why the most talented staticticians and data analysts are employed by financial institutions in attempts to explain/predict stock price fluctuation, and it's why even these fellas haven't developed game-changing models; and it's why many of them believe that stock price is best explained as a [Martingale]( which in essentially means that the stockmarket can accurately be described as a fair game where knowledge of past events never helps predict the mean of the future winnings... so yeah, the value of stock is arbitrary in that sense. Kinda scary right?

This actually sounds like a good thing relatively speaking, since common stock prices are arbitrarily set by consumer supply and demand, not tangible assets.
