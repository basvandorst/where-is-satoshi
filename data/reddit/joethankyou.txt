It's a pretty big step up if you ask me.  I'm protected against complete physical theft or destruction of everything i own, my family can recover my wallet, but only after i die or become mentally impaired.  Also, i can access my funds conveniently without ever exposing my private key to any possibly compromised device.
BTW, the backup isn't a paper wallet, it's 24 words, which isn't sufficient to access my wallets.

if it fails, buy a new one and restore your wallet with your 24 words, it uses the BIP-39 standard for creating deterministic HD wallets, so it doesn't have to be the same model, or even manufacturer.

BUY A HARDWARE WALLET
For any reasonably large amount of value, ~1 BTC, I would STRONGLY suggest you get a hardware wallet.  I personally prefer the Trezor, but Ledger Nano S and KeepKey are very popular as well.  The extra layers of security including a PIN number and an optional passphrase are WELL worth the price of ~$80-100.  Paper wallets are trouble waiting to happen IMO, they're a single point of failure.

This is the top comment!
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:35:48
no, because i have an additional paraphrase on top of my 24 words that is necessary to accesss my wallets.  typically, paper wallets include public and private keys.
EDIT: as well, you can create a decoy wallet simply using a different passphrase with a small portion of funds to secure against a $5 wrench attack.
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:53:58
backup your 24 words, or memorize them, or preferably both.  If you backup your 24 words on paper, place it in a safe, and DEFINITELY use a passphrase for additional security in case one of the copies gets compromised.

PIN number protects against theft, 24 words and a passphrase memorized protects against fire.
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:44:42
well, it's not a real wallet without the passphrase...

Aren't those codes only so you can log into your Google account if you lose your phone? I don't think you can use them in place of your authenticator's generated key for a service like bittrex which is based on that secret QR code from bittrex at setup.  Am I wrong?

This is a couple of months old, but all of the points are still very relevant.  Now that this correction seems to be over, we've flushed out the weak hands and can reset with these strong fundamentals.

Are you saying that peer to peer systems aren't disruptive, or that governments have successfully controlled them?
@_date: 2013-05-08 20:35:00
That's just flat out wrong, they're not actually throwing people in jail for using torrents, it's impractical to attack the users, it's decentralized, and it's also used for legal sharing.  They're only attacking sites like thepiratebay.  There are no substantial anti-peer-to-peer laws that truly affect the users.
Sure, bitcoin has less traction, but they still have a total value of over one billion dollars, a lot of which is used for legitimate business.  If the govt. starts throwing people in jail for doing legitimate business and not hurting anybody, there will be a shit show.  The govt should be able to handle illegal file-sharing *more easily* because people are actually *stealing* from other people.  There's even less political traction to completely destroy an entire market without that moral ammunition of protecting property rights.

If they start throwing people in jail for using bitcoin, I think they'll have a hard time staying in power (democracy).  If they don't start throwing people in jail for using bitcoin, I think they're going to have a hard time keeping their power (through currency manipulation).
