Right but if you buy many coins of something that is $0.01 and it ends up $10 a couple of years from now, that is a significantly larger reward than small fraction of a larger coin. 
I’m just saying, throwing small amount as lotto into some of these cheaper coins and seeing market cap vs their price/rank would be useful. But, that may not be the motivation for your app and I can understand you not implementing such a feature. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 04:27:46
For me specifically, let’s say I wanted to throw $50 into a few random cheap coins as a lotto ticket. I’d sort by price (low to high) and pick off a few high ranking coins then research and decide which to throw some expendable money at. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 04:02:08
Nice app. Sorting feature would be great too so you can compare ranking to current price. Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 05:06:28
Get a life. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 04:52:55
Agreed. And I’m a seasoned investor in stocks, options and commodities. I also already own XRP, LTC and XMR. I just wanted to throw $50 into a few random coins for fun and let it sit. It’s not investing, just fun to see if any of them ever take off. 
I’ll go find a site that allows this sorting to suit my needs. I can see your app probably isn’t the model for that type of view. You can / should stick to the current model of just rank-based view which is great. I find your app very useful and one stop shop to see current prices of the currencies I’m following. 
Thanks again.

Good write up. Needs a bit better formatting though. 
As for the printing avoiding inflation, I’m not entirely sure what you mean by that. If I print my crypto and store it, if it happens to be worth less in the future than now how did printing it avoid that? Also, printing it won’t protect it from regulation either. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 04:18:38
There would be a header for the 3 columns. Rank, Currency, Price. If I click price, sort ascending but keep updating prices in real time with their actual rank still in place. Clicking again would sort descending etc..
I know it’s largely a rank-based app but sorting by price would be huge too. Thanks.

Decentralized and free? Then why are the fees so high? Miners holding BTC hostage. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:07:19
That’s what I meant. It’s not really free as in freedom if BTC is being held hostage by miners with ridiculous fees.

And “they” are always accurate about price predictions. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:08:42
If you’re refreshing the charts every 10 mins then your position size in BTC is too large for your financial situation so no, you’re not alright. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 08:21:44
Did you look at the list? The top 10 are reputable. By that I mean they have a chance of long term success. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:11:19
There is no backup method. You need to store your scratch codes somewhere safe. They are 1 time use but you get a few to use just in case. Then if this issue arises, you use the scratch code, get back into your service and disable / reenable 2FA and get it setup on your new device. This also will give you new scratch codes. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 00:53:59
What’s right exactly? Sending to GDAX from Coinbase then buying there?
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:18:59
Got your mind on your money and your money on your mind. Understandable. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 00:17:13
Not to sound rude and in all seriousness, what if you’re traveling together and the unfortunate happens? Maybe a 3rd party is necessary here?
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:42:38
I own several cryptos and math/comp sci grad so trust me, I love crypto and see the future. My comment wasn’t against crypto but the fact remains it’s not backed by anything. 
As bad as fiat is, some regulations help protect people whereas in crypto it’s the wild Wild West (right now) and that may change later. 
Again, my point was and is a fact, crypto is not backed by anything. But then again, neither is anything else. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 07:18:33
So basically, you guessed and were right? How many times were you wrong but failed to make a post proclaiming how wrong you were?
@_date: 2017-09-10 15:20:27
Up to you. I’m just a stranger on Reddit. 60%, 70%, 75% it’s all up to you. I just suggest to diversify a bit. There are cheaper coins out there with a lot of promising futures that could rise significantly so a 5% Stake in them could be worth a lot. While your BTC investment is your “safe” bet. What safe means in crypto :)
@_date: 2017-09-02 23:47:10
I heard going from GDAX to other exchanges is free whereas Coinbase to other exchanges costs. However, lately I’ve been using BTC for conversion but I think I’ve been going at it wrong as some suggested it’s better to go with ETH if I’m looking just to convert.
My apologies for breaking the rules. I figured folks here do convert BTC often and needs advice. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 01:47:04
Transfer to a wallet you control the keys to. Then once you confirm the transaction, delete the wallet and keep sending money to the public address overtime if you want to keep investing. 
There is no need to have the wallet installed if you don’t plan to send money back out and intend to hold long term. 
Edit: of course, store your keys / passphrase somewhere safe. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:32:19
There are already quantum algorithms for crypto that would then be leveraged. Shors Algorithm and others. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 00:57:44
GDAX has enhanced verification for which I like to avoid. I pay the higher fees for now. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:43:37
Wow. Spoken like one of the worst investors ever. Good luck “holding”.  
@_date: 2017-09-13 03:33:47
If you’re scared then you have too much allocated to BTC/crypto in general. Also, you should be scared...BTC is not the future. There is tech far superior but BTC serves its purpose to bring block chain to the masses. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 04:09:56
True that. I missed the boat (but I’m well off). I’m glad to see the new generation of wealth. Hopefully it’s not like lotto winners that blow it but rather grow it and sustain many of their generations. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:42:05
That valuation is only a result of what users who accept it are willing to value it at. With the amount of not only competition but actually better tech with lower fees, I just don’t see it. But arguing about valuations is difficult argument because both of our thoughts are just opinions :)
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:58:21
No crypto is backed by anything. Even the “good” ones. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 16:40:17
It’s safe to ignore all zerohedge articles. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 19:00:23
Why do you need that level of verification to buy BTC and covert to LTC? I’ve done this multiple times and my verification was only mobile phone and email. I also have 2FA enabled. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 03:09:48
I get irritated when people use “no” when they mean “know”. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:48:48
Sometimes it does. There are psychological points where sellers step in and drive it further down OR stop orders trigger and cause more sell orders. Never seen a crash before?
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:25:45
Realization. Realization that BTC grew too large for no reason whatsoever. Now it’s coming down to earth where it will never see $5k again. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 12:46:43
Who cares about the mining equipment if they can pull out billions right away. One huge heist...

He’s not saying the mathematical foundation of BTC/crypto is a fraud. He’s calling the system, the need for it and its future a fraud. 
I’m not heavily invested but I plan to be over the next few years slowly year over year so all this panic selling is good news for us buyers. 
Note: I never plan to buy and hold BTC. I only buy it to convert to other coins. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:15:28
You’re right. I’m a cryptanalyst and developer so yes, I’m clueless. Just making up numbers and having hope isn’t taking BTC to $100k. No where near it. 
BTC served its purpose well which was to break ground on the industry. Now it will die just like any other pioneer as it gives way to better tech. 
People will soon, psychologically, stop depending on BTC then it will truly tank and drop in market cap. As soon as 5 years from now (see, anyone can make up numbers). 
@_date: 2017-09-09 04:46:11
BTC will not break $5k for a long time.

Ok if that’s the case, that’s weird I guess. Although I go long and short on equities all the time like in stock options selling strangles in MSFT and others. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 02:44:42
Its called pairs trading. I’m assuming OP is talking long one coin and short another. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 03:37:09
What do you think the wallet has anything to do with your fees?
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:34:56
If you really believe in crypto, you’re praying for it to go down to $2000 or even less and bring everything else down with it. It would be a gift for long term holders to load up.

Uhh there’s pretty much every coin that does that. XMR even enhances it as so many others. BTC can’t be the one trick pony forever. Branding is the only thing keeping BTC at this valuation. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:59:43
You’re delirious if you think BTC will ever be $100k. There is too much competing, better tech now.

That’s what I see about this community...everyone just talks about price. Exuberant when price is going up and panic like last night when their precious BTC isn’t going up $100/day like they’re used to. 
The fact that so many posts revolve around price vs encouraging adoption, that’s why I think BTC is doomed to linger in 4-5k range for awhile but the tech is also weak compared to others. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:29:26
The link below may help. But what I do is when setting up my 2FA, I take a picture of the QR code or print it and keep it somewhere safe. Then if I mess up my phone or lose it then I just scan the code using the new device. It still then generates the same codes as that is the seed. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 15:11:42
You’re asking a biased community here. I’d put 60% of it in BTC if you feel that strongly about BTC then diversify the other 40% into 2-3 other coins that you like. No need to put all your eggs in one basket. And along the way, you’ll learn about the way others are implementing emerging tech. BTC is not the end all and be all of crypto, there is room for other coins to be successful. Be a part of that as well. 
IMHO. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:36:28
This doesn’t even make sense. Holding BTC comes with greater risk thus the greater reward. You can’t compare the returns between crypto and equities without mentioning risk. Your post is biased and thus useless. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 02:31:28
Optimus finally investing in crypto?
@_date: 2017-09-13 03:16:58
I’m a selloff, everything becomes correlated very quickly. There is no diversifying in cryptos. True diversification is having crypto, stocks, bonds, precious metals, other commodities etc...
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:30:20
XMR, LTC, IOT. ARK is good too but fees are still high. Same goes for XMR but there is no privacy coin that rivals it. I hope no one mentions XVG in response to me mentioning XMR, that thing is vaporware. 
I’m not vested in all of the above, just 2 of the 4. I’m still going through the code and learning how things really work before putting money in. 
There are others that may make a nice profit for early investors but I’m talking about non-niche rivals to BTC. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 22:07:23
Well, when you need sound financial advice — it makes sense to go to the strangers on the internet to ask and on top ask it in crypto subs. Dude. Come on. Thank goodness you got a good first reply.

@_date: 2017-09-06 00:51:19
Yup. Agreed. I think most provide 2 options though right? 1. Sign-in or 2. Deposit 2 small amounts (this is how I did it through Coinbase). 
@_date: 2017-09-02 03:19:01
What constitutes a weak address exactly? Doesn’t the wallet generator tools or built into the app generate them securely? Assuming you’re offline generating them. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 01:00:24
You can track transactions per address and eventually sort it all out to know what and how much went where. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 19:30:33
For me to fund GDAX with USD it requires higher verification. I can buy on Coinbase with basic verification. I was hoping to then transfer USD or BTC, whichever is less fees, then buy/Transfer BTC (or ETH) elsewhere to convert to altcoins. However, I think as others have also commented, it’s better to just go with ETH for less fees assuming the altcoin supports it. In this case, IOTA does. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:17:45
They will collect transaction fees. But what happens when fees get too low?
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:17:04

@_date: 2017-09-12 22:06:09
Yea you’re right.  I just posted it for assistance with codes but you’re right it doesn’t help for external services. For that, it’s best to save the QR code screenshot so you can set it up elsewhere. 
Maybe Bittrex and other services offer scratch codes as well?
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:44:28
That’s how most transfer work that are tied to a bank account. I don’t like it but they deposit small amount to verify you own the account as a way to establish trust. This is why I only link checking accounts that I only put a small amount in with the intention that it will be transferred elsewhere while I keep my day to day checking and savings accounts inaccessible. 
Edit: Coinbase is what I was referring to in my comment.

I never said it was secret. But every shop has their way of work, processes, code repos and how they manage etc..just sounds like BS but you’re trying really hard from all your comments to prove otherwise so it probably is BS but I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Not that you should care. 
As far as the industry. I’m well aware. I write code for a living and I do cryptanalysis as a hobby. Math and Comp Sci Masters..now I’m trying too hard...
