 i know the kid and he told me it was about 3hrs of work. the kind of work he could do with his eyes closed. this was when bitcoin was worth next to nothing. you guys seem so butthurt, maybe you shouldn’t be investing to begin with, i tell a quick story and i get downvoted into oblivion. No wonder i see this sub on r/cringe so frequently.

did he get up and scream alot?
@_date: 2014-03-09 20:44:45
guys can we stop it already? We got robbed. No your not going to get your coins back. The guy robbed you. Even if he came out and said "yeah i did it" you still wouldnt get your coins back.

i took mushrooms as a young man, snapped me right out of a 5 year depression. not speaking for all but it made me a better person. Better than pumping people full of antidepressants just to feel numb.

the kid had a million in his hand, for free... pigs get slaughtered.

People don't want to hear that but yeah. If bitcoin ever becomes a threat to the dollar bitcoin will be destroyed overnight. To think anything else would be naive.

@_date: 2014-08-28 14:16:41
im sorry it upsets you, everything you wrote is fine and great but i cant deny how they helped me. 
@_date: 2014-08-18 13:32:47
knew a kid that had 1000 BTC he got for free for helping design a website and begged him to sell at 1100. it sickens me and it wasnt even my money. 
@_date: 2014-08-28 14:59:07
I am. Just because a couple of people talk crazy doesn't mean you should demonize the theory as a whole. With all due respect your looking at this too myopically picking buzzwords out of a sentence. Are you against medical marijuana too?
@_date: 2014-08-18 22:12:39
because im not at all involved with bitcoin. retrospect wasn’t needed. $1100000 in the hand...for 3 hours of his time...you defend it because you probably made the same terrible life-altering mistake...you people (not all) are fucking retarded and shouldn’t be doing anything investment wise. i don’t want to see anyone lose money but to defend the decision to hold at 1100 a coin? damn.

Psychedelics should be studied further in my opinion in the same of science. It shouldn't be off-limits because they are illegal. These are drugs that alter consciousness profoundly, not herbal elixirs picked from a sacred mountain blessed by a shaman.

some of you people have went completely batshit. I dont hold any BTC just telling you about a buddy of mine. keep in mind i told a quick story about a kid i know and im being downvoted for it. 
@_date: 2014-06-06 13:19:03
he always does. 
@_date: 2014-08-18 13:57:28
no, for what he said was about 3 hours of "work". You people are way too emotional to hold a rational conversation right now. 
@_date: 2013-10-05 17:40:17
i for one would much rather walk into a store give cash walk out with bitcoin and not have to set up an account and all that, the idea is that its as easy as buying milk.

Thats complete garbage. The neo nazi stuff was a smear campaign when he was getting close to the Whitehouse.  
would a neo nazi pay for the hospital bills of a black person he didn’t know? He did, would you?
@_date: 2013-10-05 17:18:12
The guarantee i would go out of business if i did such a thing. This would be a physical store.

Man oh man the pigs are getting slaughtered. But we all knew this needed to happen.

A up to date Ubuntu fresh install. Downloaded electrum and VLC from the official sites. On a WPA2 protected router. I guess some guys out there are just really good at hacking. Not totally devastated over it because i purchased at 160. It was alot of fun watching it rise the way it did but in the end crushed my trust in it.

I fail to see the humor in it. though this idea isn’t feasible you don’t need to get all shitty. just asking knowledgeable people if selling bitcoin in a physical store could work. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:30:37
I hope your right 110%

localcoins has a very sketchy feel
Coinbase not so anonymous 
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:55:11
it would take weeks. thats up to you. Use google.

interesting business but not in love with having to be booked and have to abide by a set schedule.. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 15:10:57
Yeah, I had .8 Bitcoin hacked from me and have no idea how it happened. I didn’t get scammed, I had them in my wallet one day and it was gone the next. Not running windows, never downloaded and installed anything but my wallet and vlc. When Bitcoin becomes more secure ill jump back in but it made me lose total confidence in it.
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:33:40
Odd comment. Didn't say anything about "jewish" and im not sure how Rothschild makes me a cook.  If people listened they would have saved themselves from this crash. But fuck me right?
