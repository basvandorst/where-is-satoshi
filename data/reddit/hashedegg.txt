Uhm hygiene and food quality, to name a few, are not subjective. Lots of alt coins out perform bcash on fees, speed and decentralization. All of which are not subjective variables. You are free to base your decision on subjectivity of course. Doesn't seem too wise to me though...

Never claimed I did, reading into things are you?
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:53:00
Well? Was she wrong?

Sure, but not many people get the same for us as Capone did. Still, would not try it myself, but Capone as an example is a bit irrelevant

If you think the price movement of the last couple of months are due to adoption and technical innovation you are definitely the one with illusions...

After xt and the attempted bch take over I think it's safe to say there is consensus. Only the consensus is towards small blocks, which some folks don't want to accept. While I agree the reaction of/on this sub against the whole big block debate is quite aggressive, I think it is quite understandable though. One of the fundamentals of bitcoin is it being the "one and only". Now after the debate has been repeated a bunch of times and the community has chosen multiple times to go for the smaller blocks it doesn't look like the big blockers are trying to have an honest debate from this perspective. It feels like an attack on bitcoins integrity to them.

Which is kind of my point. The AC/DC debate at the time wasn't won because of competing tech or anything, they serve vastly different purposes. Using DC on a mainnet is outright suicidal and using AC for a battery is practically impossible.

Oeee I'm afraid you got the wrong one, that's a hard fork you bought right there. Soft forks is what's jiving the kids these days!

Do you see Trump being kind on, well, anything?

If I understand the article correctly, the Dutch invented option trading? And figured out the risks of no regulation in the process I guess.
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:56:45
Also; cults
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:52:04
Yeah, but not a single country uses DC on their mainnet. That's just asking for explosions
@_date: 2017-08-20 01:29:57
Interviewers also acted like dicks tbh

People who just ate their own dick?

Indeed, just look at how popular the wolf of wall street memes are...

Right, his point being that no one uses or really mentions Myspace, let alone it's predecessors. Facebook destroyed Myspace because it was easier and offered more features for the average user.

Lol, you tell yourself that

Check out Maastricht too, very beautiful city.

Oh fuck, did I miss the Reddit hard fork?

Im more of a telegram kind of guy

Well, with a part of the miners leaving, spamming the network and increase in genuine traffic due to the fork(s) the fees are high again. It also doesnt help the devs are kept busy preparing for a non-replay protected fork that's cancelled at the last moment. Despite all of this bitcoin still retains value, which is more important at the moment. A store of value. Transactions are fun and all, but it means shit if the coin you are transferring is worth shit tomorrow. Buying BCH for the sake of lower transaction fees only make sense if you use it as an intermediary, which other alts do cheaper and faster. 
The fees will drop down once the difficulty is adjusted and the spammers run out of bitcoin. That's at least my interpretation of this whole situation.

Yeah everyone has heard it's better to hodl your bitcoin. And everyone thinks they are smarter than the rest or wants to be creative/original. But that doesn't work in markets where prices go up when everyone actually agrees with each other...
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:24:42
He claims to be a day trader. Yes you can buy nice round numbers if it's a one time purchase, but not if you day trade... That just doesn't make sense

Jeej! my username is relevant!
@_date: 2017-09-02 20:59:19


as opposed to reasonably OCD?
@_date: 2017-09-03 13:38:19
It's only a disorder when it causes problems for the person or those around him/her. Which pretty much covers the unreasonable part
@_date: 2017-10-27 10:38:26
So much this... This whole segwit2x thing put me off BTC as a (relative) new user

Damn, getting rich while showering! I think you are on to something

Wtf dude, don't go spreading smut like this! I don't think that adapter is even of legal age!
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:57:39
Oh right, yeah that makes sense.
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:03:28
What reasons would that be?
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:27:54
So the rush to withdraw in time, before the update that's supposed to speed up transactions, is delayed because the system is too slow? Heh
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:01:16
So what would be their motivation to delay and lie about it? Seems dumb to me for an exchange to risk their reputation like that...
