Yes that would be terrible.... how are you sure this isn't already in practice? Better tell the FBI to get on it right away.
You know what else would be terrible? This scenario, or this one. Or that other scenario that doesn't exist, but I could make up and then apply it to the current one being discussed.
The fact is, DRP and SR fight for liberterian ideals and the rights of humans to consume whatever prodcuts they want. My theory remains that if one is smart enough to opperate TOR successfully and obtain and use bitcoins, they likley aren't stupid enough to 1) commit crimes in order to obtain their drugs and 2) are not so afflicted by addiction that they make irrational decisions since they have not pawned their computer, yet.
The facts of the matter remain, the War on Drugs has crippled generations from an effective workforce within the US via prison and post-encarceration infomral sanctions like non-hiring of felons by many companies. 
Additionally drug use remains constant despite efforts to reduce consumption. 
Clearly a new take on the issue of drug consuption should be at least considered. Our current practice not only hinders those who use drugs, it burdons the taxpayers to support those drug addcits in prison, rahter than helping them deal with their additctions and offering gainful employment options. I for one do not like paying taxes for a pot-head, or heroin addict to sit in a concrete box and get fed and taken care of for years, only to come out of prison and find himself unable to find employment and end up commiting "so called crimes" to end right back in the concrete box for me to pay some more.

Hasn't that been the argument for the majority of the time?

Lol, well I am all for sensible rules, but rules regarding human behavior. Not rules prohibiting liberties. Scheduling drugs puts responsibility on the inanimate object and takes away it away from the person.
"Ban the alcohol, it turns my husband into a blithering idiot who chases other women besides me. It makes him sloppy and abusive. Its the alcohol's fault! Ban the alcohol!"
Sure, Bill probably got much better and treated his wife better after they banned alcohol. So, since it worked for Bill, it should work for everyone. Now everyone cannot drink alcohol. 
Arise the problems of prohibition. Unregulated alcohol production which causes adverse health effects since its brewed in iron rusitng tubs that no health inspector has checked out. Gangs distributing the substance. People being incarcerated for it. Ect. Ect. Ect.
This same principle applies to all substances. Coming from someone who has tried about every drug under the sun, alchohol is no different than heroin in this regard! I cannot stress this enough, and I emplore you not to jump to conclusions about the addictive nature of a substance that you do not have first hand experience with! To do so is truely ignorance in its greatest form! Along the lines of prohibing gay marriage just because you have heard about the bad morals and diseases gays spread... or whatever other foolish reason you have against gay marriage.
Perhaps this is just an argument of ideals and we stand at opposing ends of the spectrum, but if you look at all data from countries where all substances have been legalized to a degree and they are regulated, then the numbers of actual use of hard drugs drops. It does not rise. Portugal is an example. The Netherlands is an example. 
I argue that all humans are essentially the same and that if all drugs were at least decriminalized and regulated, then you would not see a dramatic jump in use **based off the numbers of other countries who already practice this** the **science** shows that people who will use will do so despite the legality of the substance. As is echoed in alcohol prohibition....

Right. Well, as it is heroin killed about 4 of my friends from high school and Im lucky I escaped its clutches, I still stand by my stance that it all should be legal. My friends and myself all knew what we were putting into and doing to our bodies. Perhaps if we had a more reliable source than some illicit mexican drug dealer and more reasonable treatment policies for those seeking help they would still be alive, instead of just suffering in their addiction with varying heroin quality ultimately leading to the shot that killed them and the fear of seeking help because of legal repurcussions. 
Just a thought from a former heroin addict and advocate of sensible drug policy and the responsibility of humans for their own actions and the neglect of parents not to intervene in their child's life. 
Besides, it was so much easier for me to buy Pot at my high school than it was for me to obtain alcohol and alcohl is legal and regulated! Cigarettes were easily obtainable until the store that sold them to minors got busted and the arabian guy there went to jail. 
Implications and food for thought.

If you say so. In my experience something being illegal has not stopped myself or aquantences from using it. 
Kinda like prohibition of alcohol didn't stop people from drinking.

People can also drink alcohol practically every day with serious health consequences.... 
Its a matter of moderation and education. Just flat out restricting it from people, does not stop them from doing it.
