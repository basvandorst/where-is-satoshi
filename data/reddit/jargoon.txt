I can confirm the “you would have sold already”, because that’s exactly what I did. Bought in at $1, sold at $40, made a nice little profit. No regrets though, nobody could have predicted the insanity of the last year back then.

If you couldn’t buy fractions, almost nobody would be investing in it at this price.

The gateways convert the money into stellar coins and then the network matches up a buyer and seller just like the stock market. Your gateway keeps the USD (for example), it transfers the stellars to the seller's gateway, and the seller's gateway sends you the other currency. 
It works just like a Bitcoin exchange except there is an intermediary currency used as a unit of transfer. 
@_date: 2014-07-31 17:22:28
But what we DO need is a fast, decentralized exchange for converting between currencies (which this appears to be).

Ouch that is rough, I pay my landlord that way sometimes.

From what I saw in the Congressional hearing, Congress already supports Bitcoin, as does the Secret Service. They were surprisingly receptive.

My old employer Naughty America announced a few days ago that they were going to accept bitcoin. Just tell your boss that if Naughty America can do it so can you guys :)
Edit: Also the number one biggest thing you should be pitching to him is NO CHARGEBACKS

If I'm not mistaken, this gets around that by offloading dealing with the legacy interfaces to the gateways. 
@_date: 2016-03-12 06:53:32
Okay, what's the difference between that and walking around with a pocketful of cash? The government can't hack into that either.

They're pretty good now (I switched about 6 months ago), but honestly there isn't much reason to switch unless you need specific features. For me it was the Google Voice integration, but if iOS got that I would probably switch back.

I suspect it might have to do with their rules about encryption in apps marked for international distribution.

That's a big reason why I'm convincing my dating site client [SetForMarriage.com]( to start accepting bitcoin as a payment method. It is also perfect for other high-risk industries such as porn sites, vitamin supplements, and e-cigarettes (all of which I have had as clients in the past).
While the upside is the vendors are no longer subject to fraud and chargeback risk, the downside is that the consumers now assume the risk. Chargebacks are a pain in the ass for merchants, but they are an important tool for protecting the customers. I'm guessing we'll need some kind of trust system in place as well.
@_date: 2013-12-10 11:06:36
Yeah sorry dawg, copy paste has been in iOS since 2009.

Like I said, no offense to Diaspora, but the purpose of this project is to get it in front of Facebook's 1 billion+ users and their social networks.
Also, I'd guess most Diaspora users probably already know about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-31 01:35:45
Hey the more ways to use Bitcoin the better :)
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:06:45
Maybe we'll finally get those Battlemechs :)
@_date: 2013-12-10 11:00:12
Congratulations you are so awesome
@_date: 2013-12-06 08:12:04
Yeah in the 1950s maybe
@_date: 2013-12-26 09:22:41
I have spent many days on this sub and I fully think Bitcoin has a big place in the world economy but I am not a libertarian
@_date: 2013-03-31 01:17:17
No offense to diaspora, but if the objective is mass adoption that's not the best place to start.
Also, Facebook has not put up any resistance, let's not get ahead of ourselves.

Step 4: some other hypothetical situation
@_date: 2013-12-29 08:00:31
I think it's surprising that Charles Stross is so against bitcoin, since cryptocurrency is the kind of thing that is basically perfect for the "Economy 2.0" scenario in his excellent futurist book [Accelerando]( (available for free download on his site).
Of course, the Economy 2.0 in the book uses massive numbers of shell companies controlled by AIs, but I could easily see the same thing happening with massive numbers of computer-created altcoins and trading markets.
@_date: 2013-03-19 22:41:11
I'm working on convincing the owner of  (one of my clients) to start accepting Bitcoin. It's perfect because dating sites have a big problem with chargebacks and fraud, and Bitcoin basically eliminates that.
I'll post again if I am successful :)
@_date: 2013-02-24 19:09:57
Condolences, but I think it's important to remember that Bitcoin websites are not banks, and there's no FDIC for Bitcoin. Keep your Bitcoin in a local wallet and back it up automatically (like by putting it on Dropbox or Google Drive).
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:51:42
Android does the exact same thing. It's about protecting non-technical people from themselves while allowing the tech-savvy to do whatever they want.
@_date: 2013-04-15 09:52:02
This is a non-sequitur. Buildings and a free market are not the same thing. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 02:47:40
Wait, you have to be a libertarian to like bitcoin? :(
@_date: 2013-12-10 11:23:54
Yet :)
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:39:56
Good idea though, not every good idea works out is all :)

I'm long past my Linux/foobar super customization days and just want my everyday shit to work so I can focus on writing code and making money. That's why I love my Mac.

They can't do anything about a chrome extension :)
@_date: 2013-12-10 10:54:04
iOS does the same thing,it's just after you've installed the app. Apps have to ask for permission to access location, contacts, etc. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 10:56:49
It's very unstable and not usable for daily use.

Since when has time, effort, and equipment stopped a determined attacker?

All you have to do is right click on it and hit open instead of double clicking. It's not exactly locking the thing down with an iron grip.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:01:34
I honestly think they just want to see what is going to happen. I think they're open to the possibility that some kind of cryptocurrency could serve as a "universal baseline currency" or medium of exchange between countries.
If Bitcoin ends up "working", I can see them possibly setting up their own version where they attempt to control 51% of the processing power in order to guarantee no forking of the blockchain.

It's come a long way since the only thing I could find to do with bitcoins was bet on Starcraft II GSL matches :)

According to statements from their CEO, it looks like they're under a the same gag order as other tech companies (which means they've been served with requests).

It's a similar idea to dollar-cost averaging

You forget this is the guy who publicly spoke out against DRM and ebook price fixing? 
Many of the "stolen" ideas were Apple acquiring the companies that made them, and in a lot of the other cases Apple tried to acquire them and were turned down.

It seems like the best hedge against society collapsing is putting all your money into guns and canned food.

I don't think it's productive to act on imaginary things that have not actually happened yet. Facebook may very well not care.

Haha you can install whatever the fuck you want on Macs. I don't know where you're getting your info from, but it clearly isn't from experience.
