Possibly a miner from early on. Someone with more bitcoins than sense.

I didn't know that. How is it bad though? In regards to functionality.
@_date: 2014-09-22 05:48:50
Also, I wouldn't go as far as to say it's vastly inferior, but at the moment, you could argue that it is inferior, depending on what you're talking about, just because bitcoin is still in a very early stage, in the grand scheme of things.

Not exactly. She clearly had an agenda to prove to the viewers that cryptocurrencies are "bad", like how she repeated a couple of times how bitcoin has no backing yet fiat does, and how she says she finds it hard to believe how it could ever be considered an alternative to fiat. Most of her rebuttals were centered around that same agenda.

I'm not from the US but she seemed to have that condescending tone /speech that I only ever hear from the journo puppets you see on Fox news and such. Majority of journos I've seen have been much less "in your face" and considering Ron Paul is such a humble speaker it her tone comes across as unneccesary. But I agree about who she's speaking.

Just a guess but I believe in the coming years we will either see huge improvements in bitcoin, or other projects that improve on bitcoin. I doubt bitcoin will be the future of money, most likely a better alternative.

You didn't tell me there would be bees! That's awesome will save this for when I can afford it.

That's pretty much what I was getting at. He's using it's current immaturity against a matured system to say it's incapable which is ridiculous.
@_date: 2014-09-18 23:21:00
Mmm I love it.
@_date: 2014-01-16 11:02:59
I was going to say ignorance but, I swear they know exactly what's up, and what's "right" but they just loving pushing the agenda of the far right, they love to keep the arguements/drama going because that's what sells, right? But then again sometimes I hear them say the most hair brained things and I think, "No, that is so mental that it can't possibly be made up".
@_date: 2014-09-04 02:13:57
Of course it has

I wish I had known this. Never ever thought it could take more than about half an hour.

They finally got back to me. Apparently my account was placed in review because they have had a spike in bank fraud. Would have been nice if they had messaged me as soon as I made the payment asking me for further proof instead of having me wait 2 days for them to answer a support ticket.
@_date: 2015-01-24 21:36:42
This is becoming a joke. So I sent them the receipt number thinking that would do and they get back to me 15 hours later saying they need the full receipt and that they also need to speak with me. So now I'm looking at the calendar to schedule an interview or whatever the fuck it is and the earliest is in 3 days... If they don't except the full receipt I'm going to declare those fuckers certified scammers

I support bitcoin but this looks like propaganda.
@_date: 2015-07-20 14:47:57
After hearing it's locked in for another season I assumed they're gonna need a bit of material lined up to stop from going stale. There's absolutely no way crypto currency won't be used, I'm calling it now.

It's a drama, not a documentary.

Alexis seems like a pretty well rounded, stand up guy. I have to give props to the presenter though, he obviously knew what he was talking about.
@_date: 2013-08-15 08:20:13
Yes but even if it did happen it would not be the end of silkroad and that was your original question. Like kidioki said you're pushing hypotheticals as if they are a real threat worth discussion. Also I don't see the irony between my username and comment could you please enlighten me?

I know who to call next time I get into a fight with a cat.

I haven't been using the site very long but I've been thoroughly impressed by it. Didn't have a problem.

Must be the capitalist label.
@_date: 2013-09-06 11:29:42
I've seen this around lately (the 1 internet tip that is) and I found out what it means but is there a history behind it? How did it start exactly? I'm guessing there is a thread somewhere but I can't seem to find it.
@_date: 2013-09-25 08:08:38
You only think that because you correlate it with the dark net. Remember not many people know about the dark net and bitcoin has come a lot farther than relying on simply the darknet. What are your thoughts on the name litecoin?

@_date: 2013-09-25 09:31:56
After originally writing that comment I immediately thought well what if that was their intention to name it after the dark net. It seems I've pretty much wasted my time arguing against myself. Thanks anyway :)

As an Australian I'm so happy these guys are around, they blow all other companies out of the water. I just can't wait for the Android app.

If you think any differently you run the risk of being labelled a conspiratard too.
@_date: 2013-09-06 11:34:50
Na you don't get out that easy. That wasn't sarcasm and you know it. 
@_date: 2013-08-15 10:24:39
How you can possibly think that something so speculative is worth discussion is beyond me. If my brain is foggy yours must be malfunctioning something hard.
