They're not going to pass up the opportunity to call it Facebuck

Anyone who knows what a cost basis is would never have asked you the question in the first place.

Except alts aren't all trying to be money. Crypto is going to be much bigger than just bitcoin...you should accept that. It's a good thing and the world will change for the better.

What if I told you even a 1000x is possible from here. $10M endgame.
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:13:15
100 day moving average, wherever that is (8k?). Btc historically always bounces off that repeatedly in a bull market.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:01:36
That's not a rule at all let alone the  rule. In fact many investors only invest when a stock makes a new all time high. Not saying it was the right move here, but i don't see why you would talk down to people when you're wrong yourself.

Technically it's still a fork, but not a hard fork as it has its own genesis block.
@_date: 2018-08-04 10:27:12
Well if people are that stupid and there's only like 8 satoshis left then they'll be worth a lot. For daily transactions we'd have to move to litecoin or something.

The value of bitcoin would skyrocket before they were able to buy huge amounts of it. At the same time the value of the fiat they're printing would become less and less.

Steem was just ranked  crypto and Bitshares  by China's ministry of industry and information. They are considered some of the best and EOS is the most anticipated main net launch of the year.
@_date: 2018-05-12 14:24:36
Bitcoin is by far the biggest and most famous cryptocurrency in the world. Why the fuck is this sub so obsessed with bcash. Who cares at this point, bcash is never ever going to overtake bitcoin so let them live in their deluded shitcoin world and stop giving them so much attention.

And the lines and squiggles are constantly shifted. All the analysis happens after the fact.

And boomers parents handed them the most prosperous time in history on a silver platter. While boomers handed us a shit sandwich. Slightly different...boomers idealism was just youthful angst and naivete.
@_date: 2019-11-07 02:37:04
One thing millennials will not do is fall in line. They are what 22-38 years old now, I expect massive upheaval in many institutions in the coming years. Home ownership, car ownership, money, work, entertainment, etc are all going to be flipped on its head. Boomers screwed them, they are not going to play by their rigged rules.
@_date: 2019-11-07 12:53:30
Sharing economy is being born out of necessity. Previous generation was all about ownership. Millennials are about sharing and collaborating.
@_date: 2019-11-07 03:16:38
It's already happening though. Concept of work, home, travel, money will be unrecognizable in 20 years.
@_date: 2019-11-08 17:17:48
Yes your one example disproves my point.  Terrible argument.
@_date: 2019-08-15 19:12:29
Why worried? If it dips to say 8500 add more. This is early bull market.
@_date: 2018-06-29 18:06:50
I'm prepared for a long bear market, but due to vastly increased familiarity and ease of use compared to 2014, i think this one will be condensed. I doubt it will take 1100 days to get back to the ath. Especially if institutional investors finally begin their entrance.

Holy mother of God

Depends what you're trying to show. If you're measuring the impact a country is having on bitcoin trading then total volume makes more sense. If you're trying to measure market penetration in countries then per capita makes sense.

Facebook, YouTube, Twitter came out right after each other in 04, 05, and 06 respectively.

Lol, coinbase is the safest crypto exchange there is. Banks are terrified.
@_date: 2019-08-30 22:50:33
Is this where the citadels will be built?
@_date: 2019-10-04 00:09:24
The fact that it's worth over $8,000 is mindblowing. If it can reach $8,000 why not $250,000?
@_date: 2019-08-15 19:08:49
I'll say $44,900

Crypto is more like 1989 internet than 1999. 1999 internet had massive mainstream penetration already.
@_date: 2019-02-09 04:54:20
Heard about it back around 2011. Didn't take it seriously until 2017. Have been an investor in the company square since shortly after its ipo. When it was first announced they were going to allow bitcoin on their cash app i looked into bitcoin more closely. That's when it clicked and i knew it was the future.
@_date: 2019-02-14 04:27:32
That looked really confusing honestly. Not mainstream ready in that form.
@_date: 2019-02-07 15:18:55
Its a good point about good or bad news not affecting the price. In the past week or so we've had both the biggest exchange in Canada exit scam and Jack Dorsey shill bitcoin heavily. Price has barely budged.
@_date: 2019-02-06 03:30:20
Im so high right now that all makes perfect sense.

There is resistance at the previous ath in every market.

It took the Dow 25 years to recover so not sure you're going to make anyone feel better with this post.
@_date: 2019-02-07 11:05:12
Yea when people compare crypto to the 90s internet bubble i assume they weren't there. Internet was much further along. We knew all of this was coming it was just a matter of time. The more apt comparison is the 80s, maybe early 90s.
@_date: 2019-12-14 21:12:29
Even if the event is known, sell pressure will decrease after the halvening from miners being able to dump less btc on the market every day.
@_date: 2019-12-13 03:25:40
Now that every YouTuber has turned bearish I expect it to go up.

For long term investing it's one of the best as it takes emotion out of it.
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:15:44
Perfectly said. 4k or 10k it's all the same to me at this point.
@_date: 2019-01-28 22:08:21
Easiest is coinbase. Just go to their website and follow the steps.

There's a ton of people in the finance sector in nyc. I think some of the marketing is towards them.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:33:48
Yea the guy was right on the money about it being a bubble. And did so while still saying he believes in the technology and that it'll recover eventually.
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:00:32
Very few people are in crypto, it's still us speculators. By the time majority are entering it will be significantly more stable.
@_date: 2019-09-02 16:04:33
I think it's viable as an investment for at least another decade, maybe two. Btc has a 1% penetration rate, it's still early days in the big picture.

Summer was supposed to be bullish. It was a terrible June. July started off promising but is back in the shitter. For now we just wait while the bear slaps us around some more.

It's happening isn't it
@_date: 2019-09-11 15:33:18
Beautiful thing about bitcoin is that it rewards greed and it makes the network stronger.
@_date: 2019-09-27 18:14:43
Yea even 10% seems high. I would've guessed 2-3%.
@_date: 2019-05-10 15:58:27
Never a good idea to buy high sell low. If you don't want to hold alts then wait for the ratio to bounce back and sell into btc.
@_date: 2019-05-12 00:30:45
If this is institutions buying than any perceived support or resistance is paper thin.
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:37:51
Sellers exhausted, start of new bull market.
