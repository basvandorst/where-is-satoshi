The kind that knows what fees I will be charged when I buy something? Unlike you or OP apparently.

Screw wikileaks and their russian handlers. Wikileaks has been shown to be a russian intelligence operation and should be ignored.

You should get another wallet besides blockchain asap. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:30:55
I suggest an Electrum wallet

No, they can't, and don't. You get taxed when you the sell the asset back to fiat AFTER it has appreciated, not when you send the money to the exchange. And then you just get taxed the difference between the buy price and the sale price. If you buy for 1k, then sell for 2k, you pay tax on the 1k difference.

I would go with electrum for a desktop or check various mobile ones so you have control of your bitcoins, not blockchain.

It took me a week+ to get my bank account verified. This was about 6 weeks ago.

There are several sites which average the exchanges. I normally look at coinsalad. As far as others - it will depend on where whoever is quoting the price got their info.

We can't get the gop voters to agree to turn them off.

Who wants to support a russian intelligence operation? Because that's all that wikileaks is now.
I sure as fuck don't.

You go open account at the new exchange and then I would transfer bitcoin to personal wallet then to new exchange. Cash is on you.

Then you need to talk to a UK tax person.

You move them to gdax and from there to an electrum wallet

He will be throwing his money away. You can't fix stupid.
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:42:44
You bought from coinbase which DOES NOT USE current price. You need to read about their fees.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:15:52
Thx for this! excellent info.
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:43:54
Or maybe you could get a clue and learn about the exchange BEFORE you buy.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:58:13
I use gemini for this reason.

Try coinsalad dot com. They average about 20 exchanges and give info like volume and buy/sell price
