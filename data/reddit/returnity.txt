Tether.to directs them to a friendly partner exchange where they can unload on another bagholder. Good luck getting Tether/BF themselves to redeem shit.

Last time I checked, BitFinex doesn't have carrier battlegroups, thermonuclear warheads, or global petrodollar reserve currency status to back up that fiat of theirs.

Yeah it's an IOU they specifically stipulate they'll never have to redeem for real money. Or if you're a US citizen, an IOU they won't even issue you -- you've gotta acquire it from the market. It's more like you sold your BTC for 10 sticks and now you need to convince me why I should accept sticks at a 1:1 parity for USD.

USD/crypto pairs would diverge sharply from USDT/crypto pairings when the faith in Tether's peg finally breaks. You can already see this kind of thing happening in a different way, on a smaller scale, when the price drops hard -- BTC prices on Tether exchanges sink lower than real fiat exchanges because the price of tether gets dragged higher than 1:1 by the buying pressure from traders taking shelter in the Tether bunker.
In a Tether crash, the USDT price of cryptos would be skyrocketing, but on real fiat exchanges massive selling pressure would tank the same crypto's USD price simultaneously. Note this is actually the opposite direction of the divergence I mentioned above, because in this latter scenario, the peg isn't stretching because everyone is trying to get *into* Tether, it's collapsing because they want *out*.

You're talking about two different things. There will always be price inefficiencies across cryptoexchanges so long as the market runs on centralized exchanges with isolated liquidity pools. Established markets index liquidity across order books at all participating exchanges, so when you place a bid, you can be matched with an ask on *any* exchange's order book not just the local book at your exchange. This does not occur in crypto, partially because of the difficulties with fiat offramps. 
These fiat offramps are what I'm referring to when I say that during panic selloffs, you can see the USDT price of BTC (&amp; ETH sometimes) is lower across the board at Tether exchanges than fiat ones because the value of USDT floats above $1.00 when under heavy buying pressure like you see in an abrupt market downturn that sends people seeking shelter from volatility.
If you look back to the steepest part of the drop from the correction, you can check the USD/USDT exchange rate on Kraken (IIRC it got as high at $1.04-05 USD per $1 USDT) and then at the same time point, check out prices across fiat-only gateway (GDAX/Kraken/Gemini) vs. 
prices in USDT for BTC &amp; ETH on fiatless exchanges (Binance/Bittrex/Poloniex). You will see that the prices drop further on the USDT exchanges, because of this subtle stretching of Tether's 1:1 peg. 
I didn't include BitFinex in the list of Tether-onlyu exchanges because a) they do accept fiat *deposits* just NOT *withdrawals* &amp; b) Tether sends all of the ~$100M new USDT/day they print directly to BitFinex for broader distribution. Because a good chunk of those Tethers fuel new Margin Longs on BFX, this exchange's behaviors is kind of a hybrid of the fiat exchanges &amp; the fiatless -- I've actually used the fact that it stays correlated with other fiat exchanges but exhibits higher volatility to magnify profits on trades when I see a high-probability move. I just wouldn't keep any money on their platform any longer than it takes to grab some quick profits.
Please note I'm not saying anything *bad* is implied by this flexing of the peg or the price difference that sometimes emerges at Tether exchanges, it makes perfect sense &amp; I expect DAI and other transparent, fully-backed stablecoins that will replace Tether would exhibit similar market-driven price action. I just wanted to offer an example that shows that already Tether's peg is somewhat fluid, and the 1:1 balance on Kraken's USD/USDT market is also known to be managed by a trading bot. 
EDIT: Also, if you want to see an exchange which offers BTC/USD pair *and* BTC/Tether pair, check out [EXMO]( -- the USD pair there enjoys a ~$1000 price premium over the USDT pair. I know it's a low volume exchange, but I see it in my arbitrage spreadsheets &amp; I thought it was interesting.

Exactly, only this is the conversation that you need to have with the BitCoin Core devs, and if they could just communicate this coherently to the community in a way people would trust, we'd be able to move forward like we all seem to agree we should. 
We all know a huge number of potentially useful solutions to the totally-fixable problem we've got here, so why not just start fixing it already in nearly any way at all, because all this talking around in circles while we wait for 8 people in the Core to actually DO something is kind of absurdly pointless by now. I'm all for more talking about the specifics of solutions that are more correct than others *IF* it gets people on the same page as those of us who 'get it', so we can just go back to working on the project... but I'm getting tired of going nowhere waiting for more people get on this bandwagon when we've been waiting at this particular bus stop for *far* too long already. That's a frustration I think a lot of us are feeling in some way right now.
@_date: 2015-12-29 05:35:33
I deeply respect your well-thought out views and your focus on being part of the solution, rather than part of the problem &amp; that's why I know you recognize all the same frustrating irony that I see too. I've been caught up in these negative feedback loops before, and they're a real bitch to get out of... When you're working on a collaborative project together on the internet, trying to create a trustless peer-to-peer network in a vacuum where one has never existed, you have to trust people to move the project forward with you, because it's far too big for one person to do it alone... but the problem with these types of collaborative projects is that, as they get bigger, they tend to lose track of their original ideas in a way that makes them hopelessly pointless after a certain point, breaking the original contract and violating the trust that allowed it to develop as far as it did. If that happens to an extreme, the bottom drops out of a project/security/cryptocurrency in a way that's directly linked to the trust/faith/commitment/risk-to-gain relationships between the core people working together on it, like any other utility/value indicator graphed on a chart.
I really do think the fundamental concept that underpins BTC will allow us to break out of that negative feedback loop of internet-trustlessness, but talking about the problem on reddit is still part of the problem, because reddit is hopelessly broken just like the rest of the internet, the same way it requires some amount of trust to have any productive transactions/communications, which is the exact reason we *need* Bitcoin in the first place. The whole project is either the most brilliant idea in the universe or the most elaborate troll ever perpetrated on the internet, and either way Satoshi Nakamoto is my hero, but I'm still holding long on the underlying idea even while the current system of Core developers keeps letting us all down repeatedly. 
@_date: 2015-12-31 15:33:40
I agree with your premise, but I'm wondering, what would the alternative main drivers of BTC price be in your theory?
@_date: 2015-12-27 15:35:55
You've made a huge contribution -- the question now, the most important one I didn't see you raise, is *how* can we, as a user-community, act effectively and decisively to impose our will onto the Core devs, assuming we *do* agree with and consent to your proposal, which I assume that any rational individual, no-matter their specific positions or wants from the BTC economy, would agree &amp; consent to? 
In other words, as Jeff Garzik has noted, the Core devs cannot be trusted to be rational &amp; act in the best interests of the whole ecosystem, so given that premise, how should those who support this solution act in the constraints of BTC's current game theory to promulgate this maximal utility/agreeability solution you've posted for us all to rally around?
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:17:51
While I appreciate all of Bitfinexed's work, and find it some of the most interesting reading on cryptotwitter, I'm curious about the links you suggest w/ BCH? How do you think it helps BCH to RT anti-Tether "FUD" when the BCH price is essentially controlled by BTC market when its not being intentionally pumped?
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:53:56
How reassuring. They have 'a' bank account with some unknown balance. Well, guess the FUD campaign failed guise! Call off the shitposters and shills, it's all over.

They aren't minor except in the sense that their volume is insanely inflated by wash trading which their trading engine *still* permits despite it being open knowledge for years.
