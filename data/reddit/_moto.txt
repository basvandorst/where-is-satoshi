That doesn't sound accurate? No way is it more circulated than GBP.

Thanks Bitfinex
@_date: 2019-07-21 15:52:37
Breath and relax. I like a lot of crypto including BTC, BCH &amp; ETH. In my experience this community is a lot less accommodating - your response is quite a good example.
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:37:06
Bitfinex attempts to drive the price up or down with it's self-issued USDT.

Be careful, there is reason to suspect any exchange that relies heavily on USDT.

Nah, that's that the upvote &amp; downvote buttons are for mate. You're turning more people away from Bitcoin with censorship style posts like this. Bitcoin &amp; Bitcoin Cash communities are as bad as each other. Neither are superior.

You can post whatever you want in r/btc but the same can't be said for here. He may be a mod but at least you can post whatever you like
@_date: 2018-08-02 20:23:54
You clearly don't understand decentralization and the ability for people to create and promote their own communities, projects and, yes, cryptocurrencies. Your desperation to wall-off all other projects is the exact opposite of this. It's meaningless whether the products have merit or not - it's not up to you to decide.

I struggle to see the "scam" part. It may be annoying, but both Bitcoin's share the same history. At this point I hate both fucking chains.
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:02:05
And Bitcoin has been down 70% or so? Get off your high horse.
@_date: 2018-05-28 23:02:15
I really do fail to see the "scam" part. Some people disagreed with others and forked, so what?

Tether losing it's dollar peg. Be really careful if you're holding USDT right now.  
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:53:57
This. Bitcoin Cash is gaining a little momentum and could cause uncertainty.
Get yourself signed up to the main exchanges and get your dollars ready. I would consider a portfolio consisting of Bitcoin, Ethereum &amp; possibly IOTA &amp; Litecoin.

- Bitfinex print fake money
- Bitfinex buy Bitcoin with fake money to push price of Bitcoin up
- Bitfinex sell Bitcoin for real money
- Repeat. Print more fake money if necessary.
In reality it's much more complex, probably involving multiple exchanges, multiple cryptocurrencies, manipulated lending fees and fraudulent margin trading.
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:10:13
I agree with the last part. Looking at the trading volumes, the demand is real.
Bitcoin/USD**T** has consistently the highest volume of all trading pairs. A significant portion of demand comes from a pinky-promise dollar token that can be printed without any accountability.
How can this not worry you? The onus is on Bitfinex to prove they are running a legit operation. Until then I will remain to be skeptical and criticise their operation.

This week's developments do nothing to affect or otherwise deter Bitfinex's claims to funds in Poland or anywhere else. We will continue to work to recover all funds for and on behalf of our stakeholders.
Bitfinex/Tether can't get access to fiat.
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:51:07
Why then, can some exchanges hold USD whereas other CAN'T?
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:38:42
Uhhh, if the US or EU governments close down the fiat on-ramps and off-ramps then crypto will have a very bad time.
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:13:35

“Nah, they should buy another crypto for that.”

This statements are not compatible. As Bitcoin is supposedly free and decentralized then anyone can fork and call it *whatever* they like.

"Lightning is not secure" *can* be an opinion. It's worrying you don't see that.
@_date: 2018-11-11 20:37:46
Yeah, I guess I understand, thanks for the explanation. One unit of currency to conduct business in would get confusing fast.
It would be preferable that I when I visit a furniture store I have to use one type of currency, and when I visit a Starbucks another type of currency. And probably another type of currency for tipping a Twitch streamer.

Probably not a real buy. Just Bitfinex wash trading to jack the price up.

Nothing wrong with taking some time to cool-off and be patient with fiat.
I am worried a crackdown on exchanges &amp; USDT will be the catalyst for an almighty fall.

Avoid USDT.
@_date: 2017-10-19 11:03:28
True, my guess is that the average crypto user would want the most stable and least risky crypto in the event of controversy, so probably Bitcoin &amp; Ether.

No worries, I agree regarding Twitter. However, that chart posted is factual as there does appear to be a correlation between self-issued fake-dollars and price movement. You can nudge/encourage the price of Bitcoin quite easily with $450 million of monopoly money :)
I have been investing since 2013 and fear another MT. GOX scenario. This is extremely unfortunate because I adore the Bitcoin tech and the opportunities it brings.

To be fair Transferwise is one of the best options for fiat currency transfers. I get your point though.
@_date: 2017-10-19 08:41:20
There's a strong argument that Bitcoin won't immediately crash in the event of a USDT scandal as a lot of people will want to sell USDT for Bitcoin at ANY price.
Therefore we could see a huge spike in price before a colossal fall (in a similar fashion of MT GOX collapse pushing the price to $1000 then back to $200).

Out of interest, why did you upload this to Shopify's server?
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:06:42
Absolutely. Manipulation via USDT on Bitfinex which has overwhelmingly the most volume.
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:10:40
Because it wasn't a real trade. It was Bitfinex wash trading i.e. trading with themselves.
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:31:48
Do not do this.
I believe we are on a knife edge thanks to massive exchange manipulation.
If you're sure you want to invest $25k, I would suggest getting the money and being *extremely* patient. Wait for the almighty crash/correction that is possibly on the horizon.
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:13:42
Nothing wrong with some patience.
I believe the current mania is fuelled by exchange manipulation (Bitfinex &amp; USDT). The SEC will continue to take down exchanges deemed to be violating US &amp; international laws.
@_date: 2017-10-30 08:41:11
Don't do it. It's plausible the price is being manipulated by the biggest exchange (Bitfinex) via USDT (which Bitfinex owns).
