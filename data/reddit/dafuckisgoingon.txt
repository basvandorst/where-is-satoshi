that's not how it works  
day traders win about as often as lottery winners  
the only people that make money day trading are those collecting fees, they make money no matter how the market is doing

it eventually dies anyway with coins being lost  
I suppose they could recover coins not used in X number of years, but no one is going to go for that until no more can be made
@_date: 2015-01-04 22:24:57
based on what facts?
@_date: 2015-01-04 22:21:32
thanks for your made up number, mr speculator
@_date: 2015-01-04 22:19:44
yup.  it finally went down and people saw it as a chance to get out.  then it spiked up and they said FUCK THIS
@_date: 2015-01-30 23:53:11
when they start running out, they will
@_date: 2015-01-04 22:22:24
difficulty actually went down the last few times
@_date: 2015-01-04 22:11:16
lol, such speculation  
how did you come to these total guesses?
@_date: 2015-01-04 22:23:02
but people will see it as their chance to get it, and it won't decrease at all

you dont own a smart phone?  
get a circle account

they've almost halved in cost since september
@_date: 2015-01-04 22:12:20
supply decreases over time as people lose coins and they are unrecoverable FOREVER
@_date: 2015-01-04 22:25:31
why else do you invest? for shits and giggles?  
getting broke quick is a LOT worse than getting rich quick
@_date: 2015-01-14 04:36:20
there's a lot of auto sell options kicking in at 300 and 250, hitting 200 will cause an even larger sell off
@_date: 2015-01-14 04:40:18
That person would actually own closer to 100% with all the coins lost forever at that point
@_date: 2015-01-04 22:17:13
its miners freaking out.  
difficulty rose exponentially recently and cause people to jump ship, then for the first time ever, difficulty actually decreased.   people saw this as their time to exit, especially with the huge difficulty increases coming up.
@_date: 2015-01-04 22:09:53
the difficulty has actually gone DOWN recently
