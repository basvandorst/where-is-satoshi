Yes you can. Corporations do it all the time, as do banks.

Notice how the bank actually isn't trading bitcoin? Of course they aren't. The bank is worried about *where the money came from*. Where (and how) did they get that amount of money from coinbase? Did they generate it through trading? Is someone sending stolen BTC to their coinbase wallet and then having this person cash it out for them?
The bank only cares that the money came from coinbase because (for whatever reason) they think such transactions are fraudulent.

Wrong on so many levels. Sending &gt;2k will get a suspicious activity report filed, sending 10k hits the Bank Secrecy Act. You won't **see** what flags are raised, but they will be there.

This is not quite correct. Forked coins are treated same as mining, as income.  The forking network gifted you this asset (based on your previous balance on the old chain). Airdrops are *supposed* handled the same way.

This was just made into a law with the new tax bill.

This is the real reason. I've had banks shut me down for less dubious things, their Anti-Money Laundering sensitivity can be high especially at the local level. 
I would open up accounts with three different credit unions, or start dealing with wire-transfers from GDAX. Also, shell corporations are pretty much gold for avoiding such restrictions on consumer accounts. People don't blink if you send/receive five digits of wire transfers through a business checking account. Do that multiple times on a personal account and you'll get a talking to.

I just lost my 'funds held by a third party have been lost' virginity. Maybe I'll take a nap and feel better.

Without contingency plans, sure. This isn't my first rodeo. I appreciate your concern though. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:39:04
Yes I have an idea. That's why I run all of my large monetary movements through a business checking account; it's not suspicious for businesses to do that. Have little activity on a personal checking account amd then start to throw around 2k+ transfers and wires willy nilly? They'll get filed, especially if you're at a local bank with overly aggressive fraud prevention procedures.

I'd be interested in 
A. your contingency plans
B. if this whole living thing isn't your first rodeo
in regards to living forever.

I wish more people understood this. The IRS **is not** a court system. They don't have to prove where and how your money behaved; **you do**. You have to prove their assumptions *wrong*.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:45:10
Bank Secrecy Act + Anti-Money Laundering regulations.
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:37:52
Hmmm. You could make a good argument for the division, although considering how different the political ideologies of the two chains are... I doubt the IRS cares about that actually. Last I read up on it (when ETC split from ETH) the safe(est) way to deal with it was to treat it as mining, although what's safe and what's necessary are frequently two different things in the crypto tax world. I hadn't considered that angle, thanks for the article.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:28:27
Haven't had any problems thus far.

Recent algos are memory hard and don't stress your cards. My cards run at 65C, it's not like 2013.

That chart could use a few more date labels.

I'd like a pointer as to what point in time that intent was voiced. None of it is in the original whitepaper. I'm not saying it's bad for things to change and adapt to the needs of the users, only that second layer solutions weren't included in the original vision.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:12:28
This is not true. [Some assets are zero sum games, but not all of them are]( Consider the hypothetical; would LN be developed without the current BTC capital flows? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:33:21
I thought you said there were no changes. How can those changes not justify a price change if there aren't any changes?
You're moving the goal posts on me, don't have proper punctuation in your posts, are an account for one week, ignored even recent history (or didn't research it at all). Maybe you'll want to do some research outside of the daily thread.

No, it's different for every bank. They paid you $100 for a checking account because (probably) in order get that bonus, they trained you to behave a certain way (direct deposit most likely, and usually a certain amount of debit card purchases). Most people won't artificially smurf these bonuses (but some do), and so the $100 is really the cost of acquiring a customer. Considering the average [lifetime value of a customer to a bank]( $100 is pretty cheap, even with extrapolated attrition rates.

BTC absolutely has changed in the past 12 months. A contentious hard fork separated those with opposing opinions and allowed them to go their separate ways (mostly). Segwit is an change to the protocol, gets rid of transaction malleability and makes 2nd layer solutions easier. Lightning Network nodes now both actually exist and continue to grow at an impressive rate. None of those things had happened a year ago. BTC faces lots of competition, both within the crypto world and outside of it, but that doesn't mean nothing has changed. Far from it.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:31:03
I didn't say they did. The question was 'has BTC itself fundamentally changed the last 12 months?' not 'what precise multiplier are these changes worth'.

Enough said.

Not true, that depends entirely upon their current liquidity and the reserve ratio. I've seen banks actively close accounts because they've had too much in reserve and it was bad for their numbers.
