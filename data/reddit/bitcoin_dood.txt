Great episode, I'm really excited about seeing the release of ROKOS flavors. Can't wait to see what additional coins and wallets they add.

I didn't know anyone picked up the project. I'll definitely have to look into this one. With all the current privacy issues, open source projects are definitely a step in the right direction.

They have a really good security department. I had a similar situation. I was having a hard time getting verified and someone from their security department found me at an acquaintances. When I asked how they got the number they said it was associated with a business I registered and I remembered that the business name was registered to the upstairs apartment. It was just really weird that they called at that particular moment. Once I got registered though, I've not had a single problem since. Coinbase used to cancel my account once a month because of KYC discrepancies. When they finally canceled me because my trading account was registered with a DBA I quit them for good and have used Gemini since.

Sad Cynagenmod discontinued development. I imagine people will start looking for open source alternatives to android. Best way to stick it to em, is hurt them in the pocket book. Stop using Verizon, and start looking of open source alternatives for phones. Something, I've been thinking about for awhile now. Crazy times we're living in.

One of my favorite shows for getting up to date news on what's happening in the crypto space. Great twitter feed too.

Gold almost always goes up when the market goes down. A lot of investors use gold as a safe haven. Gold will always be gold and maintains its value. It's a great hedge when the market is in a down trend.

Scary indeed and they probably vote too.

Circle.com is pretty quick. You
 still have to register and show proof of ID but you should be able to buy same day with a credit card. Obtaining your first bitcoin can be daunting, and it really can be a hassel the first time. Good luck and welcome to bitcoin.

It's a combination of the fork, fear of bitcoinXT, and a huge sell off last night on one of the exchanges.

I love these! Thank you so much. I'll be using these often!

This is definitely starting to look ugly. If support doesn't hold here, $5,000 could be a reality. I've been buying all the way down since about $9,500. If 2017 taught us anything it's that the future of BTC looks really bright.

LMAO, that was the first thing that popped into my mind when I seen the Ellen DeGeneres clip. It seems like a combination too of the dotcom boom, and a huge part of the population not understanding the technology or what it actually means for future society.

Switched over to Gemini a little over a year ago and have never looked back. I also got tired of logging into my Coinbase account and having all kinds of verification problems. Got verified with Gemini once, and never had a problem since. Anytime I have a minor issue their support team is second to none. IMHO they may very well have the best support team in crypto. Not shilling for Gemini or anything, but the Winklevii are running a top notch exchange and setting a new standard for excellence... Wish they had a little more trade volume, but I think as more and more people discover their excellence, trade volume will follow!

I had so many problems with Coinbase. Every couple months there was a new reason my account got locked. Always compliance issues. I started using Circle with no problems, then eventually switched to Gemini and I've been really happy over there. Coinbase needs to get it together. Far to many legitimate users have problems over there.

LMAO, I was just having this conversation with a twitter friend in direct message. Totally reminds me of the .com bubble especially with all these ICO offers. 
The .com boom helped push the internet into mainstream use. The same thing could be happening with cryptocurrency right now. Definitely an exciting time to be involved in this industry.
