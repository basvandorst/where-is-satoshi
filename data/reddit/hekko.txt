As Bitcoin doesn't legally exist to the Feds anyway, they don't need to be involved. ; )
Good score on the found coins, btw. I heard someone say once that the only thing worse than formatting a hard drive with 10,000 btc on it is having your wife know about it.

There's no profit in rubbing shit on yourself. There's much profit in skirting the IRS.

So what? The law is an ass.

$100 seems like a lot of money now but it won't seem like much in a year or so. I'll suppose that you, like many of us, have mindlessly spent $5 at least 20 times in our lives on something that brought no return. Imagine that this $100 is $5 wasted twenty times in row and don't worry about gains or losses. It's already worth more than you've put into it and it holds some hope of return.
If you positively can't afford to lose the $100, sell off $100 worth and hold the rest. I think you might kick yourself in the pants in the future if you did, but that's also part of the risk in any venture. ; )

Every human being has the right to tell others to fuck The Man whenever possible.

Easier, better deal than mtgox is here:
I've bought coins from him, never sold to him. I've never had an issue  with his service.

I'd rather sell at a small discount and know I'm getting paid quickly and easily rather than run the risk of the capricious ways of mtgox, a possible hold up of funds and the stress and headache of worrying about it all. 
It's worth 2%.

That's assuming OP wants thousands of dollars showing up on his bank records.

Caveat emptor should be everyone's rule  If someone runs their life off some unknown anon's words on the net, there's not a lot anyone can do about that.
I'm certainly not going to tailor what I believe to fit someone else's agenda, especially if that agenda involves compliance with an unjust agency.

He doesn't have to sell them all at once. There are no fees for company check, standard ACH or PM payout. 
Still a better deal than mtgox and their AML bs.
