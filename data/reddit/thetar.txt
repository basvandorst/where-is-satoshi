It is also odd that they are limiting the whole thing to 60 people

Yes, I understand this, but with the use of a satoshi you could tie a timestamped proof to an event, agreement, image, etc. There has to be a ton of different things you could build from this ability. These are the type of ideas I want to explore, is it a digital betting "I Sam Peters hereby bet Peter Samsmith $10 that by 2015 I will be a millionaire." and have it timestamped and verified by that timestamped hash. That way Peter Samsmith has proof that Sam Peters made that bet, etc.

He should pay the expenses; after all, he has TONS of our bitcoin.

This goes with my QR code tattoos for strippers idea!

I for one have no problem paying taxes, I pay enough with my income to hire a few full time employees with, I invest in the stock market and pay my taxes on that. Taxes should be viewed as a reward for making money, the more taxes you pay, the more you made and you should be proud of yourself for being an earner.

Well done!

This is true, but the other locations it is cheaper, go to any WalMart and look at what it costs to send money, it is cheaper to send in the US, and not surprisingly it is dirty cheap to send money to Mexico.

I think what he is saying is, when you buy a house, you can not move said house, therefore, assuming you want to live in that house, you would have to then live in South Africa. 
I think this was an attempt to be funny.

I clicked "upvote" isn't that enough dude!

Good point, I plan to add a very simple timeline (section off the 3 days) once I get the data.
currently it is sense like 6am
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:37:31
this is 
I just wish it was on more then mtgox feed, I might whip up my own site for the monitor, and make it public, I will post it if I do.

This brings me back to a fair I was at, you had to buy tickets to then go and buy beer with tickets. it was the dumbest thing ever. I had to give USD for tickets, so I could then buy something with tickets. Isn't what you suggest the online version of buying something to buy something else?
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:05:07
No worries, I did, I am just sad from the drop, I am playing it like a game of black jack, all or $0. But after today feel a strip club might have been a better use of the $903.03 :)
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:29:28
If it hits $500USD, I am buying more for sure.
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:28:17
Yes, this will work if someone tips you though that wallet, then you can message the account with the subject withdraw and the message 
"+BITCOIN_ADDRESS_GOES_HERE $1"
and get the tips put into your withdraw address 
*edit if you message for a wallet you can also manage it though blockchain.

I like the buy high and sell low.. :)
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:29:28
thanks for the feedback, i like the simplistic chart, why would you add a timeframe? my plan is the have 3 days of progress (right now I have a cron job saving that data to flat files, so I only have one day) I might add dividers for each day, but is it important to know when something was? I am more worried about where it is going and currently is at, etc.
alerts might be cool, not for my use case, but I might think about how I would add something like that. How would you want to be notified?

Funny you say that, I use [HideMyAss]( as a VPN when I use bitcoins to increase it. :)
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:55:16
i understand the risks, just wanted to make sure i wasn't posting my bitcoin to someone.. i have mistakenly posting the manage link on a craigslist ad before, but that didnt cost me $500-$1000 :)
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:19:16
Alright, 
In the lower right you can now enter how many you have :)
@_date: 2013-12-18 00:56:30
I know I will continue to use Bitcoin without worry, between all my offline wallets and [HideMyAss]( anonymous VPN I hope that it is good enough that it would take someone too long to track me down. 
What are others doing to "cash and carry" Bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:45:55
thanks you
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:15:06
Spot on! This is something I am currently working on, it will then just track you portfolio value. Currently playing with coin bases API as well.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:05:34
thank you, this helps.

I thought the same thing when I bought Zillow stock, then two of the main share holders sold over 300k shares each within two weeks.. being educated about what you can see is sometimes only 10% of the risk.
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:30:40
guys, don't click this BS
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:38:32
that is guessing as much as the next guy and you know that.
@_date: 2013-12-18 03:48:17
This is why geeks should not sell to the general public. This is great for us geeks to see how everything works, but would scare the shit out of a "normal" human and make them never want to use bitcoins.. ever.
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:46:02
thank you

I am not sure I currently have access to this data on coinbase, I was also thinking bout a + or - of change since midnight, but than I would need local timezones, etc. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:31:36
My buddy bought at $500, and in 2 days it was at $1000, I was hoping for similar happiness.

Their API updates every minute, I ping and long every minute.

Note: Howard is no where near Milwaukee, and Fox 11 is Green Bay, WI based. Which is the city Howard is close to.

I will play with it later, right now focused on iOS. :)
@_date: 2013-12-11 01:15:38
what are the current steps of the bitcoin transaction? I thought you just made a hash for x bitcoins and they scan that hash (qr code)..
