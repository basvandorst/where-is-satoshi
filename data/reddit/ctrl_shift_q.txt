Quickly skimmed through the Google Cloud ToS and did not see anything that prohibited you from running a Bitcoin node. Your best bet would be contacting support.

Sorry, I don't understand. What is the point of this?

Litecoin, ZCash and Monero for example. Pretty much any crypto currency that isn't Bitcoin or whichever fork the person you are talking to considers to be Bitcoin.
