Bitcoin is the money they fear it is.

I think you just hooked another one.

iTunes competes with *free* BitTorrent music by offering a wider selection and technology platforms which enable viewing content on any of the user's devices.
Same principle applies here.

Great summary. I liked the Andreas vid also.

Better his own, than someone else's.

Very true. Even conservatives bash FOX these days.

Bitcoin is the slime mold of currency - it collectively finds a way.
@_date: 2014-01-11 04:24:53
That said, Bitcoin could be used as a way to *commoditize* social media attention. What if you had 100k people willing to advertise (whatever) for say, .00001 BTC. That's a lot of attention you could buy for a single coin.

I believe the internet has made those kind of nerds an endangered species.
@_date: 2014-01-21 19:27:49
Precisely. And there's nothing to stop people from moving to an altcoin if/when they abuse this power.
Bitcoin is just *CryptoCurrency 1.0* (figuratively speaking)
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:39:31
Precisely the opposite, good sir.
It is now that we need him...the most.
@_date: 2014-01-30 04:10:04
DFNTLY SRS!

Litecoins are going to be the next coin to "pop."

BTC isn't a company. You're also leaving out the historic upswing.
@_date: 2013-10-02 17:56:46
Sorry to hear that.

Watch and see what happens. I don't think it's time to panic. Hell, might be a good opportunity to buy some cheap. I've seen plenty of drops happen to silver over the last 3 years.

I like this, it's an awesome idea.
I looked at the prices on the LTC cards, they seem a little high. I understand it's a new business, but unless the price of LTC goes up significantly, these just don't seem cost effective.
That said, great work, I love to see any idea that supports these new currencies!

TL; DR - Federal agencies efforts vs. Conficker were a bureaucratic failure. Civilians with industry expertise made them look like fools. Bitcoin uses the same basic mechanisms as other threats they have been unable to defeat.

...and hold out until the government accepts it.

Thanks for sharing, Gavin. Great story.
I bet he will be even more shocked when he learns who you are.

I love the phrase "that much coin." Epic.

Any net-based services are perfect for Bitcoin. 
I don't think you're viewing it wrong at all...
Love your username, btw.
@_date: 2013-12-31 18:45:20
Good explanation. It'd be nice to see someone do an investing series tailored towards Crypto Coins...
@_date: 2013-12-27 16:56:55
Laws can only govern Bitcoin and its price in the *short term*, because Crypto-business and Crypto-capital will seek the least regulated environment.

BI succeeds *in spite* of this moron.

Food stamps are already like this. Though some allow for a limited *cash back* which everyone then uses to buy booze or smokes.

@_date: 2013-10-02 17:59:55
We'll see. I've only seen small fluctuations.
