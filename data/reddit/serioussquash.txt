For the median transaction size of 258 bytes, this results in a fee of 25,800 satoshis (0.14$).

Is VR porn as good as they say?
@_date: 2016-03-03 15:21:57
Raising the block limit allows more people to use bitcoin and reduces tx fees. That's pretty damn good for such a small trivial change.
@_date: 2017-02-09 04:20:41
With a hard fork you choose your fork, with a soft fork you have no choice.
@_date: 2016-03-04 14:44:39
The problem is not the attack, attacks will happen all the time.
The problem is insufficient extra capacity above what is used by real users.
@_date: 2016-03-01 16:14:43
That being said, transactions are starting to get really expensive (~0.13 USD for priority). That capacity increase would bring down the price and make bitcoin better for the people.
@_date: 2016-03-04 11:21:26
I agree, but seems like everyone is so scared of even the most trivial hard forks. That's why hard forking to 2 MB is so important - it will be a non event, nothing bad will happen and bitcoin will prove to able to change!
@_date: 2016-03-05 10:51:50
Very good point! 1 MB is completely arbitrary. If 2 MB is so bad, then 0.5 MB should be much much better, but it's not. Because 2 MB is not bad at all!
@_date: 2016-03-06 13:27:09
Because it's an extremely important issue at the heart of bitcoin: can bitcoin change and improve or will it stagnate and die to altcoins.
@_date: 2016-03-07 09:33:31
Fees are increasing, but they are still not high!
0.04 USD fee will get it confirmed in 1-2 blocks.
Run a full bitcoin classic node and vote with your hashing power by mining on pools that support the policies you want. Too early to give up!
@_date: 2016-03-01 17:22:25
True! However, when fees were around 0.02, you could just always pay double to be safe and ignore the issue. If fees get to ~0.20, paying double is not an option any more (too expensive).
@_date: 2017-03-25 12:01:27
If you buy bitcoin now, after the hard fork you will have money on both chains. Now might be the best time to buy.
Hard forking is the way forward. Let's split and create amazing stuff, make the world a better place.
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:38:47
This is a trillion dollar question.
Core could solve the problem of congestion tomorrow by suggesting a 2 MB hard-fork. But they won't. Why?
@_date: 2016-03-04 10:49:36
Assuming 90% legit user transactions attacker only needs to spam 10% to kill the system.
If we raised the blocklimit to 2 MB, attacker would need to spam 110%. 11 times more expensive to attack the system!! In addition, this would allow more real bitcoin users in the future.
It's extremely important to have spare capacity in case there's increased demand for bitcoin txs by real users.
@_date: 2016-01-18 12:24:10
IF contraversial fork succeeds, then it will not be contraversial, it will be consensus.
@_date: 2016-01-14 14:00:50
Users will have to educate themselves and make a decision which fork to support. That makes bitcoin a strong decentralized system.
@_date: 2016-01-20 00:03:57
Bitstamp is the best. They have publicly supported BIP101 and now 2 MB blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-22 20:26:19
That's why I wrote "suggesting". The code could be provided as an option.
@_date: 2016-01-20 01:00:16
Software wallets with good backup methods are the best. If you leave your bitcoin on an exchange, you don't technically own it, they do.
Some good options are Electrum and Mycelium. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 17:04:36
I run a full node at home.
Average bandwidth of the node is very low. Peak bandwidth is solved by compact blocks and xthin blocks. ISPs are offering plans of 1 Gbit/s. 20 MB block limit would be fine for me today.
Harddrives are cheap. So again, ~20 MB block limit is doable for me today.
1 MB today is malicious as it limits the number of people that can use bitcoin. What about the 6 billion unbanked people?
@_date: 2017-03-30 16:48:40
I agree that the current fighting and 1MB limit is stopping the price from rising, however:
- Scenario (1) can be solved by hard-forking with merged mining. It's a friendly divorce where both chains get full hashpower and full security. Core chain will have segwit, other chain will have big blocks. Win-win. Price before fork goes to the moon, because after fork you have units in both chains. Nice!
- In scenario (2) segwit gets activated, we have a modest transaction capacity increase. Price to the moon.
- In scenario (3) we get a transaction capacity increase and proof that bitcoin has decentralized government, huge confidence boost. Price to the moon.
All 3 scenarios lead to price going to the moon!
@_date: 2016-03-04 11:29:05
If by easy you mean 11 times more expensive, then I agree :)
@_date: 2016-06-11 03:35:05


Strangely, 11,300 satoshis = 0.066$ and not 0.04$, according to me.
@_date: 2016-06-11 03:46:31


11,300 satoshis = 0.066$ and not 0.04$, seems to be a bug on the website. For transactions with 2 inputs or multisig you get into &gt;0.10$ range, so is right.
@_date: 2016-06-14 13:11:32
Block fullness is irrelevant, because blocks will mostly always be full.
What really matters is transaction fees.
ATM for a 400 kB transaction priority fee is $0.17. I think that's too expensive and is hurting adoption.
@_date: 2016-06-30 23:14:36
I agree that blocks will (mostly) get spammed. This is why fees are the important metric to track.
There have been days when fees were high enough to drive legitimate users away. This is hurting adoption. Not enough seats on the bus!
@_date: 2016-06-11 03:49:32
$0.06 for 1 input, $0.12 for 2 inputs. It's not a far cry from $0.10, it's in the range.
@_date: 2016-06-17 06:46:39
And gold has suffered from this via fractional reserve banking.
The more bitcoin transactions on the main chain, the less fractional reserve banking we will have, the better for the whole world.
@_date: 2016-06-23 15:54:29
Only around 1 million people can have direct access to the bitcoin blockchain. If bitcoin does not scale, then it cannot be the global world money. If bitcoin will not be the global world money, then the current price is too high.
@_date: 2016-06-30 16:54:29
Market is reacting positively in hopes of additional transaction capacity, lower fees and successfully performed hard-fork. All these would be massively positive for bitcoin long-term.
@_date: 2016-06-22 15:00:07
This will dramatically improve block propagation and better block propagation means we can have bigger blocks without dangers of centralization.
@_date: 2017-08-25 08:54:17
If it is spam, then they are paying very very high fees which real users cannot afford any more (from my personal experience).
@_date: 2016-06-17 07:16:20


This is off-chain scaling.
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:33:53
If miners follow through with the NYA agreement (if they keep running  the fork will happen. Only unknown is the price of the segwit2x and segwit1x chains.

Fractional reserve banking developed with gold, so you are mistaken.

Will be hard to explain to them why their transactions are not getting confirmed and why tx fees are so high.
@_date: 2017-08-24 18:17:05
It's possible in the bitcoind/bitcoin-cli full node client:




@_date: 2016-06-17 07:07:05
If bitcoin is this store of wealth that is never transacted on the main chain, we will have fractional reserve banking all over again, just like with gold.
The way you prevent fractional reserve banking is by using the primary asset (bitcoin, gold) directly. For that we need mainchain tx capacity.
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:52:40
IMHO, it should have been done as a proper hard fork upgrade. Soft fork decision was wrong and history has proven it was wrong: the delays, now segwit2x will be a hard fork anyway, so nothing was gained by going soft-fork. But that is history now. The features of segwit are all rational and beneficial to bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-26 09:15:25
I run a full node at home. I have 100 Mbit/s upload and download link. Provider is offering to upgrade 600 Mbit/s for cheap, but I just don't need it. Bitcoin full node doesn't require it!
I've got the whole blockchain on an SSD and it's cheap. Will get cheaper and cheaper. Plenty of RAM for cache, too.
Now with compact blocks and xthin blocks the network could easily handle 20x increase in blockchain bloat **at no risk of centralization**.
It makes no sense to keep bitcoin artificially capped. The biggest risk to bitcoin at the moment is competition with other altcoins. You're subsidizing ethereum, litecoin and other shitcoins by capping bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-26 11:28:17
You can run a full node in a high bandwidth place and mine from a low bandwidth place. Mining (hashing) does not require high bandwidth.
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:41:04
Old unupgraded nodes see segwit as "anyone can spend", but all new nodes see it as breaking the rules and do not allow this. Majority of miners are also running the upgraded full nodes. You can only fool unupgraded nodes and those nodes have 0% hashpower.
For what it's worth, I am against Segwit, but logically it's not dangerous. It's safe. Just ugly.
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:20:13
A malicious miner could just create x "fake" transactions themselves and include those. There is no way to determine which transactions are "real", which are not.
@_date: 2017-08-10 13:42:14
To signal support for segwit2x, please run the btc1 codebase client.
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:28:48
I can, thank you for asking.
Let's take my particular case:
1 Gbit/s unlimited internet is 20 EUR/month (I would have internet at home anyway, so not all cost is due to bitcoin).
500 GB SSD (will last 2 years) is $150.
All other expenses are negligible. This is very affordable for a hobbyist.
@_date: 2016-06-10 14:44:52
Just choose a priority fee and your tx will confirm in the next 1-2 blocks.
Fees haven't increased much in the past months.

Bitmain's UAHF announcement that later became Bitcoin cash:

You have the timeline wrong. Segwit2x is a long planned original network upgrade, it is not another har dfork, it is the consensus hard fork.
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:48:28
New non mining full nodes all validate signatures. Anyone can spend does not apply if you run core client or btc1 client, which most people should be running! Miners are supposedly running btc1 codebase, which means they also validate signatures. All upgraded full nodes validate signatures. Basically the "anyone can spend" is not a problem same way it's not a problem with multisig. Multisig soft fork upgrade used the "anyone can spend" opcode, too.
@_date: 2017-08-10 09:35:07
It's not an attack, segwit2x is the compromise to unite the community. It adds onchain capacity and still keeps full nodes cheap. Win-win for all bitcoiners.
@_date: 2017-08-10 08:17:50
Run the btc1 codebase client if you want to support segwit2x with your full node.
@_date: 2017-08-10 09:56:32
Slightly more expensive, but still affordable for the average hobbyist.
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:40:06
S1X coins will be airdropped from the perspective of the segwit2x chain. It is all relative.
@_date: 2017-08-10 12:05:09
If the point of segwit1x is to avoid a hard fork then how does hard forking to lower difficulty prevent a hard fork?
@_date: 2016-06-11 03:30:00


You would need to pay that for 0.4 kB - 1 kB transactions (for example using multiple inputs). Not really cheap.
@_date: 2017-08-10 10:35:38
This is factually not true.
SegWit2x: 921 / 1000
If miners run btc1 codebase full node, then segwit2x hard fork is guaranteed in November.
@_date: 2016-06-26 11:22:25
Yes, I do realise that. Core team has done great job with compact blocks and segwit, other teams have done other on chain scaling improvements. Bitcoin is much better for it! To get the most of those technologies, higher capacity actually has to be enabled though.
Block propagation code before compact blocks was terribly inefficient, would be very good to get the numbers after the network is using compact blocks / xthin blocks. Picture should be much much better.
@_date: 2017-08-25 09:45:28
Bigger blocks would protect against malicious miners who do not include transactions by allowing good miners to include more transactions.
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:12:56
In a hypothetical future scenario where ECDSA is broken/weakened, if you haven't had exposed your public keys, your bitcoin would still be safe.

@_date: 2016-11-22 11:05:26
To use the extra capacity of SegWit wallets and services need upgrade their code. It will take much longer than two weeks.
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:14:41
In theory, a malicious miner could spam the blockchain for data storage or something like that. Though it has never happened yet in bitcoin or even litecoin (which has bigger blocks, cheaper tx fees), but the theoretical risk is there. Therefore some small blockers do not trust miners. Recently the accusation of covert ASICBOOST has even made trust matter much worse. Even more people do not want to give miners the power now.
@_date: 2016-11-24 22:50:19
We need these things ~~today~~ a year ago.
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:50:37
That is the beauty of hard forks: you get to make the decision yourself.
@_date: 2016-11-24 10:22:38


There's no way to know what the price would be if we had done a hard-fork to bigger blocks. I think it would be much higher.
@_date: 2016-11-22 09:18:02
You're forgetting the 3rd solution: hard forking to bigger block sizes.
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:50:04
Yes, this should doom the segwit1x chain if miners stay to NY agreement.
@_date: 2017-04-14 22:00:13


Segwit does not provide immediate transaction capacity increase. Only segwit transactions spending previous segwit outputs get the extra capacity. Please correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2017-04-06 09:36:56
Patents (state power) is the problem. No one else will be able to compete against the mining monopoly.
@_date: 2017-04-11 20:23:48
We need to hard fork + Segwit + ASICBoost fix + all the other goodies!
@_date: 2017-04-07 09:40:20
His recent blog post on ASICBoost:
@_date: 2017-04-14 10:20:59
Current 1MB limit = max 20M transactions per month
Segwit = max 40M transactions per month
8 MB hard fork = max 160M transactions per month
Lightning network might be the future flying car, but just increasing the block size is like adding extra lanes to a road. It's a smart thing to do today to allow more people to use bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-21 08:44:18
There's no need to choose between the two methods, we should be doing both: increasing the block limit AND on second layer solutions!
@_date: 2016-02-25 16:30:34

If you used GreenAddress, then it was 2-of-2 multisig input. Those were always bigger. Before segwit such transaction was 301 byte.
After segwit such transaction is 340 bytes (was 339 bytes [for me](
New segwit blocks can hold 4e6/700=5714 such transactions, before segwit 1e6/301=3322 GreenAddress transactions could fit into a block. There is 72% capacity increase.
Why are Segwit transactins 340 bytes vs old 301 bytes? Because of some data duplication how P2SH-Pw2SH does it.


@_date: 2017-09-07 16:39:03
Allow extra capacity for future adoption.
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:26:13
At the very end. But there was no burn, clearly the person was not bitter at all, he was very rational.
@_date: 2017-05-19 12:50:36
It would create some amount of confusion. Which fork is the real bitcoin? They're both real, that's how blockchain-based money works.
It takes time for people understand hard forks.
@_date: 2017-05-05 12:58:59
The situation is very shitty, I am sorry for your pain. Long-term solution is to increase on chain transaction capacity via a hard fork.
In the meantime, please try the following:

Again, the solution is to have 2 forks and you choose your fork and I choose my own. The worst possible solution is to have 2 different visions stuck on a single blockchain.
@_date: 2017-05-23 13:58:43
1. Bitcoin currenty units are limited in a similar way how letters are limited in the English language (only 26 letters). Anyone can create a new language and some languages are superior to English, but people still use English and not Esperanto.
2. Bitcoin and gold are not backed by anything. Backing requires trust in the central authority that does the backing, whole point of bitcoin is that we don't have to trust a central authority (you can't call anyone and demand that they give you a blowjob for your gold).
@_date: 2017-05-17 10:21:02
Game theory. Miners really really don't want to be orphaned. That's why emerging consensus on block size is safe.
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:16:47
Good question. Thanks!
My full node will never accept blocks that are too large to handle. I set the limit. With hard fork, users get to choose the fork.
The blockchain will never get too big with 8 MB limit.
@_date: 2017-05-19 19:23:49
I run a full node because I want bitcoin to succeed and it's very cheap to run a full node. There is enough motivation.

@_date: 2017-05-02 14:58:59

The 100-MB-blockers and the perma-1-MB-blockers BOTH scare the shit out of me. Why can't we just choose the sane solution that would work for everyone. Segwit2x would be nice. Let's hope it people jump on that.
@_date: 2017-05-05 12:34:15
Priority is $3.20 / kB.
Normal is $2.20 / kB.
Just not enough space on the blockchain for all transactions.

Upgrading is easy. My full node would accept those blocks.
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:58:20
We different forks and users choosing between those forks, that's best protection against any centralized government. The irrational fear of forks is what got us in this mess.
@_date: 2017-05-16 17:33:23


For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, this results in a fee of 67,800 satoshis.

The risk is that you don't get paid by an exchange.
@_date: 2017-05-19 08:25:16
A soft fork is supposed to be safe and non disrupting, no risk of splitting the chain.
By doing a user activated soft fork (full node enforced soft fork?) we introduce a chain split, so why even go soft fork? Wouldn't hard fork be a better and cleaner option?
Hard forks are not the evil that they are made to be by the fearmongerers. Best way to upgrade the protocol in this case is a hard fork.
All that being said we need to upgrade the protocol. Bitcoin will die if it cannot improve. I support forks!
@_date: 2017-07-18 15:55:20
More on chain capacity would allow more people in the world to use bitcoin (control their private keys directly). Segwit2x is superior to segwit1x.
@_date: 2017-07-18 14:56:34
With blockchain.info you manage your keys, it's your coins.
On an exchange you are not in control of the private keys, the bitcoin is not yours, it is theirs.
Bitcoin Core project will either merge changes from btc1 or they will remain on legacy segwit1x chain, or maybe segwit2x fails, or something else happens. Most likely everyone will switch to btc1 code for the transition period.

The economic majority would support a hardfork with 4-8 MB limit, malleability fix, asicboost fix, the new fancy opcodes, etc.
Why would the core dev team not propose this as they have the ability and the support?
This irrational fear of hardforks is madness, a hardfork would not cause any major problems.

If full nodes do nothing they cause a chain split. If full nodes upgrade to btc1 then no chain split occurs. The incentive is for full nodes to upgrade to avoid the split.
@_date: 2017-07-18 14:43:26
Just hold bitcoin in your control (a wallet that has your private keys, not on an exchange!) and relax.
You'll need to upgrade to  in 3 months to follow the majority chain.

Miners are signaling NYA on bit 4. If they are running btc1 codebase, then hard fork is guaranteed by code.
@_date: 2017-07-17 20:43:17
Only bit 4 matters if you run btc1 client. Makes sense to signal on bit 4 only, that adds extra incentive to upgrade the full node software to btc1.
@_date: 2017-07-18 14:45:12
Very good comment, thank you. This is indeed segwit2x signalling and it will eventually lock in hard fork.
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:16:32
In year 2014 1MB blocks took forever to propagate. But compact blocks have reduced peak bandwidth requirement 50 times. Yet small blockers still use the old data and keep screaming "centralization". It's just bullshit.
Big blockers want non financial information data to be stored on a decentralized network at no cost. That should never happen. It's crazy.
Both extreme ends are crazy and should be ostracized from the community. Segwit falls into this category, it's much too small already today. Segwit2x makes sense to me as hobbyist full node operator.
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:19:08
Biggest miner [has clearly stated]( they will hard fork to segwit2x:


[86% of hashpower is signaling segwit2x hard fork intent.](
The chance of segwit2x hard fork happening is almost 100% unless something dramatically changes.
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:46:52
There is disagreement how to scale bitcoin. Some propose segwit, some propose hard fork to bigger blocks, others suggest both. But it is very sad that no option is winning :( This has been a problem from 2013, the history is long and painful, silencing of opposing thought, insults, accusations, etc. People are in pain and that doesn't help.
@_date: 2017-07-17 12:20:47
100%. If segwit2x activates then hard fork in 3 months is guaranteed by code.

Majority is signalling bit 4 as in NYA agreement, which is segwit2x.
@_date: 2017-07-19 18:24:44
Miners and many users want increased on-chain capacity and segwit1x is just not enough.

History has proven that increasing the blocksize is extremely difficult, therefore it makes sense to have extra capacity in advance to allow people to use bitcoin in case of global financial collapse.

Most important part:


@_date: 2017-07-16 08:01:53
Depends what the miners do. If miners follow segwit2x, then segwit1x will not have enough hashrate to survive.
@_date: 2016-07-03 22:02:37
What does it mean no chance of being merged?
If the economic majority adopted a hardfork, then all bitcoin software projects would merge that hardfork (if they wanted to use the blockchain).
@_date: 2017-06-08 11:35:16
Historical archival nodes on cheap hard drives would be cheap. Only UTXO set needs fast access.
Segwit's discount for signatures making UTXO more expensive is really good. Segwit haters have that wrong.

Hard forks give the power to the holders. By making hard forks difficult, you are taking power away from the holders. No!

Hard forks are the way bitcoin evolves and adapts. Soft fork is tightening of the rules, hard fork is changing of the rules.
When bitcoin will be hard-forking often and easily, you will know that we have an adaptive and resistant system. Let's strive for that!

You don't lose decentralization or security with a conservative hardfork to 2MB. You lose security by making bitcoin too expensive to use. You gain security through adoption.

Core has always been "concerned" about scaling, but they never put focus to optimize it. Compact blocks reduced peak bandwidth by 10-50 times, but it was never a priority until Unlimited team did xthin first. Core then reacted very quickly to save face.

Always hold. In case of splits you will have money on all chains. Be sure to control your private keys, do not hold on exchanges.

Hard fork to double segwit 90*144 blocks after segwit. That has 80% hashing power support. That's the main message.

70 people are bidding to get a ride on 60 seat (on average) bus. The bidders don't know the future luck and blockrate, only average. We could only have 2 blocks in the next hour, thus making the bus only have 20 seats effectively. Need to pay extra to ensure you buy the seat in top 20 if you don't want to risk your tx getting stuck on bad luck.
@_date: 2017-06-22 12:00:35
Segwit2x should make small blockers happy as it keeps full nodes cheap to run.
Segwit2x should make moderate blockers happy because we get 4x capacity compared to today.
Both big blockers (20+ MB) and must-run-full-node-on-pi-via-tor blockers are not be happy, but both extreme ends are crazy.
No splits, community united once again. Anyone against segwit2x is really against bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-03 19:21:15
Segwit decreases signature cost, effectively increasing UTXO cost. UTXO is the main concern for long-term scaling, it's the precious resource.
This could be done with a hard-fork though...
@_date: 2017-06-19 06:46:17
Why would I buy altcoins if I think bitcoin will go up in value with segwit2x? Makes no sense.
If you think segwit2x will harm bitcoin, you should be buying altcoins, not me.
@_date: 2016-07-14 17:38:18
The market can, in the future, value some altcoin more than bitcoin. Bitcoin is not operating in vacuum, it's competing with altcoins.
High fees are subsidising altcoins and it's insane to introduce this risk early in bitcoin's life.
@_date: 2017-06-01 09:03:27
Who wants unlimited on-chain scaling? Do some tx capacity increase because it works, helps us NOW and keeps the system decentralized.
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:12:51
You are right, thank you. But my point is that miners can fake signal now and will implement the code changes before September (if they follow the agreement).
@_date: 2017-06-20 07:04:36
1 Gbit/s = 20 EUR/month. Unlimited. But I already had the internet before bitcoin, so node's bandwidth is free.

Why not sidechains? IMO, sidechains are much more promising than LN. Even if LN fails, we're not doomed.
Main chain scaling + sidechains could accommodate "coffees" for 7 billion people.
@_date: 2017-06-05 07:59:31
UASF BIP148 is better nothing, but segwit2x might actually have the broad support.
Miners could be against segwit because of covert asicboost, but I seriously doubt it. Simplest explanation is that segwit is just not enough and miners want more on-chain capacity and they want the devs to deliver it, miners don't want to lead. History (HK agreement, censorship, etc) supports this.

Ask not what bitcoin can do for you, but what you can do for bitcoin.
This is the strategy. Buy now, hold. After fork you will have money in all forks. Sell the fork you don't want, buy the fork you support. This is how we all win long-term.
@_date: 2017-06-19 05:35:39
Segwit2x seems to be the best and most realistic option. Miners activate segwit and hard fork to double capacity. In total tx capacity is increased ~4x. 4x keeps blockchain bloat small and full nodes cheap. It gives us 2 more years of steady adoption growth and time to develop 2nd layer solutions.
@_date: 2017-06-22 12:09:53
There's no difficulty executing a hard fork that has 90% hashpower support. The problem is that Core dev team has decided to not even try hard forks.
@_date: 2017-07-19 17:42:02


Yes, this is why hard forks are better than soft forks. In case of hard fork, users get full choice which chain to follow.

Make sure you control the private keys, don't hold bitcoin on exchanges. Withdraw to your wallet before any hard forks.

I completely agree that miners have failed us. What to do? UASF BIP148 still needs at least 20% hashrate, better more.
The devs wanted a fee market and rejected HF solutions, I don't see how it's an attack on them. It's factually true.

This is the bitcoin today. Many people predicted this problem in 2014, but core devs didn't listen.
@_date: 2017-06-01 09:36:09
Hard fork is a good way to upgrade the protocol. We need more tx capacity yesterday and Segwit is not enough.
@_date: 2017-06-07 12:00:25


Wrong. 1 satoshi/byte = 0.00000001 BTC / byte = 0.00001 BTC / kB = 0.01 mBTC / kB.
100 sat/byte = 1 mBTC/kB = 0.001 BTC/kB. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:57:00


The devs absolutely failed to listen to the miners.
I agree that segwit is better than nothing, but there shouldn't be any surprise why the miners wouldn't support it. Devs never gave a shit what miners wanted.
@_date: 2017-06-23 13:33:08
Users want reliable transactions that are not super expensive.
Miners support segwit2x.
I don't see miners being at odds with the users.

@_date: 2016-07-14 17:32:32
Bitcoin has not yet become the best (most wanted) money in the world. High tx fees are stunting adoption and makes it possible that bitcoin will lose to an altcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-08 11:21:01
Businesses seem to not care enough to fight for bitcoin, they will just dump the fees on users and adopt shitcoins :(
@_date: 2017-06-20 08:59:41
What you're saying is very likely, but it's not important.
The agreement states that we get segwit2x hard fork to double capacity in September-October. If miners stick to the agreement (why wouldn't they?), then hard fork will happen with 80% hashrate, the legacy chain will not have enough hashpower to survive.
@_date: 2017-07-18 07:47:16
If 2x is the fork with majority hashpower (&gt;80%) it will be stupid to remain on the legacy 1x chain.
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:09:12
Or to add more seats to the bus, or add flying car technology on top. Best both!

This would be good (proved to work well for litecoin), but will have to wait other future hard forks. Not enough support for it now.

Not enough on-chain capacity on the bitcoin network.
@_date: 2017-06-05 07:32:46
This is typical if you receive lots of small transactions and then try to spend them. The fee depends on the transaction size and transaction size depends on the number of inputs.

Miners don't trust the core devs.

Bitcoin is fighting a tough fight against other forms of money and victory is not certain. Having bitcoin artificially crippled is too dangerous.
Adoption is not the only goal, but without adoption all other goals fail.

Segwit2x increases capacity four times and keeps full nodes cheap to run. Seems like a no-brainer.
@_date: 2017-06-05 07:28:40
I'm sorry, you are fucked. You received many small transactions so now to collect all of them creates a big transaction, which requires a high fee :(
Best thing you can do now is to send the transaction to yourself with a minimum mycellium fee and wait days (weeks?) for it to confirm. That will aggregate your 10 inputs into 1. EDIT: mycellium lowest fee is still pretty high, so this is not an option
We need to increase the transaction capacity on the bitcoin network. Currently it's much much too small.
@_date: 2017-06-07 11:57:00


That's 4.4 mBTC/kB or 0.0044 BTC/kB. Holy cats, that is $12/kB... We need more transaction capacity yesterday!
@_date: 2017-06-09 10:44:52
Withdraw from all exchanges before August 1st. Control your private keys. If you just hold, you will have money on all future chains.
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:09:52


Why do they not support segwit? In 2016 miners said they wanted Segwit+2MB hard fork, in 2017 miners say they want Segwit+2MB hard fork. Damn those mysterious miners!! What do they want?? Impossible to know!
@_date: 2017-06-08 08:11:03
In my opinion fee for transaction should be higher than cost for full nodes to store that transaction.
10000 (number of full nodes I would like to see) * RAM cost per kB (assuming worst case UTXO storage). This arrives at $0.08 per kB. I would like fees to be around that. It would be a problem if fees were lower than $0.08/kB.
@_date: 2017-06-20 06:46:07
Why reckless? There's no damage from 2x hard fork. Bandwidth, memory, SSDs are all cheap.
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:39:51
Wait a minute. Since around 2014 the fear was that miners would charge too small fees and bloat the blockchain. Now miners are charging too high fees? Which is it? Is it possible some influential devs were wrong while others (now removed from Core project) [were right](
[Majority hashrate wanted more on-chain capacity 15 months ago]( above what segwit would provide. You can't deny that.
@_date: 2017-06-05 07:18:37
Upgrade your mycellium wallet app. Before sending the transaction it shows the number of inputs, number of outputs and transaction size. What's your transaction size?
@_date: 2017-06-09 10:43:21
False dichotomy. We need both on-chain scaling and layer 2 scaling. Bigger blocks and lightning network are all complementary.
@_date: 2017-06-20 11:15:28
Everyone now has the privilege of paying high transaction fees :(
@_date: 2017-06-20 07:50:46
Centralizing effects of what? Only hashpower centralization matters. Miners can afford fast connection. Compact blocks lowers peak bandwidth requirement 10-50 times. This is not 2013.
@_date: 2016-07-01 14:19:44
High fees are starting to hurt bitcoin adoption. Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency, it is competing against altcoins, which are happy to take in all those cheap users.
