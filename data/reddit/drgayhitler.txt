The ability to edit metadata on currency transaction is not a "quirk" and certainly is an issue with the protocol.

I mean, at this point you just have the word that exchanges have fixed the problem, with little oversight into whether they have or not. The only thing that I would (cautiously) accept is if the protocol itself is fixed.  If I use a product, I expect a certain amount of quality.  If a product has a fundamental security flaw, I expect that flaw to be fixed.  It IS their problem if it is the user's problem, with an issue as important as security in a currency transaction protocol.

I didn't say OSS was a business model, I said expecting users to fix your mistakes is not a good business model, whether you use an open or closed source development model.
If the users contribute to the foundation, sure.  And yet, that foundation, or development group, is itself responsible for bug catching and fixing.  If I own an exchange, and I contribute money to this project, I expect the members of the project to release a quality protocol, and I shouldn't have to rely on work-arounds as a permanent fix.  
If you release software, and I am a user, and it has a fundamental flaw, can you honestly expect the user to be the one to figure out a fix for it.  Do you think it is a good strategy for anyone, say Red Hat or Microsoft or even Canonical, to say "we recognize a security flaw, we are helping users patch the problem, but we correcting the bug is not required at this time.  We may address it in a future version."

Man, good thing the market is regulated and bitcoins are traceable so people might have a chance to get their money back.

So you are saying that if a protocol for transferring currency had a fundamental security flaw, you should shut up and accept it or pay for it yourself because the responsibility of addressing the issue is on you, not those who made the mistake?  Is that what you are saying?  I'm not talking about an obscure hardware implementation bug or something, I'm talking about a serious security issue.  You are saying that it is the user's responsibility, not the developers?

I think my point is being missed. I was simply attempting to point out the problem in being glad that this has happened, when the way that it has happened has likely ruined quite a few lives. Whether they be deserving of it or not doesn't mean that their families are.  Perhaps it would be better to take the high road via the "I told you so" route and still acknowledge that the way Mt.Gox's tenure in Bitcoin history will end is in a very tragic, negative way. 
It would have been much better for Bitcoin's reputation if this exchange was pressured to close down after allowing withdraws by the community for it's questionable and apparently incompetent management of it's security. At this point it isn't clear if anyone will be able to get their BTC if Mt. Gox goes completely under.
Full disclosure, I am not at all a proponent of Bitcoin at this time.

Yeah, if 3% of the coins in circulation were stolen we need to move on...
...or shouldn't we address the myriad of problems that can cause this issue and fix them so they don't happen again?
Hopefully that is what you mean by "move on?"
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:34:58
Yeah, bitcoin has never been used to buy cocaine, you are right.
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:45:20
Disclosure being necessary as I am not attempting to troll. :) 
@_date: 2014-02-26 09:12:02
Yeah, it's such a great thing that thousands of people lost all of their savings buying into the hype, or worse.

If you are a developer, I don't think expecting users (exchanges, in this case) to fix your software issues is a good business model in either closed or open-source.  
I see very robust bug catching and fixing in many open source projects, from paid and volunteer developers.
If you are selling a product, you should be the one to fix it, not those who buy into it.
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:00:03
So why even use Bitcoin then?
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:52:10
The "bug" in the protocol that caused this mess.  Shouldn't there be a more active developer role in fixing this issue instead of having the exchanges compensate for it?
"Bitcoin developers are collaborating with known affected exchanges to fix their internal systems and help resuming withdrawals as soon as possible. Some pool operators have been reported to work on blocking duplicate transactions to help mitigate the problem. Emergency fixes to the Bitcoin protocol are not required and future improvements are already being discussed."
