Steady currency should be the goal. $500 for a new bed should buy that same $500 bed 3 years later. Ideally Btc will hit a peak and become stable after that.

Well hopefully no IRS agents are browsing this page looking for people to go after.

Are there more forks coming?

I hear we have Bitcoinx and Super Bitcoin now too

1.2% a year? Not sure where you bank but most savings accounts I have found won't break the 1% level. I agree that it wouldn't be so bad just for an emergency fund

It was actually not calculated correctly. Due to inflation the dollar loses 3% of its value every year. 3% of $10,000 is $300. So in 1 year that same $10,000 only buys what $9,700 would have bought today.

Your right. You are 100% secure and guaranteed that you will lose money by putting it into a savings account. I hear negative interest rate bonds are pretty safe as well.
My point is if losing money slowly is the best alternative, why not invest into something.

It's because Bitcoin is still very undervalued.  When we see a $100,000 Bitcoin and it is widely accepted it is likely that it will go up very slow.  Maybe 3%/yr or so at that point. Then it will be more user friendly as a currency.

I wouldn't give Trump any ideas that involve him making money at others expense. He just might do it.

Nobody knows when it will pull back.  But most likely it will keep going up until at least November 16th.  It may drop temporarily after that.  But that is just my best guess.

I agree, some people may claim that it is hard for people who aren't tech savy.... But in this day and age you almost have to be tech savy to survive anyways.  Practically every "Career" requires you to be able to learn new computer programs and software. Why is Bitcoin any different.

What was the best time after that?

Whenever I hear someone say a few Bitcoin wallets hold most of the Bitcoin I think about how uneven the dollar is distribute.
