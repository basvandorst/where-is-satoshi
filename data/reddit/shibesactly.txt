Thanks for this thread. My question: what protects bitcoin, or any cryptocurrency, from corruption via undue influence exerted against its developers? Coercion, blackmail, bribery, etc.

Did not realize that the CEO of MtGox is a Bitcoin Foundation board member:  . Quite disturbing.

What about something that's not so much the evil-hacker-finger-over-a-button crap like what we see in mainstream media articles about bitcoin, but a more subtle influence, like what occurs frequently in Wikipedia? It seems like bitcoin has a lot of enemies in the established financial world. If I were a powerful old-world financial entity with an anti-bitcoin agenda, I would be looking to pack the dev team with ringers. Historically, has there been any drama stemming from perceived conflicts of interest among bitcoin devs?

Great job guys!!
Small crowd, but mighty. Your protester-to-press-coverage ratio is outstanding.

I got my 5.8 BTC stuck transaction refunded back to my account today (was stuck since Jan 21st), and immediately tried to withdraw again. I tried 5 transactions total: 2 for 1.0 BTC each, and 3 for 0.1 BTC each (total 2.3 BTC). One of the 0.1 BTC transactions went through instantly; the other four appear stuck.

I was waiting over two weeks on a BTC withdrawal. They finally "refunded" it into my account. I tried to withdraw it again, and it got stuck again.

Can confirm, am idiot.

So the majority of users would have to understand that the change is nefarious, and they would have to fork it into a whole new cryptocurrency?

Thanks for posting these bylaws. Looks like the revocation might be able to happen for "cause", but yes, not arbitrarily.

Similar situation here. Waiting 4 days for a BTC withdrawal. Account was debited, but nothing on the blockchain. No reply from Mt. Gox support.

I've been waiting 6 days for a BTC withdrawal from mtgox to come through. My account was debited, but nothing hit the blockchain. 5 days with no reply to a support ticket.

This should be carved on Gox's tombstone.

Thanks for the details. The centralized trust is a bit scary, because I would think that, as the bitcoin userbase and infrastructure increases, the likelihood of a viable fork decreases, while the incentive to influence the administrators increases.
@_date: 2014-02-04 09:27:53
OK, thanks. So I'm assuming that the less developed cryptos would be more susceptible to influence, because there are fewer developers and ultimately less oversight.
For changes to Bitcoin Core, how is consensus determined? Majority vote? Small set of users with administrative powers?
@_date: 2014-02-05 02:00:04
Possible, but not consistent with the fact that many users have had some transactions get stuck, while others go through instantly.

Wow, that was fascinating, thanks. Clear example of a situation where gun-to-the-head is a reasonable explanation, and an opportunity to see some open source safety valves functioning smoothly. The McCarthyistic undertones of **red**listing specific bitcoins are deeply ironic. While I do think someone may easily build a blacklisting layer over the top of bitcoin, it's good to see such resistance to incorporating it into the core source.

Yay! [Video in WSJ]( = win! Great work!
I loved the "I'm not touching you" part :)
