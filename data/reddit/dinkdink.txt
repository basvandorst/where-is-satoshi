Huh? Your argument is 8 megabyte blocks aren't a problem because bcash blocks have a maxblocksize of 8 mbs.  The two are not the same:  Bcash for most of its short-lived history has been propagating ~100kB blocks (because no one has been using it).  Source:   Only recently has bcash's blocksize gone above Bitcoin's post-segwit size.
There are many other blockchain engineering issues besides block propagation.  Bcash doesn't segregate it's witness data and therefor SigOP attacks are possible (poison blocks etc)

It would be inadvisable for an exchange to allow collateral, that isn't the security that's being shorted, to be used.  If the prices increases dramatically, a short's position will need to be closed.  If a short trader only has USD balance as collateral, there's no guarantee that the exchange can liquidate the USD holdings into as much BTC as is owed to the lender.

What evidence do you have of that.  The only evidence we have is that the coins were moved all to one address.  Zero evidence that the US marshals sold it to the highest bidder
Edit for all the downvoters: you need a lesson in epistemology and government corruption.   When you have a closed auction where bids are not public disclosed, you have 0 evidence as to
A.) the spread amount that the bids came in at.
B.) What amount the awarded bid was at.
Governments (especially Russia) have a long history of having closed door auctions that the government holds allows people to bid, that don't follow ethical guidelines, and awards it to someone who's in the pocket of the government.  Until you have evidence of A and B you have 0 proof that the bitcoins were awarded to the highest bidder.

Why are users down voting every comment that states that hard forks are a cataclysmic mess without providing a rebuttal?
Hard forks are an absolute nightmare if you're a payment processor, exchange, miner because you could effectively choose a chain that doesn't win and all the transactions you accepted and delivered services/goods for, that aren't on the winning blockchain, will be lost.  This is *not* a technical paradigm that is attractive for large-scale institution and won't drive adoption. Imagine pitching the two solutions to a company CTO,
 "Option A is we gamble losing our entire business revenue for 2 months while we wait for a chain to succeed. 
Option B we have our engineering team spend a two weeks implement blockchain extensions.
Option A: If you're a million dollar/day revenue company, you're gambling $60,000,000
Option B: you sinking roughly $100,000 dollars in labor costs to guarantee your business revenue. (Unless you can be 99.8% certain that your chain will win, it's better to go with Option B)
From a business operations perspective the choice is clear. 
My suspicion is that most reddit users are no to low volume.  Insofar that the users don't need to move coins during the hardfork-settlement period, it really doesn't matter to them if there's a blockchain schism.  Further more if you don't need to move coins during the period, it's actually advantageous, from a game-theory perspective, to vote for a hardfork blocksize increase.  You have zero assets are risk and you might get a new feature that you don't have to pay for O(n) scaled transaction size.  This effectively exports all of the risk to businesses who are using Bitcoin.

The obligation of the exchange is to return the lent funds to the lender.  If the USD collateral is an amount that's insufficient to repurchase the lent amount, the exchange cannot meet that obligation.  
    Example:
    
    You have $10k USD in collateral
    You borrow 1 BTC
    Best Bid price is $10k/BTC, Best Ask price is $11k/BTC
    You market sell your borrowed 1 BTC (The short opens here)
    You now have $20k USD ($10k collateral, $10k from the short)
    A single market buy order comes into the market and removes all 
    liquidity from $11k/BTC to $21k/BTC
    The Best Ask price is now $21k/BTC
    Exchanges liquidates you by forcing you to market buy at $21k/BTC (short closes here)
    You now have ~.95 BTC
    You do not have enough funds to return 1 BTC to your lender

A limit order is adding liquidity to the book.  When you get liquidated you are removing liquidity from the book.

That being said I don't think most miners operate this way (Why I don't know).  I also don't mine so there may be some nuances that I'm missing and would be interested to hear from miners to hear their viewpoint on this theory.

The difference in an asset that's seen a 1000% rise ex-post and *promising* 3600% gains is that when promising you are setting your future obligations.
The reason I think most people see bitcoin as a Ponzi scheme is because most feel it's a [Greater Fool]( ploy.  I'm guessing that they think the only reason people are buying it is because the speculators expect someone else to buy it later at a higher price.  This is contrasted by the fact that many people buy bitcoin because it's a superior value transfer mechanism.

Depending on if you are classically liberal or classically conservative, only someone who is classically liberal (as in you allow the will of the people, which is more libertarian) would actually support bitcoin.  It's a monetary system that  subverts power and control.  You no longer have to have the state tell you who the authorized bankers ( inherently an old boy, those in power, the rich get richer group).
If you're interested in social justice ( which I think many progressives are ) you can make the case for tons of social justice cases for bitcoin. Case in point: women many middle Eastern countries aren't even allowed to open a bank account that's not tied to their husband. Bitcoin gives them the power to but their own money/labor into their power. The problem being is that the state is being the bad guy in this case and forbade women opening a bank account by themselves.

What would you say to the counterpoint that the problem with the state policing theft is that that charter eventually encroaches on the people's ability for free speech. That is Hollywood has lobbied congress etc to criminalize certain types of speech through the DMCA. Or that they should be able to blacklist someone from having internet access because they are a file sharer?  If you say the state can protect against theft you'd eventually say that in order to do that they have to control speech / the internet.
What would you say to the counter point that in the state's attempt to prevent aggression ( what they debatably call terrorism ) the solution the state has generated is the largest warrentless spying program in the world? Is that an acceptable solution?
What would say to the counterpoint that typically acts of preventing aggression are inherently racist? Case in point the LA riots where police only protected white neighborhoods and not neighborhoods of color?  Or that in prosecuting aggressors people of color and poorer people are sent to jail at alarmingly higher rates than white people.

This is grossly incorrect.  If you're unfamiliar with statistics, please check with someone who is before making comments.
P(f) = probability of a single key failing (loss, corruption, sabotage, etc)
M = the number of keys required for the quarum
N = the total number of keys in the multi sig address
The probability of a multisig address, of M of N keys required to write the correct output, failing is = P(f)^(n-m+1)
so for the sake of argument, a regular key fails with 30%.  in a mutlisig address of 2 of 3, it fails at .3^(3-2+1)=.09

1.) Attacker communicates a transaction (T) from A wallet to B wallet on the network.
2.) Honest miners include T in their records.
3.) Owner of wallet B releases goods or services to attacker
4.) Attacker then communicates another transaction T_ds (double spend) from A wallet to C wallet.
5.) Attacker (who controls 51% of hashpool) includes T_ds in their records/blockchain.
6.) Attacker starts mining blocks with T_ds, ignoring T.
7.) Since they have a dominant share of the hashpool they will eventually build a larger proof of work associated with the blockchain fork that includes T_ds.

If I understand your payment implementation (which I may not):
Customer sends BTC from customer address A to pump address X
Pump authorizes fluid dispensing amount up until BTC/(BTC/volume)
After transaction is complete, Pump address X sends change to customer address B.
As I understand it, with micro-transaction channels:
Address A and Address X open up a channel between the two of them (off block chain) with some upper bound to the total maximum transaction they'll allow.  As address A consumes more of the good that's being handled by the transaction (milliliters of fluid, minutes of wifi, kWh of energy, therms of gas) they continue to sign authorizing funds over to wallet X.  At the end of the transaction, only one transaction (and fees) go out over the network, reducing blockchain bloat, unnecessary miner fees etc.
I think of it like they reserve a block of bitcoin of size B with increments of size 1/T.  I sign up for a wifi service in a hotel, they charge .001 BTC per hour. I open a MTchannel, we set aside, B=.005 BTC T=48 (every 30 minutes).  I sign a transaction to the hotel for the first 30 minutes, use it up.  Sign another tx for 30 minutes use it up.  I try to pull a fast one, don't sign a third tx.  Hotel disables my wifi account.  Has signed transaction details for the first two hours.  hotel can now initiate at .001BTC payment to their address.

If a client is constantly bouncing checks, the overhead dealing with those issues (because of how the banking network is setup, at least in the US) isn't worth the small acquired capital to banks.
That's why bad credit applicants are denied accounts.

I've been reading through the comments and one of the weaknesses of your argument is that you're saying that it takes 20 years to pay for a home ( with all economic factors incorporated into that loan, no one gives out free lunches, do they?) and that in an entirely deflationary world, it would also take 20 years, which is a big supposition.
If a programmed inflation currency exists ( which is what bitcoin really is ) with overall deflationary trends, than if one is to convince a rational actor ( supposition) to hand over their gold/ bitcoin today to own a piece of property which will be worth a lower amount of gold or bitcoin in the future. It's going to have to be at a discount.
I think doing some loan amortization with inflation factored in should open up some sights to what such a system would look like in a deflationary would.

In an inflationary world, people in the housing market have to say. I need to buy this today or else it's going to be x% more expensive in the future.  And are give up future productivity so they may have the item now
It works the same way in a deflationary world. The buyer says I'd rather hang on to my rare monetary transaction tool as it'll be worth more in the future. So they negotiate and the buyer gives up future productivity by handing something over that equates to future productivity. It's just a mirror version, both dealing with future productivity.

@_date: 2017-02-03 12:51:11
Many comments here that don't address the fundamental blockchain engineering issues, the main one for block time interval being orphan rate. Others being storage and bandwidth constraints.
If it takes 30 seconds* for a block to reach a high percentile of miners (say 95%) for 100% of blocks (meaning orphan rate symmetry which is not the case real world) miners can expect a 5% orphan rate (30 seconds / 10 minutes). If you decrease the block interval to 1 minute, the orphan rate will sky rocket to 50% and favor those miners who have orphan rate asymmetry (which promotes geographical and judicial consolidation). There's also other factors to consider like transaction validation timing and other issues.
* Edit: I'm not certain what the current propagation durations are.

Things you need to trust when you have a paper wallet.
- Paper-wallet generating code.
- The machine that you used to run the paper-wallet generating code isn't compromised.
- That the private key got cleared out of your RAM
- That the printer you used does store past prints (many office printers do) in a cache
- That the ink won't fade
- That the machine that you import your private key to hasn't been compromised.
If you trust the machine that you're generating and importing private keys to/from hasn't been compromised, why not just keep the keys on that machine?
Things you need to trust to run a hardware wallet:
- Wallet generating code (doesn't have some weakened entropy inputs)
- Device is robust against ongoing side-channel attacks
- Wallet only exchanges signed transactions and destination addresses.
- Wallet accurately &amp; precisely displays the destination address of the transaction you're about
IMO the hardware wallet is more robust

Your statement is true but their are rate limits inherent in credit card networks.  I.e. A credit card company will terminate its contract with you if you issue charge backs repeatedly.  At the base level of the bitcoin protocol, there's nothing preventing you from attempting to double spend every transaction.  There have been proposals for nodes to reject double spend attempts that don't have a valid replace by fee flag.
This problem is solved by Lightning though as you cannot double spend in a payment channel.

Prices are set by the net demand of buyers and sellers.  While buying demand and relinquished/capitulated supply is capricious, the newly-issued supply is unwavering.  If the market reaches equilibrium at a ratio of "for every unit of issued-supply there's 31 units of flow" reducing the issued supply creates an imbalance -&gt; 31/30.5

If you honestly think the child should push their finger on the stove n=100 times to figure out if it's the stove that's hurting their finger you're missing the forest for the trees.  The dynamics of the stove burning the finger are so dominant that, while it may be true that the fat content, skin moisture, contact angle, may change the relative degree of the effect, it's very safe to assume the magnitude will be approximately the same.  In other words, if you think the skin charring is a state transition that could occur by chance without the stove and *just happened* to occur at the same time, you're deluded.

At minimum two - A money is a medium to communicate/transport value through space and time.  If no one desires your money, it's not a medium to communicate/transport value through space and time.  The more people who use a particular medium increases its salability.  A single person can drive up the lowest replacement cost of bitcoin but two people are needed to turn it into a medium.  If there's at least two people out there willing to allocate some amount of products/services/other-softer-monies for bitcoin, it creates the inevitable dynamic of a perpetuating increase in replacement cost 


If you think products/services rendered in the past have higher value than products/services rendered today, this is preferable.

ELI5: How do we enable more privacy, reduce node operation costs, and increase functionality of bitcoin smart contracts ("spendability predicates")?. Battle tested methods of cryptography are used to mask or pin data into traditional bitcoin cryptography which enable owners of coins to guarantee their terms for spending have been met without requiring all nodes to verify all the steps before the terms are met. Blocks are the digital courts with which Bitcoin nodes/users settle agreements. The ideal scenario would be to create courts that only needed receipts or "shadows" of the contracts that that were being presented. A court that required you to preform all steps to verify the contract will never be scalable (read: ethereum). Schnorr + Taproot + Graftroot are changes that enable users more private contracts, with more features, all while reducing the amount of computation the "digital courts" deal with.

The bitcoin whitepaper showed that a centralized, trusted-third-party, double-spend oracle could be replaced with a market of decentralized (in the Distributed Systems sense) timestamping sellers (miners) if clients were willing to tolerate gradual, non Boolean, "probabilistic" finality.
The Sidechain's paper does a good job of elaborating on timestamping sellers (they call DMMS)




To address OP's sisters points:


There is no open/competitive market for a bank customer to interact with the assets custodied.  Modern banking agreements mean you're a creditor.  Bitcoin is liquid and the market to recustody funds is open/competitive (miners who forgo revenue eventually go out of business), and funds can be recustodied without requiring ongoing mining activity (lightning).
There's much marketing and hype around using a specific Distributed Systems term "decentralized" protocol.  It's better to analyze the difference between legacy banking and bitcoin through the lens of 'trust minimization'

The reason why Bitcoin will cause the mother of all bank runs is because Bitcoin will eat up banks' liquidity that is desperately needed to keep the leverage ratios in check.  Rather simply, because banks take in deposits and then generate revenue, by extracting the value of your capital, by lending it out to other people at interest.  This is the most common form of money creation in the economy (with other people focusing on T Bills, quantitative easing, etc) 
 If people continue to dump dollars/fiat (which are only liquid if your bank doesn't screw up and over leverage themselves) for money that is always liquid (Bitcoin) then essentially the liquidity that banks rely on dries up, their leveraging goes up, and the slightest market hiccup causes an intra/inter-bank  liquidity-failure cascade. [2]
Given that typical leverage ratios are ~3-5%[1] (or banks only have 1 dollar for ever 33 dollars they say they have) and that the total supply of M1 is ~4 Trillion [3], the balance they have available (5%*2e12=$200 billion) is hitting the first threshold of concern because Bitcoin's market cap is ~$150 billion and cryptocurrencies in total are $360 Billion[4] (though volume would be a better indication of flows).  No wonder central banks are literally conspiring to smear Bitcoin[5] rather than admit their own incompetence.  Once the Bitcoin/cryptocurrency market caps approach ~$800 billion (equivalent liquidity of M2 leverage) the sparks are really going to fly in liquidity problems with banks.
Will banks avoid this?  My guess is no, because such a CBDC won't allow the squish that banks need to cook books or mask liquidity problems as "Crises of confidence" and the competitive forces demand higher and higher amounts of leverage and that the government has colluded with the banking industry to constantly socialize their losses, while the banking sector privatizes gains.  For more reading check out, The End of Alchemy [7]
Which do you think is more likely Bitcoin is going to stop working or banks will under-engineer their financial safety factors and fail (like they've habitually done)?  Hopefully you have your skin in the game your gut tells you is going to happen.

Glad to hear.  Under a capitalist system, I think such a strategy would end up selecting only the competent banks to survive the inevitable stress tests.  The problem though is that the banking sector, in its entirety, isn't capitalist: Gains are privatized and losses are socialized (for the over leveraged banks). 
What I would be concerned about is the same competitive forces at play during the 2007-2009 financial crisis.  That is, the overwhelming market motivation to leverage more and more because profits are directly correlated to the leverage. Properly hedged banks lose equity and talent because over-leveraged banks can pay more because their present value doesn't incorporate their future costs.  As a result their either close up shop because their not profitable or lose market share and banks that are too big to fail become even bigger and even more of need of a bailout.

Because paying with a LN payment is not the same thing as paying with a credit/debit card.  A LN payment is irrevocable and instantaneous, payment cards take 30-90 days to settle.

@_date: 2017-10-26 22:40:58
Incorrect, before miners can start hashing block headers they must construct the merkle tree for transactions.  The more transaction that occur in a block increases that time which increases orphan rate.  This is why linear vs quadratic transaction verification scaling is very important.
If it takes a miner 6 seconds to construct the merkle root over a miner not constructing a complicated merkle root, they get a .5-1% increase in hashing power.

The objective of SSSS is to distribute a secret while maintaining the confidentiality of the secret among the shard holders.  Your method of segmenting the secret info chunks, confidentiality of the secret is not maintained.  If a bitcoin key was segmented the search space to reveal the key is vastly *vastly* reduced.  SSSS is easy to do wrong, easy to do you-think-right-but-actually-wrong, and hard to do right.  Some 'bitcoin educators' have irresponsibility recommended secret segmentation without disclosing the trade offs, maybe due to a lack of awareness.
Take the example below, naive secret segmentation would have revealed where the Christmas presents are.  But because the secret is sharded into confidential chunks, no message content leaks.

Trezor's web servers currently use Bitpay to become aware of what the market price for bitcoin is.  Say for instance you tell Trezor's webserver you'd like to send "$100 to party Alice".  Trezor needs to determine how many bitcoin is equivalent to $100.
BTC_to_send = User_USD_Payment_amount / USD_per_BTC
Stick is saying that Trezor cannot rely on Bitpay to reliably produce this information because of Bitpay's attitude towards the S2X fork.  E.g. it could be the case that Bitpay returns the USDS2X after the fork.  If S2X is trading at $600 per coin and BTC is trading at $6000 per coin, that would cause a user to send 10X as many coins to their recipient than intended.

E.g. If the NSA is using signal intelligence to log where all bitcoin transaction are occurring from they can start to associate certain transaction with certain regions and gain information, destroying privacy.
Abstract example: If you sell some milk for a dollar bill but the dollar bill has a bee pollen on it, it's more likely that the dollar bill came from a bee keeper.  Tor in this situation removes the bee pollen from the dollar bill.

Awesome work, I was seeding this idea, of incenting CoinJoin participation with fees as a solution to interest, out in the SF-Bitcoin-Dev scene when CoinJoin implementations were first starting to come out.  Awesome to see the idea has an implementation.

Unfortunately no.  Tor integration just severs the ip &lt;=&gt; physical location link when broadcasting transaction.  The ownership history is still present on the blockchain.  If you receive a transaction from a known Coinbase address and then spend it at Purse, Purse knows that you are likely a Coinbase customer.  MimbleWimble, Confidential Transaction, TumbleBit are working to solve these privacy deficiencies

Even if all market participants have already factored it in (assumes universal market knowledge), a new market equilibrium will result.
The thesis: "Halvenings don't affect prices" is equivalent to "Supply changes don't affect market prices".

That assumes you're economically rational.  If you want to DoS the network you and there isn't a limit on blocksize, you can release a poisson block that puts everyone else at a disadvantage trying to verify it.

ELI5: How do we enable more privacy, reduce node operation costs, and increase functionality of bitcoin smart contracts ("spendability predicates")?.  Battle tested methods of cryptography are used to mask or pin data into traditional bitcoin cryptography which enable owners of coins to guarantee their terms for spending have been met without requiring all nodes to verify all the steps before the terms are met.  Blocks are the digital courts with which Bitcoin nodes/users settle agreements.  The ideal scenario would be to create courts that only needed receipts or "shadows" of the contracts that that were being presented.  A court that required you to preform all steps to verify the contract will never be scalable (read: ethereum).  Schnorr + Taproot + Graftroot are changes that enable users more private contracts, with more features, all while reducing the amount of computation the "digital courts" deal with.  
These are some digestible presentations about the issues at hand:

Notice my argue isn't "The price will go to Y" just that *some* new equilibrium will result.  That is to say, there's no predicting market participants behavior, all you can predict is equilibriums at future capital flows.  "If it rains X cms, this is how high the dam will fill up" not "the dam will fill up this much because it will rain"
Bitcoin needs half as much capital flows every 210 000 blocks to sustain the same price levels (over the long run)
If the ratio of hodlers after the halvening is less than 1/2 of the current capital flows then yes, (over the long run) price levels can be down over the halvening.

The assertion that "bit coin mining computer suppliers must be scams because selling a machine that prints money is foolish" is weak and has some argument holes:
*First this assumes that the company has all the captial to buy the hardware needed for the machines.
*That there aren't overhead costs and logistic issues with running massive mining farms, who's going to maintain the cooling needs, who's going to ensure that the machines are remaining optimized. 
*It also discounts that the company selling the mining machine may be hedging their bets because they think the value of bitcoins will fall relatively soon.
*Maybe they think that their time is more valuable than the profit / true sunk time into a bitcoin miner ( where it might be economically feasible for someone else to get into it)
There are many reason why a company would get into the business of selling mining computer. You could extend your argument to say " why would a landlord ever sell his property if she can sit back and collect rent checks"
