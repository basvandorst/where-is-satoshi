Hi Someone please help me with my energy calculation. I wanna buy the S9 Antminer. It says it consumes 0.098 W/Gh and the capacity is 13.5 Th/s. I thought then the consumption is 98 W/Th and therefore 1323W/13.5TH. Watt is J/s and therefore it should consume 1323 W/s. So 1.323 kW/s, which would mean 114307KW/day. Assuming price of eletricity= 0.05cent/khw i would pay 5715 euros/day???? I know i miscalculated something, but i don't know what. If someone could please clear thing up. Thanks

i see haha thanks dude. one more question. the voltage is determined by what? the antminer, the power bank or the voltage in the outlet? it says the power plant that i have is 110 V. can i use it than for my antminer? what if it would have 240V? and why can i charge longer if the voltage is higher?

Ok makes sense: 
What about this one? 
If it has 500Wh, then i can charge my antminer, which consumes 1.323 kW with it? And for how long could i charge it? sorry it still doesnt make sense :)
