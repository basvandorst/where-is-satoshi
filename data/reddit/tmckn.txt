Bitcoin required exposure to fairly esoteric ideas, like Reusable Proof of Work (RPOW), and a rock-solid understanding of some more conventional ones (like Merkle Trees).
That makes it an idea that not a lot of people in this world could have come up with.
In addition, "re-inventing money" wasn't very high up on the list of ideas worth pursuing for computer scientists with familiarity with the aforementioned skills. That narrows the set to people with a deep interest in politics, economics and law.
This is why it's hard to believe that Satoshi is anyone but Nick Szabo.

You're forgetting that the CEO of Xapo is sitting on the board of directors of PayPal.
In addition, the original author of bcoin ( (a complete JavaScript-based bitcoin client, node and miner) Fedor Indutny, is a software engineer at PayPal.
The future seems clear to me. Buy and hodl.

What's happened to Bitcoin happened to every protocol and successful technology.
Better protocols than HTTP were proposed, and died, and HTTP was improved. Today we have HTTP/2, which could have been conceived many many years ago, but it's here and it's working and it's backwards-compatible.
Better solutions than JavaScript as the scripting language of the web were proposed. JavaScript was continuously declared doomed, incomplete, silly, a toy, etc, compared to other languages. JavaScript evolved, became faster (thanks to JIT and tracing compilers), incorporated better syntax and features.
It's very easy to see the rise of an incredibly exciting technology (Bitcoin) and poke holes at it and claim that you'll take the idea, re-brand it and make it better.
What's hard is to evolve the existing system. There are lots of variables in play, compatibility with existing systems, politics and people to deal with. But history shows the evolutionary approach always wins.
Personally, I look forward to seeing Ethereum experiment and demonstrate great functionality that we can all benefit from (like the Rootstock.io project is doing).

This is absolutly not the case. If Bitcoin is declared *illegal*, you would stop using it even if they can't technically block it. You would stop using it because governments have the monopoly over the use of force. They can stop you with a wrench (

The Japanese are probably very frustrated with their economic present. Bitcoin is one of those risky bets that can have ridiculous exponential returns on a global scale (10000X+), as opposed to the progressive linear recovery (if any) of their local economy.

It's not what they want me to believe, it's what reason leads me to believe. It's what history of similar centralization vs decentralization situations leads me to believe.
Since you don't believe the Netflix example, here's a presentation from Spotify on why they *removed* their P2P network because it had a *negative and unpredictable effect on performance*, even though it was more cost-effective (since users were using their bandwidth to seed other users).
@_date: 2016-04-17 02:22:25
It's actually the opposite.
There's an inherent tension between decentralization and throughput. 
If you want to scale quickly, you have to centralize.
This is why Netflix is able to provide a better service than, for example, BitTorrent. It's because they control all the nodes and can carefully monitor, measure and improve latency.
@_date: 2015-12-13 00:59:07
One way to mitigate this risk is to make governments depend on the blockchain because of its data store properties (immutability and scale). 
For example, if the blockchain becomes a widespread means of document notarization, then banning the currency will compromise stability.
The beauty of Bitcoin is that it's two things: a log and a currency. The log needs the currency, and the currency needs the log.

"Currently, paying a fee is controlled manually with the -paytxfee switch.  It would be very easy to make the software automatically check the size of recent blocks to see if it should pay a fee.  We're so far from reaching the threshold, we don't need that yet.  It's a good idea to see how things go with controlling it manually first anyway.
It's not a big deal if we reach the threshold.  Free transactions would just take longer to get into a block."

my question is: where are these mythical OTC traders ?
@_date: 2016-06-20 06:44:40
Yes. I would say Lightning is a better system than the banks Hal suggests. However, it's in principle very similar: you commit and lock funds so that transacting with them later becomes faster.
@_date: 2016-02-21 18:23:06
No, it doesn't buy you time. It increases the throughput of transactions that *still* take an hour to be *verified* by many miners.
Increasing the throughput of zero-conf transactions won't make you compete with Visa.
@_date: 2016-02-21 19:28:41
It definitely can't happen with bigger blocks :) It could happen with the exact opposite: microblocks. See Bitcoin NG: 
You're barking up the wrong tree.

Don't forget a lot of the technology that fuels Bitcoin was directly created or sponsored by government agencies (like NSA or the military). Governments are powerful.

I forgot to mention this. Bitcoin NG *is* a scaling strategy, and *would* allow Bitcoin to compete with Visa.
@_date: 2016-02-21 18:20:56
I don't think you get it. Bitcoin can't "take on Visa". They do completely different things.
@_date: 2016-02-21 19:28:02
The reversing still goes through Visa. They're voluntarily providing you that option.
@_date: 2016-02-08 23:16:31
This, by the way, is what will make all the "Bitcoin payment" services irrelevant (such as BitPay or Coinbase widgets and buttons). Every shop that accepts PayPal will "suddenly" accept Bitcoin.
To end-users, the experience will improve dramatically. When Paypal is tied into a Bank Account now, funds take several days to clear.
Paypal will show two balances: USD and Bitcoin. When you Pay, it'll be a "funding source". Bitcoin gets converted to USD at time of payment.
Merchants will be allowed to accept Bitcoin directly as well when they set up the Paypal link.

He makes a good point towards the end. Governments can stop Bitcoin by censoring the internet. Traffic analyses would allow them to filter P2P connections to Bitcoin full nodes.
@_date: 2016-02-23 01:15:00
They're still not likely to be attacked because of the low incentive to double-spend something so small.
@_date: 2016-02-21 19:29:42
Agreed. I wonder why the discussion has not been centered around reducing block times?
@_date: 2016-02-21 18:29:59
It's two sides of the same coin (no pun intended :P). The presence of a proof-of-work system *implies* latency.
That's why Bitcoin can't possibly have sub-second confirmations like a closed system with Paxos consensus could. That's why Bitcoin as it is can't be compared with Visa.

The difference is that the cloud hype had a very concrete implementation: AWS. 
What's the concrete "private Blockchain" all these people are talking about?
It sounds like water vapor. I agree with pmarca on this:
A "private blockchain" will be some sort of database with an API. It's not clear yet how it's gonna work, whether it'll actually be rolled out and implemented, what it'll be used for, by who, etc.
Bitcoin is different. Bitcoin is 7 years old. It keeps growing. Improving. Evolving.
@_date: 2016-02-21 18:24:53
If you increase the size of the block, you're merely increasing the throughput of zero-conf transactions. It still takes you an hour to *confirm* a transaction. You're still not able to compete with closed systems that have a network of private nodes with minimal latency between them.
In order to compete with a system like that, you need to move transactions off-chain, and trade off something.
@_date: 2016-02-23 01:14:00
Do you have data to back this up?
@_date: 2016-02-21 18:32:44


It's not about when. It's more like *never*, it *can't happen*. You're increasing the throughput of zero-confirmation easy-to-double-spend transactions per second.
Even if you make block sizes SO big that you can handle just as many as Visa[1], I can't perform double-spend attacks on merchants accepting Visa transactions, but I can on merchants accepting Bitcoin. In fact already demonstrated the flaw in accepting zero-confirmation transactions as true.
And to be clear, when I speak of Visa, I don't know about their current implementation (like showed). I'm talking about a theoretical closed system with many computers and a consensus algorithm between them that's drastically faster than Bitcoin's (as it should be).
[1] and in the process you would be destroying Bitcoin, because nodes wouldn't be able to handle that bandwidth or processing costs. And at the end you'd end up with a centralized system that's actually less efficient than the centralized system you're trying to beat :|

This codebase is also remarkably well-written, clean, complete and tested.

Important to note: governments can still very easily just enforce miners to block this type of transaction.
It's akin to governments requiring a Tax ID or considering your activity as a business illegal otherwise.
The only way this would work is if the entire system forces everyone to "hide" transactions. Which I assume not everyone would be interested in, since "actors that don't have anything to hide" won't be interested in revealing their transaction data 60 minutes later. It's more effort and time!

Keep in mind email is still a decentralized service. The big "datacenters" are Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook but then there are other massive ones in Russia and China.
This is equivalent to big mining pools in Bitcoin.

If you just focus on the wording, "The tech behind Bitcoin" doesn't make any sense. Bitcoin *is* a technology. The technology behind the technology is a redundancy.
Another way to put it is, Bitcoin is TCP/IP, and we're getting a bunch of articles about how TCP alone will change your life. Doubtful.

Bitcoin offers strong probabilistic consistency. The orphaned blocks were never to be trusted to begin with, and have nothing to do with the property of immutability of a database.
@_date: 2016-07-24 01:34:40
Sure, but that's why Bitcoin's consistency is probabilistic. You're choosing to *knowingly* gamble and accept the tradeoffs. It's built into the rules. Wait longer and that probability approaches 0.
On the other hand, a blockchain whose leaders create an ad-hoc protocol for a fork that's not specified within the rules (for example, the spawning of a new website for coin voting, no designated rules of thresholds to be met, arbitrary decision times, arbitrary fixes to third party contracts or applications, and so on), does not exhibit proven immutability.
