Fuck testing. If I pay them to write the code they should be doing it correctly the whole time!!!!!!!

Apple is the Canada of tech blame.

No. 4K refers to the resolution of the TV, although the actual 4K standard is a digital cinema resolution standard allowing for a full frame resolution of 4096x2160, and a flat (1.85:1) resolution of 3996x2160 (Scope resolution is 4096x1716 for a 2.39:1 AR).
TV resolution for 4K is slightly smaller than the cinema standard, and is really only a buzzword in terms of standards, trying to equate your TV to a cinema.

No, it is the other i. Close, though.

here. We are pretty well accustomed to far-fetched "I'll eat my ____" challenges, and we enjoy watching them on their day of reckoning. Carry on.

Effectively, in daily use of credit cards across the world, you get your goods the moment that receipt prints out. We can get technical here if we want, but unless Bitcoin has a system for you getting your products/services immediately, then it isn't any better for the average consumer.

I may have taken it from the wrong point of view. I should have assumed they wouldn't be focusing concern on the consumer.

This is effectively the only response that will be given here.

A lot of good that new gear is doing... With profits that big they should have gear that can handle at least 3 times the traffic of their biggest peak traffic ever. And if it ever exceeds that previously recorded peak, they need to update their gear.

I just heard him say that Bitcoin is faster than credit cards. No. It isn't.

Last time I checked, it took a full 60 minutes to 2 hours for my transactions to complete. Am I horribly mistaken here?
EDIT: and from a consumer point of view, that is much slower than a credit card for getting me the items I've purchased. Perhaps it is faster from a merchant's point of view, but the consumer has to wait longer than they would while purchasing a commodity with a credit card.

Shit, at those prices? Good lord. Befriend an angsty teenager.

That was an amusing TL;DR. Thank you for that.
