I prefer gdax because its an American company but, every once in awhile I trade on cex for the variety in coins. both exchanges are usa friendly which is good for me

you should check out cex.io there price is almost always overvalued. once the spread is large enough people will arbitrage just depends on how easy it is to move usd between exchanges

You don't have to buy a full bitcoin :) I am not so sure bitcoin will ever be that cheap again

well if you end up posting the full picture i can use a brute force program on the digits that are iffy

well if it was decentralized it would still need a middleman someone to solve disputes and award payment. Definitely possible though. You could use a trust system for middlemen and set it up like OpenBazaar where middleman earn a small commission for being trustful

look man you post a story of a woman who tried to sell 3 months ago but was unable due to hitbtc's poor verification system this has nothing to do with the day of verification (as i like to call it) this was a person who got screwed by hitbtc. I am participating in this and so far no exchanges have shown a lack of funds time will tell but, dont be so quick to judge the exchanges just yet

lol I think you misread my post they use the 25$ worth of btc to post ads on "backpage" im not buying time with an escort 
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:23:40
My main job is selling bitcoins to escorts. hell at least 60 % of all trades on paxful are escorts. escorts buy amazon gift card &gt;&gt;&gt; escort sells amazon gift card on paxful&gt;&gt;&gt; escort can now use bitcoin for ad on backpage&gt;&gt;&gt; I use amazon gift card to buy items on purse.io for btc rinse.repeat

There should be a list of payment methods on the left hand side "[PAX](
there is no true safe method instead you trade with people based on there reputation/feedback.
or you trade with them based on gut feeling for example most escorts have low feedback due to being new but are usually 99% honest (easy way to identify is to look at the pics they send most escorts have really nice nails [1]( on the other hand there are a lot of indians/africans that are only there to try and scam most will speak with broken English or pressure you to finish trade fast.
