no dumb ass not declining a transaction and then illegally running it in order that it benefits you is illegal they got sued for it.
before you call somebody a dumb ass do some research

lets not forget that Wellsfargo (bank)charged you in order so that you would occur the most fees if you were negative, i remember clearly how i got burned once paying 300 for a pack of gum because it was 10 cents short it went through, should have been declined then charged me 35 for being negative and 35 for a few months, before I realized at that time I was only 14, I went in to explain what had happened and they didn't care about it whatsoever or show any remorse. oh well you owe this amount if you dont pay it it'll affect your credit. assholes. something I will never forget and I will not care if I dont use them again.

yup the corporations have used us too much and got away with it now we can walk away.

they eventually got rid of that practice because reordering your transactions is illegal, also you should have the option of opting out of it instead of getting hit with fees if negative. now you can opt out but this is 15 years ago they screwed alot of people before they got called out and had to change this practice basically predatory practices.
