First, thank you for contributing and sharing your thoughts.  I hope we can have more intelligent discourse without name-calling and extreme bias.


This is an interesting point -- partially true, but subject to misinterpretation.  
We are creating value where there was none before.  Yes, if I buy at 1000 and sell at 500, then somebody else who buys at 500 and sells at 1000 (i.e. the opposite direction) is essentially taking profit from my loss.  But if we all buy at 500, and Bitcoin is worth 3000 next year (hypothetically), then we all gain.  And new Bitcoin is created every day.
I'm not arguing with you.  I just wanted to clarify this point about profit/loss in an exponentially growing commodity, the likes of which has never been witnessed by most people on such a timescale.

OP is ridiculous.  MtGox has been widely considered the  exchange for years and has essentially defined the exchange price of Bitcoin.
The fact that they shut down withdrawals with barely any communication (their typical MO) which has resulted in a major price crash, and that they may end up being insolvent and disappearing a lot of people's money is literally the most significant thing happening to Bitcoin right now or even in recent months.
But no, let's not talk about that!  Let's give them the 12th benefit of the doubt and assume they just need a little quiet time to fix everything.  Keep the focus on emerging markets, libertarian ideals, and colored coins everybody!

Nobody forces people to use Western Union. They are a business providing a service. If you don't like it, don't use it.  They appear no more "evil" than any other for profit business, and unless you can demonstrate actual evil doing, it's really silly to keep being so passionate about it. 
Making absolute moral judgements without any argument to back them up is a horribly ineffective way to communicate, and even more so when the facts are exaggerated or plain wrong.
Maybe they are evil and I am open to hearing about their child slave labor remittance camps and sex traffic side business. But just saying they're evil because they make profit on a service they provide doesn't carry an weight.

You are telling people who are protesting to "chill out" and painting them as unreasonable.  So your bias is 100% clear.  And your faith/assumption is unfounded. 
The history of Bitcoin is filled with scammers large and small, cons short and long.  And the history of MtGox is filled with so much incompetence, spin, and lack of transparency that only a fool would continue to give them the benefit of the doubt and keep believing that all the market manipulation was entirely accidental.
You are entitled to your opinion, and I did not downvote your post, despite disagreeing with it.

This is what you were responding to:


50 years ago a computer less powerful than your cell phone took up an entire building.  Bitcoin block rewards are expected to last for longer than another 50 years.  SHA-256 may have vulnerabilities not yet (commonly) known.  Do you really believe that this is not a realistic future?
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:39:44
I did audit bitaddress.  Several times.  I also check the SHA hash of the file to verify it wasn't tampered with.  But it's a huge amount of code using unfamiliar math, so I defer to other people who also have reviewed it and likely would have raised alerts if there were problems.
Get it?  That's how communities work.  The more eyes on something, the more likely somebody smarter and more specifically skilled than you will find a problem.
When you have something new (like Piper) that only a few people have seen, it's harder to trust.  The answer is only "do it yourself" to rude unimaginative elitists.

OK here's a question for you: let's say the price keeps going up (which seems likely at least for the next week or two).  If you committed personally to buying in in the $40-50ish range (i.e. about a week ago), what's the highest price you'll pay by the time your money is in Mt Gox?

You know how when you call somebody on the phone, and they pick up before it even rings and say "that's so weird - I was just picking up the phone to call you!"
Doesn't happen very often, but maybe you've experienced that a few times in your life.
OK now imagine that happening every time you try to call anybody for a whole month.  That would be REALLY weird.
And now imagine it happens for everybody in the world, so that for a few months phones never ring at all.  People just pick up as they are being called, as if by some strange cosmic coincidence.  Getting super creepy, right?
Well (I didn't do the math, but) that's probably a lot MORE likely than two Bitcoin addresses ever randomly colliding.

**PSA:  Anybody who trusts their Bitcoins to an unreviewed minified/obfuscated chunk of JavaScript on the web is a complete fool.**  It's *extremely* difficult to do all of this correctly even if you are trying.  Proper random number generation is essential, and that's just a small part of it all.  
These sites are total jokes, either by scammers or misguided developers.  Look at  for an example of how to properly provide something that people can trust:  plain code (not minimized/obfuscated), SHA hash built into the URL itself, etc.  You shouldn't even really trust that 100%, but it's a hell of a lot better than all these knockoffs.
@_date: 2013-10-20 03:56:01
Yes. And apologies for the jackasses who are downvoting you for asking a simple question.
Miners have the option of keeping or selling their BTC.  If they invest more money into creating them (because higher network hash rate = higher difficulty = more hardware+energy costs), then they will expect a higher price to sell them, or else they might be more likely to hang on to them instead.
While the miners' supply is a small fraction of total BTC volume, and there are wildly powerful and speculative external forces at play manipulating the markets, it is nonetheless true that there is a linear correlation between hash rate (i.e. difficulty) and price -- even if it is dwarfed by larger forces.

In the real world, most "sellers" are businesses with large cash flow and most "buyers" are smaller individuals with less tolerance for spending 2x what an items costs.
So your proposal wouldn't really work.  touched on this below.  The seller could easily send an empty box.  Now at this point, consider the choice the buyer has:  a) do nothing and end up with nothing, or b) accept the transaction and end up with $X.  With no other options, that's a very easy choice, and the seller wins every time.
The fact that the seller typically has both a higher risk/cashflow tolerance which can be more easily amortized over a large number of transactions as well as only half as much invested as the buyer makes this an incredibly unbalanced situation.
But without even getting into that at all, do you really think most consumers would be willing to front 2x what an item costs?  Why do you think there is so much credit card debt and pawn shops and Pay-day advance/check cashing stores all over the place?

I understand the motivation for change to go to new change addresses by default, but... 
The fact that it is enabled by default, hidden, and unknown to new users (such that we frequently hear about people losing coins or just being confused), and that devs seem to be OK with all of that suggests that Bitcoin-qt is likely to lose relevance as the primary consumer client as more friendly alternatives become available.  Similar evidence is the way transaction fees default to 0, and you have to know they even exist and find them in the settings to change that.
But is it bad if Bitcoin-qt will become marginalized as a reference implementation of software powering network nodes?  Maybe, maybe not.  But it does mean that the core developers are going to lose some power and control and that corporate interests might get more involved.  E.g. if "Google Bitcoin Client" becomes popular, suddenly Google+ integrations make certain transactions safer, and in the long run the whole network becomes very different from the original vision.
I don't feel strongly about whether the client should default to sending change back to the same address.  There are valid reasons for and against.  But I do want to make clear that as Bitcoin becomes more mainstream, the developers should AT LEAST be aware of the "human" and UI issues surrounding use of the client, or be prepared to cede control to 3rd parties and corporate interests who know better how to pander to lowest common denominator users.

Once Bitcoin becomes a properly traded currency, the "BTC" moniker will have to be dropped.  Why?  See all currencies are referenced by an [ISO-4217]( 3-character code (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.) of which the first 2 characters are the [ISO-3166]( country code (US, EU, GB, etc.).
Here's a big table listing all of this data together:
Now in addition to country currencies, ISO 4217 includes commodities like metals, expressed in price per troy ounce.  The metals start with "X" followed by the chemical symbol (XAG, XAU, XPT).
Bitcoin is already being considered "XBT" although it isn't official yet.  Here is some info on XBT:
So what I actually propose would be best is to allocate an entirely new ISO-3166 prefix for stateless crypto-currencies.  There aren't many prefixes available, but maybe something like "CE" for crypto-currency electronic.
Then we would get:
* CEB - Bitcoins, in "mBTC"
* CEL - Litcoins, in "mLTC"
* ... etc ...
Most everybody seems to agree that mBTC is the best unit for now and the future, but if we just circle jerk around it on forums, nothing will happen.  We need to actually subvert this momentum on "XBT" and push for real standardization as described above.  Now is the time to set this in stone before ISO decides on their own!  Who is with me on this?

There are many simple things the exchanges could do RIGHT NOW to patch their ridiculous vulnerability to DDoS and bot traffic. In the long run maybe it's not necessary and perhaps a discrete double auction as proposed in the article is the right solution (we could at least try), but it's pretty obvious that right now we need fast simple executable solutions.  Limiting trades per minute and having a volume floor are two very obvious ones that implemented be done in a day.

He gets a "20 year" archival paper from the manufacturer.  Nonetheless, this, like any thermal printer, is clearly not meant for true archiving.  However it looks great for medium term storage and transfer.  
It also has a USB port and can generate and backup keys to USB, so there are other uses besides printing as well.

Well you (OP) sound computer literate enough to be legitimately scared, and now I'm scared too.  I don't even use Firefox and I just spent 10 minutes Googling about its default file upload directory, etc. with no success.  I honestly don't understand the ignorance of the downvote brigade here... 
"JavaScript can't do that!"  Jesus Christ, has nobody heard of an exploit before?  What a bunch of head-in-sand-burying ignoramuses!  
JavaScript isn't designed to have access to files outside the browser sandbox, but it's certainly possible that some clever hacker found a new exploit and specifically targeted Linux Firefox users (who probably correlate with Bitcoin users more than average) and installed their exploit on a vulnerable Wordpress server (e.g.) that hosts Bitcoin-related content.
Maybe there's another explanation, but this deserves to be taken somewhat seriously.

BIP38 was somehow rushed/snuck by the normal BIP process and never fully vetted.  It is secure so far in that there are no known vulnerabilities, but there are issues.  It is likely that it will be deprecated and something else (more thoroughly reviews) will take its place.

What if the exploit is something like "*Debug code left in production build of Firefox release 13482 allows malicious JavaScript to access user filesystem*" and the residual file upload directory is just an artifact of that?  And the hacker installs his JavaScript on a popular Bitcoin blog running on old vulnerable Wordpress, and collects information on that server and forwards it to himself?
The point is that if it's a zero day exploit that nobody knows about yet, then how the hell do you feel confident telling everybody what JavaScript can and can't do?
Why not take your argument to the next level and say "*If there was a Firefox exploit, they'd wait until you weren't home and break into your house and steal all your money*".  Do you actually know anything about how software works and how it can be exploited?

Right that's an obvious way to bypass these issues.  And I suppose you could then boot a LiveCD and type the keys directly into a new wallet.dat to verify them.  A huge error-prone hassle, yet safe.
But every time "paper wallets" come up, it sounds like people are just happily printing them.  So that's the issue I'm getting at.  Is nobody considering the attack surface of consumer printers?  
These products are already known to have various undocumented anti-counterfeiting and hidden watermark features built in, so why do we trust them for this purpose of "safe" cold storage?

The excessive circle jerking is actually good for Bitcoin.  The fact that people like OP are complaining about it is evidence that Bitcoin is now a legitimate phenomenon.  I expect $10K by year end!

There has been a steady climb up through the 40s this month, then starting this week a very fast ascension to over 70.  Then this morning there was a big dip then recovery.
It may not be noteworthy, but it's interesting and worth discussing why any of this is happening.  I also believe there are a LOT of people on the sidelines waiting to make a play, so understanding these dips will also help more people get invested.

Wow... What's with the obnoxious 'tude?  The main purpose of this product is to be a turnkey solution for wallet generation and printing.
When I log in to my Bank of America web account, I don't set up a packet dumping proxy and manually read all the JavaScript to make sure it's doing what I think it is (despite all of this being "open" and available for review).  I just trust that they wouldn't screw me.  When I type my BoA password into Coinbase for verification, I *sort of* trust that they won't screw me, but I change my password afterward.  
Piper is a brand new product from a brand new company with no reputation on the line and the potential to defraud people of billions of dollars.  So your answer is just "figure it out yourself"?  Very helpful, thanks for contributing.  But:
- I'm not qualified to look at a circuit board and know what might be a miniature cellular modem disguised as something else.
- I'm not qualified to look at thousands of lines of complicated cryptography code with embedded magic constants and know what it's doing.
- I'm not qualified to evaluate the randomness of a hardware random number generator.
- I'm not qualified to determine what is a real Raspberry Pi board vs. a perfectly made knockoff with hidden ROM overrides.
- etc.
And you know what?  I doubt that you are either (despite you probably thinking you are).  More importantly, I don't have the time, and if I wanted to do all that, I probably would just build my own from scratch.
"Do it yourself" is how innovation begins.  It's not the answer to everything.

This is very interesting.  Can you explain a bit more how you imagine Bitcoin developing in this regard?
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:51:47
Bitcoin is decentralized, yes, but an exchange is anything but.  Almost by definition, it's a central marketplace where people come to trade.  Ideally there would be few rules, but pragmatically you have to look at how it's being used.  If hundreds of 0.001 BTC trades are jamming up the trade engine and causing multiple minutes of lag, then only a fool would value lack of regulation over timeliness.  That kind of HFT doesn't benefit anybody except a few traders, and it's at the cost of an entire marketplace.
And let's be real here.  August 2012?  As in $10/BTC August 2012?  That was a *long* time ago in Bitcoin time.  You want to talk real recent numbers?  Look here:  
30-day volume in USD = $267,687,118.00
With approx txn fee 0.5% = $1,338,435.59 = **$45k/day**
As for trades per second, one only has to look at any of the visualizations of the trade data coming off the Mt. Gox websockets API such as  and you can see exactly what's going on in terms of transactions per second, trade engine lag, and API fragility.
And their PR isn't just lacking in professionalism.  It's lacking in content, timeliness, and honesty.  Was there a DDoS or not?  They can't even get their own story straight, they're so busy patting themselves on the back.  And what is a DDoS anyway in this context?  Is it a packet flood from a botnet?  Or is it really a bunch of bots putting in orders their engine is too dumb to filter out?
What is it in your psychology that makes you want to defend them so much?  They are incompetent, failed to prepare for the obvious, and seem to continue to half-ass their way through every crisis.  I'm honestly asking you now:  why are you so defensive?  Would you be so gracious if NASDAQ handled stock market trades like this?


In the next few weeks/months, I and many others are going to do just that.  They may have been the first and biggest, but they're quickly MySpaceing themselves into obscurity.

Bitcoin has a long way to go for mass user adoption -- largely in more user-friendly and safe wallets.
But I wouldn't hold up a bunch of guys in who are "at an [8]" as the metric for how accessible Bitcoin is.  By that measure traffic lights and pencils are probably very difficult concepts.  :-)

If I was pulling in even a fraction of the $50k+ per DAY like they've been, I'd be able to build a trading engine that didn't fall apart under loads of 5 trades per second.  20 years ago people were running higher transaction volume on single core Pentiums.
I'd also be smart enough not to allow single users to spam the order books with duplicate low volume trades -- either limiting # of open orders, # orders placed per second or minute or hour, or any number of other basic limits.
And I would hire PR people to communicate with the public before, during, and after major events.  I wouldn't ignore my Twitter feed and release bullshit congratulatory press releases while my business was burning.
But feel free to keep looking the other way and giving them pass after pass.  The company is shit, plain and simple, and they've demonstrated it time and time again.

Yep I agree completely.  So basically buy now at $70 because assuming 4-digit long term price target, it's not worth the risk that there ISN'T going to be a bubble burst to make it more "affordable" in the near future?
