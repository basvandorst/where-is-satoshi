Charges aren't really relevant. Bitcoin transaction fees can't be (as far as I know) used to permit/deny transfers on an arbitrary or political basis like current payment processors can be influenced to (and are).

Singularity don't need money, money is just a way of dealing with constrained resources.

Assuming a $1500 spot price that's a $110 service fee for a stamp press hit that takes half a second. 
It's kind of a neat idea, I'd consider throwing a 25gr fun size in my wallet for the zombie apocalypse, but that commission is silly.

Man from the future and all you talk is classical economics that are being disrupted by a whole lot more than bitcoin.
Where's the automation, the strong AI, the advances in energy technology? Come on future man, talk about something futurey. 
Money is just a proxy for energy.

It's not about the "cut", it's that the current system allows payment processors to dictate what *legal* items may or may not be paid for, based only on corporate policy.
Bitcoin allows an irreversible cash-like transaction with no possibility of a policy-setting middleman; potentially lower transaction fees are just a bonus.

I find the elimination of payments middlemen to be the most compelling part of Bitcoin, assuming it goes mainstream.

Where did I say anything about the tax man?
I was thinking of the Paypal man that doesn't allow firearms sales and the Visa man that doesn't allow donations to Wikileaks or other political protest groups.

I think your ideas are reasonable, except for this.
Email co-evolved with the internet, it's one of the living fossils of the old world (DNS is another...). It was dependent on and limited by mass adoption of the underlying transport technologies, which are now established and commodity.
Bitcoin is an application from the new world, a world where TCP/IP transport is just another utility service. I think a better comparison *technically* would be to the adoption of social networks.
I don't have a whole lot of personal investment in Bitcoin or particular interest in currency meta so I'm not going to run the numbers or speculate on economic things I have no real knowledge of, but I think 10-15 years would be a more accurate baseline for the calculations.
