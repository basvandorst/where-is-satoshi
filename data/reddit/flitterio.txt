Thanks to for this:


One way to do that is by using Dust-B-Gone. A script written by Peter Todd, one of the bitcoin core developers. It takes those transactions and sends them to his server where they are all combined and spent in a transaction with a 0 BTC output, effectively giving the dust to the miners.


Dust-B-Gone can be found here: 
Alternatively, you can move all other coins out of the address to which the dust spam was sent, then destroy the private key for that address, forever destroying the dust. This can't be done with addresses created by [deterministic wallets]( such as Electrum, because the "destroyed" private key can be recovered from the wallet seed.
@_date: 2014-04-08 02:39:57
I wish you all the best. So glad I use Electrum.
@_date: 2014-02-12 04:02:41
OK, yes, but if it could be made truly unique (by fixing the malleability issue in all wallets and nodes), then nodes could drop all this DoS traffic at the first node that detected a duplicate txid. It would never propagate.

Try to use them. If you are asked to enter a passphrase, then they are encrypted.

The second spend will be ignored by any nodes that have the first spend in their mempools. If no miner includes the first spend in a block (because, say, there was no fee), eventually it drops out of most/all nodes' mempools, opening the door to the second spend. The question is: how long does it take for a TX to drop out of most nodes' mempools?

Yes. The [difficulty]( is the ratio **maximum_target / current_target**. As total hashpower goes up, the current target goes down proportionally. Since the target is inversely proportional to the total hashpower, and the difficulty is inversely proportional to the target, then it follows that the difficulty is proportional to the total hashpower. The constant of proportionality would be a function of the maximum target and the time period 10 minutes.

And the payment processor is contractually obligated to give the value of those BTC to the vendor. What do you care if they give it in dollars, rubles, gold, or Litecoin? It's a private contract between the processor and the vendor, just as the BTC are someone else's private property once you give them away.

All good points. Another thing a VM can bring to the table is the ability to roll-back to a snapshot (VMware terminology; other VMs may call them something else). If you are confident the snapshot is devoid of malware, rolling back to it helps you be sure you're using a clean environment. Of course, you should keep your wallet offline, otherwise you roll it back with the rest of the VM.
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:48:55


No, no, no. A virtual machine protects the host from the guest — not the guest from the host. Having your wallet software on a VM does not make it secure from malware on the host. Boot off a live [Ubuntu]( DVD and store your wallet on a USB thumb drive.

The unencrypted wallet.dat is enough. Yes, the passphrase encrypts the private keys, but it may also encrypt the entire wallet (each wallet software can do this differently).

The blockchain could certainly act as a public "dead drop" for anonymously-sourced digitally signed advertisements and encrypted bids and replies. The problem is that "anonymously-sourced" part. All the ads, bids, buyer-seller communication would have to enter the blockchain via miners and nodes, who see the originating IP address of each transaction. Now, you could use Tor or I2P to obfuscate the true IP address for each transaction, but it's not perfect.

It's optional, of course. Plenty of people/organizations (especially charities and donation-based orgs) publicly associate their identity with a Bitcoin address. And most exchanges require your identity as part of KYC/AML adherence.

My guess (which could be totally wrong) is they're gadflies who want to force exchanges to fix the transaction malleability bug. They may also be the hackers who used said bug to trick Gox into giving out more BTC than they should have, and now that Gox is offline (for withdrawals), this is all they have left.

Only if you don't backup your Bitcoin-qt addresses and private keys. You can import your Bitcoin-qt private keys into Electrum, and use them in Electrum ... but Electrum is a deterministic wallet (it derives all of its own key-pairs from a secret seed, a string of 12 random words), so your imported Bitcoin-qt key-pairs are not backed up when you back up the seed. You will forever have to back them up manually (unless you transfer all of your BTC into your Electrum-generated addresses). Hope this helps.

Yes. And if the malware sees you type the passphrase (or if it waits for you to type your passphrase), then it can access your private keys, which it sends back to its master, who then transfers your BTC out of your control. The transaction probably wasn't even generated on your machine.

If ECDSA were broken, you could compute a private key from a public key (not from an address, though). So if you saw a transaction sending BTC from an address, you could take the public key of that address (which you have, because it's in the transaction), compute the private  key, and transfer any BTC out of it that it had received afterwards.

A far bigger problem would result from ECDSA being broken. Then Bitcoin private keys could be computed from Bitcoin addresses, and everyone would have access to everyone else's money. The very definition of "bad news".

Every browser would complain if it initiated an HTTPS connection and only got plain old HTTP at the other end. They are incompatible protocols.
You may be thinking of the case where a user enters an HTTP URL into Tor Browser, the exit node connects to the site, which sends an HTTP redirect to the HTTPS site. The (malicious) exit node drops the redirect and engages in a SSL connection with the HTTPS site, but talks only HTTP to the browser (i.e., a MITM attack). It is up to the user to notice that the address bar shows an HTTP URL instead of an HTTPS URL, and if the user fails to notice, he's boned.

OK, yes, and that's exactly how double spends are normally rejected by well-connected nodes. But poorly connected or malicious nodes can forward double spends to lots of other nodes and miners. Then you have a race between two spends of the same coins to get into the blockchain. Two miners might each mine one of the two spends, creating a small fork in the blockchain (it happens almost daily — see  The ultimate arbiter of which spend is real and which is a double spend is always the longest blockchain.

The current target (in hexadecimal) is this 256-bit number:
Look at all those leading zero bits! Imagine how unlikely it is that any random SHA256 hash output is smaller than that number. When miners repeatedly hash a candidate block, they make small changes to it between each hash hoping that the next hash output will be less than the target.
Every two weeks, the target is moved (usually down) which increases the difficulty of finding a block. This is done to keep the average block production rate at 1 block every 10 minutes.

You can still create an encrypted container (of an arbitrary size), which TrueCrypt will mount as a drive letter so you can access its contents. It's the same strong encryption that's used if you encrypt an entire partition/driver. This has the advantage of allowing you to back up the encrypted container, which appears to be a file filled with very random bits. There isn't even a header pattern that marks the file as a TC container. Though to be fair, there are apps that scan for files with high degrees of entropy and report them as possible TC containers.

I suspect that Blockchain.info shows the unconfirmed transaction (and others don't) because it was generated by them and still exists in their database. Maybe it will be there forever. Maybe it will disappear in a while. But even Blockchain.info shows one of the TXs as confirmed and the other as unconfirmed, so they are in agreement with the blockchain as to which TX really happened and which didn't.

No, because the seed exists to do just that. If you are worried about someone finding your written seed, I see that you have 3 choices:
1. Hide it better (e.g., in a safe deposit box).
1. Don't write it down — instead encrypt it in a file using one of the tools mentioned in other replies. If you lose all the digitally encrypted copies, you have lost all your Bitcoin.
1. Memorize it really well, so you never forget it.


Electrum does exactly that for operations that can cost you money (assuming you have set a password in the first place). Your Electrum wallet is encrypted using your password.

It would irrefutably prove that the given Bitcoin address is associated with the given email address.

I agree it may not (yet) be possible. Something has to do the computation and network traffic to generate the transaction that sends your BTC to your children's addresses, so in a sense you have to trust that thing. Unless you are thinking of some time-bounded P2SH transaction (does such a thing even exist?), where your heirs can take the BTC only if you haven't moved the funds to yet another time-bounded transaction that doesn't make the funds available for another 6 months. But even then it requires your heirs to come get the BTC when the time-bound expires, right?

The inputs to your transaction are some or all of the outputs of one or more earlier transactions targeting the addresses you choose to supply funds. Suppose last week, transaction TX1 sent three outputs to addresses A1 (1 BTC), A2 (2 BTC), and A3 (3 BTC) in your wallet, such that you have 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 BTC in your wallet, but spread over three addresses. You command your wallet to send 4 BTC to someone at address A4. Your wallet will make transaction TX2 that has the three outputs of TX1 as input (total 6 BTC) and has two outputs: 4 BTC to A4 and 2 BTC back to a change address (A5). Now if A5 is A3, then it will look like some of the "balance" in A3 was not moved, but in reality each output of TX1 is completely consumed in this example.
Note that TX2 doesn't need to use every output of TX1 if it doesn't need all the funds. That's another way a "balance" can be left behind in an address when you send from it.

Sort of. Certainly that 10% is not considered spent until it appears in the blockchain. But keep in mind that the blockchain does not track balances. It's not like you have an "account" in a database with a number that's the balance. The blockchain tracks transactions that move Bitcoins (or fractions of them) from the block where they were mined (in a special transaction called the "coinbase") through TX inputs and outputs in all subsequent blocks. Only by seeing the entire blockchain since the creation of a set of Bitcoins can you know which private keys "own" which fractions of them. Miners and full nodes do that (see the full blockchain), which is how they prevent double-spends.

Good points. My mistake was to make the friendly name something that has value elsewhere (i.e., an email address). Suppose it's not an email address, but a user-chosen nickname (e.g., "jollyroger259"). It still works as a decentralized trust-free mapping from a friendly name to a Bitcoin address. First come, first serve. The payee still has to give the friendly name to the payer to get paid.
I suppose someone could DoS this design by spamming the blockchain with every combination of a few words and some numbers, binding each one to an address. One way to prevent that would be to require proof-of-work: publish an address/friendly-name/nonce triple that hashes to less than the current target (or one of the last N targets). This gives miners a new business: selling friendly names.

If you just run it on the same Windows machine that you do all your surfing and day-to-day activity on, you are taking a risk.

You have the private keys. Import them into a local wallet (Bitcoin-qt, Electrum, Armory, etc.), create a new blockchain.info wallet, use the local client to transfer the BTC from your old addresses to an address in the new blockchain.info wallet, then delete your old blockchain.info wallet.

Interesting idea. It requires trust only for the fiat half of the sale of Bitcoins. Would it work something like this?
1. The buyer and seller digitally sign statements to the exchange that X BTC will be transferred from addresses A0..An to address B for Y amount of fiat. Signatures are made using the corresponding private keys to prove ownership.
2. The exchange receives fiat plus fee from the buyer (trust happens here). Exchange tells the seller it has the fiat.
3. Seller sends the BTC directly to buyer as agreed.
4. The exchange validates the transaction, either by running a well-connected node (for small amounts) or waiting for confirmations in the blockchain (for larger amounts).
5. If the input/output addresses match the earlier digitally signed promise, the exchange gives the fiat to the seller, otherwise the fiat is returned to the buyer.
Exchange software could make this fast by having the customers register their addresses (but not send any BTC) in advance. This could also allow the exchange to somewhat verify BTC ownership by the seller. If the seller is to pay the fee, then the seller sends a small amount of his fiat to the exchange in advance to act as a balance from which fees are deducted.
**tl;dr: An exchange operates without holding any BTC. Trust is only required for the fiat half of the sale.**

[Public-key cryptography]( in a nutshell:
* Keys come in pairs: a public key and a private key. They are related mathematically. You give out the public one, and you keep the private one very very secret.
* The private key cannot be derived from the public key without an amount of computation that would drain every star in the galaxy of its energy and take longer than the age of the universe to finish.
* What's encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key.
* What's encrypted with the private key can only be decrypted with the public key.
* A digital signature is made by taking a message (or anything, such as a Bitcoin transaction) and encrypting it (or a [hash]( of it) with a private key. Then other people can verify that signature by decrypting the message (or its hash) with the corresponding public key. If the decrypted message (or hash) matches the original message (or its hash), then the signature is valid. What "valid" means differs depending on how the digital signature is used, but in Bitcoin it means a transaction really did originate from the owner of the public/private key pair it claims to be from.
* A digital signature cannot be forged without an amount of computation that would drain every star in the galaxy of its energy and take longer than the age of the universe to finish.

Not sure what you mean by "unverified", but if the blockchain shows your address as the owner of the BTC, then your address owns them. If you never transfer those BTC, they'll sit where they are forever and lose their value to whoever gave them to you. If you transfer all other BTC out of that address, leaving only the mysteriously received BTC, you could then destroy the private key for that address, which destroys that BTC forever and prevents you from accidentally spending them in the future.

You don't need mining power to double spend. What you need is to propagate the double spend to more nodes faster than the original spend. If the double spend is in more nodes' mempools than the original spend, it prevents the original spend from spreading to those nodes and it has a higher chance of being mined first (which really helps lock out the original spend).

It can be, but usually the seller's BTC are escrowed by LocalBitcoins and released to the buyer's online wallet when the seller marks the sale paid.

Your seed provides the ability to generate all of your private keys (and their public keys) at a later time.

No, he DOESN'T "think he has the money". Why would he? There is no transaction in the blockchain saying he has the money.

The output of 0.00479999 BTC is simply one output of a TX that also has an output of 1 Satoshi, which is dust. That dust output is preventing the entire TX from being confirmed. My statement stands, unless you can give another reason why that TX is not being confirmed.
The fact that you were able to get the second TX confirmed 10 hours later just means the first TX didn't exist any any nodes' mempools long enough (or at all due to dust output?) to be rejected as a double spend. This is similar to the case where someone fails to include a fee with a TX and finds it unconfirmed 2 days later. They simply send the funds again in a new TX with a fee, and it gets confirmed, because all nodes have long forgotten about the feeless TX that they ignored.

I see your point, however in a very real sense "the Bitcoin protocol" _is_ the Bitcoin software. For instance, no coinbase output (the 25 BTC earned by miners) can be spent until it is 100 blocks deep in the blockchain. That's not in Satoshi's paper. It's enforced by the software. Is it part of the protocol? Yes, because if one miner modified his code to try to spend it early, no other node would accept the transaction. The protocol is the consensus, and the consensus is enforced by the software.

It's hard to deduce strict timing from the timestamps in blocks. Block timestamps are generated by the miners, and they do not need to synchronize their clocks. The protocol allows block times to be off by a few hours (not sure of the actual amount, but I want to say it's less than 4 or 5 hours).

No. You visit the phishing site (by mistake). They ask you for your username. You enter it. While they generate the next page, their *server* feeds your username to the real site, and scrapes the image and phrase from its response to them. They put that image and phrase into the page they send you. You think you're at the right site.
The only secure way to avoid this is to check the SSL cert, which your browser does for you *but* you have to read the URL and verify that it is correct. After all, the phishing site can use SSL too, and your browser will say their cert is valid.

The question at hand is: How does someone know the customer payed? The answer is: They know because they saw the transaction propagate across the network. A separate question is: What prevents those coins from being double-spent? To which the answer is: Confirmations in the blockchain prevent double-spends (although we know that most miners will reject a double-spend if they have already seen the earlier transaction even when there are zero confirmations).

blockchain.info wallet private keys are not known to blockchain.info, because they are generated locally in the browser using Javascript. Although you are not at risk from blockchain.info, you are at risk from any malware that was in your browser at the time you generated the private key(s).  If you did it while booted from a live CD, you probably have no malware. If you did have malware, it probably won't survive the next boot (but you do have a hard drive in the machine, so that's not a guarantee either. :-). One option is to never put that machine online ever again (or wipe the entire drive before doing so).

Good summary. More precisely, the reward is 25 BTC (called the "coinbase") + all the unspent inputs from every other transaction. Typically, this is just the fees included by wallet software, but ... if you manually create a transaction and mistakenly fail to spend, say, 1 BTC of the inputs, you are basically including a 1 BTC fee.

If Blockchain.info wants to solve this problem once and for all, they need to turn off the HTTP version of their site and change it to a static page telling people to manually type the HTTPS URL into their browser's address bar. No clickable link, because a malicious Tor exit node can tamper with it. No 302 redirect from HTTP to HTTPS, because a malicious Tor exit node can simply drop the redirect, leaving the browser looking at the HTTP site while the exit node MITMs all traffic to the HTTPS site. The browser will raise no red flags, and it's up the user to notice he's not at the secure site.

You're using the words wrong. By definition, a transaction makes it into the blockchain when it gets its first confirmation, which is the first block that contains the transaction. So it's not possible that your TX "made it into the Blockchain" but "never had any confirmations". It sounds like your transactions had _zero_ confirmations, which is why you still own the BTC.

[Bitstamp]( uses TLS/SSL for their Web access. Are you claiming that SSL is not sufficient to defeat a MITM attack? Yes, corporations use SSL interceptors against their employees, but that requires the company to install their MITM SSL cert on the machine to work. Assuming this wasn't the case, why is SSL not sufficient?


I agree with this on principle.

Seconded. Just be sure you never give anyone the Master Public Key and one private key (e.g., in a paper wallet as a gift), because that enables them to derive all the other private keys. See section *An Understated Problem* in this good article on HD wallets:

@_date: 2014-03-01 19:51:51


Right. And the way to calculate an address and compare it to the address being brute-forced is to execute this algorithm:
    for (privatekey in 0..(2^256)-1)
    {
      publickey = ElipticCurve(privatekey);
      address = SHA160(SHA256(publickey);
      if (address == address_being_brute_forced)
        return SUCCESS;
    }
That loop might iterate 2^256 times.
@_date: 2014-11-23 04:04:04
And if the act of creating the irrevocable forwarding had a protocol-enforced cost associated with it (say, a proof of work or proof of burn) then it would prevent a flood of preemptive forwards for trillions of addresses. And it would prevent a lot of blockchain bloat, since the forwards would very likely be published there.

I suspect they are visiting the HTTP site, which sends a "302 Found" redirect to the HTTPS site, but it's possible for a malicious Tor exit node to simply drop the redirect, leaving the browser at what it thinks is the HTTP site while the exit node MITMs all traffic to the HTTPS site. The browser gives no warnings, and it's up to the user to notice he's not at the secure site (when he never went there to begin with). I'm not aware of any hard evidence that this is happening, but it's a viable vector.
Not sure what Blockchain.info can do to shut this down completely, other than turn their HTTP site into a static page saying to manually enter the HTTPS URL into the browser address bar.

When an address is used as an input to a transaction, it completely consumes the BTC "stored" in that address, leaving the address with a "balance" of zero. Anyone who sees that transaction (i.e., everyone) also sees the public key of that address, so if ECDSA is broken they can compute the private key from that public key, but they will not get access to any BTC _unless_ the address is later re-used to receive BTC.
This is not the primary reason to avoid re-use, but it's a good one.

Nothing needs to be "returned". Until a transaction is confirmed, the BTC have not *left* the sender's address. Your wallet shows you the unconfirmed transaction because it's trying to show you the complete picture of what it knows about your addresses.

So it is possible then for law enforcement to take a Freenode host and, by enumerating all keys, decrypt the data stored on that host. This doesn't seem like a risk many people would be willing to take, especially given that the owner of the node has no control over the encrypted data stored on it.
BTW, isn't it possible to store data on Freenode using a key that is kept private (or only closely shared with few others)?

If your BTC are sufficiently old, the mining algorithm will accept the transaction without fees, even for small amounts. Don't have a link to the age-compensation algorithm at hand. If I find it, I'll update.
UPDATE: From  "[...] for each input, the [bitcoin-qt] client calculates the value of the input in BTC multiplied by the age of the input in blocks. It sums these products over all inputs and divides the total by the size of the transaction in bytes. If this gives a number less than 0.576 then the transaction requires a fee."

The browser will notice that it was expecting an HTTPS connection but got an HTTP connection and will complain. The user doesn't have notice anything (except, of course, his browser complaining). Are there any browsers that fail to report this case?
And the exit node can't present an HTTPS connection to the browser, because it can't present a valid SSL cert for blockchain.info, so if it tries that, the browser will again complain.
EDIT: But ... if the user first visits  an exit node can intercept (and drop) the HTTP redirect to  leaving the browser with an HTTP connection. The exit node then connects to the HTTPS server and MITMs everything else. Yeah, that works.

I agree that certain hash algorithms can be made more efficient than their naive implementation in C/C++.

Considering that it currently takes an average of 26,284,424,481,772,169,733 (26.2 quintillion) hashes to solve a block (distributed over thousands of miners, of course), a 10x performance increase is hardly a significant security issue for Bitcoin.

xor is not reversible. This can be deduced simply from the fact that it takes two bits of input and produces only one bit of output (i.e., it destroys information). If that weren't enough, what it actually does with the inputs is mathematically irreversible.

@_date: 2014-04-06 19:56:25
OK, it's astronomically difficult to find an input that hashes to a given output. That's not reversing the function. I think of "reversing" to be creating a 2nd function that takes the output of the hash function as input and produces the input to the hash function. This is impossible, because hash functions repeatedly XOR the input data, and XOR is irreversible.

"[...] simply recycled back into fiat"? You make it sound like the Bitcoins disappear when they are  converted for fiat by Overstock (I realize you know they don't — it just sounds like that). In fact, those BTC did something that most haven't done in years: they changed ownership. If Overstock exchanges them for fiat after you buy something from Overstock, then they changed ownership twice! These are not bad things.

This appears to be a hashing efficiency improvement, although I take issue with this statement:


The nonce is only 32 bits wide, and thus is too small be to be *only* free variable when mining a block. After all 2^32 nonces have been tried, the miner modifies the block in some way (e.g., the timestamp, adds a transaction, etc.), and starts all over again with every possible nonce.

The fee is per-transaction. If you gather all your coins that you want to move into one transaction, the fee will clearly be tiny compared to the amount you want to move. If it isn't, then why are you transacting such small amounts (i.e., less than 1 USD)? Also, don't forget that if your BTC are old enough, they can be transacted with zero fees.

Someone is raining tiny deposits down on thousands upon thousands of addresses, presumably in an attempt to more easily map the transaction graph (i.e., remove anonymity from the transactions).

Well, once a TX drops from every node's mempool, it's not coming back. This happens sometimes with low priority feeless TXs. The funds are never transferred, and the sender must literally force their client to resend the TX, which may involve overriding the anti-double-spend functionality in the client, since the client remembers having sent those funds before.

I don't buy it. SHA-256 is a cryptographically-strong hash function. If one bit of input is changed, on average half of the output bits flip, and the bits that flip are effectively random (i.e., unpredictable). Nothing in the selection of transactions or anything else in the data being hashed will help find hashes lower than the current target.
EDIT: On top of that, a block hash is the result of a double SHA-256 hash: the output of the first hash is hashed. This makes predicting or controlling the final hash value virtually impossible.

Use a passphrase that's 50 letters long and you have 50 * 1.3 = 65 bits of entropy, which is reasonably strong (though not beyond the abilities of state actors to brute force). If you need protection from them, make it 100 characters long (or more).
But don't use a well known phrase. For instance, don't use "It was the best of times. It was the worst of times." or "Four score and seven years ago, our forefathers brought forth on this continent". Those are in dictionaries of common attacks.

There is no way the kinds of small day-to-day forks that happen from mining require a [coinbase transaction]( to be 100 blocks deep before the BTC are considered "real". Maybe the [March 2013 fork]( would have been an issue, but that only happened once. You can't use "spending immature coins" (where "immature" = "created by a coinbase TX less than 100 blocks deep") as a reason for any of MtGox's problems.

I suppose two of the more obvious ways to "crack" Bitcoin are to either:
1. Find a way to make easy collisions with SHA256. This would allow forged blocks into the blockchain, paying the block reward to the forger.
1. Find a way to map an Elliptic Curve public key to a private key. This would allow outright theft of coins.

Each number is output on a line by itself, which allows the `tac` command to reverse them (`tac` is a backward `cat` command: it copies standard input to standard output, like `cat`, but reverses the lines before outputing them).

Not necessarily. If the TX drops from the mempool of all nodes and miners, it won't come back, and it will never be mined. If it hasn't been mined in 3 or 4 days, that's probably what happened.

On a first-come-first-serve basis, people and organizations could digitally sign (using a Bitcoin private key) a standardized "statement" that a given email address, **E**, maps to a Bitcoin address, **A**, corresponding to the private key used to sign the statement. This statement could be put into the blockchain to make it immutable. Wallet software could lookup these email-to-address mappings either in the blockchain (unwieldy, probably won't be implemented widely) or from a centralized server (that would be audited against the blockchain for correctness — trust/reputation would be involved here ... ugh).
Downside  Bad actors could DoS the system by spamming the blockchain with mappings from other people's email addresses to the bad actors' Bitcoin addresses. This can be countered by people specifying an email address that is not real (and thus unpredictable): joesmith123

That last bit "if you publicize you own a particular address" is the rub. Since the blockchain is public, sufficient computing power can map the known owner of some BTC at time T to the downstream owners at time T+N, as long as the downstream owners spend the coins or convert them to fiat in a manner that reveals the owner's identity. Once an address is associated with a person, all past and future use of that address is exposed. This will always be possible until some sort of [Zero Knowledge Proof]( algorithm (as in the [ZeroCoin]( proposal) is implemented to disconnect the source and destination addresses of a transaction.

Yes, where "knows" means "is the immutable digital representation of".


The miners don't exactly move the Bitcoins. They produce a [block]( which contains the transaction. The transaction is [digitally signed]( with one of your private keys to prove that it came from one of your addresses (this prevents other people from forging transactions that access your Bitcoins). That block is appended to the [blockchain]( because it contains the hash of the then-newest block. When some other miner generates a newer block that contains the hash of your block, the blockchain grows ever longer.
A public consensus forms as the blockchain grows, with each new block making it exponentially harder for older blocks to be eliminated by a competing fork of the blockchain. The rule is: the longest blockchain is the truth, because we assume a majority of the miners' computing power is controlled by honest miners who are not trying to subvert the blockchain. As long that that is true, the longest blockchain can be believed to represent the true ownership of all Bitcoins.


The transaction propagates quickly to nearly all miners in the peer-to-peer network. It's very efficient (which is why a vendor might let you walk away with that cup of coffee if they simply see the transaction on the p2p network even if it's not yet in the blockchain). A confirmation is any block newer than the one containing your transaction.  So your transaction will only appear in one block from one miner — the one who "wins" that block by performing the [proof-of-work]( computation and publishing it first. If 7 confirmations have happened, then 7 newer blocks have piled up on top of the block containing your transaction, but none of those newer blocks contain your transaction. Yet their existence in the blockchain makes it *very* unlikely that a competing fork of the blockchain will overtake the one containing your transaction, because re-doing the proof-of-work to create 8 different blocks (to replace the one with your transaction and the 7 on top of it) is astronomically difficult.
It is, in a word, ingenious.

A hard fork is, by definition, something that is *not* agreed upon. If there were consensus, there would be no fork.


If there is agreement (consensus), then there is no fork. If there is disagreement about how to evolve the protocol, a hard fork is possible, and potentially a new coin is born.

[Directory.io]( lists all private keys (and their associated public keys). A [private key]( is a 256 bit number in the range 1 to 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEBAAEDCE6AF48A03BBFD25E8CD0364141. There's a LOT of private keys. If your hypothetical JavaSript app could scan a trillion key-pairs every trillionth of a second, the Sun would burn out long before you scanned even a trillionth of all possible key-pairs.
That's the time-based argument against it being possible. There's an energy-based argument against it too: If your app required just a billionth of a trillionth of a watt of power to scan a trillion quadrillion key-pairs, there isn't enough energy in all the 100 billion suns in our galaxy to power the full scan.

You do not have an account. You have a *wallet*, which is a file on your hard disk. Your Bitcoin software may allow you to encrypt it, in which case you have a password that you must enter to decrypt your wallet. You should back up your wallet, because it contains your private keys, which allow you to spend your Bitcoins. If you lose your private keys, you lose your Bitcoins. Consider using [cold storage](
The only way to use your wallet on another device is to install MultiBit on that device and copy your wallet to it.

Bitcoin is inherently deflationary, so when no new Bitcoins are being mined (or very few new ones), the value of a fixed amount of BTC will forever increase. New units will have to be invented. A Satoshi is 1/100,000,000th of a BTC, so it's a fairly small amount of money now, but when a cup of coffee costs 0.000000000000000000001 BTC, one Satoshi might buy you a new car.

It shouldn't. Whether a transaction request comes in from a browser or the API, a new session needs to be created on the server-side, which should cause 2FA authentication to happen. A session can remain valid for some time, but eventually it should time out, leading to another 2FA interaction for the next session. The OP said he never used his API key, so there was no existing API-initiated session. This points to a session hijacking flaw on the server-side.

Double spending certainly gains the attacker money at the expense of someone else, but the attacker still has to spend BTC equal to the amount they want to steal. I suppose this could be used to buy things (e.g., buying two one million dollar yachts at the cost of just one million dollars). They could transfer the same N Bitcoins to two different exchanges and cash out of both, but exchanges operate so cautiously (i.e., slowly) that the double spend and blockchain fork would very likely be seen before at least one exchange lets the attacker cash out.
In the end, if that kind of 51% attack succeeded, the attacker's mining operation would be banned from the network and the remaining miners would pick one of the two forks to continue with. Everyone else's transactions would still be in one or the other fork.

The [nonce]( is a 32-bit (4 byte) field in each block. A miner increments the nonce by one just before each hash operation. If the hash value is less than the [target]( the block is "solved" and is appended to the blockchain.
At the current [difficulty]( (1180923195.258), it takes an average of 5072103896884509938 hashes to solve a block. Clearly, 32-bits is not big enough to represent all the possible nonces needed, so when the 32-bit nonce wraps back to zero, additional bits elsewhere in the block are incremented.

The unconfirmed transaction propagates across the peer-to-peer network almost immediately. The 10 minute figure you speak of is the rough time for the global network of miners to produce one new block. As blocks pile up after the block containing the transaction, the transaction becomes more and more confirmed. After 6 blocks appear following the one with the transaction, it becomes very unlikely that a fork in the chain will eliminate the transaction from the blockchain.

"listening to the network" means monitoring the peer-to-peer network for newly broadcast transactions. It only takes seconds for a transaction to spread across the world via the p2p network, though it takes longer for it to be *confirmed* by getting included in a block.

I can take a shot at explaining hashing, but I don't yet know enough about ECDSA to explain how it works. A hash function can be thought of as a one way "bit blender". If you put a fish in a real blender and press *puree* for a while, you end up with a bunch of goo that used to be a fish. There's no *unpuree* button you can press that will turn the goo back into the fish. Similarly, hash functions are irreversible.
A second nice feature of hash functions is that the same output bits come out when you put in the same input bits every time. Say you download a program from the Internet. The download page will often include the SHA-1 hash of the program file. This is so you can re-compute the hash yourself after downloading it to verify that you got what the author created (i.e., it wasn't corrupted or swapped for malware).
Another feature of a *cryptographically secure hash function* is very valuable: If you change just one bit in the input, on average half the bits in the output flip. This makes it astronomically improbable that two different inputs will hash to the same output, an event called a *hash collision*.
Lastly, the number that is output by a hash function is often 160, 256, or even 512 bits long. Those are *huge* numbers, which also makes the risk of hash collisions astronomically unlikely. To put it in perspective, there are about 2^252 atoms in the visible universe (a sphere ~90 billion light years in diameter). If you wanted to write down all 256-bit numbers, you couldn't do it, even if you could put each number on one atom, because there aren't enough atoms in the universe. It would take more than billions of trillions of times longer than the age of the universe just to count from 1 to 2^256, even if you could count one number every trillionth of a billionth of a second.

It's actually public keys that are either compressed or uncompressed (I've editted my above reply to reflect this). Private keys are always the same size and are associated with either a compressed public key or an uncompressed public key. When a private key associated with a compressed public key is encoded into WIF ([Wallet Import Format]( a marker byte (0x01) is appended to mark it as being associated with a compressed public key. That marker byte makes the WIF representation of the private key one character longer (and also start with 'L' or 'K').

Yes. All private keys are 256-bit numbers, but you'll never see that number. Instead, you'll see the WIF representation of the private key, and that always starts with a 5, L, or K.


Only in that they are compressed to save space. Although, because of how Elliptic Curve crypto works (and the math is waaay beyond me), if you were to uncompress a compressed public key, it would be associated with a *different* 256-bit private key than the compressed form is associated with. This is why the clients don't let users convert public keys between compressed and uncompressed form. If they allowed that, the private key saved in the wallet wouldn't match the converted public key. I assume that for future scalability of the p2p protocol, compressed public keys are preferred.

If you follow the best practice of never reusing an address, then each time you send Bitcoins to someone, your change comes back in a new address that is not in any of your backups. In that case, your backups become out-of-date every time you send money, but not if you receive money at an address in your backed up wallets.
All you are backing up are your private keys. Your addresses (which are basically hashes of your public keys) can be derived from your private keys.

But Bitcoins can be loaned, and Bitcoin debt can accrue, and Bitcoin bankruptcy can happen when creditors can't be repaid. We just won't have the Fed trying to game the system.

It sounds like you backed up your *private keys* to some location chosen by the app. You don't know where that location is. You don't know if they are encrypted. If encryption was used, you don't know how good it is. If you weren't asked for a passphrase when you did the backup, there is probably no encryption. None of this is a good thing.
I don't trust smartphone security enough to keep my private keys on a phone. You may want to use TrueCrypt, GnuPG, or PGP to encrypt your wallet on a computer (not smartphone) you control completely. Then backups are as simple as copying the TrueCrypt container file or the GnuPG/PGP-encrypted file.

A paper wallet is nothing more than your private keys printed on paper and stored in a secure location. Bells and whistles can be added, such as printing a private key as a QR code. See  for details. If you want to spend the bitcoins associated with those private keys, you have to import them into a software wallet to send the bitcoins to other addresses.

Until the transaction is in the blockchain with a few confirmation blocks on top of it (where "few" means up to 6 or so, depending on who you ask), the Bitcoins can't be considered "transferred", because a competing fork lacking that transaction might overtake those blocks. The more confirmations, the less likely a competing fork can overtake the last N blocks (I think Satoshi's paper showed that 6 confirmations makes it astronomically unlikely of a competing fork overtaking the last 6 blocks). That's why nobody will let have what you buy until they at least see the transaction on the peer-to-peer network and maybe even see 1 or several blocks confirming the transaction. A transaction is only *real* when it's in the blockchain and buried under several confirmation blocks.


No difference at all. Consider a valid (i.e., non-fraudulent) transaction send into the network without any fee. It could take hours for a miner to include it into a block, because it has no fee. During that time, the BTC has not moved anywhere. The blockchain is the definition of which addresses own which Bitcoins. Until a transaction is the blockchain, it literally doesn't matter to anyone, especially the recipient of the BTC in that transaction. Now some people will accept simply seeing the transaction on the peer-to-peer network and take it on good faith that the BTC will eventually appear in the blockchain, but you can't buy a car that way, only a cup of coffee.

What said, plus ... confirmation blocks make it harder and harder (exponentially) for a blockchain fork to overtake the blockchain that contains your transaction.

Bitcoin's great advance is that  it's a workable trust-free means of payment. In the end, the protocol is executed correctly only because there is a consensus among nodes that they will do it that way. In many decades, if a consensus were to form that we want new coins to continue to be created past the ~21,000,000 built into the protocol, then the protocol could be changed. A consensus is ultimately about people, and with people comes all the baggage people carry.

There is the risk (for banks, not for people) that they will only be providing services like private key storage. Without a "Bitcoin Federal Reserve" printing free Bitcoins and making free loans to large banks, it's hard for the smaller banks to make Bitcoin loans. Yes, if a bank owns N BTC it can loan N/2 BTC, but then it literally has only half of its Bitcoins left. Dollars are loaned by conjuring them from thin air (via the Fed).

Possibly, but we're talking about decades in the future.

Perhaps the two biggest misconceptions in the press about Bitcoin is that it's anonymous (like cash) and mostly used for criminal activity. Every Bitcoin transaction is recorded in a global shared immutable public ledger called the [*blockchain*]( With sufficient computing power (think of your favorite Three Letter Agency :), the graph of every payment into and out of Bitcoin can be traced to real person. It is anything but anonymous in its current incarnation. But it may not stay that way, because work is ongoing to create [truly anonymous Bitcoin transactions](
Yes, it's used for criminal activity, but so is cash. The key is that as Bitcoin becomes more widespread, the criminal activity will be swamped by the legitimate uses.
Bitcoin is decentralized by its nature. Nobody controls it. The software is open source and the protocols are published and analysed by cryptography experts. You don't need a bank or a government to tell you if you can spend your bitcoins or to whom you can transfer them. It's the currency of the Internet, and it transcends governments.

Yes. If you import your [private keys]( into a new wallet, it will let you access the associated Bitcoins. Obviously, this makes private keys something that should be kept very secret and protected against loss/destruction. Consider using [cold storage]( for long-term private key protection.


Your private key proves that you own the BTC associated with a given [address]( (thanks to the [Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm]( Your private key is mathematically related to your public key (from which an address is derived) in such a way that transactions signed with your private key can be verified to have been made by you using only the public key. The [blockchain]( is a decentralized immutable public ledger of all digitally-signed Bitcoin transactions sent between public keys. The job of a Bitcoin [wallet]( (MultiBit, Electrum, Armory, Bitcoin-qt, etc.) is to manage your private/public key-pairs and allow you to access the associated BTC.

A *field* is a memory location that holds a number (in this case the nonce). The mining software/hardware adds 1 to the nonce before each hash attempt.

is correct. Additionally, miners watch for publication of new blocks on the p2p network. If you've been hashing on a candidate block for, say, 5 minutes (billions and billions of hashes), and you see the next solved block come from another miner, you must throw away the block you've been trying to solve, create a new one from available unconfirmed transactions, and start hashing from scratch. The reason is that each block contains the hash of the previous block in the blockchain. Once a newer block is appended to the blockchain, all ongoing hashing must start over with a different block that references the *new* newest block.

No. The value that a block hash must be below is the *target* not the *difficulty*. The current target is 0000000000000004BA6E00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 and can be obtained from

Presently, that ratio (the difficulty) is 908350862.43702.
@_date: 2013-12-27 06:21:25


No. A new block is solved by exactly one miner's computer when it computes a hash that is less than the target. That block contains the transactions that miner decided to include. That block is then broadcast across the p2p network. If two miners solve two different blocks at nearly the same time and both are broadcast at nearly the same time, there is briefly a blockchain fork. This is not uncommon. Eventually, more miners begin building on one rather the other fork, and it grows longer. The longest blockchain is always the true blockchain, by consensus.


The software includes only unconfirmed transactions in a new block, with a bias towards those that pay fees. At any given time, thousands and thousands of miners are all hashing away at different blocks, but only one will be the *next* block in the longest blockchain.

1. If you have a passphrase on your wallet, type: **walletpassphrase "YOURPASSPHRASE" 600** — this will unlock your wallet for 600 seconds (10 minutes). I believe the quotes are required (but I don't know because I don't use bitcoin-qt to encrypt my wallet)
1. Type: **dumpprivkey YOURPUBLICKEY** — your public key is displayed in the bitcoin-qt GUI. A public key is called an *address* in the GUI. It looks like this: 1MJAG5jbAWF5gpwHsqyCqFzg71SfEpweL1 (that's not yours, just one I copied out of the blockchain).
1. If you have a passphrase on your wallet, type: **walletlock** — this will lock your wallet.
That will display the private key for that public key (i.e., Bitcoin address). It will look like this sample private key taken from the Bitcoin wiki: **5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF** — again yours will be different, but it will start with a '5', an 'L', or a 'K' and be about that long.
*NEVER SHOW OR GIVE YOUR PRIVATE KEYS TO ANYONE!* Also, consider putting your private keys in [cold storage](
To import a private key into a new wallet, do this:
1. Launch bitcoin-qt using the new wallet. Typically, this is on a different computer than where the original wallet exists.
1. Repeat steps 1-4 from the above instructions on how to export a private key.
1. Type: **importprivkey YOURPRIVATEKEY**
1. If you have a passphrase on your wallet, type: **walletlock** — this will lock your wallet.
Hope this helps. BTW, none of this should be necessary. You should be able to simply copy your wallet.dat file between two computers each running a recent version of bitcoin-qt. I don't know why that doesn't work for you.

Bitcoins are *exchangeable* for fiat not backed by it. If Bitcoin can even be said to be "backed by" anything, it is by the consensus and proof-of-work of miners.

You misunderstand just how big the number 2^160 is (and that's just the size of an address — a private key is a 256 bit number). I suggest you try to understand these truly BIG numbers. They dwarf your personal experience, your planet, your galaxy, and even your universe.

Can Multibit use bitcoin-qt wallet.dat files?
