If you want to play IRL, I've made [crypto-themed playing cards]( 
Let me know what you think!
@_date: 2019-07-14 09:38:03
[Any poker players here?](
@_date: 2019-07-11 06:45:00
Can I do a shameless plug? I've made crypto-themed playing cards! Worth checking out if you're a poker player! 
@_date: 2019-03-15 08:12:40
It's true that goodies such as my cards are not "essential"! I wouldn't necessarily call them junk though, but I see your point. I'm just trying to put the ideas of cryptos into the physical word through an existing market.
@_date: 2019-03-27 22:39:21
Imagine you want to buy a TV (200$). You can either spend your bitcoin and keep your fiat, or spend your fiat and keep your bitcoin. 
You can also spend your bitcoin and use the fiat (that you didn't spend since you used bitcoin to purchase the TV) to buy bitcoin.
Sure this makes you use your fiat to buy back the bitcoin you just spent. But this puts more fiat into btc, helps adoption and get more merchants to start accepting BTC 
@_date: 2019-03-02 23:49:44
What is the point of your comment?
@_date: 2019-03-30 15:44:35
It's right behind the ace, didn't come up properly on the video! 
@_date: 2019-03-08 11:14:53
You're awesome! I should be able to ship them today! Was the check-out process smooth when using BTC?
@_date: 2019-03-28 10:20:17
What do you think of this one? 
@_date: 2019-03-22 18:27:58
You seem to know your stuff. Can you tell me how and if DAI is different?
@_date: 2019-03-19 05:59:07


Well, you look like a fun guy.
@_date: 2019-03-28 15:40:25
Your feedback is awesome! I've dmed you to chat more, if it's okay with you.
@_date: 2019-03-15 07:42:40
Thank you for the kind words! Very small step towards adoption but if I can get even one person to dive into cryptos, after playing with those cards, that's already a win! ��
@_date: 2019-03-08 11:14:21
Sorry, I should definitely switch the main currency to USD. I live in Switzerland, that's why I put CHF as the main currency!
Great that you found the pictures! The 12 figures (J, Q, K of each suit) were made by super talented artists from all over the world. You can find their names and website on the footer of the website!
@_date: 2019-03-19 05:58:17
Fully digital transaction, no chargeback, no disproportionate fees, "anonymous", no fiat.
@_date: 2019-03-19 17:32:37
Absolutely and utterly false. You retain every right you have as a consumer, no matter how you pay and which medium you used to do so. 
Now, sure, it might me more difficult to assert your rights when the merchant is on the other side of the world and when it's a small amount of money.
This is where reputation comes into place, the same way it always has. It has two main functions: firstly, you, as a consumer, have access to the seller's rating and other customers previous experiences. This will allow you to avoid bad sellers. Secondly, the seller will want to preserve its reputation and keep a positive rating, and help you, if anything is wrong with your order, because they know they'll lose sales if you leave bad ratings.

I will look into it!
@_date: 2019-03-08 11:59:05
Didn't think of that! The currency switcher is configured to keep a "pretty" price ending in .99, explaining the variations I suppose. 
@_date: 2019-03-10 22:01:13
Question, without LN, how does it work? Do you have to stick around until the transaction is confirmed? How many confirmations would be enough for the merchant? 
@_date: 2019-03-08 14:10:32
Problem is that you need 4 suits in an ordinary deck (spade, heart, club, diamond). Not sure how a Bitcoin only set would work with playing cards..?
@_date: 2019-03-22 20:18:32
If they know there's an expiration date, they will have to learn the basics and move the funds. In any case, they should do it asap. Expiration date provides an incentive to learn the ropes and understand how it works. If they want to hodl after that on their own wallet, they're 100% fee to do so!
@_date: 2019-03-08 14:12:08
Currently, because I accept many other cryptocurrencies. But that's a great idea, I could definitely try to see if a plugin allows me to add a "Sat button" to display prices in satoshis!

I made some crypto-themed playing cards to spread awareness about cryptocurrencies in the general population. Check them out [here!](
@_date: 2019-03-15 06:41:00
The idea is to spread awareness of cryptocurrencies through an already existing, well established and usable market (poker, blackjack, magic, etc.). 
You can order them [here]( and I offer worldwide free shipping.
@_date: 2019-03-19 19:43:25
You know you're the one who ends up paying for the credit card fees in the end. Merchant *is* going to pass those costs onto you. All you did was keep people who paid with cash (and potentially cryptos) from getting a discount.
@_date: 2019-03-08 05:21:04
You are definitely not a merchant. 
@_date: 2019-03-22 20:27:23
I've personally never done it! But that's what I inferred from the original comment ("*I put an expiry on them*").
@_date: 2019-03-20 07:30:05
Just wanted to let you know guys that I've got way too many [Bitcoin is King t-shirts]( Open to any price suggestion! 
@_date: 2019-03-30 17:58:41

Shameless plug, but I just wanted to let you guys know that I'm currently offering [10% discount exclusively when using Bitcoin]( to purchase my Crypto Playing Cards, [here](
@_date: 2019-03-02 23:48:06
Honestly, as a merchant of a inexpensive product, fees are absolutely killing me. When customers pay with PayPal, I usually have to pay between 2 and 8% fees (fixed fee, variable fee, currency conversion fee). Since I'm running on almost non-existing margins, this is super problematic. But wait, it gets worse. 
I also do dropshipping. When one of my resellers sells my product, they get a PayPal/credit card fee. And when they send me the money, I have to pay again for the PayPal/credit card fee. 
That's why I just love getting paid with cryptos. No fees and I can turn it into dollars pretty much instantly and with a super low trading fee (0.2%).
Commercializing a product really made me realise how huge the potential of cryptos is. 
@_date: 2019-03-15 13:31:09
I think that [one retailer actually does]( but only for US customers! Personally, I don't have sufficient margins to afford the monthly fees to list on Amazon :(
@_date: 2019-03-11 08:36:13


Can you elaborate?


Not really worried about double spending. But what if the transaction doesn't get confirmed because the fees are too low? And the merchant only sees that a few days after?
@_date: 2019-03-02 23:39:11
Can't believe you're getting downvoted since you're completely right. Log scale would make it look much less imaginable. 
@_date: 2019-03-16 00:14:22
So the merchant accepted an unconfirmed transaction? Or did you stick around until the first confirmation?
@_date: 2019-03-02 23:52:37
Just look at the Y axis ffs. If it was an actual logarithmic scale, 1 million would be pretty much 1 or 2 meters above your screen.
@_date: 2019-03-02 18:30:44
Lmfao at why this post is getting upvoted. Look at the Y axis. The real curve to one million with a proportionate Y axis would look much different.
@_date: 2019-03-08 14:15:02
Haha true! 
I thought, there are so many different cryptocurrencies out there, I could use four of them that have slightly different "universes". Colors were also very important: for example, Monero could have had awesome characters, but it's orange and I didn't want it to conflict with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-03-08 08:59:07
I made crypto-themed playing cards to spread awareness about cryptos through an existing and usable market (poker, blackjack and other card games). Spade, heart, club and diamond have been replaced with Bicoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and NEO.
You can get the game [here]( and the 10% discount will be automatically applied when you choose to checkout with Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-03-28 13:34:16
Sorry that you don't like it man! It's the design created to represent the jack of bitcoin in poker playing cards.

Come on... The guy painted a beautiful street art about banks killing the people. He's doing something to help adoption and spread awareness. What are you doing other than criticizing his work?
@_date: 2019-02-01 05:36:24
I feel you man. I'm in the same spot right now with my product.
@_date: 2019-02-03 13:51:03
* Transfer fees
* Time for a transaction to confirm
"But LN fixes all this!!!" Then...
* Viability of LN for multiple everyday purchases in shops you only shop once.

Thanks for the nice insights. I'm absolutely convinced about Bitcoin's worth as a store of value, but still on the fence regarding it's role as a mean of exchange. That's why I also dig Nano but definitely looking forward to how LN's going to spread and how viable and usable it's going to be!
@_date: 2019-02-03 14:16:56
Another concern I'm thinking of:
* Power and role of miners 
@_date: 2019-02-01 11:48:12
Gold has a bit more than 7 trillions. Is that too far fetched to believe that Bitcoin might reach that, and maybe go higher? Once people realise it's actually even better than gold, and is much harder money?
@_date: 2019-02-01 11:46:05
So true. I'm trying to set up my e-shop (selling crypto-themed playing cards) so that paying with cryptos gives you a discount. I'm almost there!
@_date: 2019-02-21 18:31:29
I hope it won't come across as useless spamming but I thought this T-shirt was really cool and would love to spread it around. [It costs $19.99]( with $3 of shipping on top.  The design of the King is the design used in my deck of crypto-themed playing cards.

My website!
@_date: 2019-04-09 17:29:47
As I've said, I'm not going to waste time justifying my beliefs in the blockchain to you. I know why I believe in it and I know why I'm trying to get more people onboard. I've even made crypto-themed playing cards to spread awareness in the general population.
You shouldn't assume things from other people, without knowing anything about them. If you believe that I'm into cryptos just because it's "the how new thing", then carry on, my wayward son. I know what and why I'm fighting for.
@_date: 2019-04-04 05:22:20
I do! :)
@_date: 2019-04-26 11:38:18


So simple, yet so many people fail to realise it's the perfect way to 1) help adoption, 2) avoid being the $2 millions pizza guy, 3) get more fiat into the crypto ecosystem.
@_date: 2019-04-05 16:06:41
Curious. How can you fraud the system with 0 confs? By choosing way too low fees? Do the usual wallets even allow insufficient fees to be chosen? 
@_date: 2019-04-26 20:13:49
Are you a merchant? Do you sell anything online?
I've commercialised a crypto-related product (as you can see from my username) and when someone from the US purchase my product ($14.99) through PayPal, I pay 8% fees ($1.20). That's outrageous.
I much prefer to receive crypto, which is basically free. I like to hold the cryptos I get and use them whenever I can to purchase stuff. If I need to convert it back to fiat (to pay for shipping for example), it costs me like 0.5% in fees on any platform exchange (16* less).
Merchants can and do benefit from cryptocurrencies, and doesn't *have to* hodl.
@_date: 2019-04-04 05:42:43
Wow, that's looking great! Did you paint that?
Makes me think about the [King of Bitcoin]( I commissioned for my crypto playing cards.

You're awesome :) Hit me up if you encounter any trouble on the [website](
@_date: 2019-04-16 17:55:29
Unfortunately I don't, had to chose 4 different cryptos based on colours, atmospheres and characteristics, to give a feel of the diversity of cryptocurrencies to the general population.
The four suits are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Neo.
@_date: 2019-04-17 11:45:22
Thanks! Yes, I worked with super talented artists from all over the world (you can check them out in the footer of my website). All the art was specially made for the game, and tries, to some extent, to represent the cryptocurrencies they stand for. E.g. Bitcoin is the first and oldest cryptocurrency, the safest and most secure so the characters are medieval and powerful.
@_date: 2019-04-26 14:33:55
I have no idea! I figured I'd just print the games and then try to commercialize it but it's tough to do for a single individual.
@_date: 2019-04-08 16:21:58


How about a non-technical *user*? And I think it'd be great to explain to those non-technical users why the block size shouldn't be increased, in layman's terms. Because obviously, when new users start coming in, they WILL ask questions about why you have to pay fees and why it's not instant, like some other cryptocurrencies are. 
@_date: 2019-04-26 14:10:28
Thanks man! 
Well basically, it was before Christmas 2017, I wanted to find a cool little crypto-related gift that I could give to my relatives and friends. I looked for goodies online but I couldn't find anything actually "useful", in the sense that they could actually use in their every day life. 
Some of my friends like to play poker, and some of my older relatives like to play cards sometimes. I thought that it was a fun way for cryptos to "infiltrate" the physical world. I chose 4 cryptos that have different features, colors and origins, to get a preview of the crypto ecosystem.
I also wanted the product to look and feel good in hand, since it would be sort of the first impression of cryptos for some people. Also wanted some custom art to really give some dimensions and differentiate the four suits.
Still trying to get the game in big stores but I suck at marketing :(
@_date: 2019-04-09 08:40:50
Correct me if I'm wrong but you don't need to download the whole blockchain to be considered a user, aka someone who *uses* the blockchain.
@_date: 2019-04-09 15:13:03
That is a weird argument. I don't think you need to download and verify the blockchain to call yourself a user. ~~A~~
It's the fact that you *can* do download and verify it, if you want to, that is essential. Like science: you don't need to go look into every book and every experiment to verify certain theories (evolution, gravity, etc.); it's  the fact that, if you were to actually do it, you'd be able to.
I'm a huge blockchain believer, because of the transparency and decentralization it offers. I honestly don't feel this convo is going anywhere, so I don't feel I have to justify to you why I use and believe in the blockchain. Also, I'm a merchant and I actually despise paypal, because I'm the one who has to pay 8% fees on some transactions.
edit: spelling
@_date: 2019-04-30 20:10:51
Can someone Eli5 how it can do that without the user losing control over their coins? 
At some point, the coins have to leave your public address, right? What guarantees that you can get them back?
@_date: 2019-04-17 08:44:50
Didn't want to spam the subreddit but if anyone's interested, I'm still trying to dispatch my [crypto-themed playing cards]( 
The idea is to get the general population acquainted with bitcoin and cryptocurrencies through old and familiar games (poker, blackjack, etc.).
Here's the [Bitcoin suit]( for the most curious! Three other suits are Ethereum, Litecoin and NEO. Choice was made with regards to colors, age, shape of the logo, legal compliance, etc.

I apologise for posting a few times here, it's very hard to get in touch with the community. It was a fun little project to work on, to help get more people acquainted with cryptocurrencies. I've reduced the price to [$11.99]( with free international shipping if anyone's interested.

Shameless plug, but I've created [Crypto-themed playing cards]( to help spread awareness about Bitcoin and cryptos through traditionnal games (poker, blackjack, etc.). 
I think it's a nice (and actually usable/useful) gift for your family, friends or colleagues. It'll help get more people acquainted when they start asking questions.
@_date: 2019-04-26 11:36:14


Great idea! I've created [Crypto-themed playing cards]( so that people (and especially no-coiners) can play any card games while getting acquainted with bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

Haha thanks very much! Get some Swiss chocolate on top! 
@_date: 2019-04-09 17:34:39


I can. I just don't want to with you ;)
@_date: 2019-04-27 07:42:03
You calculate "**its**" value with fiat money. Sure, 1 bitcoin might be worth $5k, and then $4.9k, and then $5.1k. If you were to use the Venezuelan Bolivar as reference, you would also think bitcoin gained a lot of value, where in reality it's the Bolivar that lost value.
The value you're referring to ($ I guess) is one value. When you think about it, one bitcoin will always be one bitcoin, as in 1/21'000'000 of every bitcoin ever created. 
You're not diluted and you don't suffer from inflation, no matter how long the transfer takes.
But I get your point though. Volatility in fiat value is still a problem, but it tends to be the case for every new asset. With time and adoption, its stability will get better I believe.
@_date: 2019-04-04 05:23:02

Why so mean? I created this "shitty product" because I wanted to help spread awareness of cryptocurrencies in the general population. 
If you don't like it, it's fine, but I don't see why you have to be so dismissive. I'm trying to do something to help adoption, even if it's not much.

Cool website man. I've developed a deck of crypto-themed playing cards, would you be interested in selling it on your website?
@_date: 2019-01-12 02:55:44
I see where you're coming from. The idea behind the deck is to spread awareness about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Most people know Bitcoin and nothing else, and all they know about Bitcoin is that its price changes a lot.
We need people to understand that Bitcoin and the blockchain technology introduced something new and revolutionary, and that multiples other cryptocurrencies exist, and that it might completely change the way they consider means of exchange and store of value.
@_date: 2019-01-17 09:35:42

Woah, you sound terribly ignorant on the matter and very sheltered; it's incredible to witness such a lack of knowledge, imagination, empathy, and quite honestly close-mindedness. You're essentially unable to grasp why all those points might be relevant and useful, maybe even vital, for a lot of people.
From what I see, you never really had to deal with any of those problems, which do exist. 
I bet you never had to pay taxes to a government that decides to unfairly tax some of his citizens (e.g. because of their ethnicity, their gender, etc.), that arbitrarily decides to freeze your asset because they consider you to be disruptive to the regime, or that is plagued by corruption.
I bet you never had to pay for a good/service that was prohibited by the Government and where the bank would closely monitor your activity and report you if you did anything "wrong".
I bet you never commercially sold anything to anyone and that you never had to deal with scrounges who get to keep your product and your product after they manage to reverse the transaction. I bet you never had money taken away from you by the bank, just because they can and have a "valid reason" to do so.
I bet you never realised that your fiat money that you're so proud of, actually loses value every night, due to inflation. Monetary mass is created out of nothing, by the banking system and the national banks. It's a fact. If you own 1 bitcoin, you own 1/21'000'000 of the bitcoins that exist. After one day, one month of 10 years, your bitcoin will always be 1/21'000'000. 
I bet you never lived in a country where traditional investment was reserved for richer people than you. Where people like you were not worth of investing their meager salary into anything else than rent.
I bet you never realised that every transaction you claim to do for free has to be paid by someone. If it's not by you, don't worry, it's still you. The merchants have to pay A LOT of money to accept digital transactions and credit cards machines. And they will pass these costs onto the customers. I bet you never lived in a country where you have to pay 50$/year fees just to be able to have a bank account, which is probably surprising to you but is very common
I bet you never had to do any cross-borders transaction, because if you did, you'd know it takes days, even weeks, and actually costs a lot of money. And guess what, sometimes the banks actually lose the money and have to search for it during days/weeks.
All in all, I think you know nothing about the matter, because you always lived *your* life. You never realised that those problems were there, because you never encountered them. So for you, if you don't experience those problems, then they don't exist. 
Have more imagination, have more empathy, have more knowledge.

I meant an e-shop which it obviously isn't. They probably handle mostly cash so crypto aren't less secure.
@_date: 2019-01-21 20:59:16
Included in the price are also the international shipping costs who are super high when shipping from Switzerland.

Sorry you find this ugly :( I made the game to spread awareness in the general population through an already existing and usable market. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 22:00:00
Why do you think I'm trying to sell you bitcoin? Honestly? I don't care about public interest, I'm just telling you why OP had very valid points and that you dismissing them like you did was not fair nor or accurate, but pretty dismissive and ignorant.
@_date: 2019-01-17 09:45:04
Just wanted to let the bitcoin community that my [crypto-themed playing cards]( featuring bitcoin are currently on promotion and worldwide free shipping. There's also a cool "Bitcoin is King" t-shirt on promotion.
@_date: 2019-01-14 22:33:52
Yes! YES! That's exactly what I feel is the first step towards general adoption! My crypto-themed cards are exactly in this vein, but your way is much more direct ("here's some money, deal with it"), I love it!
@_date: 2019-01-12 09:47:05
Would you be interested in selling this [deck of crypto-themed playing cards]( I've developed?
@_date: 2019-01-30 22:33:45
I do agree that the title make it sound like an advertisement. I'll give you that. In my opinion, it still doesn't justify mocking him the way you did with rude and uneducated answers about problems that, again, may not concern you directly but still are very prominent in the current world. 
I personally don't think Bitcoin needs any publicity. People are going to realise soon enough that it offers a vast palette of advantages and that it solves a lot of problems that they may not have considered before. 
Surely you're going to accuse me of trying to sell you bitcoin, but I would advise you to read The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous. Or at least watch attentively this [30 min conference]( about it. Maybe it won't convince you and that is perfectly fine, but I'd be curious to have your opinion on the matter afterwards.
@_date: 2019-01-30 21:38:06
Thanks for this useful. Nevermind the ignorants and the trolls. I think you hit the nail right in the head.
Even if a lot of people cannot conceive how your points are relevant, *"because my bank account doesn't charge me anything and lets me pay for free!!!!!!"*.
@_date: 2019-01-16 21:58:34
I hate this logic. Seriously, this all comes down to the consumers, meaning to us!
Let me tell you, I sell Crypto-themed playing cards, I'm 99% sure that all my customers are crypto-users, crypto fans, crypto-believers, you name it. However, 95% of my orders are settled through paypal or credit card, while only 5% through cryptos. And I accept BTC, ETH, LTC, NEO/GAS, NANO, XLM, XRP (and plan on accepting more).
Why would bigger and more general stores accept cryptos when no one is paying with cryptos? 
TL;DR: You gotta practice what you preach.
@_date: 2019-01-12 02:34:23
Full disclosure: ETH, LTC and NEO also featured. Wanted to include this in the title but the modbot removed my post because it was about altcoins.
@_date: 2019-01-17 13:46:04
Why not a simple paper wallet to start? It's cheap and really fast to set-up?

How would you do that though? After one use, if the private key is displayed on the chip, then it'll be empty pretty quick.
@_date: 2019-01-27 08:47:06
 I've developed [bitcoin-themed playing cards]( to spread awareness in the general population. It's not much but it's a first step!

Why gridcoin?
@_date: 2019-01-25 19:07:28
Since there's been little action recently, thought I'd share about those Crypto Playing Cards I've developed and that I'm now trying to sell **[here]( The idea is to spread awareness in the general population through an existing and usable market, such as poker, blackjack, magic, etc.
@_date: 2019-01-21 10:21:14
Fuck this bear market. This is very frustrating.
I'll sell some merch at production costs ([Crypto Playing Cards and a T-shirt "Bitcoin is King"]( because the market is super slow currently.
@_date: 2019-01-27 08:05:10
I mean, PayPal is a third party that would get fucked over bad if cryptos became mainstream. Obviously he'll publicly say this but he can't be that dumb: he probably studied bitcoin quite intensely and knows what's up.
@_date: 2019-01-30 22:38:23
From another comment, the $7'000 figure comes from the article OP copied/pasted without sourcing it. Bad op.

There's a blank card that you can customise in the deck, you could definitely put doge as the Joker!

Have you ever taken part into a multi-million dollars cross-borders transaction? Do you really think it would cost $75 to achieve it?

Amazing, great way to help adoption! Wish I could attend! 
@_date: 2019-01-25 19:10:03
Forgot to add: cryptos more than welcome, and no third party in the transacton (like BitPay).
@_date: 2019-01-12 02:51:16
Interesting and very valid question. Don't listen to condescending pricks.
Losing a bitcoin (for example by sending it to an "unclaimed" or invalid address or when the only PK is deleted) is basically like burning a 100$ bill. The wealth disappears and cannot be retrieved by anybody. Although the coin still exists somewhere in the realm of its blockchain, it's literally impossible to gain access to the address to transfer it. "Burning" a coin or a token is exactly that by the way: "*The “burning” of the cryptocurrency involves sending the tokens to an address that is not controlled or that cannot be accessed by anyone. Usually the address is invalid which makes it entirely unusable. [It] is similar to what would happens if an individual sends a cryptocurrency to an address that does not exist. The tokens are forever lost in cyberspace.*" ([source](
The only way to access the public address and spend the lost bitcoins would be to "hack" the public address and guess the PK, which is basically impossible (unless you own quantum computers and are ready to spend significant amounts of energy): "brute-force attacks against 256-bit keys will be infeasible until computers are built from something other than matter and occupy something other than space" ([source](
Lost bitcoins increase the scarcity of "controllable" coins, which makes a bitcoin even more valuable. 
To answer your questions: 


Although they still exist, they are lost forever and should be discarded. 


The only way to make them active again is to recover the private key. Otherwise they're lost forever. 


That could be an issue for adoption as it's not possible to "lose money forever" with fiat, unless you literally burn it with fire. But that's the trade off: no third party is controlling your money so you need to be careful on how you handle it as you may make it disappear forever. That's another debate though.


Currently, the amount of energy need to hack bitcoin would be so enormous that it's impossible. Quantum computers might change that but even that is unsure.

It varies from [$14.90 to $9.30/deck]( depending on how many you order. Free worldwide shipping.
@_date: 2019-02-01 17:49:18
Please, watch [this]( His talk lasts 30 minutes but you will understand why Bitcoin has value.

Talking about fun little merch, what do you guys think of the [Crypto-themed playing cards]( I've made to help spread awareness?
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:54:28
I am checking manually every transaction, yes. I'm not flooded with sales so it's viable for now. 
You're awesome, I will send the cards on Monday.
About the price, you are right, I need to modify something. There should be an incentive to get bigger quantities, instead of just saving on shipping. Thanks for pointing it out!
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:15:13
Looking good!
I made something similar, namely Crypto Playing Cards. I got rid of spades, hearts, clubs and diamonds altogether though!
@_date: 2019-05-02 20:34:13
How do you verify the balance or if you've got a legit stick without electricity?

Thought about this but couldn't do it due to legal requirements. Since I printed a lot of decks, I didn't want to risk having to recall the product because of a cease and desist letter from someone who didn't like their pics. Wouldn't have been to afford something like this. :(
@_date: 2019-05-02 16:37:06
What about 
*Can be transferred physically.
*Can be transferred without electricity.
But those would ruin the nice looking row of checks I guess !
@_date: 2019-05-02 16:56:25
I mean it's a nice list with a cool row of checks... 
But it's only displaying the aspects where bitcoin beats gold or at least equals it.
Bitcoin cannot be transferred physically, needs electricity and internet for the blockchain to be adapted.
In most situation, this doesn't matter, but in some circumstances, it just might.
@_date: 2019-05-11 16:22:14
I have great hopes for the LN payment networks, but after having checked how to set it up, it's currently too much of a hassle to do it, and there's almost no use in my case. Barely 5% of the sales are made through bitcoin at the moment. 
In my business model, I think not getting an instant confirmation is fine, and everyone will be okay to wait one or 2 days if needed. After all, the shipping only takes almost 2 weeks. 
What's your take on that? Let me know, I'm interested to have your point of view!
