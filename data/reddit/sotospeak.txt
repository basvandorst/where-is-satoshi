Gotcha. I wouldn't even use the term "USD" since it's so tainted after being used by the political elites for 100 years of warfare and wealth redistribution.

The [rear view camera requirement]( is a sad joke. Do politicians hate poor people and want them to drive crappy used cars?

Who is "the commons"? Only individual humans are acting agents, and only individuals can own property or contract out the use of it.
Lots of today's property claims are invalid due to past historical rights violations. The rightful, previous owners should be returned their property, provided there is sufficient evidence of their claims. This is probably not the case for places like Boston, however I'm certain that some natives can prove they are the legitimate owners of places like in Oklahoma.

Using the bitcoin blockchain, yes there is lots of potential. Using some scam-coin "blockchain technology", no.

Even if merchants don't hold the bitcoins, their accepting of bitcoins grows the network of users. Eventually the network will grow to the point where they start to pay their suppliers, employees, etc in bitcoin... thus further growing the bitcoin community.
This is how bitcoins become worth $50,000 and more

Libertarian (aka "Lockean homesteading" or "first-use, first-own") property rights are the only logically justifiable property rights. Socialist (aka "workers as owners of the means of production") property rights are not justifiable:




From this logic, it follows that not all hierarchical relationships are a violation of one's rights. Only those relationships that violate private property rights are unjustified (taxation, the draft, and most other state actions). Most capitalist (aka worker-owner, renter-landowner) relationships are not aggressive as they respect private property.

What does fiat currency do that bitcoin cannot do? The only thing one can really list is "pay your taxes," but that's not enough in itself to give fiat value over bitcoin.
Therefor, if Bitcoin does everything fiat does (except taxes) and does it better, why is it incorrect to assume that bitcoin will replace fiat given enough time?

Two thoughts:
1.  $1 million is too low. If bitcoin replaces all fiat currency in the world (about $75 Trillion), then one bitcoin will be worth about $4 million each (in inflation adjusted dollars).
1. I think bitcoin will take a more s-curve growth. Getting to $100,000 will take a few more years, but once there, getting to $4 million won't take too much longer. Once bitcoin reaches a critical adoption/price point [hyperbitcoinization]( will occur. Everyone will start dumping their fiat currency into bitcoin, causing a price spiral.

I think it does make a difference because it means they've implemented the infrastructure to accept bitcoins (usually BitPay via a tablet/smartphone). From there it's much easier for them to start holding bitcoins for savings or spending on venders.
Imagine if every bar, alcohol distributor, and bartender (for tips) accepted bitcoin, even if they converted immediately to fiat. From that point it would be very easy to switch away from fiat since everyone is already used to used to accepting bitcoin.

Bitcoin can be made anonymous with coin-mixing, especially via Tor. Project like DarkWallet are working on improving this further.
How much of the world's commerce really take place in places without electricity and internet? In the past year, I've spent about $30,000 and of that maybe $40 took place at a location where bitcoin would not work (it was a Renascence fair). Realistically, bitcoin would work perfectly fine in 95%+ percent of transactions, and this number keeps growing rapidly as technology permeates the third world.

This whole "housing is an investment" ideology has got to go. Housing should keep going down in price and up in quality. Just like cars, energy, and all other consumer good.

At least 90% of Congress, every president, and almost every federal judge could reasonably be considered guilty of "intent to subvert the constitution". Who's going to try them for their crimes? Themselves?
Government is a collusion of thieves.

Speculative buying and hoarding of bitcoin is good for the growth of bitcoin. [This chart explains it]( More info [here](

What do you mean "rebooted USD"? USD and other fiat would all be gone after hyperbitcoinization. The world would be on a bitcoin "hard money" global currency, even better than during the gold standard of the 1800s.

That's why I said "inflation adjusted dollars." In unadjusted (nominal) dollars, bitcoins will be worth trillions and trillions since the currency will have hyperinflated into nothing (like German Marks in the 1930s or Zimbabwe currency).

What do you suppose we call a society that does not have a state (anarchist) but also has general respect for private property rights (capitalism)?
I'll admin that the word "anarchist" was first created and used by those with socialist/communist ideologies... but that doesn't discredit the term "anarcho-capitalism".

Sure, politicians and whatnot will want to implement paper money of some sort. But how will they be able to implement such a scheme? Bitcoin allows everyone to "be their own bank" without 3rd parties who are necessary to implement paper notes.
