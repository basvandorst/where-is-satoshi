I thought they had 0.5 to 1 million accounts. It seems they have only 88000 btc accounts

Exactly. About 100K users lost BTCs with Mtgox, many of them were early adopters, investors, traders.. people who believed and supported bitcoin. The community has to understand this.
And considering that just 500K own bitcoins, this is not something we can easily overcome.

They are all coming from this wallet 
and all splits and merges are in mtgox data feed : 
whoever is doing these TXs is doing through mtgox servers

less 100.000 users with BTCs stuck in mtgox

probably they recovered some, 180k-200k

Would it be possible to prove ownership by other means? such as sending a specific amount to one of the withdrawal addresses

Have a look at this deposit transaction from the leaked db:
e9ceb1e2-0497-427b-aca0-4f8e6aa2018a,557fe7d5-e199-474f-a1c0-6b2d05d568ae,"2014-02-05 23:18:00",deposit,43.3
it seems to match the same tx from the 12Nxd2X12WZeYSjUcbtm5NpS3d81Yh8sKh address:
if that's correct then 12Nxd2X12WZeYSjUcbtm5NpS3d81Yh8sKh is a mtgox customer

in order to allow withdrawals and sustain a large number of concurrent txs they need a large number of small wallets. It's not possible to process multiple concurrent withdrawals from a single large wallet

I'm interested in the project, but I don't get your estimation. Over the past 12 months, Mtgox traded about 15,000,000 BTCs. If we assume 0,50% trading fee, it would be 75000 BTCs per year. It will take 10 years to recover 750kBTCs.
Am I missing something here?
