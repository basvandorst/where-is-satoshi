More access to bitcoin for everyone!

Would be sweet to buy on such a platform. They are smart for following bitcoins advancement.

Baron Rothschild, an 18th century British nobleman and member of the Rothschild banking family, is credited with saying that "the time to buy is when there's blood in the streets."
It might be cheaper, but harder to obtain.

I agree value is based off cost of mining, or hauling from orbit.
@_date: 2019-10-12 15:01:29
Yep, all about fee’s. You have the right idea, but it’s way cheaper to transact, you will have the ability to set  buys or sells on orders.  That’s if you want to buy and sell. 
Or just Hodl on a coldwallet like a Trezor.  If you don’t know your seed words. You don’t own your bitcoin.  You will see this phrase over and over until it clicks.

Love me some bitcoin, Btc may have dropped in value against the dollar but I have Sats and that’s what I want! Cheers!

Yeah, I’m diving in also. Have some arduino projects completed but a Pi node would be sweet. Some day I’ll understand. More research! Thanks for all the links.

Yep, had a ledger nano s, wouldn’t update correctly, felt like a play toy. Ordered a Tezor. Very happy.
@_date: 2019-10-02 21:19:13
Maybe, I did. Still felt cheap after having one of each. Might be a good show of user friendliness. My vote is still with Tezor.

ThIS Is the LaSt TimE YoU’lL bE aBle tO bUY suB 10k...lol

Maybe your ability to Hodl is effected, Maybe your ability to buy extra at the end of the month is cut. Recession weed out bad business. That’s my 2 sats.

Not mine, Coinbase is a swell place. But no exchange keeps my coins. Not your key words not your coins.
@_date: 2019-12-09 00:21:35
Ahh. It’s doing that thing again.
@_date: 2019-09-24 22:09:57
I got Rekt on my hodling pile. Bought up the  loss on the dip. Pretty happy about it really. Stacking sats.
@_date: 2019-09-21 15:14:23
That’s sweet.

I had “mug firmware not genuine” prompted on mine and said. NOPE. Tried to boot launch it but it never helped, got caught in a odd cycle. Never gave me much of a good feeling. Ledge nano s
@_date: 2019-09-25 15:15:46
Right, haven’t lost a thing. I haven’t sold a thing either. Buying the dip and getting back to work myself.

Interesting take on the unknown. I would like to see someone continue this valuable video with the addition of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-22 15:04:02
100% not dumb. I like to read your updates. Real news in a world full of entertainment news.
@_date: 2019-09-19 03:50:56
This. Gotta keep some dry powder ready to strike! Bought that dip!
