Bitcoin is the largest and most secure network and it’s the only network safe to transfer a billion dollars of value in a single transaction and not be worried about a 51% attack on the transaction to double spend it. 
That network security through hashing might is unique to bitcoin and is a consequence of its vastly superior mining network vs any other coin. Large multi billion dollar transactions are necessary for worldwide adoption. 
No other network can do that.

Bitcoin isn’t anonymous. What’s your point?
If you want anon go Monero. 
High prices drive innovation. Markets are good. All it says when dollars are traded for BTC is that people think it’s valuable. 
That’s good for everyone. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:14:05
It started worthless and went up from nothing with no use. Now it has use and a multi billion dollar mining industry behind it.  It’s not going to zero. Lol

Tech goes up that fast. Stop thinking like a human and start thinking like a machine. Bitcoin is digital money. It’s not going to behave according to classical rules. It’s based on innovation. Watch what happens when lighting gets deployed and is working properly.

Bitcoin has the largest and most secure network. Ethereum is also good. 
There is value in having a value transfer system that doesn’t depend on a 3rd party. 
There is utility in programmable money. 
Scaling issues will be resolved in time. 
Other coins are valid experiments too. But bitcoin has the largest network so it’s the only network that is safe to transfer a billion $ worth of wealth on and have a high degree of confidence that the transaction will not be doublespent. Smaller networks can be defeated with enough computing power.  
Not all coins are the same.

The average person isn’t the fucking issue. Average people suck the dick of the corporate banks. You will use what they tell you to use. 
Bitcoin makes the argument that an alternative system can be created that levels the playing field and gives you the option to choose to transfer value electronically in a way that is outside the permission of bankers.

@_date: 2018-09-02 14:45:14
Not at all. It’s just industrial scale. 
Small scale too. 
When mining companies run their own nuclear reactor to power the mining clusters and give away excess energy and heating as a tax deduction then we will be talking actual full scale mining operations.  
The end game is probably nation states running mining operations in competition with each other. 
No centralization. Just massive scale.

Nothing in the market beats Apple in terms of device ecosystem and ease of use. 
Samsung and android in general requires you to babysit your phone. Manage apps. Adjust settings. Basically you have to operate it like you do any computer. 
Apple on the other hand is like an appliance or device. It is locked down. You can’t fuck it up. It just works and it works with all your other Apple products seamlessly.  
That premium is worth it to people who value their time and energy more than money. 
Additionally the camera and apps are first class. 
Some of us don’t view money as the sole issue when deciding on tech. 
A device is more than the sum of its parts.

To your second point: You can do that with crypto too. It is called a multi party transaction.  Mediator services will co-sign a transaction between you and the merchant. In the event of a dispute the mediator can deny the transaction and protect your funds.

You don’t seem to understand how a few things work. 
He doesn’t have the power to just “stop the press”. That’s illegal. He can’t do that. 
But what he can do is lie and spread propaganda to undermine people’s ability to tell truth from fiction. 
He lies and then he says the press is lying when they call him out on it.  
So he’s using fear and group think and propaganda to trick people who don’t seek the facts into believing that the free press is actually lying when in fact he is lying.
Classic bully technique. 
Hitler did the same thing when he blamed the Jews for the failing economy in Germany. 
Trump blames the problems on “they” and if you don’t agree with him then you are “they”

I own an iPhone and a Mac and a PC. 
I use the Mac and pc for dev work where I need control over the device. 
But what I carry in my pocket I just need it to always work and get out of my way. So I use iPhone. I don’t want full control over that device. I am happy to give control over to Apple on that platform because I don’t want to think about it. 
That is intentional and it’s not because I am dumb or tech illiterate (I design and build virtual reality software). 
The device in my pocket needs to just work without asking me to manage it manually. Apple is the only platform that does that.

No, the price is not why it’s interesting. 
People like and use crypto because the technology is revolutionary and enables new forms of commerce and implementation that is simply not possible before. 
The fiat to crypto exchange rate is only relevant now in this time period because we still do not fully utilize a digital money system so we have these gateways and exchange rates connecting old world money to new crypto money. 
Once the world comes into the light of crypto the “price” will become obsolete. 
Every child in the world today growing up and unable to access banking services is already exposed to crypto.  It’s going to be the most natural thing in the world for them and traditional fiat will seem archaic by comparison. 
Agent AIs that buy and sell their own resources and exist online without any human oversight will operate solely on crypto. Traditional banking will not be compatible. 
There will be many more discoveries and innovations in this field of computer science as time moves forward. 
The price isn’t going up or down in terms of bitcoin. Bitcoin is always with a bitcoin. The dollars are what is volatile as people realize it’s all imaginary. Crypto is actually more real.

Crypto is a unit of account that works at a distance and is immune to corruption.  
Some crypto support smart contracts. This allows for automated behavior - programmable money.  That’s a fascinating utility. 
So you have programmable finite resources that are immune to centralization and manipulation that can be transferred over any distance with minimal costs. 
That’s a very interesting set of properties that is in and of itself a product.

Dude, you printed him a paper wallet?! Wtf? Are you trying to teach him bad crypto skills? He clearly has no idea that you could have kept a copy of his priv key. I assume you didn’t but let’s say this guy goes and starts thinking bitcoin is this paper thing and decides to make a photocopy and give it to someone else?! 
Setup newbs the proper way: have them install a wallet on their smartphone and send them some BTC right then and there.  Not only is this safer for you and him, but it also teaches him about the online transaction. How to do one, scanning QR codes, etc.   plus if he wants to sell it he can easily move it since it’s already online. 
Handing him a paper wallet is just causing him grief down the road and requires honesty on your part. Something I’m sure you do, but not everyone does. That’s why bitcoin is supposed to be trustless.

Banks will offer services to insure and hold your crypto with a miltipart key. People will use this because they feel safe storing their gold where someone can’t hit them with a wrench and take their money. 
Governments will exist so long as people are desiring to be organized into heriarchical structures.  Some governance mechanisms will be augmented to become more efficient and transparent and streamlined through crypto. 
Corporations will exist as long as people have a desire to organize capital and labor into efficient systems to provide goods and services. Some corporations will be autonomous.

Diff is that coding standards and programming profession wasn’t as mature and widespread when the internet was formed as it is now.

Because for many of the unbanked or the underbanked it is difficult or impossible to go through the process of getting registered on an exchange.

I like the article up until this point:
“Other cryptocurrencies are not disruptive. They accept the status quo; that money can and should be inflated. Making a choice to refuse inflation by using Bitcoin is one of the most profoundly disruptive actions you can take.”
The author assumes that any token other than BTC is somehow ok with inflationary monetary supply and only BTC is finite. That’s just not true.  There are many other coins that have a fixed money supply.

Honestly, if the gov just gave a way for him to pay taxes he would pay taxes. 
Maybe we should look at the crime itself and say "hmm... people want drugs, maybe we should regulate the sale and distribution of drugs."
Say though it's mafia shakedown, not drugs at all but some downright criminal evil shit. I still say let them pay taxes and figure out a different way to bust them.

See, I hear your rage but I am absolutely NOT a stateist and from our point of view on the left it looks like the republicans and the right are nationalistic and fascist. So what's going on here? Are we divided against each other with a different lens of propaganda ?
I truly believe that an over bearing government is a terrible thing. I also think that unregulated business take advantage of people. So I think we are actually on the same team. 
I hear you have a lot of anger but you really need to recognize that we are all humans and the problem is the machine that controls us. Being angry at me doesn't solve the problem. It just lets you dehumanize someone that is probably ideologically similar to you. 
The way the elite retain power is by dividing the masses against each other.  So unless you have over $10,000,000 we are probably more alike than you are to Trump and his ilk. 
When the people are united then good things happen.  Keeping division in the country is great for big business and fascists. 
Instead of being angry all the time and blaming others try talking to people with different points of view and suspend your ideology for a moment and try listening to their concerns.  They may have a valid point as I'm sure you do as well.

No, they never have been. That's why democracies fail and Republics succeed. The original design of the USA was that only wealthy people could participate in elections (ignoring racism and sexism for a moment) the idea being that people who had a stake in the system would vote.

Would you be surprised to learn that I feel that trump and the Republican Party are doing exactly what you claim liberals are doing? I think that policies enacted by republicans are directl infringing on social liberties of many of us. So perhaps it's possible that we are on the same team and that the government is corrupt on both sides of the isle? 
The enemy isn't me or you, it's the ultra wealthy corporations that want to destroy the environment and destroy the economy and remove your liberty for short term profits.

What are you talking about? Lightning IS bitcoin. It doesn’t create a new coin or add derivatives or anything like that. 
Lightning can not exist without bitcoin. They are the same thing. LN is just using nTimeLockVerify opcodes to hold funds off chain until one of the parties decides to settle it on chain. 
Then they do some fancy networking magic to allow peers to discover each other in a decentralized manner and splice payment channels. That’s next level wizardry. But it doesn’t undermine bitcoin foundation in any way.

What are your credentials? Are you a tax attorney?
Income reporting is voluntary. 
The way I see it is that if you bought Bitcoin with coinbase and transferred it out you either have to claim that you still have it or provide info that you sold it and when and for how much. 
I doubt the IRS is going to try to follow each transaction through the blockchain.
They haven't provided guidance on how to report except to say that when you sell keep a record and when you buy keep a record. 
The tax code is voluntary. That means you are expected to be an honest citizen and report your income. just like any all cash business. If you sold hot dogs it would be exactly the same.  The business owner is expected to be honest.

Any computer you use has the risk of malware. 
That means even if your .dat is encrypted and secure you are sooner or later going to need to read it into computer memory in order to use it. 
If that computer is compromised then the keys can be stolen from memory. 
Hardware wallets never let the keys out of the device.  Even if connected to an infected computer your keys are secure.  Hardware wallets have a recovery seed that can recreate the wallet on a new device if needed. Secure that seed someplace safe!! It is your money!
Paper wallets are fine for cold storage but they can fade over time and sooner or later they have to be loaded into memory which is insecure.

Correct, keyboard could be compromised. However, Keyboard is not often flashable or reprogammable. However, BIOS and GPU are.  So are disk controllers. 
No it wouldn't take a government. Just a college comp sci student with a bit of time on their hands. 
There is a reason hardware wallets exist is because confirmation happens on the device itself. No keyboard logging is possible. 
You can use a hardware wallet on a fully infected and compromised machine without risk.  You can use a hardware wallet on a public coffee shop computer without worry or need to reboot the public terminal.

No screen on the device is going to protect you against that because you have no way to verify the address being. Shown to you on the website is legit to begin with and actually belongs to the intended recipient. Your system is compromised. You are fucked.

Make damn sure you can recover from the recovery seed before transferring large sums to hardware wallet. 
Do a test. Transfer 0.01 BTC first. Then wipe the device. Then see if you can recover from the backup seed.  If that works then it's safe for the rest. 
Keep the recovery seed somewhere safe!!
Write it out by hand (it's 24 words) and NEVER put it in a computer. 
Make copies if needed for extra security. 
Lose the seed or have it stolen and you lose the money. So while not vulnerable to hacking you are still vulnerable to fire, flood, theft, and carelessness.  Mitigate those risks with good hiding places and multiple copies in multiple locations.

No laws against it. Just math.  If one guy can buy up 60% of the hash rate and break bitcoin then just imagine what a national government like the USA could do with nearly unlimited funds! Bitcoin has to be able to survive this attack. If it can’t then it will not survive a bigger attempt by a more well resourced actor.

I think Germany is one of the most liberal and open minded countries I have ever had the pleasure to visit. 
My feeling is that because of the past they made great efforts to never repeat that mistake. 
However, don’t underestimate the power of the tax man. It’s devilishly easy to trace transactions on the chain and until we have reliable privacy safeguards it remains easy for government to trace transactions. 
As such the tax laws can be used to control cryptocurrencies. Germany has the right idea treating it like a currency. America is backwards in treating it like property. 
Be careful though, it’s a dangerous proposition when the powers that be feel threatened. 
In 1977 the USA confiscated all the gold of its citizens. 
This is not something we should take lightly. When men with guns create a law and then come to your door demanding your crypto it’s a problem.

“But, while the connectivity problem can be a difficulty, it can also be an opportunity to generate a network of trusted nodes, which Beezy classified as routing nodes. In this case, they would be nodes with high uptime, always online, always available and with high liquidity.
In this case, the network would have a secure way of creating and routing payments, while the operators of this type of nodes (be they companies or individuals) would benefit from the collection of commissions and the high traffic of payments through their nodes.”
Wtf?! “Trusted nodes” I thought the whole idea was to be a trustless distributed p2p network? To me this sounds like having a lot of trust in some key players that have the ability to coordinate to censor payments if they deem it worthwhile. Am I misunderstanding this?

You don’t seem to understand. I can not run a business if I know every time I pay a supplier that the supplier can look back and see how much money I had in that address. They will change their prices next time and charge me more. 
Also, if you pay the bar in bitcoin and the bartender goes and looks and sees how much you have in the address and then says “oh shit look at all that coin on his address!” Guess who is going to be waiting in the ally for you with a baseball bat?
Furthermore what happens if Facebook (or any social network) starts making it so that people can host their xpub key for receiving payments? Suddenly privacy is not so private even to the public as that network will have the xpub of everyone and be able to spy on all transactions in their network and easily link names to addresses.  
It’s not enough that it’s pseudo anonymous in that people who don’t know you can’t figure anything out. That’s publicly anonymous and that’s fine. The problem is that it’s totally transparent to anyone you ever do any transaction with and THAT IS DANGEROUS!

I can never find a good answer to this but what if the LN becomes the main layer that everyone transacts on? It’s fast and cheap and secure. I see no reason to ever settle back onto layer 1. That just slows everything down. 
If nobody settles on layer 1 then miners get no fees. Eventually block reward goes to 0. Miners drop out. Security drops. Network collapses.

Valid point about tricking the chip to spend to an incorrect address 
I presume it’s tied into the biometrics ? As in - the chip itself authenticates the biometrics and is a required input to sign a transaction. 
It would make sense for the chip to also house the biometric signatures. 
So input to the chip would be: transaction to be signed plus biometrics. 
The chip then verifies biometrics before signing transaction.

I can not see all the addresses you own. No. 
But. If you have 2 BTC on an address and send me 0.01 I can see that you have 1.99 left. So I know you have at least 1.99 and I can see where it is. And then if you ever send all your funds to another address I can see which ones all belonged to you in the past and get an idea for your total net worth.

It costs money to pay the electric bill to mine the coins. Plus it costs money to buy / build the hardware to mine plus cooling costs. 
The miner has an investment and monthly expenses. They are running a business with slim margins. They need to sell their coins at a value high enough to recoup the cost or they need to close shop.

Yes my point is that by labeling people "liberals" you are intrinsically dehumanizing them and discounting anything that may be of value to contribute to a greater understanding of the socioeconomic problems that we all face.  Liberalism isn't necessarily a bad thing nor is conservatism. In some areas of life it's good to be generous and in some areas it's wise to be conservative.  Dehumanizing people is doing a disservice to your own best interests. 
All science and philosophy and art is advanced by escaping the blankets of labels and definitions and trying to see the world with open fresh eyes.  I know you are an intelligent human that wants to see the world as a better place. Surely you want your life and your family's to be improved ?

If LN works as advertised it should be secure and stable.  Why wouldn’t you send $10k? Or even $100,000,000 for that matter? If the tech works as promised there is really no reason to ever settle on chain unless you wanted to switch it over to fiat, and even then the exchange that you send it to could keep it on LN and choose not to settle. 
So I don’t see why anyone would ever choose to settle on chain if LN works as advertised. ??

I don’t see why it would be any diff to send $1 vs $100,000 ? All I would do diff is make sure the decimal point is in the right place and count my zeros. I wouldn’t think to concern myself with the underlying transport mechanism. And if I need to understand how the transport works (LN) then I won’t use it for large value transfer. I would just use a bank and wire transfer. Which sucks because the whole promise of BTC/LN is that I don’t need to know how it works 
I don’t need to know how TCP/IP works and I can use it for transport of 100 bytes or 1,000,000 bytes. It works in either case equally well. That’s what makes it robust. I don’t need to say “oh wait, this file is large. I should mail a USB drive instead”

Yes, but you are applying cold logic where reason is needed instead.  
You are applying some sort of elitist absolutist view. The truth is that they could not do that sort of rollback now. But it was needed then. It was small enough and there was a fork. Those that wanted to keep the old system continued along as ETC. those that desired the rollback were able to. 
Having one entity control majority of the stake would be bad for everyone. 
It was the right move. Nobody lost out except the hacker and he still got a ton of money on ETC for free.

You say “yet” that’s I think where the confusion is. I don’t care where it is today. What I care about is the roadmap. All my questions are about what it is intended to become. I understand software takes time to fully develop. So you say it isn’t a high value payment solution (yet). Implying that one day it will be high value. 
So if that’s the case it goes back to my original question; if one day LN is a high value second layer solution (as I am presuming it is intended to become) then why would anyone need to cash out if LN is both secure and fast ? 
And if they don’t settle on chain then who feeds the miners to secure the base layer once block rewards are gone and there is no incentive to cash out since by this time the 2nd layer is robust and fault tolerant and high capacity and quick ?
I’m not trolling, I’m genuinely concerned about the future of BTC as nobody can give me a clear and good answer to this fundamental game theory question:
Presuming LN reaches its manifest destiny of high value high speed transport with low fees and secure transactions then WHY settle on chain ? And by extension when nobody settles on chain and the whole economy lives on the 2nd layer then the miners are not paid so they drop out and that undermines the hash rate which results in a weakening of the security model that LN is built on. What am I not understanding?

Wire transfer is a pain in the ass and nobody uses that if they can help it. 
If LN is safe and instant there is no reason people would ever settle on chain. Unless it isn’t safe. 
Why would I go through the trouble of moving funds off of LN ? Isn’t LN supposed to be safe?
If it isn’t safe then why would I use it or trust it ?
@_date: 2019-01-29 00:18:09
BTC/LN is more like tcp/ip than it is like a wire transfer. 
Movement of money at instant speed opens whole new possibilities in commerce that were not possible before without credit lines and even they are too slow. 
Humans are only half the end user scenarios. If the network is not secure then how do we trust it to handle autonomous agents ?
@_date: 2019-01-27 23:37:14
Why shouldn’t LN do $100k transactions ? Is there going to be some sort of test people have to take to learn proper usage of this new magic internet money ?? If so then we are asking for failure. The vast majority of people just want something that’s easy to use and work with.  If this stuff requires people to know to not trust LN with $100k of value then how is it going to be useful as a global commerce ? $100k isn’t even that much money. $10k is laughable.  We need to be able to support TRILLIONS in global commerce.  People buying and selling whole pallets of cars and vast tracts is real estate entire corporations., billions worth of stock in a matter of seconds. That’s what the whole promise of smart decentralized money is about. If we have to continue to rely on centralized third party clearing houses then we are kinda not really going far enough with this whole experiment and it will just remain a niche for internet nerd money. 
I think you think too small. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 22:47:56
No, bits are 100 satoshi. As in, I have a bit of satoshis. 
Also a bit is already a metric that is 1,000,000 bits per bitcoin. 
So 100 satoshis is 1 bit.
Further, this gives us 2 decimal points of precision which is something people are already familiar with in money: example: 845 satoshis is 8.45 bit
We can scale that up to Kb if needed or Mb. 1 Mb = 1BTC

No, I think you seriously do not understand end user psychology.  
They don’t read these forums. They don’t understand tech. They push a button and the money moves. Hey if it’s secure for $20 it’s good for $200,000! That’s the way the VAST majority of people think. 
If LN can’t handle the security of a $1,000,000 transaction then it’s broken from the start. We can not expect end users to understand how LN works anymore than we can expect end users to know the diff between UDP/IP and TCP/IP.  ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS PUSH BUTTON MONEY MOVE!
@_date: 2019-01-20 16:38:55
Really!? You don’t know what’s wrong with that ? Haha
Ok let me explain. 
I have a lemon stand. I sell lemons. They are ok. Not the best but decent. 
Many other kids on the block sell lemons. 
You sell lemons. 
One day. I get a bunch of money from my grandma who passed away. 
So I start selling lemons at $0.01 for 2!  Nobody can beat that price. I run at a loss 
I drive all the competition out of business. I buy up the rights to their lemon stands and now I own all the lemon stands. 
Now. Since I have a monopoly and I have cornered he market I raise the price to $12 for a lemon and we are only open on Thursday’s from 5pm to 9pm
Fuck! Customers are pissed but what are they going to do? They have to buy my lemons because I am the sole lemon supplier. 
Don’t like it? Too bad — suck an orange. 
That’s literally why we have antitrust laws.

I’m not comparing LN to the past. I’m comparing it to future techs that can promise people convenience without pain or high fees. The people don’t care if it is decentralized or not. They just care that it’s cheap and it works.

@_date: 2019-01-27 23:40:02
LN makes the advertised promise of instant bitcoin transactions.  It doesn’t say “instant bitcoin transactions with only a few dollars” 
It theoretically shouldn’t have a limit and if it does then why bother, it’s not going to be useful enough and some other tech will achieve that status. 
I like LN. I like BTC. I want them to succeed but if we can’t face these questions and give solid answers then we are kinda just fucking around.

Deciding when to settle and open channels. The distinction between “checking” and “savings” 
People don’t think like that. Most people only have a checking account. Many are underwater in debt and live paycheck to paycheck. 
It’s not reasonable to expect an easy onboarding of the masses if we ask them to make a distinction between two esoteric account types (on chain and LN) and then tell them that one is more secure than the other and one has more fees than the other. It’s going to be very confusing for them and they will just hand it over to custodial services who handle all that “complicated stuff” for them.

Well that doesn’t work then. If you are building a global payment network with potentially trillions of dollars flowing through it we can’t have “subject to hacking” being an issue. 
People are not going to know to settle on chain or not. Someone is going to sell their house on LN payment network and not realize they need to settle those funds on chain and if that means they can be hacked that’s a fault of the technology implementation NOT the end user. 
It is irresponsible of technologists to blame the end user for not understanding esoteric payment gateways and hacking vectors. 
This stuff needs to be more secure than banks and easier and faster.

You also can't spend it easily without loading it into a device.  Paper is fine for cold storage but sucks for anything else. It doesn't scale and widespread adoption won't work if the answer is "paper wallet"  further if the RNG is compromised when making paper wallets you absolutely can be backdoored.

Well that's just stupid of them to bunch them up in a pile. They should have a set of addresses for each user. Separate!

Can someone please explain to me how Ripple is able to handle the scaling capacity while bitcoin can not?
@_date: 2017-05-01 17:50:43
I think you are missing the bigger picture. It's not about what YOU do. A currency that is only for storing and can't be easily spent is useless. I have paper wallets too. Big deal. They are totally useless for actually securing and spending funds on a day to day basis. You know, actually USING bitcoin for what it was intended for and the reason we all hold in speculation anyhow. 
Paper is not a mass market solution. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 06:19:17
They simply need to provide customers with access to their private keys. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 11:43:43
Unsatisfactory solution for widespread consumer adoption of bitcoin.

What if you have a password to a site, say even a site like coinbase, essentially the keys are on their servers. So not even on your phone. All your phone has is an app that is password protected. Passwords are personal information, not monetary instruments. 
Taken to the next logical step you could avoid all that entirely and just use a brain wallet. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:37:26
DO NOT USE BLOCKCHAIN.info wallet for large amounts. 
Get a real wallet. Hardware is ideal such as Trezor or Nano S, but even smartphone wallets such as Jaxx, Mycelium, or breadwallet are better than webwallets. 
Or electrum on Pc/Mac 
@_date: 2017-07-24 06:20:58
5) coinbase gives customers access to private keys 
@_date: 2017-07-31 02:14:53
That's on them that they made the stupid decision to pile all coins together.  Each customer should have their own vault. It's not like they couldn't do that. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:03:56
Install Jaxx
Write down the backup phrase, store it in a safe place. That is as good as cash. Lose it and you lose your money. Have it stolen and your money is stolen. 
Then transfer funds to jaxx Wallet. 
Jaxx can store BTC, ETH, and LTC
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:38:17
No. If you restored the 12 word seed from a differn t wallet you basically overwrote the keys from the step 2 with the new keys. 
In effect nullifying the operation of writing down your seed in step 2. 
What you have done is created two wallets both pointing to the same address. 
Do this: first make sure the funds are still on blockchain.info if they are not then DO NOT PROCEED to the next step. 
Then re-initialize your jaxx wallet. Delete it and re-install it. This will wipe the keys from your device.  When you restart jaxx create a NEW wallet and write down the NEW seed as you did prior and store that in a safe place (you can discard the old paper that you wrote down the old seed on prior)
Then you should have an EMPTY wallet. 
TRANSFER the funds to your new empty wallet FROM blockchain to the address displayed in Jaxx. Do not RESTORE your funds, totally different operations. 
Once the transfer is complete you should see a zero balance on blockchain and a new balance on jaxx (minus small transaction fees)
Definition of terms:
Transferring funds is an operation of moving money from A to B. 
Restoring a wallet recreates the wallet on a new device. The funds don't change addresses. Therefor the keys that are associated with blockchain are just as vulnerable still. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 03:56:24
Not the same thing at all. Having access to private keys allows you to access BCC on alt chain. 
Smartly you should withdraw and not trust coinbase.  But if they did provide the keys users could do it themselves

Aug 1 deadline for UASF is already deployed. A decision will be made. Fork will happen or miners will realize this is a bad idea for them and agree to adopt SegWit without forking which is better for their bottom line. Therefor since SegWit is going to be deployed it seems reasonable to invest in bitcoin.

Why though ? No transaction fees and block reward goes to 0 eventually

Set up a time lock script on funds to be delivered to you after arrival. 
You can then legally say "nope, I don't have any funds" and 24 hours after arrival your coins arrive in your wallet.
