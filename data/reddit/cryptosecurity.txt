Great points. Authy is actually two different apps:
1) First is the Authy app where you provide a phone number to the 3rd party site ABC.com and Authy, verify control of phone number via SMS and now you can use the 7-digit codes generated by Authy on ABC.com. In this case, phone number is essentially being used as a password to allow multiple devices to be linked to the same account. So if an attacker ports your phone number via SIM swap, then they can easily download Authy on a new device by verifying control of the phone number via SMS. To prevent this attack vector, you should turn off multi-device capability in Authy. There is a second attack vector involving Authy's account recovery, where attacker can claim lost access to app, and download app on a new device by again confirming ownership of phone number. These are serious vulnerabilities that can be prevented altogether if you install a TOTP app. TOTP app's secret key stays on your device, is never cloud-backed and is not linked to your phone number. Hence, even if your phone number is ported to a new device/SIM, attacker can't get control of the TOTP secret keys stored on your device
2) Second is Authy as a TOTP app which you link via QR code like Google/Microsoft Authenticator or Duo. In this case, Authy goes a step forward and allows users to back up their secret keys in the cloud via a password thats only known to the user. Note however, that this is again just another password which once leaked could be brute-forced. So even in this regards, its better to keep your security in your own hands and not rely on anything (including this password) thats backed to the cloud.

Phone porting or sim swap attacks are very real. Lots of people have lost lots of money recently due to it.
