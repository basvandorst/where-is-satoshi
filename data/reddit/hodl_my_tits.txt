I mean, you could go back there and continue on with the unlimited Bitcoin chain if you wanted using that exploit. I doubt many people would follow.

You can give or receive up to 14k/year tax free in the USA. You may need to pay taxes on it if it's a sale, but giving it away is free up to 14k per year per person.

Average turn around for doubling your investment in Bitcoin I believe was 6 months based on historical data. Just hang on, accumulate as we go.

Is there anyway to still sign up as someone that lost bitcoin due to this? Once it happened I turned away from the bitcoin scene in general and fear I may have lost my chance to claim losses.
Thanks for taking the time to address this and talk to the community.
Edit: I see you are advising people to contact a Japanese lawyer from other comments. Thanks again!

I was paying $40 to move $100 in December, or any other amount. So regardless, it was ridiculous. It's better now but we may see transactions fees go through the roof if we get the same amount of traffic.

It goes up with time. Make some purchases and every few months it will go up.
