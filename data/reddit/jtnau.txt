With Lightning Network likely only months away, I suspect a lot of companies that previously thought *"Bitcoin's OK, but 7 tx/sec can't meet our needs"* (aka "The Fidelity Effect") may now be planning to come on-board.

The original report was issued in 2014.  The updated report from last year (linked above) includes an addendum.
The passage I quoted is from the addendum, and so is the most recent commentary from the author on his position.
I guess many just don't want to believe what the report implies.

Because these types of announcements, be it a new partnership, a new exchange, a new app, a new debit card, etc.  are all about one thing; making it easier for the masses to buy Bitcoins.
But despite several years of media coverage, the masses are obviously still not interested.
Hence, there's no reason to believe this announcement (like others before it) will create increased demand for BTC.

Everyone who's following this story knows Craig Wright is Australian, so this post is just creating a story around the details that we already know about him.  It's not providing anything verifiable.
Also, why do people always claim that British and Australian accents sound similar?  Does Hugh Jackman really sound similar to Benedict Cumberbatch to some people?  I don't get it ...
@_date: 2016-04-20 18:27:55
I said "likely" months away .... "likely".
In any event, my post was less about whether it *will* arrive soon, but rather the *perception* by companies that it'll arrive soon, which may cause them to plan for Bitcoin (as opposed to dismissing it out of hand, as they currently do).

Shortly afterward, the nascent bubble formation would dissipate.  Always.
So, the fact that he hasn't posted yet bodes well for its chances :)
EDIT:  Dammit. It seems he posted earlier today.  We're going back to $426 I guess ...

I don't know what he's worried about.  It's not like the Chinese government can just seize the mining farms and put a gag notice on the operators (or worse) ... thereby controlling 90% of the hash rate of the Bitcoin network and effectively making it state-controlled for an extended period of time without outside parties realizing it.
That could never happen.

If Craig Wright is able to prove he's Satoshi, it's just as likely to cause a drop in the price, for a couple of reasons.
The existing narrative is that Satoshi is a private person, shuns publicity and is, possibly, dead.  These *perceived* characteristics make it easier to sell the argument that Satoshi will never sell his coins (estimated as around 1 million) - an act that would carry a high risk of causing a price plummet.  However, if Satoshi voluntarily reveals himself, then that narrative is destroyed - he's alive and well, and willing to be a public figure ... which means no-one can say anymore that "Satoshi would never do ..." (insert your own projection here).  So, maybe he will sell his coins ...
Also, if it's Craig Wright, then he's currently under investigation by the Australian Taxation Office.  I'm not making any moral judgement on this, but I know that the media would and would try to paint Satoshi as a tax doger and criminal ("Did you invent Bitcoin to avoid your tax obligations Mr Wright??!!").  So there's likely to be some not-so-positive press in the near future if he's revealed.
So, there are a lot of negatives to his reveal (again ... IF it's Craig Wright) and there are really no positives, because frankly I don't think either Core or Classic will really care what he thinks, because their positions are too firmly entrenched at this point, and the miners couldn't care less (for them it's not about ideology, it's business).

I agree it will eventually get above $1000 again.  I'm just not convinced the 2016 bubble will do that, given we no longer have Karpeles' "Willy Bot" to help things along like last time.

"... accessible more easily ... to a bigger group of people"
Firstly, it's already very easy to purchase BTC in the UK or Europe.  So the people who *want* to buy it, are able to buy it.  Making it even easier is not going to draw in the moms &amp; pops - they are avoiding BTC because they don't see any need for it, not because they find it difficult to purchase. 
Secondly, this announcement is not providing access to a "bigger group of people" because Circle is not moving into a market hitherto restricted from BTC ... anybody in the UK or Europe (the target market for the Circle announcement) who *wants* to buy Bitcoin, can currently buy it.  
If anything, Circle's KYC &amp; AML conditions for signing up with them will be more stringent than what's currently required from their competitors.
@_date: 2016-04-06 23:58:35
Yes, these people (early adopters) will continue to buy Bitcoin and a new partnership between Circle and Barclay's isn't going to impact that.
Which was my point - the Circle announcement isn't any kind of "game changer" leading to a new influx of buyers. So why would anyone expect the market/price to react to it in any way?

Two years ago, 50 "experts" predicted what Bitcoin will be trading at by early 2015:

If they'd wanted to comply, then they'd have needed to require their uses to setup accounts (so identities could be verified).
I can't see how this would have led to 'chaos' after the hack though, given that (1) no customers would have lost money anyway, since ShapeShift doesn't hold customer's fund (even if they'd required their customers to have verified accounts), and (2) the BitLicense itself never made any promises that license holders are somehow immune from hacks.
As with the other posts here, not sure what the OP is trying to imply ....

It's not that black and white.  The real world has shades of grey.  There are many people in the west who'd class themselves as "anti-capitalist" but in reality they're just fed up with 'The System', which is a corruption of true free market economics.   Bailing out banks?  That's not capitalism mate.  That's corporate socialism, but unfortunately to many people they *think* that it's a manifestation of capitalism, hence the misdirected rage.
Louis CK produces products and offers these products for sale to his customers on the free market.  That is the opposite of Marxism.
It doesn't matter what he says because his actions speak louder than words - he's engaging in free market economics willingly (and I'd venture quite happily).

It's *far* more likely the intent of the hack was to steal Bitcoins, rather than sell account details online.
Also, companies are regularly getting hacked with personal details exposed and it rarely descends into "chaos", loss of "all credibility" and the companies don't "stop operating" in the aftermath. For example, people are still signing up to and using the Playstation Network, even though it was exposed with a hack a while back and I'm sure there are countless examples of similar instances.
So, the hypothetical scenario you paint is an unlikely, worst-case scenario. The more likely outcome would have been criticism and annoyance directed at ShapeShift, rather than 'chaos'.
