Not at this moment, eventually yeah, but I guess I can hold off transferring my coins elsewhere until later. And maybe- just maybe they'll fix all their security problems by then and I don't need to move them.

I don't want to seem lazy, but I haven't yet done research, so; could you recommend some?

Would you mind writing that rundown? If it was too long, maybe a tldr version. I feel i understand bitcoin but I cant explain it well.

I have bitcoin- but I always fear that at one point in time, some super-techy guy will figure out a very big vulnerability in the bitcoin code (or maybe just quantum computers will do so) and then, not only may I lose all my bitcoin, but bitcoin itself will be rendered obsolete. Is this paranoia justifiable? or do I not really understand the way it works?

What do you mean by safe places? Isn't my house/job/parent's(or siblings') house/in-laws' safe enough?

Thanks for the answer. I have clearly not thought this through enough.
I will give it some more thought and make a decision.

Kind of unrelated:
Hypothetically, if I wanted to install a bitcoin ATM in my workplace. How would I go about doing so? 
How much does it cost to buy(?) one rent (?) one or whatever? I am thinking about this as a entrepreneurial endeavor. I work at a big IT place where I suppose many people own bitcoins.

Yes, no, yes.

I have a 2 factor authentication but not the 2nd password.

Thanks for the clear answer. I didn't do any of that, so for the moment they should be safe.
I will be moving them though.

Can someone explain the second part of the video?  I can't quite grasp the concepts of programming a bitcoin.
