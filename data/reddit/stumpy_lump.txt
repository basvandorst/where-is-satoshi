Convert to BTC then fiat, but only if you want to pay huge BTC fees

A fine *less* than the profit they made from that fraud.

[Millions:]( a number between 1,000,000 and 999,999,999, as in referring to an amount of money.
If they used this definition then they potentially made a tiny profit. And maybe they can say $5 billion is just "$5000 million"

Oh nice, that's not bad at all. I've never bought anything using bitcoin, I was assuming the transaction took about as long as it takes coinbase to do a transaction with my bank

That's not bad because Newegg (at least in my state) doesn't charge sales tax. But it would really stink to pay sales tax *and* a bitcoin fee, especially if it takes a week to confirm. Idk, I guess it's hard to grow as quickly as bitcoin has grown and I hope smart people can figure all that out for me

What was the transaction fee?   -real question, plz don't hate me

Judging by the map it looks like 95% is in the US and Europe? The big red circles and arrows make it look more filled in than the heat map itself

China runs bitcoin more than other countries, I think they want to drive prices low so they can buy-in for the long term.

Price increase? The price went *down* since last month
