My rule is never to fucking touch my original BTC stack, I use Fiat-BTC-Alt route when I need to buy alt.

When people have to pay crazy fees, what do you expect? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:02:26
Can I show my crypto balance too:)

Well; I have significant amount of my net worth with TD in different kind of accounts. I am pretty sure TD is very much part of the bitcoin future trading. They just  want to make it difficult for normal people, so they can play the game but you can't not. If they give me shit like that, I will just move all my accounts to other bank. I suggest you stay firm and do the same. It is your money and you can use it as you please unless off course it is not illegal. ... and crypto investments are not illegal yet. In Canada actually there is not even a remote chance that this will happen any time soon (TD is Canadian bank).

I believe you can't withdraw from Gdax if you are in Canada. Can you?

Where are you buying from? I use my TD account/credit card routinely, no issue at all.

While past is no prediction of the future, bitcoin have proven invincible over the years. Sell it and when you realize your mistake, you will come back crying.

You are a genius; )

Wasn't Bitcoin supposed to give normal people a way to buy/sell things without currupt governments? 90% people on the earth live with no value/savings, it is important that they can buy things with this new form of currency. So transaction fees and speed are important, sure the value has to be there in first place to be able to send. Without the speed and low fees, Bitcoin is like a palace, fort, or elephant; lots of value for touristic purposes but  almost useless for normal people.

I am a Canadian and Gemini asked for my SIN number. I don't share that with anybody except my employer or the  government, so I just moved on to Kraken and Quadrigacx  (Canadian exchange).

You clearly have no idea about how much Indians love  their gold.

I am not buying yet, still in red. It will go down, wait for the friday
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:03:50
This is total BS
@_date: 2017-07-13 00:54:35
This is the whole idea, to keep is free from governments. The value fluctuates because it is early days of this technologies, it will stabilize with time.

I am thinking $1000
