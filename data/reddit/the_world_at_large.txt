If Amazon starts to accept bitcoin, I feel like the value will stay above $250

No, you add funds to the wallet first. Otherwise the bot will reject your command.

Honest question guys - is mining subscribers still worth it with my current hardware?

Except that sign is probably more effective

I think this is teaching a lot of people the power of crypto

I didn't say overnight. If you're savvy enough, I'm sure you would probably see the new coin rising. @_date: 2013-12-13 10:19:02
Unless you buy from someone directly, a website like coinbase is the easily method I've found.

I'm sure it will continue to go up as attention grows. I just hope the prices wait til I get my next paycheck to skyrocket again.

What about all the people buying bitcoins for christmas presents?

As you can see, even most people of this forum would recommend against investing that much, unless, as they've said, it is something you could truly afford to lose. It is not inconceivable that a better coin surfaces and completely replaces bitcoin before widespread adoption, perhaps plummeting the value for a long while. The only reason I'd feel comfortable investing that much at this point would be if I was going to be keeping a close eye on the cryptocurrency community.

I'm sorry you got so much hate for having an opinion. I hope you're not right, but I wouldn't have downvoted you, since I couldn't say you're wrong.

You should probably tag that as NSFW

The thing about breakthroughs - you don't usually see them coming.

PM me, I might be able to help you

Considering I was only able to purchase .01, I'm hoping for more like $1,000,000
