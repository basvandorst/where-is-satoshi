It'll still be a straight line, though. Log graphs turn any exponential curve into a straight line; the rate of the exponential becomes the slope of the line.
Since straight lines are easier to read, understand, and analyse, we should always try to change the axes to make the trend we expect into a straight line.

Not an alibi. A proof that you owned the file at a certain time, which might help in a copyright case.
Granted, it's probably more useful for a patent application or a contract. The idea is, by posting only the hash at time T, you can release the entire file at a later time T' and still have ironclad proof that you owned it at T.

I'm not offended, I just think it's strange. All writing is full of wordplay and allusion, and this is a pretty major one. Of course I don't think it's deliberate, but if it's accidental, it still doesn't reflect well on you. At the very least, it shows you didn't put as much thought into the ad as you could have done.

I'm sorry - anti-trust legislation? From the vague impression I've got of your philosophy, I don't see why you would consider that a bad thing. Competition is the only reason why capitalism works, so surely making monopolies illegal should be a good thing?
(Whether those laws get reliably enforced is another question entirely.)


Google, Apple, UPS, and Ikea are supposed to keep their stockholders happy. Politicians are supposed to keep their voters happy. I don't own any stock, but I do have the vote, so what little influence I have on the state of the world goes through that channel. I don't know if you're in the same situation.
A cabal of a few hundred people controlling $2 trillion? The hundred richest CEOs in the world control a comparable amount. You make an interesting point, that companies "rule" the world as much as those who are nominally in charge of countries. There's a worryingly large amount of crossover between the two worlds - directors who become politicians and vice-versa.

"Backdoor" implies a weakness that was deliberately introduced - unlikely and very difficult if the code is open-source. Not the word I'd use.

Right. You can argue that Bitcoin is only cryptographically signed information, or you can argue that it's a currency, or an asset, or something else entirely. Just don't change sides when it's convenient for you - information has no protections other than free speech, and Bitcoin ought to get protections.

I wouldn't call taxation "skimming off the top". I prefer to think of it as "the annual fee for being a citizen of this country". Lots of organisations charge a membership fee, and provide benefits in return. This is little different.
It's not like tax money goes to paying for the MP's expensive swimming pool - well, okay, it does sometimes, but only when something's gone badly wrong. Normally, it goes back to citizens of the country, on services like education and the NHS. Hardly the government lining its own pockets. It benefits those in need of free education or free healthcare, and it creates jobs for the teachers and doctors. And those who pay the cost? Theoretically, the rich, who are less in need of the money. (In practice, the ultra-rich can afford lawyers and accountants to come up with tax dodges, so the comfortably-rich pay the most income tax.)
Same for paved slabs of asphalt. I would not like to pay a toll for using the pavement. People who walk are often those who can't afford cars, and so are not really in a position to pay tolls.

Bitcoin is not backed by anything, it is a medium for backing other things with. You might sign a contract backed by Bitcoin (cryptographically enforced, even - can't do that in dollars!). Eventually we may create currencies backed by Bitcoin.
Similarly, gold isn't backed by anything, it's a medium for backing things with. It's valuable because it's rare and unforgeable - the same things that make Bitcoin valuable.

The time is provided by the block index so timestamps are redundant.
Not sure why you want to store the GPS coordinates separately. Put the coordinates into the image file, then hash the whole thing, and now you can prove that you had that file within 10 minutes of whenever you submitted it to the blockchain.

Excellent point. Still, without central planning, they won't benefit from economies of scale - perhaps that's an acceptable cost.
And there's more to infrastructure than transportation. Who'll maintain the sewer system? Who'll pay the police force? If corrupt cops are a problem today, imagine how bad it would be if the police were a for-profit organisation.
@_date: 2014-11-16 18:56:49
Probably because the money to maintain roads and bridges comes from taxes.
@_date: 2014-11-16 19:36:29
Small, local infrastructure, maybe. But who could afford the billions to build a motorway in tax-free libertarian paradise? And of those who can afford it, who would care to?

The Bitcoin system has become more valuable, but individual bitcoins are declining slightly. They've gone from a high of $1000 in January to $300-400 around this month.
Good news if you've invested in the Bitcoin system - if you work for Paypal or Newegg or your own little alpaca sock business. Bad news if you actually own bitcoins.

You were the one asking why a country's infrastructure would collapse without tax money. I'm just asking you the opposite question: why wouldn't it?

Can they do that? Surely it's the miners' decision whether or not to accept a certain transaction into the next block. And as long as the fees add up, why would they care what people spend their money on?

It's a risk/reward thing. What costs the company more, to pay the 25k, or to take Peter to court and get the contract overturned?
Well, lawyers are expensive, so they'll give him the 25k. If he'd tried to block them from patenting entirely, it would be a different matter.
It's much better than nothing, though!

(364/365)^7000000000 is the number, give or take a bit depending on how the population grows. If you want me to write that number in full, it starts with 0.000000... and then over 8 million more zeroes... and then a 2.

How very British. "Look at our 18th-century gold vault. It has a really huge door that makes a satisfying CLUNK noise when you unlock it with these giant keys. That door might look a little silly, but it is absolutely impregnable.

It's really just so transactions can be tracked better. If two people want to buy your product, but you only receive payment for one, how do you know who to send it to?

The probability of BTC Guild solving any one block is 1/4, because they control 1/4 of the hashing power in the network.  
The probability of them solving any 7 consecutive blocks is 1/16384.  
The probability of them solving any 8 consecutive blocks is 1/65536.  
I'm not sure where you got 1/268435456 from, but it happens to be the probability of them solving any 14 consecutive blocks.

No, don't get back into BTC! For all OP knows, BTC could enter a death spiral next year and never recover. He's proved that he doesn't understand the risks he's taking or the consequences of his actions; why would speculating be any safer than daytrading?

You'd put a really small amount in the wallet, so if someone does hack it you can say "Sorry guys, some lunatic decided it would be worth ruining our fun to steal 0.5 mBTC".
