Yes it's a bad idea, make some paper wallet copies and put them somewhere safe.

The Linux kernel would have been nowhere near as influential if not for the GNU community, but I think that there still would have been some lesser version of GNU operating systems if the Linux kernel was never created. GNU-Linux was the product of a lot of people's hard work.

If the coins move, I think it's much more likely that it's because Satoshi wanted to move them, rather than that someone created a quantum computer and used it to steal them.

In some situations it seems to make sense, or at least it's much harder to implement a better way. For example there is an account where I can do online investing, buying options and that sort of thing. I think that needs my social insurance number and some other information so that I can keep control over my money. If I forget my password or have some security issue I just have to prove that I'm who I say I am and I get access to my money. Same with at the bank, I had some fraudulent transactions made on my account recently, I just have to prove that I'm me and I get control over my money. They are reversing the transactions because I didn't make them. So in addition your proof of identity being using the right password, their security is in the background check of the person. That when when passwords get forgotten or stolen then you don't lose control of your money.
Again it's probably not an ideal system but it's hard to implement a better one.
For other companies you're right. I had my ISP try to get my social insurance number and I turned them down. They argued that it was to prove that someone else wasn't using my account (which is just for wifi, so it's not like they can do much unless they live beside me). I told them I'm more comfortable with someone else using my Internet than using my SIN.

I'm not giving reasons why bitcoin is bad, I'm saying that the network effect on its own is not "pretty darn predictable, as far as nature goes". The network effect on its own isn't a good enough rebuttal to "nobody can accurately predict the price of bitcoin in 6 months".
But I guess I wouldn't expect an essay either.
@_date: 2014-09-21 17:42:03
Some didn't. The underlying reason for them being bad is that unregulated capitalism tends to cause a consolidation of wealth by a relatively small group of people, and those people then fight to maintain their wealth however they can. They hire more goon squads and PMCs because they have more money than everyone else. I think that as a tool they're bad because they tend to be used for bad more than for good, but if there's more reason to believe that they won't be then I could be wrong.

It's irreversible in a similar way that sending cash through the mail is irreversible.

There's a ton of venture capital lying around trying to attach itself to the best opportunity. Bitpay wanted to sell as little of its ownership as it could for as much money as it could (part of the nature of capital), and those venture capitalists wanted to make as much money as they could with the money they had lying around. $30 million doesn't mean that Bitpay needed $30 million, that's the conclusion of the above competing forces. People thought that they would be able to make a lot of money by investing in bitpay so they invested.

I don't think their intentions are to make a free market nor to make a market similar to Silk Road. Their intention is to make money, it's a startup/hackathon/company/venture-seeker made with the purpose of capturing a market. They've decided that this is the easiest way for them to do that. It's money first, not ideology. Comparing it to Silk Road is done to explain the concept for marketing purposes, it is not done for ideological reasons.
If they change the name to "Free Market", they won't do so for ideological reasons, they'd do it for PR reasons. If they ever have the option to steal everyone's money and get away with it without punishment, they probably would. People here seem to forget that ideology is circumstantial in cases like these.

I think it's way simpler and we delude ourselves less if we buy what's cheaper and easier for us, and then donate the difference to a space project, or to a bitcoin-endorsing project, or something else. To say "Oh I'm now more loyal to X store", or "I like company Y because it did Z" is just falling for PR and being irrational.
I understand doing some things as a principle, to try to give a market share to certain groups that otherwise have a tough time competing, that's probably reasonable in some cases. One example is the Free Software Foundation, they encourage using software that is free and open source and basically in the public domain. I think that's a good principle. Even then however, there's no loyalty to specific open source projects (Firefox, Open Office, GNU-Linux), or even to foundations like the FSF, we would just follow those principles because those principles make sense.
What you're suggesting as "indirect way"s to support certain projects are awfully inefficient. If we spend $1.00 at overstock instead of at amazon, that probably gives the bitcoin cause like 0.00001 cents (I made that up but yeah).
If overstock has something cheaper, buy from there. If something costs $100 on overstock and $90 on amazon, buy it from amazon and donate $10 to some pro-bitcoin project, that's way more efficient.

With respect to public key cryptography and the common concept of ownership, I'd imagine that the person who has control over it would own it.

Immense wealth that set them ahead, that they took and invested in other industries, is still banking wealth. Even then, the point isn't the banking industry, it's that once you acquire enough capital, you put it to work for you and it accumulates (unless you make some big mistakes, which happens all the time). From there that wealth (the combined wealth of all the people who are doing this) for the most part runs the world economy, it finds profitable ventures and seeks to exploit them. That notion of investing wealth and lending it out and having it run world finance is what people criticize bankers for, but more-so it's what basically every rich person does with their money. If they have a lot of money in a bank account or in one of many financial instruments then that's what they're doing with their money.
In short: One, his wealth came from banking. Two, and more importantly, once you have that much capital and you put it to work for you, you are so intertwined with banking and the financial world that you're part of the same system of 'evil banking bad guys' in a pretty fundamental way.
Edit: It's actually kind of neat because the venture-capital-driven start-up community is fundamentally similar to the low-cost startup community of the 90's, and the 'go to the bank and get a loan to start a business' of the decades prior, all the way back to merchant banking from I don't know how far back. As a result of progressing technology, wealth is more liquid and it is easier to get an investment, and it's way easier to build something profitable. However, it's still fundamentally capitalists providing wealth to labourers to try to capture a part of a market. That same relationship of capitalists wanting to put their wealth to work, and labourers seeking capital so that they could do something, is still there.

The innovation in bitcoin is the same as the innovation in normal society, it's comparable to other tech start-ups. The innovation in 'the government' is fantastic, it includes basically everything coming out of university research, plus all of the start-ups that come out of university students.


This is debatable. Nowadays, Western society has more than enough to provide for everyone, put due to social pressure and what not, people spend their days at work to make money so they can get by. That cycle pushes rent up and makes people who otherwise would be happy doing what they're doing have to go to work to pay rent. Real estate is a limited market so people can monopolize it and raise rent arbitrarily. Slum lords aren't moral, they're financializing something that doesn't have to be, if they wanted to be moral, they could spend their profit building new building complexes and offering them for low rent. The 'market price' isn't the most moral price for something like rent.


People should run society, the masses should run it. Bitcoin early adopters, and most other very wealthy people, are 'privileged men in suits'. It doesn't make sense for the John Rockefellers and Roger Vers and the Koch Brothers of the world to run society. Letting the chips 'fall as they may' means that, large financial interests running society.

Yeah really. The libertarians of bitcoin that praise it for offering fees below 3% should also be praising Visa/MS for bringing those fees down to 3%.

BIP 38 seems fundamentally flawed to me because then you have to find a way to store the password to the private key.

I don't think that everybody is ridiculing bitcoin investors, I think that's exaggerated. A lot of people are interested and a lot of people are curious and a lot of people don't know about it and a lot of people think it's a bad idea. What we see most are very-pro-bitcoin and very-anti-bitcoin headlines because that's what brings in the most ad revenue. I think any hostility in that sense is exaggerated.
It's like Tesla and electric cars. People have wanted electric cars not just for years, but for decades, the idea has been feasible for decades and people have been waiting for it. However, popular headlines talk about Tesla as some rogue company that has had to endure criticism for having a unique idea or some made up stuff like that.

People seem to mix up 'good' with 'in my personal interest'. Regulation is good, taxes are good when they are spent on worthwhile and important social services. However, if you're personally doing well, they are against your personal interest. I would be better off running a company somewhere with little regulations if it's in my interest to do so, but the fact that I'd be evading taxes means that it's worse for people in general.
It's like saying "if Cuba's so great, why don't you move to Cuba?". Easy, I'd make less money there. However, if the whole world was more like Cuba (some metrics, not everything, I mean stuff like environmental sustainability, healthcare, education, some other stuff) then the world would be better off. That doesn't mean it's in any of our individual interests to move there though.

[According to this]( the top 3% of people own 68.7% of money, for bitcoin the top 1% own 76.21% of bitcoins. More than half of the bitcoins have already been mined so it won't change by much. With money the bottom 70% own 3% of the wealth, with bitcoin the bottom 70% own 1% of the bitcoin.
[According to this]( the top 0.007% of people own more than 25% of the number of bitcoins. If bitcoin is supposed to take off as a major currency then that's an insane distribution.
I'm hoping that maybe new altcoins will jump up and people will move between them in such a way that the wealthiest lose most of their investments. However, rich people can hire analysts to decide on the best altcoins to invest in and when, so if anything they could make even more money from that kind of movement.

Yes they are, there's no reason to think that bitcoin won't be lent out the exact same way cash is.


They can if the existing style of banking takes over with bitcoin instead of cash. You can have fractional reserve lending with bitcoin the same way you can have it with fiat currency.


No they don't, the same way that they don't with cash. The bank doesn't hold enough cash for everyone, they just give IOUs. You can have the exact same IOUs with bitcoin. You can have the exact same credit structure with bitcoin as the underlying currency instead of fiat currency.

Not really, we're too far detached from most of the products we use. If there's some gold mining company in another company contributing to a civil war so that it could get a cheap mining operation then there's little in my purchasing power that can stop it. I don't decide whether companies use that gold, some gold processor does, and they buy the least expensive gold available. Then that gold gets processed and put into various products and eventually it gets into products I buy. If you're suggesting not buying products like that, then I'm out a lot, I wouldn't buy a cell phone because of coltan mining, I would stay away from most cloth and electronics due to child labour and poor working conditions, I'd stay away from a lot of fruit because that market has overthrown governments and still threatens certain areas, I'd be out a lot. If everyone who wanted to use their purchasing power to be moral did that, basically, a handful of people would become social outcasts and all those horrible things would still happen.
Maybe I can get some investigative journalists to expose these companies, but that already happens, they make enough money that they can buy PR, so that's down the drain too.
So if companies have a history of being fine with releasing products that they know are unsafe (medicine, toys, not recalling unsafe cars), and are mainly restricted by government regulation when they are restricted, handing some company control over a strong currency doesn't really make much sense. Their goal is to make money, so they will manipulate the currency and use it to get as much money as it can.

With the exception of Satoshi and Hal Finney (is he in the 1%?) and maybe a few others, they are just rich people who had the free time to read about stuff like bitcoin and enough wealth to invest a sizeable chunk without the risk of losing a significant amount of their wealth.
Then after that they became venture capitalists, which also isn't being creative and innovative, it's just the popular thing to do if you have money and want to use it to make more money. They can even hire others to do all of the necessary research to pick the best startups to invest in.

We have that now




'Natural' lifespan is pretty close to hitting it's peak. A great majority of the increase comes from clean drinking water, enough food to eat, and sanitary living conditions, after that it sort of levels off and stop increasing. There are other valid criticisms of what he was criticizing though and beyond that one point he was pretty much right so I'm being petty.


Better questions: Why is labour coupled with reward? If we didn't want to be the case, how would we do that? The "well what if society magically organized and did it this way itself" is idealism.


People have known this for a long time.


Yes, it is for the people who own the machinery that allows society to provide for everyone with 10 million labourers. They own it, why would they give it up? They have social control because they control all of the food and luxury of the world, they can make everyone else do what they want.
If that situation spontaneously appeared now, our existing legal system says that they own it, so they don't have to give the output to everyone else, and it's in their favour to keep everyone working, even if that just means building statues honouring them. 
Historically, ruling classes haven't voluntarily given up power and control, people have taken it from them, so I imagine that that's what would happen. Then they would establish a new legal system that significantly changes private property rights to mean that you can have private property except when it means that someone isn't fed/clothed/cared for (at this point I'm being very speculative but you get what I'm saying).




Except that we don't


That, and all of the heterodox theory-making he just criticised, is called  idealism. It has serious flaws because it's detached from reality. If they have a solid plan of action of how to implement it, then great, go for it, if it's "what if we all just held hands" then it doesn't really work.
A lot of the time when the author said communism, I think they meant socialism. It was a centrally-planned intermediary stage that was supposed to lead to communism. He's basically also trying to figure out how to get to communism, but I understand if people want to call it something other than communism. He's doing it in an idealistic way though, it's ignoring why things are the way they are. If you ignore that then it's hard to make any real progress. It's also hard to make any real progress if you ignore how to get to the idealistic system that you describe. How to get there is a much bigger issue than trying to imagine a system that works.

I don't, why would I? Everyone should have all the knowledge and power of a God all the time, that would be great.
The reality is that resources are limited, and given the current (and near-future) level of production, some people have a lot at the expense of others. We should try hard to make sure that everyone is provided for and to make sure that most people have the opportunity to succeed if they try hard. Getting the resources to do that means taking it from the affluent. There's more to it of course, looking at incentives and history and material reality, but that's the simplified answer.

It isn't a zero sum game, but bitcoin early adopters aren't innovative moral leaders, they're (I think) mostly people who got lucky, people born privileged who had the free time to read about bitcoin and the discretionary spending to invest a fair chunk without that much concern for losing it. Maybe Satoshi will spend all of the money he/ made on socially progressive projects, but other than that we don't really have any reason to believe that bitcoin early adopters will do anything special.
I don't think that those what-if questions of what rich people will do with their money are productive. We can look at aggregated data on rich people and how they spend their money, if I'm not mistaken a great majority of it is not spend on socially-progressive projects. There are some exceptions here and there that get publicized, but for the most part it's rich people spending money to make more money or wasting it.

These are the same thing though, usually. People take actions to increase their wealth, whether moral or not. The constant competition pushes people out of the bounds of 'moral acting', but the 'moral' actions are mostly taken because that's easy, not because people are moral.
It's like if there were two potential investments: one was developing a more efficient printer, and the other was a company that threatened union organizers to keep wages down. We can take part in one investment or the other but we don't know which, and we can't back out after we've invested. If I end up with the immoral one and you end up with the moral one, it doesn't mean that I'm less moral than you. When people put their money in bank accounts and have it mixed in with hundreds of financial instruments that are detached from them, that's what happens. I mean some people make moral decisions, and that's at the expense of profit, I'm talking about people who invest their money with the intent of making the highest return for the lowest risk. That's 'evil banking capitalists' and that's what the Mellon family does (it's probably also what my pension is invested in, I don't know).


The capitalist's rare and valuable contribution is the fact that they have a bunch of money saved up. Then they decide out of many possible investments, which to invest in to consolidate more wealth. They can also hire people to make this decision for them. People make mistakes but for the most part it tends to mean more wealth consolidation.
I'm not saying they aren't smart people, they probably work very hard, but that's also because a lot of the time they've never had to worry about money or time or most things that most people on the planet have to worry about (I haven't had to worry about that stuff either). They are smart (for the most part) because their parents could afford a high quality education for them, and they are hard-working (for the most part) because of their upbringing. It's a materialist process.

I'm not 100%, but from what I understand they aren't allowed to let the same person transfer more than a certain amount per day ($3000? I don't know).
The facial recognition and/or biometric readers are there to keep track of who is using the machines, so that the same person can't transfer too much money.
I'd imagine this is pretty easy to get through, but I guess it's the best they have so far to stop people from doing shady things.
Also, I think ideally they would delete all of the saved data as soon as they no longer need it (24 hours after they get it), but we can't really trust that they'd actually do that.

Those weren't moral decisions though, and don't really deserve much moral consideration. If any of those people wanted to be ethical, they'd buy something reasonable and cheap, and then just spend money on something ethical. If all those people who spent money on Microsoft cared, we'd be using some open-source alternatives and all those billions would have been spent in more ethical ways. Also, Microsoft had very anti-competitive practices during it's growth, there was little reason to expect it to be in any way a moral company, and it's still debatable whether it is or it isn't.
You can't just trust that some rich people will do good things, then your efficiency is something like ((the salary of the altrustic wealthy people * the percent of the salary they donate * the percent of altrustic people who are profiting from your purchases * how efficiently they choose to spend their money)/(all the profit generated by the stuff you buy)), which is a number much smaller than 1.


Yeah, so if us as individuals did what I recommended above, there would be an order of magnitude more good stuff happening, too bad we can't really rely on most people to do it. Looking at it both from a single-transaction level or in total, what I said above does more good for the world.

I'd guess that it helps their image a lot. If they didn't then they wouldn't get all of this funding. I think it's fair to imagine that a company exists that does almost exactly what this company does except with traditional currency. That company didn't get the press that this company got, so they didn't get the funding and they weren't successful. We're hearing about this one because it got the press that it needed, which is heavily because of their emphasis on bitcoin.
This doesn't completely explain why they pay their workers and suppliers in bitcoin though.
@_date: 2014-06-18 01:14:38

@_date: 2014-07-10 06:25:58
I didn't mean to say that exactly, no. I mean that even though there is a constant development of technology and organizational structure, there is a limited amount of resources at a given time that people have to compete for. If everyone just worked harder, all other things being equal, you could argue that they would then work longer hours and their salaries would go down, and that for the most part things would stay the same. The unemployment rate probably wouldn't change in a good way. Similarly, if everyone's financial wealth increased by 10%, there would be no real increase, only a nominal one.
To pick better words, maybe I should have said "if money didn't resemble a zero sum game". Other than choice of words, what I said stands. You said something suggesting that if everyone saved more and spent their money better, then everyone could be relatively wealthy, but that's not the case, the price of goods and scarce resources changes to reflect the change in spending habits.
@_date: 2014-10-16 23:47:50

Then they would just have high fees on the ATMs. If airport currency exchange is high it's because there's an opportunity to profit there. Ideally businesses would undercut each other until the fair price is offered, but here there is a bigger opportunity to profit if they don't do that. Whoever owns the airport decides on how much to charge. All of the businesses there form a sort of cartel inside the airport, knowing that they make more money that way than if they tried to undercut each other.
In this way the free market leads to exploitation.

@_date: 2014-08-25 21:40:02
I would expect that they're securing their wealth. It isn't certain that bitcoin will keep its value, there are a lot of ways it can fail. Let's say that there's a 90% chance of bitcoin succeeding (which is very generous). If someone made $10 million in bitcoin, it would be in their interest to sell a lot of it over time to secure their wealth. It would mean that there's a 10% chance of their wealth dropping to $0, that's a high chance. If they sell 50% of it, then there's a 90% chance of them keeing $10 million and a 10% chance of their wealth dropping to $5 million, that's okay.
If we're concerned about bitcoin exploding more, then the safe thing to do would still be to convert a lot of it to cash. Having $5 million in bitcoin is still a very large investment, and having 50% of one's assets in one investment is still a very serious commitment.

On top of what said, I think that a lot of customers do want reversibility. Banks and credit card companies provide a number of useful services other than just making it easier to pay for stuff, and I think people would want a lot of those services even if bitcoin was the main currency. For example, a lot of people won't carry more than $200 in cash on them at a time, but if they want they can carry several thousand dollars with a credit card. If they lose their credit card, they can call and cancel and get a new one and it's no big deal. If someone steals it and makes some large purchases before they get a chance to cancel it, they can still get their money back. If someone loads up a bitcoin debit card then they have the same problem as they do with cash, that it can be lost or stolen, so they don't have access to the same kind of risk-free money that they do with a credit card. If they're making a purchase online and send cash in the mail, the person on the other end can just take their cash. If they go through some payment agency, they get the option to get their money back if the person on the other end tries to commit fraud.
Bitcoin should make it easier to pay for things directly without having to go through other agencies, but I think people will still want to use some of the services that credit card companies currently offer.

Edit: Hey you're evoorhees, you should donate a bunch of money to charity, and none of that libertarian stuff.
Edit 2: I've done some research, the [Schistosomiasis Control Initiative]( seems to be one of the most efficient charities in the world. Through it and one or two others you can on average save a life for about $2,300. You're wealthier than me, I can donate a bit but you can do more. You should donate like $230,000 and indirectly save close to a hundred lives, maybe the math is off, but whatever, maybe you'll save fifty. You benefit because people will think you're generous and praise you, when in reality it's just the moral thing to do and you can afford it.
Edit 3: It looks like the estimate for the Against Malaria Foundation is [$3,400 per life]( saved, numbers change and it's hard to be exact, but at under $10,000 it's a bargain, at under $50,000 it's a bargain.

I haven't tried it yet, but as a world class e-commerce experience, I'd recommend keeping features low. If there's a way to make sure the basic functionality works as well as possible, and to have a way for people to code their own features into their own stores, without cluttering the core with imperfect features, then that would be good.
I haven't tried it yet so what I'm saying isn't grounded in anything, but as I understand it has a GUI. I'd recommend having it just send all of the data so that people can build their own GUI's however they like and add them like modules. Then later on you can just add a nice-looking one that someone else created to install as the default.
For every other feature, if it's possible to have other people be able to code them in parallel, rather than rely on you guys to do it, then you should do that. Then you only have to maintain a basic core. I would imagine that the world's biggest e-commerce center would work more as a protocol than a piece of software anyway.
Wherever possible I'm guessing you're already doing that, but I feel the need to say it anyway. I will do more research either way.

I would expect that they are trying to cash in, but that's providing a service and trying to get income, individual actors can contribute and do that. It's more when it becomes a big organized system when it starts to mess with ideology and how people interact with one another. I guess I should preface this with being influenced by my personal preference.
Openbazaar has a whole marketing team behind it. They aren't just making a product for other people to use, they are creating a brand trying to justify that brand with ideology, and pushing it on people, and then those people eat it up and tell their friends about it. They don't say 'an online marketplace', they say "OpenBazaar". When another product comes up that does the exact same thing they say "oh like OpenBazaar? but OpenBazaar is better you know, and I like it because it has been advertised to me".
Now to be honest I'm making assumptions about openbazaar, I don't know their business model, I'm comparing it to a lot of startups that it strongly resembles. That is, it has the same type of advertising, the same style of website (twitter bootstrap, all-on-one-page jquery effect scrolling site), the same type of attitude and style of speaking in the advertisements. That type of startup goes out and gets funding, and then through that funding and through the networking it builds, it buys a lot of hype from the entire industry. Then it tries to become a mainstream brand, even if the service it provides can pretty easily be replaced by something else.

If this thread/subreddit is a discussion on how we're going to get rich from bitcoin then let's keep it to that and not lie to ourselves about the political effect.
The massive appreciation of savings helps early adopters, and given current trends, leads to worst inequality than our current system, in the short term that doesn't help most people.
To clarify, I'm supportive of bitcoin and think that the public ledger + public key cryptography will help make companies and governments be more democratically run. However, in that respect, it makes more sense to praise public key cryptography and to praise the Internet than to praise bitcoin.

I'm sort of butting in here, but would you consider stealing $1 each from 2 million people to be a crime? It doesn't harm or ask another to harm anyone who has harmed or threatened no other, or if it does, it's to a small degree. Money laundering can be seen as involvement in theft of tax revenue, which comes back to people through government services.

Yes there is, capitalism, the same thing that leads to inequality now.

Why don't libertarians understand that the wealthier a person is, the easier it is for them to make money?

I imagine it's easy for you to buy from either Amazon or Overstock whether or not either accepts bitcoin. We are in agreement that bitcoin does some things better than government-issued money and is more reliable in some ways, but ultimately we can shop from either store. If you want to spend your bitcoin you can convert it into CAD/USD/other, easy. There are conversion fees but I doubt people worried about those too much when they bought bitcoin, the volatility in price outweighs the conversion fees.

They definitely aren't as risk-taking and hard-working as all those people who invested small amounts that they could afford to lose.
So, what are you even talking about? I invested a few months after hearing about it, I didn't hear about it earlier because I had to go to school and to work, that took up my free time. The people who I have since talked to who invested before me didn't have day jobs to go to, they were already wealthy and they invested pretty modest amounts, as I did. Now bring in someone who actually doesn't come from a privileged background, what do you expect from them? They're obviously going to find out later and invest less, so what bitcoin does is consolidate wealth and create an inequality that's even worse than what existed before.

They're right though, the traditional "rich get richer" phenomena apply just as much to bitcoin.

The working class was too busy working to get into it or to even care. From what I've gathered, and it's a small sample size, every bitcoin millionaire I've met or heard about has come from that group, which most tech startup people come from and where most current 'new-rich' came from when they were younger.

It's different because a nationalized 'mining pool', or government-run fiat printed money, has checks and balances and is in theory controlled by the people. We elect the people who print our money, we don't have control over bitcoin mining pools if they form a cartel. We could try to boycott them or crash the price of bitcoin, but that's not the same thing, we have a lot less control.
In case an argument comes up about specific to the US about the federal reserve not being public, it's regulated to the point where it's effectively a public institution. You can look at its finances, how much it prints, where the printed money goes, and how much profit it makes. It's heads are appointed by people we elect. Nominally it's private but it's pretty much public.

It does in some ways, it doesn't in other ways. They make strong efforts to teach proper gun safety, and safety for various other situations (car safety, boat safety). That's more for accidents though, if we are talking about conditions that lead to robbery and murder, then yeah again, they strive to fix wealth inequality and make sure people get what they need to get by, so that they don't feel the need to rob and murder. They aren't perfect but the problems are complicated.


That's really not the case though. What you said after uses it as an assumption.


They don't justify wars, they don't justify imperialism. These are different types of issues though. If you can band together enough people and organize them in such a way that the country doesn't go to war, then great. We'd still have some sort of regulation though, and if you get rid of some regulation, then we'd probably still have wars. I'm all for threatening the stability of the government and exposing and democratizing them and putting them in a position where it's very very hard for them to go to war, but I think the underlying reasons that push governments to go to war are different from the ones that push them to regulate effectively.

You gave the network effect as an explanation as to why bitcoin's future is predictable. Maybe the predictability of the future of bitcoin is a nuanced argument with many factors. Maybe the network effect acting in a specific way can be one of those factors, but that's not what you said. "Nobody can accurately predict the price of bitcoin in 6 months" still seems like a pretty reasonable claim.

If people don't care about charity (or making ethical decisions) then they aren't really going to choose which companies they buy products from ethically, so then it's a non-issue, we just recognize that people make irrational decisions as shoppers and/or we recognize that they shouldn't have loyalty to any particular company.
There are two (or sort of three) cases:
If people try to make ethical decisions and wonder whether or not they should have loyalty to any particular company -&gt; They shouldn't have loyalty and they should donate to charity and make ethical decisions when they can
If they don't care -&gt; It doesn't matter because their decisions aren't effected
If they sort of care -&gt; They end up buying from the company with the best marketing/PR department, which is almost necessarily not the ethical company. Again these people are better off doing what I said than doing what you said.
Your comparison between amounts of percentages aren't right. We're talking about individual decisions, in any decision made we weigh out the efficiency, buying from a company and hoping they will spend the profit well is at least an order of magnitude less efficient than donating directly.
Edit: Not that it matters, but I think the data is wrong too, like from measuring what people actually do (again this doesn't matter because the logic didn't make sense). Based on [this table]( and [this table]( it looks like the lower class and the middle class end up giving more than the wealthy, which is how I thought it was.

My point is that he's an investor and engages in startups because he has a lot of money.


My point is also that that's misrepresenting the situation, his success was brought upon him (compared to most people on the planet). Once he got a lot of money, it became easy to make more money. If you don't have a day job and you will succeed even if all of your investments fail, it becomes significantly easier to become a successful investor.

This is hard to listen to because of how badly it misrepresents the criticisms of capitalism. Saying bitcoin hurts capitalism is misguided, I don't think I've heard anyone says that.

You mean make an insurance company that uses bitcoin instead of cash? That's fine but the price of bitcoin isn't stable so it doesn't fix anything. Maybe you're suggesting progressing capitalism and using a decentralised corporation of sorts, but that has nothing to do with bitcoin, people are just waiting until that's feasible. It's basically like what an credit union is to a bank, but for an insurance company. When organizational structures and automation become even more advanced, people can make an insurance company even less centralised and even more open, again that has little to do with bitcoin.

Bitcoin as currency is a slightly more even playing field, people exaggerate its political weight. By no means does it make the playing field significantly more equal, it's a good step in the right direction, and technology and the open-source (open-everything) movement will keep things moving in that direction, but that's it, it doesn't make an even playing field, not even close.
Also the initial unequal distribution doesn't go away as far as we know, those rich people will act like every group of rich people before them, that is, do what they can to keep their wealth.

Why is "you should pay your debts" a precept of free market libertarianism? Creditors paid what they thought was fair given all the data they had, which included the chance that the company would dissolve and not be able to pay them, and the chance that the company was fraudulent. They signed whatever forms to cover what they were comfortable with, and they did it voluntarily. Karpeles did the same thing. They all hire lawyers and spend what they think is right to fight for every dollar they can get, if the outcome decided to be fair is that Karpeles keeps money, then that's how things go, it's deemed fair.

He has to trust that his laptop and/or usb won't break, over time they tend to break. I'm pretty sure that for an external hard drive, the failure rate over, say, 10 years is more than 1%.

That's not how it works nowadays. One thing you can do is buy up a bunch of land. Then you can live off the rent and you will still be making more money than you spend. As long as you're careful you will probably make a lot of money off the land. If you don't want to buy land, get some other limited resource, oil, I don't know. If you don't want to try to monopolize a limited resource, find out what's worth investing in. Invest in startups, military contractors, banks, become a lender and live off interest, there are a long list of ways to keep your wealth. Look for any product, find the cheapest source of labour in the world to make it, and sell it wherever in the world people will pay the most for it.
Then you spend part of your income to live pretty luxuriously, and the rest of your wealth grows.
You can make some argument about some long-term political change that will make this perpetual investing impossible, but that argument is irrelevant of bitcoin.
There's a fundamental difference of views people certain libertarian schools (the Austrian school I think) and mainstream economics and Marxism and basically everyone else. That is, natural monopolies exist, and the nature of capitalism means that wealth gets concentrated, even if whoever is printing money isn't being corrupt.

We're not talking about that though, they were saying that regulations don't break up monopolies, not just that, but that they always lead to monopolies (I accept that that was probably an exaggeration though).


There are serious barriers to entry, not anybody can start their own business and compete. Also it's a big claim to say that customers loved them and that people voted with their money and were happy with them, but I don't feel like discussing that right now.
Whether monopolies are good and whether this particular monopoly should have been broken up are different discussions than the one we were having, and they are long discussions.

I think more dangerously, it allows big companies to do those things at the expense of the people, mostly by allowing them to evade control by the government.

"Non-financial applications" already existed and more are getting applied. Bitcoin is public key cryptography + the public ledger. Public key cryptography has been in use all over the place and is still finding new uses (like bitcoin). I don't know what public ledgers are used for, it's kind of odd to consider it an innovation but I guess it is one.
@_date: 2014-12-03 22:50:46
Wouldn't some people still want a safe place to store their bitcoin, such that they are not liable for errors and robbery and fraud? Also people will probably want to be able to get secured loans. Also, they might want to be able to safely invest their money at a guaranteed rate of return. Banks offer those services, and they can offer those services with bitcoin.
If you think those services will change with the increasing availability of things like crowdfunding, then that's fine, but that's not a result of bitcoin. You can already do that with traditional government-printed money.
@_date: 2014-08-21 22:38:47
On top of that, this stuff will still happen now and then even if all companies used bitcoin. Bitcoin is secure because of public key cryptography. I'm guessing that the UPS systems were also theoretically secure with some mathematically complete cryptographic system. There was some failure in implementation along the way, or some incomplete implementation, so information was stolen. Those rare events would still happen even if everyone used bitcoin, since it's similarly not going to be implemented in a 100% secure way without any possibility of failure.
@_date: 2014-10-21 15:45:48
Yes, it can also be done on a blog though, or through other means. Regardless of what we think they should do, there's a question of whether or not they would decide to publicly disclose their finances. If we think bitcoin will become the major currency in a country, then there's a question of whether that indicates that most transactions can be tracked. If people are able to transfer money anonymously, then the government would probably be better at it, so again, it's a matter of whether they decide to disclose their finances (or if they can be forced to). Eventually I think it will happen, but it's not because of bitcoin specifically.
@_date: 2014-07-11 23:03:00
It isn't a red herring if we are talking about the moral good that is implied with the Bill of Rights. If the Bill of Rights is just something rich people used to pay less taxes, then your argument doesn't matter because the Bill of Rights isn't a good thing. If the Bill of Rights made a positive material impact on the world (which I believe it did), then we have to recognize the history it came out of and all actors at play.
You are treating that historical theorizing as something in a vacuum. You are doing this in two ways. One, that ideologically, the idea of natural rights was an existing one at the time, and that the bill of rights was a small progression in a long history of thought, making your claim of "They were the only ones to contribute anything of value/that worked" wrong. Those theorisers both build on previous work, and actively collaborated with others from all sorts of backgrounds.
In the second way you are treating it as a vacuum is outside of ideas. If I code an awesome web application and it becomes huge, who made it? Who is responsible for it? Not me. I use a web framework, which is built around a programming language, both of which hundreds of people may have made important contributions to. Maybe I use Apache servers or nginx to keep parts of my site online. Outside of software, I get cheap hardware only because there are people living in poor situations to provide me with cheap goods so that I can be chauvinistic. We can ignore this whole second part and stick with just the idea part though, but it should be noted.
Now, even if we treat it in a vacuum, if you look at all of the participants in the writing of the Bill of Rights and the US Constitution, we see a variety of backgrounds. There were federalists, anti-federalists, religious-minded, anti-religious, there were people with varying views on what that early notion of liberty meant. So again what you said is wrong, I mean you can respond by emphasizing that you think that only certain people provided something "of value", but then we can go look into letters that those people wrote to each other and decide on what is valuable and what isn't, and again what you said probably wouldn't be true.
You made a comment in passing and I overreacted to it, people make comments in passing and sometimes those comments are wrong and sometimes they are right, it doesn't matter. This hatred of the chauvinism that seems popular in the online Libertarian movement drove me to read about the history of the Bill of Rights, but I could have done that anyway, I'm wasting my time here.

We learned about public key cryptography in school. I sort of suspected that credit and debit cards would start using public key cryptography in their transactions to prevent the fraud that happens. They use already it to a certain extent, but I was waiting for credit cards to no longer be so susceptible to fraud through stolen credit card numbers.
When I read about bitcoin and how it works, it pretty quickly made sense and I was pretty quickly for the most part on board.


The financial crisis is a relatively small part of it, crises like that happen every decade or so and they have been happening for a long time. I'd say it's more because of the automation and wealth-consolidation that tends to happen through technological progress, and because of globalization.


Not really, all generations are pretty much fundamentally the same. Technology is pretty good now and a lot of people are taught how to use it, so tech startups are easier and therefore more common.


This goes for pretty much any generation
I guess I'm being nitpicky here, but people seem to really overvalue themselves on these boards. People here aren't special and the technological and organizational progress that happens here shouldn't be confused for some moral movement.

This is really cool. If someone made an online distributed market, similar to what openbazaar is trying to make, then that's great, let's review the source code and use it. The cool part is the lower level of advertising. It hasn't been hyped up in the news all the way through its development by investors who are trying to make a return on their investment, and now people don't know how to react.
I hope that this is just as good as openbazaar or better, I guess we'll find out.
In application development there seem to be these two routes. One is just having a good product, and the other is finance-driven. Taking the open-bazaar path, people hype it up in the news constantly and appeal to fake ideals that you see on boards like and people swallow it up and start getting attached to it and get all excited over what's being advertised to them. This advertising is not just to get them to sign on to a product, it actually affects their ideology and gets intimately close to them, it's straight manipulation of people.
Now we have the same product without that fake hype (or maybe they hyped it in some non-English threads, or maybe it's fraudulent, I don't know) and people seem not to know how to react. They should be reacting with the same extreme joy, except even more-so because the program isn't being driven by financiers, but people aren't doing that.
Where's your ideology, people? This is the same product, review the source code and pump it up like you would to products that are advertised to you.

Because venture capitalists are necessarily profit-seeking. If there's an opportunity to financialise something they will push to financialise it, they will insist on keeping control over software and implementing micropayments and doing whatever. It's anti-free-and-open-source.
I'm okay with using venture capitalists as a source of money, but it should be done knowing that that money won't be returned. For example, if someone wants to build some decentralized network, they can go and sell 40% of it to venture capitalists and raise a few million dollars. Then they can decide that they're happy with the amount of money they have and turn control of the company over to people, rather than to venture capitalists (or just make the company not profitable, the point is not to make the network into something that just tries to extract money from people).


Same with pretty much any company ever. That goes for comcast, banks, phone companies, facebook, whatever company is popular to hate (often for good reason). People have issues with those companies for entrenching themselves in a popular network and limiting user options and using their entrenched positions and anti-competitive practices to pull more profit out of consumers than many people think is fair. If you think there's nothing wrong with that then okay, but a lot of people do think there's something wrong with it.

They are doing as much as they think they can get away with to make more money. Any anti-competitive actions aren't because of apple, they are a systemic problem. Those systemic problems should be addressed, apple is just an afterthought.
So here are some things we can do:
As a society we can regulate them (via government), and we can propagandize issues to get society to implement regulations.
We can build competing systems that will take away their money and power and hopefully make it more democratic (e.g. the GNU Project).
We can organize strikes and boycotts, although I don't really have much faith in boycotts.
If they are so elusive and our policy-making institutions are so incompetent then we can be more direct. We can steal products from them. We can take their designs and get manufacturers to make cheaper knock-offs. As long as they are doing something bad that they don't have to do, we can sabotage it until it's no longer profitable for them to do it. There are some PR issues here but oh well.

No it wouldn't. He can take his most recent wallets and sell bitcoin in small amounts over time. People might notice, but it makes complete sense for him to sell it off in small amounts over time.


As I said, it's a pretty reasonable estimate. You can't prove that Bill Gates and Warren Buffet have their wealth, you can't even prove that they exist. That's solipsism though, we can instead make reasonable estimates.


That doesn't make sense, why throw away such an immense amount of wealth? If he sells them off then it's not going to one person, and if it does, then that person had enough money to buy that many anyway. But yeah, why would it go to one person?

As a non-inflationary currency that increases in value as more people buy in, it's fundamentally pretty similar to a pyramid scheme. The people running it don't have harmful intentions (we're pretty sure) and the people running it don't plan to bail as soon as the price reaches a certain point (well, some of the speculators probably are). I think it's accurately described by the 'pyramid' part of pyramid scheme, but not so much but the 'scheme' part. Even then, there probably have been some pyramid schemes where the people behind them honestly believed in the product.

A bunch of people with a lot of bitcoin invest it in a bank. That bank issues IOUs that it lends out to people, whenever people want to get real bitcoin, they go to the bank with their IOUs and get bitcoin. The bank makes interest on those loans. It's the same as it is currently, when you get a loan or send money to someone you often don't get physical cash. The number in your account goes up and the number that signifies how much you owe goes up, no actual cash is exchanged until you withdraw your funds from the bank.

Before regulation was introduced you weren't really sure what you were getting, it could kill you and as long as it was rare enough people took their chances, sometimes people died. Now, at this day and age the world is interconnected enough and technological progress has hit a certain point that if we remove that regulation, we aren't going to see hundreds of thousands of people dying, but companies will be able to put whatever they want in our food and lie to us about it. Now if food quality is terrible, we know that it's terrible, we have the option to buy a better alternative.

The best solutions we have so far are some pretty robust regulations, they have worked pretty well. You can wish for the free market to come up with solutions, but one of the reasons that the regulations exist is because the free market didn't come up with solutions.

There seems to be a misconception about belief where some libertarians call others 'statists'. For the most part, on a long-term theoretical level, a lot of those people aren't 'statists'. The State is both a pragmatic solution to some problems, and something that exists because that's just how things exist now and how things have existed historically. It's not that people got together and decided "Hey let's put power in the hands of few people and give them little oversight", the state formed as a force and enforces certain rules, and people try to mould it to their liking. People don't want a state, they want financial security, food, healthcare, education, etc. So far in history, those have been provided by the state, and most attempts to overthrow the state (overthrow, wither away, replace, disrupt, smash) have failed in the long term.
Where some libertarians talk about how the world could function without the state, various other groups (probably including a lot of libertarians) have actively been trying to get rid of it for over a hundred years. The state doesn't exist because of some religious-fundamentalist movement keeping in place, it just exists and people recognize it exists. Those people that recognize it as a thing aren't 'statists', they just recognize it as a thing, whether they want it to exist or not.
If you're saying that those people who want to get rid of it at some point in the medium-term and/or long-term future aren't statists, then you're putting a lot of people that are often called statists there too, including communists, anarchists, various other types of socialists, and probably Stalin himself, and probably Mao himself.

Cash doesn't have reversible transactions either. I think that similar to how we have a banking and credit layer built on top of regular currencies, they can also use bitcoin. You can have payment providers that use bitcoin as an underlying currency, that ensure a certain amount of money in people's accounts and that charge a premium and that take the hit when a transaction needs to be reversed, similar to how credit card companies reverse transactions. Physical cash isn't exchanged until way after a transaction is made.

You can have some futuristic vision of free market policies and technologies eventually being developed to solve problems, but at almost every step of the way regulation has acted to protect people.

If it's the latter then that makes more sense and that's how the system is supposed to work. In the HSBC money laundering case, I can't find the numbers on how much they were caught laundering right now, but they were fined $1.9 billion. The amount they were caught laundering, if I'm not mistaken, was much smaller than that. Considering their profits are a small fraction of the amount they allowed to be laundered, the 300% fine that drhex2c suggested is far far below what they were actually fined.

You can see it as a utility graph. The most profitable decisions are almost definitely going to be illegal (e.g. extortion, theft, masked by good PR). People aren't going to do that though because people like to think they are moral. People who work for google also like to think they are moral, and they have to worry a lot about their public image.
Now, people like to be moral, so they will stay inside the 'morally okay' level of profit-making decisions. However, when you have so many companies out there, working people as hard as they can get away with to make money, to innovate, and to take market share from each other, there is a lot of competition at the margins. From there, the companies that step outside the moral boundaries get an advantage and tend to win out.
Right now, google maybe has somewhat moral leadership, maybe, I don't know, I haven't heard of them do anything exceptionally brutal, they take part in third-world exploitation and imperialism, but you sort of have to expect them to. In their current situation they have a big advantage and don't have to take that many risks to stay where they are, so they can get away with taking a more 'moral' path. Basically through economies of scale and scope, the network effect, and their immense size, they have all the benefits of monopolies, they're doing alright. If some startup wants to compete with them, the startup would probably be pushed to make more unethical decisions.
So, the current situation for google is okay morally, not great but nothing especially bad. We can look at why that is and it's because of the material circumstances, not because they have some moral leadership, and not because we have any reason to expect their leadership to make moral decisions.
So then google is just another company. If another company was in their shoes and they had good advisers and acted optimally to protect their position, maybe they'd do what google is doing, not because they are moral, but because of profit motives.
Sorry if that was long.

I don't think it's just that, but I agree with you. Once a lot of money is invested into it, they wouldn't trust it to be run by a handful of developers. People with hundreds of millions of dollars invested in bitcoin would happily spend a few thousand to keep it running. Right now, if the developers suddenly die, that causes huge issues. If Github servers get attacked, maybe there would be similar issues. People with a lot of money in it would invest money to keep the system secure.
They would want layers and layers and layers of redundancy and transparency to make it worth the trust.
At that point, as immense wealth is invested and as the system isn't necessarily stable, the State would probably intervene to secure the network. That is something the State should do anyway, but it would probably be lobbied into it, either way it's still probably something that should happen.
My invented metric is this: If the top ten (twenty?) bitcoin developers were murdered overnight, and their github passwords were stolen and modified code was pushed, how would bitcoin fare? Banking is secure from that kind of threat. One, it has a lot of money invested in physical security, and two, even if an extreme attack happens they can respond accordingly wihtout being hit too hard. The people at the top get replaced, fraudulent transactions get undone, whatever.
It bitcoin is to be a major currency then it has to be able to protect itself from an organized threat like that, and I think the State is currently the only organization that is both capable of protecting the network, and is least likely to be corrupted.

You said this:

I explained that libertarians weren't the only ones to contribute anything of value / that worked to the constitution and bill of rights and articles of confederation. The rest of the discussion might as well have been name-calling.
Edit: I feel I should clarify something. There was this post once about having three levels of understanding on a subject, I can't find it right now. It says that in middle school you learn that the American Civil War was about slavery, then in high school you learn that it was about states' rights, and then in college you learn that it was really about slavery. At each step the answer is more complete than before, it's more nuanced and you get a better background on the subject. It explains how people might learn something in school, and then read Howard Zinn and get a very different opinion about history, but it explains that Zinn's work is also incomplete and that in some cases a better understanding of history might in some ways be somewhere in between what's taught in school and what writers like Howard Zinn say. If two people are talking about something and only saying one or two sentences at a time, and someone says that the American Civil War was about slavery, the high-schooler might say "Oh what a rube, this guy doesn't understand anything, he still thinks it's about slavery". That would be not only wrong, but dishonest on the high-schooler's part. If they stick to proper discussion then it becomes clear that the high-schooler is the one with the limited understanding. Now I'm not saying you're the high-schooler, but that's one reason it's wrong to try to dismiss discussion by claiming that you just know better than the other person.

Yeah, you're using anecdotal stories. Do you live in the Western/First world? People in the lower-middle class there and above, which is a certain percent of the world, I don't know, 15%, have the opportunities you have. They tend to have Internet, maybe 4 hours of free time per day (not counting weekends and holidays), ready food and water, and a reasonable public education. So they know basic math, communication, history, understand technology, stuff like that. They also have maybe a few hundred dollars of disposable income if they're careful.
They have a leg up above Third-world peasant farmers, for example. They maybe have no Internet, maybe a similar number of leisure hours per day, maybe they don't have ready food and water. They wouldn't usually have the same understanding of technology and have a relatively weak education. They might have $50 in disposable income, maybe $100, I don't know, I'm making these numbers up, you understand what I'm saying though.
If you have someone who's middle-upper-class, or upper-class, in the Western world, I don't know what percent of the population they are, they have a strong education, Internet, ready food and water. They have enough money that they could probably get away with eight or ten leisure hours per day (not counting weekends and holidays). They probably don't take that time off, but they have the freedom to. They have a strong background in technology. They have maybe $10,000 of disposable income.
Now if you take the same person but born into each of the three backgrounds, how likely is it that they will find out about bitcoin, how much money will they have available to invest in bitcoin, and when do you think they will find out about and understand bitcoin?
Here and there, a handful of third-world peasant farmers might find out about it and invest, a bunch of first-world working-class people will probably make money from it, but for the most part, the already-wealthy will find out soonest and will invest the most. That's the general trend. If you look at the Gini coefficient in a hypothetical thought experiment before and after bitcoin is introduced, it would probably go up.

Watered down content that appeals to the masses and is sensationalistic rises to the top, memes and jokes rise to the top, good content doesn't get upvoted so much.

I agree that it's not a scheme, but it has the structure where the more people get in, the more the early adopters get rewarded. If it does end up being replaced by something else and the value drops, it could have the same kind of crash that Ponzi schemes have. I agree that it's not a pyramid scheme, but I think there are recognizable similarities.

These comments are annoying. Before bitcoin, you could make most of the exact same statements but with the Internet instead of bitcoin.

Why do you have two paragraphs talking about Howard Zinn being wrong? I mentioned him because that other post used him as an example, and that other post used him as an example because it fits the example; he presents a different narrative than what's taught in schools and that people sometimes start to believe his narrative rather than what they were taught in school. That doesn't imply that anything he said was right.


Again, I didn't say there were three levels of understanding, what I was referencing used three as a simplification. You can say a million or infinite, that doesn't matter, using the number three sets up the scenario like induction. In induction, you might say that to get up a ladder, first you put one foot on the ladder and that n=1. Then you go up one step, from n to n+1. That's two steps, but it takes a serious misunderstanding to think that the ladder has two steps. Why are you so hostile about that? You keep accusing me about not understanding something and then you boldly say something that shows that you didn't understand something. I didn't say that there are three levels of understanding, but I referenced a post that used three as part of a way to get a point across.
So now that you've clarified that this


means this:


which you could have said right away, we can then talk about two things. One, that other things and other ideals have done good for people in the U.S. without first requiring bringing harm to other people, and Two, that libertarian ideals often brought harm to other people before bringing the good that they claimed to bring.
I'm hesitant to even say that though, because through this exchange you've changed your argument and shifted your stances and you haven't justified the other points you made. If you consider the two comments before (and the other comments in this thread) to be the conversation then you have shifted your argument and it hardly makes sense to continue. If you don't, then feel free to link me to the rest of the conversation. I feel like if I acted more like you've been acting then I can be attacking you for inconsistency and unjustified stances, and even that's better than attacking you for not being able to understand something.
I'm guessing we don't want to go back and forth with another ten comments before we make any progress. If you feel like saying something like "my rephrased point follows directly from what I said in my first point, you're just stupid", then pretend that I say the same thing, and attack that instead.
Also, as a side point, regarding this:


are you saying that the Eleanor Roosevelt quote was what I was talking about? That Eleanor Roosevelt made that blog post? (or the reddit post, I don't remember which) The post I was referring to used the Civil War as an example, and either the blog post or the conversation around it used Howard Zinn as an example. I was referencing that post so that I could make a different point.
Edit: We've been branching off into different subjects. That doesn't mean we should stop, just that our comments are kind of messy. We can stop for other reasons though.

People here regularly openly advocate for bitcoin, I want them to put their arguments together in a clear format. Saying that advocating for bitcoin is best left to licensed professionals is inconsistent with this subreddit so far. (purposely ignoring "investment")
On the subject of investment you don't have to write anything, that was one example. If qualified professionals want to post their arguments on why people should or shouldn't invest in bitcoin then they can, they don't have to.
I'm not sure what you're suggesting to be honest. People regularly talk about how bitcoin is great, so I was hoping they could outline the reasons why it's great.

Why trust the hardware and the software not to fail? Print paper wallets on high-quality material (e.g. plastic-type paper). Print two or three copies of each wallet and hide them in very safe locations. Try to avoid using passwords so that you're not stuck if you forget or get into an accident. Destroy the data that's not on the paper wallets and then hide the paper wallets. Put them in fire-proof safes, safety deposit boxes, wherever it is safe.

How do you decide which companies you should buy from? Are you just hoping that one of them will have an altruistic CEO? How do you know that once their CEO (or owners or board of directors) changes, that the company's practices won't completely change? Also, how do you find the actually good companies? Most of the ones we hear about and think of as good or moral we only know about because they marketed that image to us. A company can donate a million dollars to an efficient charity (making vaccines or mosquito nets), or it can donate two hundred thousand to some emotional charity (cancer) and spend five hundred thousand advertising that decision. Most people who care would only know about the second company's decision.


People got mad and the company cares about its PR, or it was regulated into doing that, or the owners of the company are so rich that making a moral move and losing money over it doesn't matter much to them. Again, Intel doesn't really deserve much recognition.
If we should actually care about individual companies and have respect for them, then I have another dilemma: Let's say that I can buy a great Microsoft product for $80, or I can buy a discount piece of software for like $60. If I buy the Microsoft product, Bill Gates would get like $2 out of that purchase (this is hypothetical). If I trust Bill Gates' decisions, why don't I just buy the $60 product and then give $20 to Bill Gates directly? I can just send him a cheque instead of wasting money on middleman. That way Bill Gates has more money for stuff that we think he is good for, and Mr. Bezos can maybe spend some of that money on a space business if he feels like it. Why shouldn't we do that? It's more efficient than what you said.
I don't mean Gates' charity either, if his charity is good then we can donate for charitable purposes. Let's say the same thing happens with Amazon, should I just buy cheap products and send a cheque to the CEO, should I buy cheap products and donate the rest to charity, or should I buy premium products for companies that sort of seem moral?

Well that's not happening in Colombia. It's also taking a very long time to happen in India and China, and when wages rise a little the companies then move to other cheaper sources of labour.


You can profit from making and selling something that certain people want and the expense of a larger group of people.
Leftists get the concept just fine (or good ones do, I'm sure plenty don't, people identify with all sorts of labels), a lot of libertarians don't seem to get the concept that there is a reserve army of labour that keeps growing in size as technology advances and as wealth is consolidated. The 'free market' price that they sell their labour is not the price that is fair, it's the price that people can get away with paying them given the current political structure.
When the labourers organize, their collective wages get better, not because the 'fair' price has changed, but because people can't get away with paying them so little any more. People on the other side of the struggle actively make efforts to stop this organising and to keep wages low. Leftists (good ones) understand the idea of self-organization as an efficient mechanism for resource allocation.


Are we agreeing then? If the expensive milk and bread was from a sustainable farm where the animals are kept happy and healthy and fulfilled and whatever, then we should be paying that high price for it, but we don't because we're immoral, we do what's in our competitive self-interest.


Yeah, working class people who haven't been educated on something and who have bad habits will not be good at that thing. People from a different upbringing where they were taught all about it would be good at that thing. That's the reason, not because the second group is a group of hard-working ubermensch who deserve 10 times the salaries.
Saving up and maintaining wealth means denying yourself a lot when your income is a little bit more than you need. Once you're making $80,000 per year and higher, it's a pretty marginal effort, it's pretty easy to save at that point.


Here we can get into real materialist analysis. If money wasn't a zero-sum game and it didn't change value, and products didn't change in value to reflect various other changes in value, then maybe most people would retire with $100k in savings. However, that's not how it works. As they make more money, the cost of goods goes up as well. Some people can become wealthy, but not everyone, most people stay on the margins. It's a pretty weird situation. If everyone's income suddenly went up by $10k/year, we'd notice that rent would also jump up in cost, and so would a few other goods, and soon we'd notice that other than the number, very little has changed.
Who's complaining? My parents came here with nothing too and now they are wealthy, I consider myself pretty wealthy too and I'm young. I probably work as hard as you do. Congratulations on your success, but that kind of thinking allows people to rationalize their circumstances and ignore moral responsibility. I do it myself.
The wealthy people you and I know choose not to have time, they do have time.
The text wall is fine, I think this is a good conversation.

When a business wants to be evil, it's just evil, nothing stops it. Historically people have made government to stop it so businesses work hard on influencing the government and messing with it's ability to regulate.
(Or, new businesses have assisted in changing governments to better secure their property, but that's still just businesses acting to maximize their profits, the government part is sort of just to keep people minimally satisfied so that they can keep doing what they're doing.)

It doesn't need to be valued high to be used, but the price is a good indicator of its success. Since there is a limited supply, a higher price means that more people are using it. That means that there are probably more services built around it and it's easier to use.
It also means that it's probably more liquid. If the price stays around $1 then it's probably pretty obscure and conversion costs between government-issued currency and bitcoin might be high. If the price is $10000 then there are probably a lot of people trading it often, so the margin lost converting it to and from government-issued money would probably be low.

What percent of your net worth is that? Bitcoin is highly speculative even if you're very convinced. Think of startups, sometimes you see some with what seems like a bulletproof business model, a seemingly good implementation, great co-founders, and they get hundreds of millions in venture capital and/or IPOs, and they still fail for various reasons. The reason that's okay is that the hundreds of millions invested in them are spread around thousands of people, or are from a few people worth so much that they can comfortably lose that money.
With bitcoin, even if you're convinced that it's the crypto-currency that will succeed (assuming any crypto-currency will succeed), there is a lot that can go wrong, there are a lot of reasons why it won't succeed. It's not a good idea to put all your eggs in one basket.

Regarding the structure, opinions are usually formed from multiple arguments that are either independent or that support one another or where one relies on the other as a premise. I just want to lay those out in a format where there is a logical structure, rather than people picking stuff to talk about seemingly at random and going on a bunch of tangents, which seems to happen in one-on-one discussions.
If you can logically conclude that "If A and B then C" and you can prove A is true with evidence, and you may or may not be able to prove that B is true, I want to be able to lay it all out so that it's clear. Of course in real life things aren't that simple, but people can make reasonable assumptions.

If you go with a hardware wallet I'd make sure to record the private keys on paper anyway and keep that somewhere safe too. In either case I would make multiple copies and hide them in different safe locations, at the same time without telling people about them (or about the fact that you have a lot of money in cryptocurrencies).
If there's a fire at your house and it destroys your paper wallets then you don't want to lose your coins.
With hardware wallets, you never know if something might  stop working, or water might get on it and break it, or you might accidentally put a magnet beside it and break it, I don't know if that would even affect it but it's good to be safe. They're probably safe but have redundancy either way.

I think people might take the wrong approach in explaining it and make it sound overcomplicated to newcomers. Someone just learning doesn't need to learn about public key cryptography and how the blockchain and mining work when they're just learning about bitcoin. You can explain it as "a form of digital money that solved the problem that other types of digital money had, that is, being able to copy and paste it to make more money, you can't do that with bitcoin". Then based on what they ask you can explain every aspect.

Are you talking about physically inserting something into people's brains, or just principles people should follow? I'm guessing it's the latter based on your non-aggression-principle example. If it's the latter then you're talking about idealistic policies of how people should be, but people aren't that way and they have reasons for violating those principles.
Otherwise you're sort of just taking people learning and interacting with each other in society and making an analogy between that and computer protocols, it doesn't address the existing issues except in an idealistic way, it doesn't properly describe the issues that it's trying to solve either.
For example in your fatal errors statement, people don't disagree and get violent with each other just because they aren't smart enough to agree on a legal way to solve their problems, so you're misrepresenting the reasons people are violent. Because you're misrepresenting the problem, the solution you get in your analogy isn't a good solution to the original problem.
I mean it's cool that you've made this analogy to computer protocols, but it's a big stretch to even make that analogy, let alone to try to suggest solutions to the original problems. If you're just being hypothetical than go for it I guess.

They use it in the same way that they use the categorical imperative in some aspects of their lives, and how they also use utilitarianism in some aspects of their lives. Violence and various world problems don't necessarily come from a failure in people to apply the categorical imperative or some utilitarian theory, they come from all sorts of reasons. It's idealism to require that people voluntarily abide by that set of morals.


You would have to define the human-interaction protocols in a pretty strict way. Someone can argue that we already have something like that through language and learning, but I'm guessing you want something more. Maybe they're some set of habits. Maybe they're something much more rigorous, like how legal precedents and legal definitions have to find ways to handle various complex scenarios. Basically computer protocols and the protocols you're suggesting mean two very different things. Once you define them we have a lot of problems in implementation that don't exist with computers, like having someone follow or even know about them.
And yes I don't expect you to solve all of the world's problems in a few paragraphs

Maybe go and try telling them all the ways that Ethereum is better than OneCoin, and then try telling them a bunch of ways that two or three other altcoins are each better than OneCoin (e.g. namecoin, litecoin, maidsafe, storj). Just expose them to a handful of other altcoins that seem better, and then hopefully that will shake their confidence in OneCoin enough to pull their money out, or to at least think it over. Don't try to get them to invest in any of the altcoins, but maybe being exposed to those other potential 'bitcoin killers' will make them realize that it's not something to count on. I could be wrong but I'm guessing they've read a lot about OneCoin and very little about everything else, or they've only read one-sided dismissals of everything else.
Again, don't get them to invest in other coins, do all this to shake their confidence in it so that they save their money. Another thing that might help is to get actual stories of people who have lost fortunes on these coins and have them read those stories. If they want to invest $1,000-$2,000 then sure, they can afford to lose that, but tens of thousands is extreme and they need to pull most of their money out.

Not really, I mean a lot of groups make a lot of money from government programs, but immense wealth tends to come from monopolizing industries or from the debt of the working class. Historically that's how things have gone. You can argue that the bankers make their money from newly-printed money, but from what I have read a lot more of their income is from interest/usury.
We should start pulling examples though since these are big differences. On one side you have groups like Microsoft, Standard Oil, Carnegie Steel, Wal-mart, Monsanto, that try to monopolize industries, and then you have bankers. To settle the banker question we just have to look at their income. I don't have it handy but I'd imagine a lot more of it comes from interest/usury than from being close to the source of newly-printed money, both now and historically.

In that respect Bitcoin is fiat money. It's not issued by a government but in all other respects it's the same. It can be lent out, people can deposit it in a bank-like firm that would then reinvest those assets. The same multipliers apply, why wouldn't they?

The businesses that accept bitcoin as payment should convert immediately to another type of currency since that's stable and in their interest. If they want to invest in bitcoin, great, but that's a separate decision. Accepting bitcoin is just a way to accept new types of business, such as from bitcoin enthusiasts.

So not having a government allows the reckless coercion of capitalism to wreak havoc on the people. Therefore you need either a party to defend the people or you hope that the people protect themselves on their own. Since large-scale democratic change doesn't seem to happen spontaneously, it either happens when people are horribly oppressed or when lead by smaller party-like groups (basically a combination of both to different degrees), you do sort of need a party to represent the people. It gets tricky.

That ignores all the empty wallets with addresses though, doesn't it? I have a few bitcoin, but I've also accidentally clicked the 'create wallet' button like five times, I have a bunch of empty blank wallets.

If the masses are going to do it, they won't to it all at once, some group will be like "hey everybody let's switch to bitcoin" and then people will go and read about bitcoin and start switching. If it turns out that society will switch to bitcoin, a lot of Wall Street folks would probably switch over first.
If the masses are not going to switch over to bitcoin, the Wall Street folks probably aren't going to do it for similar reasons. In addition to whatever reasons they might want to do it (cheaper/faster trading), they will read the market and act accordingly.
I'm not saying it will happen this way, that's just what I meant by the Wall Street people acting before the masses, but only doing it if the masses are going to do it.

I don't think most wealthy elites would have gone broke. A lot would have, and then other rich people would replace them. I think the rich people who own majority shares of the big banks that would have failed without the bailout consist of a very small percent of America's super-rich.

Not really. Bitcoin has had a lot of fraud and theft over the years. Entire exchanges have shut down and stolen millions of dollars' worth. Millions (hundreds of thousands?) of dollars' worth have been stolen from brain wallets and online wallets and whatever else. Credit card theft and personal identity theft happens regularly and people just live with it. It lowers the confidence in credit cards and bitcoin and whatever else, but ultimately they are both hugely used industries.


It isn't really that much time and effort though, it's like 5 years of work for a billion dollar, or maybe a hundred million dollar payout. Most of us wouldn't get that from putting in hard overtime at work for 5 years. A lot of us put that amount of time into school just to end up finding a job.

1. That's basically wrong, people predict stuff, and a lot of the time there is a measurably good analysis. Most people here are predicting that the price will keep rising fast over the course of this week. Most people here are predicting that in the long term the price of bitcoin will rise even more.
2. Maybe that would mean something if I was a short-term speculator, but I'm not, and it doesn't mean much.
3. I gave what I thought would happen, there are plenty of people much more educated than me who can give a better analysis than I can. How do you learn anything without doing your own research, making your view of reality, and then sharing it with others to refine it?
Regarding your last bit, do you really not see any value in discussion? Like, if I wanted to buy a house to live in, that's a big deal, I would do a lot of research. If I wanted to buy a pair of headphones, same thing, I'd go out and do some research, even if there's less research involved. If I wanted to learn about waterfalls, I'd go out and do research and learn from what people have to say and try to get some good analysis on waterfalls. If you're paying attention to bitcoin, just out of a passing interest, do you not see value in getting an analysis on the current situation and trying to predict what will happen? If not, why are you here? For memes? If it's not for this type of information, then what is it?

No, I was responding to your point about how there is only voluntary interaction or coercion. A lot of people, libertarians and some branch of anarchists, would say that the state is coercion and therefore bad.
I might have misunderstood you though. I'm saying that the way (some/most) governments act could be seen as coercive, but that that's too bad and that it's still better than not having them. People don't like the Bolshevik party because it was violent, but if it wasn't violent then it probably would have lost power. Whether or not we consider that moral is another discussion.
I was saying that the argument of "Oh but that wasn't real communism" isn't a great argument.

Yeah, and I'm supportive of that. Bitcoin with good infrastructure and open-source oversight suggests that no one group can inflate the money supply in the same way that some governments have in the past. Hyperinflation is devastating, so hopefully crypto-currencies will put an end to that in the long term.

Regarding  those societies would just have it wrong. Even if nobody cared for shiny things, you can use gold, you can use it in manufacturing, or in other technologies. It has practical uses, if everyone switched from paying for things in gold to paying for things in fiat currency, or in bitcoin, the value of gold would still be pretty high.
That said, I don't think that is necessary for a currency, it's just something nice to have to reassure people. We can discover new gold which would damage it's value, and we can find cheap substitutes that do what gold is good at doing, so even it isn't permanently valuable.

Let's say a currency deflates at 1% per year, so by hoarding you are basically making 1% per year. If you find an investment with an expected return of 5% per year, you can invest in that and make more money than by hoarding.

It's funny because Lenin predicted this (the second part). The institutions regularly provided by the state will eventually be run by the people until the state dissolves and can no longer be used as a tool for the upper-classes to oppress the working class.
To be clear though, I think there are two big misconceptions here. 1) The cryptographical and virtual freedom that bitcoin provides make it easier for the wealthy to move money around and protect it, it makes it harder to regulate, it ultimately helps them more than the average Joe. 2) I don't think bitcoin will be as anonymous as we make it out to be. All transactions are public, and we can track where money is converted to regular money, databases can be built to link wallets to known sources until bitcoin becomes hard to use discretely (in large numbers anyway). 
On top of that, in the short term all of the services that banks and credit provide are still needed with bitcoin, so banks will still exist, people will still have to pay interest, and the centralized nature of banks will mean that it could still be hard to hide your money from the government.

People it doesn't work like that. Banks would still exist with bitcoin, banks would still provide loans in bitcoin. Land would still be scarce so people would be willing to pay a lot of money for land near cities and other high-demand areas, banks would provide loans so that people could afford that land. Bitcoin doesn't affect stuff like this. If you don't like banks, maybe credit unions will become more popular and maybe they will get better, but bitcoin doesn't address that.

This is silly. If anything, a deregulated crypto-currency gives even more money to the wealthy and powerful. Right now it's easy to track their finances and tax them. With bitcoin that's harder to do, they can move millions without anyone noticing. They can directly fund paramilitaries to shut down strikers or protect their assets, be they natural resources in the ground in land that isn't theirs, or factories that run on slave wages. They can fund ad campaigns on whatever they want and make it seem grass-roots because people wouldn't know where the money is coming from. Entire companies can be liquidated and restructured with little oversight.
I'm supportive of bitcoin, but it's probably something that harms democracy more than it supports it. It provides a service that helps the rich and powerful more than it helps the masses.

Ok cool I was getting jealous even though I know there are a bunch of accounts with 1000s of bitcoin from super early adopters and I shouldn't worry about that.
I agree that trying to play the market is wasteful. We suspect that bitcoin will keep going up, so even if you buy some and the price 'corrects', it will come back up quickly and keep going up. It goes up just about every day so if you wait there's a good chance you will just lose the price you didn't want to buy at.
@_date: 2013-11-21 03:22:36
The 'bubble' was a sharp rise which lead to the rest of us expecting a correction. That correction happened (as far as we know). During the increase price shot up past 650, to 700+, up to 900 at one point, and then dropped down to 500 and then 400, then eventually bounced back up to 550-600, basically what people expected to happen (not that people predicted the exact prices, but we were somewhat confident that the price would bounce around like that).

They wouldn't steal all of it.
They'd steal a noticeable amount, but that's not enough to shake interest. Immense credit card fraud and personal identity theft takes place, people still use it a lot. They can try to steal a billion dollars' worth, and then maybe people would panic in response, then that billion dollars might turn into 997 million dollars, I think it's still worth it from the infiltrators' perspective.


That's too complicated though, there are too many transactions taking place for people to get together and roll back the block chain and then keep going. Chances are a lot of the infiltrators wouldn't even get caught. If they break the system in a way where they can collect private keys for example, they could just steal directly from wallets, the people they steal from wouldn't know who they were being robbed by, they would just know that their money is gone.
@_date: 2013-11-17 03:04:59
It's hard to imagine the security they would have to build up for a loss like that. Right now with a bank you could maybe send money to the wrong place, but the bank can get it back. With bitcoin if you send it to the wrong address it's basically gone forever. People with a lot of wealth will probably have layers of validation, and restrict how much money can be put in each wallet.

Then our food and basic industry gets devastated and masses of people die. I think that's a big issue, and an example of why people being productive and having population growth can be a bad thing.

This looks dangerous, the small-scale transactions that people want to take place in bitcoin don't seem to be popular, people with the wallets that they would use for day-to-day transactions take up &lt;3%. The majority of addresses with 0-0.001 BTC seem useless, like people just bought in for fun and don't plan to use them.
If Bitcoin is supposed to be used by a wide majority, the most used wallets should have ~$100-$1000, right? As in, they should be amounts that are ready for day-to-day spending that would usually be done with a credit card.
Do you know if there is a historical record of the pie chart? If the small wallets aren't taking up a bigger and bigger percent of total bitcoins over time then we might be getting ahead of ourselves and overestimating bitcoin.
Edit: My bad, 28% of all bitcoins are in 10-100 bitcoin wallets, that might be more reasonable, I'm not sure. As long as the small wallets are growing in market size, and more importantly, as long as they're being used productively, and as long as productive use is increasing fast, then we're okay. If not then it's dangerous.

Confidence is shaky anyway, big events take place regularly that shake confidence in bitcoin, but ultimately it will keep going strong. There are enough flaws with credit cards to seriously shake confidence in that system, but we still rely on it immensely.
I'm impressed they rolled it back in 2010, I'm glad they responded well. I'm still not sure if they could still do that though. It's possible for money to be taken and for people not to realize what happened (or who took the money and how) until months later.

Someone could take the version, modify it to have some backdoor exploit, then upload their setup.exe or .msi file to sourceforge or thepiratebay or any hosting site, disguised as a genuine version of the software. People will have to get used to only downloading from trusted sites.

If all of the computers in the world started calculating, can they generate 2.2x10^19 keys in a million years? If some futuristic computers try, would they then be able to?

Good point, I forgot how aggressive certain government departments are at creating their own backdoors. How can the open source community protect itself from the NSA, whatever hacking groups China has, and the rest of the world's governments? The code would have to be as simple as possible and reviewed constantly, and even then they have their ways. What would they do though, steal bitcoins? Maybe they'd try to track people and accounts.
@_date: 2013-11-15 03:19:15
That would be pretty funny.
I'd expect it to keep being volatile for a while, especially for those really optimistic claims of people wanting it to be an alternative to the USD and other big currencies. Until it's securely and primarily serving a productive purpose (whatever that may be) and most bitcoins are being used for that purpose, rather than being held by long-term speculators, bitcoin will probably be somewhat volatile.

Then you could reinvest the stored money in other ventures and pay interest on the account. Then you'd be a bank.

I'm pretty sure debt and interest and usury will still exist and will be just as common with bitcoin as it is with regular money. Banks serve many purposes that will still be necessary with bitcoin. If a credit-union type model becomes popular enough to replace them, and money is spent more democratically, then great, but that's sort of independent of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:22:07
What's the protocol there? Instead of saving a history of all transactions, will they eventually change it to the current record of the public ledger at a certain timestamp plus the history of blockchain transactions since that timestamp? That seems like it would take less space and would be equally effective but I don't know.

Yeah, we need to know how to act. I can give my prediction, that selling is a bad idea even if it's about to 'correct', but I'm not an expert, we need detailed analyses to understand the best way to act.

What would happen in that case? Would you show the price with BTC with the price in mBTC beside it, then eventually switch the focus to mBTC with a small BTC price beside it, then get rid of the BTC price and keep only mBTC?

Write it down somewhere, not on a computer, with a pen and paper on something that won't get damaged. Quadruple check it and maybe make a copy. Also, using a randomly-generated password is probably better, as long as it's recorded. I'd suggest using a password that isn't written down anywhere. Right now there are algorithms running online that attack [brain wallets]( by just trying any phrases the algorithms can find from books, dictionaries, common phrases, poetry, basically anything that has ever been written down.
So, that might be dangerous to use as a password. Therefore you should use something that's randomly generated, but that would be too hard to memorize, so you should write it down (and check it a bunch of times to make sure there are no typos/spelling errors/inaccuracies/anything hard to read).
@_date: 2013-11-14 06:52:44
I assumed it would be broken down further if there was a need for it. Is that not the plan?
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:29:42
What should they do instead, improvise? Preparing statements in advance is a much better way to articulate points. It's much more reliable to plan the best points. Sure the conversation would follow a pre-laid-out structure, but I don't think it's a big deal. If people do their research then the prepared statements will address the most important topics at the time.
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:25:20
I think that's measurably harder though. Don't they need like 1/3 of the miners conspiring together for them to do that?
@_date: 2013-11-22 09:53:14
Neat, you're probably the most qualified person here to answer the question.
I guess one of the main concerns is: How big is the group of people that carefully review the code? In my hypothetical, there would be a bunch of devs working together on this, so one person includes some vulnerability in their code, and then a bunch of other people make it pass peer review. Would other devs still read the code once 15-20 developers have approved it?
Are there enough people who read every single change in the code, in enough detail to catch a potential vulnerability, and who are vocal enough to make sure it gets fixed?
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:16:50
This assumes that the bitcoin coding community is already infiltrated. One person submits code, five others mark it as reviewed and approved. If it takes five years of active work to build the trust, it's still a high payoff.
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:47:42
Too bad those Wall street people are good at speculating and will probably jump in before the masses do, and only if the masses are doing it.
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:05:50
Yeah, and there's a chance it could pass by as a fad.
For example, it puts a lot of power in the open source community, and we aren't yet sure if that's more reliable than a private group that does things in relative secrecy that has an army to protect it. If for some reason a big flaw is found in the development cycle of bitcoin, or if it doesn't catch on for a variety of reasons, then it could become worthless.
I'm not saying it will or even that that's likely, but we have to recognize that things can go differently than we think, things can go poorly for bitcoin, we don't know yet.
Edit: By useless I mean that it will become so rarely used that it isn't practical to try to really pay or anything with it. The mechanics behind it are cool and might be applied elsewhere, I meant from a financial perspective.
@_date: 2013-12-09 00:14:01
It could be written with malice, I'm trusting the open source model of having some people try to make changes and having loads of other (experienced) people check that code before it's put through.
That way, either they have to conspire and work together to be malicious, which I think is hard, or they need some expert hacker to get through the system (which is rare).
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:10:46
Okay, Palestine will get rid of it's nukes and take down it's wall and stop it's settlements and take its army out of Israeli streets and stop building checkpoints on important Israeli roads and stop mass bombing hundreds of people at a time. Now Israel should do it too.

I'm measuring that by watching mild criticism of bitcoin get downvoted to obscurity (not just criticism, suggestions that we should try to be more critical) while circlejerking and the "we're gonna be rich"/"bitcoins are the way of the future" attitude gets upvoted. The positive posts are sometimes right for the wrong reasons and people don't call each other out on it much.
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:49:00
I'm not sure if you read what I posted. This is the equivalent of a regular development update going through, being approved by ~30 expert, trusted coders, and having one line somewhere in maybe hundreds of lines of code that creates an exploit. The code could be as simple as [this]( If enough people catch wind of the error and submit a ticket and keep bugging them about it, the coders go "oh wow good catch" and then put a similar exploit somewhere else and get that approved 30 times. Realistically though, there's a good chance that it would go unnoticed.
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:42:43


Yeah, so here it isn't issued by the government, but it could be regulated by one if it becomes the primary currency. In that case it still operates like a fiat currency.


That's exactly what banks do with regular money, people accept it, that's where those reserve multipliers come from.


I'm pretty sure they do. If people are worried about losing their private keys, they can entrust a bank, similar to how people would often rather deposit money in a bank rather than bury their cash or keep it under their bed or keep it in a safe. It's easier to hide a private key than to hide cash, but it's still risky to keep your entire life savings just lying around. You don't want to forget it, you don't want to forget where it is, you don't want to lose it due to computer error or a fire, but you also don't want someone who breaks into your house to be able to access it.
Banks operate in the same way with cash and with bitcoin. They hold people's money and provide interest for it. They collect money, invest it, and pay part of the returns in interest. Then people with savings keep their savings secure and they get interest.
On top of that, if people want to get loans or try to get investors, then again they require the services of banks. These three (safe-keeping, interest, and loans) are primary bank services, banks provide many other services, but they are worthwhile with basically any currency.
Now, you could make some argument of how banks can be decentralized with the Internet, or how we can use local or international credit unions, but all of those arguments apply to regular cash as much as they apply to bitcoin. You could open up a chequing account and get a credit card with a not-for-profit credit union. Again, the same services apply with both traditional (fiat) currency and with bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:50:55
Other exchanges that have been trusted with millions of dollars have gone down too. I get that it's very unlikely for coinbase to go down or to bail with millions of dollars, but it's a big enough risk that's easy enough to prevent ourselves from that I'd rather trust paper wallets.
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:23:35
As formerly-reliable currencies inflate and lose value and lose trust, people switch to other forms of currency (or even commodities). A lot of people would probably switch to bitcoin. It's like what we hear about Zimbabwe and post-WW1 Germany. Instead of getting wheelbarrows full of cash and buying goods as fast as possible, people would switch over to bitcoin as a more reliable currency.
@_date: 2013-11-12 00:30:52
I disagree, or, it's not really a question of stupidity, just convenience and misunderstanding, and mistrust. The only people who would be harmed would be the people who downloaded it, but that could be huge masses of people. I'm sure there's a way to make it seem legitimate with respect to protocol, for example you could have a rip-off that sends the private key to the creator of the software.
To fix that they'd just have to put a special emphasis on downloading from only certain sources, but it's a concern nevertheless.
@_date: 2013-11-22 10:25:03
They should split it up into multiple wallets, having it all in one place is irresponsible.
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:54:00
Brain wallets are also stolen by algorithms (any variation of anything that's ever been written down is something that can be used in a brute-force attack).
I'd recommend taking money out in small amounts to secure your investment in the very small chance that bitcoin does turn out to be worthless and crash, but even as you take money out in small amounts, most of it would stay there growing in size.
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:41:55
They should split up large amounts over multiple wallets, and force people to retype addresses, and maybe even make it a requirement for the receiving address to 'claim' a transaction before it's made.
This wouldn't be in bitcoin code, but they would be useful features in programs like Armory.
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:45:07
Make a paper wallet, download some reputable program that does it, make it offline, if you want spread the money over a few different paper wallets. Put the paper wallets in a safe place, maybe in a safe or in a bank deposit. Money gets stolen from exchanges, money gets stolen from brain wallets (basically never use brain wallets).
Maybe make two copies of the keys for the paper wallets, but I'm not sure, read up on what the best protocol is. If you have a safe hidden somewhere then maybe keep one copy in the safe and one copy deposited at a bank.

Climate change, unsustainable production in the form of degrading agricultural land, pollution of sources of clean water, unsustainable growth rates, these are reasonable concerns. Malthus is known for those concerns.
OP should have used a different graph, like the number of Internet users over time, or the number of fiat currency users over time.

Debt's also really good for usury, you can put poor people into debt and make a lot of money from them. Bitcoin doesn't get rid of that though, so I'm not sure what OP is talking about.

Yeah but now we have the printing of money that's very hard to counterfeit, and the group that prints the money is protected by an army, and people who even conspire to storm the printing press or counterfeit the money get threatened by that army (or at least a police force).
We have online banking, a lot of finance is done online, and we know that that infrastructure is far from perfect, but we know that it's there and that it reliably supports a whole lot of usage and that for the most part it works. We don't actually know that yet about bitcoin.

Aren't big businesses investing in infrastructure for bitcoin for local transactions though? I mean shops are accepting it, ATMs are popping up, I guess that could be seen as a response to optimism, same with applications that are being developed for it. I feel like more money is being invested into servicing bitcoin though, I guess I'd have to do more research to be able to name an example specifically, but isn't that happening, aren't businesses investing in servicing bitcoin? Isn't the senate having a hearing on it? It seems like a lot of big groups are taking it sort of seriously.

It's understandable that it's fluctuating now, a lot of people are entering the market right now. Do you not think it will level off with respect to volatility?
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:58:48
Yeah you can, it's just like cash. People store cash in banks for a variety of reasons, and those reasons will probably still exist with bitcoin (investment, interest, safe-keeping, etc). People right now are welcome to store their cash in safes or under their bed, like they can with bitcoin, but they trust banks instead. It makes it hard to send money internationally and over great distances, but you can do that with cash too, it just takes longer and costs more money.
@_date: 2013-11-14 06:51:56
Are you sure, is there a simplified calculation you could provide?
Assuming my computer can generate 1 per 5 seconds, that's 17280 in one day. Let's say there are 7 billion computers, that's 120,960,000,000,000. Running for a million years, that's 1.2096x10^20, so there would be a conflict. Is that something to be worried about? Do we just hope that those overlaps aren't a big deal?
I don't know how much computing power there is in the world, I'm assuming that computers can generate pairs much faster than one per five seconds, but my assumption of one computer running per person on the planet is probably wrong. Anyway, in 50 years, maybe we will have that kind of computing power, and maybe the time can be cut down from a million years to a hundred years. Is there any cause for concern?
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:21:34
I think it's too late for mining to be worthwhile.
You can buy them on an exchange or through localbitcoins, but a lot of countries don't have exchanges that service them. If localbitcoins is active in Venezuela then maybe try that, but maybe go with a friend or two and make sure to give them cash when the bitcoins are in your wallet. I think a few people have been robbed when they have went to meet their seller.
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:28:05
Realistically those are two separate decisions. For the sale of your business, you'd want something secure and stable. On top of that, you could have invested in bitcoin, but that's more about hearing about it from that lady, not about selling your business in bitcoin to that lady.
You could have sold your business in cash, or sold it for bitcoin and then immediately converted it to cash, that's one (good) decision. Investing in bitcoin is a different investing decision altogether.
I guess you know that though, just trying to console you a bit.
