Have you found anything out yet? If the exchange hasn't gone through by tomorrow is there any way I can cancel and get my money back????

YEs sorry its a1f6dec-cc52-48e6-bc29-021fbe6b7aa1
the event ID was:
Those numbers came from the transaction complete page and then I got a zip zap payment form which I printed off which had:
Acct # 750102147 Receive code: 9611.
That's all the info I've got, thanks again!

No problem with a delay in support but to not lock in the price at ( or within the guaranteed hour from) the time of the transaction is BS. I should have doubled my money but your snail speed support took forever and I got a week old transaction at current rates. In what way was my transaction "guaranteed" as you website says?
@_date: 2013-03-30 05:26:56
Nope their support blows
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:30:51
Any luck yet?

Can you help me at all?
 Could help me with my order placed on the 27th? Ive emailed and called was asked for more info  (after a 12hour delay,) that was two days ago and haven't heard back since. I am very poor as it is and cannot afford this. I am happy to forward my claim slip or fax a copy of my payment receipt. Please help me out.
