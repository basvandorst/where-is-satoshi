According to the coindesk article on 21 inc. they got intel to make mining chips for them and they predict a mining cost of &lt;$8 per BTC in the future. That article doesn't sound very credible but *if* it is true then the current bitcoin price of ~$240 is not sustainable. It is very bearish and that is why no one has highlighted it at all. This sort of news gets buried by the bitcoin community.

This is incorrect. The protocol does not know anything about price. Difficulty adjusts depending on network hash rate. It does this to maintain an average of 1 block per 10 minutes.

The API still needs some work:
- order_id has to be globally unique that is unique among all order_ids among all your customers gateways. It should only have to be unique for a particular gateway.
- Payment page is titled "A fluffy toy panda". Perhaps add a title variable to the order creation docs so we can set our own title
- Where is the user sent after payment completion? Would be nice if there was some docs about that too.

I disagree. Most of the devs are against any sort of increase. That's my understanding of what's going on.  
I asked for a for/against split because it helps us lay people keep score.

There are two things going on here:
- There was market manipulation and a bubble in late 2013. This led to the price increasing unrealistically.
- ASICs only started coming out in early-mid 2013 so it was still early days in 2014. ASICs are a giant leap forward compared to GPUs for mining. The increased efficiency has led to lower bitcoin prices.

For digital identities you absolutely need a CA. An organization that signs your digital identiy after verifying it's really you. Then that same organization maintains a revocation list. When you are compromised the signature for your public key is revoked and you have to apply for a new one with a fresh key pair.

I said as much the other day:
It's not production ready.
@_date: 2015-05-14 05:40:50






I agree that the production of bitcoins occurs at a fixed rate overall but this isn't about production it's about supply. Demand and supply determine prices and the economic definition of supply is how much people are willing to sell at a given price. Human beings are in charge and they can choose to sell or hold their bitcoins i.e. supply is price elastic. 
Usually when market price falls supply dries up - miners can choose to hold and wait for a price increase. But if a large mining operation is more efficient than others it would be willing to sell even at a lower price. This will drive down prices.

It's not as tough because there are only a few thousand nodes and they are mostly in the western countries. It should be possible to shut those down. Simply siezing them physically is possible. 
Remote attacks must also be possible but it is beyond my knowledge. Sybill attacks maybe? DDoS?

1.That is confusing. Perhaps you can explain it all in the order creation page:
2.Don't see the title variable option here:
3.That's not good enough. We need different URLs per order so we can thank the buyer and provide additional instructions to him. There should be an option to provide a redirect URL per order. Again, same docs page as above.

Yes it does. Satoshi himself said that the price of bitcoin would drift towards cost of production. It's what happens in a free market economy where there is lots of competition. Prices drift towards production cost + a tiny margin. That's why margins are low in commodities where there is very little to differentiate one producer from another.

Joking aside bitcoiners are a small and easily identifiable minority. They already know who we are.
To kill bitcoin they don't necessarily have to go after all bitcoiners. Just shut down the full nodes which are mostly in NA and EU. They could do that easily. They control the earth and that means they control the infrastructure that powers the network.

Difficulty scales with total *network* hash rate not the hash rate of your exceptional intel powered pool. Remember they are the only ones to get intel on board. They have exclusive tech.

I think you have to use pywallet to delete the transaction from the wallet.dat file so that bitcoin core stops trying to broadcast it.

Alt-coin does not mean what you think it means. Alt-coins does not mean currencies that are alternatives to fiat currencies. Alt-coins are bitcoin clones with small changes made. They are cryptocurrencies that are alternatives to bitcoin.
That said you are right that at this point in time bitcoin isn't of much use to people in developed countries. It has uses outside the developed world, but you won't understand it if your outlook is limited to developed countries.

new coin generation is not a small percentage of existing market supply. new coin generation is 10% of all bitcoins mined to date. Most bitcoins are in early adopter's wallets and have never been on an exchange so that 10% has a much larger impact on price than you might think.
@_date: 2015-05-14 05:30:59
They can't. 21 inc is the only one with intel chips at the moment. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 16:02:30
Relative efficiency matters. If they are more efficient than other miners then they can enjoy a larger portion of the network hash rate and handle difficulty increases better (because their cost of production is lower). They can also afford to sell bitcoins at a lower price than their competitors. 
If relative efficiency did not matter we would still be mining with general purpose CPUs. The evolution from CPUs to GPUs to ASICs took place because the system rewards increases in efficiency.
