Bought at 3700$, it dipped 3000k. %20 dipped but i did hodl. If you can't do the same if it ever dips. then you made a wrong choice.
I don't expect any dip either until 16th 2x fork
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:43:22
I'm making money and i don't care.

Bcc is centeralized and when you look at right side of the page it says bitcoin is decentralized.
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:19:36
Back then traders were selling their coins for profit but they're in hodl mode right now because of upcoming fork and they don't wanna miss fork either.  And that's why price doesn't correct itself.
It might not dipped like China FUD at to bring back %45. but %20 is very possible after fork if bearish trends start
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:38:07
There is a such a thing stop loss order if u dont know?
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:35:44
price doesn't correct itself because of the upcoming fork. that's why chart is crazy. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:23:56
When they start to sell after the fork price will drop and even %10 drop will be enough to scare them
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:37:21
For a newcomer like me, i bought at 3700$ and it dropped to 3k.
It was hard for me. but i did hodl. many sodl.
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:47:23
I entered at 4000$ after 5000 ath first time. and people were saying it's going back to 1800$. my first hold and i sold at 7300$.
now it's my time. PANIC PANIC PANIC SELL SELL SELL!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:47:10
After Segwit2x becomes altcoin, you can pay the minimum with selling 2X.
Keep hodling.
I won't because in-life situations. I'll sell all in upcoming days because of i'll double my money in somewhere else
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:59:00
Just because you don't like Bitcoin doesn't mean you can't invest it.
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:24:21
If you look at all altcoins have their peaks at the start.
BCH isn't even 6 months and looks pretty useful for future while bitcoin is like a gold that will get more value every day but not useful. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:38:35
It depends if i'm need in money or if i have money to buy more. Also if there are upcoming forks like this one that will keep bullish trend.
My all in was at 3700 after first time 5000USD ATH. I had money from somewhere and  recently added a little more at 5600$.
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:46:37
But not immediately. They'll make the dip as low as possible.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:17:24
It reached 8100$ in bitfinex. breaking the sell walls at 8000$ took time.
Also in 4hours chart, you can see the rounding bottom. It's generally sign that bearish-to-bullish trend so i expect 8.300-8.400 tomorrow 
@_date: 2017-11-04 04:45:19
The difference now is there is a upcoming fork and good news about Bitcoin which makes demand more while fork makes supply less.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:42:35
nice support u got there lol
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:41:26
I wouldn't even send my father 25k USD if he says i will pay more you each month. Your friend looks like is a ego-maniac and doesn't listen people who have knowledge like you. Hope this will be a good lessson for him.
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:23:01
All newcomers learning cryptocurreny world by bitcoin. Nobody starts with altcoin. Especially news gets more people to the world but you don't learn all crypto space in 1day.
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:24:23
Spend? How? 24 hours confirmation period and high fees? Almost All newcomers are coming bitcoin to make money.
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:47:49
soon? Sellers can't risk selling their coins and buying at higher price while we're only  2 weeks away from the fork
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:29:41
ETH? Put anyhing but to ETH if you want return profit in short preiod of time. 100.000 users on coinbase every day, great news and investors coming to bitcoin(CME Group) and upcoming fork which will keep market going up. You should look at the news and reason why bitcoin is going up at first place. 
After the fork price might drop but it'snot certain because most people and especially newbies might sell their 2x and return to BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:55:12
I got in the community before 5000$ ATH. Everybody was hyping up. I didn't buy. Then i bought at 3700$ even everybody was speculating it will deep 1800$ at 3000$ dip. It bounced. It was my first HODL.
Now lets see if newcomers can't hodl now. Because when it deeps to 5.5k, everybody will want it to dip more.
Everybody who hyped u up that it will go higher will do the opposite when it dips. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:40:02
Price is because of high demand / low supply (because hodling till fork for 2X coins). Not necessarily because of 2X Attackers.
The dip might fear a lot of newbies because when it dipped 3000$ it was 40% comparing to 5000$. Now %40 dip would mean 3000$ lose in value and that's scary to new eyes
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:47:05
All those weak hands will drop the price as they rise now.
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:49:02
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:40:33
Fork will affect the price, B2X's value won't come from nowhere but if people dump 2X coin and buys back BTC it might pump a little or it might pump altcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:39:34
No way, China Ban drove price from 4k to 3k. %25 decrease. with 5k ATH
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:42:28
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:38:15
Upcoming fork makes people want more. Traders won't sell either. that's why correction won't happen until 16th 2x fork.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:51:49
I don't like Core. I don't like Bitcoin Cash either. but i still see more potential in bch.  everybody should do his own research and stop saying other one is bad for god sake
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:26:58
all it takes 1 fud like China to crash %25. (4000$ to 3000$) I watched that LIVE.
Now %25 drop would mean back to 6000$.
and add profit taking from whales after fork. who knows what will happen
@_date: 2017-11-04 04:38:39
good decision sell everyhing to invest something that can lose %80 value in short period of time
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:27:06
I can see your point but you should have considered that altcoins are always carry more risk to bitcoin. Because of large volume, bitcoin can't drop %10,20 every day but altcoins can. That's why i stayed away from them. And Because of limited supply and increasing demand i knew that bitcoin will reach new ATH at some point. like 6000$ in April, now it's 7000$ in november.
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:49:58
I agree. But i only sell or buy when i'm watching the price and big sell of or price spike happens. In that second, i buy or sell btc in my local exchange. Also the upcoming fork doesn't let the correction to happen and that's why price can't be predicted 
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:05:53
6810$ omg
can't decide sell or not to. price should correct but i think that will happen when it reaches 7k
@_date: 2017-11-06 10:40:54
when price was 5000$, that was %10
now its %6.5
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:36:03
FIAT isn't a bad option if you're selling at ATH and buying at next corrections.
I sold at 7400$ and now it's 7070$. Price likely to correct to 6.500-7000k. gonna buy more at the dip
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:11:14
You need to understand first why rise is happening. It's because of good news and especially upcoming fork. Whales are hodling on their bitcoins for 2X coin.
If these days were ordinary days then your move would make a lot of sense. Still, there's no shame in selling @ profit.
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:21:45
Looks like you learned nothing since 2012. What you're saying it's possible to go 0 or infinitite. LOL. Best prediction ever.
If you can't hodl at %20,30 crashes then you don't deserve %40 spikes. People who invest more than they can lose at FOMO will pay the price
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:00:11
No matter what you say, these stupid predictions help bitcoin to rise up. All those newcomers will act upon this news
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:24:08
Correction happened yesterday with %7 to back to 6980 from ATH 7430$. Looks like rally will continue until the fork with little corrections
@_date: 2017-09-11 18:24:09
I guessed that something that happened but didn't ask.
 lol
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:25:53
It's up again, glad that i bought at dip
@_date: 2017-09-02 06:34:35
when it broke record at 4.6k, it came back to 3.8k, i'm expecting it to drop 4k now
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:44:06
i think that proves 3k support is really stronger than expected. It tried to break that price for all day and it bounced to 3.35 in the end
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:37:38
It's simple. When it dips, buy. but not with all your money and more than you can't afford to lose. If it dips more, then buy more. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:25:29
It corrected to 5500$ after hitting 6170., you missed?

@_date: 2017-10-12 12:21:11
it reached 5269$ in bitfinex. 12 days left till fork. ez 6000$
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:23:09
It's about to brake 3000, i can see some support around 2500-2800
@_date: 2017-10-15 11:46:28
price will correct itself eventually , it always did till this day. around %10.
Market is overbought situation right now and it would be normal to see btc around 5000k$, but its hard to predict that if it will go back to down 4000,4500$ unless we see any FUD
@_date: 2017-09-06 16:55:18
bought at top, sold at dip, lost 10$ 1 month ago
now it's revenge time 
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:26:28
it already bounced from 5500$ lol
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:23:35
Actually panic selling is a good thing. But you need to be early.
To avoid cost i sold at 3100-3200$, i did buy @ 4000$. This is my 2 or 3th week in learning bitcoin
Then i came back 3000$
If i sold at earlier around 3500$, i could buy more coin when it was 3000$.
You shouldn't wait too long to sell.
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:35:38
i bought at 3500 and 4000, it dropped to 3000. i don't have a lot of money and i joined with 500$,  it was my first hold period and i did hodl.I'm in long term and  so proud of myself now

I'm new to bitcoin and i bought at 3600 before it hit 3000, i thought 3.6k was dip. i was -100 -200$ but did hodl . firs time in my life. now it's up and i'm so happy. that was a good lesson for me
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:10:34
It wento to 3000 to 3100 in 3 seconds wow
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:42:57
So you always put the money that you can afford to lose? or little much more than that?

The price will correct. I waited when it came to 5000$ and bought at around 4000$, 3600$. Then it dipped to 3000$ and people who bought at 4800$ were shitting themselves and most of them sold.
It's good to invest anytime for long term. But your hands shouldnot be weak
@_date: 2017-10-14 10:00:11
That's what people did when it was 4800$, after 5000$, they needed to learn how to hodl when it dipped 3k.
Many sold because of fear.
I got in at 4000-3600$ range and did hodl. 
Price will correct %10 at least eventually. you should be prepared for that.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:24:16
Probably BTC Gold or some whales getting to bitcoin

people saw what happened with bch and the free money idea was set in their minds. that's why they rushed for btcgold and same is happening with 2x fork
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:10:34
It wento to 3000 to 3100 in 3 seconds wow
@_date: 2017-10-15 04:31:41
That was a also good lesson for me to know always keep some fiat for unexpected dips.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:27:04
accumulation, support growed in 5.6, 5.7k range. pump was expected with upcoming fork.
@_date: 2017-10-23 09:09:48
nice FOMO you have buddy. this kinda threads starts to pop every day now. people who bought at 4800$ sold at 3000$ fearing that it would dip more. and everyone who's saying it'll reach 7k at the end of year will start to say it will dip more when the price corrects.
I waited at 5000$ ath. bought at 3700$ and every day people were opening threads that they bought at 4800$.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:23:42
YES! that's a good way to end my bad day. loving it
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:23:09
