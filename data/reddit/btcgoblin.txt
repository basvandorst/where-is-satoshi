Yes, you just have to show ID, phone use your own wallet (mycelium, etc.), 
Cool tip, limits are set by your phone so if you hit your limit, just start another transaction with a different phone  each phone # is a form of verification which apparently sets limits.  Works the other way around too when withdrawing.

It's OpenBazaar.  I believe vendor name is "BitGirl" or "BTCGirl".

There's a vendor from Venezuela that does really cool BTC stickers.  Cheap and you'd be helping fuel the BTC revolution in Venezuela ;)

I want to say that it's more to raise limits and to withdraw when they come at you with the ID.
You might be able to get away with just using a phone number, even VoiP's work, just be limited. $900 is not that much in BTC world.

I believe MikeTysons BTC wallet is based on whatever Copay is based on, way cooler UI

It's easy kids, buy and sell in the summer, hold in the winter right before spring and taxes, then buy and sell again '-| Come Thanksgiving week.
The pattern has been the same since before Silk Road.

Is there a link on DuoSearch?
@_date: 2017-02-11 10:23:08
I thought that was the idea with BitPay card.
The ability to link bank account to BitPay account and spend BTC or fiat via card, I suppose you can buy BTC instantly if needed when using the card, the exchange between the bank and BitPay happening in the back ground?'

Yeah, I would go with the Bitaccess machines.  
You can get as many coin as you like from them things. 
You just need an HD wallet and as many phone numbers as you please, even VoiP numbers work on it.

Very cool site.
@_date: 2017-02-13 08:10:27
It's going for .005BTC on PopChest.com lol

There's many other ways.
I believe Mycelium has or had a way to do that.
You could also just buy some other coin at something like FortuneJack and trade it swiftly via Shapeshift.io.
