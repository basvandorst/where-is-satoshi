Of course.  All of those things were backed by investment money though, because people with a lot of money were suddenly realizing that just having a vault full of bullion was no longer a wise financial decision.  Up until that time, people had kind of looked wistfully back on the Roman Empire as the peak of western civilization, but the discovery of two new continents made everyone realize that they'd definitively surpassed the Romans as far as their knowledge of the world.
Going back further, Columbus's voyage was undertaken mainly because the Byzantine empire had been taken over by unfriendly Muslims, who were less conducive to allowing Europe to trade with Asia.  So they'd been trying hard to find a new trade route.

It might not sound so bad in theory, but in practice, this results in what's known as "rent-seeking".  That is, if you only invest in sure things, you might buy well-situated property and then rent it out to tenants.  So your wealth grows over time, while your tenants have to work as hard as they can to make ends meet.
This is how things were after the Roman Empire fell, and is what led to feudalism.  The Roman Empire's expansion was fueled by inflation, after all.  They weren't super religious, and when they conquered new areas, the temples that they found were full of gold and silver, and they'd use this to make coins.  So their money supply was able to keep up with their economic growth.  Once the Roman Empire fell, gold and silver drained out of its former states, resulting in deflation and extremely high wealth disparity.

To add to this, do you know what fueled the economic expansion in Europe after 1500?  Inflation.  Spain looted a continent’s worth of gold, imported it to Europe, and subsequently dropped the value of gold considerably over time. Investment in companies like the Dutch East India company ended up being a better deal than keeping your wealth in the form of gold. And thus we have the first limited-liability companies and the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution.

My money is on "aliens doing social psychology experiments on us".  It feels like we're in the middle of that experiment where they taught monkeys to use currency and watched what happened.

Because how the average person *feels* about something is the best indicator of how true it is?  What you're describing is confirmation bias, and nothing more.
The only thing that went up in price in the last year for me was rent.  Everything else stayed the same.  Hell, some of my bills actually went down.

They may only have half of the bitcoins they're supposed to have?  Which would be bad of course, but pretty far from the worst case scenario.  A lot of people in this subreddit are succumbing to the logical fallacy of the false dichotomy.  There's a pretty good possibility that Mt. Gox doesn't have the necessary funds, but that doesn't mean their deficit is 100%.
@_date: 2014-03-26 12:43:31
This is true.  Even law enforcement agencies in the US are rarely all on the same page at any give time.  Various crimes can switch between state, local, and federal, etc.  In any case, doesn't the IRS ruling just mean that BTC are treated the same way as say, stocks or precious metals?  That does make a certain amount of sense.

I was going to do a long monologue as Vizzini from The Princess Bride, about whether it's good news or bad news, but honestly I'm just too depressed right now. :(
@_date: 2014-03-05 19:28:50
At the time, I was trying to get USD out of Mt. Gox, so I had a lot of BTC there for the purposes of selling.  Obviously, that is not something I'm glad I did now.  On the other hand, if Mt. Gox was deliberately making it difficult to withdraw money in order to give their customers the run-around, that's criminal fraud.  We'll see how this plays out.
@_date: 2014-03-05 19:40:29


And that's where you start sounding like a dick.  There are no sides here.  Everyone who lost money regrets their decisions.  But exchanges are necessary, in order to convert BTC to fiat and vice versa.  And every exchange has a certain amount of risk associated with it.
Even holding your own wallet has risks.  Your computer could get a virus, or it could stop working, or someone might hear you talking about all these BTC you have in a local wallet and steal your computer.  Or you store it printed out and someone steals it or you lose it in a fire or flood or something. Lots of people have lost BTC that way, but you don't hear about it in the news much because it's just one person at a time.

Still, there are enough major differences between BTC and say, foreign currencies, that I would have been shocked if they decided to treat it like a currency rather than a commodity.  It's very rare for anyone to make significant amounts of money off of forex transactions, whereas just about everyone currently holding bitcoins has made money on them.  Also, one of the main assumptions underlying the laws governing currencies is that their value is managed by some central bank.  Obviously this isn't the case with BTC, and its value fluctuates wildly.  So from an outsider's perspective, it behaves far more like a commodity than it does like a currency.  Sure, we'd all love it if our bitcoin windfalls were all tax-free, but it's not like the IRS is going to bother with small transactions.
I'm not sure if it's like this in other states, but in New York, you're legally supposed to pay sales tax on everything you buy online over the course of a year.  They have this box that you fill out where you're supposed to add up the total value of stuff that you bought out of state, figure out the sales tax, and pay it.  Almost nobody ever does this, and the state rarely enforces it.  I imagine it'll be the same way with the IRS, in that they won't concern themselves too much with small transactions, but will mostly look for large amounts of capital gains being made in Bitcoin markets.
@_date: 2014-03-26 15:33:48
I don't think so.  Bitcoin was never meant to totally replace traditional fiat currencies.  Its value is as a vehicle for wealth storage and transfer.  When prices are listed in Bitcoins, they'd have to be constantly updated based on the changing value in relation to fiat, so at the point of sale, the BTC has to be converted into USD or EUR or whatever, if only to calculate sale price.  Unless BTC somehow became more stable than the US dollar (it won't), this will continue to be the case.
@_date: 2014-03-28 05:04:54
You're like a seething ball of crazy paranoia there.  Calm down.  Nobody would be stupid enough to steal the majority of his own bank's bitcoins, especially when it's well-established that a lot of criminal enterprises have used Mt. Gox for money laundering.  The dude would have to watch his back for his entire life.  And he's pretty hard to miss.
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:38:04
That wouldn't necessarily mean they're about to fail.  It could have meant they were running into regulatory difficulties or something.  Considering all the paranoid conspiracy theories that tend to go around Bitcoin circles, it's not hard to ignore some of the legitimate concerns along with the crazy.
@_date: 2014-03-26 02:51:23
A gag order seems likely.  Karpeles was deliberately manipulating the price of BTC on Mt. Gox, and was either knowingly or unknowingly involved in large-scale money laundering.  That, combined with the fact that there are quite a few Mt. Gox wallets that have a lot of BTC in them, and Karpeles has said next to nothing on the issue, seems to point in that direction.
@_date: 2014-03-06 06:45:45
Mt. Gox supposedly has somewhere between 1/2 and 1/3 of the assets they're supposed to.  Hopefully we won't lose everything, although we probably will lose the majority of our holdings.

But they want to rub in how much smarter they are than you!  Why would you want to deny them this opportunity?
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:38:38


To be fair, it's uncommon when the value of bitcoin *doesn't* change at least 5% within a day.  At least this has been the case lately.  Fiat currencies are designed to be a stable measure of value, inflating slowly over time.  This holds true for the most part.
@_date: 2014-03-28 04:47:04
That does not mean that everyone who buys during a downturn is a good investor, obviously.
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:26:59
It's too late.  The Bitcoins are gone.  Hindsight is 20/20.  There's no need to rub in how prescient you were by having your BTC in some other exchange.  At this point, it just makes you sound like a dick.
By "you", I mean everyone who implies that anyone who lost money or BTC in Mt. Gox clearly must have been an idiot.  Some of us have full-time jobs, and have had Mt. Gox accounts for years without problems.
Honestly, if the same thing had happened to btc-e, the same people would right now be calling everyone idiots for investing in a company with so little transparency.
Also, even if people had their BTC in multiple locations, it doesn't mean being cut off from their Mt. Gox accounts isn't a huge loss.

I'm starting to wonder if there isn't some truth to the following explanation:
Karpeles may be almost as confused as to what happened as his customers.  We'll see how things play out, but he seems way more like a mediocre programmer/businessman who's in way over his head than he does a lying scumbag.

Probably not actually true.  Japan has laws against unjust enrichment, which would have precluded Mark from being allowed to keep any of the assets:
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:50:35


At Mt. Gox Legal, we've been following this case very closely, and concluded that there was no real chance of Mark or Jed getting to keep the surplus, in part due to Japan's laws regarding unjust enrichment:
Additionally, it looks all but certain that the company will be able to move into civil rehabilitation (Japanese version of chapter 11 bankruptcy) so it seems that creditors will benefit from this after all.
@_date: 2018-04-04 13:31:16
To anyone curious or interested in what creditors have been doing to help move Mt. Gox into civil rehabilitation (Japanese version of chapter 11 bankruptcy), some of us have a website at:
I'd like to thank Mark for doing what he could to try to help, despite a bunch of angry anarcho-capitalists calling for his execution.  That wouldn't be an easy position to be put in, for sure.  Although I can't vouch for his business acumen or programming skills circa 2013, he's certainly learned plenty about Japanese bankruptcy law over the last four years, and has been using this knowledge to help move this whole process forward.  So thanks for not just lawyering up and disappearing, even though that probably would have been easier and less risky.
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:55:16
The Japanese Civil Code is sort of like the US Bill of Rights, but it spells everything out with a lot more detail.  Any outcome could theoretically be appealed based on the fact that it contradicts Article 703 of the Japanese Civil Code.
The alternative to civil rehabilitation would probably be to have a court decide the best distribution plan, but the surplus would never go to Mark, since any court would have to abide by Article 703 when drafting a distribution plan.  The trouble with this is that it could easily take another decade, hence the push for civil rehabilitation.

Probably.  It's easy enough to generate new Bitcoin addresses that an attacker could have multiple addresses set up, and replace them based on some sort of pattern-matching algorithm.
