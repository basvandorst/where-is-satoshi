I had a feeling you guys would come through. Mistakes happen, but your actions during this crisis have been honorable and you'll be keeping my business. Thank you for the open communication and the dedication to making this right. Let's make some money!

LOL, shill? You're a meathead. Things could have been worse and they weren't because instead of bailing their instinct seems to have been to pay for the loss. They will answer the questions in time... when they have the answers. Or is your logic chip faulty?

Well, if I lose everything I've built over 2.5 years there will be serious hell to pay. To me "socializing" losses is the ONLY fair way to go, and this is coming from someone who hasn't seen if their balance was affected or not.

I think too many people online just suffer from unreasonable asshole syndrome. No time for you guys. Don't forget to take your blood pressure meds.

Why don't you fuck off, mind your own business, and make a post saying what you'd like to say. I meant what I said, I don't agree with your take on it, and I don't have time to argue as to why. Move along son.

You only slept for three hours? You beast!
My assumption is that they'll socialize the losses and repay the difference over time, or they'll pay off the hacker and get most of the BTC back. Either way, I think it just means some downtime for my bankroll, but I don't think I'll lose everything. Maybe we all need to take a vacation while the weather is nice.

All you're doing is making it take longer by trying to add more to their plate that has nothing to do with solving the issue. People need to stop asking the same damned questions, bitching about things that can't be dealt with yet, and asking for information that isn't available. Just wait for them to open the damned site and we'll all get to the end of this.

I hope you'll announce whether the losses will be split before reopening the site to avoid needless hope or heart attacks. I have no idea if mine were among the stolen and I'm not sure I want to know before I know how things will be split and repaid.
Can you tell us what percentage of BTC was stolen?

How could he be sure he'd be allowed to take his cut and cash it out without criminal repercussions?

Down 35 since I posted. I take your downvotes as a contrarian indicator ;)

Now it's at 690. Buy at 542 on the Bitstamp chart.

You're about to see another drop. Buy at 542 on the Bitstamp chart.
@_date: 2013-12-17 10:53:47
Sell now. Rebuy as close to 542 on the Bitstamp chart as you're comfortable cutting it.
