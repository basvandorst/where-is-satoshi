You can also use the Bash shell to calculate your private key from a passphrase - 
Since it's only four lines of code, easy to review.

Same algorithm - "correct horse battery staple" works after bug fix.. same as [brainwallet.org] (
NOW I know why those variable expansions always have quotes around them :)
Thanks for the feedback!

Correct. For example, consider the passphrase "hello world". We can calculate the private key as 5KDtreMojMGybkQngM9MVY7GhAygvx7iZjL7dbcjQjrcMeULjWZ
If we paste our secret key into  we find the bitcoin address for that secret key is 1CS8g7nwaxPPprb4vqcTVdLCuCRirsbsMb. (Of course we could paste in the passphrase there too.)
If we now paste the calculated bitcoin address into  the address exists!!!! 
We therefore know the passphrase "hello world" is coupled to a real bitcoin address. FYI, the balance is zero - paste the bitcoin address into blockchain.info &amp; check for yourself.
Edit: This guy did all the work already: ["hello world" is a bad passphrase] (
