yes but it's 666 and 420.
@_date: 2016-08-04 09:28:31
Agreed. Season 1, while good, was fight club.  Not sure what the hell is happening now in Season 2, but it ain't great.
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:13:43
Sounds like they haven't decided yet how to handle this while trying to keep their options open.
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:54:10
Yes, bitcoin price looks completely unaffected.
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:59:43
The problem is the current main use of bitcoins is speculation on exchanges.  If everyone took your advice it would be worth a fraction of what it is and these subreddits would be dead. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:51:03
Yeah, I was referring to using exchanges in general.  Obviously not a good idea to store on an exchange for "no particular reason" as OP said.  But you can't really say that's the majority of funds on an exchange just because it isn't traded in a 24 hr period.  Anyway, if someone expects traders to move all their funds off exchanges every time they go 24 hrs without a trade you wouldn't have much of a market.

how decentralized/centralized is the separate data structure compared to original blockchain?
@_date: 2016-03-11 01:12:39
Yeah I got this, and I did it because it was their site. Hope it was legit.

If he wasn't enjoying this just a little Vitalik wouldn't be human... after that shitstorm of abuse he took from bitcoiners during the hard fork.
@_date: 2016-01-15 05:15:35
When it comes to crypto just assume everything is a scam.
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:50:54
Yeah I'm sure they're the special humans who resist profit.. shit they're practically saints.. total coincidence that they've all gotten filthy rich off bitcoin lol.. you guys with your teams and your dogmatism and your total inability to see your own biases is pure entertainment.. keep it up.

Okay but what's the business model then of blockstream? They are open sourcing it but also collecting fees?
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:56:51
been wondering when they were gonna go after the miners
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:53:25
Yeah, that and isn't it more centralized.. I thought that was the whole point, that core is monetizing LN.

Institutional shorters bout to get rekt
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:04:07
It's true, if ever those coins were gonna move, it could be under this scenario.
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:00:13
and how does LN avoid AML laws.
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:47:48
comedy gold!! lol
@_date: 2016-01-25 05:47:51
such a philanthropist lol
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:23:17
yes, I remember hearing the same thing about btc many years ago.
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:11:53
Of course it's about money.  For both sides, money and power.  Same shit since the dawn of time.
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:12:32
Very cool! I may try something like this myself.  Dumb question, but I'm assuming the design is for the fan to pull the air up and out of the case (rather than blowing down into the funnel and onto the board).  Or maybe it doesn't matter?
@_date: 2017-01-06 18:33:42
except it was timed to cap the price, like before, and like it will be again if ATH is breached again.

If you think Craig Wright is Satoshi you're already lost.
@_date: 2016-02-14 13:13:31
I've seen his webcasts.. he gets asked about bitcoin all the time.. he doesn't know anything about bitcoin nor does he care.
@_date: 2017-04-07 12:27:33
yeah, but have you tried investigating tether? talk about byzantine. Most likely intentionally for reasons we aren't supposed to know. 
@_date: 2016-02-26 14:27:02
What a confusing mess. If we filed this, are we supposed to take some kind of action now?
@_date: 2016-02-27 01:03:53
THANK YOU! this post clarifies it all for me -- my claim hasn't been decided yet.  
@_date: 2017-04-08 20:04:56
they always win in the end
@_date: 2017-04-22 14:31:12
That $300 million figure is about as real as Tether USD.
@_date: 2017-04-28 10:34:02


Yes, and also you will be able to manipulate the bfx market price as well for additional gains.  
@_date: 2017-04-07 03:58:57
Meanwhile many of those listed are up hundreds of percent over the last months/weeks. Fairly disingenuous post to support the narrative. 
@_date: 2016-02-26 19:50:17
I click on "List of acceptance or rejection for all claiments" and it says "The server could not be contacted or returned an error. This could be due to very high traffic, network issues or ongoing maintenance. Please try again later."
I don't see anything else to click to indicate the status of my claim.
@_date: 2017-09-16 05:34:14
I suspect the majority of them sign up and don't do anything else.
@_date: 2017-10-27 05:50:47
what a dumbass
@_date: 2017-09-16 05:41:33
Way too many assumptions to get a useful estimate imo.  Total user additions from other exchanges per day could be less than coinbase for all we know.  Coinbase is one of the few seemingly fully compliant exchanges.  Not to mention the fact that many users signing up to coinbase could be signing up on multiple exchanges. Plus my guess is the majority of new users put down zero dollars each, since I believe they have heavily incentivised new account sign ups with free money.
Like glurp said, a fraction of the amount you estimated could pump the market far higher than 0.5%
@_date: 2017-10-17 19:41:23
These are excellent points and I as well have thought quite a lot about this situation.  The reason they aren't replying to your point is probably because it is so difficult to explain how the bitcoin holy bible emphasizes removing trusted 3rd parties and yet the entire network has anchored its trust in ~5-10% of coins being controlled by one party with unknown intentions.  
Unlike many I don't think we've heard the last about this.
@_date: 2017-05-01 23:34:34
bingo, we have a winner
@_date: 2016-05-18 17:53:24
Like you said, I'd think it'd be very efficient at converting electricity into heat, I guess the issue would be can it distribute that heat as well as the baseboard heaters (which I'm not that familiar with).  Other issues might be ease of operation and noise, although I guess you could fit a miner with custom fans, etc.
How fast does small scale bitcoin mining equipment becoming outdated these days?

I never understood how Gavin could fall for CW.  I always figured he was intentionally trying to muddy the waters at the behest of the *real* Satoshi (not CW).
@_date: 2016-05-03 20:34:28
Well said.  For those who feel insecure about their life history / resume he really is an inspiration.  There are always people willing to give you a second, third, etc chance in life.  I get a similar feeling when I think about George Bush following a personal failure (i.e., at least I didn't destroy the middle east, kill hundreds of thousands of people, etc).
@_date: 2017-05-01 23:33:40
yeah cause they have no other choice though. It's an artificial choice.
@_date: 2016-05-03 08:50:49
Makes sense. Lots of people would claim to be Satoshi for $54 million.
@_date: 2016-05-29 02:57:22
Haven't seen a spread like this since Gox.
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:10:48
You could set up a foundation whose only purpose is to maintain a metric that indicates BTC is the most valuable network.
