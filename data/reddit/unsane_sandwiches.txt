I don’t really consider them drawbacks, but you can’t buy with a credit card, and I think you can only do limit orders if you want no fee.
I would suggest always using limit orders anyway even if it isn’t fee-less.

Yep, the caveat being that you can’t buy “immediately” at the market price.  You need to set your limit price at least slightly below the market price (when limit buying—slightly above market price when limit selling)

I understand your overall point, but the fact that this is Warren Buffett--rather than any number of other old rich guys--matters. Significantly.
The guy is as sharp as a tack. He certainly has the ability to understand how Bitcoin works if he chose to investigate.  Whether he actually has and is speaking without agenda here is uncertain.
Of course he could be wrong, but he's an absolute financial genius with insane amounts of inside information and near constant deep level thinking/action in it for decades.  
Don't toss his opinion away entirely!

It means buying at regular time intervals (once a month, once a quarter, once a year etc) and holding.  You are buying at various prices both higher and lower.
You are averaging the cost of your bitcoin purchases so that you aren't all in at a risky price.  It should reduce your volatility assuming you believe the price will be greater in the long term.

@_date: 2017-09-19 19:39:00
I feel like 90% of responders don't understand that while you could potentially hide your Bitcoin from the government with the right know-how, he implications of making it illegal would be huge.
This is 100% true.  You could hide and continue to use and trade Bitcoins with the right pre-cautions.
Yes, you can smuggle drugs, give back-alley blow jobs for gold bullion, or any number of illegal trades, but the average person isn't going to break the law like that, especially with the majority of their hard earned value-store.
I completely believe in Bitcoin, but it would be devastating for the US to ban Bitcoin, especially within the next couple years before it has any mainstream foothold.
I think people are deluding themselves if they think otherwise.  I personally hope the US regulates the markets, allows Bitcoin ETFs etc, but don't put it past The Man to put a huge stamp down on this if necessary.
Just my opinion.

Of course he could be wrong, but if it's his true, informed and agenda-less opinion, it would make me weary to go too bullish.
He definitely has the ability to understand the principles of the system far deeper than the average person.  Whether he's really looked into Bitcoin seriously is another matter altogether.

@_date: 2017-09-04 17:09:06
There have only been approx. 180 days in the past 6 months, thus, approx 90 2-day periods.
Therefore, even if every 2 days over the past 6 months, Bitcoin lost a week's worth of value, then it could only have happened a maximum of 90 times.
This, however, would also be impossible, because there would be no "1-week gains" to be wiped out, since it would have to be losing value constantly every 2 days.
So instead, we would need to look at a week of gains + the 2-day correction.
This 9-day period (7 day gain, 2 day erasure of gain) could only happen a maximum of 20 times during a 6 month (180 day) period.  That would also mean Bitcoin's price would be exactly even with its price 6 months ago.
So basically, you are completely full of shit.
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:12:48
Agreed; I might have been being too harsh on him especially since I thought that there were over 17 million Bitcoin mined already.

It's all speculation, but I would bet it goes down further.
It does have some surprisingly good support @ $3500 this morning.  I thought when the US woke up it would get slaughtered.

Why? It was at those prices within the last 2 months.

Yeah and the OP's reeks of regret because he literally could have become a millionaire in that time frame off of a rather modest investment.
His point of view is most likely true though.  Although, I think $100k investment could definitely get there with the right patience (both buy &amp; sell)

Pretty cool.  This is for Bic Camera which is kind of like a Japanese Best Buy but with a wider range of goods.
it also says you can use Bitcoin for purchases up to 100,000 Yen (approx. $1000 USD)

I'd wait and not buy above $3k.  
Just my opinion, gl!

Bitcoin hit $1100 in November 2013 and dipped to around $200.  It didn't climb back to $1100 until February 2017.
So around 39 months or so, potentially.

I found it interesting that Brian Rast (one of the players on the show) was talking so confidently about Bitcoin and he said there are only 16 million of them (in regard to the limited supply).  He also thought that there was already a Bitcoin ETF.
I've only been seriously researching cryptocurrency for a couple of weeks, and these are like 2 of the most basic underlying points and questions I had.
So he was basically hyping up Bitcoin or trying to name drop it, and ended up looking slightly foolish, imo.
It's just weird to me as he was HS valedictorian, Stanford math major (drop out because of making big $$$ at poker, and a super analytical high-stakes poker genius.  Talking out your ass is still talking out your ass I guess.
