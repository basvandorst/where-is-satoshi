I think so. I've diversified into different ways I can spend BTC: NFC cards, Paper Wallets, and am Android app. Also, some of my long-term investments, are BTC. I do believe, however, the best way to support is to actively use BTC in your day-to-day spending. I try to find services or goods that support the community, and choose them over others.

The beginning of GalNet. What a time to be alive!

That was my first step but I wanted a more human and personal response.

I was seriously considering this place. Pharms are easy to get prescribed and shipped online so why not mj? How'd it go?

I've done cloud mining through cex.io and btcguild. I bought most of my Ghs through eBay. Once you get going the biggest thing you notice immediately is how much the maintenance fee is. Granted, if I had to run 56Ghs on my own electricity, not to mention occasionally replacing equipment, it would likely be about the same. But buy Bitcoin! Spend Bitcoin! Support the community by not only putting some dollars into owning Bitcoin; but by spending them and in-turn helping increase the value. Keep in mind that mining will end eventually.

We use the Android Bitcoin app and invest that into cloud mining through cex.io

I actually have the same setup. Cex and btcguild. I have always gotten more at btcguild.

It's encouraged to do so. Once you've password protected them of course. Send them to different emails, your friends emails, thumb drives, anywhere you can think of. Don't be that guy in the U.K. searching through landfills for his old hard drive with millions of pounds worth of BTC because he didn't have a single back up on hand.

Use cold storage (a wallet on an offline device like an old netbook) and transfer what you want to spend only when you use it to another device. I have paper wallets in 0.1 btc amounts, as well as an offline wallet. I typically transfer to my android wallet when I want to spend. I also receive to my android wallet, then transfer to cold storage or more paper wallets.

I'm on cex.io and have steady earnings. I have several hundred ghs though so maybe the problem is with low hash rates.
@_date: 2016-01-14 18:34:41
I still use it. Sorry if I made you think otherwise. The only downside is there's not a huge variety of items. I have listed things for sale on it also.

I've used Bitify for a while. Used to go by another name but good site. Similar to eBay.

Buy a cheap USB hard drive dock on eBay. Take the back panel off the old laptop. Remove maybe 4 screws and the mounting bracket from the old hard drive. Install in USB dock and pull the data to your computer. If the hard drive won't read, there are services that can open/repair the internal components, but don't tell them why you need it.

There's the Bitcoin wallet app on Android. I'd move it to cold storage after accepting payment.

The fact that Warren Buffet has suggested %10-%15 of your portfolio should be in Bitcoin should have swayed them.

Should Bitcoin be considered a commodity or speculative stock? In this respect there should be minimal tax and oversight just as we have on Wall Street. Already there are exchanges with tickers constantly running and enabling currency exchanges in multiple cryptocurrencies. These currencies represent an empowerment and non-state controlled option for every individual. Also, would the U.S. ever consider accepting BitCoins as legal tender, much like other countries use the U.S. dollar as their primary currency? This could tie into an abolishment of the Fed and a new way to back our currency, publicly owned.
