One of the few positive comments so far on this AMA...and I agree with you.  There are obvious growing pains, and Gox (and others) are going through them now.  We will have a much better Bitcoin ecosystem because of it.

Dollar-cost average.  Put in the same dollar amount every week or every paycheck.  That'll spread out the average price you pay per bitcoin.  
@_date: 2013-07-06 02:18:00
There are two things you can do with bitcoins.  You can save them.  Or you can spend them.  I am opting to save bitcoins because I would rather offload my fiat than my bitcoins.  Eventually, that will change.

While it might reduce your profitability, would you support the addition of more exchanges to the bitcoin economy?
@_date: 2013-04-16 12:21:45
I agree with your analysis.  As a borrower, I would not want to borrow in bitcoins, and have to pay back in bitcoins (as the amt I would pay back would be much higher in dollar terms due to the deflationary nature of bitcoins).
Perhaps what could occur is more equity investments (stock).  Namely, I invest my bitcoins in the equity of a business and participate in the upside, and perhaps get paid dividends.  The benefit of bitcoins is that there is less barrier to entry and less regulatory issues if someone wants to make an equity investment in a business.  More crowdfunding can occur a la kickstarter, but without them taking a huge cut or without any border issues.  The flip-side to that is a need for confirmation that the business is sound and the owners are legitimate (i.e. auditors, etc).  That will come in time I believe.
Edit: I do not mean to say that borrowers will *never* borrow in bitcoins.  Just not at the moment.  As more sections of the world economy move to bitcoins and it achieves larger adoption, then loans will resemble the 100% gold systems that have occurred throughout history.

Ah.  I was under the impression that the mining was really just the miners solving puzzles that continued to get harder and harder.  I didn't really think of where these puzzles came from.  What you're saying is that the puzzles are actually created by transactions done within the system?  
@_date: 2013-06-29 11:32:11
The banks have become big and consolidated by design and with massive help from the state. With the government (FDIC, Fed, etc) guaranteeing deposits and being a permanent lender of last resort, banks can lend out money on a fractional reserve. This allows them to reap enormous profits. Those profits are used to swallow up smaller banks, in an ongoing consolidation process.
Bitcoin eliminates this because fractional reserve banking, while possible, is extremely unlikely. 
Breaking up the banks will only happen in any real sense if the government-created privilege of fractional reserve banking is removed. That would require eliminating "deposit insurance" and the fed in its capacity as a lender of last resort. Once these benefits are removed, banks will have to stand on their own merit and soundness. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:45:21
I predict it will include Keynesian fallacies about how the money supply isn't "flexible," therefore it is a bad idea.  I also predict a "flaw" being that it cannot be regulated or "insured" by the state.  I'd be quite surprised if they even highlight the beauty of mining and how the miners are, in solving difficult puzzles, actually cleaning up the blockchain ledger.
@_date: 2013-04-15 15:07:09
Hah! Come on now.  The Fed is not going to stop QE.  Ever.  Japan doubling their monetary base in 2 years?  Their QE program is 75% the size of the Feds (and Japan is 1/3 the size of the US economy!).  
The gold plunge is due to this: 
tl;dr on the above link: Large banks with risk requirements were forced to have a margin-call-like effect on their balance sheets, forcing them to sell assets and raise cash as the implied vol on Japanese debt skyrocketed.  The gold drop is due to forced liquidations by big players, followed by stops and technical levels being breached.  The weak hands are being shaken out, just like they were with bitcoin last week.

Exactly right
@_date: 2013-04-15 15:20:58
1. Stopping QE means they sell government bonds back into the market.
2. That will force yields up.
3. That will lead the government to have much higher borrowing costs.
4. That will increase the deficit problem, as more and more of the tax revenue is eaten up by interest.
5. That will lead to us getting a credit downgrade.
6. Collapse.

On this note, I'd be curious to see the time between gold and whatever served as money before then.  I.e. if the common money prior to gold was seashells, how long did seashells last before gold/silver took over?

Why are you getting down voted?  You are correct.
Also, check what board Krugman sits on (and take note of the members!)

Well perhaps it'll improve the price of bitcoin enough to offset the initial investment cost. I could see bitcoin being worth a fair bit more if there was a fool-proof, secure wallet. My two cents.

Awesome.  
In other music news, wouldn't it be cool if we got Daft Punk to take bitcoins for their new album? 
@_date: 2013-05-22 19:13:50
It's not that "we won't have it."  It's that it probably won't arise as a result of free market forces.  Fractional reserve banking has historically only been a sustainable "strategy" because of the state.  Without deposit "insurance" and central banking, the banking system wouldn't be able to expand credit and pyramid reserves like they do today.  They could certainly try, but one small bank run and they would be totally wiped out.

And is goodwill not valuable?  
The gist of why Bitcoin, or Gold, or Dollars are valuable is because we - the users of these monies - assign value to them.  I get a bit perturbed when people say gold, for instance, has "intrinsic" value.  All value is subjective, and is assigned by participants in that market.  By simply existing in the world does not mean something is valuable.  Gold has value because participants say it does.  Same goes for Bitcoin.
And another point - is it not "goodwill" to say that the Dollar, at least since 1971, is backed by the "full faith and credit of the United States Government?"  That sounds like goodwill to me, in that it is intangible.  The question is, which "goodwill" is worth more?

Haha! Come on man. If you're freakin out this bad, you shouldn't be in bitcoins at all. Clearly the exchanges are facin serious growing pains right now. The fundamentals have not changed - they are actually getting much better. More exchanges will most likely arise from this and soon we'll be right back up to where we were, and higher.

@_date: 2013-04-15 12:53:50
That's right.  If you dollar cost average, you actually WANT the price to "crash" or drop a lot more, if you believe in the fundamentals of bitcoin (i.e., that it will be worth 10k++)
@_date: 2013-06-08 07:43:50
If you are so certain the Fed isn't doing harm to the economy, why are high yield junk bonds trading at record low yields? Or the stock market hitting all-time highs on very little, if any, economic recovery? Or the labor force participation rate at or near all-time lows? Or median new home prices hitting record highs? Or Japan/US/others having more debt by many multiples, yet paying a lower interest rate than before?

@_date: 2013-04-15 13:30:01
I'll echo what most of the top bitcoin community is saying: Bitcoin will have a binary outcome, where it either succeeds and takes over, or it fails and goes to near $0.  We believe it will succeed and take over.  If you look at what it would replace, and look at the size of those foreign exchange markets, the price would be much higher than $10k.
@_date: 2013-04-15 16:09:11
Once the market actually gets wind that the fed will really tighten, they will front run it and sell bonds.  That'll send yields up and gvmt borrowing costs up.  
@_date: 2013-03-11 20:48:29
Great post. If I want more information on what you mentioned at the end, regarding the relationship between miners and transactions, where can I find it? That's one part with bitcoin I'm a bit fuzzy on. Thanks

Why would I spend my bitcoins when I could spend government fiat?  That's the ultimate issue here.  Someone who believes in the fundamental properties of bitcoin ultimately feels that it is more valuable over the long run than government fiat.  Therefore, you would want to save in bitcoin and spend in fiat.  Bitcoin's use will really begin to shine as fiat money finally reaches its ultimate cost of production: $0.

Hah! I hope everyone realizes this is a sleuth attack on bitcoins. They promise you privacy (which we all want), but then say there is or may be a backdoor that will allow police to track money laundering. What in the actual fuck? I oppose this vigorously.

"Hoarding" is a statist term. We "hoarders" just have a high demand for a cash balance of bitcoins. Once goods exist that we have a higher demand for, then we will spend. That's up to the entrepreneurs though - they need to create an awesome product or service that will entice us to spend versus save (hoard).
@_date: 2013-05-22 16:32:37
Interesting piece.  Few points I'd add:
-You state that deflation would be terrible in our current economic situation as it would be harder for debtors to pay back their loans.  Well, that's exactly the point.  Because of the artificial expansion generated by banks with the backing of governments and central banks, more parties have been borrowing money than they otherwise would.  When deflation occurs and the money supply stops expanding, borrowers default!  This is one of the many facets of the Austrian business cycle theory boom and bust.
-Your point about people holding physical bitcoins versus bitcoin substitutes is interesting.  I contend that as bitcoin gains in popularity, there will still be very limited bitcoin substitutes (you call them IOUs).  The closest example now to bitcoin banks is the eWallets, which function as a storage bank in holding your bitcoins and offering various services (exchange, etc).  They, however, don't give you an IOU for the coins.  They keep 100% reserves of the coins and allow you to move them out at any time.
