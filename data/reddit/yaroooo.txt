You've showed me a different point of view on Bitcoins. Makes more sense now. So Bitcoins are a good business alternative to traditional money, just transform money to virtual money.
But what profit (mean as benefits) can have a micro miner with a small investment of 1k/5k$? If there still a benefit for small miners.
Now I think about AltCoins, what are their porpuses?
Bitcoin seems doing their job. AltCoins create more fragmentation like Euro zone was before. Why they was introduced?
I think about too much localization of Bitcoins, something not expected at start. And maybe to.. help small miners? But than I come back to the first question, help them to get profit or access to this money form?

Seems a ratio that affect every device, maybe a little bit less on higher TH rates. Anyhow the profit seems between -10% to +20% of machine price at the end of the first year of mining.
So.. I don't place as question "Are Bitcoins profitable?" becouse answer is evident and depends about your idea of profit.
My question: "Is this the real way to get profit from Bitcoin?"
Seems not a good investment. I put 3k$/5k$/10k$ to recover them after 10 months, than I mine until this machines become obsolete. A gain depends about hash rate. So I assume I can get a profit of 10-30%.. after 15/20months? Than I mine for accumulate Bitcoins with 0 profit.. and I than trash the machines becouse in loose? And I than should buy new ones? Without forgetting the risk.
Is this correct? Pretty low earning ratio.. about 10% each year with a constant work/monitoring of machines and replacement work.
Am I missing something?
Anyway thanks for your answers.

About used products? Are they reliable?
In the website you've linked is said: 800$/year. Is this value real? In 2/3 years will I still able to gain this values with this product?
