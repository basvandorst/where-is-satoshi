Something doesn't add up. If one month you think you have extra cash *you don't need* and a following month *you're so tight on funds that you're considering borrowing* the notion that you didn't need that extra cash is, well, monumentally foolish. Maybe a visit to would be a good option.

You don't realize a gain (or loss) unless you sell or transfer it for something else. If you buy it and sit on it you don't owe tax on it, until you actually do something taxable with it.

Not that bitcoin is currently an improvement but I take it you've never had to transfer money internationally between banks. It is most certainly not instant and not free. The "conventional banking system" does not solely refer to your online shopping.

How is ultra-high risk investing--especially with such dire consequences--not gambling?

I highly doubt that. Do you think easyHotel would go to the cost and trouble to implement a special payment option for just a few random hotels that accepted  bitcoin? That doesn't make sense. Maybe it is limited to certain countries. It seems far more likely that easyHotel has enabled bitcoin payment because they are processing payment, not the hotel directly. This is the same as food delivery services: 1,000 doner shops in Holland don't accept bitcoin, thuisbezorgd.nl accepts bitcoin.

How do you possess bitcoin? It is inherently digital information. Your private key gives you control over some information which is contained within the blockchain. You can't physically hold a bitcoin; it's not a physical thing, but you (alone, hopefully) retain the information which gives you exclusive control of it. It's up to the British government as to how this particular information is regulated, but it is most certainly information. It being money or being used as money is irrelevant; it is still information. 


A bank account pin is a terribly poor analogue of your private key.

It's a currency. The point is to exchange it for goods and services. If you want to use it as a risky investment gamble, by all means do so. But realize that's not its purpose. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 07:33:43
It's interesting to hear how difficult it is to acquire them in other places. In the Netherlands there are exchanges that are trivially easy to use; payment is possible with the debit card-like iDeal payment system and there are no applications or approval processes.

I've bought them twice through one of the Dutch bitcoin exchanges (bitonic). I can pay effortlessly via [iDeal]( and I have the bitcoins minutes later.

Why don't you do some basic research first?

What country are you in? In the unlikely event that it's NL, you can pay by iDeal with bitonic. Trivially easy, no verification (well, an SMS verification over a certain amount but that's instant).

Minor quibble..."to dampen" is to moisten something. Adoption would be damped, not moistened.

You're agreeing with me. In the above post "21k restaurants accepting bitcoin" means that you could go into any one of those restaurants and pay with btc. That's not the case, and I think it is misleading to suggest that it is. Thuisbezorgd or whatever other delivery company is accepting btc, not the individual restaurants. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:43:07


Are they threatened? No. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 07:30:38


That's not accurate. The restaurants are not accepting bitcoin. The home delivery services are. That's an important distinction.

You would need to pay taxes on realized gains, whether through capital gains (which NL doesn't have) or as income. You haven't realized any gains just by buying something, even if it appreciates in value.
