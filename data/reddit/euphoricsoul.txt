I'm seeing a lot more green than red on GDAX. This could be good.

Honestly, it's been sideways for so long, it had to break one way or another eventually.

I think you're being a little optimistic, but I hope you're right.

Watching this is my new obsession. Whenever it hits a milestone price, it goes crazy.

I transferred some BTC that I had in my Coinbase account to my Binance account last night and received the same fee. It sucks, but it's normal.

New investor here. I just got in at $13.2k. Well, in 8 days I will have gotten in when it processes. Been watching it since December. Hopefully it has hit the bottom and is ready to make another run.

Trade volume is way up compared to yesterday at this time. All of the lightweights are panicking. Hodling as usual.

Whoa, thanks for that info. I had no idea.

"The US isn’t the only nation taking a harder line on cryptocurrencies, either: the Chinese government tightened its ban on crypto trading this week, and the South Korean government is planning on implementing a similar ban itself."
Love how they state S. Korea is planning to implement a ban similar to China as if it's fact.

Whenever anyone asks me what Bitcoin is all about I direct them to [this]( Primer on Bitcoin that someone was kind enough to create.

This is the first I've seen of this hearing. Up till now I've only seen the Roubini Haterade tweets. When I saw Van Valkenburg I was immediately relieved. The guy knows and articulates Bitcoin and Blockchain so well. He should continue to be the figurehead for these types of dialogue with U.S. Congress, regulators, and other world leaders.

Do some research on the fundamentals of Bitcoin transactions, increases in hash rate (highest and most diverse ever right now), and attacks on the mempool following the BCH fork and you'll (hopefully) understand why fees won't be an issue this time around.

For what it's worth, this is soon to change as they are supposedly adopting SegWit soon.

I thought Coinbase had an ad going during the Super Bowl; is this not the case?
[This]( is supposedly the one that's going to air. Could be a huge boost to crypto's exposure.
