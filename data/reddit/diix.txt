Holy shit! This is awesome! I imagine people coming by and not even noticing it first hand that those are actually penny’s
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:04:49
Can someone elaborate? a little out of the loop here.
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:05:57
haha that's awesome, uses up a lot of real estate on the small bar though. But looks neat!
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:23:52
Nicehash has been hacked, it's confirmed on their website
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:21:03
thanks! you can tweak the colors of the boxes as much as you'd like and you can upload your own logo.
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:13:16
ask the hundreds of people that i already sent the code to :). As stated before, it's free.
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:03:42
yes, you create a different widget for every coin. You can just copy and paste the API url to the one that you want.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:20:02
Bought in at 8k. I don’t see the big fuss really.. it’s just a dip... buy it and hodl. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:12:06
can i call it Bcash? or will you start screaming?
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:04:37
Same, just ordered my ledger nano s
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:44:35
Thanks for that i believe in opensource and helping people out. Hope you liked it, if you have any questions, hit me up and i'll help out
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:14:20
Answer is in another comment ;) pm me if you want the code!
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:00:01
no i actually use these and they are fully licensed.
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:43:23
haha, you're welcome buddy. You can set the widgets to override the other widgets that apple runs natively on your touchbar. So they are in the foreground all the time
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:28:33
belg ;)
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:45:42
tell me about it... 
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:10:54
Correct, coded it with Apple Script
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:08:40
no but Zelda is great
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:55:47
it would drain your battery in an instant :p
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:04:06
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:08:34
wow, didn't know people would like this actually. It's an app called "BetterTouchTool" do note that it's not a free app, but the developer only asks around 5 euros for a license so it's pretty cheap and worth it. I wrote the code that links through the API of Coinmarketcap. It updates every 0.8 seconds. PM me if you want the code.

pornhub api is a pain in the ass.
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:25:39
dear jesus
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:18:40

@_date: 2017-12-14 00:51:02
sorry to busy looking at prices on my touchbar to come up with a decent reply
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:17:36
thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:50:38
thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:05:01
yeah sort of, having a hard time finding clients or work in general. in between jobs right now.
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:23:12
EDIT 3: hijacking top-comment to post this: 
So far i answered over 300 messages, but have a few more to go. If you have any questions about how to adjust the code to your certain needs, just let me know. I'll try to answer asap. 
Also, i could be selling this as some users pointed out in PM's, but i'm giving it away for free anyway, but consider a donation if you like it it would really help me out. thanks for all the love guys. Never thought this would blow up.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:33:02
too bad they don't support my country.. The only thing i do is buy my crypto (BTC &amp; LTC) through Coinbase, move it to GDAX and then move it to my Ledger Nano S for no fee. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:12:50
yeah, hope so too! Thanks for the kind words.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:14:18
That quote get’s me everytime. Great movie
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:31:54
you can try BTT for free for like 2 months.
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:59:50
thanks! 
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:49:19
EDIT 2: Holy shit just woke up, 120 messages in inbox. Gimme a pee and a cup of black gold and i’m answering everything. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:52:07
App Called bettertouchtool and coding. sent you a pm
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:13:07
was watching netflix while i made this ;) New show called "Manhunt" 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:17:54
cause i'm fancy like that
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:11:29
it's only 4dollars for the developer of BTT, so that's basicly free, and you get the code for free from me. I give people the option to donate on my crypto addresses, but so far nobody bothered. So 4 dollars for a great tool, i would jump on it...
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:39:23
i wish
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:57:56
a Macbook pro 15-inch with touchbar
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:52:52
on that clip you mean? that's Zcash.
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:33:32
this looks great, and way better then my script to be fair! Awesome job man!
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:29:50
Sure man go ahead! give me some credit though! 
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:18:03
a little extra: 
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:48:31
The reason why i didn't post it straight on here is that i didn't know if i could do that (from the mods) and also in the post i use, i give my wallet addresses, i don't want to be considered a beggar straight from the get-go. I figured, if the people are interested, they send me a message. That's about it... Didn't mean to be a hardass about it. If the mods allow it, i'll post the entire thing on here
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:40:54
I don't "make" people donate. The only thing i'm asking is that if they want the code they send me a pm. So far i've replied to everyone and went out of my way to design logo's for them to use on the app. So is that too much to ask? I don't know, ask the hundreds i've sent a reply.
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:44:30
when i get a pm i reply to it with a step by step instruction on how to do it. the code that i give away is actually on my github.. :)
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:41:04
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:29:19
if you would search on github you'll see it's already there since yesterday morning :) 
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:45:59
Thanks! I’ll look into that! community helping out once again!
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:18:38
you can use any api url from coinmarketcap, so yes, it's perfectly possible.
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:02:34
ik kom uit belgisch
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:12:22
EDIT: i'm trying to answers everybody's messages as soon as i can. Didn't think this would "blow up" as it did. Just keep messaging me if you have any questions! Thanks for the replies guys!
