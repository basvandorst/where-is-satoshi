Somebody tipped earlier in the day on this very thread and he stated he'd pay it forward. He did indeed, and then some. This is why bitcoin wins; it saves people real money sending much needed resources home, and it buys a smart guy a coffee.

I'd much rather upvote this than all the Hunt for Satoshi posts

A ruling in one country is a "body blow"? I am not an American, and although I realize what they do carries great influence, I can't see one ruling, which contradicts their own FINCEN actions btw, as a punch to the torso of a global endeavor.

OP I live in the Philippines but lived 25 years of my life in Vancouver. I and many of my friends would love to help your Master Mask Maker and his family convert his BTC to PHP and ensuring his family receive what they need. They cannot as yet transact in BTC here for their day-to-day needs.
I am a member of the local business community, as an owner of the country's largest [Poker Clubs]( [Facebook Page]( and Boracay Island's largest [ISP]( 
Beyond that, I'm part of a growing Bitcoin community locally, with fellow friends in the business community doing what we can to get things going here.
If it's Peso liquidity he seeks, we can certainly help. I'll also be in Vancouver on the 20th till Jan 9. If he wishes to talk, I'd be pleased to do so. Thanks for this post. This is indeed one of Bitcoin's killer apps. Perhaps I'll see you at Waves when I go for my obligatory photo op.
