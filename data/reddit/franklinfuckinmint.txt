This is the tipping point.

There's plenty you can do about it. Basic computer security is **not** difficult.

So only those that had BTC in MtGox share the loss. I thought you meant every person who has BTC anywhere.
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:25:32
How exactly will we all share the loss?

OP, do you understand that this is how mining was always intended to work?
@_date: 2014-10-24 21:20:14
Nope, those things get stolen every single day.

I firmly believe in the long term value of Bitcoin. If the coins that MtGox "lost" are truly gone, then your coins are worth more.

"You got the bitcoins?"
"You got the money?"

How can I trust cash, when I hear of so many stories of it getting stolen?
How can I trust cars, when I hear of so many stories of them getting stolen?
How can I trust iPhones, when I hear of so many stories of them getting stolen?

Have I upset you?
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:04:25
Probably, yes. Nevertheless, this is just another speed bump in many that we've seen and many that we've yet to see.

The idea that somebody would refuse to use a currency because it can be stolen is childish.
@_date: 2014-02-13 11:54:30
Sorry, I'm not a regular here. I hadn't seen any of the previous posts so I thought it might be something new.
@_date: 2014-02-13 11:53:30
Ah, thanks, I didn't realise anybody had posted about this yet.

I think it's important to note that you should move the entire contents of a paper wallet when you decide to spend them, otherwise you could lose the change.
