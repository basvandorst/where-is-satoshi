My website [Level Up Lighters]( is linked with Brave
@_date: 2019-08-13 23:57:57
That is why I made my online website accept Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Etherium. I  also published my website on the Brave system for Basic Attention Tokens. (B.A.T.) If every single website added the option to pay with cryptocurrency Bitcoin would take over, overnight. Check it out and support your online crypto-retailers!

You understand the amount of slander you just spewed against me just because you don’t like how I posted? Don’t you have anything productive to do, I’m trying to build my business and haters like you are trying to tear it down.
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:42:44

Moral of the story, HODL
@_date: 2019-10-05 08:58:54
This is the good news you were looking for
@_date: 2019-06-19 15:09:42
That’s cause most of the population is hustling backwards
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:30:15
That’s what it says . I kinda hope he’s wrong, or maybe those numbers are litter conservative ����‍♂️ I like this moon bound shit
@_date: 2019-06-13 16:01:39
������‍♂️ you right you right
@_date: 2019-06-13 15:52:28
Nothing to do with that
@_date: 2019-10-02 22:35:57
Bitch you posted across all my boards that I’m a scam, what did you think I was gonna do just brush you off?
@_date: 2019-06-29 06:35:33
Yes buy and HODL
@_date: 2019-06-13 16:52:57
I like the way you think &amp; gotta agree with ya it in itself is not the problem solver, but it sure is a nice protective shield for people and their prospective assets. Getting more control back into the consumers hands is key
@_date: 2019-08-12 22:28:28
Awe man you could’ve gotten 25% more bitcoin if you bought yesterday . It’s okay let get you going hop on coinbase and boom you’re good to go

My customers who enjoy their lighters are proof enough. No one needs yours approval.
@_date: 2019-06-18 22:32:07
Yet all the news outlets start their arguments with lies
@_date: 2019-06-13 18:03:10
That is true, but it can greatly drop the amount of bribes being done by ruining the current centralization of services that cause awesome amounts of power to be put in the hands of a few, once that power is spread thin with decentralization the amount of power that bribes have will drop, and in turn the said bribes will drop ����‍♂️
@_date: 2019-10-02 20:50:10
If only they had accepted the wave ��
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:37:01
Oh it’ll demolish 20 better get it while we can
@_date: 2019-06-29 02:08:39
So you can buy it cheaper
@_date: 2019-08-12 22:36:25
I see what you’re saying but 4 days of an international airport being shut down though has to cause something I feel like.
@_date: 2019-06-13 07:04:18
Or maybe only public addresses can be used for certain shit like donations to politicians
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:06:44
As soon as bitcoin is done with its next 130 weeks of growth the alts will rise
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:08:53
That’s just me, but that’s beside the point.
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:35:25
Called it ��
@_date: 2019-06-19 13:19:59
You should, America’s got a lot of muscle strength against those countries
@_date: 2019-06-18 22:34:25
Enlighten yourself this is the tip of the iceberg 
@_date: 2019-06-18 22:05:41
Surprisingly a piece of paper that people still send around
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:21:59
Mine looks like it is working fine
@_date: 2019-06-13 07:27:05
Then a lot of politicians would go hungry ��������‍♂️
@_date: 2019-06-19 16:26:15
@_date: 2019-06-29 00:07:19
I love it, let’s get it, HODL till you can’t no more
@_date: 2019-06-13 07:36:25
That’s exactly why they publicly say they don’t want it but ride it’s dick behind closed doors they want that ultimate control
@_date: 2019-06-13 07:10:07
@_date: 2019-06-13 18:00:10
That is true, but it can greatly drop the amount of bribes being done by ruining the current centralization of services that cause awesome amounts of power to be put in the hands of a few, once that power is spread thin with decentralization the amount of power that bribes have will drop, and in turn the said bribes will drop ����‍♂️
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:46:00

When it goes from 10k to 14k it’s going up, and when it goes from 14k to 10k, it’s going down.

Bruh got 1btc as a whale ��
@_date: 2019-06-19 13:57:10
Using fake real monies to make real internet monies
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:17:00
You missed the point mayne
@_date: 2019-06-13 07:26:30
Law is control
@_date: 2019-06-21 13:48:48
That is true
@_date: 2019-06-10 14:27:54
Or 10 wallets with 100,000,000 BSV each
@_date: 2019-06-18 22:01:00
Should make a free and true media coin backed with blockchain on a chain of events. High brainstorming ����
@_date: 2019-06-19 13:20:54
Glad to help ��
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:40:48
I feel it’ll have some resistance around 17-22k and then boom it’ll fly past maybe to 64k is my guess then back down to around 16-20k.
@_date: 2019-06-13 18:04:17
It won’t prevent it but it will help bring down societal shackles that cause it

Yappp .. try pi it’s badass
@_date: 2019-06-13 16:01:04
Not at all, think outside the box. Crypto can quiet possible destroy the fabrics of the corruption to begin with from different outlets, decentralization ��
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:46:17
People can think what they want, the bits is pure math and numbers don’t lie- just gotta do our part in spreading the word &amp; actually using it.
@_date: 2019-06-13 16:18:12
Stripping power from centralized corporations and oligarchies and dictatorships that currently control our world. I believe in Venezuela the government literally wiped everyone’s bank account clean
@_date: 2019-06-13 07:00:23
If everyone was corrupt, isn’t everyone the same, so then no one is corrupt?
@_date: 2019-06-13 15:48:51
So maybe we should do something about the amount of power they have in the first place
@_date: 2019-06-19 16:37:26
Indirect paths to success, we all have em, bitcoin helped a lot of us
@_date: 2019-06-13 17:55:34

@_date: 2019-06-13 15:46:19
It provokes thought ��
@_date: 2019-06-20 15:28:11
What I’m saying is these 6 companies affect you or all the other countries in the world either way through mass manipulation that should be stopped.
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:03:22
Louder for the alt-HODL’rs in the back please
@_date: 2019-09-25 00:38:10
@_date: 2019-09-24 23:01:19
That’s what I was thinking

Sounds like ��
