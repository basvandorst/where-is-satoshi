For the price that bitcoin, he could hold it for a bit more. But i agreed with what you said, it depends when you are satisfied with the outcome. I would hold it a bit more, but for a person that forgot the coins for a few years and only invested 60$, the 2000$ is a awesome profit and a good boost for his wallet

It is possible to ride a bicycle in lisbon of course, but its true when he says it looks like a mountain... you have a lot of hills making it a bit more difficult that in Amsterdam for example. 
But still awesome place to live, even more now that bitcoin is tax-free

Its was a pretty steep drop in the value, everyone who has money invested in cryptos must be pretty sad for losing that much money... But now its the time to invest, i think, maybe (probably) it will rise again in 2019, you just need to have the balls for it.

People only care about money, why spend time learning.

Its true, nowadays for people to use bitcoin they dont need to understand it, they only need a method of payment easy to use and reliable. But from a investor point of view, if you only want to invest them sell your coins for profit, i think (in my honest opinion) is better to understand it that to simply follow other peoples opinion (not only talking about bitcoin).

You are right and i agree in your way of thinking, we cant understand all things and yet we depend on them on our daily routine. But in this case, in my honest opinion, people should learn a bit more if they want to invest in bitcoin on another crypto. Because they could investing in scams or in poorly designed cryptos and ending up losing alot of money.
