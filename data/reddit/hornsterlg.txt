it does not rly make scence, that balthazar could be the representative of an anonymous corporation. but i think the gifthub page at least gives the police a clue where to start investigating :)
thank you so much for taking care of the trouble with btc-e, btw! :)

that was hard to imagine for me too. why would they risk their image for stealing 2.5 bitcoins.

i have sent them my id, my electricity bill.
id and electricity bill of my brother,
i have a confirmed btc-e account already.
i have send them bank swift documents .
i have send them bank swift documents that my brother gave me 1000€ and i gave 1000€ to btc-e 1 day after.
there is absolutely nothing unclear. they can not answer with questions anymore, so they ignore me on purpose now. because they simply just want to keep the bitcoins.

update 16.03.2017: solved. after i made this public and posted it on more then 20 websites who were on top of google. after "balthazar" received a -trustpoint at bitcointalk.org and went super angry. after threatening to sue them - they finally gave up. i got my bitcoins now :) thank you very much for your help. i hope bitcoin exchanges will have more respect of their customers in the future.
