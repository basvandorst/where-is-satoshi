How can e.g. someone selling bitcoins via localbitcoin be "hacked" in such a way that I lose my money (either USD or BTC)? Or an online merchant lose my BTC, which they don't have access to? That's the difference between a "pull" system (credit cards, bank account transfers) and push (bitcoin). 
For the *very* restricted use-case of a coinbase-style company which has to interface with my bank, yes, they have a higher bar to clear security-wise. But that's definitely not the position UPS is in... they're just a merchant.

It is getting to be a rather tired old argument, but IMHO any system that resolves urls via cgi dispatch, causing it to expose internal code and runtime state together in a publically traversable url tree, is asking for trouble.  You have to do extra work *not* to foul it up.
Though what I was actually referring to was things like the MD5-Crypt issue back in 2011, where for a short number of releases, the crypt() function's md5 crypt algorithm was generating output that would let any password validate. 
My problem isn't necessarily with that, everything has bugs, but with the fact that they already had unittests for that exact case... and *even with critical security unittests failing, they couldn't be arsed to hold off making a public release*. That's the "cavalier" attitude I was referring to.

But "quirk" does imply a known behavior that can be comfortably worked around... Like a car door which doesn't lock unless you hit it just right, so you always make sure to hit it just right, and the problem is solved enough. 
Which I think conveys the status of the malleability issue pretty well.

I'd argue AOL and the like did much more for making the internet available to the average Joe -- providing dialup, a "web browser", email hosting, etc. 
Microsoft in particular was apathetic about the internet for a long while, so much so a third party company was making a product called Winsock to provide a PPP/TCP stack for windows. It wasn't until after all of that started to become a huge success that Microsoft *bought* the winsock company, since their API had now become the defacto standard. Even after they got serious, and started in on their IE project, AOL and the dialup providers still had a much huger foot print for a long while.

Given that Facebook is written in PHP, with it's cavalier attitude towards security, I'd say the tables were set against them from the beginning... and if I were the security guy for facebook, I would have given it up for a lark and moved on (after getting facebook-rich first, of course)

That's the key thing which I think makes bitcoin be "like cash, but better".  I've got some sitting on my phone in a mycelium wallet.

I explicitly stated that bitcoin doesn't get rid of this problem for businesses with a need to have ongoing access to user funds; but that it would solve the problem merchants such as UPS, *who have no need to ever hold user funds*.  A sarcastic blanket statement against a strawman assertion I never made doesn't contribute much to the conversation.

Because they're not actually bitcoins until you transfer them out, they're just a promise that the exchange will give you bitcoins. The price on an exchange is a function of market demand for bitcoin crossed with the markets expectation at bring able to redeem that promise.

I dunno... it says to me that bitcoin doesn't have the mass market penetration to make the big names want to hop on, but that it's got enough of a market that the runners-up see it as worth their time (as they're hungry for any slice they can grab which has a reasonable return on the investment). 
Which honestly is about where I think bitcoin should be right now... there are still some technical and institutions bumps that need to be ironed out and workflows polished before it's 100% ready for Jane / Joe Not-That-Tech-Saavy Consumer. 
I think it's similar to Linux on the desktop circa 2004 -- it worked mostly, but sometimes required editing a config file -- whereas now I can install Linux Mint on a laptop and give it to my parents without worrying I'll be talking them through editing /etc/X11/xorg.conf :)

IMO, this is the key feature of Bitcoin.  The service being provided (ChangeTip) isn't bound to the currency (Bitcoin) or to the user's bank (their wallet, Coinbase, etc).  ChangeTip, Coinbase, etc can all be dropped, without disrupting the overall ability to exchange money, or for anyone outside those affected by the particular interface having to change things.
As opposed to if Disqus had PayPal integration... users are forced to use single company for tipping, currency, and wallet; or not use the the feature at all.

They are still taking it as payment, at least as of a month ago. The one catch was that everything in your order has to be from Newegg, not a third party seller, or the btc option doesn't show up. Took me a bit too figure that out, they really should explain that better.

Sadly it's inevitable -- If two things have value to humans, there will be exchanges of those two things. The ratio of those exchanges will vary based on desperation, location, and time. Someone will exploit those variations for profit. It doesn't even require currency... 6000 years ago, some guy probably spent most of his time trading in cows for the new "domesticated" chicken, until everyone in his village gave him WAY more back just to get some chickeny-goodness.

Monopoly money can be counterfeited by pretty much anyone with a photocopier. USD and BTC require a nation-state or better. 
(Really, BTC would require cracking SHA256 and/or ECDSA, which I doubt even a nation-state will achieve any time soon).

I don't quite get what Authy is trying to do. 
GAuth (aka TOTP, aka [RFC 6238]( is very simple, involving a shared secret stored on the server and on your phone. Server-side, the secret can be encrypted using your password, so a direct database dump doesn't reveal it. The phone / other client doesn't even have to have a net connection, it's just a time-based token generator, making it *much* more resilent to online attacks (if you so desire).
Unless I'm missing something, Authy seems to overly complicate that whole process. Now there's a third party (Authy) who actually stores the secrets and does the authentication, meaning authy is a single point of failure for all services that use it. And they charge for it. And now there has to be a secure side channel between authy and the service you're trying to use, which can also be attacked. Finally, it looks like authy requires your phone have a net connection, meaning there's more in their protocol than just TOTP, and negating the offline security that GAuth is capable of. Furthermore, it's not even an open standard -- you *have* to use authy's app.
What's the advantage of it over GAuth?
@_date: 2013-09-04 18:53:52


That's probably why I came down a little harshly on Authy in my comments. Nothing against the company itself, but I'm a decade younger than you, and I'm already sick of SPOF :)

Their fees are 0.55% per usd&lt;-&gt;btc trade, though you can get a 10% lifetime discount by signing up via a referral link, such as [this one]( (which uses my account ;)
I've only used CampBX a few weeks or so, but aside from the Dwolla setup, everything was pretty simple. CampBX's interface is impressively clean, and I think the reason people are calling them solid is that they deliberately undergo periodic independant security audits, and are one of the few exchanges that don't seem to have been hacked *at all*. 
They also recently added Google Authenticator support to lock your account, which is awesome.
The volume is pretty low, but they seem to track within a few $/btc of the MtGox price, so I'm not *too* unhappy about that aspect.

To my knowledge, Litecoin has only one serious difference with bitcoin: the proof-of-work function is based on scrypt rather than sha256. 
The main thing to know about scrypt is that it was designed to require an (arbitrary) lot of memory, meaning the hashrate/$ should be close to the same whether you're using a CPU, GPU, or ASIC. This is because the advantages of task-specific parallelism that ASICs provide are greatly decreased when you have to drop a lot of high-performance RAM onto every chip as well... it starts to resemble a CPU in architecture, and in cost.
Litecoin's idea was that this would prevent the network being dominated by a few high-efficiency ASICs; because if everyone and their brother with a GPU could mine competitively, the network would be more democratized. 
The two untested assumptions are: 1) that competively-efficient scrypt ASICs won't be developed, and 2) that bitcoin's ASICs will actually lead to a consolidation in the mining pool.
I wouldn't say this was an oversight in bitcoin's design... scrypt wasn't as well known back when it was first designed. Nor would I be suprised if scrypt got picked if/when bitcoin ever switches to a different hash function.

D'oh - rereading my comment, even my sarcasm detector is having trouble. Didn't mean for it to come out that way. I was actually referring in seriousness to his role re: the internet. 
Though now that you mention it, while Current TV was a huge failure, I still respect his stated reason for backing it: that TV is a dangerously and asymmetrically one-way medium, which does a great deal of damage to the free exchange of ideas our democratic system relies on. Of course, Current TV wasn't even *remotely* a good solution - but luckily YouTube came along :)

Not entirely sure, but I think the point is that a ripple iou contains both an &lt;amount&gt; and a &lt;currency unit&gt; field. There's no innate unit to act as a store of value (ala a currency), the value is dependant on whatever &lt;currency unit&gt; a given ripple xfer is using. 
Whereas a virtual BTC wallet or a physical USD wallet contains only an &lt;amount&gt; field, so it's value is pegged to the value of a bitcoin... hence allowing speculation as to that value, and functioning as currency. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 16:21:02
Another potential solution is [colored coins]( which seem (from what I can tell) to function similarly to ripple, but using the bitcoin metadata fields to store the information, ala namecoin. 
Which does look like it would have the effect of splitting the function of an exchange into two parts: 1) third parties that are "backing" a given colored coin, promising to exchange them for X value of Y currency, and then 2) using the whole blockchain as an exchange market. Not sure how it'll work in practice thouugh.

Indeed. Especially since 109.50 isn't *too* far outside the weekly range of recent fluctuations, one could expect it to hit that again sometime soon. I would have placed a buy order at 109.50, and let it ride. Maybe cancel it after some upper point where the losses are too much (120 or so), and buy in again. Then again, maybe 115 *was* OP's re-buy threshold. $4k isn't a loss to be sneezed at :(

He's not saying it will account for any specific product's market behavior (e.g. matches bitcoin's growth pattern). He's saying it's the best representation of something which has value. Thus, it will more properly display the rate of change, rate of acceleration, etc, whatever that happens to be.

D'oh - I meant "removable-seed" instead of "seedless". Still getting the hang of the bitcoin-crypto terminology :)
I agree - the storage requirements, generation time, and seed size are big issues for an RSA wallet. On top of that, merchant sites wanting to use thowaway keys per-transaction would have to periodically generate and load new public keys onto their servers (as opposed to a one-time setup), thus increasing administrative costs. 
All together, I think all those issues would make deterministic wallets impractical ( assuming they were even theoretically workable to begin with). And without throwaway keys for each transaction, that would serious impact anonymity on the blockchain, which would be a much bigger problem for bitcoin's prospects. So maybe the "ecc the foundation of bitcoin" thing isn't unreasonable after all.
Thinking about an RSA seeded wallet a bit more, I'm not sure if a larger seed would even be enough. The only part of the RSA key generation process that's controllable is the entropy fed into the PRNG &amp; primality testing code. But which prime it arrives at is extremely sensitive to how the underlying implementation consumes the randomness. So your key generation code couldn't take advantage of any advances in PRNGs or primality testing, use any architecture-specific optimizations, or almost other any minor tweaks; because that would change the order it consumes randomness in, making it generate an entirely different series of keys, and thus wouldn't be backwards- or cross-architecture- compatible. Making the entire seed concept massively fragile.

A "dark" order is one that don't show up publically on the order table  / depth chart, and the market only finds out about it when they hit it. On campbx, all it takes is setting a flag saying "make the a dark order". 
I don't entirely see the point, but supposedly it helps people move large amounts without distorting the market, because other everyone would see e.g. 1000BTC is about to be sold, and affect the pricing.
@_date: 2013-05-18 15:54:41
Safe? Maybe. I haven't looked at the code. 
Wise? No. The whole point of GAuth is that the secret key is in only two places, the server and your token generator (usually an app on your phone), and never in the same place as your password. The core idea is that if someone is watching your computer (via keylogger, whatever), all they get is your password and the current token -- which will be useless in 30 seconds. Whereas if the entire secret key is on your computer, once they get your password as well, they can impersonate you from then on. 
Ideally, you wouldn't even use an internet-connected smartphone for GAuth, but an old smartphone whose wifi &amp; cell chips had been physically burned out, so it did nothing but qrcode-reading and token generation.

There's also the under-development [zerocoin]( system, which would modify the bitcoin protocol slightly to provide decentralized mixing service which uses the blockchain for storage.
@_date: 2013-09-04 16:33:01
Last I looked into it, Yubikey's algorithm wasn't open source, and authenticating a Yubikey required passing the token to their servers (which were the only location that contained the secret key(outside of your Yubikey itself), and getting an answer back. That's proprietary single point-of-failure in my book.
That said, as benad pointed out in a another response, Yubikey has opened up their protocol, and offers a server-side library ( which doesn't require a third-party. So while that might not be how most Yubikeys are deployed, it's certainly enough for me to retract my statement about them.

I was mainly trying to prevent confusion between using Authy's app's TOTP support, and using Authy's core protocol; since they have such different security considerations, and many people are unaware that Google Auth *doesn't* in fact involve Google's servers. 


I never implied otherwise. To quote the third paragraph of my comment: 


Regarding Yubikey, no I wasn't aware of that offline library for them. That's great, and puts their system above Authy's in my book. I haven't used Yubikey for a few years, but I may go revisit them now!
@_date: 2013-04-01 05:55:44
The primary difference between traditional escrow and N-of-M (or 2-of-3 in this case) is that the third party does not hold the money, so they can't abscond with it either. They can either approve of the txn or not, no further trust is extended to them.
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:17:34
Yeah, their charts are quite underwhelming. [Bitcoinity]( recently added a CampBX feed, so there must be a datasource somewhere. I just wish there was a live-updating graph on the site itself, instead of the lackluster [depth table]( 
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:52:32
Why would they still have BTC by the time they shipped it? I'd imagine they'd take the USD price, add a 5% commission for the heck of it, list in it BTC at the week-high market rate, and convert the BTC to cold hard USD bits as soon as they received it.
@_date: 2013-09-04 14:46:21
Authy isn't a drop-in replacement for GoogleAuth, it's a proprietary centralized single-point-of-failure system, much like Yubikey.
Google Authenticator is just an implementation of the TOTP protocol. The great part about TOTP is that it doesn't require an internet connection, or a third party. Google isn't actually involved in any way. Your phone (or other device) contains a secret key and a semi-accurate clock, and the service you're authenticating with does the same. For security, you can even use an old smart phone with all it's transmitters disabled, and TOTP will still work. There's no third party to converse with, or act as single point of failure.
On the other hand, while Authy's app supports Google Auth token generation, their core (closed) protocol requires your phone connect to them, and the service you're authenticating with connect to them, and their server acts as a single point of failure for everything. It's much more complicated and centralized than Google Auth / TOTP, and you are trusting their servers with *everything*. Not to mention it costs the service you're authenticating with; whereas TOTP is free and decentralized, and anyone can write a server or client for it.

However, I *would* say ECC is the foundation of ~~seedless~~ removable-seed deterministic wallets (e.g. Electrum).
I can't think of another asymmetric crypto system that lets you derive new public keys from existing ones without having to have knowledge of the private keys, and to also be able to derive the corresponding private keys in parallel and in isolation. 
You *might* be able to do that with RSA, but I don't immediately see how, and haven't ever heard of it being done. 
*edit: meant "removable seed" instead of "seedless", as cdelargy pointed out.*
