Sats, that's what you need.
@_date: 2019-11-14 22:03:57
It's more like an exchange/kiosk.
The operator should have the right to charge whatever they want, they set up the ramp.
@_date: 2019-11-18 09:54:34
Let us know of your experience.
@_date: 2019-11-22 20:37:30
This is great news for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-18 20:33:48
I believe it has something to do with the US postal system having recently made a big contract with Nvidia.
@_date: 2019-11-30 15:03:48
Zero day BTC holder, you may have been of the few that have witnessed the elusive satoshi in real life. 
0dayBTC hodlr
@_date: 2019-11-25 00:14:31
Thought with permissions and its repo on Fdroid this was possible?
@_date: 2019-11-24 01:35:41
Every little sat adds up, so yeah. 
Beggars can't be choosers.
@_date: 2019-11-07 21:38:17
Yes. It will let you know after you request if it has enough, sometimes the first or 2nd splash page, something like the "sell" button is dark or grey, means there's no cash at that particular location. 
If you're cashing out 10k at any btm, call the operator and do an otr tx in person. No ID needed since it's p2p OTR tx.
They all oblige. Specially operator's of RocketCoin.
@_date: 2019-11-04 20:19:13
They're everywhere now.
@_date: 2019-11-27 12:32:11
Means that particular machine is out of cash to dispense, you can only buy or sell for another one of them shit coins.
@_date: 2019-11-16 06:59:22
You might loose them with wasabi wallet. 
Use electrum. 
Save your 12 word seed.
@_date: 2019-11-30 15:00:32
Just admit you're an imbecile, you may find what you seek.
@_date: 2019-11-09 19:31:08
Works everytime.
@_date: 2019-11-06 03:38:40
Is this McAfee doing?
@_date: 2019-11-30 15:08:15
Never used them, still doing OTR trades successfully I don't know what everyone else problem is honestly.
@_date: 2019-11-27 12:23:33
Bought 10 bitcoin instead of paying rent about 8 years ago. 
Now I own a house and started my own business after selling 4 of them about two years ago when they hit $15k, shorted myself on coin, long gain on the proper investment.
@_date: 2019-11-22 20:36:02
They have a news section.
The content is very good, and they are doing another ICO looks like. 
Stick to electrum.
@_date: 2019-11-16 07:03:19
They're legit.
@_date: 2019-11-22 23:38:38
Hodl for ten years. Check back then and you won't regret it. Ask anyone involved 10 years ago that did that.
@_date: 2019-11-04 21:27:17
Bitcoin volatility causes this.
@_date: 2019-11-24 21:49:04
Bitify.com? Still infested with scammers, most likely internal scammers.
@_date: 2019-11-21 19:50:29
Never been a better time this fall into winter.
@_date: 2019-11-25 00:15:53
So you can get shitcoins digitally and physically, Pepsi giving most boomers the runs lol.
@_date: 2019-11-07 20:51:50
They'll have you contact their legal department to settle things after they lock your account. Takes months to hear back from them as their legal department only handles fax or snail mail for these sort of issues. Happened to me. I bought cards off of bitrefill and they claimed because they looked suspicious they locked my account, receipts and all.
@_date: 2019-11-06 11:08:03
Makes for business that require 3 or more confirmations before proceeding suck.
@_date: 2019-08-22 18:51:30
Yes. That usually does the trick. I can't stand sites that have min. withdrawal systems, they usually trap you with some retarded number like the one you're experiencing. 
Maybe make enough noise to see if they have intentions to scam.
@_date: 2019-08-22 19:05:26
The whole "you don't have private keys, not your coin", with T.O.S. like min. 5btc withdraw, they can run off and claim they were hacked. This happens in dark net markets all the time.
@_date: 2019-10-07 03:55:14
That's what she said.
@_date: 2019-10-03 22:38:41
Guess I'll wait till the consensus comes to an agreement, which wallet is trustworthy.
@_date: 2019-10-11 00:23:37
My account was closed.
@_date: 2019-10-13 22:01:40
They're great, you can finally purchase petro with coin, you also can by using your walmart giftcards at Sam's petro station.
@_date: 2019-10-06 13:23:05
If you're not running core, electrum desktop is best, don't bother with their app, there's Mycellium for that, in which, not recommended, you can restore a Mycellium account on electrum.
@_date: 2019-10-07 01:42:22
Mycellium is the best on android.
@_date: 2019-10-03 22:10:27
So is it usable or broken?
@_date: 2019-10-19 06:13:24
No KYC/AML far as I know. TerribleHerbts is a chain gas station in Las Vegas.
@_date: 2019-10-07 01:35:22
When I buy you sell, when I sell you buy, follow that rule and you will be rich lol. 
That's my luck.
@_date: 2019-10-03 23:34:27
Like the monero wallet, where you don't necessarily need to download the blockchain to use it.
@_date: 2019-10-03 23:23:56
Is it possible to run bitcoin core without downloading the block chain.
@_date: 2019-10-11 16:49:24
Glad it was, that's a low quality USB hardware to be placing your coins in. 
Wondering which is the highest quality USB to run a ledger from.
@_date: 2019-10-07 20:33:50
Use Mycellium, it's the most intuitive on Android.
@_date: 2019-10-07 03:54:49
Is that why we have BVC, bc, bch etc?
@_date: 2019-12-28 16:46:30
There are a lot of atms, check Coinatm.app

Finally, I don't have to drive to Berkeley and use their shitty BTMs to pay my dealer lol
@_date: 2019-12-12 04:48:13
iOS sucks lol, all crypto wallets on IOS suck.
@_date: 2019-12-22 17:35:47
It's like Venmo, or PayPal option to give a short link with you tag on it far asi understand. Great for adoption.

Motorola makes a phone that has a portable projector for about $400
@_date: 2019-12-24 18:26:43
You tube is not the only service like it, matter of fact their are plenty better options.
This is great for crypto like bitcoin, means it's working, the powers that be are scared. 
And history shows, you can't beat bitcoin.

Sloan machines in Michigan average 50%, fucking highway robbery. And are KYC/AML bitches. Boycott Sloan machines in Michigan.

Still a Lambo.
@_date: 2019-12-10 01:34:25
Many companies are rejecting their very own gift cards. 
Amazon got me for $80 cause they wouldn't accept gift cards purchased from bitrefill, true story, still waiting on their "legal" team to contact me.
Never will use Amazon or any of their services again.
@_date: 2019-12-12 04:45:43
Nobody is, not bitrefill, not fold, not egifter, not gyft.
Not even CVS stores.
@_date: 2019-12-18 16:44:46
I thought she was a sex worker. 
I've had hookers give me bitcoin gifts and cater to my obsession for bitcoin by pasting pasties with bitcoin on them knockers.
@_date: 2019-12-14 00:37:58
Their are plenty alternatives. Search around, you will be surprised. 
I haven't needed to use them since and life is good.
@_date: 2019-12-14 23:13:26
So how is Purse.io doing these days?
@_date: 2019-12-28 11:35:54
The one at heart attack grill.
@_date: 2019-12-12 04:44:50
Amazon has been doing this since July.
One guy lost $4k in gift cards.  I personally lost $80. According to Amazon, any gift card bought outside their service is subject to confiscation. This includes the ones bought at CVS, as it's happened to me with a $20 test buy. Then their legal department has only a fax and an email, with only a post office PO BOX as an office location. They never answer. I've been emailing them since September at the least once a week.
Fuck Amazon.
@_date: 2019-12-30 07:50:05
Looked into our myself, way to intrusive.
@_date: 2019-09-16 20:19:58
Didn't ask actually. I'm sure they can get tipped in crypto. The girls at DeJaVu on Sammy Davis Jr DR. take crypto. I see them cashing out every now and then.
@_date: 2019-09-23 13:47:14
Not it the blockchain Gods learn of bitcoins plans. Least not forget, the Gods laugh at plans.
@_date: 2019-09-28 13:05:37
They'll respond promptly unlike Amazon. 
And they are very helpful. 
Amazon won't even go get you a supervisor,.

So is this competition for Samurai or Wasabi?

I recall Brave giving them out as earnings for using their browser. Maybe I smoked the indica this morning.
@_date: 2019-09-23 20:34:45
Starting to sound like a pump and dump scheme.
@_date: 2019-09-17 02:42:31
I wonder if they use BitPay lol
@_date: 2019-09-11 15:07:17
Try eGifter.
Google play took them off play store, but you can still download the apk and it works fine.
@_date: 2019-09-23 20:49:28
Send a very small amount to the very same address they left from.
@_date: 2019-09-29 01:18:26
I bought them at bitrefill. They specifically said it was because I got the gift cards outside of Amazon services.
I'm done fit today/ tonight highlighting this issue. 
I'll be back everyday till it's resolved. 
I never let up, specially after being robbed for $80, which is clearly what they have done.
@_date: 2019-09-17 04:55:30
Paid the maximum fee approved by Mycellium wallet and bumped it.
@_date: 2019-09-23 14:11:03
@_date: 2019-09-22 19:27:49
Earn it, their are plenty legal ways.
@_date: 2019-09-08 11:08:49
Yeah, and then someone formats it to save a bootleg copy of Lucifer, whipping it clean.
@_date: 2019-09-18 12:48:42
Just because their are gift cards to certain stores doesn't mean they directly accept BTC.
@_date: 2019-09-23 21:04:05
Yup and nope, the address you sent the coins from preferably. Should also possibly wok l work sending it to the address you sent it to also.
@_date: 2019-09-16 19:49:17

Tell those DouchBags at COINBASE to Bite You!
@_date: 2019-09-19 03:47:25
In the end, you won't have to Neo, trade BTC for fiat.
@_date: 2019-09-16 20:50:12
It's been there for three years now.
@_date: 2019-09-28 12:14:24








@_date: 2019-09-25 22:18:13
Well Amazon support sucks then. They just got me for $80.
@_date: 2019-09-16 20:49:46
I believe the other coins are there because some offer little to no transaction fees.
@_date: 2019-09-23 13:59:44
None of your remember Potcoin?
@_date: 2019-09-27 02:31:23
Been waiting got that too happen. 
Tip: use a federal bank, less stipulations.
@_date: 2019-09-19 03:47:38
In the end, you won't have to Neo, trade BTC for fiat.
@_date: 2019-09-17 05:15:47
You really don't know how to read neem the lines huh?
@_date: 2019-09-07 20:35:30
My buddy through in when it faintly landed at $7k. We went on vacation, came back and it was climbing $10k.
@_date: 2019-09-11 21:36:15
eGifter uses your services, never had a problem sending dirty coins there. 
Why did Gyft drop BTC?
@_date: 2019-09-16 02:45:07
Lol, I put stickers everywhere, collected .85643 btc so far. Traded it for XMR.
@_date: 2019-09-28 13:28:07
Use RocketCoin or Hilt if you choose not to comply with KYC/AML.
@_date: 2019-09-17 05:27:12
Passing through. Been exploring every city that is crypto friendly for the past three weeks. Baltimore, Philadelphia, Detroit, Denver, Chicago, Los Angeles's, Las Vegas, are the best.
@_date: 2019-09-17 06:16:03
Never to late in the bitcoin game.
@_date: 2019-09-23 13:40:54
Pay close attention genius, most the BTMs in Vegas are CoinCloud. They also have the best rates, and most of the time they actually have fiat fit trade versus the latter.
@_date: 2019-09-10 15:40:45
Actually, I've witnessed many successful stories with btc, starting from debt, ending up with a Tesla, three dispensaries and double the coin investment hodlng.
Anything is possible.
@_date: 2019-09-16 18:45:05
I tried, they didn't even know. American Conney Island told me they no longer take bitcoin, their excuse, they didn't know how to use their payment system.
@_date: 2019-09-11 19:49:17
I wonder if they used Monero to pay for that shipment of drugs?
@_date: 2019-09-27 21:18:45
I did, the people behind bitrefill are prompt and awesome.
What service do you have? I noticed your user name?
@_date: 2019-09-11 11:28:12
He needs a sign. Stupid people without a sign should be tagged and released.
@_date: 2019-09-17 02:40:13
Was it a SLOAN machine? Those guys are a RIP off and barely mapped on the coin radar app because of their more than intrusive services. Don't sell them dirty, tumbled coins, they'll keep it and ask for KYC/AML.
@_date: 2019-09-22 12:31:52

This is for foolish IOS users. You can pretty much control everything that happens on android. Still, with privacy comes great responsibility.
@_date: 2019-09-26 18:57:00
The other problem is their are barely avenues for proper discussion.
@_date: 2019-09-08 12:01:47
Could be a TAILS OS USB, finder sees nothing cause they didn't reboot the computer with the USB attached, decided to upcycle and reformat the usb for storing episodes of Will and Grace. Would the os still be redeemable with Parrot OS software tools? Or is the box debanned to factory settings?
@_date: 2019-09-07 20:33:08
Coingecko should create an app, bet they would kill it, I usually just have them as one of my home pages.
@_date: 2019-09-22 11:08:36
Bitcoin -1
@_date: 2019-09-10 15:42:08
I lost $40k when they were worth $4k+/- cause I didn't keep my keys. 
House blew up from a leaky pipeline.
@_date: 2019-09-28 20:20:30
So you're implying bitrefill have fraudulent gift cards?
@_date: 2019-09-24 23:11:40
Not your keys, not your bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-23 20:09:33
Didn't it have something to do with Brave browser?
@_date: 2019-09-17 05:23:35
Mickey Finns, the Hennessy bar?
@_date: 2019-09-17 01:42:55
Bitrefill makes it possible to pay most phone and cable bills.
@_date: 2019-09-27 21:19:14
Buy the way egifter works on android if you download the apk directly from them.
@_date: 2019-09-07 20:25:18
Is the fee cheaper than archaic methods?
@_date: 2019-09-17 05:01:04
Yeah, but when you're trying to pay for a drink, you're not trying to wait 45 min for a confirmation. By then the beer is stale.
@_date: 2019-09-27 22:53:40
Nothing like healthy competition. 
I'll try you guys out here soon.

Rocket Coin lol

You can just buy Amazon gift cards with bitcoin, then use Amazon directly without the pesky 3rd party service Purse.io offers.
@_date: 2019-09-17 05:19:10
Go to The D casino in Vegas and try it yourself. I think what really happened was my network was lagging. Everything is running smooth now.
@_date: 2019-09-28 10:57:41
@_date: 2019-09-22 19:26:32
After everything was said and done, the machine titled, didn't dispense cash. Now I'm stuck over 24hrs no support response.
@_date: 2019-09-23 21:21:37
Might as well wait now. 
Next time use electrum or a wallet that allows you to RBF, or child pays for parent. 
Also, remember, not your keys, not your bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-07 20:28:27
Uber opened up shop in troubled parts of Africa, I wonder if some adoption like purchasing gift cards will boost the btc ecosystem. Better yet, they even have the ability to use candy bar phones, texting btc tx.
Mesh net and NFC. BTC is the future.
@_date: 2019-09-19 17:41:58
Amazon giving me problems over them. Didn't want to end up on the headlines guilty by ignorance should their cards cause me legal problems. Here bitcoin wins again had I used Purse.io, where you're almost shipping directly with coin, considering you have to send coin to their addresses and hope some prime member picks up the order.
@_date: 2019-09-22 20:31:05
Lol, it's Sunday, I take it not even their Philapeno call center is off on God's day.

The nurses at the door are highly aware and possibly vested themselves. They see many throughout the day just visiting the machine and then leaving. Curiosity and satisfaction you know.
@_date: 2019-09-23 21:17:59
What wallet are you using?
@_date: 2019-09-17 06:10:23
The more the merrier, I was looking into it myself, the cheapest machine is $6k.
Worth it if you have the coins. I spoke to a young man who had 7 of them through out the city and he said they pay themselves off within a month, the rest profit.
@_date: 2019-09-17 01:33:04
I found a Rocket Coin machine in the deepest hood in Detroit. Detroit has tons of bitcoin machines. Mysterious right?
