I see nothing wrong with this implementation. Big companies always want your information. You're free to not use this feature, I believe.

Greetings dear brethren. :)

The great thing about Bitcoin is that your opinion actually counts. I'm sure down the road most of the concerns stated here will be somehow incorporated into a new software update. Power to the people!

This makes me wish that my grandfather was still alive. He would have loved Bitcoin.

Hi folks,
Last Thursday, the Simon Fraser Bitcoin Club from beautiful Vancouver Canada (home to the world's first BTC ATM) held an event called "The Power of Bitcoin". Close to 100 people attended.
At the end of that event, $1,500 CAD in BTC was donated to Schools Building Schools at what was the world's first live/in-person Bitcoin fundraiser. 
Schools Building Schools, a federally registered charity in Canada, recently became the first CDN organization of its kind to accept bitcoins for donations after consulting with the club. 
$1,500 is not too shabby for a first try!
(A final donation of $500 will be made soon by the Vancouver Bitcoin Co-op).
So there you have it! Welcome to the power of Bitcoin!
Mike Yeung, Founder &amp; President of the Simon Fraser Bitcoin Club

Well the writer is from Penthouse and will have another piece on Bitcoin in the Jan issue of Penthouse. So the title is just a jab at that.
But yes, the unconventional writing style is a good way to soften the serious tone of the Bitcoin community.
