Ok.. So? Its not like he made it and he has any power over it, i could just as well make a reddit coin and tell reddits founders to go away

Id say 10k,if it doesn't explode, 100k if it explodes like the tsar nuke, but its still gonna go up so invest anyway, not more than you can afford though

Tencent, one of the biggest gaming companies, app companies and if im not wrong one of the biggest Chinese companies, they're everywhere and they're dangerously quiet. For anyone that didn't know
@_date: 2019-11-08 21:36:10
Well, they got soo much info at this point they can be compared to Google and Facebook, also they got so many companies under their grip they can just influence them and the global gaming market easily (a lot of the most popular games right now are under their influence, league of legends being the biggest, and pubg mobile on phones) all while being controlled by the Chinese government.. Because the government has total power more or less over everything in their country, i haven't actually seen tencent doing anything bad for now besides greediness, and not even their greed is that bad, but its still dangerous that they're so big, and almost no one really knows about them

Nothing, i just wait

No? Lol you invest for your future, you won't gain anything by investing and then bailing next month, if it goes down its only got one other way to go, up, even if up may be in 10 years, it will still happen
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:55:58
I bought at 4k lol
@_date: 2019-06-28 15:38:13
Sadly i dont have the money to buy considerably cuz i would :(
@_date: 2019-06-28 21:18:56
It'll probably keep fluctuating, because people will still buy and sell it

Fiat is regulated daily by banks, that's why they're stable, they wouldn't be stable like this just because of us, because we can easily try to disrupt it
@_date: 2019-06-07 19:00:19
Well yes? Even if it crashes its nowhere nearly as bad as crypto, get your head out of your ass, just because you own a bitcoin it does not mean you are jesus, facts are facts, your opinion doesn't matter, fiat doesn't crash nearly as much nor as bad as crypto and it never will

Maybe very expensive but not a lambo
@_date: 2019-06-12 08:55:45
I understood about 0% of that sentence
@_date: 2019-06-12 20:40:44
I see, too bad you need to learn the words and how to use them, not just read
@_date: 2019-06-07 17:20:28
Never, it won't be, its just a way to make money or use money but it won't be the future
@_date: 2019-06-12 20:15:35
Learn some books and then maybe ill understand what you're saying
@_date: 2019-06-12 19:33:06
Every single one
@_date: 2019-06-07 17:47:23
Because people want something stable and controlled for every day use, while bitcoin may have crashes every others week, fiat will maybe have one ever hundred years, i dont want one day to be a millionaire and next day not being to be able to buy bread,bitcoin will most likely go along with fiat, but never replace it, if i go to do anything shady then bitcoin is perfect but for anything else id use fiat, also i dont want bitcoin to be stable, i make nice money :p

At the ocean level

But, you always pay for the bank to hold the money?
