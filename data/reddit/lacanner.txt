I never mentioned BIP38 once, that's other people.   I'm referring to Electrum's lack of standards (BIP32, etc) when it comes to deterministic wallets.  If those change, your 12 words are meaningless.  Also, how much legacy hardware and software will you have to maintain just to retrieve a few private keys?  As for BIP38, there is a school of thought that says it isn't good for paper wallets because of the key management aspect.  YMMV.
I treat my paper wallets like I would a stack of cash.  Physical security is paramount and has well-established best practices that have been in use for centuries.  I'm "pushing" for simplicity and not trying to reinvent the wheel.
Also, you seem to be treating your wealth as an individual concern where some of us in this thread worry about our estates and families.  I think those considerations alone would preclude the use of any memory-based scheme.  You might die.

Marketing inside the echo chamber of Reddit and "crypto currency communities" isn't marketing, it's circlejerking.
We're talking about the tools to help people move money with confidence and comfort.  When a guy in Belarus wants to move $10,000 without getting a border guard shakedown, does a bunch of millennials squawking memes at him provide any help whatsoever?  No.  He doesn't care about "the community" or whatever goodwill you're generating by tipping people 69 doge ironically, he wants to be secure in the knowledge that the technology and network is going to function as advertised.
Dogecoin was never meant to be taken seriously, so why do you guys get so upset when you aren't taken seriously?
And honestly, the massive downvoting coming from shibes toward ANY dissent about dogecoin really undercuts your theme of unity and world peace.  Surely if your community is as strong as you claim, you can debate without the brigades.

The energy requirements for putting a satellite into geostationary orbit are huge, not to mention the on-board fuel required for station-keeping and other maneuvering over the life of the sat.  Plus, the satellite would need powerful radio and large antenna systems capable of transmitting back to the earth's surface 22,000 miles away.  This would eliminate the possibility that you could use "micro-satellites."
You'll need to use larger satellites in a lower orbit.  Most cubesats burn up after a year or two so you'll need to put them higher, give them more mass per unit of surface area, and launch them into several different orbital planes so they can speak with each other and the ground without much overlap.  The Iridium Constellation is the model you should be going for.
As with the Garzik idea, I think it makes more sense just to lease an existing Russian satellite platform already in orbit and run it as a node.

Your version of long-term is apparently different than mine.  How much software from the mid-90s will still run on your current setup?  How much old software and hardware to I have to keep on stand-by just to recover a backup?  Even if there's a small chance that I'm going to have trouble getting my coins out of an old non-standard Electrum wallet, why would I choose it over a wallet that is standards compliant?  Other than fanboyism, you really haven't provided a reason to use it over basic paper wallets.

This advice has a time horizon of about 12 months with the current rate of technological change.  If Bitcoin were around in 1985 and you kept your wallet on floppies, or tape, how would you read it now?  People have been keeping paper documents/currency/stock certificates safe for hundreds of years.  No need to reinvent the wheel.
After all, all you're trying to keep safe is essentially a very large number.

Extra long term means that you want something that will stand the test of time.  My biggest worry would be that one of the alternative clients out there would cease development and then you'd be stuck with a deterministic wallet structure not based on any standard like BIP32.  
This means no Armory, no Electrum, until they adopt a standard wallet format.  Until then, keep it simple with BIP38 paper wallets with copies in multiple locations.

If he's selling class iii laser modules that are uncertified (very common, say, from China) then he is in violation since the FDA has jurisdiction over laser products and certification must happen at some point in the supply chain.

Before you break your arm patting yourself on the back, you should re-calibrate your use of language here.  Specifically, your use, or abuse, of the word "trivial."  Something isn't trivial when it requires a lab setting and specialized equipment to pull off, especially when that equipment, knowledge, and desire also requires the possession of the physical device.  Oh, and an exploit isn't really trivial if it is responsible for the loss of exactly zero financial assets in the history of Bitcoin.

How does one determine who is elite enough to handle the responsibility of a brainwallet?
Since there is no margin for error, why trust something as error-prone as the human brain?  This argument usually falls on deaf ears in this sub because everyone is 19 years old and can't imagine their brains, or bodies, might someday fail them.
There's also a general marketing reason for discouraging the use of brainwallets.  Every time someone gets money stolen from one, the larger financial world adds one more strike against bitcoin in general.  They don't care that it was just some idiot using a quote from Family Guy to secure their wealth.

They're not going to validate everyone manually because half the people who don't qualify are shady un-banked criminals and the other half won't push enough money through Coinbase in their lifetimes to make the effort worthwhile.

I'm sure we could go round and round with this until we're discussing fraud rates of actual coin-op vending machine operators vs electronic vendors, etc, but that's not really the point.  My example was merely one of many possible ways that millions of daily transactions might make their way into the blockchain.  It would be better for our nascent currency if it could be more adaptable to this eventuality rather than 5 or 6 developers stomping their feet insisting that "bitcoin wasn't meant for that."  
People trust bitcoin itself, not third parties that get hacked or that might be run by various criminals or charlatans.  Every layer of abstraction that is placed above the blockchain is one more trust hurdle that may or may not be overcome.

Basically, and this is documented much better on bitcointalk, you need to establish "proof of age" by scanning an image of each coin.  You take that image file and generate a hash of it.  Then you take that hash and convert it into a bitcoin address.  You then send one satoshi to that address.  This proves that the image file of your coin existed on the date and time associated with the payment in the blockchain.  
This proves that your coin looked the way it did on that date, thus making it easier to prove that the coin wasn't tampered with.  You supply the image file to any potential buyers so they can run through the confirmation steps on their own to prove age.
Someone is even running a service that does everything for you:

Bitcoin enthusiasts are overly paranoid of the government coming to get them for any offense, even one that doesn't exist, like writing on currency.  The law is very clear that this doesn't qualify as defacing the currency.
