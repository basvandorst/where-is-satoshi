Someone already ate his left ball. You cant top that (not suggesting you should).
A tattoo is boring.
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:43:58
thanks! seems very useful!
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:07:33
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:18:11
can you elaborate on that?
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:41:21
I can tell you are not trying to be nice, and your second comment is much more constructive, I thank you for that.
and yes, the US government **STOLE** lots and lots of bitcoins from the regular Joes in the name of sizing the bitcoins of the bad guys.

like nobody knew. You want a cookie?
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:54:07
I am not sure you know what I mean.
Let me explain then...
It means all payments for oil should be done in Bitcoin and only in Bitcoin. Not in dollars or Yuans or any other currency.

Someone please give Grammar Nazi a cookie, make this user happy!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:17:06
Ive lost so much by buying and selling, that I am just about flat right now, no loses but also no bitcoins anymore.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:56:38
its fine with me. Im en Europe, not sure how it is somewhere else.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:12:17
not from Germany. for me it is 12 hours to 3-4 days. last time, 12 hours.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:57:00
Fck you!
just kidding. hope this is your lucky day.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:57:13
its all I got, not saying anyone has to use the same.
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:27:47
thanks. I see again and again this HODL instead of HOLD.
Can you explain what the joke or use of HODL is? is it just a funny way to say HOLD or is there anything else to know?
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:48:09
a nut is a nut, not a testicle  ;-)
and even if he said a testicle, it would be just nuts to do it.
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:35:34
I thought that might be the case. Thanks!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:23:51
Tesla is great, but not yet main stream.  But I think Elon Musk is so progressive, I could see that happen soon!!
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:31:53
dear mr nice guy. why do you attack my useless brain, and why do you say the US does not has my Bitcoins? if you are better informed regarding my bitcoin, please advice.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:30:51
and your 0.02 is the cause of THIS?!
When are you selling? please do that soon!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:14:34
hahaha, well, its funny I think. Specially since it sounds like porn  :P
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:22:02
thanks! we will see.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:59:39
*face palm*.
do you know what role the petro-dollar plays in the world stage?
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:12:18
I am taking note, thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:12:36


12 hours for me last time. good enough
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:31:38
sure. 
when you say "Not sure it would make any sense though".... well, just google or look for youtube documentary on the Petro-Dollar.
I mean, I could "explain" you but I am honestly no expert, just as I could explain you what a Black Hole or the DNA is but honestly, i know shit.
Please go for google or youtube. I assure you it is a huge deal.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:08:25
I didn't know I had any followers/fans/stalkers   :D
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:08:20
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:07:51
they already do, and they are not what we call "main stream" I think.
Games are great, but most people buy other stuff... like clothes and electronics.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:18:25
[This]( is all you get.
And stop being a Grammar Nazi. This was your last cookie.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:29:59
the US sized BTC-E because there was money laundry. 
They DO NOT size banks when the case is the same, but thats a different story.
So they did it and BTC-E was able to keep "safe" 45% (or 55%, not sure) of our bitcoins. That part we got back, so like 50%... but the rest was stolen by the US government.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:12:46
you don't get to make any demands when you get a reward. if any, I encourage some one to give you a pic of a cookie at most.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:28:34
I am afraid of having it on my phone and then my phone brakes and I loose all.... I am not that informed as how to keep it really safe
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:56:59
look for local bitcoins. there are people selling, meeting up in cafes and public places
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:21:39
Its never late. It is definitely not early. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:33:04
Same for you. Why don't YOU click HIDE post instead of b*tching around?
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:11:21
Mine was usually 4 days too. last time, it was only 12 hours, so lets hope!
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:57:12
I "think" it is accepted for games, which is great.
But we want to buy food, and clothes, and electronics and stuff... we want everyone to be able to use Bitcoin for what we need daily.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:33:59
YOU click HIDE post and stop b*tching!
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:42:03
this one is a bit better, thanks. The price of BTC will go super high, that is for sure, but not the oil.
Not sure though.
The thing is, the higher BTC is, the less oil costs. I mean, oil costs the same.
Say you want to exchange 1 barrel of oil for 2 pizzas (or 20 if you want). Pizzas cost what pizzas cost, and so everything else in the world. The higher the BTC, the less of BTC it will cost to buy a barrel of oil and exchange it for your 2-20 pizzas.
If the price of oil increases, then the price of BTC Decreases.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:11:55
Ive got some issues trading, but it always works at the end.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:04:45
can you talk more about the correction. What is it corrected?
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:52:58
when BTC went up to 700 I bought, then it crashed to 200. I bought and sell until I got some 85% back, sold to go on vacation.
The very last time, I bought at 5500€, got happy at 7000€, it crashed to 4800€, I sold in panic, bought BCH at 2500€, in 15 mins, IN FRONT OF MY EYES it went down to 1200€ (BCH), finally decided to get back in to bitcoin after its recovery at 6000€ and then again at 7600€ (I should have never switched to BCH) and now I am finally back to even...
But I no longer have 7BTC, but a little under 1BTC
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:33:01
what about they control the exchanges? like they close them and/or forbid any company from trading bitcoin for goods and services?
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:56:04
I guess I can agree on similarly lacking, i do not pretend to be very smart.
ok, the thing with the petro dollar is that oil controls the world. Since oil is ONLY sold in dollars, the US is able to PRINT dollars and get money for FREE. This way, it has financed its military adventures around the glove and fund its R&amp;D and its economy.
IF oil was sold in Bitcoins, not one single country would be able to manipulate the market by printing money, since Bitcoin is decentralized. 
I do not know if there are any Petro Bitcoin videos, but following my thinking shouldn't be so hard (I think, I might be delusional though).

This was weed growing a few years ago, I think in the Netherlands, could be wrong though. But it was 100% a weed bust, and again, a few years ago.
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:24:09
its nice when you have tenths or hundredths of BTC... what about when you have... only 1?
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:14:04
he said BALL, not testicle... Im sure there is a catch, and i wish him 10 MILLION views on youtube!
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:03:17
what do you mean by epic?
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:07:07
don't know them. sounds like porn though.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:24:16
Just because you are an old user who "has seen it all" here, doesn't mean you get to tell people what to ask and what not.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:38:20
what do you mean "your seed", I do not pretend to be an expert, so sorry if stupid question.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:25:19
looking fwd to see that happen.
I wonder if China will beat them to that.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:39:43
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:11:00
seriously... I didn't get most of what you wrote.
sorry. I tried to make sense of it, but I fail.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:19:09
ok, this will be fun to read... thanks
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:03:41
you are still here??
