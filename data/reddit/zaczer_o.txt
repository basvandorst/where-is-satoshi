They don't know how much BTC you have. He's saying that many (even the simplest ones) implement lots of tracking features. With each extra app installed on your phone you decrease your privacy. It's possible to create your virtual profile based on what apps you have installed (all you have to do is purchase details they collect). Also each extra app is draining your battery more and more. I'd suggest you uninstalling that app and just making a bookmark with BTC price in your browser. It's just few clicks away. Keep only apps which are crucial for your daily life\~

You should check the fees from past transactions and see if they really were 2 sat/byte.
Like you can't do anything now about that but it would be cool to check why it's taking more time than usual ;)

So the money was gone 8 months before that person died?  
No-one noticed that they were without money for almost a year?  
Also why crack the encryption when you can just find the address on blockchain explorer and check the balance.  
I don't buy it.

It depends on how high the transaction fee is brother. Higher fee = faster transaction
@_date: 2019-03-13 18:50:13
This is probably because of the low transaction fee.  
So BTC got something called transaction fees that are customizable (by you/your wallet).  
And the way it works is pretty simple:  
\* low transaction fee = hours, days for transaction to go trough  
\* high transaction fee = minutes, hours for transaction to go trough  
Find your transaction in blockchain explorer and check the fee it has.  
Here's a nice website:

For example 27 sat/byte would go trough in under 60 minutes :)

I really like the idea :)
Also those cards look sick !
@_date: 2019-03-15 07:45:43
Yes, I'll try to spread some of the awareness at school :P Price is really affordable too (when you get free shipping)

You can't change the fee but there are transaction accelerators as someone mentioned in this thread.  
You should give it a try.  
First of all no worries.  
You will get your money earlier or later :P  
Also as you mentioned transactions going through in 3-6 mins with such a low fee (ultra rare).  
Transactions with 0.1$ go for \~40 mins? - depends on network load.  
I got an idea what could actually happen.  
If you sent the transaction to other wallet on the same service (for ex. [blockchain.com]( \-&gt; [blockchain.com]( it went trough almost immediately as they 'confirmed' it across their internal network (database).  
But when you sent the money to different wallet (for ex. [blockchain.com]( \-&gt; bitpay) they don't share the same infrastructure and they can't verify it in 'faster' way than waiting for btc confirmation (that's why you are stuck now).

9925$ oh gosh I can feel it already. After 10k it will be going up like a crazy :D
@_date: 2019-06-21 11:58:00
I agree.
1. Not your keys not your Bitcoin and 
2. No segwit support in 2019
@_date: 2019-02-20 22:15:26
It's more convenient for me to access the same wallet from mobile and pc. That's not the point of this post anyways.
@_date: 2019-02-25 20:20:30
On view transaction details you will probably get the block id. Just use any block viewer and you will find the fee used.

Now let's go for 100,000$ :D  
Take over the world Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-02-20 21:07:29
Yeah, I'm already looking into changing my wallet. If I ever sell BTC again I will do it directly through Coinify or any other service. Fucc those guys.

"add and remove from my blockchain account"
Then simply create wallet on blockchain.com (and optionally export it)
No need for paper wallet as you upload the private key anyways
I suggest you abandon the paper wallet idea as it's good only as a gift for a friend :) For small amounts use mobile wallets (there are few trusted out there) and then purchase a hardware wallet.

Let's do it
@_date: 2019-04-20 11:20:21
Thanks, I'll use this one.  
I just wanted to give some bitcoin to a complete newbie :)  
Private key on paper seems as a good idea.

 I like how easy it is to manage multiple wallets and exchange currencies :) There are lots of integrated services.
