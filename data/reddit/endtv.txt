I like them, I've used them for hosting for 6 years and had very little trouble.  I don't care if they don't take BTC - many worthy companies don't yet.

Sounds very much like an inside job

A delusion is a belief you continue to cling firmly to despite being contradicted by reality.   Laissez-faire is a perfect example of such a belief.   It's never existed in history, yet you're convinced that you can achieve it, and the rules that govern others do not apply to you.

Except Dr. Seuss is actually [pronounced like it rhymes with "voice", not "loose"](   So better delete your account now, it's the right thing to do.

pastebin is where someone leaked it, obviously, not where it was originally posted.

PSA - How to back up your Google Authenticator
Take a screenshot of the QR code/private keys at the time you create the two-factor auth.   Print it out, and lock it in your fire safe or safety deposit box.   Or save it as a file in a TrueCrypt volume, store the keys in Keepass or LastPass, etc.   Just don't NOT back it up.

Invest $1k now, and when BTC hits $1000, you'll be happy you didn't sit around waiting for $0.05

Unless you bought your miner with bitcoins, then immediately bought more bitcoins to replace the ones you spent.

That's a nice platitude, but it's neither logical nor reasoned.   Suppose someone ties you up and removes you from your property by force, then moves in.   Will you ask the government to enforce your property rights if you aren't powerful enough to?

I used to buy CC all the time as a kid - I loved the teardrop bottle!   I'll definitely order some with BTC

The market is not static.   Big purchases drive the price higher, and cause sellers to revise and place new sell orders.   In short, you could not buy all the BTC that is for sale on mtgox at any given moment, because more will be offered immediately at higher and higher prices until you stop buying.

There is no freedom like what you describe, simply because no individual is strong enough on his own to protect his life and property from all of those who wish to take it.   The only way to preserve your freedom is to band together against the wolves, or become a wolf yourself.

Well I bought mine in single digits, so double there
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:16:30
@_date: 2013-04-07 16:53:39
Well, I stole some of the ones you mined, so there.

It's one of those tricky end user license agreement situations.   Your consent to be governed is implied by your voluntary continuance of residence and citizenship.   By installing this software, you agree to be bound by its terms and conditions etc.   if you wish to enjoy some of the advantages of a community, you must necessarily lose some amount of freedom.  That is the price.   You can settle on some unclaimed or yet undiscovered island and be truly free, untaxed and ungoverned,  but is it worth losing the benefits of living in a modern society?

Yet here you are safely posting comments on the internet from a device and bandwidth paid for by government issued currency, in a jurisdiction managed and policed by government, probably eating food inspected for safety by the government.  You agree to be governed all right, you're doing it right now.

I'll send your drive to a professional data recovery lab (drive savers) and cover the total cost if you'll reimburse me from the BTC recovered and make it worth my time.

I bought 1BTC from coinbase, and it took about five days to show up.   I sent it to my wallet, and an hour later, it's still sitting in coinbase.  wtf?

You're a bit of an asshole
