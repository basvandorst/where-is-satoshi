Well, what if I'm a believer and I don't have the money to buy the product?  How do I get to "express that view" ??

that's similar, but what i'm remembering is a gif where the price from 2009 stays the entire time and it expands slowly to the right.

At no point did I say I was looking for an illegal method to avoid paying my taxes.  I'm curious if there are legal methods of reducing my tax bill that are written into the tax code that I'm not aware of.  Its not unethical for homeowners to deduct their mortgage insurance, and its not unethical for farmers and fisherman to use income averaging.  If there's something in the tax code that could save me money, that's fair game.

I don't think I can retroactively setup an LLC for 2017, but I'll keep this in mind to look into for the future.  Thanks!

I definitely would be better off in terms of quality of advice, but worse off in terms of cost of professional help. :)  I'm happy to do the research and read the tax code if I know what to look for.  I'm hoping some other redditors have already paid for the professional advice and could share that knowledge, or at least some keywords.  But from what I'm seeing, there's really not anything available.  I'd hate to go spend another $1k to have a professional tell me that...
