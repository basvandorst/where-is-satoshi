I'm only good at one of those things... :(

Well said!

This was my sort of default answer as well, but it left a bad taste in my mouth! It seems like a sort of irrational approach to the currency, and I feel like it won't ever "catch on" until people have a rational reason to use it rather than support it because they want it to succeed.

We don't currently have the infrastructure to track the location of a given pair of shoes at all times. And even if we did, we have no way of correctly linking the owner to the current person using the pair of shoes.
That being said, I'm not disagreeing with you in principle, but your analogy is a big stretch. Your whole post/title is essentially a loaded statement that ignores what real complexity there is surrounding this issue.
@_date: 2014-05-02 17:03:38
How so?

In all fairness, this is true for nearly every community with a large enough userbase.

Being a long-time customer doesn't make him entitled to anything. They don't owe him anything different than a brand new customer. 
@_date: 2014-05-02 17:07:01
Is this necessarily true though? We haven't seen much use of bitcoin on a large scale, yet we've seen it's value rise from less than a dollar to over 1200$ at some point.
@_date: 2014-10-23 17:30:45
Tell me then. What exactly are long time customers entitled to? A cheaper product? Faster service? In the OP's case is he entitled to the business not making mistakes 100% of the time?
@_date: 2017-02-03 16:36:55
Its about the value of the BTC. For example, if you bought an ounce of gold 10 years ago, you'd still have exactly 1 oz today, but the value in dollars would change.

By watching his content you are gaining value. What you give back to him (and how much) is the value you give him in return.
Giving him nothing in return seems a little selfish to me. Legally? I don't know, but it certainly seems morally wrong.

I never meant to attack you, so I'm sorry for that. I was specifically interested in where you said that artists should not be compensated for digital copies.

Whenever the content is decided by upvotes and downvotes, the quality of the sub drops. Quicker-digested posts and low-effort content always quickly drown out the high-effort content, and the sub turns into what and became:
This is what happens when you let upvotes and downvotes decide what content should be here.

So if two brothers start a pyramid scheme together, it's no longer a pyramid scheme?
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:21:51
Fair point. Let me explain. Banks can't send out fiat that never existed. They loan out capital that they hold in reserve for someone else.
For example, if I have $5000 in the bank, they can loan out most of that sum to other people. So technically the 5000$ of mine isn't "in" the bank, but it does exist. They didn't just make it out of thin air. And the same would be true of bit coin.
They wouldn't loan out BTC that never existed, but rather they would loan out BTC that is given to them to hold.

This isn't how banks work at all.

A dimaryp scheme if you will.

I think he agrees with you. 


His comment basically sums up what you were saying when you told that guy to MAKE the script himself, rather than insult others. Ideas are easy, executing them is hard.
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:29:41
Fair point! I was being overly pedantic-  with only a reminder that truth will never be objective.


In this context, I have to agree. My understanding is that what Fox News did wasn't even journalism: the investigator's source was actually another Fox News reporter.
In this case, there really weren't any facts, and the 'truth' was mostly fabricated. This is as "fake" as it gets.
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:04:24
Pardon me for jumping in here.


Yes, and truth is not the same thing as facts. Facts alone cannot tell the whole story, especially when most of our news organizations pick which facts to include in the discussion.

This. If I ever get into bitcoin, it will be to USE it, not for investing purposes.
@_date: 2016-05-21 16:51:54
For free checking accounts in the U.S., you don't pay per transaction, but rather you lose out on earning interest on the money the bank keeps.
You aren't paying directly, but you are paying one way or another.


These are subsidized by users who carry a balance from one month to the next.

Agree 100%. But even if it's intended, it's still a cost. (Opportunity cost).
@_date: 2013-07-15 09:55:25
Yes, it's called **DE**flation. Overtime bitcoins will become worth more and more, such that a hotdog that costs 2 bitcoins today will cost .002 bitcoins 2 centuries from now (wildly exaggerated numbers).
@_date: 2013-07-15 09:57:11


Can you link me  to information about this? I'm interested to learn about how expanding currency supply equates to taxation!
@_date: 2013-09-05 21:04:03
@_date: 2013-07-15 19:36:49
It also means that it's vitally important to invest! Because having 10 bitcoins today, means that if you invest them to net yourself 20 bitcoins tomorrow, you're EVEN more well off than if you were to just hoard them.
As far as inflation goes, I'm finding conflicting information as to whether it encourages investing or not, so I really don't know.
@_date: 2013-07-16 20:07:26


That's not what I'm saying. Investing in the market should net a higher profit than deflationary increase in your pocket. If this is not the case, then you have bigger problems in your market than the money supply.
@_date: 2013-07-15 19:55:06
Thanks for the link and explanation!

Refunds cost businesses quite a bit, I'd imagine, so I don't see this as being unfair unless they retroactively deny refunds for those that pre-ordered before this change.
@_date: 2013-06-08 10:43:42
I'm just starting to read up on Bitcoin, but this is how I imagine it works. Both 1$ transactions are being broadcasted to the Bitcoin network, so the second transaction (assuming it's the same dollar) will be rejected by the blockchain.

We're not sure exactly what e-bay is going to do with this. That being said, check the top thread in right now. They've added virtual currencies or something
