Nah, using money as an incentive with the idea that you can just put (x) amount of money into any human interaction decision making to affect the outcome in a way you find desirable is gross.  That has already happened so much in this trial, even at its very core with market for illegal drugs.  The entire thing is a mess, or maybe its just we humans that are fucked up.

Just an innocent life being randomly incentivised to take risk where others won't?  IDK, I guess your words are true when you say, sad but effective. Can't hide from the truth.

 I see what you mean now.  It would be nice to have undeniable proof of what happened.  Funny I have been into the tv shows Game of Thrones and Vikings.  While watching certain episodes I was thinking, these people have such primitive legal setups.  Then I really started to think about it, and I was like, is a jury at all any different than a mob?  Legal scholarship obviously isn't my trade, but I do understand your desire for truth. I just wish such incentives didn't have to be monetary.

Yes, I don't see how an economic collapse would effect bitcoin.  Why would anyone sell their bitcoin for worthless paper currency?  If nobody sold their coins, the price would rise.  Whether the price would rise perfectly with inflation is yet to be determined, but as long as overstock was still accepting bitcoin, and miners are still mining, the bitcoin economy would wrok.  Just as long as day traders didn't fuck it up, and continue selling for the same amount of dollars even though the dollar value decreased, which I don't think would happen.

The author, David Seaman, god that guy.  Does anyone know what's his deal?  I can't figure out if he is completely confused and used by Bryce Weiner, or being paid by alt coins for pumping.  He had tons of "nautiluscoins are up x amount" tweets, then the dump, and then nothing.  No tweet about Naut being down x percent, just a blanket statement saying you could make money or lose money.  He keeps searching for the "next bitcoin" making myspace and facebook comparisons, and I just have to put my hand over my head.  He barely understands that bitcoin is the network, and services like coinbase are the twitter/facebook.myspace.  I really like the guy and was a big fan before he even knew about crypto, but jeez Seaman, get it together man.

Idk, I pretty much dominated the lower limits, they were not very good players.  I more than tripled my stack and moved up in less than a week playing very low limits (cents)after depositing $40 worth bitcoin.  I think the higher limits, there are just less people, so they know each other.  Its still possible though, I wouldnt look at my experience and say it applies to everyone.

Good points, but just remember, bitcoin has basically been in a decline since the cex.io fiasco, and that canadian bitcoin developer sold all or half his coins.  Could have gone back up to 800 or something, if it wasn't for that ghash crap, and their great public relations department.

Hey llogy,  Thanks for your post.  I agree that proof or work is far superior to proof of stake.  I also agree that steps that can be taken to decentralize mining are good for bitcoin.  I am optimistic that the future will see multiple large scale mining firms in different countries and contitents.  My optimism is predictated on mining pools now understanding data about how  consolidation can affect market sentiment and their profits.
 
   One thought I would like to contribute to your point is the idea of assessment.  If one assumes that the price of btc is indicative of how people in the community see the future of bitcoin playing out, an abnormal finding can change the community assessment of bitcoin. This is true especially in the short term.
  For instance Peter Todd found this abnormal ghash data to be very negative and expressed it by selling.  Andreas Antonopoulus assessed the the ghash information completely differently than Todd and came to the alternate conclusion that bitcoin was not in danger. We don't know the true feelings of the community until after time has passed.  I believe now, pools will be very unwilling to treat a 51% approach in the same manner.  Pools know 51% affects their profits.  Therefore I believe market is begining to change. Plus bear whale is gone.

  As a journalist and former political candidate you are a public figure, and the public is free to comment on your work.  If you detour from politics, and move into the realm of asset speculation, you have to accept that the positive and negative noise may grow louder.  It is your right to cover whatever subjects you choose in whatever fashion you choose to present them, but as a member of the public I also have a right to comment on that work.  You must accept the seriousness of your subject matter.  You are promoting assets which are particularly volitile with pictures of astronauts, and giant stacks of money.
 I enjoy a lot of your political perspectives, but I do not agree with the way you present your alts.  I do not have a personal grudge against you, I was a fan long before you got into crypto, and I will stop critizing your coverage of alts.  I do not wish for you to fail.  But I hope you will consider some of these points, and the gravity of advising people on money allocation.  I wish you the best and good luck in the future.

I heard about bitcoin in 2013 and for the first time stumbled across words like open source, and distributed systems. 6 months later I decided to use Linux.  I am pissed off and amazed that nobody in school taught me about Linux, especially considering everything is FREE!  This BLOWS MY MIND.  Schools have budgets and they are worried about keeping up with the next windows release! Why dont they just use linux, what the hell is wrong with these people?
Also, used an old dell mini from 2010 that was destroyed with mcaffee and crap.  Installed linux, and it runs just fine now. Showed my dad a streaming MLB game and he goes, "that's Linux!" I had to install pipelight and the browser disguise onto this old dell mini so that I can use a program my school bought requires silverlight! Cost of program that requires silverlight, $270 each semester for the next course of material.

Perhaps they will report people to law enforcement, or ruin your credit rating.  This might be why they want strict regulation over bitcoin.  The only way you could get away with it is if the card is stolen,  but that is an entirely different ball game.

Impossible to know.  The total number of ether is related to the amount of btc in the crowdfunding.  I think the price will rise once it is released, and you should sell.  Buy back in later.  Every coin release follows the same path of a price run up and decrease.  When I got into bitcoin I got learn't this the hard way.  Most people do.  I brought into neo and bee, a bitcoin company.  Stock went up and then down, I sold at a loss.  It happens.  
In my opinion early btc adopters are risk takers by nature, and there are some people who have made a lot of extra money, even if they brought at 300, the beginning of the run up. As a result there are a lot of investments going around.  I would be very conservative with your bitcoin.  There is a very low, miniscule chance that something comes along better than bitcoin and everyone switches over, and all the business, overstock, newegg, dell, expedia, switch over.  But that chance is so small its practically non existant.
TL DR: Sell on the run up.  Buy back in months later if you like the coin.  My advice for what its worth.

Probably because the video starts with like 30seconds creating an uncessary reason why bitcoins don't work because of mining.

I sort of have to agree here.  Bitcoin has opened my eyes to many different philosophies and I am very grateful for that.  I have enjoyed learning about anarcho-capitalism, ayn rand, and Austrian Economics.  However because of bitcoin I have also stumbled across Paul Craig Roberts.  I believe the first time I heard him speak was on Stefan Molyneux's youtube channel.  It was not in that particular interview, but in subsequent interviews that Roberts made convincing arguments against Laizze-fair capitalism.  Here is a link to his best interview, one that Roberts himself describes as a "Five Star Interview."

Disagree: the security of bitcoin is based on more efficient asics, and efficiency not a directly correlation to the price.  Bitcoin mining would evolve whether the price per btc was $25.00 or $1000.00  (Asics/mining evolution) correlates to time. Bitcoiners are not directly funding Asics research, and just because we have a higher price does not mean we have more Asics research engineers per capita. I would argue that utility and social awareness correlate to the price of bitcoin.

We should remember that some of the most prominent people in bitcoin are baby boomers, Draper, Byrne.  We should also remember that the baby boomers slogan when they were young was "don't trust anyone over 30," so if you want to avoid the problems of the previous generation a good place to start is not calling for blanket generational movements. 
Perhaps just criticize the programs.

Doubt the gold reasons factor into bitcoin because bitcoin is still a smaller market.  Price decrease more likely has to do with bitcoin economics, the distribution rate of bitcoin related to the quick run up NOV 2013 (to early to sell 25btc as well as natural price discovery, which something you don't get in the stock market.
So if an early adopter becomes bearish, and decides to sell a large portion that was purchased  a coin, that can sink the price short term.  Most likely the price will have a similar correction as seen in the 400 to the-640 range a couple months ago from mid april-late june.

Give us your bitcoins and euros and we give you bro coins. Sure, but why not just give poker pros a stake in the company, use bitcoin as a currency.  That way pros are incentivised to mention and play at the site.  Plus you don't have to create your own currency!  Not only do you have to start a successful business, but you have to start a currency simultaneously.  It makes success twice as difficult.  Plus Americans can't play and you get no btc recognition.  This flaw seems obvious, but you have to be smart to put this bro coin all together.  idk.

I believe that is the goal, for it to be easy to program, and ether is needed to run contracts.  There is a good thread on bitcoin talk, and a reddit ether. Check out this video to get some more opinions.

Currency is just the first app.  Personally I find the idea of a token that goes up and down that i can exchange for fiat completely boring.  Think about windows being visa, and linux being bitcoin.  You are basically buying stake in a decentralized payment network that has characteristics that differ from the status quo network.  Its also better than gold at being gold.  The rest you have to research.

I understand the libertarian argument for sweatshops, and I agree with the position ideologically in a capitalistic society.  However, I am starting to reckon with the fact that I will never see a decrease in the growth of government in my lifetime.  Furthermore, evidence suggests that the United States is a fascist country run by oligarchs, and on top of that we don't even have sound money.  
I have considered that in order to make rational decisions, one must make them in the paradigm in which one exists, and it would be illogical to make decisions that would work in a libertarian society in a fascist society.  Furthermore, because immigrants vote democrat, and because democrats expand government, restricting illegal immigration is must in order to decrease government growth and entitlements despite the fact that its anti libertarian.

I have to partly disagree here.  I think bitcoin is political.  I have limited time to review bitcoin.  I do so because I find it fascinating, enjoyable, creative etc.  Since my time is limited I look to talking heads to summarize recent issues and events.  Thats not to say I don't think critically about the issue they are presenting, but rather that my time is limited, and a video is more efficient for me.
 Furthermore there are a lot of talking heads in the bitcoin/altcoin/cryptocurrency space that I wouldn't trust for a second.  Andreas is not one of them, I do trust his opinion,  and I go to him and others to get a summary of issues, mostly to satisfy my curiosity. I don't always agree, but my behavior within bitcoin towards wallets, security, company awareness or endorsement, is greatly affected by their opinion.  So far it has served me well as I have been able to avoid the occasional bitcoin scam artist, and have not lost or had any coins stolen.

Yearly is better for now.  Besides, there is not a lot to talk about with a mainstream audience.  Sidechains and 1mb block size isn't going to make for an interesting show.  The first time Andreas went on the big news was you can buy a computer with bitcoin.  But in real world tangible main stream audience things, not a lot has changed.  Maybe if sidechains or 10mb blocks were ready, and bitcoin could offer a solution to greece, and soon to be italy, ireland, spain.  But off the top of my head I just can't think of what could fill up 3 hrs.  Rogan has said himself that he believes in crypto currency, but you have to think from a production point of view.

I agree, but increasing labor supply to decrease wages seems to me to only work if labor can be replaced by higher quality jobs in the outsourcing country.  The unemployment rate is at currently 23% calculated with Reagans formula which was the historical standard until Clinton changed it.  I'm not old enough to know what it was like for a house to cost 2.2 years the mean American salary, where now a house cost 10 years the mean salary.  It seems the standard of living only decreases if you don't account for deflationary technology.   I think it could be entitlements from workers that no longer have a job that lead to gov spending and inflation in the cost of living.

You have to READ the white paper.  Its not long, and you can skip the technical parts, and you can still understand the intent of bitcoin's creator(s).  If 1mb is not raised people have to pay more to use that 1mb of space, its supply and demand regarding space (sort of like real estate market).

I do find some flaw with the logic in this video.  
 mark he asks, "who should suffer? Not me, I have been raising awareness for 30 years."
 " It has to be the responsibility for those who have a voice in public affairs.  In a democracy the wonderful thing is that everybody of voting age is responsible for what happened.  Not all equally, and people vote for different people and so on. But activism is very powerful, you want to get this person impeached, get this person thrown in jail, you can do civil disobedience you can do lots of things now."
This is a contradiction in Libertarian ideals, particularly when you look at abortion.  Everyone has a right to life on an individual level.  I feel like Stefan is making a switch about rights, and grouping people when talking about paying for social wrongs.  Is it right to take an innocent life to save a 10,000? If no, than it is wrong to take the savings and pay the price with suffering because you are an old person, even though you voted against such irresponsible policies. 
Besides that point, I really do enjoy Molyneux's economic (not social commentary) videos, and have his videos as well as Voorhees, Jeffrey Tucker, and Schiff to thank for teaching me economics and liberty.  
@_date: 2015-07-21 01:28:07

2. Technically the fees should be low enough to keep with Satoshi's original vision.

I'll respectfully take a stab at it.
It is true that gold has a long history and therefore a larger network than bitcoin.  However, the reason that gold has this network is because it had monetary properties that were unique to this world.  Until bitcoin's creation there was never anything that existed which could compare to gold's unique economic utility.  Bitcoin is the first attempt to improve upon gold's economic utility. 
 I think there is evidence to suggest that unique aspects of gold that are essential for economic activity have all been improved upon, and therefore gold may become obsolete. 
If Silicon valley can disrupt the following industries... 
...then there is no reason why gold should have some special exemption.
The only aspect that was not recreated was gold's physical characteristics.  Therefore bitcoin (if successful) reduces gold to its physical properties - a shiny malleable metal.  The main argument for gold's continued financial relevence revolves around the regression principle.  In repsonse to such an argument I'll piggy back off of Tracy Mayer and Erik Voorhees

My opinion is that you are observing pavlov's dog theory.  As the price rises people salivate, and for good reason.  Nothing wrong with wanting to be fed. The rug gets pulled out from underneath and the price drops.  However, the last time that happened with coinbase's announcement the price dropped to 217ish i believe.  Here we are at 230ish.  Hopefully this price holds, and then as we rock back and forth we have momentum upwards as new holders come on board and don't dump at a loss.

Adam Back and Gregory Maxwell did a recent hangout where they described the harm in altcoins.  I am with these guys and although I love Andreas and his talks, I do not agree with him for a second about altcoins. Especially his speech in the texas bitcoin conference when he said bitcoin would have 50-60% of the market cap roughly/maybe.  I don't think crypto works as a monetary asset or currency in that situation. I am from the camp that sidechains are necessary if bitcoin is going to succeed.  Here is a link to the Maxwell/Back video, the first half outlines why alt coins are generally bad.
