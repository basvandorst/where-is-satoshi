Nah, the price drop has nothing to do with that. That's just esoteric stuff that nobody cares about. It's because of the Bitfinex hack. Think about how huge that is. It generated another wave of really shitty publicity for Bitcoin, and it wiped out a large amount of wealth and trader confidence. I'd say it's set us back a good six months to a year in terms of price growth.

I've been in since early days and I'm a holder of a decent amount. I support Bitcoin as a censorship-resistant digital bearer asset, and I'm glad that the Core developers share that vision. I am definitely far from alone in this. 
It's also pretty amusing that you would view participation from the likes of Adam Back and Bram Cohen, both esteemed contributors in the space of distributed computing, as a bad thing. I would say that that yes - they probably do know a thing or two about what's best, certainly more than a good hearted but intellectual lightweight like Roger Ver.

The allegations regarding certain Foundation board members and whether or not they had privileged access to the Mt Gox trading system, or whether or not they knew about its impending collapse and didn't act on it are just that - allegations. Allegations that were made by some screeching attention seeker who calls him self "two-bit idiot", which is perhaps the only honest thing about his reporting.
Mt. Gox was a private company, so insider trading rules don't apply. Further, the directors of a private business association (the Foundation) have no fiduciary duty to anyone outside of the association. They are under no legal or ethical obligation to do anything except serve the interests of their members and execute their charter.
By the way, it costs 25 lousy bucks to join the Foundation. For that exorbitant price, you too will have access to their super secret illuminati files that detail how they plan to destroy Bitcoin.

It's a cost issue. To 51% attack Bitcoin, you would need to come up with enough specialized hardware and power to generate around 40 quadrillion (40,000 TH/s) double-SHA256 operations per second.
Coinometrics currently estimates that cost to be around $991M USD:

But let's assume that you're Intel and you dedicate a chip run to the task, it would still probably cost around $100M. And who knows how high the hash rate would be by the time they ramped up production.

People have been saying this after every large business failure. MyBitcoin, Bitomat, Bitcoinica, and others. Each time this happens, someone says "How can anyone trust Bitcoin NOW?"
There's a difference between business risk and systemic risk. Mt. Gox was a horribly run business, and this was evident since it was hacked in spectacular fashion in 2011. There have been dozens and dozens of news stories and discussion threads since then explaining why you should NOT trust Mt. Gox. Keeping your deposits with Mt Gox was straight up gambling, and that was never a secret. 
Bitcoin the system keeps on truckin'. If you hold your own bitcoins, you will have lost nothing. That's the great thing about Bitcoin - decentralized trust! You don't have to trust anyone, just store them yourselves. It takes a little care to figure out how to do so, but if you know how to create a Reddit account, you have enough brain cells to read a HOWTO guide on how to secure your bitcoins.

It's as if someone came up to you and said "Hey, why are you angry? My god, you seem so angry, get a hold of yourself. I can't believe how angry you are!" And you try to explain how you're not angry, and then the guy says "whoa buddy, relax, jeez! What a hothead!"

MtGox used a poor method of verifying transactions, a method that was known to be unreliable for a very long time.  The Bitcoin system is fine and  is still humming along, and that's all I care about from the debacle. Bitcoin is about being a resilient decentralized value transfer system and that part remains strong. I don't worry when second-layer services fail.
As far as regulation goes, the situation is getting clearer as time goes by, which is good. Especially in the US. Clear statements by FinCEN and even the FBI that Bitcoin is not illegal and has valid uses are strong signals that Bitcoin will likely not be attacked by the government.
The financial regulatory landscape in the US has always been very thorny and is expensive to navigate. Only well-capitalized companies will be have the resources to setup exchanges that comply with all state and federal regulations. There are at least three companies that have this capability: Coinbase, SecondMarket, and Circle. Possibly CoinSetter as well.
If and when those companies activate licensed bitcoin exchanges in the US, watch out. They will utterly dominate the trade of bitcoins globally. With proper market makers and trustworthy derivatives markets, the price will stabilize and that will bring in a deluge of vendors. 
The future is very promising, which why I'm panic hodling.

Monero will attract the attention of legislators if it becomes too successful. It will be outlawed precisely because it doesn't provide any ability to trace illicit transactions. That is politically untenable and it will be banned. Monero's future is thus limited to dark markets. Not terrible, but it will never have Bitcoin's network effect and liquidity.

It's not a risk for long-term holders. I've been through wilder swings than this, but the price tends to wildly swing in an upwards direction over the long run, disaster after disaster. 
The naysayers don't understand that adoption is continuing to accelerate regardless of these big business failures. The bitcoin network doesn't care about those failures. New users keep buying bitcoins, VCs keep funding new startups, the media keeps covering Bitcoin the world over. The Mt. Gox debacle will fade in memory just like all the other high profile business failures.

You know, we've been hearing this for 8 years. Bitcoin isn't about super cheap payments, it is about decentralization and resistance to censorship.
@_date: 2017-03-31 04:14:30
Whatever. This has been the criticism since the first day. If an altcoin wants to be a high capacity semi-centralized database, well good luck to them. Bitcoin will continue to spread and gain adoption as the most censorship resistant p2p money for the Internet.
 Bitcoin needs to grow in safe, incremental steps that are supported by strong community consensus, otherwise the entire enterprise would be vulnerable to dimwits like Roger Ver and his zombie horde. 
Bitcoin is doing just fine resisting the forces of special interests and general stupidity. The other altcoins will face their own life-threatening challenges. Let them worry about theirs and we'll worry about ours.

Those early effusive evangelists, including Roger Ver, weren't technical and they didn't truly understand the various tradeoffs at play in Bitcoin. And they unfortunately sold people a bill of goods about what Bitcoin could do.
But some people did understand, people like famous cypherpunk Hal Finney - here's his insight on the subject from way back in 2010:

There was very little controversy beforehand that the forked chain would continue on as "ETH". The situation is quite different with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-27 01:21:26
LN doesn't change Bitcoin at all, that's ludicrous. LN is a mechanism for opening and closing a caching layer *using Bitcoin transactions*. It is Bitcoin. 
And only the technically ignorant would think that a money network like Bitcoin can grow entirely on a single layer. All networks must scale in layers, the internet being the finest example. 
If the "LN isn't Bitcoin" folks were in charge of the internet, there would be just the IP protocol, a much smaller internet, and a much smaller network effect.

The BU client requires 75% hashrate signalling I believe before it will allow large blocks. But as jerguismi says, the miners would be insane to create large blocks if the exchanges and other businesses are still running Core.
@_date: 2017-03-19 06:19:19
Pretty frustrating isn't it? There's been an army of sockpuppets here everyday now for weeks trying to tell us that miner-dictated consensus is good for Bitcoin, that SegWit is "not a blocksize increase" and is "too complex" (the most bizarre criticism ever, and it isn't even remotely true) and that we should "compromise" with a group of people who feel that a 2MB hardfork is vastly superior to a 2MB softfork for reasons that can only be charitably described as ignorant.

@_date: 2016-06-29 06:39:14
It sounds reasonable. However, consider that Bitcoin has different goals and a different value proposition than something like a coffee shop.
A coffee shop only has profits in mind, and it can scale up its business by growing into larger and more numerous shops, a process which is understood and completely uncontroversial.
Bitcoin, in contrast, is trying to offer utility as a censorship-resistant digital bearer asset. If scaling haphazardly jeopardizes the thing that makes it special (decentralization) then it's game over for the entire experiment. This is why many of us feel that transaction capacity must take a back seat until we absolutely nail decentralization.  
@_date: 2017-01-20 21:59:05
I'm not sure you've got that correct. The fork was due to a bug in BerkeleyDB, not LevelDB. 
@_date: 2017-01-16 22:25:47
I agree. (Roger Ver and Co.) want Bitcoin to scale to Visa levels at the base layer for what are basically nonsensical reasons approaching religious dogma, centralization concerns be damned. 
I've actually seen these people arguing in favor of a small number of nodes  running from data centers. They don't understand what makes Bitcoin interesting, let alone care about its decentralized future.
We have a big schism here. I think it's time to split into two coins.

@_date: 2017-01-16 22:21:29
It implies exactly that if the fork is contentious. Are you not aware of the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic chain split? The "experts" claimed loudly that the minority chain would die quickly, but it did not. Why? Because the fork was highly contentious, and there was enough support to keep the old chain running (as "Classic").

@_date: 2016-12-08 05:43:44
The people making those early claims were misinformed, but they were very vocal and prolific (Roger Ver being one of them). There were plenty of critics of that line of thinking right from the get go, but they were drowned out in the forums by euphoric early adopters who wanted it to be true. Even Satoshi never claimed that Bitcoin would compete toe to toe with incumbent centralized payment systems.

It's not correct to say that PoS is pretty much proven while there are some pretty serious problems with it that, to my knowledge, remain unsettled.
Besides the "nothing at stake" problem (which gets handwaved away by supporters using delegates), there's the economic argument that all PoS schemes end up becoming a disguised form of PoW, except more complicated and fraglile.
@_date: 2019-04-30 14:57:53
A guy I work with had mined something like 2000 ETH as a hobby, but his wife was bent out of shape over the several thousand bucks he spent on the mining equipment, so she made him sell the ETH to earn a modest profit and recover the cost of the equipment.
Well, that wasn't too long before the 2017 crypto bubble. He missed out on somewhere north of $2M in gains. I knew this, and I knew he knew that I knew it, so I avoided the topic of the bubble with him, but I could tell he was fucked up about it.

I think BCH proponents were quite willing to go along with Wright because he was singing their song.

There's bottomless demand for low-fee transactions, and Bitcoin can't handle that without sacrificing its ability to remain decentralized!
 Incremental and efficient scaling steps (things like SegWit and Schnorr signatures) allow safe growth at the base layer, and second layer solutions like LN will solve the demand for cheap transactions without destroying base layer decentralization.
@_date: 2016-10-29 02:56:30

You have that backwards. Miners can be fired. What matters is the economic majority and the nodes that they control. If miners get our of line, the work function can be changed by the node operators, and the miners are dead in the water. 
Remember: it's the nodes that serve as the source of information about the system for the exchanges and businesses and other parts of the Bitcoin economy. This is why it's so critical that nodes can be run by as many individuals in as many different parts of the world as possible, and it's why the core development community is so determined to wring every last drop of efficiency out of 1MB before raising the limit.

Was functional for me... I paid 22 cents to get a transaction into the next block during the spam attack. My preference won out because I was willing to pay more. That's a very efficient resource allocation system - one that preserves its key value proposition, decentralization, over all other considerations. It's a beautiful system. 
@_date: 2016-10-27 02:07:00
It took me a while to come around, mostly because I had read and internalized Hearn's scaling wiki page which was taken as unquestioned gospel by the community for a few years.
I eventually came to accept the argument that decentralization is more important than transaction capacity, and that Hearn was dead wrong.
@_date: 2017-07-06 18:56:10
There's nothing risky about SegWit... even the miners agree that it's good tech. There's only a small minority of flat-Earthers, impervious to facts, who think otherwise.
@_date: 2017-07-22 08:49:01
2x has about a 1% chance of getting activated, and do you know why? Because they'll never get regular node users, including most of the businesses and exchanges, to defect from Core.
SegWit2x is the miners pretending that they had control over the process. But really it was BIP148 that forced them to play along. They couldn't resist throwing in a "requirement" for a 2x fork three months afterwards, but it has no teeth. 
In the end the user won because we got SegWit with no truly binding covenants for anything else, and so Bitcoin remains unmolested by special interests.
@_date: 2017-07-22 08:59:05
"Base block size" is no longer relevant and is in fact meaningless. We don't need to consider another blocksize increase from SegWit's 2.1MB avg, 4MB max until we let it run for several months to evaluate its effects.

My interpretation is that FinCEN is sending warnings to businesses that could be engaged in transmitting money. That would be exchanges or businesses like Casascius which issued physical bitcoin tokens (which apparently FinCEN views as a monetary instrument). 
I'm fairly certain that this doesn't apply to businesses which merely accept bitcoin in exchange for goods and services.
