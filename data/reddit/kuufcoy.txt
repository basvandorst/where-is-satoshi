+90% last year.  +35% so far this year.  (still have 4 months to go in 2016)
Let's face it.  Best performing currency 5 of 6 years.  On pace to become best performing currency for 6 of 7 years.
I'm thrilled that it's exploding in value this fast.  Many people around the world would give their left nut to have their money compounding at these rates.

I'm cool with it.  If you're that money hungry go get a second job.  Or a better one.
Plus diversify.  I recommend rental property.  Nice steady cash flow to offset the volatility of bitcoin.
It takes 20 years of hard work and saving to become an overnight success.  With bitcoin there's a good chance that can be reduced to 10-15 years.
Bitcoin is not a job and it's not some kind of magic money machine that grants you your every wish.
Perhaps you could go write some code.  Or start a Bitcoin business and tackle a tough problem that 95% of bitcoiners are too lazy to solve.
If not just sit back, smoke some mind rape you bought on alphabay, be patient and enjoy the ride.

Yes what is with all the anti-science coming from Roger Ver?
The guy has no ability to evaluate the technology and the implications of his proposed changes!
He actually tweeted recently that he's okay with centralizing bitcoin by turning it into PayPal 2.0
Fuck that.  Without transaction fees on the base layer, bitcoin dies.
The reward is rapidly depleting.  Does he think miners will work for free?
The devs know the blocks need to be increased at some point.  It's simply a matter of when.

"regular" people don't save much money anyways.  Fuck em.  They are regular for a reason.
All I care about is the big money elites.  If someone has a multi-million dollar portfolio, it's only a matter of time before they push a percentage our way.  
Why's everyone so pessimistic?  Bitcoin is up 35% in the first 3 quarters of 2016.  Fuck I'm thrilled.  It's outperforming the rest of my portfolio by leaps and bounds.
@_date: 2016-08-28 03:03:09
Yes but let's face it.  Magic internet money that just did 50x in a matter of months.  You'd have to be a nutjob to have bought a significant amount at that time.
You know the old saying.  Don't buy it because it tripled... buy it before it triples.

On the "dollar collapse"
Look- the international monetary system "collapses" every 40 years or so.  Of course it will happen at some point but I don't think that's the nightmare scenario the libertarians think it will be...
What's likely to happen is a black swan event that forces world leaders together in a bretton woods type event.  2 weeks later everything will be back to normal for the most part.
The IMF will probably step in and reinject the central banks with liquidity using the SDR, or Special Drawing Rights.  Who knows what that will do to the dollar and markets, but outright "collapse" is probably unlikely.
Higher taxes.  Probably some inflation at some point.  Few more banks go bust.  Some confidence is lost.  Negative Interest Rates.  Debt restructuring.  Another 50% correction in the stock market.
That's about as close to "collapse" as we will see.  All that shit is great for Bitcoin.

In the short term fungibility and scaling needs to happen.  Many people I speak to that are on the fence are butthurt by the trackability.  
Fungibility will help the dark markets which is the  killer app right now.  Lightning Network is also crucial so the “omg bitcoin cant ever scale” crowd will chill out.
Give it another year or 2 for Ethereum/Altcoins/Permissioned Ledgers to finally die out.  People are slowly waking up to the fact that Bitcoin is it.  
There's still a billion dollars worth of value sitting in Ethereum + other testnet scams.  That capital has to flow somewhere.  When they inevitably tank that value has to flow somewhere.  
Much of it may go back into fiat but certainly some of it will flow back into Bitcoin.  Every year the spread between Bitcoin and altcoins grows.
The Bitcoin ETF would be nice.  Extra liquidity means extra stability.  Many looking for an easy way to buy without responsibility.  Look what happened to gold after GLD was introduced.
I think 2 major psychological breaking points will occur within the next 5 years.  One is Bitcoins 10-year anniversary and the other is Bitcoin passing the price of gold.  
A single Bitcoin is 4000x more scarce than an ounce of gold, so I think this is likely within the next few years.  That's a major psychological checkpoint.
Let's face it.  Bitcoin has been the best performing asset on Earth for 5 of the last 6 years.  As long as it doesn't go under like $500 by EOY it will be the best performing asset for 6 of the last 7 years.  
We're doing quite well IMO and I'm perfectly happy with 10%+ returns most years.  A few more years of growth in the regulatory arbitrage side of things can easily keep things moving up for the most part.
Don't underestimate the power of Sex, Drugs, Gambling.  Those are all huge markets.  Betting on Bitcoin is like betting on the viability of those 3 vices.
Outside of those short-term factors, long-term I really think we need reputable, regulated, insured BITCOIN BANKS.  Most do not want to hold big money themselves.
Long-term we have some really unprecedented central bank experimentation that will drive growth.  ZIRP, NIRP, Bail-outs, Bail-ins, and just general market volatility are all great for Bitcoin.

yea good luck with that...  I'm sure convincing 7000+ nodes around the world to shoot themselves in the foot will be a walk in the park.  "Hey guys, ya know that multi-million dollar investment you made in a mining farm??  You should destroy your investment"
"Durrrrrr okay if you say so"

No thanks.  I like that Bitcoin is extremely hard to change.  To me that's a feature not a bug.  Proof-of-Vitalik and time-traveling transactions are for 16-year olds.
Personally I think segwit and other scaling methods will happen eventually.  I'm not suggesting that a shitcoin will replace bitcoin...
All I'm saying is that I don't see a nightmare scenario if no scaling happens.  If/when fees reach $5-10, litecoin might make a comeback but I don't see it ever replacing bitcoin-- only becoming a secondary currency for small-value transactions. 
Worst case scenario is that Bitcoin simply pushes out poor/cheap people.  If you want to be your own bank and take financial sovereignty and all that, $5 for a fee isn't shit.  Neither is $25.
Just curious to hear peoples thoughts on this hypothetical scenario I'm laying out.  For example, I'm curious what the maximum fee you would be willing to pay?
At what point does digital gold require digital silver?
How many people on Earth even have the technical know how or ability to do the abstract thinking necessary to get to Bitcoin Mountain?  I mean the world may only have 500 million-1 billion people that are smart enough to use Bitcoin anyways...  
Whats the minimum it would take to accomodate 500 million users?
@_date: 2016-12-05 13:18:34
haha yes thats the TRUE worst-case scenario...
@_date: 2016-12-05 13:04:33
Thanks for the detailed answer theymos.  I'm confident Bitcoin will scale, since all participants have the financial incentive to do so, however it's still an interesting thought experiment.
@_date: 2016-12-05 13:11:44
Thats an interesting viewpoint.  I figure Bitcoin still has use cases at $5-10 transaction fee.  Uncensored tx being 1 and 21m cap is 2.
  
Remember that gold has plenty of downsides.  Every time you buy or sell it's quite expensive.  Either way I'm confident it will scale, just a thought experiment..
@_date: 2016-11-20 19:40:18
For what it's worth: I vote for segwit.  
I'm not technical but I've done a bit of research as a layperson.  I like the conservative approach. 
So far I've invested 1 years savings.  I'd love to invest more (and I have a lot sitting on the sidelines), but my main concern right now is mining centralization.  
I'm concerned bigger blocks will kill decentralization.  Lets see how the system reacts to segwit and then consider another limit increase in the future.
If we want Bitcoin to be a "safe-haven" asset, I think we need to be careful and SAFE with the upgrades.
If Bitcoin continues to centralize it has no value to me (or anyone?).  Decentralization is the primary value proposition to me.

Possible dump into USD or bonds.  Or if a crisis starts in the Eurozone or China, overseas markets could dump into S+P/USD and turn it into a superbubble.  One things for sure it will be interesting to watch.  Get your popcorn
@_date: 2016-09-18 19:49:37
Price per coin is the wrong way to look at it IMHO.  The real way is to look at the Market Cap, which is around $10 Billion.
For instance, if you look at gold, you would see the price has increased about $200 this year.  $200 doesn't sound that impressive, but if you think in terms of Market Cap, you would see that $1 TRILLION has flowed into the yellow metal this year.
Because Bitcoin is still very illiquid, a "slow steady climb" is unlikely.  I think we will see sharp increases.  As Bitcoin crosses the price of gold, I believe there will be a psychological shift.  At around $1500, confidence will explode.
It may take a while to cross "the gold barrier", but when it does I expect to see an explosion in the price shortly thereafter, followed by a crash as early adopters diversify their risk.  
Once we pass gold, people will begin to realize that a single Bitcoin is 4000X more scarce than an ounce of gold.  Greed and Fear will drive the price into the 10's of thousands.

Look at the blue line on the chart shown.  That's the market price over the last 150 years.
Now observe the blue line from the beginning of the chart to 1913 (pre-Fed).  Notice the volatility of the market price?  See how it stays in a nice tight range?  No big swings up or down.  The market shows a nice steady increase over time.
Now look at the blue line after 1913.  See the increased volatility?  There's like 5 major booms and crashes after the Fed.
The market health is shown by the blue line.  When that blue line crashes, people lose jobs and retirement savings.  The length and frequency of recessions doesn't matter.  The only thing that matters is the blue line (the market).

Hmmm I see your point but to be honest I have no conclusion yet.  You would think all these swaps, options, derivitives would lead to a more stable stock market, but it doesn't appear to be the case.
Check out:
for further info.  They list various reasons for each recession, that you may find interesting.
I recently purchased about 10 books on the financial history of America and Europe, going back 500 years..  I plan on deep diving this weekend as long as they all arrive in time.  Once I'm done I'll make a post about it. 
For now I don't want to jump to any conclusions, until I have the time to consolidate all the facts.  Thanks for the interesting article and viewpoints though.  
@_date: 2016-09-24 00:55:35
Interesting points here guys.  Just want to point out that although recessions occur less often under the Fed, it would appear the market has also been wildly more volatile.  
Recessions are a normal, healthy part of the business cycle.  They will happen regardless.  What matters more, the frequency or the intensity?  This chart seems to indicate more overall stability before the Fed.  
Minor, frequent recessions may not be so terrible.  It cleanses out the mal-investment and the overleveraged.  Artificially postponing a recession may just make it that much worse when it does inevitably happen.

Imagine you take 2 camping trips, each a week long.  One on the east coast, one on the west coast.
East coast:  every few hours flies buzz around you and bite you.  You're a bit annoyed but you swat them away.  This happens frequently and lasts 10 minutes each time, but it's nothing a little bug spray can't solve.
West coast:  you have a great trip, no bugs.  Except on the last day a black bear comes out of nowhere and fucks you in the ass.  Its over in 2 minutes though.
Which trip did you enjoy more?  
When "bad things"(recessions) happen, is frequency and duration more important?  Or intensity?
Lol  I'm not an economist- just looking at things from a different angle.  I would argue the blue diagonal line(market price) is more important than the vertical gray bars(recessions).

Hilarious.  What a bunch of idiots...
@_date: 2016-09-24 21:37:27
What I meant by "minor" was not the length of the recession, but the overall effect on the market.  Yes recessions were longer lasting before the fed, but they had less effect.  Look at the market price swings before and after the Fed.  
Way less price volatility under gold standard.  Longer expansions under the Fed but the market price is all over the place with wild swings up and down.
@_date: 2016-09-18 19:06:19
Yes I agree.  This is the third longest monetary expansion in US history, on it's way to becoming the 2nd largest.  No doubt a recession is coming very soon.
September, October, November are the most dangerous months for financial markets, especially in an election year.  It looks like it's going to be a close race, and markets hate uncertainty.
@_date: 2016-09-24 01:11:53
What's a matter?  +145% in the last 12 months isn't good enough???  You already have the best perfoming asset on earth.

TL;DR 
Taking it very seriously.  Wondering if government will find way to take control of it.  Compares it to other network-based tech throughout history.  Says it may create massive inequality but overall it's pretty positive.

I plan on hodlin till the total value of all my BTC equals 500k+ and the price stays up there for a bit.
I would never "cash out" the whole thing-  I'd just use my bitpay debit card more often.
Once you have 10 years living expenses, your bits should grow in value faster then you can spend them.
I figure Bitcoin should average AT LEAST 10% appreciation most years- even after it mainstreams.
