Trying to shift the debate, bit by bit.
@_date: 2015-06-28 09:49:20
I hope you enjoyed it. 
The reason for not placing the names / titles of the speakers was a style choice I made. I thought it distracts listening to the story and, all the participants are in order of appearance at the end.
Speculating is nice and I appreciate it, but I didn't want to distract specific crowds and I stuck to 'conventional-main-stream' arguments. I personally found it a real challenge throughout the production.

Yes, not considering the 'status' of the speakers is what I had in mind.
@_date: 2015-06-28 14:10:34
First, I'm glad you enjoyed the film.
About the titles/name tags..again, this was a sober decision to not use any.
Animation wise, a few reasons for not using any. Notably, it didn't really work well with the style (I tried). Also, the film was a challenge for me to get it all done by myself and I'm not an animator (also self-funded so not much budget to hire animators). 
Regarding the 'other side', 'the opposition', I think it is represented. Not explicitly by having a US state officer talking about the reasons to blocking Wikileaks, but through talking about the need to maintain social stability and a degree of humanity (and more).    
Many thanks for your feedback. No offense taken once or ever.

thanks, 110101002. I would have to beg to differ (re Andreas's knowledge).
I do agree, however, on not relying on one person/character. The movie is a 2 year project and I've interviewed nearly 100 people by now.
@_date: 2014-12-11 08:22:36
parishiIt0n, can you help me reach RB?
Andreas is great and he's a main character in the overall production.
@_date: 2014-12-10 22:59:26
Thanks, ParsnipCommander. There will be a VO narrative to go along VFX etc.

The subliminal Mpesa (broll) cuts are there to represent the job Safaricom has done in embedding MPesa into the day-to-day rural culture.

A big chunk of my research was in developing countries. I personally believe that Bitcoin is unstoppable if it hits poorer parts of the world (I'm in the UK). I actually spent a couple of week recording a short documentary called Bitcoin In Kenya..happy to discuss that further too :)
@_date: 2014-12-10 22:32:39
The documentary is still 'work-in-progress' and I'm hoping to get some feedback from the r\bitcoin community (if I can call it a community). Over the past nineteen months I had a fare chunk of my viewers clicking through this subreddit and, your opinion counts a lot in my research.
The beautiful animation was created by Proof of Work's Creative Director and co-founder Louis Chang.

From the top of my head I can name Cinema4D and AE.

Thanks randy. The Rise and Rise was done very well, but my focus is a bit different. 
If you follow my work (iamsatoshi.com), you'll notice that I haven't given much, if any attention to bitcoin's price. 
@_date: 2014-12-10 23:15:19
software varies (list is pretty long), but no Flash.

Thanks! The problem I've been having with a speedier delivery (like always), is budget. This project has been self sponsored from day1.
My plan all along was to release it for free on YouTube and I will also seed a torrent (both with a donation address). I think that all I can hope for is donations from viewers (as releasing it for free is very important to me).
@_date: 2014-12-11 00:07:05
thanks for the tip!
There is some great work being done by BitPesa. They have a very strong team and fantastic local developers. 
The meet-up group is also growing. I don't know of much work that is being done, other than that. 
The guys at Tunapanda accept donations in BTC and they do an amazing work with decentralized technologies in East Africa. 
There's also Ian Grigg's Ricardo. 
I haven't heard of any recent updates from Kipochi. 
There's one MPesa agent that wants to do BTC business in Kibera (he has 3 internet cafes/MPesa exchanges), but not much is going on with him (to my knowledge). I do know that he's attending the local meet-ups. 
There is also one very serious entrepreneur, but I'll keep his identity private :)
@_date: 2014-12-11 00:13:27
I agree. 
I was thinking to some how do a crowd-fund of sort, but I don't have a marketing and PR department to make it happen. I'm doing the research, writing, filming, admin and ALL THE REST...
@_date: 2014-12-11 00:49:26
thanks! My personal belief is that if/once Bitcoin gets adopted by the so called 'un-banked', it will seem inhumane to not accept it as the better alternative.

Thanks! 30 Frames per Second?

Thanks! I'll look into that. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 08:19:25
Thanks, rezzme. I appreciate your feedback.
My story will probably seem a bit foreign to people who never heard of Bitcoin. To be more accurate, as Bitcoin is only 1 tool..If you're into Alt finance, hacking, open-source economy, social networks, this film will also be for you. I'm aware of the limits, but it's a decision I had to make. 
Looking forward for more feedback from you! I wonder if you ever watched any of my other videos..maybe you could get a better taste..I understand that it is nearly impossible to tell what the film will be about from this trailer, but maybe try my first trailer...Thanks!!!
I'm going

Thanks! You can see many cuts on my blog/YouTube. I've released more than 100..
@_date: 2014-12-11 08:23:48
Sure, but I do not really know what you mean...
@_date: 2014-12-11 08:11:41
Thanks, jimcc333.
I agree, it dives in quickly. First, you're right, I limited myself to 1 minute.
I think that my film will approach people that are both familiar and not familiar with Bitcoin. I'm taking a personal story approach of someone who learns about Bitcoin for the first time, and goes on a mission to understand it. I think I'm just telling my personal story...Thanks for your comment, I appreciate it.
@_date: 2014-12-11 08:25:02
Yeh, it has that feeling, I agree. Please watch my first trailer, as it feels a bit more trailerish..

This was never released as part of the IamSatoshi project (I thought I would use more of it in Ulterior States), but the time to release it has come..Here's the extended version:

Yes, I will. TBH, someone else started doing it, but I haven't heard from him in a while...
@_date: 2015-07-05 08:34:41
The film is about the reasons bitcoin became popular.
The role of the state, the hegemony of private capital, and, our understanding of money itself [are some points].
These could change the structure of society and the state.

Please translate my film, Ulterior States (or Bitcoin In Kenya).
