short term solution to scaling.
increase the block size, more transactions per block, lower fees
it works, imo it isn't a long term solution

Great post.

i had the same issue, support answered in hours from my ticket and sorted everything.
Chances are a number is off or the originating account causd a flag or its to do with sending the same amount twice.  
You will get your money, they are probably just swamped with support tickets.  Keep updating yours.

If you held btc at the time of the fork you have bch. A fork is just a different chain starting from the forked block, so everything before that block is valid on both chains.

Technically yes. But the risk here is minimal
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:18:10
yes, you would send the coins to your hardware wallet address.
you would then have control of your private keys and wouldn't be subject to any shinnanigans. 
think about paypal; paypal locks accounts all the time making real people unable to access their funds for months.  coinbase can do the same (but doesn't at the level paypal does, they are evil) so moving your money to your own wallet is better. 
It think coinbase is pretty safe compared to other web wallets, but 'whoever owns the private keys owns the coins'

because bitcoin is open source, and anyone can fork it into what they believe it should be.  if others agree, it can have value.
bch was forked because there were enough people who wanted bigger blocks.

because the majority of people in this sub aren't investing, they are speculating.
sane people in will say to put 2-5% of your portfolio in bitcoin.
if your are young, putting 10k of your 100k into a high risk investment like bitcoin isn't a bad thing, but not everyone is in that situation. 
a lot of people tote putting 90%+ into bitcoin (which is fine if your are young and can earn it back).
my recommendation for anyone under 35 with a stable job:
80% etf's (couchpotato style)
20% crypto
want to be risker? go for it.

@_date: 2017-12-15 05:43:07
Yeah, I’m not really surprised though. 
Most people here have never invested, let alone understood global economies, and generally just think “big banks are bad”. 
Sure they have really bad areas, but fractional reserve has its benefits. 
If anything LN solutions of l2+ would improve fractional reserve and force these currencies to have real backing (bitcoin). Ultimately strengthening bitcoin and an economic revolution. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:45:35

If miners move en masse to bch, the difficulty will increase within a few blocks... making it less profitable unless bch increases in price.
We can't say it is working nicely yet.  I don't see how it will work well (if someone with real technical experience with these things can explain, that would be great.  everyone seems to only look at it decreasing difficulty situations)

They wont take your money, but an alternative is to wire the money to Quadrigacx (very good site).  Quad has normally a high spread, so you can eat it or buy eth, send eth to Kraken, convert eth to BTC. (at the time of posting this quad has btc at 8200usd, kraken has 8000usd)

Ask their support.  
I wired for the first time from a business account to t3 and it wasn't showing up.  I asked them whatsup and they said they can see the wire but it is not allowed because I wasn't t4.
I sent in the t4 paperwork and had the wire in my account within a day.
Kraken support has been really good for me. I'm also canadian. Unfortunately their site has a 99.9% downtime.
They won't steal your money even if the accounts don't match.

You can buy with the middle box where you enter CAD and click buy bitcoin. This is market price.
You can also click on the Trade tab and buy bitcoin at a limit price. 
Sometimes the CAD price on Quadriga is super inflated because there isn't enough volume.  This isn't really bad, maybe ~$200CAD more per coin at most, but if you are actively trading you should wait till the spread is lower.
I wait until the difference between BTC in USD (converted to CAD) and Quadriga CAD are close.  You don't have to do this.
Right now the price in CAD on quadriga is 8400 and the price on bitfinex in USD converted to CAD is 8269 so it costs $131 more. Kraken CAD is 8448 so this isn't a `bad` deal on quadriga.

@_date: 2017-11-14 00:11:43
IMO it will lead to stabilization in mining - which leads to miners having to choose based on opinion.  I think the increase in price needed for BCH to be more profitable to mine is too high, but it is a possibility. 
I don't think miners can abuse this like they have the EDA since switching would have to be done too fast, but if there is enough hashpower doing it who knows.  I would think missed blocks during the switch over these shorter periods would lead to less profit.
I guess the wildcard is whales manipulating BCH (buying) and BTC (large sell walls putting downward pressure on price.
This is all IMO, I have no idea what is going to happen and hold both 50/50 based on coins.

s9 is your best option.  But remember those calculators are based on now so if difficulty goes up (it for sure will) and price doesn't you will make less.
All in all, if you can get an s9 right now its not a bad thing to do if your electricity is around .08usd kwh.  Ordering from there site will get you 2 for under 4k in january sometime.

Quadriga if you want to buy in CDN
Kraken if you want to buy in USD
Kraken's site is slow as shit when more than 2.5 people use it, otherwise it has been good to me (I won't use it for active trading until they fix it).
With quadriga be sure to watch the price and buy it when the volume is high so the spread isn't so high (take the bitfinex usd price and convert to CAD and wait till they are as close as you are comfortable with).

a little more insight into this; it started off being 'innocent' adware.  Adware (bundled exe's that inject ads but allow you to delete the binary) was relatively clean, if annoying, but quickly lost profitability due to some really shady outfits pushing the envelope.
All of the 'clean' adware companies were pushed out of the market by 'shady' maleware/adware mixes that did not allow you to delete and auto deleted other bundled adware.
Once more ad networks and affiliate programs cracked down on the 'shady' bundlers, we started to get more real malware bundled on sites like sourceforge (it had been happening on torrent/warez sites for much longer, but they never had morals). It's not just sourceforge, almost every file directory site does it.
The malware started out being regular run of the mill stuff creating botnet miners, phishing and whatnot but with the run up of bitcoins popularity and price more of them moved to attacks like this.
I was in the industry back in the day, and it's crazy how much of shitshow it has turned into.  We went from bundled search engines and toolbars to malware in a span of 3-4 years.
We still see legit apps being bundled with 'clean' monetization, but it is usually only direct downloads (think vlc, ftp clients etc).
