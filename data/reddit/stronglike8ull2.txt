Keep up the HODL. You only really need to sell if the price dips below 9k, but even you can hope the market recovers and not sell

What he said 
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:18:12
I honestly don’t see why. Give me like a specific example besides saying it shouldn’t be with a non spouse because just saying it’s going to be bad is not going to be enough to deter me unless I have a better reason of what could go wrong. 
My friend and I are about as close as it gets we both trust each other with our lives. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:31:22
Ah I see. I’m not sure to be honest with you because I’ve done the same thing. I wouldn’t worry too much because the value of whatever you bought in at will likely be a few thousand higher in the next day. 
My theory is that the price is changing so much right now that it doesn’t have time to catch up and show an accurate number when people buy
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:45:39
Of course it COULD turn into a nice gain over the next few years, just remember two rules 
1. You never know what’s going to happen with the price of bitcoin
2. Only invest what you’re willing to lose
If history repeats then then based on my research the price will eventually drop a significant amount, but it’ll also recover and go higher than it was before

Plain and simple, he doesn’t have as much time as I do to monitor bitcoin investments, but he still wants to invest. Neither of us are pulling out until we decide to sell everything, so my strategy of dividing any profits up based on % of the total investment should be fine.

I actually just checked my online banking and funds are being pulled. I still haven’t received any of my bitcoins, however. Should I be worried about that?
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:28:20
Yeah I made that comment right after I woke up and was pretty groggy. I’m using an online wallet
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:16:33
Makes sense with the fees. I didn’t think about that 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:19:26
That’s what I’m seeing too. Probably just gonna hodl
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:19:13
Nono I don’t think you understand. I’m asking if I should worry about the bank denying my bitcoin purchase
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:24:35
The price is rising at an astronomical rate. As of this comment the price is about to surge past $16k
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:08:01
Can you explain? I’m genuinely curious why you say that 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:20:27
Technically the transaction hasn’t gone through yet. It’s still pending on Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:59:04
Based on what’s been happening all day leading up to now $16k appears to be the corrected price despite all the ups and downs today 
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:47:41
How much/why?
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:22:17
Yeah same thing. If you buy at this very moment you’re buying for $14,390 (or whatever the price is now) and it’s locked. In fact, whatever place you’re buying from should tell you this when buy and sell.

This was what I was trying to say earlier, but I couldn’t find the right way to say it and people didn’t understand what I was trying to say(see the top comment) I don’t know why people got the idea that my friend would know every facet of my banking information. The plan was going to be something like this 
I invest on my own obviously. 
My friend gives me cash for his investment and I take it to my bank to deposit and later on buy his bitcoin 
And if he ever wanted to dip on me I would just give him his original investment + profit in cash. I don’t know what’s so hard to understand about that, but I digress.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:51:38
Understandable. My bad man
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:12:21
Invest it back into bitcoin. In my head this seemed like a good idea 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:44:19
I never asked about the price that I bought in at. You didn’t read my post. I’ve just heard that some banks will deny people when they see people buying bitcoin for a lot of money which would obviously suck and was trying to ask about that 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:14:51
Yes I would buy back in on the dip. I’m just trying to see what everyone thinks 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:28:14
Whatever the price of bitcoin was when you bought in is what you’re paying for even if the price goes up. Think of it as when you hit the buy button you “lock in” at that price 
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:39:19
It’s a life long friend of mine. We’re both investing into one account that I’m running and whenever we decide to sell, the money we get will be divided based on how much of a % we contributed to the overall investment. Initially we’re both putting in $50 so the total will be $100 which would mean if we cash out next week and get $150 we would both get $25. I’m sticking to adding $50 every two weeks and from the way it sounds my friend will be adding more money more frequently. I’ll be keeping a strict log of how much money is added (unless Coinbase does that already? I wouldn’t know because I haven’t actually been able to use it yet)
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:11:21
If you sell now it sells for whatever a bitcoin is worth at this moment. It just takes a while for the transaction to happen 
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:52:27
What do you mean?
