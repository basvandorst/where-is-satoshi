If you want an idea of what pure free market looks like, be my guest and move to Mexico.  The laws there are disregarded and you WILL pay at least one cartel for "protection".  
The free market is a fantastic ideal but it can be gamed which is why we need constantly evolving regulation.

I understand this system but must continue to respectfully disagree. This is actually how fire protection used to work.  We switched for a reason, because corporations are set up to above all else to earn profits.  It is good to have government services that can operate at net zero or even a loss.  They are there to protect and serve, not earn a profit.

Have fun dealing with Koch Brothers Police, Inc.  
If police systems were private everything would be illegal.  There is a strong correlation between the privatizing of  jails and the war on drugs. 
Pure capitalism is just as bad as pure communism.

While I totally agree competition is great for innovation it is not a great model to protect your rights.  I personally believe I and everyone else has a right to safety, and it should not be a for profit system.

Why all the hate?  Coinbase stated their policy with more than enough time to move your coins earlier this month.  If you waited until now to move your coins it is your own fault.
Edit:  while Bitcoin cash is new, it has been WELL known that you a) should never keep bitcoin on an exchange long term and b) we knew no matter what that August 1 would be contentious and c) that the network can face congestion at times, so there is literally no excuse for having money on an exchange this close to the potential forks.
