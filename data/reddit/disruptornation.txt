Just received an email saying I needed to confirm a transaction for .383 BTC. Saw the URL was blokchaln . info and stopped it right away. It's summer time. Let the phishing begin.

Now that's funny.

If you're interested in an auto cosigner for a 2 - 3 wallet that only cosigns based on personalized policies, then check out  You might find it useful.

We built an automated cosigner that works with Copay. Would love to have you give it a try and provide some feedback.

The assumption is that a user knows which policies are in place and will therefore elect to initiate a transaction and then manually approve those that don't meet the policies. The "Manually Approve Transaction" policy cannot be removed at this point, but we're open to discussing a change based on user feedback. Please submit the feedback on the website so other users can vote it up. I will also discuss this point with our development team.

We just launched our automated cosigner service that's integrated with Copay. Makes transacting with bitcoin simple and secure. sig3.io

I'm a big fan of Copay and would suggest checking it out if you haven't yet. Beyond Copay we'll working on integrating with Electrum and Coinkite as the next step.

I appreciate the article Bitcoin Magazine. sig3.io

Do we know if they're including multisig in their updates?
@_date: 2015-10-28 15:08:34
I switched from blockchain.info to Copay. Copay is a super simple wallet to use and I've never had issues.

That could work but its clunky. If you setup a 2 of 3 wallet, then you could use Sig3.io as an automated cosigner based on policies you choose. For example, you could choose to have Sig3 automatically cosign for any transaction below $50. If the transaction is larger, then you could cosign it yourself with your third key and bypass Sig3. Let me know your feedback if you decide to try it out. We've received positive responses so far.

We're working on an integration with Coinkite right now. The Sig3 product currently works with the Copay wallet as an automated cosigner based on user directed policies. Sounds like we could be an option soon, but not yet. sig3.io

The issue with multisig is that it's not convenient. At sig3.io we've integrated with Copay and are actively working to integrate with Coinkite and Electrum. We'll also be releasing an API shortly. Sig3 is a policy based automated cosigner so you get the security of multisig and the convenience of a single key wallet. Try it out and let us know how works for you.

Makes sense. We have the code done to create a paper wallet with Copay so you could back up the third key, but we haven't deployed it. 
@_date: 2015-10-19 21:12:27
I really liked your explanation of multisig on 99bitcoins. I also agree that Copay is probably the most simple multisig wallet available, which is why we decided to integrate with Copay first. Would love to talk to you about Sig3.io, our automated cosigner.
@_date: 2015-10-28 15:10:41
You can also use Sig3.io as an automated cosigner for your Copay wallet. Soon you'll be able to use Sig3 with Coinkite and Electrum as well.

If you like Copay and the 2 of 3 methods of BitGo and Coinbase, then you should try using Copay with Sig3 as the automated cosigner. You can set your cosigning policies within Sig3. It only makes sense to use a 3rd party service to do the cosigning so there is no single point of failure. sig3.io

If you like Copay, then you should try Sig3.io as an automated cosigner. It makes multisig transactions simple.
