I found this wonderful service that allows to order yourself either VIRTUAL (1$ issuing fee) or Real Plastic Mastercard (4.99$ issuing fee)
Money Depositing from variety of internet services ( Yandex Money, Paxum, Swift Wire, Sepa, OKPay, Payeer with comissions)  and **BITCOIN** with 0% comission! Takes 1 hour to load the money with BTC. Decent exchange rate.
Best thing on their site is that they are offering cards without ID verification ( Upto 500$ daily. 2500$ monthly limits apply without verification)
Verification is easy and painless, took only 30 minutes for me.
Their registered location is Gibraaltar.
The service and customer support is good and replies are fast.
Will try to answer your questions here. But i'm not affiliated with the company
**Their fees for physical mastercard. Just send coins to it and it will be converted at coinbase rate.**

The exchange fee is decent. On par with major exchanges.
There are fees when you are paying in other currencies/withdrawing.

Its targeting the russian market because the service is highly required by russian webmasters.
Also considering the time it takes to fund a card its quite easy to keep only minimum there. 
Cards are issued in US$ and exchange rate if you pay in another currency is 2% off mastercard exchange rate, which aint free but is decent...
