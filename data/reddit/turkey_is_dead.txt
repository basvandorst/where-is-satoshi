aint nobody going to pay $20-50 to open a payment channel and then put a deposit in there, that's just crazy talk. They need to make this foolproof for the dummies if they want this to work. Like one button that says "Pay Now." Anything beyond that then the devs are fucking up big time.

Do you know me. Don’t assume anything in life.  I hold many coins and read many things not just about btc. I read literature history science keep up to date in current affairs have many friends in asia including china. Have plenty of sources of information about crypto beyond what you are so ignorantly assuming. If you choose to support a nefarious project to sully and muddy this project that’s your perogative but I wouldn’t assume you are ignorant so don’t assume that about others who hold a different world view on things. It makes you look naive and manipulated. Good luck my friend. I have had enough but you may need it.

Right. Just as the market dictates coinbase is corrupt and makes sure everyone knows it. This is unfolding as it should in a free market space.

I am someone poor who btc has gotten out of debt, so I don't know where you are getting your information from.
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:30:15
Xrb is working. Iota needs to scale up. I have btc for value storage but newer tech will supersede it for value transfer. Writing is on the wall. People too lazy to keep up to date to what is going on will be caught with their pants down. Good luck.

He was constantly being accused of insider trading with litecoin, so he dumped it all so he can develop it with transparency and a clear conscience.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:56:53
What are you talking about? S korea is worried about youth trading, scam companies selling btc to old folks and disappearing and chinese money laundering. N korea is not even in the conversation. I live in korea and have been following the news. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:32:09
Why is btc so slow and expensive? I hold some but worst to use out of my coins. I not not hold any bitcoin cash.  
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:16:28
What? You show vulnerabilities to the devs and help to patch them. You sound really sure about your opinions. Here’s your chance to put your money where your mouth is and get 20 btc. Good luck.

Google is a good search engine. Good luck  
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:41:26
Yes. You are new to trading so I recommend you find a way to practice before using real money. First, nobody knows when the peak is, so you don't know when to sell. And nobody knows when the dip ends so you don't know when to buy. Lets say you bought at 10 and sold at 12 but it continued to go up to 25 when do you think you will buy back in. Most people have a hard time buying back in after their sell price and will miss most of those profits. Also, when it reaches 25 it might only dip back to 22 so you have psyched yourself off from ever entering the market again. Now just imagine the opposite of this as it lowers in price. Even if you have years of experience of trading with great TA analytical skills btc acts differently then other commodities and is very volatile. Good luck and keep asking questions.

Can we stop using this sub to attack him and just focus on what we can do to help btc grow and get better.

Thanks for writing this. They can’t get away with stealing money.

honestly speed and cost is important. Decentralization as an idea is probably most important but for the masses they want it cheap and fast. Maybe btc should have a smaller market cap and userbase which sucks but maybe that's reality.
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:53:56
There are also many altcoins with amazing tech some of which is already being used. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:26:55
I traded during the Internet bubble. It has nothing to do with crypto adoption. You are talking about small companies that no had no real plan for getting quarterly earnings to justify their evaluations. Listed companies are under enormous pressure to show quarterly growth and profits. Those .com companies had no chance in that time period. Cryptocurrency is not under any pressure like that. It just needs adoption and it is happening exponentially. You are confusing a form of currency/store of value and what a company is.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:31:42
When the dust settles there will be plenty of vibrant ecosystems for altcoins. Just a question of which few survive with btc.

Just collusion between coinbase roger ver china jihan to spam btc network steal btc brand and bring chaos and make whole market look terrible. No big deal at all 
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:03:38
It's the transaction time and fees. We just have to hope they improve sooner than later.
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:50:39
Xrb is free and very fast. I suggest you try it. I have btc as a store of value but dag coins will be used as transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:57:33
It’s not false. Koreans in forums are turning on btc because it takes longer for korean exchanges to process btc and then the fees are higher. Koreans don’t care about decentralization, they just want speed and it to be cheap. Bums me out to no end!
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:00:54
there will still be banks/lenders. Transaction will be transparent though through blockchain tech instead of wondering how a bank is speculating with my mortgage.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:51:10
It was very useful to me. Most useful tech i have ever used and continue to use to make the quality of my life better. Again you are being misled by biased information. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:52:29
They have 10,000 xrb bounty for you to prove your case. Good luck.

Unfortunately it is working because bch is catching up. They will continue doing this until bch passes btc.

You keep doing you. Good luck.

They are mostly regulating exchanges in korea that were preying on senior citizens and young students. Also a lot of chinese were coming to seoul to cash out and take yuan back to china which is a fiat laundering issue via btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:46:59
People don’t want to deal with this confusing stuff. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:50:01
They are trying to separate crypto exchanges from any indication that it is a financial commodity. In the end, these exchanges are becoming so big they won't need the banks anymore and will probably hold their customers' deposits as the government moves in to regulate them, so the customers can trust that they will be able to convert back to fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:43:17
It's called being a community and taking care of each other. Yes there needs to be parameters but the young, old and defenseless sometimes need extra care and it's up to us, the young, the strong and wealthy to look out for the more unfortunate ones. The only thing that makes our diversion from the patterns of nature worthwhile is our greater capacity for empathy and love. Not science, not weapons of mass destruction, not distillation of nature into numbers but that we can find the good in the things that are common to us as well as the things that are different.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:21:42
You should be ashamed of yourself.

Also Korean exchange does have fees. Bithumb just sells coupons for heavy traders for feeless trades once they reach a certain volume.
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:48:24
Well bithumb is one of the problems in South Korean crypto market. They are preying on senior citizens using pump and dump tactics to steal their savings and also orchestrating massive pumps with server outtages causing huge customer service complaints that is being covered extensively in Korean press causing bitcoin to look terrible and like a scam.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:46:23
Is it possible that the us govt can suddenly ban cryptocurrency exchanges? Or is there a legal or constitutional defense that would impede them for this kind of draconian regulation?
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:17:03
What does that have to do with the us govt banning the dollar to converting to cryptocurrencies? This would wreck the crypto market no?
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:43:30
Also South Korean government announces meeting between China and Japan to discuss how to regulate cryptocurrency market. Right now cryptocurrency trading volume is outpacing KOSDAQ and about half the volume of KOSPI.
