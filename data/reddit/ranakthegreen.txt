Did I miss something? Cause I just saw bitcoin at 11k, and compared to like, October of last year, that still double value at least right?

If anything, this is the time to cash out, wait for the crash, and get back in the game.

The ZWD dollar does indeed fluctuation an absolute insane amount in a short amount of time. Inflation reached 5 billion percent before it was scrapped in 2009. Zimbabwe does not have a national currency anymore, and it de facto uses USD.

This actually doesn't help gain favor with other governments... Malta is a tax-haven and they piss off a lot of governments.

"Better than the alternative, which has governments cooperating in the plunder."

Tax haven is another way of saying that it steals from *other countries* to give money to corporations while still "plundering" (read: Taxing citizens for services the government provides) its own citizens.

Lets be careful about calling WaPo fake news, some people might believe it.

Like maybe around 2-3 percent?

I don't know... being able to control the money supply is one of the most powerful and influential things a government can do for its currency. Without it the stability of a country would be much much worse.

Uhh... I like inflation though, it makes my debt cheaper so that it becomes easier to pay off compared to if the currency was deflating.

Fun fact: The Fed is not the government. They are a completely separate organization. So... how's the fairytale?
