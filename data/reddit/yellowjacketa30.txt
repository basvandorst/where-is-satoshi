Could you suggest a plausible alternative conclusion?
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:33:24
Yeh, because people who were buying bitcoin at under a penny are hanging out on Reddit trying to make bets with strangers :-D
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:41:53
Starbucks Gold?
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:16:32
No, you just drop obvious hints like you bought into bitcoin at under a dollar. That is a transparent brag about wealth. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:11:10
Crypto, rough, yeh, whatever. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:36:56
Thanks for sharing your work. Could this be adapted to OpenLibre Calc format? I don't like using Google/Cloud solutions. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 23:56:07
Yeh, Ethereum a shit coin bro. Ethereum will fail at what it is doing. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:45:09
Neither have I, but I use it and it would be a great security improvement over Google's cloud. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:27:23
Oh yeh, new all time highs take forever in the crypto world. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:25:32
You can Google the future now? Wow!
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:26:25
Oh, good response. I take it back. You are an excentric crypto zillionaire. 
Try using your big words instead of pictures. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:01:26
Yeh and Starbucks 2X never happened. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:20:49
Or 1 year longer. Service fiat debt with crypto if you have to, but don't pay it off early is my advice. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 23:53:41
Any bank that will make a sandwich from chicken breasts instead of bread deserves the initial KYC in my book. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 08:25:11
Ahhh, from this well worded post...
To this curt shutdown...
"Topic Closed" Really? 
@_date: 2017-03-06 21:45:00
Ideally country but could be server.
@_date: 2017-03-06 15:16:19
Yeh, looks like I need to do it myself. Thanks for the list. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 23:49:05
Are there any bips out there to add community decision making with blockchain based voting similar to coins like Decred?
@_date: 2017-01-24 00:05:19
*cough* Bitsquare *cough*
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:44:19
Love the idea and will probably buy one. One observation, maybe consider the dissimilar metals problem with stainless steel and aluminum when it comes to the case screws?
@_date: 2016-11-19 21:31:53
Using a VPN and bitcoin over TOR would solve that concern but what's the alternative? I'd do it on a creditcard, it's an important cause, too important. 
@_date: 2016-11-07 18:31:29
Why waste my time copy and pating an address for an outcone that won't be happening. Sorry for your inevitable bad week. 
@_date: 2016-11-07 20:53:44
I can't sign up as a driver as the phone number verification number text never arrives :-(
Also, not really decentralized, but as an owner of an older car not qualified for uber or lyft, I'd love to see it take off.
@_date: 2016-11-04 16:38:48
Yeh, which is a real bummer as a decentralized bitcoin powered uber app would be super useful and now I know it's not seriously being worked on, I'm a sad panda.
@_date: 2016-11-04 16:33:05
It's worth watching just for the real time visual representation of the Bitcoin network at the end. It's hypnotic video. I like the rest too.
@_date: 2016-11-01 17:33:51
Thanks! This post isn't showing up when searching baltimore in the /bitcoin search box. Does it take a while to index?
@_date: 2016-11-10 19:53:03
As an owner of an older car that doesn't qualify for uber or lift, I'm setup as a driver but without some marketing, don't know how it gets to critical mass though.
Still waiting on a truly decentralized app with integrated bitcoin though. I'd donate some promotion time to that!
@_date: 2016-11-09 18:26:35
Mycelium on Android over Tor via Orbit works great to keep your cell provider and others from knowing what you are doing. 
@_date: 2016-11-28 02:06:46
Forget mixing.
Exchange -&gt; bitcoin wallet
bitcoin -&gt; cryptoexchange1 (e.g. polinex)
bitcoin -&gt; cryptoexchange1 -&gt; monero cryptocurrency
monero -&gt; monero wallet (mywallet)
monero -&gt; cryptoexchange2 (e.g. shapeshift) -&gt; bitcoin
bitcoin -&gt; bitcoin wallet
Fungability for the digital cash win! 
@_date: 2016-11-08 03:04:05
You have to add a +1 before the area code. If the keyboard doesn't have a + just type it somewhere else on your phone and copy/paste it into that field. Worked for me. Hope that helps. I have an older car too :-)
@_date: 2016-11-09 22:02:19
Android + Mycelium + Tor via Orbit + VPN + Trezor for the ultimate win :-D
@_date: 2018-02-04 04:24:54
Umm, message winner a unique address at auction end?
@_date: 2018-02-04 05:03:42
Why hasn't someone built a purse.io for ebay yet? Seems an obvious move with manageable technical issues. eBay bots already exist.
@_date: 2016-10-24 01:49:17
Not impossible but inheritance is the most common cause of being rich. Upward mobility through work is much less likely than most think. 
@_date: 2016-10-18 19:00:37
+1 Trezor
@_date: 2016-10-25 03:25:22
Yeh, I'm staring at the same issue after spending all my time going through all the other steps. Waste of time. They need to be upfront before wasting everyone's time. 
@_date: 2016-10-24 02:07:22
Yeh, run don't walk away from the shitcoin to beat all shitcoins. 
@_date: 2016-10-05 01:02:24
Trezor +1 Love mine. 
@_date: 2016-10-24 05:58:54
I suspect it may have been a Tmobile issue in that case. 
@_date: 2016-10-22 14:46:13
Yes. Buy on the rumors, hodl on the news :-)
@_date: 2017-06-19 00:59:02
Why not your dudeness? 
@_date: 2017-06-19 00:57:49
I hate that shit. Downvoting. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 21:48:07
You're not storing your bitcoin on that exchange you mentioned right?
@_date: 2017-06-19 01:38:11
It's OK, just don't put more into cash money than you are willing to lose :-)
