 You may need to inform Intel of this.

im looking for what are the dangers of bigger blocks and articles to support that discussion.

First: Nielsen's Law: Users' bandwidth grows by 50% per year (10% less than Moore's Law for computer speed). So latency is not an issue. Dont know if you were aware of this. 
Second: I can only find speculation of "bigger block centralization" and no evidence that it happens or ever happened. This is my concern that speculation may *not* be correct. Actually the centralization that no one discusses is developer centralization. Core has been in absolute control of BTC for so long but no mention of this and how this may be harmful. The fact that BTC dominance is dropping, adoption is decreasing, and price action has stalled may imply that the centralization of developers may be killing bitcoin.

How about developer centralization with Core.

That site shows "block size" increased over time and then stopped.   
"limit was effectively around 500-750k in serialized bytes, and was forgotten until 2013 March." that is wikipedia showing 500 to 740k increase in block size and then 1MB

1) Im actually a biologist so I like to see the literature for reasoning and only thing I found is article by Cornell that states BTC can be increased up to 4 MB safely. I cant find anything on the limit of the block size or why. That is what I am looking for to have empirical evidence on why there is a limitation at 1 MB. 
2) I have some Bcash from the fork and used it for the first time today and it was fast.  My friend told me the miners are the same for BTC and that got me confused because bcash is working ok and I said that is not possible because higher blocks would crash the network. Can you recommend some articles for me on block sizes so I can read more on this? Thank you
