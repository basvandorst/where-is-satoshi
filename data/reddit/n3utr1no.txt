Full bitcoin node would be difficult to get for free because of the storage limitations.
Tor node/freenet sounds interesting I'll take a look at it.

Oh yes. This is a good addition

The way I understood the situation is that Greece should sell its assets to the private sector not to the EU.
It is in no way a better solution but the money for that is not created by the EZB as you imply.

Nice work. Will map Kyoto today. :-)
One little nitpick, after closing the app. The location service stays subscribed I had to force close to release it. It would drain my precious battery otherwise.
As a fellow android developer I say: managing the location service is a bitch. :-) 
Keep up the good work!

I just donated some coins. Sitting at the beach in Koh Lanta, Thailand. Bitcoin is truly awesome.

I would use it for mini transactions, it is comparable with cash in your back pocket.
But I agree. The end user pc is hostile territory.
You have to assume an average end user's computer is under control of a 3rd party.
It can be made secure, but it requires some effort beyond installing Microsoft's antivirus tools.
I wouldn't recommend this to any of my not so pc savy friends.
If someone makes a secure live cd with this. Or even a device.

I agree. Thats what I am working at right now. Should be finished by monday.
Thanks for the feedback

Well this thread is quite old. But I released an android app that uses the coinmap data. If anyone still interested

Sure better safe than sorry. :-)

Not if you properly implement two factor authentication. 
You do the transaction on your PC. And you need to confirm with a message you get on your mobile. Containing the amount and the first 5 digits of the address you are paying to and a code.
Confirm by entering the code in your browser if the amount and the recipient match.
Even if your host is a cesspool of malware you are safe.

there is one permission that might bother you
    android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
but it is needed to cache the tiles.
