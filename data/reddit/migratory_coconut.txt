Either I'm missing something clever about your comment, or you don't know how mining works.
Just in case it's the latter, I'll explain: miners use their computers to solve math problems for the network. They join pools to get a steady income. The pools direct their work by partitioning out the problems. Miners can "point their hashing power elsewhere" by disconnecting from the pool and connecting to a different one.

First, I don't actually believe that hoarding is a big problem. I'm just saying that that's the oft-cited argument against deflation. Second, you're setting up a straw man there. No one is arguing that people would starve themselves to hold onto their money during deflation. The argument is that with inflation, you need to invest all your money to beat inflation. Money that you don't invest declines in value. With deflation, you might invest less because there's a zero-risk option that slowly gains value. This stimulates the economy less than investing all of it. Of course, you might still invest all your savings, but there's less incentive so less people will and they'll take less risky investments.
In summary: Deflation results in less incentive to invest money in others. This isn't a deal breaker, but it is a real downside. The only real upside to a deflationary currency is that it prevents extreme inflation. This might be worth it.

While I don't generally compare bitcoin to the internet, it does have some objective benefits over current online transaction technology. What we have now works, but bitcoin does it better. The current banking system relies on a number of rather inefficient accounting systems. The system here in developed countries is pretty polished, to the point that it only manifests in delays. Slow wire transfers, holds on some of your money in your checking account for about a day after you add a large amount of money, stuff like that. It is more apparent in developing countries where new bank infrastructure is very slow to develop and there are many points of failure. It's a simple fact that money can be lost or delayed in the current system. Bitcoin solves all that while also allowing for individuals to hold their own money and send it to any other entity easily and quickly. Bitcoins are never lost and almost never delayed.
The point of all of the above is that bitcoin is an improvement. The question at hand is not if it's better, but instead if it's worth the cost of adoption.
Finally, your name is slightly offensive. I recommend that you change it if you don't want some people to assume you are a troll.
@_date: 2014-01-21 22:38:40
Ah, so you think that the need to actually acquire bitcoin instead of simply inflate the money supply would be enough to prevent bailouts. That's a tough question. I think that the bailout would probably still happen, but it's debatable.
This raises the question: should governments be able to print money? Many here think no, and I usually agree. Yet some times being able to magic up more money can be useful as a last ditch effort to prevent the government from becoming bankrupt. It's fearsome to consider a system in which the US could be out of money and have no way to get more except from some kind of emergency appropriations.

I imagine that it's simple a matter of more mainstream media getting to the top, and we know that mainstream media has a more negative view of bitcoin.
Google has a thing called "pagerank". It's the basic way they evaluate a websites value before they apply things like search personalisation. Pagerank is based on the number of links that the Google spider is able to find to that page. So mainstream news sites sites have a high pagerank because more people link to them. Likewise, bitcoin-specific news sites (which have a much better opinion of bitcoin) have less viewers, less links to them, and worse pagerank. That's why they end up further down the page.
In other words, I think the phenomenon you're observing is a natural result of Google's algorithm, and I don't think they've applied any special rules for the purpose of hurting bitcoin.

It's a bit unfair to say that sensationalism and journalistic manipulation is new. It goes back hundreds of years. Look at the preserved newspapers from the 1800s. With a little bit of sensitivity to context it's easy to see how writers back then were spinning stories just as bad as this one so they could sell more papers. I would argue that these "respected" papers were never as pristine as their esteemed names imply.

Lots of economists believe deflation is bad, and that 2-3% inflation is ideal. However, that's not a good reason to ban bitcoin. For one thing, the economics of a deflationary system have never been fully explored because no large scale, permanently deflationary state has ever existed. For another, you don't ban something because it encourages a nonideal economic system.
Honestly, I believe that deflation isn't as good as minor inflation, but I don't think it'll kill bitcoin or that it would kill America if bitcoin were to gain traction. The only upside to deflation that I see on a macroeconomic scale is that we don't have to worry about runaway inflation as much.

On the other hand, sites do have an incentive to cut out Verotel. I'm sure they charge an appreciable percentage. You have to admit that consumer -&gt; bitpay -&gt; verotell -&gt; site is an absurdly long payment chain.
Also, I'm a little worried about bitpay's monopoly on accepting bitcoin. On one hand they bring businesses into the bitcoin economy, on the other hand they insulate everyone but the bitcoin users from the actual bitcoins. I feel like bitpay might just become a wrapping around bitcoin and businesses will never learn to accept bitcoin directly. That would neutralise a lot of the saving from using bitcoin in the first place.

Not impossible to use in a fractional reserve banking system. In fact, it can be done just the same as with fiat. Receive funds to hold from savers. Keep a fraction for day to day withdrawals, loan out a fraction. Pay small levels of interest from the profits from loans.

Better: Bitcoin links. Just like a magnet link opens your torrent client, you can set your browser to associate certain custom link types with certain programs on your computer. When you install a bitcoin client it will give you the option of setting up link association in your browser. Then Amazon can code links that send what amount and address to send to. You log in, find what you want, and click the "Bitcoin" button, right below the "one-click" button. It's a bitcoin link. Your client pops up with a window showing the transaction. You click ok and the money is sent. Amazon waits for a few confirmations and then confirms your purchase. It's two clicks instead of one, but I doubt anyone cares.

That won't happen. If Bitcoin grows big enough to harm them, and they fail to destroy it, they can just assimilate it. Start doing their shenanigans with bitcoins instead of dollars. They can still buy and sell stocks, offer loans, etc with bitcoin and contracts. All bitcoin does is allow you to keep your money out of their hands while you're not doing those things with them.

The point about it not being intrinsically bad is that the false illusion of extra money is not intrinsic to the system. That is, it is possible to practice fractional reserve banking without creating this problem. The problem is that it can and often does, because there's profit in risky activity.

Meh. You can loan someone money with dollars too. It's nothing special about bitcoin. With bitcoin you'll still have to have banks for your day to day loans, otherwise whenever you need a loan you have to go convince a friend who has money to spare. Not everyone has friends who are rich enough to loan them money for a house, so you'll still have banks for that sort of thing. Bitcoin doesn't change that.

Kind of conspiracy theory-ish, but I've seen crazier things go down. I think it's a possibility, but the evidence isn't there. If it turns out to be true, at least the bitcoins aren't lost. That's better than nothing.
@_date: 2014-01-21 20:28:50
There would still be problems if they fail. Consider the following example of a BTC fractional reserve failing: The bank takes money from account holders to give out loans, as usual. The bank makes the bad decision of giving out too many risky loans, just like the recent housing crisis. The bank is overconfident and gives out a lot of these loans, keeping only a small portion for customer withdrawals. The people holding those loans default. The bank is now massively in the red, it only has the portion that it kept for day to day business. The public finds out it's close to going under, so they try to get their money out. A bank run ensues. The bank does not have all the money for everyone's accounts, so lots of account holders get shafted.
We've seen how a BTC denominated bank can fail painfully. Now, why not bail it out? Imagine the government has a lot of BTC. It could choose to let them fail, or it could bail them out by giving them the BTC required to pay all their customers.
Fractional reserve banking works exactly the same in BTC as with dollars. I don't know how this myth got started, but BTC really won't bring a revolution in banking except for possibly replacing checking accounts.
@_date: 2014-02-08 17:48:57
This is a serious problem. The biggest problem bitcoin faces is ASICs causing centralised mining. Bitcoin is meant to be decentralised, we need lots of individuals or at least multiple pools mining. Otherwise we become vulnerable to a 51% attack.

You made an incorrect statement. Hands-down incorrect. The 51% attack is an unfortunate byproduct of the protocol, not a device that was included as some twisted "democracy" of miners. The protocol was certainly not designed to allow the miners to redistribute wealth as they please. Bitcoin was designed as an impartial, immutable system and these aspects are simply flaws.

I don't see a meaningful distinction between tokens and money. Money is tokens.
I see your point though. The value of bitcoin for international transfers is mitigated by the fact that ways to use bitcoin are limited. Of course, there are few ways to spend yen here in the US as well. If you have yen here in the united states it becomes one of the tokens you mentioned, useful only for buying dollars. For this reason I think bitcoin is similar to a foreign currency.
Edit: If you don't see it as a transfer of currency, can you still see it as a transfer of wealth? Because that's what people actually care about.

Yes, I have sent and received bitcoins. You misunderstand the process of the transaction.

For the purposes of business transactions, neither party can consider the coins safely transfered until there are several confirmations.

The reason we would need banks, or rather, the reason that banks always arise, is that it makes it easier to find people to give you a loan. Without banks you would have to find friends or one-man banks to give you loans. Where else would you get a loan for your house?

Agreed. Remember, we've had multiple bubbles in the past. Experience tells us that there should be a few months of slow rise before the next big bubble. I believe this is psychologically driven: even with good indications, people need a while to recharge before jumping on a bubble.

@_date: 2014-02-14 05:59:27
There is no flaw in the protocol per se. This is instead a problem with the implementation of the software. Look up Transaction ID Malleability for technical details. It has a few symptoms. For normal clients, like the one on your computer, the only error you'll see is that after sending a transaction your balance sometimes doesn't seem to go down. This is just an illusion. If you try to spend these illusory coins, your transaction will fail. The illusion goes away once your initial transaction has enough confirmations.
This isn't a very big problem. I didn't even notice. The bigger problem was at Mt Gox. Their custom (read: shitty) software didn't handle this very well, and kept failing some of the transactions used in customer withdrawals because it tried to send illusionary coins. This prompted Mt Gox to freeze withdrawals until they figured out their software. This prompted a shitstorm.
IMO, this isn't the biggest technical problem bitcoin has faced. I think the split in the blockchain sometime last year was more serious. I remember everyone acting like the sky was falling. But then they fixed it and everyone calmed down overnight. I imagine the same thing will happen within a week, a fortnight at most.
@_date: 2014-01-19 16:48:50
You forget that we have documents. The development of bitcoin has always been an open group effort. Read the white paper. No mention of designing in the 51% attack. Read the first documented concerns about the 51% attack. They're worried about it, not happy.
This is really an issue of historical fact. While there's a vanishingly small possibility that satoshi or someone was secretly in favor do these flaws, the evidence suggests otherwise.
Finally, I would like to remind you once again that it's 51% or mining power, not 51% of bit coin users or even 51% of miners. If this were a designed system of voting it would be horribly corrupt, as people could essentially buy votes in the form of mining hardware. I'm still surprised you think that would be a good idea.

This. We all know that it's bad to put 100% of your saving in bitcoin (or any asset, honestly.) Your wage is the same way. I wouldn't want all my salary in bitcoin, but I would take a diversified salary of perhaps 20% bitcoin, 80% USD. Plus, portions like that allow you to avoid conversion expenses. If you get all USD you have to convert to bitcoin if you want to use bitcoin, and if you get all bitcoin you have to convert to USD for all your USD needs. If you request a ratio from your employer that matches your spending ratio, you can mostly avoid exchanges.
All employers interested in paying employees in bitcoin should look into this method.

Fractional reserve is not incompatible with bitcoin. You give them bitcoin, they loan bitcoin out and demand interest via contract. They get paid (usually) and they give you some of the profit. It works just as well with bitcoin as with other currencies.

That's... not how spaceflight works. There are a lot of reasons that going to Mars is much more expensive than going to the moon, but that's not one of them. For energy purposes, going a long distance in space isn't too difficult. In fact, I remember that the spacex dragon capsule they sent to the space station could have made it to mars with it's remaining fuel, it just would have taken six months to a year.
The real barriers to interplanetary human travel are:
1. Building a space craft large enough to live in for months/years
2. Preventing atrophy due to microgravity
3. Radiation shielding. The extra time spent in space and the distance from earth's magnetic field means radiation is significant.
4. Landing. A craft big enough to carry humans would be very heavy. Parachutes don't work in mars' thin atmosphere. Thrusters for a powered landing would be heavy for a craft of that size.
To sum it all up, a manned mission to mars would require the biggest space ship we've ever built, and that's just a one way trip. Getting back would be nearly impossible. We couldn't send them a launch craft all in one piece. Sending them one in parts and then sending them the fuel would take possibly hundreds of launches. It's just not practical.
So yeah. We agree that it wouldn't work. I just wanted to give a more accurate explanation of why it wouldn't work, at least not with a much larger budget.

That's not the argument though. No one debates that basic things like food and clothes, even luxuries, will still be purchased. The argument is about investment. The argument is that if you can get 2% on saving, why take risk and invest? This is valid to a certain extent... I have no doubt that in a bitcoin world there would be somewhat less investment. Even so, plenty of investments make more than 2%. Those investments will still be made.
In short, the argument is legitimate in that deflation does cause less vigorous investment. However, it's not catastrophic, investments will still be made. Slightly less investment is the price you pay for protection against inflation.

The earth's magnetic field protects us from radiation. Look up the magnetosphere for more information. The moon missions spent a lot of time inside it, such that they didn't have to worry about it killing them. The interplanetary space between earth and mars has no magnetosphere, so anyone going to mars without some form of shielding will be poisoned by radiation before they get very far. That's what I mean by it being a matter of location, not distance. The distance could be far shorter and radiation would still be a problem.

Not even faith in the government. It's faith that other people will accept the money. The source of value for bitcoin is the same as the dollar: other people wanting it.
Really, bitcoin is just a fancy ledger. It prevents counterfeiting, manages transactions, and controls the money supply. It's a good replacement for a checking account. It's fast compared to bank transfers. That by itself is good enough to drive acceptance. 
I will never understand why people need to tack their own radical views on top of that. I see people hating on banks, hating on government, claiming that bitcoin has some kind of democratic spirit...

I don't know why you even want to do that. The bank can do that far more efficiently than you can. Less work for you, too. Of course, the bank takes a cut.

Don't overreact. I didn't mean to make pirates out to be that big of a deal. I definitely understand that almost no ships get attacked by pirates.

They wouldn't bother for a single ship, or even a dozen ships tied together, but if this colony was successful enough it could be a target for criminals.

I get what you're trying to say. Calling it a currency won't make it a currency.

I think you're confusing the physical (?) Destruction of bitcoin with the destruction of bitcoin's future value. Making mistakes in how we present bitcoin could potentially prevent its adoption.
Bitcoin is fragile. Our market cap (the sum total of all value stored in bitcoin) is TINY. Tiny compared not only to other currencies but also quite low compared to the stocks of large companies. Don't be naive and believe that we can take the place of other currencies just because bitcoin is better. This will be a long, long haul.

It won't be any less complicated. Banks will still exist with bitcoin. People will still need loans, and people will still want that small interest from helping provide the money for those loans. Stocks will still exist, you'll buy them with bitcoin. Bonds will still exist, you'll buy them with bitcoin. Mortgages and investments of all kinds will still exist. The only thing that will change is that you don't use your banks for sending money long distance. Banks will go back to their real job of providing loans and other useful monetary permutations, and stop this profitable sideshow of holding everyone's money and being the only one capable of moving it quickly.
And that's in the unlikely situation where bitcoin takes over completely. That probably won't happen. Some currencies may crumble completely, but the stronger ones will hold on. So there will still be exchanges for dollars, euros, yen, etc. There will still be banks to hold those currencies.
All in all, bitcoin won't kill banks. What it will do is force them to change. Implement new features. Shrink a little if they can no longer make money on transfer and checking fees. It'll be work, but I'm not convinced that it will be so much work that they would fear it. I think that they fight it for more primal reasons. It's new. It's different. It's currently volatile. They don't have to lie to say that it looks bad from their point of view.

To the contrary, bitcoin is in a unique position because its value is determined by the number of people who choose to use it, while people don't usually choose among national currencies. The value of bitcoin does rise when it gets good publicity, just like a company's stock.

Does anyone else think bitcoin has a future as the currency of troubled countries? Americans don't have much incentive to move away from the dollar and aren't seriously considering it. But people who have to choose a currency because their official one is shaky are more likely to choose bitcoin. So maybe troubled countries will be the first to start using bitcoin as a major currency, and will thus give it the legitimacy to be accepted in the US.

Seller reputation is kind of what I meant. Retail stores allow for a large amount of seller reputation in one place.
For example, some friends of mine were recently looking at an ASIC from a new company. However, some research showed that it was likely (though not for certain) a scam. We would like to try ordering one to find out, but we can't afford to lose that much money on a bet with bad odds. Now imagine a retail store like amazon or newegg. They have lots of mercantile resources. They could afford to take that bet. And if they receive a working ASIC, they can buy them up and sell them retail. Users are insulated from what could be a scam. Sellers can prove themselves to one group and not have to go to extreme measures to prove they're the real deal. And customers can trust the store because lots of people have bought from them because they have a large selection.
So you see, retail isolates users from scams.

On the other hand, I did some serious digging into one of the companies claiming to be making those ASICs, and I'm convinced they're a scam intending to run off with their customers coins. So even if they're possible, I don't think anyone is making a litecoin asic. And there is some serious trouble with speeding up the algorithm, something about it being memory intensive. So unless they get a new algorithm that gives the same results with less memory they'll have trouble with it.
Not that it's clear that no asics is a good thing. It attracts miners, but I don't see how that attracts adoption.

I might agree with you, depending on what you mean by "way longer." But it has to come down eventually. It's way too high, too soon. I expect a drop, to perhaps 300, and then a slow increase back up to and past the current price. Just like last time. These things are cyclical.

I know you don't mean that literally, but think of the actual repercussions of that in our present situation. The value of the dollar would immediately decline. Most Americans would not have had time to move their money into another currency. No one would want to buy dollars. Millions of people's savings would become worthless. Bitcoin would experience a price spike and subsequent value oscillations so severe that the currency would be unusable for practical transactions for months at least. In the meantime, the national (and to a lesser extent, global) economy would crumble.
As with all revolutions, bitcoin has a choice between being gradual or being bloody.

The main thing I saw in the top comments was the assumption that bitcoin will always be too unstable to be a currency and that it would still be like that as an accepted currency. While I agree with them that the current volatility makes it completely unsuitable as a currency, I believe that that volatility would subside if it were more widely accepted. I agree with them that bitcoin has a volatility problem, I just don't think it's as permanent as they think it is.

Maybe. On one hand, crashes come from popular opinion. Maybe if the exchange goes down people will just stop trading because they have no info. But the more likely situation is that it starts to crash, the site goes down, and people continue to sell on other exchanges. The other exchanges get an unusual amount of BTC coming in to be sold. Even if people want to buy on the smaller exchanges, they may not be able to because USD takes more time to move. This will crush the exchange rates at the other exchanges. Then it's a question of what happens when gox goes back online.

I don't think we can blame gox for this. I think it would have happened anyway. New things get hype, hype has a bubble. The internet had a bubble associated with it, the dot-com bubble. Bitcoin gets one too. It's something all new things have to get out of their system. Now the hype will end and we can pick up where we left off, with prices in the $20-50 range. Hopefully with a nice, linear growth pattern that doesn't drive anyone crazy.
It's time to focus on the currency, people. Pay people in bitcoin, buy things in bitcoin, use it as intended. Stay away from the idea of bitcoin as a hot investment. That ship has sailed.

You're doing it wrong. Learn about how bitcoin is meant to be used, with a software wallet. With your coins stored in a wallet you just need the merchant's bitcoin address (often scanned as a qr code) and you can send them without any private key nonsense.

This is increasingly problematic to me. It used to be that anyone with a decent computer could mine and break even. Now with ASICs they can't. They need to invest in new hardware to break even. That means that the hashpower is transfered from the users to the companies that make hashing their business. It's a flaw in bitcoin's decentralization scheme.
Some people claim that ASICs prevent a 51% attack by making more hash power. But it really just lowers the number of people you need to compete against to complete the attack. Distributed work is important, not total amount of work.
@_date: 2013-03-26 04:13:58
You would think they would understand it, considering that they have to make the same decision themselves when they manage their investments. If you make a significant amount of money in long term stable investments you have to make the same decision about when to take your money out to spend and when to keep it in. The truth is that a deflating currency will cause hording to some degree, but everyone needs to take their money out sometime. Will the deflation be bad for economic activity? Maybe. I can see it hurting a little. But it's not going to kill the economy either, and the bitcoin algorithm protects us from other dangers such as, you know, inflation. So it's a price worth paying, in my mind.
Or I could be wrong. Maybe buying habits won't be at all affected by deflation. Maybe people will ignore deflation just as much as they currently ignore inflation when going about their daily lives. That's a perfectly reasonable possibility as well.
Even in the worst case scenario, deflation isn't bad enough to make bitcoin unviable. And in the best case scenario it's downright idyllic. So no worries.

Oh, I misread it as private key. This makes more sense.
@_date: 2013-04-01 04:41:44
Also, sometimes people attack bitcoin just because they didn't understand it right away. They may then proceed to attack harder to cover up their initial mistake. One of my friends was recently ranting about how bitcoin was "full of security holes". He's a fairly good programmer so I was willing to listen to what he had to say. It soon became clear that he did not understand bitcoin and was merely assuming it was flawed. First we walked through the code and he grudgingly had to admit that he couldn't see an errors. Then we talked about the protocol. At one point he tried to argue that he could counterfeit bitcoins by starting a new blockchain, and I had to politely remind him that different blockchains are considered separate currencies and you couldn't convince a client to accept a coin from a different blockchain. In the end he fell all the way back to arguing that bitcoin is an unethical use of processing power. It became painfully obvious that he had attacked without any foundation and was merely arguing to save face.
TL;DR some people, even smart people, can trick themselves into hating things for no reason.

a. What exactly is an ad-bubble?
b. Why is devaluing bitcoin a problem? Unless you're strictly an investor, the value of bitcoin isn't super important. Actual movement of bitcoin, including people donating and using it to buy food, will contribute to something much more important: the adoption and acceptance of bitcoin. Only if bitcoin becomes a major currency can it exert the stabilising influence that it was originally intended to achieve. Remember, bitcoin isn't meant to benefit the early adopters. That's just a side effect. It was intended to be a superior form of currency, one that could not be printed, counterfeited, or otherwise manipulated in ways that could harm the economy. Additionally, it provides a more efficient way of transmitting money over the internet, without involving banks and the inefficiencies inherent to any company. So the value doesn't matter. If bitcoin succeeds, the entire world benefits.
@_date: 2013-03-29 22:50:39
This is what we should be telling people. Downloading the QT client, or one of the other wallets, is the way to go. No fees and the service is there when your internet is. Plus the protection if your coins is in your hands only.
I think the problem is that people are used to banks. They don't understand that from the ownership perspective, bitcoin is cash. There is no benefit to leaving it with someone else. Online wallets don't provide interest or ease of money transfer so there's no reason to use them.
@_date: 2013-03-20 17:30:16
I think his question was more like "who would want to use a market order opposed to a limit order?" The answer would be that limit orders can sometimes let the market run away from you before they're executed, so people who want to make sure their order goes through might use market orders. The downside is that the market might move a great distance before the market order is filled.
Market orders work at the current trading price, limit orders work at a specified price or a better one.

It is true that in the case of reentering spacecraft, the heat is mainly due to compression of gas in front of the spacecraft instead of friction with the air.
If you're supersonic, the gas can't move away from the nose before being compressed. Compressed air heats up a lot.
If you're subsonic, the air can move away before being compressed, so the dominant heat production is from friction. Note that the constant introduction of fresh air is enough to prevent problematic heating.

Connotation is just as important as definition when it comes to public opinion. This is somewhat subjective, but I think many people think that virtual means "imaginary" or in some way removed from reality. Even though bitcoin is technically virtual, using that word makes people feel that it's less real than it actually is. Digital does not have this connotation. People have a clearer and less biased understanding of the word digital, so it's the better word to use.

This. People who have actually read the "guidance" will see that this merely clarifies the limits that are already on the exchanges. The guidance exempts people trading between Bitcoin and USD from the foreign exchange status, which is nice. I think that this will be good because it clarifies the way the government intends to deal with businesses accepting bitcoin, which will raise confidence. Some people act like we can afford to ignore the government. These people are disconnected from reality. Bitcoin can only realize its goal of becoming a widely accepted and stable currency if the government allows it through complacency. That is what seems to be happening.

I don't know how he knew, but usually a big rise like the one we had yesterday is followed by a significant drop to near the price where the rise started from. It then stabilizes somewhere between the two values and waits until the next big jump.

I was thinking it would be a consumer-led change. The government of the country may then choose to adopt it officially as a way to get out of their own failing currency.

It's true that there are multiple factors. I would break the effect you described in two: when you expect your money to be worth more later, you hoard. When your money is worth more than it was before, you spend. Neither principle is replaced by the other; they merely oppose each other. You are assuming that the first would win out completely, but we have evidence that it varies by person. Some people hoard completely, but others spend small portions. I argue that as bitcoin approaches a large value people will buy more with it. They will be richer (and thus whatever they're buying will be a smaller portion of their worth) and they will have less to gain from hoarding (right now we're seeing insane profits from hoarding, but in the far future when we have stable deflation it'll be less like taking money out of an investment and more like taking money out of a savings account). So use as a currency will increase after people have made their big gains.
