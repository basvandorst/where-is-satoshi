I didn't even mention the advantage of supporting the ecosystem. Using Bitwage contributes by flowing money from Big Finance to the individual, and boosting initiatives that seek efficiency. I see it as a win-win.

Hi there! I'm Fabiano Dias from Bitwage. I don't mean to be rude, but that is not the reality. I'll demonstrate here using exemples on the Corridor Brazil - US. 
A person in Brazil expecting a payment from the US would have only to send the bank information to his payer in the US. All the payer has to do is to send a Wire to his Brazilian collaborator, and the money gets a Brazilian bank account with a total fee of around 
a -)1,5% using Bitwage, as opposed to 2,5% of Transferwise. 
b-)1-day payment using Bitwage, as opposed to 3 to 5 days of Transferwise.
c-) Only one side need to signup to Bitwage.
The same is true if a Brazilian, buying btc from our partner FoxBit at 0,5% and sending over to the US, using today's (10/28 12 pm)exchange rate, the value would get to an American Account for
a-) 2,4 % using Bitwage as opposed to 2,5% of Transferwise 
b-)1-day payment using Bitwage, as opposed to 3 to 5 days of Transferwise.
c-) Only one side need to signup to Bitwage.
That is also true for several countries. Feel free to contact me and I can demostrate to you live, and see if it fits your operation. Contrary to what Kevin Bombino says, the more money in pocket comes using Bitwage, not Transferwise.
