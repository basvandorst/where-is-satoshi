Welcome to real world, now stop crying
@_date: 2018-01-03 15:46:08
hahahhaha how old are u dude? Go find something useful to do in your life, instead of scraping some sticker off of a pole... God this is cringey 
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:26:42
Are same people holding and people checking prices? Because why would you do that?
@_date: 2019-11-08 00:44:14
If bitcoin replaced dollar, then 1 btc will be... well 1 btc, and since there will not be any dollar to take perspective on, there will be no "moon". Right? :)
@_date: 2019-11-19 21:46:11
Yeah, no one can force a kid walking on $2k shoes to an alley and beat him up if he does not surrender the shoes, or watch, right? The theft is imaginary thing?
Your crypto is far more safe as if you do not visit the internet, you can not fall for scams.
I do not live in 3rd world country but I am far more relaxed to say that I bought 10 BTC on this anonymous website than to walk with expensive watch through poor neighborhood where someone can fuck me up

Trezor, as well as Ledgers, both offer apps for testing out seeds.
@_date: 2019-11-08 00:57:02
Bitcoin will go to 1M, I believe in that, but it will not replace any dollar...
@_date: 2019-11-19 23:37:31


That says to me that you are quite a negative person. Cheers mate, I hope it gets better for you and you find that thing that fills the void in you, which is now filled with negative energy.
@_date: 2019-11-22 21:05:37
Lol, so true.
Let me tell you why: OP is actually the one who is weak. He is insecure and he needs validation on Reddit so other "hodlers" will come and reassure him that everything will be all right
@_date: 2019-11-19 22:50:25
What downvote? Also, stop worrying about useless stuff in life and focus on more important things, you will thank yourself in few years. Also, fuck that negativity out here and use a language without curses. Curses are for in-eloquent people, and you can do better man, you are not an animal.
@_date: 2019-11-24 20:55:46
I agree. And also take into account that thousands of graphs are made every day lol
@_date: 2019-11-19 21:20:38
What is the issue? People all across the Instagram are bragging about expensive clothes and watches that are tens of thousands of dollars, but as soon as a guy says that he bought 100 usd of crypto, it's a big deal...
@_date: 2019-11-19 03:12:10
Bitcoin fans: People need to use and spend Bitcoin to raise awareness and bring it's price up!  
Also Bitcoin fans: You are doing it wrong if you want to buy things with Bitcoin...
@_date: 2019-11-19 21:19:02
lol... Go do something valuable with your life
@_date: 2019-11-22 21:02:40


You are stupid
@_date: 2019-11-14 16:09:52
Absolutely no lol
@_date: 2019-11-06 02:46:33
He does't know jack shit and if people keep not knowing nothing about the Bitcoin, Bitcoin will go nowhere.
@_date: 2019-11-08 00:51:35
100k of what? If dollar goes in flames and BTC replaces it, BTC will become 100k of what?
@_date: 2019-11-06 02:42:34
at 0:58 "I don't know what I am talking about"  
Are you kidding me u/TyKara ??
@_date: 2019-11-24 20:46:36
 **Dec 2, 2018**
@_date: 2019-11-12 23:13:04
So true...
I also think that feeling of entire ecosystem is so mixed and at the end of the day, big players will decide your feelings, literally.
@_date: 2019-11-08 21:25:06
By "overall trend" he means the next 2-3 weeks...
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:41:31
Is it really possible to crack a password protected wallet in reasonable time?
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:41:54
!RemindMe 2 weeks BTC
@_date: 2017-08-31 08:05:27
What happened???
@_date: 2019-10-27 13:23:52
Remember, it's only a profit if you sell back to fiat...
@_date: 2019-10-26 16:43:41
Nice cringe
@_date: 2019-10-28 18:29:06
This is most realistic one so far
@_date: 2019-10-31 22:44:23
You are an idiot. Stop drinking, learn financial management and smart investing, and talk with your wife before any major moves like that. Stop being an idiot, your family will thank you.
@_date: 2019-12-05 23:33:26
But OP is not going around the Reddit and DMing people. You are just talking nonsense...
@_date: 2019-12-06 00:46:07
So if a burglar goes inside your home and tries to kill you, but you kill him instead, are you really guilty?
@_date: 2019-12-02 00:45:22
True, but like 99% of people are not in position to just move from a country lol, so your answer might not be applicable to all people
@_date: 2019-12-19 03:03:43
Going after how exactly on this anonymous site?
@_date: 2019-12-29 14:49:23
@_date: 2018-03-17 00:53:45
When I see PSA in the tittle, I automatically know that OP is an idiot 
@_date: 2018-02-09 13:38:29
One ad article powered by Vodafone is not going mainstream lol
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:28:52




Whose idea was this
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:26:58
Agreed. We are definitely going in the right direction
@_date: 2018-02-18 23:16:41


The feeling when you need to justify yourself so you dont get banned by a trigger happy mod. lol what a joke of a person you are. zero integrity.
