Oh, it's still blowing up. SR2 has as much drama as a Spanish soap opera.

The worse it gets the funnier the joke is.

The longer you've been on reddit the bigger your dick is. It's a measuring contest.

Doge was being gamed on cryptsy today. Actual spread was between 150-160. The 200 ask was for small amounts of 100-200 Doge. Don't whine because you don't know how the game is played. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 21:05:12
Because some people like viewing cryptos like sports teams rather than currency. You can only cheer for one and the others are going to fail.

Mt. Goyim holds all your BTC.

This is actually good for bitcoin.

The ride never ends.

I agree but he's 420 college dude bro. He's just excited about spending his bitcoin and wanted to share. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:18:00
Run it into the ground!
@_date: 2014-06-29 18:36:40
No one gives a shit anymore China.
@_date: 2014-02-18 14:14:30
People who got in early are hoarding and don't want to share their ActualMoney. It's such a broken system.

I wish cutting up pizza meant I had infinite pizza.

We actually clap while being searched by the TSA. It's an inspection required for our continued freedom.

The only sure fire method to avoid government dectection is to become a mennonite.

You sound like a fun guy who loves fun.
@_date: 2014-02-18 01:16:09
It's all in good fun. We apply crypto logic to fiat. Feds control the only mining pool and we have major problems with users having their wallets stolen by thrives. It's a sad state of affairs with AcutalMoney.

Why did you even post this here? Nothing rustles more jimmies than posting dogecoin to @_date: 2014-02-21 17:07:54
You might be on to something. Maybe it could be the fairly large sum of cash.

The briefcase in Pulp Fiction. What's in it? Such mystery.

I'm calling in to work now so I can quit!
@_date: 2013-12-14 02:24:16
The part that doesn't make sense to me is that if the site was hacked why do they still keep it up? It's clear to me now that it is a scam. I feel dumb for thinking a site advertised on reddit was safe. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 16:55:42
Hey, I just wanted to follow up with you to say I got my refund as well. Since BTC has lost value since I first bought I have a little extra left over to spend on myself. Looks like everything worked out! 
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:48:13
I was dumb and used the service as well thinking it was legit since it was advertised on Reddit. Here is the email I got from them:
**Hi HIPSTER_GARABE,**
**Our website was hacked and our master record was destroyed.  The good thing is, as stated, your purchase is covered by Paypal.  However our Paypal API is still down as we're fixing the site and thus are unable to manually provide you with a refund.  To obtain one, please initiate a dispute via Paypal**

Who could forget the 'Dark Tipper'?
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:30:45
Well, you can still buy drugs with them.

EDIT: Downvotes? SERIOUSLY REDDIT?
