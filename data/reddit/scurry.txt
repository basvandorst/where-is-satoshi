Honestly, why don't you even have a debit card?

Is there a way for the recipient to know where the payment came from? Like, say I was selling something in r/bitmarket. Could I just put the QR code in the listing so people can buy instantly, and be able to verify that the payment came from the right person?

Do you need to be a member of Chase or Wells Fargo to use them to send cash?

But isn't MtGox's big 500k account actually filled with the customer's coins? So by rolling back the transactions, they *are* helping the customers.. you make it seem like MtGox is only doing it to help themselves.

How do I set a limit on the usage? Cause right now when it's running, everything else on my computer slows down. Even just browsing in Firefox is laggy.

Sudden implies unexpected. If you've been following Bitcoin for any significant amount of time, you'd know this is not sudden at all. The prices have always been this volatile. 
@_date: 2011-06-09 03:35:08
In that case, I might buy some while they're down..

The eight instances is what killed you. You could've skipped the CPU and it would've only taken slightly longer to mine a block, while saving you eight times as much money. That would've been $2.10/hour, or $50.40 a day. You would've only made a dollar a day, but still.
Unless I misunderstand the pricing.
@_date: 2011-12-10 20:45:28
The questions aren't dumb, though. Without the screening process they have now, the whole place would be overflown with people who don't know what they're doing and it would be a mess to moderate.

4 5850's overclocked would get you about 1.4Ghash/s (1.2-ish stock). They're a much better bang for your buck than the 6970's.

A paper trail that doesn't really lead to anywhere. They might be able to tell that someone is laundering money, but that doesn't really do them any good if they can't figure out who it is.

I'm using Kiv's gui, and nothing's using my CPU. I don't see any framerate options.

Mining is crucial for the operation of the network, but I agree with your other point.
@_date: 2011-05-11 01:02:22
Ohh okay thanks. Kinda screwed myself over there.
Do people generally do 1:1 transactions or is it like "I'll give you $45 for your $50 mtgusd" to make money themselves?
@_date: 2011-05-10 23:15:01
I only mined for one night while Slush was down, and I was just credited with 18 btc earlier today. Goes without saying I won't be using Slush anymore.
So. A lot.

Yeah, man, soon as I click apply in Overdrive, it lowers my clocks down to 840 (or whatever overdrive is set to), even if I use Afterburner first. Then if I go back to afterburner and bump it up to 900 and click apply, I can see the settings in Overdrive reset. What version of CCC are you using?
@_date: 2011-06-06 04:54:31
I'm going to chalk it up to different designs in our cards, but I'll still try messing around with it a bit more anyway. Thanks for your help either way :)

After my bank was successfully added and verified, I sent money from Dwolla to my bank on the 13th, and I got it on the 17th. So that's four days. Its slow in comparison to instant credit card transactions and such, but its not really unusable, and you're getting a great service out of it. Be patient. 
@_date: 2011-06-02 04:42:56
Depends on your target currency. For USD, the easiest way is to set up an account with Dwolla and Mt Gox. Sell the bitcoins on Mt Gox, and transfer the money to Dwolla, which can then be withdrawn into your bank account. You can also sell on the forums using a bunch of other services too.

That said, the value of bitcoin has increased by several thousand percent since even as recently as just a year ago.
@_date: 2011-05-19 14:30:14
Replace the 6970's with 5850's. $100 less and just as powerful. 
@_date: 2011-05-20 03:18:36
Neat. Maybe we could put one in the sidebar?
@_date: 2011-05-24 02:07:51
Wait, the amount of bitcoins you have isn't stored in the wallet? How does that work?
@_date: 2011-05-18 14:57:55
Since you created your account or since you linked and verified your bank?

I use MSI Afterburner to overclock, and I can't really use both that and Overdrive. If I turn Overdrive up 20% then when I overclock with Afterburner, Overdrive resets to default. And I can't use Overdrive for overclocking because it limits me to 840 Mhz.
@_date: 2011-05-09 23:27:50
I was under the impression that there would be some sort of magical on-the-fly BC-to-dollar conversion, so I could use it like a credit card or something.
I guess I can see its use if people start trading for bitcoins "in real life", but that still seems to be a ways off from now.
@_date: 2011-06-06 04:16:59
Yeah that's how I have my config file. Still can't figure it out. Most of the time Overdrive actually glitches up if I have my clocks set over 840 in Afterburner. The sliders and settings disappear [like this.]( Even if we both have 6950's, that doesn't necessarily mean our cards both overclock the same remember. [This]( is the particular card that I have. Other manufacturers will use different designs that may allow for a better overclock.

The price of AMD stock has rather sharply declined in the last month, while interest in bitcoin has increased dramatically.

He's said on the forums that he has to do the transfers manually after getting the "You've received money!" email from Dwolla. He has a job, sleeps, etc, so his availability is variable. He's not a scammer, though (you think he wouldn't have been found out by now?), so just relax and have some patience.
@_date: 2011-05-18 22:23:25
I've never added funds from my bank to Dwolla, but sending money from Dwolla to my bank only took four days. A long-ass time compared to instant credit card transactions, but not really unusable.
It's still a million times better than fucking with Liberty Reserve.
@_date: 2011-12-10 18:35:52
No, they shouldn't. Fortunately, it will never happen.
@_date: 2011-05-13 22:53:54
How *would* someone fake a block to begin with? If I send someone some BTC, why should they have any reason to believe it might be fake when it shows up on their computer with no confirmations yet?
@_date: 2011-06-05 17:38:40
I wasn't at the time. I am now and get 340 at 900Mhz. I can't push it any further than that without losing stability. 
@_date: 2011-05-09 22:56:30
I don't get it. How would I buy something with one of these in person?
@_date: 2011-05-09 23:29:59
That would be a pretty dick move at the moment, when most people wouldn't even have any idea what these are, let alone have any real use for them.
@_date: 2011-05-10 23:36:36
~400 Mhash/s, and I think overnight and some of the next day. Maybe 12-20 hours.

Bitcoin Wallet is only for testnet. There isn't any app that you can use to send and receive transactions in the real world yet.
@_date: 2011-05-09 23:51:58
Yeah, make them research what the hell bitcoins are, how they work, and how to sell them, find someone online to sell them to, and sign up for at least one service (possibly multiple) they probably don't already have an account for to handle the transaction, then wait a few days for everything to go through and actually have the money arrive in their bank account. For a three dollar tip.
Come on. It's a neat idea for existing bitcoiners to trade in person, but using it as a tip is just wasting someone's time and making it a pain in their ass to get their reward for good service.

@_date: 2013-04-03 05:39:05
I would strongly suggest waiting for this burst to end (and it will), then buying when they settle back down to 60 or 70 or whatever they settle to. Then sell when it spikes to 100+ again (and it will). I've been following bitcoins for a few years, back when they were $3-5 whenever that was. 100+% spikes have not been uncommon for as long as I've been watching, but they never last longer than a month or so before settling on a new price, somewhere around 25-50% greater than what they were before the spike.
In other words, lets say your target is to make a 100% increase in profit. If you bought now, you'd have to sell when they reached $240/pop. We are more likely to see a drop to 60 and an increase to 120 again long before we see it reach 240.
