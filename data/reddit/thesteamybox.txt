What? Like the improved throughput of Segwit?
@_date: 2018-05-07 09:06:49
segwit is soooo 2017....lightning is the future
@_date: 2018-05-14 10:32:08
year on year rly....
@_date: 2018-05-14 10:36:16
yeah pretty much...it's definitely some sort of economic oddity ...
@_date: 2017-01-11 09:10:16
He's not around...&amp; it's not his problem...it's something the consensus has to sort out...and that is exactly how he intended it to work
You want some Vitalik figure you can ask to wade into every issue and HF when we can't all get along? (I'm not sure you'd like how that would turn out...considering you're collectively wiping your ass on his whitepaper right now) you may be in the wrong coin
@_date: 2017-01-11 08:41:13
You realise that the characteristics of 'medium of exchange' and 'store of value' are pretty much the same thing and that there is a symbiosis between them? It's can't really be one without the other
and that the possible distant recognition of it as a national currency has nothing to do with it being an effective 'medium of exchange' right now
@_date: 2017-01-11 08:58:56
Who said it has to be '1st world'? why not where it is needed now in remittances and other cross border money flows or for the unbanked (yet seemingly internet capable) without the monopoly of modern banking?
It's already a store of value (I bought my 1 BTC for $90AUD and I've not had a problem...until I started reading some of this 'next gen' thinking on the matter) and it's because I did that so long ago (i.e. the network effect) is why far quicker (and now less deluded) coins haven't stolen BTCs march
Let me put it this way...if you got charged 40c for a $3 coffee...would you switch from the dollar to BTC? I bet you know the answer to that
@_date: 2017-01-11 09:17:04
It's not going to be the reserve currency of the world and if it is...it's so fcuking far from there right now...but as a store of value it's not the bond market either so the comparison is moot
The characteristics of a 'medium of exchange' and 'a store of value' are 1 and the same
stop supporting fcuking one for the other because in the end...that will kill both and we'll all lose
@_date: 2017-08-22 10:42:02
Its going to be added as a commit, take it, get the best of both worlds...or fork away into obscurity
@_date: 2017-08-24 11:00:10
or you've finished transacting with the other party
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:52:12
How are you preventing mining centralisation exactly
Full nodes just ignore tranasactions, mining nodes will accept them as valid
How is 1MB too big?
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:30:51
Quit pulling numbers out of your ass
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:34:43
Very nice...
It's a shame they can't unfuck your current hashpower/fees/transactions issues
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:04:56
Of course it is (no more than a 50% pullback from the high though).
I've been in this game since 2013...I know exactly how this works and crashes don't phase me anymore...
the utility of the old BTC before 1MB/RBF/Segwit coup...now that's something that *does* interest me...and quite a few others
We can have this conversation again...in 18 months...when you sort out the lightning network
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:45:35


**the Market** is walking away from the core implementation right in front of your fcuking eyes...and you still can't see it
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:39:02
It's from a time when full node and miner (and wallet) were synonymous...what it means is that as long as the majority of nodes (miners) acted honestly (didn't try to fuck the system) the dishonest nodes (miners) would be ignored
SPV wallets were seen to be fine for everybody else as long as the miners as a whole (or 51%) didn't come together for sheenanigans
This has since turned into full nodes and silly hats secure bitcoin and if the blocks are too big for people to run full node on raspberry pis and 5 year old rigs the miners will rip everybody (including themselves) off
Simple! (and you are currently watching all this magical thinking fall apart)
@_date: 2017-11-04 07:35:41
you better hold it...you'll lose a fair percentage in fees moving it otherwise
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:01:31
I did it 2 days ago but I sold my BTC :D
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:25:24
Well I suppose it's not a complete loss then...
Good luck!
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:24:20
When Gox shut it went down 50% to $600 (it's the blip in 2014)
It took another year to get to $200 and that had the 1st China ban and the Silk Road by then
Price isn't your problem now anyway...hashing power is
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:45:38
Thanks but no thanks...I'm not really interested in segwit coins...they don't work the way I want them to
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:15:39
Running nodes doesn't do shit...running *mining* nodes however...
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:44:44
fork.lol that's how you know it's an 'attack'
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:56:15
90%?!?! when the fcuk has it ever gone  down that much?!?!
Mt Gox was 50% and that's the biggest I was ever in and neither of the China Banhammer sessions were that far
You tell the noobs this now?!?! this is not sneezing you clueless fcuk...this is the end of 4 years of arguing about the block size
There's **no parallel** in BTCs short history to what is unfolding in this fork situation
@_date: 2016-09-27 07:55:41
how is it irrelevent? is this greatly increased amount of transaction not going to require settling on the main chain?
@_date: 2016-09-29 07:34:45
I'm not talk about how much it costs...each side chain will eventually become a transaction on the main chain regardless of how many micro transactions it may have settled
@_date: 2017-10-28 03:01:19
What do you think they're paid in?!?! lettuce leaves?!?!
