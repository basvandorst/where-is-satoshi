if you own 51% of the network, you can change the fundamental rules of the bitcoin software. its far more dangerous than just having a shit load of btc.
@_date: 2014-09-02 16:58:05
haha, this survey is going to be distributed to more than just @_date: 2014-03-10 19:56:49

Something has to generate your wallet. Use any service you wish.
@_date: 2014-11-23 18:39:19
Benefits the user will immediately notice:
* It's really easy to make a transaction (with good wallet software)
* Lower transaction fees (just today my friend was charged 52p for a £9.50 transaction)
* Sense of trust you don't experience with a bank.
Behind the scenes benefits you may not notice:
* Security. Mathematically provable transactions.
* Fast transactions. Instant network notification and insertion into the blockchain within ~10 minutes.
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:00:37
Your use of commas is... interesting.
@_date: 2015-07-14 15:49:50
Didn't mention any disadvantages of Bitcoin, something a school board would probably want to know about.
@_date: 2013-04-21 15:33:46
We'll see who's laughing... *evil chuckle*
@_date: 2013-03-27 18:30:34
Ah, I poked around MtGox a bit more and realised a way!
@_date: 2013-04-06 14:26:58
You can't use a bitcoin asic miner to mine litecoins.
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:51:45
The primary reason why I love it ;)
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:28:04
Where do you suggest the money goes?

Not a single link karma has been awarded from this -_-

Or rather than using a url to identify each "account", use php variables in the URL.

Thankyou! Thinks are going to get complicated soon!
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:27:10
Controlled supply. Blocks are generated roughly one per 10 minutes. Each block gives out 25 bitcoins. This number halves every 210,000 blocks. Until the reward is 0. Thus a market cap of 21 million bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:08:02
Drake, you know how the price sometimes goes up, well there's this thing, called the price going down. It's not the apocalipse.
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:42:52
Why on earth would you buy before the weekend? Research your market, the price has a habit of dipping several dollars on weekends.
@_date: 2013-04-14 18:29:02
Do not use this program. Absolutely do not think hashing something twice is more secure, it is weaker. Also, be aware that hashing without salt is almost as weak as not hashing at all.
@_date: 2013-05-12 14:54:09
Custom number plates can't be that expensive?
@_date: 2013-04-05 22:22:27

@_date: 2013-04-02 15:17:19
As you can see from the comments, there are already widely accepted terms for smaller fractions of the bitcoin. Its being debated as to whether or not it's time to start using these smaler denominations when referring to the currency or not.

Ok, so cancel does cancel, just takes like 3 minutes... god damn it mtgox!

A torrent would be the best way to distribute it. :)

Mtgox, you can setup a direct bank transfer method for cashing out your pounds.

Next part will be looking at bitcoin economics :)
@_date: 2013-04-06 16:00:38
Media started to give report on bitcoin, this kinda snowballed. Sent lot's of people into a buying frenzy. Also some people think cyprus is to blame, but I'm not too sure.
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:39:03
How about having to wait for transaction confirmations, or the possibility of bitcoin being crushed by governments? It is simply too risky and investment to make, it would cost millions in infrastructure.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:09:35
1. There aren't 10000 transactions per second. Theres far less.
2. Pooled mining is the most effective way of earning money from mining.
3. Easier said than done.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:40:07
Yes they did, this was so people could auto-buy bitcoins when money came into accounts. Very stupid, glad they've changed this.
@_date: 2013-04-27 09:58:00
if you spot any of these scam comments, please downvote them to get 'em hidden :)
EDIT: Report as well
@_date: 2013-03-23 19:43:34
Ahh, thanks!
@_date: 2013-04-04 17:22:11
This is ridiculous. Don't you realize? Bitcoin means different things to different people. To some its about mining, to others trade or speculation and to some it's business opportunity. Can you not see that?
@_date: 2013-04-06 16:02:51

@_date: 2013-03-29 09:31:10
This week-old article is saying nothing new.
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:59:58
Not going to happen in the forceable future. But I guess we would see an influx of price.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:48:27
You got downvotes because this is just a ridiculous senario, not actually how bitcoin will crash. Please no reposts.
@_date: 2013-04-02 20:52:09
 Fine, "re-wording".
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:44:36
So you're kinda just guessing, not a prediction of any kind.
@_date: 2013-04-05 18:15:20
I totally agree, it's simply too tricky to get hold of Bitcoins in some parts of the world.
@_date: 2013-04-06 11:07:04
It's more likely for Bitcoin to collapse than a large company to go bust.
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:46:58
Yeh, because limiting to 1BTC wouldn't fuck anybody over...
@_date: 2013-04-15 18:31:38
@_date: 2013-04-24 19:19:15
So is this basically just a fancy paper wallet?
@_date: 2013-03-24 19:36:18
Some more accounts will be funded later tonight
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:49:13
Those other exchanges will suffer just as badly as MtGox if we all pile in.
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:39:18
FYI, the next part will be on mining! Should be a long episode, and will be very in-depth (looking at difficulty, etc.)
@_date: 2013-04-14 15:01:18
Go away.
@_date: 2013-04-06 14:46:21
Not sure why the downvotes, this is a really cool concept.
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:28:17
Database issue. Either coinlab's moving in or litecoin trading database  being added.

7 transactions a second equates to about 4200 transactions per block. That's over quadruple the current amount we see per block on the blockchain.
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:14:54
Please, for those who don't know what your talking about, a little background info?
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:53:37
1. Look at the number of transactions found in a block.
2. Its about, 200-700 a block.
3. Blocks are designed to be generated 1 per 10 minutes.
4. Thats 20-70 a minute.
5. Which is 0.3 - 1.6 a second.
Now tell me we need to scale up to 10,000 a second.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:14:05
My bad, it was down for a couple of hours earlier
@_date: 2013-04-05 09:13:59
Rubbish fake. Clearly a new account, no verification.
@_date: 2013-04-14 16:39:55
Do you see the network suffering from SatoshiDICE? No. The network is not being 'ddosed'. If it didn't say the transactions were to SD, nobody would think twice about it.
@_date: 2013-04-05 13:46:21
It's hard to know. Instawallet certainly held millions of dollars worth of bitcoins, but judging by the refund scheme, it seems most were kept safe. Either that or the refunds are coming straight from their profits.
@_date: 2013-04-14 17:11:05
* Average transactions per block is 330.073 (blockexplorer.com)
* 4200 transactions is a 12x increase
Also, you can't possibly be serious about comparing the subreddit users or volume depth to transactions per block.

The more companies that start to accept BTC, the higher the value. Its really thanks to reddit and other major sites that the BTC is $50! If you wanna make some cash, get contacting!
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:20:27
Even if the price increases to $1000, one dollar will be 100,000 satoshi. Kinda extreme.

@_date: 2013-04-10 18:19:02
It has cancelled behind the scenes, the lag just puts a delay on your seeing it.
@_date: 2013-04-06 09:35:22
This is only true if the 51% all download the same, new version of the Bitcoin software. So yes, havoc would be caused.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:00:08
Exactly :)
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:08:00
Ban memes.
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:06:09
Bitcoin is so utterly genius, everything has been thought through. With the potential exception of the &gt;50% attack, fuck knows how to solve that problem.
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:21:30
I agree, MtGox lag is a bummer, but the service has great potential.
@_date: 2013-04-07 08:07:02
This is just a link to a post from another subreddit. Which defeats the point of having a different subreddit.
@_date: 2013-04-05 14:25:29
It's nice, not a big fan of the safe though, seems clunky in design.
@_date: 2013-03-23 17:34:51
Say the bitcoin has been decreasing for a few hours. Noobs might take this as a sign of a crash, but its really just a minor temporary dip in price. This is a bear trap. The issue is if people get tricked by bear traps and rush to a trader to sell their coins, then a real crash can occur.
@_date: 2013-04-07 13:35:27
@_date: 2013-04-06 15:53:38
Computing power is not **directly** to do with security, but to ensure blocks are generated 10 per minute.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:16:17
Hmm. Interesting. Website slightly confusing though. Its all a bit jumbled and doesn't properly explain how to play.
@_date: 2013-04-06 14:21:59
Don't feel apologise to me, be sorry that you're so ignorant you can't take some criticism. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:58:11
Anyone who's watched bitcoin's value from '11 will know thats not true.
@_date: 2013-04-13 13:02:08
bounced right back suggests to the price it fell from, which was about $260
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:52:38
I agree, as a currency, bitcoin's current state is dire. But it will level out, eventually.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:15:28
Even the biggest sites suffer from DDoS attacks and need for maintenance, ass hole.
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:01:44
Yes but Amazon would most likely redirect fee's between various wallets they own, and recipient wallets. But this is a fair point.

@_date: 2013-04-07 13:39:12
mtgox cant change the exchange rate themselves. The whole point is that the price is set by the users.
@_date: 2013-05-29 10:24:47
the weusecoins video is concise and professional. This video is poorly  made, and 3 minutes long (thats long for an advert)!
@_date: 2013-04-04 18:40:42

@_date: 2013-04-03 00:01:28
Go fuck yourself.
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:53:12
No, there is just retarded lag on MtGox.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:18:40


Your not reading what I'm saying. I'm talking about if another exchange was faced with equal traffic of MtGox today.
@_date: 2013-03-29 09:32:49
Use metaphorical language, not too many technical words. Keep it concise and clean.
@_date: 2013-04-06 14:34:16
No, if bitcoin trading sites shut down, bitcoin software stops being distributed, general decrease of bitcoin related sofware/websites
@_date: 2013-04-05 14:04:05

There are already seperate subreddits for trading and mining. I'm happy with how things currently are.
@_date: 2013-04-06 11:11:10
That's really nothing special...
@_date: 2013-03-26 23:10:39
GoDaddy accepting bitcoin, would be massive.
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:04:17
"fixed inflation"
pretty sure the difficulty algorithm and gradually decreasing block generation reward is doing this already.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:45:42
You again. Why don't you stop whining, pack your stuff, and get the fuck out. MtGox weren't ddos'ed, it was just lots of people using the site.
@_date: 2013-04-05 13:23:22
Exactly. It was frightening that the service was so trusted. All it took was access to the root of the webserver (hidden behind just 1 password), and your in. After that its just wallet galore.
@_date: 2013-04-22 06:47:14
Please, don't post a question and not answer it. That graph tells us nothing.

It's about time!
@_date: 2013-04-05 19:27:33
Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of a safe. I'm saying the actual design of it is clunky and, to be honest, bad.
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:56:57
* Payment processing (wallets, database implementation, etc).
* Implementing bitcoin costs to all items (includes live conversions and other functionality).
* Establishing some sort of 'deal' with a Bitcoin exchange (they would want it to be automated).
* Promotion, advertisements, publicity.
* Relaying money/bitcoins to the retailers.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:40:27
You cant blame an exchange for the crash, its mainly stupid "investors" who have no idea what their doing.
@_date: 2013-04-03 08:55:26

MtGox isn't naming them, as they fear they'll hide themselves further.
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:43:59
Wrong, look at real-world exchanges. They have a massively higher trade volume, and are fine.
@_date: 2013-04-13 10:44:32
it hasn't "bounced right back"

I'm planning on doing a bitcoin presentation to my economics class soon. If I can gather about 0.2BTC or more in tips, I plan on separating it out into 20 wallets and giving out those wallets on cards to students in my class!

Good for you...
@_date: 2013-04-05 13:20:35
It's kind of hard to talk about uncontrolled supply because bitcoin can't exist without it. It's a built in feature to the blockchain, without it, there is no blockchain.
@_date: 2013-04-06 15:56:22
Nobody here is talking about this being a likely event. This is just a **theoretical** series of events that could **theoretically** kill bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-05 16:22:04
Where the hell have you got those numbers from? Transaction fee's will be adjusted if a consensus is reached among the majority of nodes in the network.
@_date: 2013-03-29 08:21:32
It's harder to obtain in the real world, much harder.
@_date: 2013-04-02 20:41:15
Your point, please.
@_date: 2013-04-02 20:22:14
This is not an **analysis**, this is looking at what we need to do the get bitcoin to actually grow into something anybody can use, regardless of technological background. Its really not that tricky to comprehend. If you disagree with points, you should state your opinion.
@_date: 2013-04-07 22:17:47
Doesn;t the bitcoin price auto-adjust?
@_date: 2013-03-31 14:56:06
8 d.p
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:49:21
Part 4 will be on controlled supply.
@_date: 2013-04-05 14:11:15
Fuck off
@_date: 2013-04-02 20:27:32
Its not entirely clear, but in point 3, I'm talking about buying physical goods directly from big companies, not a 3rd party.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:31:30
Yes. Click the button, wait however long the mtgox lag is, and it will register your click.
@_date: 2013-03-24 19:44:46
Most people who want to use bitcoin 100% anonymously are most likely engaging in illegal activity, therefor they wont be publicly associated their wallet with themselves anywhere. I don't really see the issue here?
@_date: 2013-04-01 11:57:49
Oh I love weekdays!
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:57:10
If they are stolen wallets, its unlikely for two to be the same persons.

If you just looked on the site you would know its down
@_date: 2013-04-06 09:43:34
Gonna get som hate, but this looks light it was made by a 5-year-old. You can see the an orange line when you tried to connect rectangles onto the B. It needs more detail, to look more professional and less silly.
@_date: 2013-04-02 20:36:19
1. Yes if your American, its easy. Most of the world isn't. I'm also talking about everyday people, with no real background in computers.
2. My point is highlighting the media giving *false* information about bitcoin, not so much their mockery.
3. This is a fair point, I guess statement 3 is jumping the gun.
4. Agreeable, the price is probably too volatile to get traction from the majority.
@_date: 2013-04-02 20:00:59
Its fricking awesome. To think that people who bought bitcoins just weeks ago have doubled their money!
@_date: 2013-04-05 18:44:39
I hope so :P
@_date: 2013-04-01 19:35:51
No thanks. Theres far to much to say in just comments. Also, because of how reddit comments are ordered chronologically by default, good posts would get lost.
@_date: 2013-04-02 20:30:16
Nothing major, a fixing a grammar here and there.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:03:17

Firstly, your understanding of a DDoS attack is wrong. Such an attack is just lots of various clients around the world pinging the server. It's like somebody coming up to you in real life and saying "hello, hello, hello..." until you kill yourself. The reason its hard to block, is servers find it hard to tell the difference between the real ping and a ping that is from an attacker. Hope this helps.

Don't worry, it'll get there. MtGox have some issues with Bitcoin deposits. I tried to transfer some this morning and it took about an hour. Give it 3, and if it takes longer, contact them.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:42:47
It's funny because your blaming them for bitoin owners for selling.
@_date: 2013-04-06 16:07:19
I don't see your argument to what I'm stating.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:05:14
Thanks for asking. The purpose of unlocking a block is that in doing so, transactions are validated, and dodjy ones are rejected from the network. This is however, a just the surface of how it all works. The likelihood of nobody unlocking a block is immensely slim, near to impossible, it will never be a potential risk for bitcoin's survival.

* BTC comes with a fee if you want a quick transaction, which they would.
* BTC would have a small impact on profits, most people would actually just be converting from fiat to bitcoin, thus meaning no profit gain.
* It would cost amazon millions to set-up needed infrastructure, would it be worth it? Probably not.
* They haven't invested millions into setting up their own currency just to have it made redundant by bitcoin.

Thats what scares me most about MtGox lag! Trying to cancel and order and it taking 5 minutes!
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:55:39
We have a system for this already.
1 mBTC = 0.0001 BTC
1 uBTC = 0.000001 BTC
1 Satoshi = 0.00000001 BTC
@_date: 2013-04-06 09:35:59
What you are saying makes no sense. Transactions are validated **by mining**. So you can't have 51% without validating transactions.

custom built computer chips designed to only mine bitcoins.

That paste was made yesterday, I highly doubt this was a planned attack. Seems bullshit to me.
I will gladly take a look at the link on the HW. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-04-05 16:18:46
Seems harsh calling it an attack.

You usually buy the dollar equivalent of the product, in bitcoins. So if the bitcoin price changes, it adjusts to the dollar worth.

This is a scam.

About not seeing tweets about bitcoin, or about spreading the use of bitcoin via social networks?
@_date: 2013-03-29 09:27:55
Give me some solid evidence, facts and figures, then come back.
@_date: 2013-04-06 07:27:20
This is a well-known issue called the 51% attack. Theoretically the person holding more than half of the mining power could control the supply. However we can survive perfectly well from the 11 million coins we already have. And it would also make bitcoins more scare, causing a price surge (up).
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:54:53
A bubble is a definition of the pattern, not scale. 
The bitcoin could go to a trillion dollars, and still potentially be a bubble.
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:08:22
Behalf of everyone? Well not me. It would be more helpful if you linked to an add-on rather than claiming this bullshit. A ticker will not *suddenly flood this subreddit* with speculation spam as if a magical live bitcoin chart is a revolution...

1. Google is banned in China.
2. Google was a competitor to Jeeves (another search engine)
3. This is close. Look up from the text, a google search bar.
Thats all I got.

It is actually a scam. Different URL, the image is from blockchain.info, and its not advertised anywhere on the homepage of SD. Idiot.

Paypal will shut you down like every other bitcoin transactor before you get screwed by chargebacks.
You've clearly failed to do a little research.

Bitstamp doesnt even let me sign up as a UK resident. Its not in the country list. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:32:05
Amazon has recently launched it's own currency, so I doubt they will get on board. They also don't accept PayPal, which is far bigger than Bitcoin. 
Considering the fact that they made $61 billion revenue last year, I find it unlikely that they're under any pressure to accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-05 13:18:02
Instawallet was a stupid idea. The bitcoins were simply guarded by a URL, making it relatively easy to hack. Blockchain.info, while not being un-hackable, is much more secure.
@_date: 2013-04-07 09:27:27
Done :)
@_date: 2013-03-31 19:03:55
Hell, if it crashed to $1 a coin, it wouldn't have to return to $90 for some serious profit to be made.

There putting bitcoin in a negative light because the guy on the right was talking about what if the "people in charge" started printing more. US news TV is total shite.

Early, as in cheap.
@_date: 2013-04-05 18:14:12
The issue is that this is not breaking any rules. Just somebody trading very frequently. Yes it's spammy, and may cause lag, but its none of MtGox's business to shut 'em down.

Controlled Supply my friend. Its to ensure Bitcoins are distributed at a constant rate until the limit of 21 million BTC is reached in the year 2140.

I started of buying £30 worth from Blockchain.info. Since then I've been playing the markets, selling here, buying there. Keeping cautious while making money. I'm not in for any big money, just for fun.

Surely the higher the value of the bitcoin as time progresses, the harder it is to gain 50% of the networks hash power?
