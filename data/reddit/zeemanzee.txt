Better wording might be: I tried to donate to you but unfortunately you don't yet take bitcoin. Please let me know when you do so I can give you my money.

so shipping is covered now...? it wasn't a month ago; maybe only in the US and not Canada?

yeah Bitcoin's digital gold isn't much use in the long term if we don't have machines (Ethereum) and oil (Ether) to run all the amazing things decentralisation affords

that's so backward I'm speechless... trading in 'bonds' that appreciate over time for bonds that depreciate over time

i think this is something ethereum will allow very easily

But if demand for using it to fuel Dapps overtakes issuance, it'll increase in value.

is it irony that he's speaking at the ATM Industry Association annual conference:
@_date: 2014-01-16 17:37:12
totes agree, with CAD being devalued to the USD...
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:48:35
This is awesome
@_date: 2014-04-24 21:54:04
Everyone has had that experience.

sooo easy
@_date: 2015-01-20 09:34:56
it's also an adjective
@_date: 2015-01-11 23:26:50
ordered 6+ months ago, still don't have them. I don't know anyone else that got theirs

I was too for awhile. Then I started learning to code.

The costs are extremely low, less than 0.1 % in most cases; you can pay a higher transaction fee for a faster transaction (minutes), or no transaction fee for a slower transaction (up to an hour). Compare this to international wires or Western Union. All transactions are viewable instantly on the blockchain but confirmations are needed to prevent double spending - not a huge problem except maybe for micropayments, but many solutions exist for that.
Several business exist that help merchants with payment processing by immediately converting BTC to fiat, protecting the merchant from price swings. At most they charge 1%. Compare this to credit/debit card charges to merchants by the big players.

as mass adoption increases, market cap will increase. Along with this, large price swings will become less and less common/possible and hence, decreased volatility. With decreased volatility will come increased ability to predict BTC's increase in value (i.e. deflation). A quick look at a log chart should prove instructive.

I haven't laughed this hard reading comments on r/bitcoin ever. Thanks all.
@_date: 2013-12-28 20:10:57
yeah any merchant taking on the risk of a double spend accepting BTC for a 3 dollar cup of coffee makes up for it by not paying cc fees

if by stability you mean persistent devaluation, then yes, the dollar is stable
