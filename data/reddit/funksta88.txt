I was in the first 100 to sign up to this.  Got to the website and CoinJar makes you identify yourself with even more data. It seems like a full government checkup as they ask for your address if you moved within the past three years. 
Also had to input my drivers license number and expiry again.
I'm interested to see what the fees will be and how easy it is to use.

So is this a private company or colored coins in general?
Also, what will this type of colored coins do?
Anyway, here goes,

That is pretty awesome.  It is good to see that some ends are being tied up to create a closed circuit.

There is little reason for people to buy bitcoin to pay for bills this way.  It just gives another option for people already invested.  Perhaps it might come in handy for bitcoiners travelling to Australia that require medical attention not covered directly by travel insurance.  As they aren't australian citizens then they are not entitled to free medical appointments.
I think you just misunderstood what I wrote about conversations with non-bitcoiners.  I was suggesting that people who generally do not understand bitcoin or are generally negative towards bitcoin tend to point out how nothing can be done with a digital currency.  The best way I know how to prove this theory wrong is by telling them how I have paid for bills.  I don't expect them to go out and by bitcoins on this alone, I just want them to understand there are more options nowadays.

I'm waiting for confirmation now. They said it should take about 5-7 days before I actually receive the card.  It is weird that I had to go through an extra identification process as I had already sent them the same info so I could buy and sell.
This is a screenshot of what I see when I log on. I blacked out my number in the queue as I'm not sure if it could lead to something.

I used this site to pay off my girlfriends medical bills.  Easiest bill I have manually paid for.  It also helps when people tell me that nothing can be paid for with bitcoins and I can say any bill I get can be paid with bitcoin.

And so far I am really enjoying this rollercoaster.  I will be riding this until it dies (if it does).

It's good to see my home town start to embrace bitcoin.  Had a lunch barbie today and had people asking me about it.  The most interested person was running a rental business and was asking a lot of questions on it with about 11 other people listening in.  I'll be off the the cafe tomorrow to check it out as it will be my first opportunity to buy something with bitcoin in the wild. I'm a little bit excited and my girlfriend is showing some interest now that bitcoins can be used for a couple everyday items around town.

Havelock divides 1 Share into 100 micro-shares.  Therefore 1 Share normally costing 2BTC is equal to 100 micro-shares at 0.02BTC.
1000 micro-shares (Havelock) is 10 Shares.

This effect looks like it has been produced by youtubes internal post-processing.  Any video can have the option extra stability at the cost of window size.  I think it works by zooming into the original video and taking points of interest and attempting to keep those points in the same coordinates.  Sometimes it works quite well and sometimes it makes the video look trippy.

Thanks for the heads up on Bittrade Australia.  I have been looking for the best way to take my btc out if I needed to.

What annoys me most is that I have sent documents away for verification and I have not been verified yet.  Therefore I cannot even choose to sell anything on the site and or transfer to another.

There is no Java Plug-in in my firefox to disable.  Still will not login.

Just to put in a little comment to possibly inform the title and comment scanners that exist on reddit.  (I am known to do that sometimes).  
The devices need to be accesable physically by the NSA.  This means someone at the NSA needs to actually have the phone in front of them, plugged into the computer, to install this software.  They are working on a remote version but for now, it is only a physical install similar to jailbreaking the phone.  This is suggested in the last paragraph of the image of NSAs DROPOUTJEEP.
This is also not just for the iPhone.  Quoting the article at around the 9^th paragraph: 




I am not a hater of any phone manufacturer.  I think it is good to have competition or we end up with lazy manufacturers with no substantial improvements in quality or ease of use.  If there is anything I have wrong about DROPOUTJEEP, please let me know.

Thanks.  It works now.
I guess you can try another post as well and double up on views if you want, but it doesn't matter to me either way.

At least this isn't just a one off case.  Maybe the site is just putting a pause on logins for a while to make sure they don't get taken down.

Similar thing happened to me.  Try this
Should have something to do with the new java update.

I have been using [coinjar.io](
Based in Melbourne and the owners frequent the Melbourne Bitcoin meetups.  Only a 2% fee when buying btc and it seems like they cover transfer fees when you move it to your personal wallet.  Starts off with a $100 limit per day everyday for a week then increases up to $500.  Every successful deposit after that will make your daily limit increase by $100 until a max of $5000.
So far so good with me.  Transferred about $2000 AUD so far and is cheaper and easier than anything else I have tried.
Currently, The price is 109.4747 at Coinjar but 110 at mtgox.  The price is usually around $2 give or take the mtgox price (not including 2% buy fee).
(I am not affiliated with Coinjar.io,  I just needed something easy, reliable, and cheap)

Thought I'd let you know that it requires a login to view the linked forum.

It is a fairly new site so the only option for selling btc is if you have a business.  I think it is setup similar to Bitpay where once an address receives btc, coinjar converts it to aud and transfers to a business bank account.  Coinjar might eventually open btc-aud transfers in the future but that really isn't my say.
did let me know about a website called [Bittrade Australia]( that does btc-aud bank transfers but I haven't used that yet.
