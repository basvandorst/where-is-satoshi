I am the lead moderator of - I started that subreddit over 3 years ago and have been following it almost daily ever since.
Nevermind the fact that you are not entitled to a refund and agreed to that when purchasing the Neptune pre-order... That statement you just wrote makes no sense whatsoever considering their previous refund practices.
KncMiner does not care what the value of BTC is when processing a refund, because they only pay back fair market value in fiat. In case, he was granted 42 BTC in refunds after he had paid 20 BTC to KncMiner when the price was higher and that was only 1 month ago.
See here: 
The only way they would be doing that (refunding double the amount in BTC) would be if they cashed out the BTC immediately upon receipt of it (this is the only sane thing for any company investing millions of dollars in hardware can do) and were now buying back BTC to send the client their refund... which fortunately in case ended up making him a 22 BTC profit!
Had BTC doubled in price since made his purchase, he probably would have received just 10 BTC back instead of 42 BTC. Which would be fair market value in fiat for what he paid.
According to KncMiner's terms and conditions posted publicly on their website: 
They make no mention that anybody is entitled a refund, ever.
In fact, on all of the neptune order pages they claim that: **"This purchase is non-refundable"**
Maybe you should have done some research and hung out in for a bit before plunging $6,000 down on a pre-order? The general rule of thumb is "pre-orders almost always screw you".
You gave KncMiner your money for a product they had not even proven to exist yet, now sit back and hope that it comes ASAP.
Buyer beware.
***EDIT: If anybody has proof that they were promised a refund and never received one, please let me know and I will sticky a thread to warning others to stay away!***

Yea, like I said, I created it over 3 years ago and have been watching it almost daily.
There isn't a single complaint about kncminer not honoring refunds or acting horrible as you have mentioned. Besides the fact that they shipped some units a few months ago with poor packaging. See here: 
It bothers me to see one person trying so hard to give a relatively fair company a bad name.

Fair enough, I did not check KncMiner's page every day.
Anyways, anybody with that fully-refundable purchase has been refunded that I am aware of.
In fact, if you'll search on our subreddit, nobody is crying foul about kncminer not honoring refunds they were promised. Nobody.


As for that comment, I don't know what to say. I was not aware of KncMiner screwing large numbers of people over intentionally. The difficulty has shot up rather quickly recently, and they were slow to deliver, sure. But they're not doing anything they don't claim to be doing as far as I know.

Writing your own customized implementation of [bitcoinj]( or [btcd]( perhaps? Writing your own wallet software would be best.
It shouldn't be tough for a competantly funded exchange.
And we have known about "the malleability issue" since the inception of Bitcoin. It has been publicly viewable on the official bitcoin wiki for over a year: 
@_date: 2014-02-11 23:48:59

It is fairly irresponsible of bitstamp to be relying on the original bitcoind "satoshi client" wallet as their main wallet for an entire exchange however, from what I understand.
@_date: 2014-01-15 04:15:45
I'm sorry, but how could they make $1M by 51ing Namecoin? Care to explain?
By the time they double-spent $500k to two exchanges and exchanged for bitcoin/fiat... the price would have dropped to 0.00000001 NMC/BTC and presumably many flags would go off on the exchanges, halting their withdrawal of the Bitcoin value.
If they performed a double spend attack against Bitcoin, their results would certainly be $0 gained. It takes manual verification to send out large fiat withdrawals from any exchange. If you tried to cashout $10M+ of double-spent Bitcoin, the exchanges would most certainly catch the fraud in the act before they cashed out the money.
All in all, they would be risking jail time and their (incredibly profitable) business reputation for what would most likely be a $0 gain.
@_date: 2014-02-12 00:23:24
You certainly did.
To clarify, building a properly functioning vault around a leather wallet is a perfectly valid course of action for a bank.
Using just the leather wallet however, would not suffice.
The above analogy is what bitstamp claims to be doing at the moment.
@_date: 2014-01-15 04:26:14


I added that bit in shortly after... you probably didn't read it.
Try to think of how it would go down? How exactly would they extract anything from a 51% on Bitcoin?
imho they would have a better chance 51%ing namecoin, only because they could *possibly* immediately cash out their double-spent namecoins in bitcoin.
And no, they wouldn't indict somebody for a 51% attack specifically. But they would surely indict somebody who fraudulantly deposited $10M+ to multiple exchanges, and defrauded other people under their governement control in the process.

Quite honestly this reads like you have some sort of financial incentive to promote the vault of satoshi.
I have been a customer of cavirtex since almost day one and I am hugely appreciative of the risk they took setting up their company years ago.
If I had a large amount of BTC to withdraw right now, I would certainly trust the company that has been around for literally tens if not hundreds of times longer than the other two companies you mentioned. No matter what fees they charge. Which are actually only 1.5% max and as low as 0.5%

If they're interested I might mention a few other stores that I know accept it locally, but that's it.
I never try to impose Bitcoin on anybody. Just mentioning it in passing seems to spark a lot of interest though it seems.

As far as we (the core namecoin supporters) can tell he is not associated with the namecoin project whatsoever. He runs an unfactual facebook page that he promotets wildly and is unwilling to edit any of it to make it factual. He cares much more about sensationalism than facts or the real truths of namecoin unfortunately.

The mining farm, I'll agree, is incredibly controversial.
Nobody really wants to see centralized mining. The recent GHash debaucle really emphasized that.
Fortunately for my argument's sake, that has nothing to do with their not performing refunds which they promised they would after a certain date or what not.

You're correct about what you're talking about.
But that's not what I'm talking about.
All I am saying is if you put a $10 bill in your pocket in January of 2000 that it would have the equivalent buying power of $1.54 today.
If there was 1 of something. And the next day there was 10 of something. That original 1 of something is inherently worth 10 times less. I don't care what google fu you think you have.
If they print more money, it makes the dollar bills in your pocket right now less valuable. Prove me wrong on that, which is all I am trying to say.

After reading this, I think I know where a surprise $60 overage bandwidth bill came from early this year.
I am usually pretty cautious when it comes to downloading and going over my limit. I have neve received a bandwidth overage charge until early this year, and was completely confused as to how or why, but my router was showing massive usage during the same month so I paid those fuckers their ransom on my internet freedom.
I was loading the bitcoin blockchain from scratch onto a USB for myself and a friend, and because of the slow disk speed on the USB the client was left open and running for a week or two. That must have translated into a few hundred extra GB of network usage that caused my ISP to send me a $60 overage bill.
**Not good.**

Remember, you can only do it once and must cashout immediately, after that the coin is nearly worthless.
It's not possible to secretly double-spend some coins to a bitcoin address you can hold on to until later when things calm down. Once a massive double spend occurs, everybody will know about it once you stop propping up the blockchain with your fake data.

Read the title again. The parentheses imply PayPal technically allows (and protects) the sale of digital goods. Which they do.
The problem is that buyers lie, and PayPal doesn't have a special sale button that is only for intangible goods.
If the buyer says "I bought intangible goods (ie bitcoins) but did not receive them" then PayPal does not issue a chargeback, as is company policy.
If only PayPal would implement a "intangible=0/1" value into their payment buttons (and warn buyers that they were purchasing a non-refundable, intangible good)... but that will never happen imho.

What? If you sell intangible items, and the buyer admits that they bought intagible items, then you are free from any kind of paypal chargeback whatsoever. Period.

Your programmer argument is... interesting at best.
PayPal does have it's advantages over bitcoin in that situation, by far. If the programmer doesn't produce what I have asked, I do not have to be out of any money. However, if I paid the programmer first with bitcoin, and later found out they were unable to complete the work as promised (which happens quite a bit in freelance programming imho) then I would be out of my entire payment. Lots of programmers accept PayPal as a payment method. It's a means of telling the programmer basically "I have money, and here you go, but if you don't do the proper job, I can revoke it."
I love bitcoin, but your argument is flawed.
I have paid freelance programmers via PayPal many times and am glad that I have done so, mainly because most freelance programmers (on sites like elance) are scammers, and promise you the world when they are literally just learning.

I understand that they are unwilling to pay back the stolen bitcoins, which is angering to the bitcoin community...
But the REAL REASON you should not use linode is this:
It was THEIR OWN SOFTWARE that was COMPRIMISED! There was virtually nothing more the bitcoin pool operators could have done besides implement tighter verification techniques...
Linode messed up, not the BTC holders.
I wonder how many other linode hosting accounts have been sniffed through using the exact same technique? Probably thousands if not hundreds of thousands. And no, I'm not exaggerating.

It's not that... PayPal has no problem with bitcoin whatsoever. They still allow listings for it on eBay, so there is proof of it right there.
The problem with PayPal is that it is so easy for a customer to force their payment back, it's not worth it.
PayPal is simply another possible "chargeback layer" that a seller has to deal with.
Once you have sold bitcoins through PayPal, now the buyer can either call their credit card company OR call paypal and get the money reversed almost instantly because you do not have a tracking number.
@_date: 2012-06-22 17:29:49

P.S. torrent sites hardly make a big profit. Haven't you noticed the plethora of crappy adverts on them? They can only host with 2nd and 3rd tier advertising companies because most reputable ones won't touch them. Most torrent site ops are not doing it for the money.

What the hell kind of a "freelance programmer" keeps 3,000+ bitcoins stored on a shared hosting environment?
That's just stupidity.
Buy a $2 USB and put it in your pocket.
EDIT: To be fair, apparently $15k was what he was willing to risk, and he was well aware of that fact... still stupid if you ask me.
EDIT 2: No, this is ridiculous. Apparently he kept the bitcoins on the same server he kept his website on. Stupid, stupid stupid stupid. He could have "insured" himself for $10/month by paying AWS ec2 for a "small" instance to host the bitcoin wallet, and verified every call made from linode.com to the ec2 box. That, or been an actual business man and taken 2 seconds of his time to verify transactions over $1,000 or whatever... I guess he just liked the idea of a 100% automated/hands-free money maker of a website. Too bad those don't exist.

Notable fixes in v0.3.24, and the main reasons for this release:
F1) Block downloads were failing or taking unreasonable amounts of time to complete, because the increased size of the block chain was bumping up against some earlier buffer-size DoS limits.
F2) Fix crash caused by loss/lack of network connection.
Notable changes in v0.3.24:
C1) DNS seeding enabled by default.
C2) UPNP enabled by default in the GUI client.  The percentage of bitcoin clients that accept incoming connections is quite small, and that is a problem.  This should help.  bitcoind, and unofficial builds, are unchanged (though we encourage use of "-upnp" to help the network!)
C3) Initial unit testing framework.  Bitcoin sorely needs automated tests, and this is a beginning.  Contributions welcome.
C4) Internal wallet code cleanup.  While invisible to an end user, this change provides the basis for v0.4's wallet encryption.
TL;DR no wallet encryption as promised :S

1) You can run 4*5830s with an $80 1000W PSU. I am doing it right now.
2) Your HDD is worthless in terms of bitcoin mining. Any real miner uses linux which can be run off of a $5 USB drive. Same goes for the "monitor plug cable shorters" you have that are a windows-only requirement.
Ok so we are up to $880 then total brand new cost. That is actually closer to what I paid. I tend to exaggerate ;)
I am being serious. I will offer you 50% of what you paid for your rig. So $440 USD.

You will get at *least* 10% below the lowest possible retail price for everything just to start off guaranteed. eBay and PayPal will take a further 25% off in terms of listing fees, final value fees, and paypal fees. So we're already down to 70 cents on the dollar in terms of what you could get back if you sold it through eBay.
Anyways I am not trying to bash you, just love talking numbers. And love mining ;)

mtgox now has a contact message system on the right side of their homepage. Send them a message and report back what they suggest.
Currently MtGox and/or tradehill are probably your best bets.
Buying bitcoins is currently pretty difficult which stinks, I know. But look at the massive demand for them there is already... and what a pain it is to buy them. If I were you I would go and buy the money order today and just say "screw it!".
You are not the only one who has to wait 7 days to get their money into the market though don't worry.

Do you mean... would Bitcoin work if the "problems" we had to solve were humanitarian rather than mathematical in nature?
No, unfortunately it would not. We have to be solving increasingly difficult problems at a very specific rate and cannot rely on any external sources to input the data.
On the same topic... I was wondering if somebody with the skills coded a protein folding application that combined with a bitcoin miner (mine 95% bitcoins and 5% protein folding or whatever ratio the miner desires)... I would definitely use that mining software.
@_date: 2011-06-09 00:36:29
The only solution in my eyes would be to accept credit cards/paypal but force their funds to "mature" for 180 days to ensure they are non-reversible in order to begin making transactions.
This is mush tougher to do and more costly to both parties than the current setup however.
@_date: 2011-09-01 00:56:25

Somebody mentioned this idea a few weeks ago. I suggested that we wait until we have at least 10,000 redditors on r/Bitcoin and also a popular thread dedicating our devotion to wanting to pay reddit for gold in bitcoins.
The fact that the transaction is such a small one, they would probably welcome bitcoin payments in to the mix. Since we would be saving them roughly $0.50 per transaction in terms of fees. That's one eighth of their total price!

@_date: 2011-07-13 15:55:34
Wait, soooo... they just encrypt your wallet and you have to type a password each time to un-encrypt it.
This will only prevent people like your siblings/spouse from stealing your bitcoins.
If you ever get a trojan on your computer (which is why everybody was shouting for encryption in the first place I thought, because viruses are damned frightening to the non-technologically-minded individual) then your bitcoins will be gone the second you type in that password and the keylogger jacks it.
Let's not delve into security theater here people...
A simple warning flag that checks MS windows for non-existant or non-updated virus checkers is all we need. And will probably do much more than what this encryption ever will.
**TL;DR If the computer gets infected, your money is still gone, simple as that.**
Edit: Don't get me wrong. Added security is added security. I appreciate TheBlueMatt's addition to the software. But I just hope you all understand exactly what you're getting. And that it isn't foolproof.

Pretty awesome idea!
I can only think of one fault...
Say the thief of your password card KNEW that you had it for your bitcoin wallet - he had hacked into your computer months ago and was unable to crack it... now he hunts you down and threatens you for your password... you say you can't remember it because you're too afraid but it's on your passwordcard that you keep in your wallet.
Now all the hacker has to do is attempt any one of the say 25,000 possible passwords encoded on the password card and he's in.
Or perhaps your "friend" who you introduced to bitcoin and the passwordcard decides he's not so friendly anymore. Again he only must try ~25,000 passwords in order to get in.

I do think that I should have spent at least 25% of the $3k I was willing to lose purely on bitcoins however. That is my one regret. I would have well over 1,000 BTC if I had done so.

Paxum is a canadian company. You need simply contact your local bank, get the appropriate transit/institution numbers/etc... and allow paxum to verifiy your account/identity. This is pretty standard for online payment processors in Canada, and you only need to do it once.
It's not quick, but relatively painless. I have had a few friends purchase some already using this method. Let us know how it goes?!

The micro-payment possibilities of bitcion (with low fees) will be attractive to the online pornographic industry.
Right now whenever some pervert uploads $5 to a cam/chat website - the banks eat $1-$2 of that original $5.

The other reason people feel safe storing their money in a bank... is because their parents did so all of their life and there has never been a problem.

If they are simply small batches...
1. Create a new "address" every time an order page is created.
2. Save the order to a "pending payments" database.
3. When bitcoins are received at the new address created in step 1, ship the client's order.

For $150, you will get a 5830, that will mine about 300mhash/s, and will make you ~5.16 coins per month at the current difficulty or about $45 USD worth at the current exchange rate.
If you believe bitcoins will be worth $1,000 each in 10 years, that's a great investment. If you think they'll be worth $10 in 10 years, maybe not.

I was thinking this the other night... and it is a very plausible idea.
All the owners must do is say "whoops, sorry, the 'security auditor' who was some guy off of freelance.com made off with the bitcoins, we don't know anything about him or there wherabouts".
That is the beauty of bitcoin. Nobody can prove that MtGox is still the owner of them.
They probably will never make 400,000+ BTC - and with all of the resentment towards them, they may just decide to do so.
I honestly believe they are coming back online soon however and all of this is simply crazy conspiracy theories.
They would be making a tough life for themselves indeed if they tried to run.

Yes it is! (Just added that to the OP, thanks!)
And no, you would not have to re-join the wallet.dat every time you accepted a payment.
You would only re-join the wallet.dat file when you wanted to spend money from it. Simply join it and drop into your bitcoin client's folder (wherever that may be on your OS).
This technique is best reserved for your "life savings" of bitcoins, rather than your regular spending wallet.

1. Considering 6950s are about 3x cheaper (through newegg) than a 6990 and they are "unlockable" to a 6970 that can do 420mhashes... or about 50% speed of the 6990s... it would be more economical to buy 2X6950s and you would receive the same result in terms of speed. If you have to pay for electricity however, you will spend more using 2 cards instead of 1.

I must admit, when Bruce was the LOUDEST mouth running around screaming "SOMEBODY CALL THE FBI! SOMEBODY CALL THE POLICE! CALL YOUR SENATORS! BLAH BLAH BLAH!" and nobody else seemed to really care... that made me think he was behind the entire thing right there.
He was overtly trying to distance himself from something he didn't really have any business distancing himself from.
So he promoted mybitcoin on his tv show? So what? He was not doling out financial advice, it's not like you can hold him accountable for any suggestions he gave out.

The fact that I (or the seller) can extract the worth of the coin after they transfer it to someone is ridiculous.

You should be good at 1000W.
3*5850 = 450 watts stock + 70 watts (20%) due to power inefficiency = 520 watts total.
Your CPU will use around 50 watts of electricity. Which means your PSU would be running at approximately 57% which is considered safe for 24/7 operation.
If you only bought a 600W powersupply for example... it will work at 100% load, but expect it to break much *MUCH* faster.

Sure, but can you remember that password in your brain? I can't. And I don't trust leaving it on my computer somewhere or written down for anyone to see.
Also, the attacker would have to first try all single words, all double words, all triple word phrases, all quintuple word phrases, and all sextuple word phrases before he found a match. So the difficulty is slightly above 10^12... Also there are over 150k english words in current use... so if you wanted to get a bit more creative, something like:
i crave bitcoin cash in my stupendously large wallet
then the proability of cracking it would be in the range of 150k^9 = 1 in 3.84433594e46 tries.
I am not saying I have the safest password in the world, but I am saying you can create incredibly strong passwords with nothing more than everyday english words you can easily remember.

Just get it into mtgox by any means necessary asap.
If you just discovered bitcoins you shouldn't be jumping into the market anyways.
If you are serious about bitcoins you should have already had funds waiting to purchase them inside mtgox.

You are asking the question on reddit..? What kind of answer do you think you will receive?
In all seriousness though, I read and participate in both. They are two great communities in their own ways.
It depends on the question I suppose. If I had a question about mining in particular, I would address the mining sub forum and get a knowledgeable answer within a few minutes usually.
If I had a hurr-durr thought about bitcoin or an up and coming site to tell the bitcoin world about, I would probably post on reddit.

Every new miner = at least 5 new bitcoin users in my mind.

We still need the difficulty of the network to increase in order to make it more secure too.

That forum provides next to no protection against automated spam bot signups. I suspect the steady rise is mainly due to those types of "members".

For an extremely small mining setup, the largest possible pool would be best imho (deepbit.net). Since you don't want to risk your miner running for 4-5 hours without finding a block.
@_date: 2011-04-20 03:06:28
Why don't you simply download the bitcoin program and test it out?
Once you have received an average hash rate from the program, you can insert that into the [bitcoin calculator]( and determine how long on average it should take you to find one block of 50 BTC.
Probably a few years I am guessing.

Or, let's not and save ourselves the embarrassment.
Bitcoin is not ready to be adopted by Reddit.
Why on earth would Reddit take a chance on Bitcoin, when we have just recently (~6 months ago, re: MtGocalypse) proven quite publicly that our community is not capable or warranted of handling any level of significant business?
The value of bitcoins to USD has been continually depleting since the MtGox fiasco because ***nobody has contributed anything worthwhile to the community since that time***. Things have only been getting worse for our cause and situation.
How ridiculously stupid would it be for Reddit to take a chance on us at this point in time? They are at the top of their game, have you seen their recent explosion of growth?
If you don't like what I just wrote, why not try changing something about this current (horrid) situation, instead of simply clicking the downvote button and jumping back into your alternate reality?

I would give it 6 months and I expect to see some serious competition to mtgox.

Because it's "the people's project", everybody is afraid to play moderator.
It is quite obvious (especially to the older folk) who is trolling.
Those people should be banned from the forum indefinitely (as they are in basically every other forum on the net, for purposely stirring shit up) but they are left to wreak havoc as they please because the community is so "anarchic" by nature.
They are "strong enough" to move the forums to another domain, but too weak to ban a few troublemakers? I don't understand.
That's why I stick to reddit ;) The chaff is automatically filtered for you.
**EDIT: For starters, why don't they list every user's ip address along with their usernames? This would cause an uproar (and mass banning, hopefully) once they realized that 50% of the accounts on there are sock puppets.**

MtGox is now one of the largest bitcoin currency exchanges on the internet. Moving upwards of $20M USD/month in currency.

Seems to be the most "psychologically-acceptable" answer they could come up with. But still doesn't make much sense.
A reader's thought process...
1. (good) "independent auditing, wow that's responsible"
2. (bad) "oh it was just a simple computer hack, makes sense"
3. (good) "site was not hacked, awesome"
Who the FUCK hires an auditor that can't even secure their own computer from being "compromised"???

You mean to and from other addresses? I am not sure that the bitcoind client has that functionality built into it.
I believe blockexplorer.com downloads the block data themselves and then creates their own html graphs with cusomized code. Hence why there are no alternatives to blockexplorer. Not really at least.

WTF does this have to do with bitcoin?
Nobody holds onto 1 dollar bills for 2 years.
Most people don't hold onto 100 dollar bills for more than 3 seconds.
Either way, that doesn't mean that they "expire" or anything... you can send a ripped, shredded bill into your local bank and they will replace it for you, free of charge.

It's a great effort and I commend them for it. However when I play poker for real money, especially at the stakes I like to pay at, I don't fuck around when it comes to all around quality of the site. I was playing one ring game for example and was refused to "leave" the game some how due to a glitch in the system.
I was stuck paying blinds at a table while some jackass of a bot waited exactly 3 minutes (the maximum allowed time) for every single hand. It was horrendous! Why are you allowed 3 minutes to make a decision anyways? Most of the "big boys" only allow 10-30 seconds max.

One thing I learnt before I was a developer was this: most of your ideas are probably not feasible.
Unless you actually know how to program, lots of the "great ideas for programming" you might have will be difficult if not impossible to enact.
For example... betfair doesn't just have some algorithm that knows when every sporting even in the world takes place... they pay hundreds of people to collect that information, verify it, and re-verify it.
It took millions of dollars to create betfair.com - when you have the idea AND millions of dollars to waste on R&amp;D... then come and talk to me ;)

In actuality, I spent $3k for 300 BTC (assuming I will recoup $7k by selling all my equipment) - which is about $10 each or about 3x less than they are currently trading for - so I didn't make out too horribly.
Sure, had I have invested every penny I could get my hands on when bitcoins were at $0.70 when I first found them... I'd be fucking rich - but I'd also be fucking crazy insane to do so (and would never have saved $10k in the first place if that's how I acted in general).

I don't believe THIS (textcoin) will really open the market... but innovation is always a good thing.
The fees associated with textcoin are roughly 20% so not many people would be buying many bitcoins via that route.
It's not the owner's fault, either. SMS payments are a ridiculous scam setup by the cell phone companies. (In north america/europe at least).
They will all charge you around 20-30% fees in order to transfer the cash. Some fees I have seen as high as 40%.

That's a pretty roundabout way to go about buying bitcoins.
*"So let me get this straight, I have to drive to my bank, purchase rolls of quarters, and then drive to this machine that will take 5% and give me a Qr code on it?"*
Because really, who has that much change lying around their homes anymore.
With so many banks these days offering free coin counting services, anyone who ever had a significant amount of change in the past does not any longer.
And then what do you do when the machine you have sitting there gets robbed of it's fiat currency, and you have already give out the bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-15 20:47:25
edit: this is not an endorsement of their services, I only know that they exist, I have never used them.

And bitcoin store will get proportionately less sales because of that lack of consumer protection if you think about it...
There is a reason people whip out their credit cards willy nilly for any purchase, it's because people think they're "protected" buying with a credit card, and they are.

Have you seen the screenshots of overlapping buy and sell orders being shown at once on the same page? I would never deposit anything in that exchange.
@_date: 2013-07-05 03:56:34
How does that even relate?
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:34:11
I came here to say the same.
When you charge a 0% commission for trading, that entire 76% could be created by one man. Buying and selling his own Bitcoin for his own Fiat millions of times over... and then paying the small percentage to cash out once he's had his fun.
@_date: 2013-03-07 17:45:45
Is this why I can't send transactions a lot of the time anymore?
I won some satoshidice bets... now whenever I try to send bitcoins to somebody using bitcoind it's a 50/50 chance I'll get a "create transaction FAILED" message.

I'm just going to point out from a business perspective why **this request will not happen until the bitcoin value stabilizes much more.**
If I give you a 3% discount right now for buying my product in bitcoins... I am taking a risk that those bitcoins might be worth less when I go to cash them in for USD (which I need to do immediately to pay my suppliers tomorrow when they come with more product, unfortunately).
There are sites like japanbit.com yes, who charge [2X what a candy costs anywhere else (that's 2 pounds of pocky for ~$15, not including shipping)]( and give you a 3% discount for paying in bitcoins... OK... so you get a 3% discount on a 100% premium?
The truth is japanbit (or any business you want to last more than a few days) must operate in this way, lest they be subject to bankruptcy at any moment.

The blogger who wrote the medium.com article is quite good. It's not even his real blog, he just made it for that one post, so he's not link-whoring or anything. I don't even think he's using his real name.
According to the article...






@_date: 2013-12-16 04:38:46
We don't need regulation. And there already is real legal accountability. The problem is that most of the exchanges that have lost investors funds have been in "offshore" countries that typically don't have many laws.
If a BTC exchange in North America or Europe was responsible for losing $1M+ of investor funds, there would be hell to pay.

That's probably the best way, posting some type of verifiable proof on both exchanges.
@_date: 2013-10-15 21:08:38
It's not a good thing, but I wouldn't call it a fatal flaw...
Within hours of libcoin (somewhat) responsibly disclosing the vulnerability to the namecoin core devs... there are already bounties and bugfixes in the works to get this problem straightened out: (see here  )
The only lasting effect of this programming oversight is that two domains have been "stolen" by the user libcoin in an effort to prove to the dev-team that the vulnerability exists. Those domains are d/bitcoin and d/wav as far as I know.
The "attacker" has identified himself as ["Michael Gronager, Chief Operation Officer at Payward Inc - the kraken.com exchange"]( and seems more than helpful in providing help to the dev team.
Nobody besides libcoin has the code to steal domain name registrations.
Nobody has ever stolen a domain name prior to a few hundred blocks ago.
The fixes are already in the works: 
Again, I would hardly call this a "fatal flaw".

Satoshi dice could never have a single bet against them be a "double spend" that amounted in their losing anything.
The reason why is that they include small original bet in the "win payout" payment sent back to you.
If the original bet is deemed a double spend by the bitcoin community at large, then the payout value will never be validated in the scammer's bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2013-04-17 15:39:51

I was sarcastically saying you might want to remove that one line from your homepage. It doesn't exactly instill confidence in the end user.
You don't show up to a street fight with your tail between your legs.
Tell customers to be cautious and remind them that it's in BETA, but you don't need to tell them exactly why.
Basically the information you're transmitting to the customer is "this is a crypto powered exchange website... I think... I am not sure... I just learnt the word 'crypto' the other day, neat don't you think?"

Can you re-send them to that address? Perhaps re-initiate the same transaction that took place originally, once you have assumed ownership of that address?
Imo you're probably screwed unfortunately. Even if you could recover them, the coinbase rep who received your request for help has probably already done so by now.
