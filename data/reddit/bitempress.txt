As I read and understood from earlier post: 2x does not equal 2mb. 2x equals like 8mb.  Larger blocks centralize bandwidth. The last fork already increased mb.

It’s ridiculous to think I can get taxed for trading between coin on unrealized gains. I’m holding for a few more years, could be zero by then.

Thank you for response. So from what ive been following,  if wallet providers and exchanges (more if them) convert to segregated witness we will have SW PLUS around 4mb which should be good for now and no need for next hard fork. This needs to be posted everyday for newbies like me to understand their investment.

It’s called fractional reserve banking. You need to do some studying up on banking/financial/monetary system. It’s 101 stuff.

Exactly. Stop feeding the Jamie Dimon bullshit. The media is eating it up and it’s not the kind of exposure we need. Stop poking the criminal bear. Why? The media eats every word he says and encourages it. Fuck him... let it go. Ignore Jayme Dimon!!!
