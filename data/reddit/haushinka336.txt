How do you suggest I get BTC for my wallet? I don't want to mine and I don't have $600 to buy one. And, I don't want to strip in front of the camera just to have one. I just wanna have even a Satoshi in my wallet.

You got that right! Mabu-hello back at yah!
@_date: 2014-02-24 03:54:08
True that!
@_date: 2014-02-24 07:30:25
well, that's not impossible. :-P

i don't know the implications if bitcoin reaches $11. It could mean a lot of things, but if ever it does, i'd sure buy a lot of it, too.

haha.. actually, when I was about to eat my breakfast in the same village market (there were tables set aside if you wanna eat), there was this girl who was talking about bitcoin to a stranger. it was like a bitcoin epiphany weekend for me, but i got too shy to talk to her.
@_date: 2014-02-14 07:53:32
i don't think so. There could be a lot of factors as to why it reached that amount.

I totally agree with you, and if you read his board in detail, he is also offering applewood bacon, that's what I bought from him anyway. Actually, if you convert it to USD, it's $21 per kilo. I don't know if that's cheap or expensive in the US, but it's organic. 
And yeah, pastrami is hard to come by around here, and if you want GOOD pastrami, its already an indulgence.

So, I went to the weekend market in our village last Saturday and to my surprise, I saw this stall accepting bitcoin! I wasn't supposed to buy from them but I did, but not with Bitcoin of course because I wasn't expecting anyone to do it in the weekend market, but lo and behold! I told the guy that next time, I'd buy his pastrami sandwich using my BTC. I cant wait for the weekend!

IN Salcedo Saturday Market

Oh, I've heard about buybitcoin.ph but I haven't done any transaction with them yet; but I've been to their website and I think it's pretty cool. Its just that for Filipinos, P24,000 is too much for a  digital currency that they haven't heard of. But I am definitely open to try out their services.
And just in case you're around that area, the stall is at the left when you enter from the Salcedo Towers condo. Good luck and I think the owner will really appreciate the transaction; I don't think he had a BTC transaction yet. Im planning to be his first, but if you beat me to it, no worries. :-)

well, it applies to me.

You can buy buy real milk everyday in my village, I just don't think that the vendor sells it using bitcoin. :-P
@_date: 2014-02-14 07:52:48
I agree with you, and I hope that a lot of people would also invest on it rather than treat it as a commodity. I also hope that more businesses will accept it so that when it hits this price, we can use it more often. But then again, you'd want to keep it for yourself until it reaches a high prize again, right?
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:00:58
It's OK, I'm not usually in the weekend market anyway, but let's see. Oh, it's only 1000 php? I didn't know that. I haven't totally explored BTC in the Philippines, but thanks for the heads up. Now that I know about this, I think I might buy some from buybitcoin. Walang anuman!
@_date: 2014-02-13 10:36:06
What can I do/buy with a Satoshi?
@_date: 2014-02-13 10:36:57
Oh thanks.. Didn't read it. Too excited to post this story but thanks anyway. I just hope that they don't remove my original post.
@_date: 2014-02-24 11:28:50
wow.. that's fascinating. I live in Manila and I know less than 20 people who have heard about bitcoin. :-( 
@_date: 2014-02-14 08:00:04
I know that it's not Ponzi scheme, but not all bitcoin enthusiast have at least $700 to buy even just one at this time.
@_date: 2014-02-24 07:32:34
Because I didn't expect that someone from our village weekend market will accept bitcoin, knowing that we are a developing country. And for someone who writes daily about bitcoin and the fact that only less than 1% of out popular knows about bitcoin, that's pretty much an OMG moment for me.
@_date: 2014-02-13 09:39:13
Really? Thanks for the heads up. Does this rule only apply in Reddit or in general? If this is the case, it's OK. I was just trying it out anyway. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 01:59:06
it's not actually, its just a small food stall in our village and it certainly doesn't have that Silicon Valley vibe. :-)
@_date: 2014-02-24 03:59:00
Hey, pastrami is food. Food is essential to man.
