“At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.”   – 2008. – URL.
“At equilibrium size, many nodes will be server farms with one or two network nodes that feed the rest of the farm over a LAN.” – 2010. – URL.
“The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don’t generate.” – 2010. – URL.

Point being that, it's not what you see, but what you don't see that is happening as a side effect.  It's difficult to measure.  Everyone has a breaking point where a gallon of milk is not worth it to them to buy.  Same with on chain transactions.  Their utility is not infinite, there are options.  You will never see bitcoin transaction fees rise out of control or blocks be constantly full for this very reason.  Our only evidence that we are out of capacity is when growth slows or stops.  Where we are now, growth cannot occur as most seats on the bus are taken and the marginal few left will go at too high a price or too long to confirm.  We need to capture as much business as we can, otherwise we are squandering our first mover advantage and network effect.

so while in general, yes a webwallet could be considered bad practice.  It also comes with huge ease of use benefits.  That coupled with multisignature so that they cannot steal funds nor could a hacker steal your funds makes it quite safer than them simply being the custodian of your funds.   Not to mention that Coinbase is insured.
@_date: 2015-12-29 02:15:46
Bumpy indeed.  I'd rather see a hard fork increase to 2MB.  It's less risky in my view than a soft fork that completely rearranges how blocks are stored and verified and relies on not only nodes, but wallet providers implementing new software to take advantage of.  It would at least give us some breathing room.  I somewhat understand their aversion to hard forks, but their thinking that EVERYONE (including some shmo who installed v9 bitcoin years back and just left it on and forgot about it needs to upgrade is kinda crazy.  We can't let the lowest common denominator determine our fate.  It might as well be a 5% can override 95% at that point.
@_date: 2015-12-16 04:52:58
Another thing I have done, is if after giving the first explanation and they want further explanation is to give them link resources to read up on it.  Something to the tune of "I can explain it, but I think you would better understand it if you looked at these xx resources.  If you have more questions I would be happy to answer".
Effectively it puts the onus on them, if they come back and ask questions then you know they have put in the work to at least try to understand it.  If they ever say its so confusing I usually ask them a question "Could you explain technically how the FED works?  Or a credit card transaction works?  Or an ACH or Wire Transfer?"  Not easy is it?"

That's the thing though, bitcoin demand is not perfectly inelastic, users are not going to continue to use the chain if they can't reliably get recorded for a given fee.  There are fee threshholds that particular users/businesses will be forced to abandon their particular strategy and seek other alternatives.  So saying fees are not out of control and blocks aren't full all the time is not equivalent to saying the network is not at full capacity.  A common strategy for capacity planning is handling 1.5x -2.5x peak/average demand.  We aren't anywhere close to that.

I don't buy into this rewriting of history that somehow nodes have some play in economic majority for consensus (they do help with propogation).  They don't, nodes provide validation for the user or group that control them.  Anyone else relying on what another node says is not independently verifying.
Another thing I don't buy into is planning on miners colluding beyond the 50% threshhold.  Bitcoin is built on the predication that the majority of hashpower is "good".  If that goes out the window then all is lost anyways.
Lastly I would say it forced the bits to be set to prevent that miner from forking off when it is observed to be enforced.  I would say that's a helpful thing to a node/miner.

Many yes, majority?  I don't think so.  I could make the case that many are also extremely uninformed of the dangers of not increasing the blocksize in the face of subsidy drops putting the security of all bitcoin in danger. I really don't think the views of large blockers are majority uninformed, nor do I believe that for the small blockers.  I think the essences of both sides of the argument have for the most part risen above the noise.

So we need a block size that meets the lowest common denominator even if that denominator is the Chinese government restricting downloads?  Isn't this handing over power to them?

@_date: 2015-12-21 05:15:59


There is a realization that a restricted blocksize leads to higher fees.  All things being equal, would you prefer a 1MB blockchain with X fees or a 2MB blockchain with X/2 fees?  The point being that a restricted blocksize means you are effectively pricing someone out actually using bitcoin.  If there is more demand for on chain than is allowed by rule, then by rule someone is going to be a winner and someone a loser.  A point will be reached where someone will no longer value using bitcoin as it will be more useful for them to use the traditional payment rails.  The developers somehow believe it is the duty of the software to impose this specific economy for on chain transactions rather than leaving it to the miners which I think is seriously misguided.  The proponents of larger blocksizes see tremendous value in NOT pricing out individuals or entities from using bitcoin as we will ALL benefit from greater utility.  And I happen to agree.

Look, I know you think that lightning is the best way to scale, you have accepted that it will work before it is even implemented.  
I've seen that post.  A payment network in the "old" paradigm has always meant credit because we didn't have bitcoin.  Now that we do, a payment today with bitcoin is a settlement.  The payment is the settlement.  So they are no longer mutually exclusive.
I can't say whether he would object to it.  If I were to guess, I would think he would say something to the effect of "This is no different than an offchain solution except that it utilizes bitcoin in such a way to prevent theft etc..  So while I think it's a neat thing, the blocksize should not be restricted to make LN more attractive or force a fee market.  Bitcoin was designed to transition to transaction fees as revenue for miners, restricting the blocksize will make transaction fees so large that the nature of on chain bitcoin will cease to be peer to peer by virtue of being priced out.  LN should be in competition with the ability to go on chain.  The most effective place I can see where LN is useful is micro payments."
@_date: 2015-12-17 23:34:33
I suppose they might as well, they don't seem to listen to anyone anyways.
@_date: 2015-12-15 16:35:20


Sounds nice and centralized.  I have said this before, LN promotes bigger hubs as they can keep their transaction fees the lowest.  These hubs will have massive targets on them for monitoring and spying.
Please save your breath on talking about how they can't steal your money and you don't have to trust them as there can be many.  There will not be many as the big ones will marginalize the small ones since they get to spread their fees over more transactions.

Here it is, apparently they only have it for their vault.  I believe you have unilateral access to any coins held in this way and coinbase would not have the requisite keys to take any action with them either.  
Yes, it appears normal accounts with coinbase are full custodial accounts.  You have no control except through them.
As far as shared multisig wallets...Coinkite also has one and so does Copay.  I would say these wallets make it pretty darn easy, however if you take control of the private keys then it is your responsiblity to secure them and back them up.  So in the coinbase case I suppose not having to deal with that has some ease of use ramifications although with the trade offs.
I personally use coinbase for some of my bitcoin usage, I never store large amounts there (everyone's risk tolerance is different).

"it's been really hard to set up a wallet, buy Bitcoins and use them"
1. This person never states what is difficult about setting up a wallet.  Setting up a wallet is easy, and takes minutes on Coinbase or Circle.
2. Buying bitoins can be done with the click of a button on Coinbase or Circle.
3. Using them is easy for the places that take it.
So I'm still confused.
The only thing I can think of is this person referring to the time it takes to buy bitcoins which has nothing to do with Bitcoin and everything to do with the old financial system.

Absolutely correct.  Do a round of testing.  Do everything you would normally do to make a secure cold storage address, send a very tiny amount to it, then attempt to get those funds out of the address and back into wherever your coins are held.  I don't know what wallet you use, but you must SWEEP the key, don't import it (some wallets make the distinction).  This will give you more confidence and is exactly what i did.
Dont forget to destroy the test cold storage address once you get the bitcoin out of it.

I believe linux live cd is the recommended approach for full paranoia mode.  I personally used a new machine that I wiped to a known good fresh copy of Windows 8 and uninstalled all communication devices/drivers except for usb and turned off autoplay.  This had more to do with how easy it would be for me, I don't know linux at all and that spooked me.
I did the same thing in terms of verification.  I generated a key with bitaddress, then verified it with two different pages, i cant remember which, but probably bitaddress and maybe bitcoinpaperwallet (All of these steps occurred on the offline computer)

Dude, relax.  What you are witnessing is what Bitcoin fixes.  Yes, your bank shows your balance as debited, but behind the scenes your money is travelling through circa 1970 systems to arrive at Circle which takes DAYS.  
This is not growing pains, this is how long it truly takes for the money from your bank to arrive to Circle.  Your balance was debited, because some other balance in the system (not Circle's) was credited, but it has to do that through several entities on the way to its destination.
This is why the current financial system sucks.

This is amazing.  You store your bitcoins in this app and you don't back up?  You are your own bank, act like one (have a contigency plan).
At least now you have an HD wallet.  For gods sake, write your seed down and store it in multiple secure locations and transfer your bitcoin into one of the new hd addresses.

This.  But there is currently no easy way of doing this that I know of (multisignature paper wallet).  You can simulate it by making a cold storage wallet and split the private key into 2 of 3 shamir secrets and follow above instructions.

What kind of incentive structure do you have in place for your clients to encourage their vendors to sign up (allowing them to pay invoices in bitcoin) AND/OR pay their employees in bitcoin?  Have you considered a merging/partnership with an entity that can pay wages in bitcoin?
I feel these things would create a positive feedback loop for the bitcoin ecosystem, which would encourage holding bitcoins and closing the loop.
Thanks for the AMA

This person claims to have been sweeping the affected addresses.  He seems open to returning the funds.  In my opinion he and blockchain.info should be put into contact as they could help get the coins back to where they belong.  But you can contact him on that thread to attempt recovery as well.

Yes this is how you verify the passphrase, but PLEASE if you entered your private key on a machine that has or ever will be connected to the internet DESTROY it (the key and passphrase) and start over.  As cantonbecker said.  You can verify by downloading the page and moving it over via usb to your dedicated offline computer.
As a matter of fact, the bitaddress.org page has this same feature so I don't understand why you felt a need to verify through the bitcoinpaperwallet page.  Still a completely valid scenario though.

I guess my main point is that we should not have minimums or maximums, miners need to GROW UP and decide for themselves what they are willing to accept.  We can do this by removing these mins and maxes and force their hand.

"More than 1500 bitcoin community members will soon be converging on Miami for a direction-setting conference aimed at driving the currency from speculation to mainstream."
Let me tell you something, allowing that scum to get on stage and pull even ONE more person into the vortex that is GAW is a detriment to the above goal.
@_date: 2015-01-02 19:21:54
I do give him a break, its a tough position.  Even if Paycoin wasn't a scam, and it is, but if it wasn't I still fail to see how Josh promotes the stated conference goal?   Josh is the antithesis of this, which has been known for a long while and publicly admitted by Josh.  Moe at the very least has to own up to this part.
@_date: 2015-01-02 19:48:27
There really is nothing else to say then...your position is that even if josh is a 100% scammer that we should all just give Moe a break because "it's hard" and that you have NO position on whether Josh should be allowed to associate with this conference.
This is the kind of thinking that everyone is fed up with, it's time to take a stand against obvious scammers.  You SHOULD have a position on whether Josh is allowed at this conference.

True or False?  It is possible, even remotely, that the conflict/centralization of interest that Blockstream has now attained could be taken advantage of that is not in the best interest of Bitcoin, even by feigning support for a cause that other members knowingly support.

How does Josh help this goal?  He is the antithesis of Bitcoin and this goal.  He want's his centralized scamcoin to supplant bitcoin.  Not only that, he is a scammer, paycoin is a pump and dump to cover the money owed to his customers from the previous fantasy cloud mining ponzi scheme.

He isn't asking to fully trust the inputs.  He is clearly saying his value add is greater than the risk in certain cases, so please stop puking up the obvious.  Everyone knows you can't trust 0-conf.  EVERYONE.  Just like everyone knows you can't always trust even 1-conf.  That's not the point.  The issue is if you can trust it enough.  You can have risk models based on the current network, the size of the transaction, the coin history, whether they are a recurring customer, etc to decide whether it is worth it.
Your statement that 0-conf is not Bitcoin is absurd.  0-conf is just as much Bitcoin as 1-conf, 2-conf etc on down the line.  Each confirmation level has a degree of security.

If demand for space is unlimited, why did it take so long for the average blocksize to creep its way towards 1MB?  Shouldn't we have maxed out years ago?  As we know, this did not happen, we in fact saw gradual transaction counts increase (along with the price).  Given this is quite obvious your statement doesn't reflect reality at all.
Even if it were true, which it is not, why then is this some kind of argument to restrict the blocksize below which we could safely deliver?  If demand is infinite, as you say, then your precious fee market will exist at any blocksize.  Why then would you want to walk away from the ability to expand usage/utility/adoption of bitcoin?

Let me address a couple things...
1) Miners mining huge blocks to harm the system...
Well sure, this in my mind is analogous to a 51% attack.  They can really only do this if they have a huge amount of hash power anyways and it would be immediately apparent.  There is talk that a huge block takes a huge time to verify.  Who gives a shit!  A miner is free no matter what to not relay a huge block anyways.  They can ignore it today.
2) Defaults matter...
There is talk that the defaults are usually not messed with and that matters.  Well I would say that enough miners using the defaults would create opportunity for other miners to step in with the intelligence that not using the defaults would give them an advantage.
We should not be afraid to let these things play out and compete.

It was created to hard fork to 2MB because Core has decided to call the community's bluff, not throw in every conceivable spooky idea out of Luke's or anyone else's head.  You are not being fired, the network is forking to 2MB, that's it.  Continue working, you are a very intelligent person, the sky is not falling.
@_date: 2016-01-07 19:23:02
Miners can do this today by changing their own software, it merely allows the change as a configuration instead of code change.
Do you really think that by exposing it as a setting everyone will just run off and "randomly" as you say choose a number without regard to the fact they might be leaving consensus?  I think not.

If you can't see that Core is steering towards a settlement system, then I don't know what to say, maybe you are blind?  Your suggestion of following Mike makes no sense, he has exited Bitcoin.

How is it a kick to the nuts?  The market is disagreeing with them.  The sky is not falling.  I hope they don't leave out of spite or ego, but if they do then I think we are better off.  Even Jtoomin recently said (paraphrasing) "If you guys ever don't agree with what I'm doing I want you to fire me and fork the code".  I don't hear any of that from Core, it's more "It's our way or the highway, and if you decide to go against us we are going home".  Well sorry, bye I guess, we will not be held hostage.
@_date: 2016-01-17 01:06:58
It's easy to say this, but the reality is doing so would most likely not help.  They called the community's bluff, and the they happen to have bullets.  The way forward is for them to just merge the change once it goes out, and each team can work independently and collaborate as well.  This isn't about trading one dictator for another.  Both camps are represented now.
As much as Greg would like everyone to believe, this is not about firing an entire huge set of developers.  It's the economic majority choosing a different implementation for now.  Core is free to merge the change and keep developing their awesome stuff.
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:09:02

This is a battle of ideas.  Bitcoin

You know this is not accurate, the vast number of wallet options, especially spv, have eliminated the need for a user to have a full node wallet client.  Do you discount this variable completely?

@_date: 2016-01-08 06:35:10
Since you need the obvious pointed out, Blockstream is a for profit company.  They employ many Core developers.  The conflict of interest is that they intend to build 2nd tier platforms on top of bitcoin.  It's conceivable they would want to restrict on chain capability in order to increase the profit capability of any products sold as a 2nd layer.  Is that not clear?  In effect, on chain transactions compete with them and to the degree that on chain is limited/priced out their products would appear more attractive.
@_date: 2016-01-17 02:30:23

That's just not going to happen.  His goal with XT was to gain acceptance through a hash power voted hard fork.  So to exclaim he should code XT to immediately fork from the network is nonsense.  XT is designed to kick in only with support from the hashpower.
Yes, you are right, Core says they don't have experience with planned hard forks.  So when exactly do they plan to gain this experience?  Every day that goes by is a lost opportunity and makes the next day more difficult.  Hard forking now while the network is "small" is much easier than it will be tomorrow.  You bring up emergency hard forks.  This is what I don't understand.  If the network can emergency hard fork in hours why are we so afraid of a planned hard fork where all parties have advanced knowledge?

Saying Bitcoin Classic is an altcoin is Ad Hominem if they were a person (strangely enough ad hominem can get you banned around here if directed at a person).  It also happens to be an attempt of proof by assertion.  It's played out! Nobody is going to buy that argument anymore.  I wonder what happens when Core ever announces a hard fork, somehow that will not be an altcoin because it comes from Core.  You guys need a reality check, I hope it comes sooner than later with the economy forking you. @_date: 2014-10-09 03:58:52

I never said segwit wasn't useful, it is in a major way.  But when you see comments from for example Peter Todd saying he would agree to an increase to 2MB only predicated if all other devs signed an agreement that it would never happen again, how the F is that prudent?  Segwit is great, but honestly they are choosing that over a simpler solution now, which is to increase it to 2MB and keep working.  They are choosing a massively more complex solution, that will be released by May at best, will give an increase of 1.6X at best according to transaction history we see now, and will require soft fork acceptance which I imagine will take a while to activate, and even then will require wallets a change to software to take advantage of.
@_date: 2016-01-30 22:59:55
Jeff and Gavin are amateurs?  Sure buddy.  This is what is wrong with people, you think by someone deciding to run the classic client they are choosing new leaders, which is not true, they are choosing a client that has rules they wish to run.

@_date: 2016-01-01 06:26:19
I made a similar point back in time.  Nodes cannot enforce consensus for the anyone but the node owner, not the network.  Anything a node receives is untrusted.  And the verification it provides is asymmetrically provided to the owner of the node as only he/she knows the rules under which it is operating.
Core keeps twisting definitions to fit their model.  This is why the community is in an uproar.  They are not being honest to the original vision.
@_date: 2016-01-12 22:58:57
There is economic consensus.  The developers are but a tiny fraction of the entire community.
@_date: 2016-01-15 04:55:04
It doesn't matter, I'm just pointing out that there is more to the community than a few Core maintainers and Blockstream employees.  Core has become a monoculture of ideas.  That's fine, good for them, but that's why alternative groups and ideas are a good thing.
@_date: 2016-01-08 04:54:01
I haven't framed anything, I'm just asking questions.  Your contention seems to be that a centralization/conflict of interest could be good for bitcoin.  Interesting choice of words too.."...centralization efficiencies that Blockstream could lead...".

I never said it was ready.  Yes it will take time, I suspect it will be here as conventional means of scaling performance start to run out.
@_date: 2016-01-08 04:45:10
Can you perceive of any situation where the centralization of developers under one single interest could be bad for bitcoin, regardless of anyone else's ability to write and run any software that they want, given that Core is the de facto implementation?  And if you can, what counter to that power would you say would render it innefective?
@_date: 2015-01-28 07:39:35
It's no mystery that the "fraud detector" goes off right as the ACH transfer is about to complete.  It has nothing to do with coinbase fraud detection and everything to do with the bank.  She should raise hell with her bank and ask why legitimate transfers are being blocked.  She runs the risk of pissing off her own bank though.
@_date: 2016-01-15 03:31:39
That's funny, almost like you actually believe it.  Core nodes are susceptible to DDOS as well.  DDOS has nothing to do with what client you are running, you get flooded with requests that take out your connection.

Ok, I passed over that part of the OP's post.  My apologies, but let me address it.  Just curious, are you a developer?  I am.  I'm not claiming any special authority here, and I only ask so that you can relate, because I am, so I will speak from experience.  What Mike is referring to is that soft forks require very special considerations in code.  Imagine having multiple upon multiple soft forks simultaneously in code.  Imaging the complexity if those soft forks interrelate.  Given two soft forks (A and B) that interrelate the code has to handle 4 distinct possiblities.  None are activated, A is activated but not B, B is activated but not A, and both A and B are activated.  You can see this gets worse the more soft forks are in flight.  Not to mention that a soft fork is coded intentionally to fool full nodes into believing someting is true when it may not be.  Soft forks fool full nodes into believing something is true when it might not be.  This is what Mike is talking about.
As an analogy, I always compare technical debt to my garage and its 'cleanliness'.  Your garage, as you add items to it tends to become more and more less arranged.  This is a fact of thermodynamics.  Things tend to become less arranged over time.  Code is the same.  Refactoring is a tool for arranging things back in a neatly and understandable order.  Now the analogy of a soft/hard forks is hard to apply to a garage but let me try.  Suppose you want to park your car in the garage, but space has run out because the junk has filled up the space.  We have to get rid of junk, or rearrange the items in the garage to more efficiently take up space so we can park out car.  In our analogy of hard fork vs soft fork, a hard fork would be throwing out all the junk.  A simple solution, once and done.  A soft fork is rearranging the items (including the junk) to make space for your car.  Is the garage clean in the soft fork case?  Well you might say it is in the sense you can now park your car, but the junk is still there.  Over time, the junk will overwhelm your ability to rearrange the garage.  You will be forced to 'hard fork' your garage and get rid of the junk at some point.  Your ability to rearrange is more difficult each and every time.  Is rearranging the garage worth it or are you just delaying the inevitable and making your life harder when you have to again make the same decision.
Now, as far as him merging in these changes, he does so that XT maintains compatiblity with the chosen strategy by core to do all these soft forks.

Oh please, it is not to fire a team.  Core can merge the code and continue working.  They have awesome stuff on the horizon that I am sure you will have no problem convincing the economic majority to run.  Each team fights to merge their code in "main" aka what is running in the field.

I'll take a stab and say you present the block size increased as "rushed ".  This debate has been going on for 3 years now.  Also SegWit is complex, they are still debating on the details right now on the dev list.
@_date: 2016-01-15 07:57:07
Yes that's great, I'm aware some people predicted trouble ahead.  Maybe satoshi didn't think it was a big deal, maybe he thought he would still be in charge, maybe he thought he could convince everyone, maybe he had faith it would work out as it was Years and years away, maybe he had bigger problems to deal with than go crazy over a number that could simply be raised.  So many maybes, it's impossible to draw any conclusion from some action he did not take or something he didn't say.
@_date: 2016-01-15 08:00:12
What we can do is take his words at face value, and he simply said we could phase in an increase through a hard fork.  Just get over it man, it was anti ddos measure, that's it!  He even said in an entirely different thread that it would not be needed AT ALL eventually.
@_date: 2016-01-15 00:09:11

If they want to stomp their feet and take their ball home with them, then so be it.  I would rather have bitcoin developers that understand the economic majority may not always agree with them.  The alternative is a centrally controlled Bitcoin, and nobody wants that.

@_date: 2016-01-08 05:36:23
I think people are doing precisely that.  Core's actions have forked away from original visions of the network and have largely been diverted to LN.  The community at large is extremely doubtful about Core "betting the farm" so to speak on LN.  A highly unproven piece of software that by the way does not exist in practice at all.  To be more specific, the recent changes for segwit specifically mentioned the benefits to the cost benefits of opening and closing channels.  Core is driving at full speed towards an unknown.  The community, rightly so, is highly skeptical of diverting bitcoin towards vaporware.  That skepticism might have been decreased had Core accepted an increase to the blocksize while simultaneously working on some of these things, but they choose to stay quite hard headed on the issue.  And this doesn't even mention the recent RBF changes that many see as a problem seeking a solution.  In fact, I highly suspect the way RBF was implemented benefits the LN implementation in some way.
I don't think anyone wishes to diminish their brainpower or hard work.  They do wish to speak out on their direction though, and there is nothing wrong with that.  If people like Maxwell decide to leave, bitcoin will survive, and that goes for all the devs.  So here we are, the pressure is only going to increase.

@_date: 2016-01-13 04:08:34
Yes, it does, but a hard fork of bitcoin adopted by the economic majority is not an altcoin.  Its the opposite of an altcoin, it's bitcoin.  And labeling it as so while it is proposed is disingenuous.  Then you have nothing to worry about if it does not have consensus.
@_date: 2016-01-12 22:26:00
Blockstream employs a large number or Core developers.  If you are willing to accept that kind of developer centralization and don't believe that to be a dangerous conflict of interest then I don't know what to say.

Ahh, I would say he tries to use the connotation of that word to make an argument.  It's pretty easy to see, you could make the argument that is not the case though.
@_date: 2016-01-13 02:26:51
Ok, so you are upset about things they are saying.  Give some examples and we can discuss.  I'm not aware of them saying the draft BIP was submitted to Core, how is that relevant?  Did they give the impression that it was and it was rejected or something?  If you can also give the example of the impression Coinbase is switching.
@_date: 2016-01-02 08:59:31
What are you talking about? Tell me where Mike said his main concern was technical debt?  XT is a fork of the code that introduces new concepts.  Where in XT's charter does it say they want to get rid of techical debt?
@_date: 2016-01-13 02:38:38
I think the fact that Core came right out and said they were not planning ANY hard fork in the foreseeable future was the last straw.  Segwit is super duper awesome.  I hope it gets here soon, but they are saying released in May and then it requires some high x% activation and it requires wallet devs to change software to take advantage of, and current transaction trends would give us about 1.6/7MB.  I think there is genuine worry that bitcoin will enter a new economic phase because the limit is now being tested.  A 2MB blocksize was widely agreed to as "safe" from the miners at that most recent conference (they all indicate they want to see some sort of increase soon as well), and it seems to me (you could debate this) the economy wants some sort of increase as well (probably more, but 2 is better than nothing).
@_date: 2016-01-15 04:52:48
Reaching for the term alt coin only shows the weakness of your arguments.
@_date: 2016-01-08 05:20:15
Curiously an alternative client might be labeled as creating an "altcoin".  I'm sure some groups would attempt to capitalize on that word's bad connotation to manipulate favor where it could.  The groups "in bed" so to say with said conflict/centralized group would attempt that.  It's possible the groups involved to further that notion, might not be directly in bed with the centralized group, but merely are in agreement.  Said centralized group would most likely stay silent while it occurred as well, or merely half wittingly approved of the actions by silence.
@_date: 2016-01-08 04:23:09
True or False? A conflict/centralization of interest within the bitcoin core developers is bad for bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-01 00:33:39
They moved the goalposts and made it about non mining nodes.  It's easy to make the argument then that some farmer in central africa doesnt have the bandwidth to run a node, therefore we must not increase the blocksize.
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:20:51
That is certainly true, the dangers of co option are abound.  Your real last resort if you don't like how the economic majority is going is to sell your coins.  An unfortunate reality, but you have to be aware and prepared.

Come on!  You know good and well that submitting that kind of PR with classic is borderline trolling/poison pill.  If it is so great how about you guys merge it?
@_date: 2016-01-17 01:34:19
Reality is stranger than fiction..I can understand Core's position.  I really think Core underestimated a small bump to placate everyone.  If they had come out and said we plan to bump it to 2 first and work on segwit I think it would have been hard for everyone to swallow, but it would have held up the dam.  With them not adjusting to the community's dissatisfaction over the plan, it sealed at least this particular fate.  More than that though, when you throw in opt-in rbf and the generalized feeling from the community that they are going the wrong direction, in a sense it is also about new leadership.  Although I still strongly believe that they should continue working on their fork, they have awesome stuff that classic even now intends to merge.  Then people can choose their client as they see fit.

@_date: 2016-01-13 03:03:00
You can't think of Bitcoin being strictly associated with one repo.  ANYONE can fork it and make a proposal.  Pull requests can be merged in across repositories.  Bitcoin Classic is establishing rules under which it would govern its own pull requests and repo.  We are not choosing new emperors.  Everyone in the community has the choice of what software to run.  They have no power to tell you to run some software.  You have a choice.
@_date: 2016-01-13 02:59:49
This is the problem luke.  Bitcoin is defined by the economic majority.  Not Core.  So the fact it has no BIP is irrelevant!  It has no BIP **by design**.  You know that any BIP for this would go nowhere in Coreland because some handful of developers can NACK it into a black hole.
@_date: 2016-01-13 02:16:28
* Why are your reputations at stake?  Will you somehow be held liable if the economic consensus decides to overrule Core?
* Bitcoin Classic IS proposing a hardfork to the community, does Bitcoin Core have a monopoly on code and ideas?
* They are attempting to gather support, and they already have quite a bit.  Even if they did not have it, are they not allowed to try?
* Yes, and they will keep their word, they will run Bitcoin Classic once it has economic majority.  For them not to run Bitcoin Classic once it has an economic majority would be suicide.
@_date: 2016-01-08 04:49:26

@_date: 2016-01-13 03:12:23
I think they did say that, you are right.  I've said this before though, the miners are going to have to sort of grow up and make big boy decisions.  They need to weigh in more.  They don't have the only vote, obviously, but they do have an important vote.  It's unfortunate that they are mostly Chinese (not trying to be racist here or anything).  It's just that the Chinese culture doesn't like to rock the boat.  They aren't exactly natural leaders culturally speaking.

@_date: 2016-01-01 06:20:33
I agree with you.  Adam likes to say the miners follow the "economically dependent full nodes".  The fact is that Bitcoin has emergent behavior.  Nobody is really following any one.  Each participant is acting in their own favor (and sometimes, just as with societal behavior) that means acting in the best interest of the system as a whole.
@_date: 2016-01-07 18:08:17

@_date: 2016-03-16 05:38:12
This is coming from a guy that thinks we need to decrease the limit.  The truth is you have no idea.  You cannot estimate what opportunity cost the limit is currently imposing on velocity, utility and price.  Based on your previous statements it seems you believe that bitcoins value is derived mostly from arbitrary and vague "decentralization" when the reality is the price increases over the last years have been in lockstep with services being built around Bitcoin and the resulting utility, acceptance and transaction counts.
I think you are absolutely and fundamentally wrong.  Further, given you respond that there is no plan b shows just how much you care about transaction counts in the first place, which should give the OP all he really needs to know.
@_date: 2016-01-01 23:04:27
I hardly think that is a wild accusation.  It is a theory that is supported by past data.  It happens to fit quite well.
@_date: 2016-03-14 17:37:30
That is hyperbole.  It's quite obvious they are simply pointing to the fact they bought into bitcoin based on the vision put forth in that whitepaper.  Blockstream and Core are now attempting to steer bitcoin in a completely different direction.
@_date: 2016-01-02 09:45:22
A soft fork can make a full node believe something is true when it is not.  Sounds dangerous right?  Imaging you had a full node running with some business based on the validation it could give you.  A soft fork all the sudden could end up with your node telling you something is true when it is not.  Mike and many others have pointed out, that this is very very bad, and the choice by Core to favor soft forks introduces this possiblity.  They want to avoid a hard fork at all costs due to the possibility of a network fork.  But to do so, they introduce this other possibility of old FULL nodes, lying to their owners.

@_date: 2016-01-02 10:44:23
I don't necessarily think it is one sided.  It's just that he sees the costs of one way (soft fork) outweigh the other.


I'm not sure what to make of this.  Are you saying he should have coded the soft forks implemented in Core as hard forks immediately in XT?  If so, XT would immediately fork off the network and that would not be a good thing.
Mike has been ostracized from Core.  They pushed him away right or wrong.  Not only that, Satoshi him/herself has been figuratively ostracized by statements from Core. 


Let me remind you that Satoshi him/herself wrote ALL of the original code.  It seems to me that almost all of the old guard at this point has been minimized.  I find that disgraceful.
The nature of a hard fork is one where nodes that do not upgrade continue to operate on the old chain.  I personally find this a better alternative than soft forking the network and making those old nodes behave differently by virtue of making them think things are true when they are not.  The debt that comes with that is greater than the possibility of a fork.  We should be interested in supporting Bitcoin nodes and miners to the extent of their willingness to upgrade to the economic majority.

This is probably because people creating Russia accounts over vpn and funding with Bitcoin.  For whatever reason games in Russia go for something like 20-40% of what they do in the US.  Previously this was more difficult as you had to have a credit card tied to a bank in that country, but with Bitcoin it's not necessary anymore so I imagine there were a lot of new Russian accounts created recently.  Just speculating though
@_date: 2016-01-08 06:28:13
Even further, the developers (I really don't know what to make of a statement commited and merged in 9 hours, but this tells me very few are controlling things) are telegraphing their unwillingness to accept a hard fork.  This is a round about way of saying they will never agree to an increase.  Their "plan" was pretty firm on just about everything EXCEPT an increase.  No date, no nothing.  They are signalling that they will never accept one.  Do you disagree?

Roger has never advocated for every transaction to be free, just that higher transaction counts lower the average fee required to secure the network all things being equal.  This is the crux of a constrained blocksize.  2x transactions requires 1/2 the fees to achieve the same security.  For homework, calculate current security provided by fees today compared to fees + reward and how much fees would need to be to cover it.

I do recall. Your numbers are off in my opinion.  Saying segwit gives 10 tps when we get max 3 today and segwit with current transaction trends is about 1.7-2x does not result in 10.  Also your numbers were based on a 12.5 reward which right now we have 25.  So your off by at least a factor of 2, but probably closer to 4.

If the consensus is to implement XT then this would be Gavin and Mikes fault?  You somehow think they are suckering people?  Get off your high horse.  
Is it that your idea to keep 1MB can't stand on it's own?  It's clear you think that XT has a chance, so now instead of allowing the network to make its choice your side decides to claim authority and has resorted to censorship and now subversive techniques in code?

You do realize there is a difference in Core (the devs) and Core the github repository?  Someone has already merged in BIP 101 to a fork of Core and built it.  It happens to be called XT big blocks only, but it doesn't matter what it is called, only what it contains.  So if that is what you support, go freaking run it.  You don't need to wait for Core (the devs) to sanction a build for you, they are not gospel.
Or are you saying you will only support a BIP 101 build merged into the Core branch and released by the Core team?  Because that just sounds like you want to follow whatever Core (the devs) decide is best for you.

As usual it is hard for us feeble minded humans to see any further than our own nose.  In 2005 the largest hard drive was 500GB.  We now have 8TB drives shipping...a 16x increase in 10 years.
There is no need to throw in the towel and not serve as many transactions as possible while keeping node requirements at a sane level...and 8MB is quite sane.

Let's have some perspective here Adam, Gavin and Mike implemented BIP101 plus some other (probably rightly so questionable crap) and released XT because Core has decided that scaling bitcoin is a technological dead end and have stonewalled any MEANINGFUL increase to the blocksize (No, proposals to increase it to 10MB by 2030 are not relevant).  Some of us around here TRULY believe that if we go down this path it will have disastrous consequences and so we support XT because that is the better alternative than doing nothing or getting increases that are too small to matter.
So please understand that when you, blockstream, core, smallblockers, etc. start talking about changing Satoshi's vision by pushing everyone off chain that you are going to meet some SERIOUS SERIOUS resistance which is what you see today.  You keep mentioning bitcoins ethos and I just don't understand how you can believe that pushing everyone off chain is part of Bitcoin's ethos or Satoshi's vision.  Could you comment on that?

As long as we support a reasonable node over a reasonable internet connection then that is enough in my eyes.

I think it goes deeper than just these proposals.  My take on things is what has come out of these debates has shown a much much deeper division between the two camps in terms of bitcoin philosophy.  Especially around making bitcoin a settlement only layer, attempts to play economists by artificially constraining blocksize, and weakening of zero confirmation transactions.
I think this was another factor why Mike and Gavin personally believed that forking was necessary.  I know you think otherwise, but my opinion is that Core has strayed from Satoshi's vision, and that is why I support XT.

Another way of stating it is in terms of a stock.
Suppose all the [Sellers of a stock] form a cartel. They will have no problem funding themselves; they can all agree not to [accept any order] that doesn't pay high [price]. The users would pay this [price] because they have no other choice. (FALLACY)
Some [buyers] will try to [offer a price] lower than the cartel's threshold. One [seller] decides to defect from the cartel; he [accepts a lower price]. This costs him nothing, so this is a net profit for him (he benefits).
Seeing this, [buyers] will know that even if they don't pay the cartel's high [price], they can still get their [order filled]. Thus, their willingness to pay high [price] is lower (that is, the [seller] consumed their willingness). Thus, more [buyers] will try to [order at a lower price], and the total revenue of all [sellers] decreases.
But it's not just the one [seller]. Every [seller] will, individually, have an incentive to [accept a lower price]. This means that even with a low [price], it's easy to get [an order filled]. Thus, no [buyer] will want to pay [a high price], and the total revenue of [sellers] will be low (this is the tragedy - for the [sellers], and due to the effect on network health, for all Bitcoin users).
This is completely analogous to the classical instance of tragedy of the commons, where all herders would benefit if they all grazed just their fair share, but everyone is incentivized to defect and overgraze, depleting the resource and causing everyone to suffer.
You get the idea...
Again, I maintain you are simply describing a market.

This is simply untrue.  Each miner has the ability to include or not include any transaction at will.  The max blocksize is simply a protocol limit.  It has nothing to at all with the mempool size for 'valid' transactions either.

@_date: 2015-07-07 02:40:00
One option I have seen is BIP38 wallet generated on FOREVER offline machine.  Passphrase is Shamir split N of M ways (to your liking).  Copy of distinct split and bip38 paper wallet distributed to trusted parties while passphrase remains in brain and additional copies of the wallet located in places only you know (even on the cloud).
Another option is to simply shamir split a pure private key itself and distribute that.
Advantage of the first option is that you can keep the copy of the paper wallet on the cloud.  You obviously would not want to do that with a pure private key and the former gives you a digital backup if you need it.  Additionally, the former provides you with failsafe if you forget the passphrase heaven forbid.
You have to trust your parties pretty well.  That being said, if something happens, they know what to do to recover.
@_date: 2015-07-09 05:50:35
How is it 'damage'?  They are legitimate transactions.  They may be spam, but if the miner includes them then end of story.  Each miner is allowed to simply ignore transactions at any fee level regardless of blocksize.
So you are ok with the 'damage' accumulating over time while the mem pool increases?  A smaller blocksize does not prevent the miners from including this 'damage'.  So really what you are saying is you are ok with the price to bog down the network with 'damage' be as low as possible.
@_date: 2015-08-07 18:29:01
Yes its ok to leave them there.  Your coins will exist on both forks if you move them well before.
@_date: 2015-07-09 09:34:40
"Miners have no significant economic costs of adding a transaction to a block."
Oh but they do.  There are costs for time to validate the transaction.  There are costs to hold it in the mem pool. etc etc.  Let's not forget that transaction fees will eventually become the main revenue source for miners.  We see this behavior today, miners are choosing to not include transactions because the time to validate them places them at a disadvantage to those miners that do.  Well, in the future where miner revenue is mainly derived from fees, you can bet your ass the miners pay specific attention to each transaction and can choose what to include and what not to.  
This is called a market.  
I mean really, let's get down to brass tacks here.  You are basically saying that bitcoin should never expand beyond a 1MB block???  Do you really expect bitcoin to achieve global adoption upon centralized 3rd party offchain solutions?  
@_date: 2015-07-09 07:38:50
So wait, you seem to be arguing both sides.  The miners will form a cartel demanding an increased fee size, yet the miners will start a race to the bottom to include lower transaction fees?
You are simply describing a market.  There is pressure from both sides.  The users want lower fees, and the miners want higher fees.  There will be an equilibrium established and that is where we need to be, not some artificially created equilibrium.

@_date: 2015-07-09 05:53:31
That's a hell of statement.  Can you back that up?  Why would they fall?  Will miners magically accept less fee transactions just because the blocksize is bigger?

Nirvana fallacy.  Larger blocks means more transactions per second, which makes it a scaling strategy.  If you want to compare to some ideal then fine, it sucks, it will never get there.  That doesn't make it worthless.  Also larger blocks do not imply that the government can shut down bitcoin, they might at a given size, but the size where decentralization would be impaired enough to cause such a situation is up for debate.  Technology moves exponentially.  CPU, Network, Storage all going up.
So what are you saying?  Blocksize alone cannot scale bitcoin to VISA levels in any reasonable timeframe?  I'm sure most would agree with that.  This is why on and offchain scaling are important.  Even LN requires a larger blocksize to scale and serve the planet.

I know there are limits, but saying there are limits is different than saying we are at some limit now.  We have been at a max of 1mb for YEARS and in that time the software and technology have progressed.  Jumping to 2mb now is not going to destroy the system.  And just becuase 2MB can only serve double the transactions instead of 1000000x that we need to serve the galaxy is not a reason to stagnate.
@_date: 2016-02-29 21:16:05

@_date: 2016-02-21 21:25:09
Increasing the throughput of zero-confirmation transactions?  That makes no sense.  It has absolutely nothing to do with double spend.  It's increasing the number of transactions that can be written to the ledger.  It's simple math.  The ledger can only support a theoretical maximum transaction count of X.  Increasing the blocksize increases that number which means more transactions can be served.
This is just more nirvana fallacy.  So on chain can never scale to galactic payments, therefore we shouldn't scale it all?  That makes no sense.  You fall into another trap that increasing the blocksize would destroy bitcoin.  It might at some level, but it's widely agreed that 2MB won't.

Non mining nodes have their place in that you can have something to verify your version of truth to the specific version of software you have. This is pretty dang important for companies and the occasional security freak who wants to validate their spv transactions. All I'm saying is that non mining nodes don't produce work, miners do, and they have HUGE incentives to stay on the same rules.
For Adam to suggest that consensus is defined by non mining nodes is disingenuous since if the 51% rule of Bitcoin is broken then ALL bets are off anyways as they can double spend all day long and not break a SINGLE rule of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-08 07:36:40
No they are not, miners must verify work to ensure they are on the right chain.  When Satoshi referred to nodes, he meant miners.  Nodes may help to relay blocks that are valid, but they are by no means required.
"At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node."

From the first paragraph of the whitepaper... 
"The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of
events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As
long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to
attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers."

@_date: 2015-09-22 01:23:18
This fraud proof thing is something they just made up.  The whitepaper says this...
"As such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more
vulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker. While network nodes can verify
transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated
transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network. One strategy to
protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid
block, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to

So luke points at this and says we don't have this protection so all spv wallets might as well be compromised.  Well that is horseshit.  It clearly states that it requires an attacker to overpower the network.  If an attacker can overpower the network then bitcoin is fucked anyways.

SORRY the actual url is here...
@_date: 2015-09-15 02:33:53
You have to do the following.  The instructions are on the site located here...
1. Make an amazon wish list
2. Set the shipping address for that wish list
3. Set the wish list to public
4. Copy the wish list url (the url when you are "in" the wishlist) and paste it into the search box on purse.
5.  Use the name your own price slider to select your discount. (Your max discount depends on how many things you have verified like facebook, google, phone number, etc etc., if you verify 4 out of the 5 things you can get to 30% max discount on your first order).
6.  Place order
7.  Deposit the necessary bitcoin plus a buffer amount (automatically calculated to be (order + purse fee) + 20%).
8. Wait for order to arrive
9.  Mark order as received
10. Leave feedback and enjoy
My first order went off without a single hitch.  Spent around 200 with 30% discount.  Order was accepted on 4th day, received item on 6th day.  BEWARE do not buy gift cards through purse.  Only physical items.  Also my order was charged tax because I live in a state where Amazon automatically collects tax.  I am not sure how they determine this, maybe they tax the item if it goes to an address in a state where they do this.  You might be able to get around it by registering an account as living in a tax free state and putting a shipping address to your address in the taxed state.  I'm not advocating tax dodging here, just speculating on how it works.
I should also mention that me personally, I will only use purse with items that are delivered by Amazon.  This will make it much easier to deal with any problems if they came up.  But that is just my opinion.
Have fun

How in the hell do you get argument from authority there?  He is pointing out a fact.  The whitepaper title says exactly what Bitcoin was intended to be.  "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System".    Not a single quote from Satoshi contradicts this in any way, in fact there are many many many quotes in direct support.
@_date: 2015-09-08 06:59:05
And producers of that work are?  Miners.  If they are dishonest miners then Satoshi spoke extensively about that in the whitepaper.
@_date: 2015-09-08 19:04:32
I don't think Satoshi would even agree.  Are you seeing my point?  You are saying that consensus is set by economically dependent full nodes since they make sure the miners follow the rules, but miners as a whole can only change the rules if they have 51% hashpower, and if they have 51% hashpower they can double spend anyways without breaking any rules.  How would a node detect that?  I think it's pretty clear that the community would figure out what was going on pretty fast, and if that is the case it is not nodes that keep rule consensus it is the community by resorting to extremes like you say and changing the hash function.
This is completely independent of whether enough people can afford to run a non mining node.

By what metric?  Node counts?  Nobody wants to run a node man, SPV wallets are where everyone has moved which is why the node counts have suffered.  Is it really a surprise?  What is the incentive to run a node?  Satoshi is quoted as saying most everyone would move to SPV which is exactly what we see.

@_date: 2015-09-07 01:06:48
Regardless, you still did not address the question.  I asked you by what metric.  You guys seem to defend this position steadfastly with no meaningful proof other than "it will increase centralization" therefore we should never do it.
Satoshi said himself, that miners would eventually run on specialized hardware in datacenters.  He only ever referred to "nodes" as you mean them for verification..."Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to
run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification."
@_date: 2015-09-08 09:18:49
I guess it could be broken into two ideas.  Most proof of work consensus and rule consensus.  Nodes help with the latter, not the former.  Even still, that does not preclude the fact that there is a huge incentive for miners to enforce the same rules.

Mined blocks by default only have one transaction, it's called the coinbase transaction, this is the one that "creates" bitcoin and rewards the miner.  This can happen if the miner solves a block and does not include any other transaction other than the coinbase transaction.

Peter, you remind me of a lot of the master and phd level programmers that I have seen come and go over the years.  They all seem to have the same theme in their ideology and programming.  Dogmatic development and attachment to purity so extreme that they are unable to compromise on anything. Every single thing, no matter how unimportant gets the utmost attention and time to the point of not being able to deliver anything practical in any timeframe.  Solutions are overthought and overengineered to the point that other developers are so afraid to touch the code for fear of opening up a wormhole.  Complex solutions are desired over a KISS solution even if it has the most minor flaw and often for other extraneous reasons.  They never fail to point out flaws in other solutions, regardless how unlikely or unimportant those flaws are, and would rather see problems go unsolved than implement any solution with flaws.
A problem existed.  There was limited time to solve it.  A good enough solution was coded and released.
Everything is a compromise.  Do you not understand that?

@_date: 2015-11-04 20:39:35
Yes that is his belief.  I would note that Satoshi Nakamoto stated it as fact this would occur.  
Regardless, BIP101 gets us to 32MB piecewise linear instead of your proposed 8 4 years from now and can be soft forked down.  Is this going to force all nodes to be in a data center?  No way, I can absolutely say that I will continue to run one at those levels.  My bandwidth, storage and cpu will keep pace with it.
Talk is cheap, having a fork ready to go is at least something.  It is a requirement for a proposal in many open source projects.  Not only that he ran simulations for 20MB blocks, flawed or not, at least it was done.  He compromised already from 20 to 8.  You want 2 for the next 2 years and you probably don't even want the 2 to start for another year.  We are having issues NOW.

Satoshi saw all of this coming.  He was not concerned.
“At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.”   – 2008. – URL.
“At equilibrium size, many nodes will be server farms with one or two network nodes that feed the rest of the farm over a LAN.” – 2010. – URL.
“The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don’t generate.” – 2010. – URL.
@_date: 2015-11-12 21:13:16
SPV and web wallets have come to dominate the wallet play field over time.  This is why nodes have been decreasing, it has nothing to do with block size limit as it has not changed.  A normal user is not going to use the core desktop wallet, its ugly, unwieldy and the development on it is only for a minimum of functionality available.
I know a lot of people in the bitcoin community are pretty tech savvy, and the purist among them somehow expect normal users to use it.  Sorry, not gonna happen.  Even I use a web wallet + spv wallet combination.

There are two forces at work.  One is larger space means less competition for space and lower fees.  This will begin to make some miners unprofitable.  They then play the efficiency game, who can last the longest?  Some will drop out, the ones that remain are then allowed to enforce higher fees because there is less competition trying to "steal" market share at an unprofitable minimum fee.  These forces have an equilibrium ABOVE zero fees just slightly above their marginal cost.

With respect to larger blocksizes it most definitely is larger block sizes vs the status quo.  If you are suggesting that "other solutions" to fill this gap, then all you are saying is that nothing should be done and we need to wait for some magical (LN) solution to come along and save us.  This is by the way the change in vision that small blockers want to impose on Bitcoin and it will not work.  Transactions are LITERALLY the life blood of Bitcoin.
The game theory argument is false until it is not.  The upcoming halvening will put pressure on the miners.  The lowest hanging fruit is the tsunami of transactions begging to get into the chain.  Higher fees will only get you so far.  Fees will grow only to a certain point and then force everything else off chain or to another coin.  
I never said that a minority of miners would impose their will on the network.  I'm saying if nothing is done a MAJORITY of economic interest (miners, wallets, exchanges, full nodes, etc) will get together and do something if Core does not.
Please stop portraying that there are no alternatives.  That changing one parameter in code will destroy Bitcoin.  That this is complex and let the adults make the decisions.  Most Bitcoin users are not your average Joe, I am a developer in fact.  You make the argument that no one can escape from code released by the "core" development team.  It's simply not true.  Or maybe its better to say It's true until it is not.

Hey thanks for the lesson there Bernanke.  There are practically infinite number of sandwiches available to you in your city for lunch.  Does that make their price zero?  What you are describing is a market.  Miners can choose to mine low fee transactions to cut other miners out.  But they can only do that for so long.  It's analgous to many of the services you see today out there for free, they can only do that for so long before they must monetize, in the meantime they aim to take market share.

I maintain this is not a problem to solve.  If someone manages to hold on to bitcoins for 100 years and then decides in the year 2115 to dump them all, that is their right.  
You seem to think this would lead to a higher price?  How so?  The market prices in a certain percentage of bitcoins as lost, which makes the value of all go up.  If after 12 years Satoshi's stash gets put back into circulation, do you think the price will go up?  No, it will go down, because more supply.

I think it's hard to quantify.  My belief is most of the reduction is related to other wallet options.  You believe it has more to do with increased node requirements.  That may indeed be true.  Fact of the matter is there is no incentive to run a node unless you want to independently verify the blockchain for yourself, aka a company.  Most "normal" users have no interest in this.  This will be true with a blocksize of 1MB or 100MB.
It's hard to complain about the node count, when they simultaneously have no incentive to run. 
There really is no easy answer here, beyond a company and certain power users wanting the independent verification and others doing it out of generosity, nobody else wants to run a node.
Fixing the incentive will fix the problem.  Perhaps we should focus on that?

And this completely ignores the fact that more users = more utility = more value.  It also ignores the fact that a doubling of activity reduces fees per transaction required to subsidize the miners by half.  It also ignores the fact that the relationship between number of bitcoin users and number of transactions is not directly proportional.  The number of transactions should grow somewhere between directly proportional and the square of users.

I'm not advocating for it, I'm just pointing out the volatility argument against bitcoin really doesnt make sense.  It is an investment/speculation right now more than a store of value in the sense that we have not hit mass adoption and those who buy and hold are betting on that.  Only after mass adoption will you see stability.  Stability is not what you want from an investment, you want it to rise to the moon, and fast.

@_date: 2015-11-29 00:12:42
This is wrong, they do have protection in that nodes by rule would not relay the double spend.  Not only that, it was easy to detect with high probability that their transaction had fully propagated to the degree it was highly unlikely a double spend attempt would work. If it were so easy, there would be rampant abuse.  This change basically opens the doors.  Now what happens when someone goes to pay for an item, the transaction opts in, the store owner (this assumes his software even sees the opt in and alerts) says sorry you will have to take a seat and wait for at least one confirmation (could take hours) and then I will allow you to have your item.
@_date: 2015-11-05 02:49:06

@_date: 2015-11-05 21:15:46
That's not how it works.  There is an absolute limit to the number of transactions that can occur in a given day with the limits we have.  You can individually raise your fee, but you are essentially going to the front of the line at someone elses expense.  Everyone will attempt to raise fees until some give up.  Those that give up, will seek other alternatives.  This represents a loss of users and activity and thus utility and thus value.

You don't agree with original vision of Bitcoin?  Satoshi used them interchangeably, but did speak one time about how companies or anyone who wanted to could use their own node to validate against the miners.
“At equilibrium size, many nodes will be server farms with one or two network nodes that feed the rest of the farm over a LAN.” – 2010. – URL.
“The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don’t generate.” 
@_date: 2015-11-29 02:26:11
That is true but beside the point.  If a wallet by default uses rbf, which core is proposing, it makes receivers respect it as it would open them up to EASY fraud if they did not.  Today by broadcasting a transaction to major miners and pools the receiver can know with a high degree of probability that the network has accepted the transaction to their memory pools.  Now that is impossible with rbf as the transaction could be changed at will without all the craziness of simultaneous broadcast.  Now they can wait to perform a transaction directly after a block is found and know on average they have a time span of 10 minutes on average to change it.
Surely you see this?

Then you have nothing to worry about.  60% of hash power has already voted for BIP 100 which leads to larger block sizes than BIP 101 (early on) strangely enough.  If BIP 100 isn't implemented soon they will switch to larger blocks someway somehow.

I don't think he is right in that without a functioning payment network there would be no store of value, it would be greatly diminished though.  Fact of the matter is that the network only supports X transactions.  He is plainly stating that unless X gets much higher, then it won't amount to much.

@_date: 2015-11-02 17:52:39
If you don't think there is a gap to fill then this conversation is over.  If you somehow think Bitcoin will grow with a 1MB blocksize restriction and halvings every 4 years then you are seriously mistaken.  The security will drop until it can be 51% at any time, fees will be high, and Bitcoin will be dead.  Bitcoin needs a certain amount of security.  Right now everyone is paying for that security through inflation.  Do not take this for granted.  This will be going away soon.
Noone is asking Bitcoin to scale to everything on layer one.  It just needs to scale "enough".  And enough is way higher than what we have now.  This is what Mike and Gavin have been pointing out.  We don't need a "perfect" solution.  We need a pragmatic one.  Bitcoin not scaling to EVERYTHING on layer one is not a reason to pack our bags and seek other solutions.  We should scale it to what we can without sacrificing other important things too much.  Increasing the blocksize to 2,4 8 MB will not destroy those other important things.

@_date: 2015-11-05 20:49:56
I understand what it is, I don't need a lesson on it.  I know they can't steal funds.  That wasn't my point.  My point is a hub will not operate for free, so the most efficient ones will thrive.  Efficiency of a hub is directly proportional to its size as the ratio of transaction volume to blockchain writes will be smaller.  This will cause centralization.

This is a solution looking for a problem.  You never even elaborated on how they get put back into circulation.

Don't you think the possiblity of 1M of Satoshi's bitcoins back into circulation at the 12 year mark would create volatility in itself?  This also could create extremely bad behavior of miners.  Refusing to process transactions containing large unspent outputs if they are nearing the 12 year mark.

This is my understanding as well, and its the thing thrown around the most.  My point is deeper though.  How can we simultaneously say mining is too centralized, but when a solution is proposed to fix it we say "it doesn't matter, they can switch pools at any time".

What is so magical about their risk algorithm that they cannot do this upfront?  Why do they allow you to attempt purchase after purchase with the same exact bank/card details and keep cancelling them, and then those cancellations just so happen to coincide with the end of the ACH delay?  Why, after discovering you are high risk, allow you to continue to attempt to purchase or even keep you as a customer for that matter? Does some magical risk profile get downloaded at the end of each ACH transfer period for a transaction?
That's why I say it's obvious what is happening here.  Don't be naive.
They should be transparent.  If a transaction gets cancelled, they should tell you either 1) Coinbase considers you too high risk or 2) The ACH transfer failed beyond Coinbase's control

I disagree that it would go up now.  The market already prices in I suspect A LOT of bitcoins as lost.  If you remove that assumption the supply goes up.  You may have an argument that it fights volatility given you spread out the lost coins being rewarded to miners over time, but not that it leads to a higher price.  Even still, you cannot stop someone from dumping that is in the position to do so.  You say "Lost coins are a problem", i still don't see a convincing enough argument that they are.

It can and will happen if what you say come to pass.  Demand for bitcoin is not inelastic.  People have and will seek other blockchains if blocks are continually full and getting anything written is expensive compared to an alternative.

More censorship maybe?

Gavin clearly is speaking with the context of bigger blocks referring to BIP101.  When would we hit 1GB in that scenario? 20+ years???

Call your bank and ask them why your legitimate ACH transfers are being rejected.  Ask them why they think its ok to reject a transfer without notifying you.  Ask them why they are deciding where you can and cannot send your money.

You already know the answer, you were spamming the shit out of the sub with useless drivel poking a stick at the mods over and over.  You actually started out not bad earlier in the day, even though I think your posts about Nash and Hayek belong in @_date: 2016-07-07 14:56:54
You still have to acquire Bitcoin to do it, and when you run low acquire more.

This is a repost of an old article disguised as new news.
"The post F2Pool: Chinese Pools Will Stick with Bitcoin Core appeared first on Bitcoin Magazine." -&gt; no date, and the link is busted.
Quick search on the web and it was first published in January with the original link having been updated.

Very convincing and well thought out, thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2016-07-07 22:20:11
requires trust, and those are mined blocks of which there are only 144 per day.
@_date: 2016-07-07 18:46:21
How without using a custodial account?
@_date: 2016-07-06 16:29:26
All good and well, but without allowing the rent space (fee paying transaction counts) to increase and replace the reward we are dooming ourselves to a future of either...
* extremely high fees
* lower or stalled security (if fees cap out due to elasticity or tech efficiency can't keep up OR both, a breaking point exists somewhere you must admit)
@_date: 2016-07-07 01:27:25
Doomed as in it is a future that results and is negative.  That's pretty much what I said...on chain fees will be extremely high or a combination with stalled or lower security.
@_date: 2016-07-21 09:01:53
Poker stop acting dumb, you know damn well.
@_date: 2015-10-26 08:29:07
I believe so, you will be charged fees from your credit card.  It is definitely not classified as a normal purchase.
@_date: 2016-07-21 08:54:55
LoL, dude you were begging to be banned.  You were spamming the shit out of the sub.  It's obvious you were going to run here immediately and post about it.  What did you expect?
@_date: 2015-02-23 22:56:39
Good for you, try out USAA, they are friendly.  I personally have BoA and never had problems.
@_date: 2016-07-06 21:40:41
My points still stand, they are coffee neutral.  They can all be interbank transfers for all i care, everything I said is still true.
@_date: 2016-07-07 00:33:57
I didn't say innovating in other places will doom it.  I said not allowing the transaction counts to rise will lead to one or both of the outcomes listed.  Care to refute my actual argument?
@_date: 2016-07-23 08:42:50
First off, the btc link does show automoderation.  Second, the bitcoin link you gave just simply shows the posts on the subreddit.  Nothing about moderation there.
@_date: 2016-07-07 01:19:08
Only on chain transactions can pay for security.  Do you think Bitcoin is just magically secured?
@_date: 2016-07-07 00:48:02
Yeah, if transaction counts are not allowed to rise.  Some of the newer stuff addresses that (Segwit) and upcoming schnorr and maybe cut through? So that is good stuff, still transaction counts will need to rise even more imho to cover security. 
@_date: 2016-07-15 17:11:26
I don't see the connection.  I don't agree with his statements as much as everyone here, but making the connection between his opinions on whether bitcoin is a good thing or a ponzi and the blocksize debate?  Explain
@_date: 2016-07-21 10:29:39
That person asked for a ban after he posted a good twenty times with garbage no content incoherent posts.  Roger was trying to be civil, but he kept putting up post after post after post minutes between that were pure spam posts and they eventually had to do something.  It was not Roger, it was Soup.  Hell poker even gave you all the examples above.   The posts with actual content remained.  He was warned multiple times, he was basically asking to be banned, and got what he was asking for.  What's funny is that most of poker's posts are about ethereum.
@_date: 2016-07-17 05:36:44
Justification! Weeee.  This is automoderation, and a lot of those posts were approved.
@_date: 2016-07-07 03:30:57
Because it can necessarily price out transacting Bitcoin in certain amounts.  10 dollars a transaction fee prices out even finding a LN channel for anything less than 1000 dollars of value if you want to keep fees at 1%.  Not only that the elasticity of demand will kick in and people will choose other options which is bad for network effect.
@_date: 2016-07-21 08:59:50
You were posting title only threads with immediate reply's only by you every 5 minutes for several hours on end.  Incoherent posts with ethereum in there for no reason.  What's wrong with you tonight?  Take a break.
@_date: 2016-07-23 08:24:40
He is banned site wide because he was avoiding the original ban with sockpuppets, which is against reddit rules.  His original ban was because he posted around 30 times in a very short period spamming the sub.
@_date: 2016-07-07 20:55:01
Care to explain?  I don't get what you are saying.  How do you acquire bitcoin offchain without trust?
@_date: 2016-07-21 08:57:37
Scams, **Spam**, User Stalking, Excessive Profanity &amp; Blatant User or Mod Abuse will result in removal of posts and in some cases the user will be banned.
@_date: 2015-02-20 06:32:00
This is why they never give a straight answer...because they don't have one.  The ach just got killed on its way to coinbase and they can do nothing about it.  Rather than say its the banks, they stay quiet so they dont piss anyone off.

*NEW CUSTOMERS, FIRST TIME TRANSACTION ONLY
@_date: 2016-07-02 22:03:03
Ok, so please tell us.  If a whole 2 people sign some coins for these precious online pools that would swing it 10 to 1.  What would your response be then?  I personally could vote a non trivial amount and haven't bothered, because it takes about a millisecond of brainpower to understand it doesn't mean anything.  Yet since you like to lean on it so much, please give us your reaction in advance because I'm really tired about you guys leaning on a site with so few coins 'voting'.
I suspect you would then say "Well its just a few huge holders, so they don't count".
@_date: 2016-07-21 08:56:02
They were kind enough to leave the posts of yours that had actual content.
@_date: 2016-07-10 05:28:15
Tell you what, I will vote my coins if you go on record saying you will respect the will of the people if it shows a majority in one way or the other.  I'm not holding my breath.
@_date: 2016-07-02 17:31:36
If the price goes way up the network will increase hashrate until the marginal cost to collect the fees is equal to the estimated return.  "covering the cost" has no meaning, as that will naturally happen at ANY price on average.  This is why having a larger base of transactions to collect fees from would be better than a smaller amount as the "cost" (what users pay) is spread out more.
