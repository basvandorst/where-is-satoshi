what do they do again?
@_date: 2015-12-23 05:41:34
I like them and used them all the time ever since I started using my debit card. 
Free, not even the normal 3% card fee up to 3k and instantly in my account every single time. 
They must be eating some cost to let my card deposits be free but doesn't effect me theres nothing better than getting my BTC to my wallet right away.

Gary is a man of principles, and his principles align with what Bitcoin offers. I hope he makes the effort to learn more, he would be a great voice for us.

Slur will utilize the Bitcoin protocol to enable a party to access (and expose, if they want) any information about another party for profit while remaining anonymous. 
It does this by creating a marketplace for information. The information (government documents, corporate malpractice, celebrity photos) is encrypted by the seller and a short description is made public. Any individual can bid on information and the public can pool money to make a bid for the information to be made publicly available.
Like anything, this will be used in good and bad ways:
Good - It will enable and provide an incentive for whistle blowers to expose corruption in governments, corporations, or criminals. Those organizations will be held accountable for their actions: either they act honestly and don't end up with their info on the market OR they act dishonestly and pay the price to outbid the public to make sure they're the ones who gets access to the encrypted info. 
Bad - Hackers and thieves will have a more public platform to sell (--&gt; a bigger incentive to access) personal information.

Meant reddit notes

There is no sound logic in letting criminals get away with a crime like this, especially when one of the key features of this technology, if not THE key feature of this technology, is that the public has the ability to dissect the public ledger of the blockchain. 
Are we supposed to just sit back and say "no! hacker win! bitcoin anonymous! bitcoins gone!"? That sounds a lot like the image most of the population has about bitcoin and it is dead wrong. We are better than that gentleman.

I did mean reddit notes, thanks
I love the premise of community based equity. It just made me [irrationally?] angry to see it approached in the way it was - you gotta figure it out with your team, the community can't do it for you.
To be fair it is a very daunting task

Cool bro

Do you sometimes go by the name Satoshi?

He was an amateur and made it very apparent he didn't know what he was doing on Twitter.
Reddcoin was a joke, he didn't know how to deal with compliance issues and was basically begging the community to come up with an idea for him.
He released a screenshot of a BTC address implementation of the most basic kind. Let's face it, making a user generate a BTC address and allowing them to put it into a sig isn't innovative or cool. I could do that 4 years ago.
He looked unprofessional and desperate. 
You can't ask the people what they want, you have to show them what they need.

Karpeles bought hookers, Uphold is buying Voxel. 
At least Karpeles had fun.

Oh wow, so right now they only hold 75% of their Bitcoin obligations.
1460 btc (usd 500k) gap now looks a lot worse if the price rises...
@_date: 2016-02-14 22:32:09
They are -1300 on BTC right now, which is over $500k.


What's too quickly? A day? three days? a week? This is bitcoin we're talking about.

Recent history of Halsey Minor activity:
Starts Bitreserve. 
Cofounds Voxellus, VR company that makes a product that looks kind of like Minecraft. 
Rebrands Bitreserve to Uphold, takes bitcoin-skeptic stance. 
Issues currency called Voxels to be used on Voxellus platform and sells them on Uphold.
Takes funds that customer holds with him on Uphold and plays the market with them, taking very large risks. For example:
At this moment owes customers 5,343 BTC, but only holds 3,766 BTC. This is a deficit of 1,577 BTC, currently worth over $600,000.
