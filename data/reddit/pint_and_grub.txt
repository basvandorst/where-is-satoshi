Did you read the Republican congressional investigation oversight report into the IRS going after the tea party? The OIG sub report is the highlight. I’d suggest you do... turns out the IRS was unfairly targeting political leaning organizations, that lean left. That’s probably why you didn’t hear about it’s results.
Why would Trump change this policy, he would directly expose himself and his class to future audits. We know he hasn't been audited since 1998. How do we know this? You can file a FOIA request for a copy of the letter they send to individuals informing them they are under audit. He hasn’t gotten a letter informing him he is under audit since 1998.

So the IRS auditors evaluation reports were changed in 2003 by the bush administration and the republican congress. They now reward the volume of people they catch cheating on their taxes rather than the amount of money they bring in. So, they generally go after the poorest people who can’t afford a legal fight in regards to their taxes.

Trump put most the Bush Administration people who supported this originally back in their roles. Most of his administration is now 2nd tier remnants of the Bush Administration. 
Trump won with the old establishment GOP, Manafort, Stone, Ailes support. They put and worked to help the following campaigns Nixon both campaigns , Reagan both campaigns, Bush 1 1st campaign( he lost his 2nd campaign because he thought he could win without them), Bush 2 Both campaigns. 
Why would Trump change this policy? It wouldn’t help him personally. He hasn’t been audited since it went into place.

The conservative movement is misrepresented. That much is true. Almost all Extremist political ideology calls for high jacking the vocabulary of moderate movements.
First understand that conservativism is one of two liberal ideological positions. The other being progressivism. All people who are liberals are either conservatives or progressives. 
A great representation of actual conservative ideology would be OBama and his ACA legislation. 
Most conservatives in the USA are actually regressives or illiberals.

“Classical liberalism” as ideology is sound, however in presentation today’s almost all people who are proclaiming it are far right extremists trying to Jack It and distort peoples understanding of liberalism. 
Classical liberalism still also has classical conservatism and classical progressivism as its split dynamic. 
Classical conservativism is just a nice name for monarchists... it’s also why it’s abstract to even talk about being a classical liberal in the modern world as their
Classical liberal
Liberalism as its been practiced in western civilization for 300 years has always been split between conservativism and progressivism. 
Anyone who brings classical liberalism into a modern conversation is doing nothing but trying to detract from having an actual conversation about resolutions to problems today. They are not having a conversation in good faith.

I think you are misunderstanding the current deviation in value of cryptocurrency. 
The market in cryptocurrency and bitcoin is tiny. Absolutely minuscule. Gradually as people understand the concept it will become more widely adopted. The deviation in value will not swing so widly then as shown in all legacy valuation tools. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:55:57
With crypto 
You have your orginal loan amount you charge interest on. In addition if the loan you have out created a new business in that crypto when you  get your orginal loan back with interest your orginal amount of crypto will have more value than it previously did plus the amount of additional crypto you gained in intrest. 
With a legacy fiat money you only gain the fiat money you negotiated for in interest plus your orginal amount, the extra value gained in your fiat currency will be gained by the reserve group that originally issued the fiat.
