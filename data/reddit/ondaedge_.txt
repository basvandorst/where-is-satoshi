Not if the peer isn't online. In the case of a hub connected to end users, they might only be online occasionally when they open their apps. Plus, most end users would be terminal nodes in the network, ie the hub does not route through them. So in those situations you would have to consider the funds "locked up" from the hub's perspective.

This is the nature of a soft fork. If you imagine a venn diagram, there would be a big circle representing valid blocks under pre-segwit rules, and then a small circle representing valid blocks under segwit rules. The segwit circle would be entirely inside the pre-segwit circle, meaning every segwit block is valid to the pre-segeit nodes, but not every pre-segwit nodes blocks will be valid to the segwit nodes. This is the nature of a soft fork, and it's the reason why only miners need to upgrade, as non-segwit-supporting nodes will still be able to follow a chain that implements segwit rules.
In the case of segwit specifically, segwit transactions look like "anyone can spend" transactions to old nodes. So a non-segwit-supporting miner would allow this to be spent in a way that segwit nodes will see as invalid. This the segwit nodes will never accept that invalid chain and will continue on their own fork.

Jim is a gold bug not a salesman. I don't think gold will lose its monetary status any time soon. So long as it remains rare, it should keep its value, because it has the other necessary monetary properties of being fungible, durable, divisible etc.
Don't forget gold has a history of being money for many thousands of years. It's the original decentralised money. Its market cap is way above bitcoin's.
Just because you're into bitcoin doesn't mean you have to disrespect gold.

No, that would only be the case in a hard fork. A soft fork can only cause a chain split if a minority of miners try to impose the fork.
So long as the majority enforce the soft fork rules, all nodes follow the soft fork because the soft fork blocks are still valid to the nodes that don't know/support the new soft fork rules, so old nodes continue following the longest chain as usual.
@_date: 2017-02-21 04:16:33
It's a peer to peer network. The miner's node announces the block to its direct peers who retrieve it and update their chain, and then they in turn announce it to their peers, and so on until everyone has it.

No. Total fee income for miners is: avg_tx_fee * num_txns_per_block * btc_price.  Segwit is an increase in num_txns_per_block. As for its effect on the other two variables, that could be debated. My view is that the net result would be more income for miners.

@_date: 2017-02-25 02:24:12
That would cause a chain fork. So no one will enable segwit until at least a majority of hash power will follow them.
@_date: 2017-03-03 23:02:18
The soft fork needs to activate before nodes will reject blocks that violate segwit rules. Currently the activation mechanism is BIP9 which is a vote by miners only. There has recently been some discussion about alternative activation mechanisms that would take input from users.

It's not a mechanism that curbs anything. It's a mechanism that provides cryptographic proof to a light client so that they can know for sure if a block is over 1MB. This empowers them to make a choice about whether or not they follow a block size hard fork. The choice is still the user's, this is just giving them more knowledge. Before this BIP, a light client had no ability to make such a choice.

You clearly don't understand what a soft fork is. Miners always need to upgrade to a soft fork to avoid mining invalid blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-22 15:07:50
So won't core also need to be updated to generate and rememher these proofs before rejecting invalid oversize blocks?
Also, is it common for SHA256 implementations to make the midstate available? How will wallets implement the fraud check without that?

It's a self-regulating system. If mining produces a loss, miners will switch off/go out of business which will drop the difficulty level until it reaches an equilibrium.

That argument is irrelevant. This is what I replied to:


I corrected their interpretation of that data. Less than 1800 per day is fewer blocks which is hash rate decelleration.

That implies hash rate deceleration which in a way is bearish

Actually I meant to say exactly what I said. Check your math.
@_date: 2016-11-02 06:07:24
By buying 1 bitcoin you are buying 100 million satoshis (the sub unit of a bitcoin). You can buy fewer satoshis if you want.  For example, you could buy $100 worth of bitcoin, which will get you ~13.8 million satoshis, also known as 0.138 bitcoins.

Pruning only makes you less useful because you can't be used as a sync node.
There's nothing wrong with using a full node as a wallet. That's how Bitcoin was designed to be used. I think laptop full nodes are a good use case that we should strive to continue supporting. In fact, it would be nice to even support smartphone full nodes.

Because there's no user signalling in UASF.  Node count has no real impact other than being a paychological factor. Each user makes his or her own choice as to which chain to follow and which chain to dump in the event of a fork.

Technically segwit only needs &gt;50% miner support to activate it. Those miners can orphan non-segwit-signalling blocks. In reality you'd probably want &gt;75% before starting such a scheme. 
@_date: 2016-05-27 13:55:17
No I'm not basing this on a single data point. I use bitcoin regularly and never have stuck transactions. A single person paying 4 cents would make no difference. It would take thousands of people per 10 minute period, all paying 4 cents, to sustain that higher fee. I am simply talking about the present situation.

Well as a user, I currently have no incentive to reduce my on-chain transactions because the cost of block space is so low that it's irrelivent to me. So while I appreciate you proposing solutions, I don't actually need one because I don't currently have a problem.
If fees go above 30 cents then I may start to be interested in ways I can reduce blockchain usage.

So everyone who needed to use the road to go to work could do so every day for only $8 per year. Surprisingly, a large group of hooligan joyriders lost interest after the road was no longer free, and they mysteriously dissapeared forever, leaving everyone else to live happily ever after.
