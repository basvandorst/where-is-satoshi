It should be "Injecting exploits into your PC or mobile" the last one would be. "Thanks for the free btc."
@_date: 2019-07-25 16:13:28
Cool. Bans crypto making?
@_date: 2019-07-01 21:17:14
The time traveler said itll be around 25000 by October.
@_date: 2019-07-08 11:52:55
Or how about no memes?
@_date: 2019-03-10 18:07:22
You could probably find an ebook like that for free.
@_date: 2019-03-10 19:12:54
Which story?
@_date: 2019-03-10 18:05:17
Rambo had a war with banks?
@_date: 2019-03-10 18:06:43
Probably couldn't afford a decent meal after buying that car. Jk
@_date: 2019-11-24 18:44:23
When I sent out a couple yesterday I noticed the fees were higher. So it's probably just that you used a lower fee. You can see how many unconfirmed transactions there are on a website. You're probably not alone.
@_date: 2019-03-04 20:52:02
Dont know if it matters but on your screenshot of your wallet address it says bch. Its bitcoin cash. 
@_date: 2019-03-02 16:19:12
Isn't he deceased?
@_date: 2019-03-02 17:03:24
@_date: 2019-03-10 23:43:31
Plus the interest of that loan.
@_date: 2019-03-02 16:20:28
@_date: 2019-03-02 15:47:19
Dont you need coins on an address at the time a fork happens to get the forked coins?
@_date: 2019-11-11 06:15:14
So if someone did that, then they would wait for confirmations? Lol.
@_date: 2019-11-06 00:10:42
That's what I got too
@_date: 2019-03-04 22:03:20
He bought bitcoin but used a bitcoin cash wallet  address to do it. If you looked at the blockchain link he posted you'd see it. 
@_date: 2019-11-09 14:29:37
@_date: 2019-11-03 00:32:17
Purse.io or something like that.
@_date: 2019-11-25 02:48:12
What are those other checks you are talking about? And what is to board the block?
@_date: 2019-11-21 06:27:14
You clicked on it. Looks the same?
@_date: 2019-11-05 22:11:33
2 bitcoins and 90 ether
@_date: 2019-03-10 18:01:58
What about coincards.ca
@_date: 2019-11-05 22:12:34
Then invest a small amount into other altcoins that you research and figure out if they have potential.
@_date: 2019-08-09 15:10:30
What this guy said.
@_date: 2019-08-20 11:37:28
I think that anyone that knows about cryptography would be able to recover a dead hard drive and not send it in to be repaired. They're smart enough to figure something like that out. They would also be smart enough to back up their keys since they are the creator.  Whoever is claiming they're satoshi in that post is a fake.
@_date: 2019-08-20 23:32:08
@_date: 2019-08-09 15:09:43
If its generated on a website then it can be sniffed and maybe stored on the website.
@_date: 2019-08-31 05:08:15
So is using mycelium or bitcoin core. I think almost every wallet gets you a qr code. Why would anyone want to generate one on a website?
@_date: 2019-10-10 01:18:33
Which miner are you using?
@_date: 2019-08-31 21:27:35
Every laptop today has a cam and cams for PC are cheap to purchase.
@_date: 2019-08-24 16:06:42
Sound like a scam.
@_date: 2019-08-19 21:18:14
Based on your comments its obvious that you dont know BTC is mBTC
@_date: 2019-08-20 23:31:31
@_date: 2019-08-22 01:33:52
Did you look on Google?
@_date: 2019-08-09 15:11:48
100 is too much. You can even send 1.00. But just get a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2019-10-20 02:12:04
Must be an American thing?
@_date: 2019-10-26 07:25:02
They need help with bitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-22 01:42:49
Did you look at  ?
@_date: 2019-08-09 04:45:00
With paper?
@_date: 2019-08-09 04:46:10
@_date: 2019-10-10 01:25:31
Nice way to advertise for yourself.
@_date: 2019-08-09 15:07:58
Nice lol
@_date: 2019-10-18 23:11:43
@_date: 2019-08-31 21:26:38
I always use PC and mobile to make transfers using qr codes.
@_date: 2019-06-25 12:49:13
Lol there are some people that dont know what ice hockey is though too.
@_date: 2019-08-18 09:00:21
 mBTC is also btc. Read the article.
@_date: 2019-08-18 14:34:32
I read it. You have no clue what you're talking about
@_date: 2019-06-02 17:58:10
Isn't someone's crypto savings account their personal wallets?
@_date: 2019-06-16 17:16:51
Wow you should just buy an asic or 2. Mine it yourself.
@_date: 2019-06-16 20:22:47
Which miners do you have?
@_date: 2019-06-23 18:31:35
Nice I overpayed way too much last night I guess.
@_date: 2019-02-27 16:19:23
I dont understand
@_date: 2019-06-25 03:00:48
It's a leather wallet I got for Christmas. I use it cause it was a gift. :p
@_date: 2019-10-25 21:38:44
Cool. Never heard of your challenge before. Got something to do in my spare time now
@_date: 2019-06-02 17:05:39
I think the bottom one is the fee the middle or top is the one you sent and middle or top is another address in your wallet
@_date: 2019-06-01 16:39:28
Anyone can forge "bills". How would people know if you're not just trying to scam?
@_date: 2019-06-20 03:18:10
What is begeining?
@_date: 2019-06-02 01:31:02
mbtc as well. Seems easier for me.
@_date: 2019-02-26 18:28:05
I'm looking for low fee options. Obviously you pay a fee no matter where you buy it.
@_date: 2019-06-15 03:40:10
@_date: 2019-06-02 18:09:58
Lol good answer.
@_date: 2019-06-25 12:06:08
Lol I'm telling you it's an NHL teams logo
@_date: 2019-10-10 02:34:03
I know. That's why you should get ads or referrals.
@_date: 2019-06-04 03:06:21
Hopefully bitcoin jesus will be able to heal everyone that hodls.
@_date: 2019-02-28 15:13:30

@_date: 2019-02-25 22:21:56
If someone plans on running a node, then they should know how it works. setting one up is part of it.
@_date: 2019-02-26 06:42:14
Did you try looking at YouTube videos?
@_date: 2019-06-25 18:25:56
Haven't had a favorite team since Gretzky left the Oilers.
@_date: 2019-02-28 22:14:46
I think so lol. Must be a sign from the future
@_date: 2019-06-17 05:08:16
A gambling addiction
@_date: 2019-06-01 16:57:54
Theres a place called hygeia hospital in Greece that specializes in brain cancer. Did you research this place?
@_date: 2019-02-28 05:11:28
I was just posting that as a joke. Found it in a wallet lol.
@_date: 2019-06-01 16:44:49
And theres a hospital called Mitera general. Its affiliated with Harvard and Yale children's hospitals. Should be better than anywhere else.
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:06:40
10500. Your time travelers a fake.
@_date: 2019-02-26 18:30:44
Plus you can use a reloadable Visa. No need to put your banking details unless I'm selling
@_date: 2019-02-27 09:10:02
Dont know what you are trying to do but you can use bitcoin to buy on amazon. 
@_date: 2019-02-27 20:27:30
Yeah and?
@_date: 2019-02-28 08:12:06
I would like to know too lol
@_date: 2019-02-28 00:00:48
@_date: 2019-06-01 15:50:39
It's just the government's way of getting their share of someones profits.
@_date: 2019-02-28 06:19:00
I was just joking. I'm not rich and it's a little bug in an app that displayed the currency wrong.
@_date: 2019-06-30 18:01:40
It would be nice but I dont have any c0d3r, hax0r, or progamer skillz.
@_date: 2019-02-28 15:12:53
That amount you see in the bottom that reads 5 million is the price from an exchange. I'm not in south America lol. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 16:51:29
Yup lol
@_date: 2019-02-25 21:56:30

3Gnhq9y8NLEfgQNwvkvrKKpWWurWQhSABF send em here lol
@_date: 2019-06-02 04:48:05
That doesn't look that simple. Especially to someone that doesn't have a clue what it's for.
@_date: 2019-06-23 18:43:11
True I usually look at current fees and unconfirmed. But not yesterday lol
@_date: 2019-06-25 11:46:20
That's a Boston Bruins fan.
@_date: 2019-06-16 23:31:29
What are your plans for them?
@_date: 2019-12-10 19:07:29
With the bitcoin miner you're going to purchase.
@_date: 2019-06-02 17:04:13
How did you send to 2 addresses? Check your balance on your wallet again.
@_date: 2019-06-20 01:11:01
Fake. You cant mine bitcoin on a phone
@_date: 2019-06-25 12:06:47
Look it up. I use to be a hockey fan.
@_date: 2019-02-28 07:17:49
It is usd
@_date: 2019-02-26 18:34:55
Should've added that I'm looking to buy small amounts over time. Those fees will add up 
@_date: 2019-12-10 03:45:37
If it gets to a million by 2030 and you own a fraction of it. Then you won't be a millionaire.
@_date: 2019-02-27 20:09:03
Why isn't canada in there?
@_date: 2019-02-26 18:29:58
I'm on a couple exchanges but looking for recommendations lol. Did I type my request wrong?
@_date: 2019-12-10 19:07:03
Look up bitcoin mining profitability.
@_date: 2019-12-10 22:04:40
  
There are more if you google bitcoin mining calculator.
@_date: 2019-06-06 00:47:54
$10? Or $10000
@_date: 2019-12-24 01:38:06
His plan was to eat his twinkie?
@_date: 2019-12-10 19:28:50
You can set how much energy costs in your area on the calculators page.
@_date: 2019-06-02 04:10:53
mbtc it is
@_date: 2019-06-29 16:42:44
Never watched any of them. Anyone that is bitcoin enthusiast right now is living during the documentary that will be aired in the future.
@_date: 2019-02-25 21:53:46
If you have bitcoin-qt, cant you run a node for free?
@_date: 2019-12-10 22:06:31
I just pulled this up on google.
Brazil, March 2019: The price of electricity is 0.172 U.S. Dollar per kWh for households and 0.146 U.S. Dollar for businesses which includes all components of the electricity bill such as the cost of power, distribution and taxes.
@_date: 2019-12-10 22:13:50
What about LTC? I read somewhere the hashrate dropped alot.
@_date: 2019-04-14 16:16:39
If they can post on reddit about losing crypto on an exchange, then they should've read all the posts on here about not storing your coins on an exchange. Obviously they didnt think things through too much. It's both parties fault especially the users for leaving it on there.
@_date: 2019-12-10 19:04:49
Obviously. But did you read what he wrote? A million before 2030. That's it. Nothing about getting to 4 million. Try and be an ahole somewhere else. You failed miserably.
@_date: 2019-12-10 04:30:33
He said a million dumbass. He didn't say 4 million or millions.
@_date: 2019-12-24 02:31:41
@_date: 2019-04-07 19:26:19
None cause theres no line that goes across them. Just see peaks 
@_date: 2019-12-10 03:49:17
Hope he stays on track until 2030
@_date: 2019-04-19 21:20:25
That sucks. Hope that doesn't happen to people anymore. They should educate themselves about proper storage if they're willing to buy it. I would if I was investing that much money.
@_date: 2019-04-17 18:27:45
Satoshi = McAfee? Or McAfee = satoshi?
@_date: 2019-12-07 08:10:02
Probably not.
@_date: 2019-12-24 03:06:17
Which documentary is that?
@_date: 2019-08-18 14:36:44
You dont even know what mBTC is and you use bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-09-21 16:55:20
Theres only 1. Buy and hodl.
@_date: 2019-09-22 16:01:10
mBTC it is then.
@_date: 2019-09-22 18:07:46
@_date: 2019-09-22 15:59:56
Why is it experimental
@_date: 2019-09-28 18:33:06
Probably. We must have the same leprechaun working for us. Some crappy lucky charms.
@_date: 2019-05-26 18:46:30
It can be profitable. I mined an altcoin worth 0.005 bitcoin in less than a month using a 1050 ti 4gb card. You just have to know what to look for.
@_date: 2019-05-05 00:28:26
i would never hurt you. i dont know where to go from here lol.
@_date: 2019-05-02 03:50:09
@_date: 2019-05-04 19:59:45
Same. Came up with base 64 but no clue on how to go any further
@_date: 2019-05-19 18:23:35
Mycelium you can set your fees
@_date: 2019-05-31 16:06:55
It's a possibility
@_date: 2019-05-05 01:21:42
