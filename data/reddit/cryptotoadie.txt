Yes, for Global Coffee Payments, it probably is. Bigger blocks don't solve the problem. Still need to wait 30 minutes to confirm. Lightning solves the fee AND the time problem. They are nearly instant.

A lot of people knew it was a ponzi but invested anyway since they thought they could get out in time.

After two payments, the channel paid for itself. All further are free (minus node fees).
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:29:25
Just like Bitchcash, to slow for coffee. The fee is only part of the issue.
If only one project was rolling out a non-linear scaling solution... Hmmmm

Yep. Segwit is working. All Btrashers have their heads in the sand. Dolts.

BTC is not good for Global Coffee Payments, however it is succeeding as the most secure store of value.
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:32:49
Haha. Are you retarded? Every exchange on the planet has a warning that ETH transfers are delayed. Because they are encoding every crypto kitty transaction onto the blockchain for eternity. ETH is the only crypto that has achieved scale and they have worse problems than us. Not to mention they are severely decentralized because full node bandwidth is out of reach for 95% of the population. Not to mention the Blockchain bloat...
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:08:27
Imagine if we tried to scale the internet by raising the MTU to larger than 1554 bytes? That is what bcashers are doing for long-term scaling.

@_date: 2018-01-11 18:13:32
Fees have remain constant since 2011 in terms of Satoshis. Empty-chain centralized shitcoins are currently cheaper. If they ever catch on, they will have the same scaling problems. Take a look at ETH.

Interesting insight. +1
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:46:40
It is analogous to how video is streamed (H.264 compression). Segwit similarly compresses the same data, hence less is needed to do the same thing. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 03:13:54
Segwit does it by aggregating signatures. I think Schnorr Sigs does the same thing in a different way.

Using the term "IOUs" is retarded.
Lightning enforces the transfer of BTC using smart contracts. Guess what, ALL transactions on the BTC blockchain are governed by smart contracts. In that sense, ALL transactions on the chain are IOUs, hence it is a retarded used of the term.

Many people (including me) are working towards making this very easy to use. Right now it is a bit confusin.g and not user-friendly. Think of the internet when you had to enter raw IP address. It sucked at first too and then things incrementally got better.
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:01:30
It is advantageous to open a channel with a well-connected up so you could leave it open for a long time. If you do 2+ transactions, the channel has paid for itself. Any more is just gravy.  I think you can keep these channels open indefinitely. 
I've been playing with the zap wallet. Not too shabby. Feels like we are doing a new layer on top of bitcoin. Oh wait, we are!

@_date: 2017-12-14 16:55:52
It is not the fees, it is the fee estimation software. 140 sat/byte would definitely get confirmed in 10 minutes. Use GreenAddress wallet (or similar) where you can set your fee manually.  
Don't fall for the BCH shills in this thread saying othewise.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:37:55
If you used a wallet like GreenAddress that supports RBF (replace by fee), you could replace the fee and speed the transaction.
Otherwise, google "transaction accelerator"

The dirty secret the Btrashers don't want to talk about is BTrash still can't be used for Global Coffee Payments because they still have to wait for the next 3 blocks. Low fees are only part of the equation.
Lightning is instant AND (projected to be) cheap. BTrash killer, not just a gap-closer, IMO.

Rogers argument is silly. BCH has low fees because their blocks are nearly empty. If they were full, the fees would rise. So his premise is ‘use BCH because or blocks are empty’. But doing that will cause fees to rise....

No, your fee estimator is wrong.
1. Use a wallet (like GreenAddress) that let's you set you own fee.
2. Go to this site: 
3. Don't look at the suggested fee, rather look at the mempool chart.
4. Decide how long you are OK waiting, and pick your fee manually.
Too bad fee estimating software doesn't typically work that well yet.

@_date: 2017-12-25 12:59:43
Also look at the chart here:
Ignore the suggested fee though. Looks like 160 sat/byte transactions are clearing on the next block fine.
For wallets, check out GreenAddress. You can set your fee manually and it has RBF. Only thing I dislike is the shared custody, but for small amounts is fine.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:50:17

There you go talking out of your *mouth* again. Sheesh.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:33:14
If your wallet supports Replace By Fee (RBF) like GreenAddress, you can change the fee and speed your transaction along. I've done it myself.
Otherwise, google 'transaction accelerators.' I haven't tried but I think it might work.

Gotcha. Fair points. Nothing on his list is an iOS project, no?
One thing I have against these other projects is they use languages that I personally think are inferior to Swift (start holy war, haha) or maybe Scala. I am from the C world and Swift has captured my interest.
Interesting thought - so I am not doing this to profit. I wonder if an open-source iOS swift lightning wallet would be in order here? I've never started and OSS project before. Maybe now is the time?
Imagine a beautiful iOS bitcoin lightning app, slick UX, the lightning complexity hidden from the user hitting the app store. OMG, I think people would go bananas. Any devs that worked on the project, I think would be sought after.

Had my postman tell me that Amazon saved his job.

Altcoins are anchoring their trust models in the BTC blockchain. Pretty freaking cool.
@_date: 2018-03-01 21:30:15
This is as much a crypto as American Airlines Airmiles are a crypto.

Does anyone know a good collab tool we could use for the design part of this project? We used one at Nike, but I can't remember the name..
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:24:58
The last revision I saw didn't say that. I thought they corrected it?
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:50:51
I wish I could. I went through a nasty divorce and had to delete all my posts on reddit from my old account. My crazy ex was trying to use my posts in court against me. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 17:34:50
PROTIP: If you are a BTC whale, keep it a relative secret. OPSEC is important with an immutable asset.
If you are a BCH Whale, let everyone know. If you get robbed, Roger Ver will roll the chain back for ya :)

If Russia does this, I will eat my own piroshki on national television.
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:24:01
Gawd I wish they had deposits. I would recommend this app to throngs of people who ask me about bitcoin. Hoping they add it soon.
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:22:14
Wait, RogerScamVer told me BTC was too slow and expensive?
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:27:09
Yeah - probably will fire a nice buy order when this reddit is full of "the sky is falling" posts like this. Usually a really good buy signal.
It's like people are handing out free money. Seen it so many times before.
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:36:49
Oh snap. Chart-burn. :)
@_date: 2018-03-02 01:40:54
@_date: 2018-03-02 23:54:25
The point isn't the result. The point is it was not a pre-mine by definition. :)
@_date: 2019-01-21 22:34:53
Opendime and cash still work ok. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:25:24
BTC and BTrash both have the confirmation issue, which Lightning aims to solve.
@_date: 2018-11-05 17:06:14
All you did was lay out the case on why Warren is too chicken to short something he is SO SURE about. Thanks

Until the bitcoin blockchain can store images and video in their native formats, this is all nonsense. Slicing up the data and needing special software to retrieve it doesn't count.
@_date: 2018-11-04 06:02:19


Or lost them.
@_date: 2018-03-18 03:18:10
And, trust me, all props to the pioneers in this space. I would be riding the shoulders of giants. That roasbeef dude at lightning labs is a freaking legend in my book.

If it works, you da man.
Every time I try to send LN, I can't get a route.

People are using Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:21:06
This is how past boom bust cycles have worked. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:51:28
Go Schwab. Those kids are legend.
@_date: 2018-02-25 06:05:10
Bitcoin disrupts gold. Gold has lasted thousands of years not being a currency. There is your answer.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:30:13
Haha. I remember these same posts when bitcoin peaked at $266 a long time ago. Time has proven those sellers were actually "stupid money".
Stock and crypto markets transfer wealth from the impatient to the patient.
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:13:30
If it really happens, kudos to them.
Holding my applause until I see the transactions...

To be fair, these devices have already been produced. Should read "DragonMint 16Ts Prepared For Shipment"

Employment is soft slavery and we all know it. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:26:04
It is equivalent to what happened to video - we compressed the living crap out of it. I think of segwit-like solutions like H.264.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:46:20
Haha, I was taunted on r/bitcoin for being a bagholder at $300. HODL'd that sh&amp;t and now look at me.
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:07:07
This was a referral scam that happened to use bitcoin. They were not promoting bitcoin directly.
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:34:50
Donated. Feels good, man.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:37:30
I gave my kid 2 bitcoins on a paper wallet in 2013. He accidently ran it through the wash. Haha

Haha. You can snort ok through a New Yorker ad mailer just fine (I’ve heard).

Why the hate for my boy Barry?  He has been (and still is) a proponent of BTC.
Notice his company owns ZERO ETH and ZERO BCASH.

Exploring and then the rain trapped them.

Please list one prediction Schiff has made about bitcoin that has come true. I'm listening...

Under a million a year, huh? *rich guy smirk*
@_date: 2018-07-18 19:00:53
Nope. The sellers need to make money.
@_date: 2018-02-22 20:45:12
u/evoorees is a twat. But good job on this!
@_date: 2019-09-04 23:11:02
Aw, man. You let a lot of free money slip through your hands.
Go get that BCH and BSV. I think that shitcoin-casino Coinbase supports both for conversion.
@_date: 2018-07-16 23:09:15
What is wrong with a good shitpost every once and awhile :)
@_date: 2018-07-12 16:53:48
Five figures as in 10,000+ BTC? Baller!

Try setting up a node. Make some payment. Send feedback to the appropriate dev teams (on slack or gitub). They are very receptive to bug reports.
@_date: 2018-07-17 20:12:32
I want to see a frontpage crammed with 9K shitposts this week :)
@_date: 2018-03-18 03:19:59
And for the record, I have been an active tester on some of the projects listed.
@_date: 2018-07-20 21:36:57
.1% increase in total supply.
They will be unearthing old harddrives full of BTC in the future. 
@_date: 2018-07-21 00:40:18
Can confirm. Worked for HP. The Secret Service made us put yellow dots on everything. 
@_date: 2019-09-22 19:21:27
About tree fiddy to one.
@_date: 2019-09-04 23:08:35
Just a clarification:
Loan collateral BTC are held at Gemini. Interest-bearing accounts are not (AFAICT). 
That said, they seem legit. Just worried about doze black swans!
@_date: 2018-07-08 12:58:53
Thanks. You rock! :)
This link seems to be not working (looks like his account was suspended): [
@_date: 2018-07-20 21:29:00
No longer possible for the common man to run his own node on Ethereum. I'll pass.

Wait, I thought we were supposed to be a toxic community? /s
@_date: 2018-04-06 21:40:26
Same experience here. whew
@_date: 2018-07-17 16:44:10
Finding the nonce is "harder" because it takes more "work" to find than logging into Facebook, I guess.
But I mostly agree.
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:21:43
Not entirely true. 
You are also allowed to pay your estimates and file for an extension. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:43:16
Not at all. He openly praises BCH as being superior to BTC.
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:51:19
Yes. Please open source so the iOS apps can leverage the good work you have done.
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:23:15
CA only? Can't wait till OR gets it ;)
@_date: 2018-04-23 23:35:13
EDA is in BCASH. It ain't in the whitepaper so Roger can go F himself.

Holding since 2012. 
Haven't sold a single coin from that era. Call me crazy!
@_date: 2018-04-04 22:43:12
Go for it bro!!!
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:09:38
It already does work.  I bought stuff on Bitrefill last week using Lightning Network.
Is it perfect? Nope! Had plenty of failures too. Reminds me when the internet first started up. We had all kinds of crazy issues at first.
@_date: 2018-04-26 07:45:13
Um, place Prince Vitalik in cuffs and watch ETH implode. Too bad ETH is centralized. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 18:24:09
My dad got caught up in this scam. Tried to buy BTC but got BCH instead.
Nice thing is, my father works for the FBI. This fraud is definitely on their radar now.
@_date: 2018-04-13 16:24:32
But Roger Veer tolt me lightning don't work. He even has video of it not working once!
@_date: 2018-04-11 19:54:52
Looks more like a liquidity issue (I'm only speculating).
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:56:34
Yes, let's also increase ethernet's MTU to &gt; 1500 bytes instead of working on higher level protocols. 
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:51:34
Really? Can you please reference the PR you are referring to? Otherwise I think you are incorrect.
@_date: 2019-05-07 19:50:15
Love and hate are different sides of the same coin.
The true opposite of love is indifference, which Warren is not at all. Telling...
@_date: 2019-05-16 17:13:30
The internet has 7 layers and seems to be doing OK. I think merging layer 1 and layer two kills the nice abstraction separate layers gives you.

All your moneez. And don't forget getting a HELOC.
@_date: 2019-05-16 17:14:28
Tell them they need to have a chinese magnet on their arm when they buy them or the transaction won't happen.
@_date: 2018-12-30 13:04:03
Vermin allegedly  paid purse.io way more than 1.25 MM to get BCH on that platform. 
@_date: 2019-05-16 17:15:24
Altszn is a nice way to get more real crypto (btc). But it is still market timing. Good luck
@_date: 2019-05-16 17:17:40

Between 0 and 5MM.
