Come on man, be respectful! This is a war we are talking about.... People are dying!
Wait sorry... No one is dying, it's just that Bitcoin is not working...
Wait sorry... Bitcoin is working, just not very good...
Wait sorry... Bitcoin is just fine right now...
Wait sorry... For listening to this podcast... :/
