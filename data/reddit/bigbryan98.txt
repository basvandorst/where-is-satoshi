Thanks for considering the Billfodl.  Please let me know if you have any questions about it or securing your 24 word seed!  We're always happy to help.

yes, that has been fixed, the balls wont fall through anymore.  
The physics were completely redone by  (on twitter).

 once the smoke comes out, it is very difficult to gather and put back in.

We updated [Bitbonkers.com]( (now at [Billfodl.com/bitbonkers]( to display coinjoin TXs as a white ball with Question marks.  Also, all balls are sized relative to their actual transaction amount.  Lastly, a more robust set of info is available if you click on any block or ball, to include input and output addresses and amounts.  Curious to hear thoughts from the community on the update.
HODL Strong!

Will do Vake!   Christmas/NY break was crazy busy, but you can expect tweets for all the new episodes from here on out.    Thanks for helping us spread the word.

I have a C-lightning node on mainnet, it was a bit of a chore to get setup, with some trial and error, but I have been pretty happy with it thus far.

soooo cool

Something like: enter query value = x
Click node 1
Click node 2
Display all the different ways to send 1 x 2 in different colors
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:31:47
ya, I can see that.  Even in its current state, Nodes going offline does mess things up, however, you always have the option to open a channel directly with the receiver

being banned from banks in india is almost like being banned from moneygram in the US... no one uses it

Oh man... I wish I could.  It always sounds like a blast

good ole' paul.  If your a podcast listener, I highly recommend contra Krugman with Bob Murphy and Tom Woods

What is your node?
@_date: 2018-04-23 22:47:37
That's a good idea, but I still think line thickness might be better, with some floating value below which your channel is completely invisible without clicking on the node.  
On second thought, the beads idea is good but I  still think it needs to incorporate the &gt;= value setting to incentivize ppl to put real value in and declutter the visuals

However, Unlike BTC nodes, which will never make any money by themselves,  if there is enough traffic, LN Nodes can be self sustaining.  You can run a pruned node for about $30-40/month on a VM, so its not too high of a bar for it to become self sustaining.

I've got some Zimbabwe 100 Trillion notes laying around somewhere....  The number of zeros is pretty hilarious... if your not having to actually use the money.

I'm pretty sure if you called them, you'd find out really quickly that they are the part of the "many"

Thanks sosteady.  Obviously, we are glad you think so, but we're mainly just excited about helping people secure there seeds and SKs in a more durable manner.  We want to help the ecosystem grow bigger and stronger.  Everyone has talents they can bring to help.

I saw this on twitter... pretty cool.  I'm mildly optimistic fees can stay reasonable during the next upswing.  
@_date: 2018-04-23 08:56:14
Truth!  That's OG.
@_date: 2018-04-19 20:34:07
Pretty sweet.  Nice job Jesse.  Is CA that much better though?
@_date: 2018-04-23 19:40:30
as a node owner, I will say that the active channels are a bit deceiving, most are for &lt; $0.25, so don't have alot of capacity to transmit value.  Obviously, the market will decide what is needed, but it seems to me that it would be more useful to have fewer channels of higher capacity/channel.  
I think most of the current channels are from people wanting their node to look more important on visual node explorers.  
It would be cool if the explorers would change the line width to account for capacity, thereby visually allowing people to see where it was possible to send certain amounts of value.  If this were the case, 95% of the current channels would probably not be viable.

Thats awesome...  Reminds me of Denis Leary in this spoof...

I've been lurking around r/bitcoin for awhile, but this is my first post.  As far as I know, the thesis behind this is original.  Has anyone else seen a comparison like this?

I'm proud to say that we had our first LN purchase yesterday.  It was crazy how fast the payment came in and really cool that it came from a Mobile wallet.  
The LN is still very finicky, and in its current state requires alot of patience on the part of the customer and merchant, but you can really see the future potential when you use it.  I think these UX problems will be smoothed out fairly quickly (Nicholas Dorier and the BTCPayServer project are at the forefront of this), and we already have it on mobile.  Crazy!
