I was thinking something educational. Or something done up that lead them to a site with information. Coiny - LOL

Where are you based? Personally I like to stay domestically based with my exchanges. If you're in the US, Gemini is a great option.

Anyone know what altcoins Keepkey supports? Saw the statement on their site, but no associated info
@_date: 2016-08-10 01:46:07
My fault, I read your text wrong. I thought you were saying how would coinbase know if a deposit 'in general' was happening. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 00:32:47
Coinbase would be able to see this... Sigh

Does this apply to any fiat balance as well? i.e. If you are trading, holding fiat for any time and there's an issue, is that a hot wallet or cold wallet balance?

Any idea how long the withdrawal time on Paypal would be? Takes an insanely long time for a bank, so this would be helpful if it was more instantaneous

OMG can't wait. Ratings to the moon!
@_date: 2016-06-23 02:26:04
I'd wait to see for at least a few days. Play the range game if you must and buy slightly above the bottom of the 24-48 hr range
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:22:59
This is huge news and great data, upvote!!
@_date: 2016-06-18 20:12:43
Yep, couldn't agree more. It's a digital version that saves them money, but essentially the same system we have now. 
@_date: 2016-06-29 02:41:07
The situation would be more Great Depression like, not post-apocalyptic. If North Korea nukes the world then we're hunting for food and slaughtering each other. If the USD, etc drops to 0 people steal food and push each other out of line for soup

American exchanges ftw!!
@_date: 2016-06-22 16:37:07
Agreed, I'd be super careful. Gonna get some huge fees and interest if your credit card is charging it as a cash advance
@_date: 2016-06-24 02:49:40
To that degree we likely can't imagine where crypto will be in 11 years because so much in society will have changed with its use already
@_date: 2016-06-23 00:17:33
Thanks, couldn't find it! Fee is too high for me anyway
@_date: 2016-06-02 06:11:11
Cool, saw this when I googled something similar - here's the issue though: I'm getting an error message when I click on anything that says the network "Cloudfare" is unable to process my request. Its a website host. Any ideas?
@_date: 2016-06-22 16:41:42
@_date: 2016-06-16 20:59:00
Certainly these are assumptions, but you can't outlaw bitcoin in any legal form. Even if all countries came together you still cannot get rid of it i.e. Drugs, violence, etc 
If anything, they'll tax the shit out of it like they do marijuana now and push people to their currency that way. I know the fear you have, I had it at one point, but you have to consider the government's motivation AND goals. If all that matters is money, banning bitcoin is contradictory to that goal and their motivations. 
As for the "bigger, faster, stronger" argument look at credit cards. Credit cards create new debt on top of the government's own. It's money that is created via interest that is separate from what bank's are loaning. 
You can't do the same core thing and expect a different outcome.

That nicely discounted qp went faster than Coinbase does is what I'm hearing?

Any idea if this site is legit?
@_date: 2016-06-16 17:00:13
This is pointless to fix bigger problems imho. All you're doing is taking the fiat on-chain, which decreases costs for the banking sector globablly, but you're not fixing many problems with the inflation of fiat currencies themselves. 
Enter the US (who will probably be late to crypto-fiat game at this point). They create the USD-Coin... which is still inherently backed by the USD. As they continue to print more USD you have the same issue as the original gold standard i.e. more fiat is 'prtined/created' than there is actual gold. (Re: There is more USD than there is actual USD-Coin.)
Crypto-Fiat is just the next sub-par kick-the-problem-down-the-road solution to the current monetary system's man-made flaws.

Don't have a link, getting info from someone reliable on unlisted sites. Did see this on the eth page though. Not sure of source, legitimacy, etc. am just curious if anyone is seeing/hearing anything. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 03:02:15
Tl,dr whats the latest?
@_date: 2016-12-20 04:01:49
Serious question: How does someone with cash from growing or selling legal marijuana gain access to large amounts of bitcoin? 
If a grower is making $300,000 per year for example, the ability to store a majority of this cash in bitcoin is difficult from what I can see. 
In order to purchase even half of that ($150,000) worth of bitcoin would most efficiently be done on an exchange (smaller fees, real time pricing, etc. etc.) - yes or no? The problem here is that a bank account is needed to deposit USD into an exchange and banks will not accept this 'tainted' money. I don't see Coinbase or Gemini taking duffel bags full of cash at their office anytime soon...
Thoughts or solutions?

Depends on what you're doing on the exchanges. If you're trading, Bitstamp partners with Tradingview, which is nice (BUT they charge fees for making a market). 
Otherwise Kraken is your best bet imho.
@_date: 2016-10-12 13:44:05
How can you know this?
@_date: 2016-10-12 20:32:47
I read that the commission has up to 90 days to approve or disapprove, and the 21 and 35 day marks are for comments.
EDIT: From document...
"III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action
Within 45 days of the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register or within
such longer period up to 90 days (i) as the Commission may designate if it finds such longer
period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the selfregulatory
organization consents, the Commission will: (a) by order approve or disapprove such
proposed rule change; or (b) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change
should be disapproved."

It looks like you can't make the market and avoid fees though executing an auction-only limit order? 
@_date: 2016-10-12 21:12:44

Can you rephrase? Not following or seeing on that link
@_date: 2016-10-13 12:46:36
Ah yes, makes so much sense. Goofy question ;/
@_date: 2016-10-10 03:46:23
One idea would be to buy slowly ($50 per week for ex) so youre best able to get an averaged value of your new asset across time. If you use all your savings next week to buy bitcoin, and the following week the price drops by $100, you're not 'averaging' the cost of this new investment. 
@_date: 2016-05-29 22:47:01
Asking myself that now... Somehow I trust them more, as I prefer an American based company due to all sorts of unknown future regulation, country to country. With such a lack of customer support though I need to look elsewhere. If not Gemini, you'd suggest Kraken?
@_date: 2016-05-31 03:28:37
Are you referring to instant buy on coinbase? Only a $250 limit rn with them last time I checked, for debit cards. Otherwise its no different from your usd wallet on coinbase or the exchange - right?
@_date: 2016-10-12 20:27:03

Sure, but that doesn't explain the huge lack of volume, right? Short term traders wait for squeezes all the time, myself included.
@_date: 2016-05-29 22:05:56
Yeah not in my state yet, but at this point looking forward to it
@_date: 2017-07-06 04:31:34
THIS. But tell them it was legit and hope they don't want transaction details. 
You could also say you bought it through an exchange that was licensed but no longer exists? Idk. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 04:28:51
I wouldn't say it was LBC. If the seller hasn't registered appropriately you'll have bought it from someone selling it illegally - which can't be good for buying a house. I would just tell them it's from investing in cryptocurrency/Bitcoin.

The last episode he set Joe up with a wallet at which point Joe then donated all of the Joe-Rogan-donated bitcoin people sent him for nothing. Joe and Andreas raised 10k+ for a great cause, supporting Justin Wren and his pursuit of freedom for a race of pygmys that are enslaved and tortured in somewhere like Papa New Guinea (?). 
Joe's original concerns in their first podcast together were legal ones because he's admitted he knows nothing about finance and doesn't keep up with it.

So if I have a limit of $50k for withdrawals right now do I have to reapply for that limit at any time to maintain it?
@_date: 2016-07-01 14:09:43
If shit hits the fan in any imaginable or unimaginable way and you have more than 10k in their service at that time it could present serious problems to your overall monetary balance. 
It decreases your liquidity in a world where bitcoin derives a lot of it's inherent value from its high liquidity. 
@_date: 2016-07-01 17:55:37
Thanks for the help, will definitely do that. Why the limit in general though? Kind of frustrating. 
@_date: 2016-07-04 17:28:48
Done with Coinbase as well. Between this and the withdrawal limits that "exist, but not really" according to their reddit rep, its becoming clear Coinbase cares less about their customers and more about the # of cnbc interviews they're taking. Sigh. 
@_date: 2016-07-01 01:47:00
Yeah they're just not based in the US and I prefer something located in the US for a variety of reasons. Have tried Kraken and Gemini but don't like their UI/UX like I do Coinbase/GDAX. Now with this bullshit I feel like it's a must to avoid Coinbase/GDAX though. 
Another step towards 'Coinbase Bank' if you ask me. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 16:22:02
At some point yes, but not sure about right before or right after.

So it's fair to say the community, etc. isn't stopping the scaling conversation with this single victory? As someone who used to own bitcoin but no longer does due to scalability issues, these goals sound great.
