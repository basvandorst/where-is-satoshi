You think governments of the world would be capable of coordinating together to shut down bitcoin? They can't even achieve consensus on the existential threat of climate change I don't think they will all simply agree to shut down magic internet money.


And at one point kings ruled the world. Shit changes and a lot of that 'old money' was because those people adapted to large scale shifts in society that they benefited from. 


Institutions already feel the threat. They are adopting the tech but centralizing the authority is the antithesis to cryptocurrencies. Without distributed consensus all you have is a fancy linked list database. Crypto is the cross over of tech, political and economical ideology that you can't simply cherry pick from and have the same benefits.


Were you not around for the crash of 2008?
