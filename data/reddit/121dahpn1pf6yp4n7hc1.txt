I agree with you.
Small parenthesis, if I were to buy bitcoins instead of the asics with the money I spent on the avalons at the time I got the avalons I'd probably have more bitcoins in the end than with the avalon + mining.
Plus it makes me feel like constantly gambling, I wake up and check how many btc have I done and what pools should I use, and this is far from healthy.
TL;DR Mining is complicated (even if you have strong computer skills) and stressing and unless you have free power or managed to get hold of lots of asics for cheap you won't make big profits.

or heated place. Avoid burning them.

I don't buy this. If the NSA has anything to do with BTC it won't necessarily leak. They don't need many people to stay silent on this.
@_date: 2013-07-10 16:30:12
Yes. However, with the difficulty increase and enough bad luck I may end up with MUCH less than would I could have with a pool.
Do you know of any pool with truly 0 fees ?

I don't think it's impossible for the NSA to control bitcoin by raw computer power or even by some smarter algorithm/bug/backdoor but that's besides the point.
What I'm trying to say is that they don't need to use raw computing power or some technical solution, they just need to manipulate by economic means which is well within their power as well as exchanges, payment processors, etc

Yeah - that's the box running eloipool + bitcoind.
The faster the better.
This is so that I can solo mine with avalon[s].
I have about 140/150 Gh/s available and solo is within my range but I have not been lucky yet on solo/private pool.
@_date: 2013-07-10 17:58:04
You can join mine maybe :)
@_date: 2013-07-11 10:07:14
Only USA you think ? What about UK, Israel, the whole Nato and EU possibly if they could pressure them somehow.
On the other hand they could just block bitcoind traffic in all the big nodes by using transatlantic pacts and international agreements.
Or they'd just ignore it, who knows.

If you installed shit software on your computer expect to have keyloggers and other malware steal your bitcoin whether local or on some scummy easycoin.net

Ok given the interest I decided to dedicate 25% to p2pool and the rest on eloipool private pool mining.
Tomorrow I'll switch back to some bigger pools from eloipool if I get no blocks..
@_date: 2013-07-10 11:26:33
I was hoping to get 1 a week with 150 ghs or 1 every 12 days with 80 ghs 
@_date: 2013-07-11 07:51:21
great than give us the transaction id so we can have a look around ?
@_date: 2013-07-10 21:24:09
trying now with the p2pool avalon git branch and --fix-protocol option on avalon. The stats and graphs of p2pool are better than logs than eloipool provides.
@_date: 2013-07-10 12:12:20
Don't know, I have batch 2 avalon and it costed me around 2000 $ back when I ordered but now you can't order them anymore.
@_date: 2013-07-10 16:28:28
Doesn't work as well with avalons, not many people use this approach,
Unless I missed some bitcointalk forum post ?
@_date: 2013-07-11 12:55:04
Can you imagine a day in which bitcoin is as used or more than paypal and everyone is happy that we have more choice and a democratic currency ?
Yet all the mining or block creation for fees will eventually be centralized by countries or even groups/individuals which can mine for a profit.
And no accountability ..
@_date: 2013-07-10 16:27:05


Why? 
@_date: 2013-07-11 12:57:28
it's good but too bad shipping limited to the states
@_date: 2013-07-10 10:11:58
At the moment 25 + fees, but this gets halved every few years, more details on the bitcoin wiki.
@_date: 2013-07-10 09:30:57
I can and I did for a bit, it's a compromise and yes it does increase the time it takes on avg to get a block to over 15 days.
I need luck!
EDIT: I can split with Load Balance or Balance and I'm not sure which one would be better.
@_date: 2013-07-10 20:08:55
yeah do you know anyone using it with avalons ?
@_date: 2013-07-11 07:53:11
A player can be a controller if this player is stronger than any other player and we know the NSA is one of the big big players and the top 5 is made of almost exclusively allies.
It's not a fair game
