It's an ETN not an ETF, and they recently increased their annual fee from 1 to 2.5 %, so I look forward to the Winklevoss ETF because it may offer lower fees.
But there is talk in this Reddit thread that only "accredited traders" (you have to prove that your net worth is at least 1 million USD) will be allowed to trade the ETF. So if this is true, then I'll have to keep paying the 2.5 % annual fee to XBT Provider because of my low net worth.

I wouldn't go that far. It's more like they're "slowly suffocating it" by not giving it the air (2 MB hard fork) it needs to survive. I think there's still a 50-50 chance of survival, if Bitcoin is given the needed air sooner rather than later. But if the Bitcoin Core developers keep strangling it, then eventually another cryptocurrency that is not being strangled will take over the lead and [network effect](
I still have hope for Bitcoin Classic winning the currently ongoing governance and scaling road map election before another cryptocurrency gets more adoption and Bitcoin is forgotten by everyone except by specialized historians.
You small blockers say with more and more confidence that the economic majority are also small blockers. That's easy to think and say when most large blockers have either been banned from the subreddit forum or self-censored and moved to voluntarily. Who the economic majority finally elects can be seen in real-time on the Bitcoin blockchain. We big blockers [currently have about 5 % of the votes (Bitcoin Classic BIP109)]( We only need 70 more percent and then the hard fork and governance change will activate and 28 days later, happen.
May the fork be with you.

Myspace is also still alive. But it stopped growing and most new users chose Facebook instead of choosing Myspace. Being alive is not sufficient. You must keep growing to remain relevant in a highly competitive environment such as social networks or cryptocurrencies. 
The question is whether Bitcoin will be compared to the story of Facebook or Myspace in the future history books. Will Bitcoin have enough capacity to grow sufficiently compared to eager competition? I guess time will tell. 
The current 3-7 (depending on how you count) transactions per second can not be enough for worldwide adoption. My opinion is that we need more on chain capacity than that for Bitcoin to not just survive but also reach an adoption level similar to that of Facebook.

@_date: 2015-12-19 12:52:21
Practically everyone who is a BIP101 proponent (including Gavin) would prefer the initial cap increase to be 20 MB and not 8 MB. The only reason Gavin changed the BIP101 to a 8 MB initial cap increase was because a large number of Chinese miners released a signed paper document where they insisted that they wanted 8 MB. 
So as a compromise with the preferences of the Chinese miners, Blockstream and the Bitcoin Core developers, we (BIP101 proponents) would agree to a 8 MB initial cap increase instead of the originally proposed 20 MB.
If the Chinese miners can't handle (stay reasonably competitive with international miners) 8 MB due to low national bandwidth capacity, then they'll just have to adapt to the new conditions like every other miner constantly does. If the Chinese miners don't find a practical way to solve their national bandwidth capacity problem, they could in their worst case scenario simply move their mining data centers to be located in countries with a more competitive bandwidth capacity. 
That scenario would actually increase miner decentralization because now almost all mining occurs within the Chinese national borders due to electricity being competitively priced in China compared to most places in the rest of the world. Such a physical move of their miner data centers would be a normal thing. Google's Youtube servers for example are hosted physically in data centers all over the world. Just because Google, the company that owns the Youtube servers, is located inside the USA national borders, doesn't mean that their actual servers are also all located inside the USA national borders. 
The worst case scenario for the Chinese miners would be a minor inconvenience that happens all the time to other businesses that operate and grow while being connected to the global internet to serve an international user base. They would be at no competitive disadvantage if they would move their physical data center and spread it out to multiple data centers across the other nations of the world. No more than Google has a disadvantage for their multiple Youtube data centers. 
Of course the Chinese miners would prefer that all mining stays within the Chinese national borders, because they currently have a significant competitive advantage with Chinese electricity being very cheap compared to other nations' prices. But the Bitcoin network consists of more actors than just Chinese miners. We have exchanges, payment processors, non-Chinese miners, merchants, wallet providers, node developers, and the actual ordinary users of the currency too. 
When the Bitcoin network and the economic majority outgrows the Chinese national bandwidth capacity, the Chinese miners will have to adapt to the growth by either finding ways to improve their bandwidth situation while keeping their data centers inside of China, or simply move their data centers to other countries with a more competitive bandwidth capacity.
Such a move, should it prove to be practically actually necessary, would only be good for mining decentralization anyway. The economic majority needs this increase in transactions per second capacity, and the low bandwidth miners will have to upgrade their internet connections to accommodate that need. If the ecosystem as a whole chooses not to upgrade the tps capacity, one of the altcoins will do it, and then they'll take the lead away from Bitcoin, crashing the exchange rate for bitcoin, severely decreasing the profit for everyone involved in Bitcoin including the Chinese miners. 
So this tps cap from today's 3-7 tps must increase even when that requires a large max block size cap increase. The network participants, including the Chinese miners, will have to and are going to adapt to this very good problem. It's a good problem became it means that Bitcoin adoption is increasing.

I don't get offended if someone calls me a "big blockist". I see nothing wrong with being called that. I'm a "big block size limit proponent", so it seems like a logical and relevantly descriptive name to call me.
A slower *block* propagation time would not affect 0-conf tx's to become slower. The block is sent only once every 10 min on average, while the 0-conf tx is sent continuously even when the bandwidth isn't being used in a burst mode. 
So no, a double spend would still be equally detectable equally fast, even with a much higher block propagation time. You don't have to wait for a block to have been created before you're able to detect a double spend attempt. That only takes less than 10 seconds in the network as it is today without Full RBF (for smaller valued transactions than let's say 100 USD, admittedly retrieved from out of my behind).

Wow, take it easy with the attitude dude. Just imagine if the same question would've been asked to Satoshi Nakamoto when he first published his white paper. With people like you, we wouldn't have had Bitcoin at all today. Feel free to ignore his proposal if you only read proposals from accredited celebrity figures. The rest of the network participants will find a solution to this disagreement on how to scale Bitcoin, with or without your attitude.
Sure, the author could've included a short "Abstract" section at the top of his paper / BIP. But if you would have spent just 3 minutes skimming through the paper, you would've found the very short "The Proposal" section instead. That section is sufficient to serve as a basis for deciding if you'd want to spend more than the already spent 3 minutes to read the rest of his BIP. Personally, I think his proposal is worth reading and I don't regret that I've read it. Here, I'll include the section below for your convenience.

I've seen you small-blockists repeatedly make this claim but no one ever shows how "easy" it is in a real life situation. So, show us how you use your own tool to make a double spend by recording a screencast of the process and uploading that video to youtube. I bet you can't make a successful double spend transaction after 10 seconds have passed. If your first transaction is received and propagated by the network, your second double spend transaction will be ignored by the network, even if you send it manually to all the miners directly (after ten seconds have passed since the first transaction).

Some people fear and predict that there are going to be fewer and fewer computers in the future. That reminds me of the Chairman of IBM in 1943, who allegedly said:
"I think there is a world market for maybe five computers." - Thomas J. Watson (Chairman of the Board of International Business Machines), 1943.
(Assuming that the [disputed quote]( is actually true and not just made up.)
There are far more than just five computers in the world today, and I'd guess that there'd be far more than five Bitcoin nodes in the future as well. There is no need to fear BIP101 in regards to centralization of nodes, in my opinion.
Even if only 5 % of all bitcoin users are running their own nodes today, there will still be twice as many total nodes running, if we adopt BIP101 and (as a result of cheaper transactions) get 10 times as many users but only 1 % of the future users run their own node.
You can verify my math above by assuming 100 000 Bitcoin users today.
5 % of 100 000 users is 5 000 nodes.  
10 times 100 000 users is 1 000 000 users.  
1 % of 1 000 000 users is 10 000 nodes.  
10 000 nodes is twice as much as 5 000 nodes.
10 000 nodes is better than 5 000 nodes, even if the system is technically more centralized than before (1 % run nodes instead of 5 %). In real terms, the system becomes more decentralized anyway (10 000 nodes are being run instead of 5 000 nodes).

My guess is that Bitcoin XT proponents will find this BIP to have a growth rate that is too small and that they will not accept it. They will probably accept BIP101 and keep advocating that proposal instead.
The Bitcoin Core proponents will likely accept this BIP202 proposal as it's advocating a cap growth that is even slower than [Adam Back's "2-4-8" proposal]( at least for the first four years. Adam Back is the President and co-founder of the Blockstream company that officially employs nine of the Bitcoin Core most active developers. So my guess is that Adam Back is going to find BIP202 acceptable, and therefore his employees and Bitcoin Core will also find the proposal acceptable.
My guess is that no compromise will be reached between Bitcoin Core proponents and Bitcoin XT proponents (Bitcoin XT proponents believe that the 8 MB BIP101 is already a compromise from the original 20 MB BIP101.), and after the transaction fees have gone up significantly due to the 1 MB current cap, enough of the economic majority are going to announce their support for BIP101. 
Once they have announced that support publically, two things may happen: 1. Bitcoin Core accepts and implements BIP101 and no fork will happen, or 2. The economic majority will go ahead and start running the Bitcoin XT fork of Bitcoin Core. Once 75 % of the miners have started mining BIP101 blocks, the fork will activate "for real" and there will very briefly (for up to a few hours maybe) be two separate Bitcoin networks running at the same time. Once this has happened, the smaller fork's users are going to very quickly join the larger fork's network because that is where all the future value is going to be. The smaller network will be abandoned.
The Bitcoin Core developers and proponents don't believe that this scenario will happen, because if they did believe it, then they would have already implemented BIP101 into Bitcoin Core and we would not be having this debate. They believe that the economic majority is going to remain proponents of Bitcoin Core and whatever BIP that Bitcoin Core is going to implement in regard to the block size cap debate.
Whatever happens to the max block size cap growth, will have happened before 2017-01-01 and maybe even a few months before that. This debate cannot go on forever and decisions will be made. The number of transactions are growing steadily and exponentially. The longer the decisions are postponed, the more expensive the transaction fees are going to become. The larger the transaction fees become, the larger will the pressure to reach a final growth plan decision become. Right now, the transaction fees are still not much higher than what they have always been. But pressure is rising which will lead to decisions. Within a year, is my personal guess.
Disclosure: I'm a BIP101, Bitcoin XT and FSS RBF proponent so my analysis of what is going to happen in the future is biased to that effect. No one knows what is going to happen in the future, and that certainly includes me. This is my guess however, and I'm using that as a basis for my personal investment decisions. Everyone is responsible for making their own analysis and don't blame me if I'm wrong with mine. Don't base your investment decisions on what random and anonymous guys (like me) have written on the internet, etc. Good luck!

For some of my savings, actually yes I would (I assume you meant "offering", not "charging".). Why? Well, I don't feel comfortable holding all of my savings myself directly and value the possibility to have a bank holding some of my savings on my behalf as well. Even if they offer me negative interest rates to do so. 
Of course, if the negative interest rates would become as horrible as the inflation for the Zimbabwian Dollar back in 2008, I would not store any of my savings in a bank. But I've lived with a lower interest rate than actual inflation for many years now, so introducing a small negative interest rate to me today would not make much difference in actual money from year to year.
It's easy to accidentally lose your real bitcoin in various ways if you store them yourself, no matter how careful you are. I recognize and freely admit my technological know how limits despite being an old geek and think that a reasonable fee, be it in the form of fees or negative interest rates, is acceptable for the benefit of not having all of my eggs in the same basket. Hopefully at least one of my baskets will survive until my retirement.
Everyone is of course free to choose in what way they want to hold bitcoin and other currencies. Some choose 100 % real bitcoin and that is a valid choice, but it is not the choice that I've made for my savings, and that is a valid choice as well. We just view risk differently and that is ok. I'm clumsy and even have backups of my backups, so for me it makes sense not to trust myself to 100 %. I lost all of the eggs I had stored in Mtgox for example, so I acknowledge that my way of thinking has it's disadvantages as well :P.

**Bitcoin Blockchain adoption is a good thing for bitcoin the currency.**
The more ways that the Bitcoin Blockchain can be used (1. Colored Coins representing ownership of company stocks instead of representing actual bitcoin, 2. timestamping hashes of data instead of using a relatively expensive human notary for that, 3. storing domain name ownership information on top of the Bitcoin Blockchain like Namecoin does natively, etc), the more protection bitcoin the currency will get from governments and their appointed authorities that want to shut the currency down. It would also get protection from legacy banks that want to shut down bitcoin the currency for merely being a rapidly growing competitor to the legacy financial system.
Imagine if we reach a time in the evolution of the Bitcoin project where there are 10 additional use cases for transacting data on the Bitcoin Blockchain that doesn't represent bitcoin the currency transactions. If a government would like to shut down bitcoin the currency for whatever reason du jour, they would also have to shut down all of the other 9 use cases for the Bitcoin Blockchain. Or they would have to make the other possible choice; not try to shut down any of the 10 use cases, including the "bitcoin the currency" use case. If every of these 10 use cases would depend on the exact same Bitcoin Blockchain, then they would in effect each protect each other. If you shut down the Bitcoin Blockchain, you'll also be shutting down everything that has been built on top of the Bitcoin Blockchain. A government would have to consider such a shut down's effect on the society as a whole. 
Now imagine if one of those use cases were using the Bitcoin Blockchain as a tamper-proof governmental registry for citizen house and land property ownership. A government would be much less likely to try to shutdown bitcoin the currency if they were themselves using the same Bitcoin Blockchain for their own purposes.
Now I'll admit that the Bitcoin project doesn't seem to need this additional protection considering how surprisingly friendly most nations' governments have demonstrated to be so far. But I still think it's worth a lot to add this extra layer of protection, if for no other reason that it will speed up the usage adoption when people new to Bitcoin feel that their bitcoin holdings would be much more protected against attempted shut downs. 
Almost every new Bitcoin user I've met so far has had this as one of their very first questions about the system: "But why don't governments just shut the whole Bitcoin system down if it's so useful to criminals of all kinds?". A person that still thinks that there is a significant risk of governmental Bitcoin shut down is not very likely to adopt the currency any time soon. If we could answer "The government could, but that would also mean they would lose their own house and property database in the process, so they won't.", then adoption of bitcoin the currency would increase faster.
So, why does increasing the speed of adoption of bitcoin the currency matter? Well, the world outside of Bitcoin doesn't stand still while Bitcoin is getting adopted. There are competing systems and there is a race of who gets the most adoption the fastest. Very few people use the "Google+" social network instead of Facebook, mostly because Facebook happened to get user adoption the fastest. Being first matters, in cases such as these.
**Conclusion and tldr:**
If we would want Bitcoin to become the de facto cryptocurrency (and the primary world reserve currency) that the world uses, then we must also care about the speed of which user adoption occurs. With many use cases additional to the "bitcoin the currency" use case, user adoption rate will increase.

This is BIP66:
This document specifies proposed changes to the Bitcoin transaction validity rules to restrict signatures to strict DER encoding.
Bitcoin's reference implementation currently relies on OpenSSL for signature validation, which means it is implicitly defining Bitcoin's block validity rules. Unfortunately, OpenSSL is not designed for consensus-critical behaviour (it does not guarantee bug-for-bug compatibility between versions), and thus changes to it can - and have - affected Bitcoin software.
One specifically critical area is the encoding of signatures. Until recently, OpenSSL's releases would accept various deviations from the DER standard and accept signatures as valid. When this changed in OpenSSL 1.0.0p and 1.0.1k, it made some nodes reject the chain.

Sure, but ideally I'd also want to be able to sign from each public address that is available to me in my wallet. The way you're describing it, I would only be able to have one possible identity per phone. I wouldn't want any insignificant site to use my "root identity". I'd like the possibility to have more than one identity where each identity is not possible to connect to any of the other identities. 
I also have several non-HD-addresses in my Mycelium app that I'd like to be able to use separately from each other.
It's a useful, easy to use and cool first step, but there is also a possibility to improve upon the idea.

BIP101 actually increases the max blocksize cap in small steps, once for every new block that is created. It doesn't give a sudden "supply shock" once every two years. The cap doubling once every two years is just what happens due to the very many very small increases.

Do you have access to an ordinary stock trading account? If yes, then maybe your stock broker has access to the XBT Provider "Bitcoin Tracker One" bitcoin certificate on the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange. If you'd buy that certificate instead of "real" bitcoin, the risk of losing bitcoin wouldn't depend on your technical knowledge, but would depend on their technical knowledge. 
The fee is currently 2.5 % per year. Maybe their fee will go down if and when the Winkelvoss ETF "COIN" gets released and starts competing with the "Bitcoin Tracker One" certificate. So if you don't feel comfortable taking personal responsibility for storing your "real" bitcoin, the certificate or future ETF may be an option you could consider.

While I agree that issuing such a bounty would be a cool use of the Bitcoin technology, I however don't agree with the statement that 0-conf tx's that are 10 seconds (and with a monetary value of less than let's say 100 USD) or older are *practically* unsafe in today's version of the network. So if a bitcoin user pays for a meal or a cup of to-go coffee, the double spend transaction is not going to succeed. Full RBF is neither needed nor wanted by us users.
Full RBF just kills this use case with no benefit to us users. FSS RBF is ok, so go implement that if you are worried about trigger happy users who accidentally send a tx with a too low fee and wish to increase the fee retroactively. But don't kill the 0-conf use case by implementing Full RBF, even if it's "just opt-in". 
Once the functionality has been included and deployed, there will be only a very small decision away from enabling an additional switch to let miners opt-in for *all* transactions and not just those that have been explicitly tagged as Full RBF by the senders. It only takes one big miner to "opt-in for *all* transactions" and then 0-conf tx's will have become even *practically*, not just *theoretically* useless.
You wrote this just a few hours ago:


Source: 
This is the first time I hear of this argument to want to implement Full RBF into the Bitcoin Core software. This could be a valid reason because everyone seems to agree that LN would be good to implement. But if Full RBF is actually really necessary for LN to be able to work, then the community should be allowed to take a vote: Do you want to 1) keep FSS RBF as the only offered option and sacrifice LN, or do you want to 2) implement Full RBF as the default option for all transactions so you can get LN but sacrifice 0-conf transactions.
Personally, I would vote to keep FSS RBF and / or CPFP RBF and sacrifice the future LN. You can still code LN and show a demo in a test-net, and we can take a vote again after we have seen it working in a test environment. But LN doesn't even exist yet, so it would be strange to kill practically useful 0-conf tx's that are commonly used today just to *maybe* get a well functioning LN sometime in the future.
In the very same comment that I quoted above, you write this:




So, in order to make LN seem like a very good and desirable product, removing those same features (1. instantly confirmed transactions and 2. small fees) from the existing Bitcoin node software would be needed.  
Because if you leave the existing Bitcoin node software alone as it already is (No Full RBF and a very large max block size), then people would not use LN very much at all. 
Please don't cripple the already existing Bitcoin Core node software just to make LN much more attractive. We can have both (can't we?). I understand that making LN much more attractive earns it's developer Blockstream much more money. But Blockstream can do something else to make a profit for their investors. They don't have to cripple the rest of the Bitcoin Core node software to make a decent profit. It's better to make a decent profit but with good odds of success, than to make incredible profits but with extreme risk to the entire Bitcoin project. I think that you're taking a serious risk to destroy the whole project by crippling it with the artificial 1 MB block size limit and killing practical 0-conf tx's. 
That would not return a profit to your investors because LN needs Bitcoin to be profitable. What you're doing is killing Bitcoin. Please try to see how what you're doing is not profitable neither for you nor for everyone else. If nothing else, keep very large blocks and FSS / CPFP RBF until *after* you can show a demo of a functioning LN in a test environment. After that, we can all vote if LN is worth to sacrifice very large blocks and practical 0-conf tx's for everyone including for Blockstream and their investors. Is there really no way to implement LN without making these sacrifices? Bitcoin is a risky investment as it is. Please don't make it much more riskier. There is enough potential profit for us all, including for Blockstream.

Why is the processing time quadratic and not just linear? If it takes 30 seconds to verify (hash) 1 MB, then my guess would be that it should take 60 seconds to verify 2 MB. 
That's true when I download a movie with a lot of rar files and run a checksum check on the files. Checking (hashing) 50 rar files takes 50 times as long to check 1 rar file. Why isn't the same true for checking let's say 1000 transactions (1 MB block) compared to checking 2000 transactions (2 MB block)? Why does a doubling of transactions lead to it taking 20 times (10 minutes instead of 30 seconds) as much time to verify them? 
@_date: 2015-06-22 14:45:28
Yes, that is true as well. 
The first transaction with the highest fee had one input and the input was almost a whole month old. The value of the input was ~0.09 xbt (~23 USD).
The second transaction with the lowest fee had one input and the input was 7 days old. The value of the input was also ~0.09 xbt (~23 USD).
The third transaction with the "normal" fee (10 000 satoshis per KB) had two inputs and the first input was less than an hour old (so I suppose it was an output from one of the previous test transactions, since I've only made three transactions today). The value of the input was ~0.005 xbt (~1 USD). The second input also had a value of ~0.005 xbt (~1 USD) but was 7 days old. So I guess the third transaction got a little extra priority from that second 7 days old input.
Also, while looking through the transactions using the Mycelium app, the blockchain.info site that I got redirected to for details got overloaded several times. So at least something broke, but it's quite possible blockchain.info broke for other reasons than this scheduled transaction spam test considering they break every once in a while at random times for random reasons.

Today with a **block size cap at 1 MB** I run a full node on one of my home computers with **no problem**. **If the cap would be raised to 2 MB, I would just as easily be able to run a "50 % node" if my client software would allow me such a configuration setting.** 
**This isn't a "full node or no node at all" situation, is it?** 
If the Bitcoin Core client software would offer a settings option for the amount of participation the user would like to contribute, I don't see any dramatic decrease in "full nodes" on the network. **If you'd add up all the "half nodes" you'd get just as much "node capacity" overall.**
Actually, "full" node participation should *increase* whenever a "participation amount setting" would get implemented in the Bitcoin Core software, because then people who today don't think they have the necessary computer and bandwidth resources to run a full node and therefore don't run a full node at all, would become able to suddenly participate with a "10 %" or maybe even "50 %" node.
In the long run, "node participation" would maybe become more centralized, if the bitcoin network usage would grow faster than Moore's Law. But even with a very large amount of "1 (one) % nodes" instead of today's "100 % nodes", I think that the network should always experience having enough nodes to keep functioning smoothly, efficiently and for all practical purposes be enough decentralized to be secure.

Actually, there has been a surprisingly long delay for the enabling of trading access to other than Swedish banks. So far I've seen only maybe five non-Swedish banks (when I look at my local broker's page:  who have done BT1-trades.

Oh, so you happen to live in Stockholm too? What are the odds, eh. Yes, I've used that ATM (Malmskillnadsgatan 32) just to test it, and it worked properly when I did (It requires you to let the ATM scan your ID card if you want to make a larger transaction, so be sure to have it with you if you plan to do that.). You can only access it during business hours though as it's inside the outer doors of a corporate office building. The guy who manages it is only a few floors up in case something wouldn't work properly or you'd want to ask for help on how to use it or how to store and handle "real" bitcoin properly. He or one of his employees are usually there and at least the manager loves to talk about bitcoin.
Also, you could visit the local meetup group called "Stockholm Satoshi Square". They meet on Mondays in "Kulturhuset" on the bottom floor in a restaurant / cafe area:
I've attended their meetups a couple of times, and they're both friendly and helpful to people who know just a little but are interested in learning more. They also trade bitcoin to and from cash directly from their cell phones. If you chose to buy from them, be sure to ask loudly enough so everyone at the table can hear you (but not loud enough so that the cafe staff or the whole restaurant can hear you): "Is there anyone who can make a better offer than 392 USD / bitcoin?", and watch their reactions. People don't usually do that and accept the first person's offer, but I saw a guy ask a similar question, and yes, he did get a slightly better deal from a guy a few chairs away from him.
Be sure to know how to calculate a reasonable price in SEK, so you don't have to blindly trust your seller when he offers you an exchange rate. I've never seen anyone get tricked, but you don't want to be the first. There is no "membership" to be allowed to be there, so anyone can show up at those meetups.
Usually there are only 2-3 people who have registered themselves as attending, but 5-7 people appear there anyway. People are just lazy to register that they're coming on the meetup site, so there will be enough people to keep interesting conversations going, sometimes even several at a time.
Before you visit either the ATM (just a few blocks away from Kulturhuset) or the meetup, I'd recommend that you download and install either the Mycelium bitcoin wallet app if you're on Android, or the Breadwallet app if you're on Iphone. Play around a little so that you can have more than just a few questions before you meet the people.
Everyone can see everyone in the open restaurant / cafe and it's right across "Plattan" where a lot of weirdos hang around. I don't think they know what bitcoin is, but I'd at least look around a little that I'm not followed when I'm on my way home. So I'd recommend to not bring too much cash with you the first couple of times, just to get a feeling of the situation, the people and your surroundings. You shouldn't even trust me in anything I say. With that said, the regulars at the meetup are just harmless and friendly geeks who happen to have an unusual amount of interest in financial technologies, especially bitcoin.
You'll always get a percentagewise better price if you use an international "real" bitcoin exchange such as Kraken or Bitstamp for example. But that maybe doesn't matter to you if you're only going to buy bitcoin for a smaller amount. But it's good to know so you can take it under consideration in case you decide to buy a larger amount and get comfortable enough to take the risk of taking personal responsibility of handling and storing "real" bitcoin.

The Mycelium wallet only allows a maximum of 20 000 satoshis per KB.

What would you think about a one time and immediate increase of the Bitcoin cap to 4 MB? Would you consider that dangerous? Because if you do, then by the same reasoning you should also consider the existing 1 MB Litecoin cap to be at least equally dangerous, and decide to decrease it to 250 KB in the next version of Litecoin.

What you are describing sounds more like a spread, not a fee. The spread is actually very low, more like 0.10 % than the 2.5 % we are talking about. I know the page is in Swedish, but if you look at the page anyway and scroll down to where it says "spread", you can see that it's very low while Nasdaq Stockholm is open for trading:


As far as I can understand from XBT Provider's homepage, you have actually described exactly how the fee is taken from the share owners. You can see that they have effectually done the exact same calculation as you have in your example calculation.
 (Click on "calculation".)
The fee is taken every day so that it adds up to 2.5 % when a year has passed. So every day, the ticker rate follows the real bitcoin rate a tiny bit less, and after a year, it will follow the real bitcoin rate 2.5 % less, if my attempt at an explanation makes any sense.

As long as your father buys the coins before the fork happens, his coins will remain safe because they will exist on both sides of the fork. After it's become clear which of the two sides has won the scaling conflict, his private keys will remain valid on both blockchains. So I don't understand what it is you're fearing.
I'm betting that the Bitcoin XT with BIP101 side is going to win and that Bitcoin Core is going to lose. But I still haven't sold my cold storage coins, because even if I'm wrong and the Bitcoin Core side wins the conflict, my cold storage coins will still remain completely under my control just as before. No coins will be "lost" no matter which side wins. (With that said, never invest more than you're comfortable losing because investing in Bitcoin is high risk regardless of this fork, etc.)

I lost bitcoin in the Mtgox circus, but I still don't think that blacklisting the stolen coins is a good idea, because that would destroy bitcoin fungibility, which if allowed would eventually kill bitcoin as a whole. Nobody would want to get paid in bitcoin if they didn't know for certain that the bitcoin they are being paid with are theirs to keep.
Imagine the same think happen to cash bills. Let's say a year from now all one hundred dollar bills that were stolen in some bank robbery got blacklisted. Let's say their serial numbers where from 123456 -- 345678. I wouldn't want to be paid in 100 dollar bills, because I wouldn't know for certain which ones may turn out to become blacklisted a year from now. That would make 100 dollar bills worthless, because no one would be able to trust them.
So as you can see, destroying currency fungibility also destroys the currency itself. So no, please don't blacklist neither mine nor anyone elses bitcoins. I still have some left, and I wouldn't want them to also loose their value for me.

It is dated 2013-11-25, and the text is the following:
"Bitstamp status update
Dear Bitstamp clients,
Bitcoin`s staggering growth continues!
Unfortunately, to our mutual displeasure, this growth and other issues have caused problems for some of our customers. These issues include recent problems with our banking software which caused a large backlog of transfers which in turn increased the manual checking that was required by support agents. Additional networking issues also magnified the work required. Altogether our need for additional support agents and hardware has increased dramatically.
Bitstamp works hard to provide the excellent service and in response to these problems, we have upgraded our hardware infrastructure and hired four new support agents. This brings our total employee count to seventeen.
Further, in anticipation of Bitcoin`s continued growth, Bitstamp is hiring more staff members and further improving our hardware infrastructure.
Thank you for your understanding and loyalty.
Best regards,
The Bitstamp team"

Thanks for sharing your analysis of the Mtgox situation. You say that Coinbase may have similar albeit not as grave technical problems. How about Bitstamp? I'd like to keep some of my bitcoins at a secure exchange because I don't fully trust my own technical competence to store my bitcoins securely. I'd store most of my eggs in my own basket, but just in case it turns out I messed up, I'd like to keep at least a few eggs in other people's baskets.

The answer to the problem you're describing is not regulation, it's certification. I as a private citizen would like to have the option to choose between using the services of a bitcoin company that is not certified, and a company that has gotten NY Benjamin Lawsky's certification for example. 
If we would have regulation instead of different certifications, I would not be able to choose the alternative company because that would be illegal. Maybe I too would choose to use the services of say Circle if they could brag about being certified by Benjamin Lawsky's organization because I too remember the pain in losing bitcoins in the Mtgox failure. 
But I would very much like to have the choice to take the same risk again. People who don't know what they're doing could always choose the safe bet and choose a government certified exchange.

The way I understood his statement in context, was that his business literally wasn't allowed to have bank accounts at the three major banks that he applied for, and as a direct consequence was forced to deal in cash-cash transactions instead of bank account-bank account transactions. Probably he means that there is no way accepted by neither the banks nor the government to receive his physical cash as payment for the taxes that his business owes. 
So that is a real problem for him, if it's true that he can't just walk into a governmental tax office and pay his company's owed taxes in cash. I don't know if that's true since I don't live in Canada. Maybe he isn't legally allowed to take his company's physical CAD cash, put it into his personal private account, and then pay the company's owed taxes via his private personal account.

So, yes, it seems to dynamically link to a ssl library, but why the v1.0.0, and not the 1.0.1 version number, that you see when issuing this command?

Also, why are the directories different? The ldd command shows /lib/..., and the openssl version -a command shows /usr/lib/....

Or will the US government simply say to me "Tough luck. You shouldn't have used Mtgox when you should have known that some users there were using Silk Road. It's impossible to determine which coins were used for what, so we are taking yours too."?

Thanks, yeah I know. In Sweden you have to calculate the profit you've made for each purchase even if it's just a lunch at a restaurant, and pay 30 % in taxes for that profit. The Swedish IRS views it as if you've sold bitcoin for fiat even if you just used it to buy a lunch one time. That's the reason I'd like these calculations done automatically in my phone wallet app. I just don't want the IRS penalizing me for buying lunch, even though I personally don't think just using bitcoin as a currency and not as an investment should count as a taxable event.

I don't know, but found an old book through Wikipedia's disambiguation page for the word "Leviathan". The book seems to be connected to your question:


Its name derives from the biblical Leviathan. **The work concerns the structure of society and legitimate government, and is regarded as one of the earliest and most influential examples of social contract theory.**[4]  


I haven't read the book myself, and only found it by accident on the disambiguation page while searching for a connection to the Farscape spaceship called Leviathan ;).
**tldr:** Probably because of this old bookbook\[1]:

Choice is good. Standards are good too. The best situation is a mix of the two, imho. You're free to disagree, but I'd prefer that you agree with my way of seeing things ;).
Also, yes, I do see the value of my profits affected by competing altcoins should they manage to outcompete my main investement that (currently) is bitcoin. With that said, if I'd see an altcoin that I believe will outcompete bitcoin, I'd exchange my bitcoin for that altcoin instead. Once you have your value stored in a digital coin, it's quick and easy to move between them. I also hodl a tiny amount of namecoin for example.

Hmm... So when Uber starts to accept bitcoin (Uber's payment processing provider was Braintree who recently started offering the handling of bitcoin, yes?), I'd be able to call an Uber driver over to my restaurant, and ask the driver to pay my meal with their credit card / fiat cash on my behalf? 
That would make for an unusual first date: 
- Guy: "Check please?" [Pressing a few buttons on mobile phone.]
- Waiter leaves the check on the restaurant table.
- Uber taxi driver walks in, drops a few cash bills on the table and leaves.
- Girl: "Who was that?"
- "Oh, it's just a guy from a payment service that I'm using to pay for things. You see, it's like a kind of Amex card but with personal service."
- "Ooo, keey..."
- Guy: "So, my place or your place?"
- The same Uber driver walks in again 30 seconds later, wearing a different (Uber) t-shirt with the taxi car logo on it this time (which is his other job).
Tldr: Just trying to figure out how the future may look like.

Actually, showing the latest transactions in realtime would be a very cool thing to be showing in those circumstances. Much better than showing physical bitcoins that only confuse the people who don't really know what a bitcoin is.

@_date: 2014-11-15 10:10:42
Yes that good. However we may be talking about two different things. You seem to be talking about buys and sells using your Safello exchange service. 
But I meant to also add it into your future wallet phone app, for *all* transactions. Let's say I load my phone app with 10 bitcoins that I had from long ago. I'd like to be able to (when I add the bitcoins to the wallet) specify that I bought them for 50 USD / bitcoin, and then after I've had maybe let's say 20 restaurant visits spending those coins, I would be able to press a button to get a pdf report on the taxes I should pay for all of those restaurant visits. 
I got my bitcoins primarily from Mtgox when they were still active, so it would not be enough with a report for all my purchases of bitcoin that I've made from Safello.
And since you're based in Sweden, I figured you'd be among the best suited to create such a tax calculating and reporting feature in your phone wallet, and keep it updated with contemporary tax law as it (probably) changes. I'd think it would take a long time before for example blockchain.info would add such a feature to their international phone wallet app.

Adding to that, I'm planning on selling a small fraction of my bitcoin holding if/when the price reaches 2000 usd/xbt, then sell off a slightly larger fraction if/when at 8000 usd/xbt, and holding the rest as bitcoin (never converting to usd) for continuous use if/when bitcoin has reached mainstream adoption.
The reason I mentioned that is to illustrate how hoarding and deflation is not bad. I'm just betting that bitcoin will reach mainstream adoption and don't want to sell them too cheaply. I also don't want to hold every bitcoin until mass adoption has been reached, because I value having some better quality of life right now, and not save all of my increased quality of life for several years into the future.
It's like eating candy: Yes, it makes me fat, costs money, degrades the quality of my teeth. Even though I really really much want to have a fit body and excellent teeth (long term happiness, hodling), I still value short term happiness a few times a month (by eating a cookie, selling for usd at lower price).

Personally I prefer doing business with actual real humans, and not the kind of company drones you seem to hold in high regard. This particular human seems to be bitcoin hostile. So what? Let him. At least he gave you his honest opinion and did so clearly marking it as his personal opinion and not as an official company opinion.
I too share your opinion "that the level of personalization a company's representatives are allowed to use speaks a lot about the company itself". The difference between us though, is that I see it as a positive whereas you see it as a negative.
And yes, the support person's reply was unprofessionally and somewhat insultingly written, making the potential customer sound like an idiot for not using a shoebox instead of using bitcoin. So what though? He's a human obviously, which means you can argue the benefits of accepting bitcoin with him. You can never change a drone's mind, but humans' you can given the appropriate arguments. One you could try for example would be to ask why he thinks bitcoin is so useless as a technology and payment system when such big organizations as Expedia, Dish and even the US government deal in bitcoin (US Marshals selling the confiscated bitcoins in an open auction). 
From [their Wikipedia page]( "It now has a staff of over 1,500 employees.". So the Redditor could ask "Why do you think a company ten times your size (Expedia, 14500 employees vs. B&amp;H Photo, 1500 emplyees) is wrong about accepting bitcoin as a payment method?".
Take advantage of having the opportunity to communicate with an actual human. It's beneficial to both the customer and the company. Opinions are opinions, and with new information and proper arguments they can be changed to more successfully align with reality. And change for mutual profit :).

I would in OP:s case rather buy 10 % bitcoin. 25 % gold, 50 % total in USD+EUR+(maybe CNY) and keep the rest in TRY for convenience, paying bills etc. And I would in OP:s case not trust the judgement of random redditors but try to use their suggestions as a starting point to research and forming my own opinion. Because decisions regarding life savings / a lot of money should be spent a lot of time upon.
Regarding gold, only buy physical bullion gold. Not certificates or numismatic gold. Don't tell anyone you bought and own it because your government may try to take it from you if their economy experiences huge problems. Fast inflation is indicative of big problems.
Stay away from altcoins and silver. The less volatile alternatives are volatile enough as they are, in my opinion.
If OP is a computer geek that is very skilled in computer security, then OP could increase their bitcoin holdings from 10 to maybe 20 % instead.
tl;dr: I'm a geek not an economist, so don't follow my advice.

Yes, I run a 2 kW radiator heater in my apartment today during winter. I'd replace it with a mining enabled radiator if it would cost just a little more. I'd see it as a way to get a little back on my electricity cost that I'm spending anyway. There is always winter somewhere in the world, so with users like me, there would never be a lack of miners and mining would remain decentralized. It all depends on future radiators with a very cheap and high hash rate mining component. But just as SD memory cards have become very cheap and are very efficient at storing large amounts of data, I think eventually the same should hopefully happen to mining chips. So the centralization of mining should, as you write, be only temporary. 
Today's mining farms would no longer make any sense, unless they do it primarily for the purpose of increasing the temperature of the room / building. 
Ideally the radiator would have a bitcoin chip slot just like computers have an SD card slot. That way the bitcoin chip could be upgraded over time just as people upgrade their SD cards, as technology evolves.

I'd like to recommend them to buy a little bitcoin as an investment for the future but didn't feel comfortable suggesting it because there would be such a big risk that they install some trojan or something that would steal their bitcoins.
Would this be a very easy way for these friends of mine to buy bitcoin instead of like for example Google or Apple stock? Would they do it exactly the same way but pick "bitcoin" instead of "apple"? Because then I would suggest this investment any time a friend talks about stocks or funds as an investment.

**It sounds like you have a gambling problem.** And even if I'm wrong, I would still think a psychologist who knows how to help people with gambling problems, would also be able to help you with whatever is causing you to overpurchasing.
**Bitcoin's rise in value is far from inevitable.** There are many things that could happen that would destroy bitcoin and its current value.
1. You could accidentally lose all your bitcoins to a hacker that steals them from you.
2. You could forget your password and lose access forever to all your bitcoins.
3. Someone may invent a superior and vastly more useful altcoin that would make bitcoin irrelevant, which would cause bitcoin's value to plummet down to effectively zero. Maybe you'd be the last person to sell your bitcoin in order to buy this superior altcoin for whatever reason.
4. There could be a technological bug that we've not yet discovered that would make bitcoin suddenly unfeasible after being discovered.
5. An economic reason could become discovered for bitcoin to be unfeasable and replaced by a competing and better system / solution. Maybe you won't see this coming.
6. You may loose your job and / or house and / or health which would force you to liquidate your coins while they are still worth a little.
Probably many more reasons that makes bitcoin a very risky investment.
**So, with that in mind, none of us should invest more in bitcoin than we would be comfortable losing.** If bitcoin takes off and reaches mainstream adoption, **we will have made a ton of money anyway**, despite having only invested a small amount of fiat into bitcoin. We are still very very early investors. **Don't be greedy and don't be stupid.** **See a psychologist about your gambling problem** and see that visit as an investment to secure your bitcoin holdings. 
If you can buy a dedicated computer for your bitcoin business, you can also buy a psychologist for your brain. What good is a dedicated cold storage offline extra computer, if your malfunctioning brain causes you to lose your bitcoins? Honeybadger don't care.

Then a few years later someone started using "intranet" for the local kind of internet and the global internet would be called "internet" with a lowercase "i".
After a few years everyone started to use "in**tra**net" and "internet" instead of "internet" and "Internet".
So maybe we could try to start using a new word instead of simply making the first letter in "bitcoin" signify an important meaning? Perhaps we would use "bitcoin" for the currency and "bitnet" for the payment network?
With distinct words separating the currency from the payment network, there would be no confusion especially when a sentence starts with the word "Bitcoin" but where the author is referring to the currency (and had to capitalize the word anyway because grammar).
tldr: "internet"+"Internet" became "intranet"+"internet" many years ago. Would it be a good idea to change "bitcoin"+"Bitcoin" to "bitcoin"+"bitnet"?

You can install the Android wallet app from blockchain.info[1] on your Android phone (probably available for the Iphone as well nowadays). Then, you can add a "watch only" address in the app. The next time someone sends you XBT to your address, your phone will alert you.
Be absolutely sure that you visit the legitimate blockchain.info, and install their legitimate app. There are many coin stealing sites and apps out there, hoping you'll accidentally spell the site wrong and visit their site instead of the intended for example. Check your spelling! :P.
Also make sure that you don't unintentionally send XBT to your watch only address. Maybe you'll have to "archive" your "watch only" address so that the "change" from a transaction you make in the future doesn't unintentionally go to your "watch only" address.
Personally, I just specify the change address each and every time I send a transaction from my phone, so I can be absolutely sure that the "change" doesn't unintentionally go to a "watch address" of which I don't have the private key to (or someone else also has a copy of that private key). Also, educate yourself about how some people have lost bitcoins when "swiping keys", if you'd ever use such a feature, before using the "swipe key" feature. And use "cold storage" for most of your coins.
Ok, I see now that I don't know the default behavior of the blockchain app which makes me unsuitable to give you a definite and very secure answer, so I'll just answer like this instead and hope that someone else clarifies: "You can experiment with a blockchain.info phone app, and learn about proper bitcoin security to make sure that your experiment doesn't risk you losing coins". I hope someone else can give you a more userfriendly answer than I could :).

Well, as far as I can remember, someone told me in the year 2000 that "The total number of users with internet access have passed 200 million.". At that time I believe there were about 6 billion people on the planet, so that would be only 3.3 % of the population having internet access. So I'd still consider that as "only a limited number" was using the internet, compared to the number we're taking for granted today.

It was also possible to upload your messages and download discussions that you were subscribing to, go offline, and while offline do all the reading and writing without getting charged by the minute. So, yes, it was very expensive to be online back then compared to now, but if you spent some time thinking how to avoid paying so much, there were ways to do that in some circumstances. Still not something the average citizen was doing back then. Mainstream adoption started a few years later.

*An ordinary person that owns a car drives another ordinary person, much more "peer to peer" than a professional taxi driver would, for example. These kinds of companies seem like they were made to be matched with a currency like bitcoin. So such companies will probably adopt first, is my guess.

The fastest increase of the bubble also happened to coincide within 30 minutes of the first New York Senate hearings that they held with several other government agencies. 
Personally, I believe that the sudden and large price rise was mostly due to the world for the first time could hear (it was live-streaming) how positively the Senate group were thinking about Bitcoin.
I remember sighing of relief when I realized that they were smart enough not to see Bitcoin as only a threat, but officially talked and even focused on the positive use cases of the Bitcoin system and currency. When the speaker compared Bitcoin today to how he experienced the early days of the Internet, I remember feeling for the first time an important feeling of semi-outspoken government acceptance. I think many thought the same, which lead to a sudden and large bubble in the price.

Yes, that would be a problem. But if the customer asks if they can pay with bitcoin and the answer is yes, and the whole process goes very quickly phone app to phone app, then perhaps the boss would just think that their employee gave better service than expected of them. And if the purpose is not to earn money on exchange rates or fees, then I don't think I'd mind if I were the boss and one of my employees did such a deal.

I'm not a user of coinbase because I don't live in the USA, but if Blockchain.info would implement the same feature in cooperation with my Bitstamp account for example, then I would think it would add a great feature to my Blockchain.info Android wallet app. Why?
I would be able to sell (a larger amount of) bitcoin 3-4 times a year, and only remember those 3-4 transactions for my taxes. The rest of my purchases made by my Android Blockchain.info wallet would not have to be reported because I would not have made any capital gains tax.
So, yes there would be a significant total fee for each of my smaller purchases. But I'd see that as a convenience fee to make my tax reporting very easy, and I'd gladly pay it if it would be as you've calculated "only" 4-5 %.
Perhaps in the future there will be a localized Blockchain.info app that would be able to calculate my Swedish taxes for me, making this instant-buy-back unnecessary. But until that happens, I'll gladly pay this 5 % convenience fee. That way I can hold more of my net worth in bitcoin and I'd wager that bitcoin will appreciate more than 5 % in one year, making it a net win for me personally.

But bitcoin core does random writes, and those are much slower on a mechanical hard drive than on an SSD. At least on my computer there were a dramatic difference in speed after I moved the blockchain files to an SSD. I'm on a 100 Mbps connection and didn't monitor the bandwidth usage at the time though, so I don't know how significantly lower bandwidths would affect blockchain downloads.

If you ever wanted to buy "legitimate" bitcoins, then here is your chance to buy them directly from the government. If someone with a  lot of money but with the opinion that owning bitcoins is a legally speaking an uncertain area at this point in time, notices this auction, they can participate without feeling this uncertainty.
Personally I think that any bitcoin is as good as any other bitcoin, but acknowledge the fact that there may be people with a lot of money who don't share that viewpoint. For them, these bitcoins probably sound attractive.

"In the second half, Max interviews Perianne Boring of the Chamber of Digital Commerce about the chamber’s role in advocating for bitcoin and where she sees the future of regulation heading."

I'd never heard of this "Chamber of Digital Commerce" before, but was positively surprised of what she (Perianne) had to say about her organization and its purpose and goals. She seems to be a person that knows what she's doing.

Imagine a person let's call him Adam. He has bitcoin just like you. He bought one bitcoin for the price 100 USD / bitcoin, and they are now worth 1000 USD / bitcoin. He sees a thing on TigerDirect that he wants. He uses some of his "free money" (let's say 200 of the 900 USD worth of bitcoin profit) and saves the rest. Why do this? Well, what's the point of saving bitcoin and never use it. Then it's like they don't even exist. He may use his fiat that he doesn't have so much of for things that cannot yet be bought with bitcoin.
Adam would only buy things he really wanted because he also wants to save his bitcoin for the future because they are currently on average constantly increasing in value. But he really wants this particular TD computer, and he spends some of his bitcoin for it.
Yesterday I bought dinner at a restaurant from my "spending account" of bitcoin that I have in my phone. I didn't get any particular benefits, other than the feeling of getting a free meal because I still had more value left in my phone after the meal than I originally had put into the phone. I don't have much fiat and use the fiat for things that bitcoin currently cannot buy. My name is not Adam...

I can confirm that I lost a lot of money by storing bitcoin on Mtgox, and I still don't want regulation despite that fact. Regulating bitcoin transactions would be like having each email regulated (filtered) by your local priest or bishop before being allowed to be sent to the final recipient. It would've made email practically unusable. 
I'm glad that the regulators chose to leave email alone when email was a new technology. They should leave bitcoin transactions alone as well. Yes, I get spam and phishing attempts, but the free market created a quite good spam filtering system (gmail works very good for me) without any political or clerical regulation.
Imagine a world where every email had to be approved by a central authority before being allowed to be sent to the intended recipient. Yes, it would inconvenience terrorism communication, drug deals, money laundering and other kinds of illegal communication, and help catch some of those people. But imagine how slow the world would work as a consequence of having such regulation and filtering. 
With bitcoin, money transactions have become just like email - it's just the communication of information, and it should be left just as unregulated as email is unregulated.
The criminals can be catched and stopped in other ways than by regulating (and consequently stifling) technology such as bitcoin and email. Please don't censor bitcoin and don't censor email.

Please don't do this. I think most receivers of currency in the form of coins and bills would consider messages on them as a form of spam.

Personally I would get angry or at the very least irritated if people would start marketing their products by putting messages on the local physical currency that I'd be using. Please don't do this, there has to be other ways to market bitcoin.

If you don't spam gas station workers, they might discover bitcoin  by themselves over time. If you spam them, that will only make them resist doing that much longer. It's better to never spam. If you want to promote Bitcoin the proper way, just ask simply "Can I pay with bitcoin?" every time you make a purchase and you're there for the first time. If the answer is no, accept it and don't ask the same place again until a month has passed. A month seems reasonable since that seems to be a long time in bitcoin world and anything can happen.

Aren't they also in posession of DPR's personal bitcoins that they've presumably confiscated? If yes, then there may be another chance to buy bitcoins from the US gov quite soon. Also, they're likely to keep confiscating bitcoins from future people who get caught doing illegal things. So I'd rephrase "once-in-a-lifetime" to "rare". 
Also, this first auction occurrence will be indicative about what above-spot-price a future auction would likely yield. As bitcoin grows older and everyone sees it as more and more "obviously" legitimate, the difference between an auction price and an ordinary exchange price should become less and less.

It's also bad to have too much fragmentation. Imagine if everyone were creating their own incompatible altcoin. Then each altcoin would have very few miners for example, and every altcoin would have easily bruteforced blockchains due to few miners. It's better to unite around a "good enough" altcoin (bitcoin in this case) to have a strong and therefore secure blockchain, and many eyes on the code to spot bugs etc. Companies like Expedia and Dell wouldn't have adopted any digital currency if there would not have been for all the pooled effort from developers and other people uniting around the same currency.
We are not anticompetitive. We just see the value of not fragmenting the development and usage of digital coin too much. Altcoins are welcome and good for testing out new ideas. But having one main "good enough" coin is also very useful.

As far as I understood it, there are a lot of teachers in the school who are supporting the idea and are going to research and write papers about this experiment.

I'd say the odds would be pretty high, because when people see that it's not safe to keep their bitcoins on Mtgox, and they assume it's not safe on any exchange, there will be sudden mass withdrawals everywhere. Many people moving bitcoin away from exchanges into private wallets at the same time would exhaust exchanges' hot wallets.
I don't know how fast exchanges are able to refill their hot wallets, but it would be too soon to panic until that time has passed, I'd guess.

Personally, I thought that the politicians at the latest New York hearing were actually surprisingly positive to the bitcoin system. They seemed curious and seemed to want to figure out how to get all the benefits that todays and future bitcoin could give them while at the same time do whatever they can to make it as hard as possible to use todays and future bitcoin in way contrary to their interests such as money laundering and financing terrorism. Personally I expected that they would not even talk about nor see the benefits that the bitcoin system can and could offer them. So even though I was pessimistic, I thought the hearing(s) went surprisingly well.
So now we (ok, I'm not American, but whatever you guys do affects the rest of us on this small globe) seem to have two groups of politicians (the Senate hearings and the New York hearings) and one single politician (Bryan Parker) who seem to want bitcoin or at least parts of it to succeed.

But doesn't gold ETFs increase the money supply of gold, therefore causing an increase in supply which causes a decline in price? 
If there would be no gold ETFs, then the amount of gold traded would be the same as the amount of physical gold available, and the amount of physical gold available is almost the same year after year since it's so laborious to dig up new gold.
The same reasoning should apply to bitcoin. There is a limited supply, but when an ETF is created, then that supply increases by many hundred %. No more 21 million limit, which should lead to a decline in price.

The article claims that Skype is also p2p when it comes to the software. So if Skype the company would shut down, the Skype client software would still function for free Skype to Skype calls.
I think the article was well worth the read. It's encouraging to think back how hopeless it felt that Skype would be allowed to exist considering it would take away so much revenue from the telecom companies of the time. This was before broadband and people were still using their telephone lines to connect to the internet.

I've been thinking about how to contribute to decentralize mining. I wanted to buy one of those small USB miners and run it on my computer just to help with the decentralization, and not to make a large profit. I would actually even accept a smaller loss in doing this, just to contribute to decentralization.
But people have told me that my approach would be very ineffective because my contribution would be so small that it would essentially be insignificant. So I never bought any USB miner.
But buying a share in a company that does everything for me seems easy and effective. They would do all the hardware upgrades, and I would probably loose only a little (not really caring for profit from mining), but would make an effective "contribution / USD" in decentralizing the mining that the bitcoin network is so dependent upon.
So, why would I accept a small net loss in doing this mining? Well, simply because if enough people would do the same, then mining decentralization would not be a problem and I would be able to sleep better at night not worrying about the future value of my cold wallet bitcoins.
So what would happen if more than 50 % of people who mine would use Petamine to do their mining for them? Wouldn't that introduce another single point of failure no matter whether or not Petamine uses this p2pool kind of mining that I don't actually understand? Couldn't a government seize all of Petamine's operations since Petamine would have all their hardware in the same place? What's the big deal that they "join p2pool" or however that should be written?
So what's the best way for me to just throw some small amount of money at the problem (Let's say 200 USD worth of bitcoin)? Should I throw it at Petamine because they are a relatively small player, and then throw another 200 USD worth of bitcoin at a different mining company a year from now when Petamine has grown too large?
What's the benefit of waiting to throw some money on them until they've done their "p2pool thing", as opposed to throwing the money right now?
I'll do my 200 USD contribution to contribute to save the value of my other bitcoins. But I don't have the time to buy dedicated hardware, set it up etc. I can do this contribution once a year.

Most people would in most circumstances not buy bitcoin and spend them the same day. They probably won't do that for several years until the bitcoin value volatility has stabilized. So today people would probably buy and hold for a little time before using it.
In the future merchants will offer benefits to customers who choose to buy with bitcoin because they won't care if Visa/Mastercard among others will ban them for offering discounts to their competition. They won't care because most people will already be using bitcoin anyway by that time.
So when the time has come that most people are already using bitcoin and for that reason bitcoin has stopped increasing in value, then the few people who are not already using bitcoin will start doing so for the benefits that the merchants will offer. Or simply because of the all the benefits of bitcoin itself such as all prices worldwide being denominated in bitcoin and not in the local mostly irrelevant currencies. It's very convenient to have one standardized world currency with the added benefit of being truly owned by you and not a third party, and the benefit of never inflating just because some government or bank decides to print money.
I just hope the Americans won't resist bitcoin as fiercely as they keep resisting the world standard called "the metric system" ;).

Could be. But on the other hand the CEO was explicitly asked whether or not he owned any bitcoins personally. The answer the CEO gave was without hesitating a "yes" with that excited smile on his face that I've seen quite a few times when talking to bitcoiners who have made the long term bet that comes from a belief in bitcoin's fundamentals. 
If the CEO would have been thinking about Ripple or any other cryptocurrency than bitcoin, I'd wager that he would have at least mentioned Ripple or whatever other cryptocurrency he would've been thinking of. So my bet is that the CEO is considering bitcoin primarily, over other cryptocurrencies.
I didn't think I would hear such a positive opinion about bitcoin from the CEO of Ebay this soon in Bitcoin's development. I wasn't sure I'd ever hear it, but [definitely]( not this soon.

Yes, if you ask a programmer / system developer during an after work, most will probably argue at least somewhat that software patents are more good than bad.  
But if you'd have asked them when they know they could speak anonymously, then probably most would've argued that allowing software patents is a very bad idea not at all worth pursuing as a society.  
The reason so many redditors react so strongly against bitcoin companies trying to get patents is probably because 1. many redditors are programmers, and 2. many of those redditors are using nicknames that aren't (without much work) linkable to their IRL identities.

People who believe that bitcoin will gain mass adoption are going to want to buy bitcoin to get a part of the value increase. They won't be buying bitcoin for the purpose of making purchases on TigerDirect. But once they have bought bitcoin and they have increased in value, they are probably going to want to spend some of their bitcoin profit. So, yes, new guys aren't going to buy bitcoin just before they make a TD purchase. 
But there will be a lot of new guys wanting to make a profit on the currency itself, and once they've made a noticable profit, they'll have become old guys. And old guys are going to want to make a TD purchase with their old bitcoin. Going from new to old guy usually takes just about half a year in todays market so I think we won't see a shortage of new guys in the near future.
5 years from now when the value increase has slowed down, then merchants will probably offer benefits for customers who choose bitcoin as their payment method. Today most don't.

Cool, doing that would give us to rates: Gox-bitcoin / Real-bitcoin, and Bitstamp-bitcoin / Real-bitcoin. Whichever of those two numbers would be closer to 1, would indicate that the public trust in that exchange would be higher. A sort of exchange "trustiness-index".
If everything is good with Mtgox, it would cost 1 real bitcoin for 1 gox-bitcoin. Then the value for Mtgox would be 1 (because 1/1=1). If there is mistrust, then it would cost 0.5 real bitcoins for 1 gox-bitcoin. Then the value would be 0.5 (because 0.5/1=0.5). If there would be very much mistrust the price would be 0.1 real bitcoins for 1 gox-bitcoin, and the value would be 0.1, a lot further away from 1 than 0.5. One could say that in the last case, the trust would be 10 %, and in the first case the trust would be 100 % (assuming you could trust the gox-bitcoin to real bitcoin-exchange service itself).

Your idea of a changetip specific phone keyboard would certainly make handling tips very convenient and fast. But at the same time you would really have to trust the keyboard app provider with every keyboard button press ever made on that phone. You'd have to give the keyboard app complete access to listen to every key press, and personally I wouldn't sacrifice that much security for the gained convenience. 
It would be very tempting for the special purpose keyboard app developer to listen to all of your entered passwords. It would be almost certain that a phone user using that app, would also use other bitcoin related apps and services, making this an excellent attack vector to sniff account credentials.

You may be correct in that only the actively selected keyboard is listening to key presses. That policy could theoretically change suddenly in the future though. Android has already "simplified" their app permission system once. But I'm unusually risk averse when it comes to IT, so maybe other people would like to use such a keyboard app in the current app permission system, and be vigilant for any future potential changes to it. 
And also at all times be very alert as to which keyboard they'd be using for which app. I just don't trust myself to be that alert, and would therefore sacrifice convenience for security in a case such as this.

They probably chose that particular multiplier with the intent to get as close as possible to 10 SEK per certificate. Currently one bitcoin costs approximately 2 000 SEK, and if multiplying with 0.005 you get a more practical and manageable price per certificate (0.005 * 2 000 = 10). But I agree, why not choose 0.001 instead, that would've been an even better choice for the even longer term future.
The price of bitcoin fluctuates extremely anyway so why not choose "a thousands of a bitcoin per certificate" for simplicity. Maybe they tried to avoid the psychological effect of thinking: "Only 2 SEK per certificate? That seems like a cheap and worthless investment.", even though it would only have been reasoning based on emotion and not on actual logic. The chosen multiplier is strictly speaking just an arbitrary number, but it probably affects peoples impression of value nonetheless.

The reason to choose a relatively low initial price offering such as 10 SEK per certificate, I would assume is that the issuer expects the price to rise quickly and much, and want to postpone needing to have to split the shares into more convenient sizes so soon into the future. 
If the share price would very soon go from 200 SEK to 2000 SEK, then a lot of smaller investors / speculators wouldn't be able to afford even one share, thus slowing trade and adoption unnecessarily, at least until a split. I don't know how fast a split is usually made (I'm a tech guy, not a trader so my knowledge is very limited), but I'd guess it would take at least one business day, and during that business day there would be many people who would choose not to buy at all because maybe they're thinking that they only want to buy shares for 1000 SEK because they feel speculating in bitcoin is just too risky.
There are a lot of people who are interested in speculating / investing just a small amount because they heard of bitcoin but don't yet know almost anything about it. My first bitcoin investment was for only 500 SEK for example, before I had time to learn more about the invention. At that time I simply wouldn't have bought any shares at all, if the minimum investment would've been 2000 SEK.

One of the purposes of a FOSS-license is explicitly to permit carbon copies.
That said, even if it would not have been explicitly permitted, there is still innovation in a source code fork but in this case on a hardware level.

From a *programmer's or a developer's perspective*, the change is trivial and there is almost no risk to make an error (because it's just one line of code). But at the same the *economic consequences* are less trivial and arguably even somewhat complex. But it's far from as complex as building a space rocket that does not blow up at lift off.

Great. Now do another thing that Uber has done. Remove the limit of a maximum of 1 million concurrent drivers globally. Oh wait, Uber never even had such a silly limit. Must have been one of Uber's competitors. 
You know, one of those many competitors that did the same thing as Uber, but never got popular enough because they limited how many drivers could drive at the same time.
Let Bitcoin become the Uber of money: Remove the 1 MB blocksize limit, so that more people can use Bitcoin at the same time. Adopt more users or die from competition. Stagnate in growth and remain unknown and irrelevant. 
There can only be one default money. Bitcoin is *currently* the default. Don't unnecessarily stop it's growth, or Bitcoin will eventually loose its advantage of being the default choice. 
Fees can't rise indefinitely because there are other taxi companies that will gladly accept the unsatisfied customers for a cheaper fare. 
**Most of the hours of the year, Uber's price has a surge factor of 1.0. That's why they are the market leader in their category.** Bitcoin must also remain having a transaction fee surge factor of 1.0 most of its hours, or it simply cannot become a market leader like Uber has become.

"Never"? Quite often what is *right* is the exact same thing as what is *popular*. The reason that Bitcoin as a whole is getting more and more popular is because Bitcoin is "more right" than the current fiat systems that the world is using.

Then I thought I should chip in just in case, so they don't sell their company to someone who'd ruin the site like Digg or something just to make some money. 
They may do it anyway, but I'm gambling they won't if they make enough money so they don't have anything to worry about.

I think your system of measuring opinions of the people and their votes has a very good chance of working and becoming very useful for all kinds of projects and questions. Your system feels very much like Wikipedia felt in the beginning.
The most common question was "Why should we trust what is written there when anyone is allowed to change anything in under a minute? All it takes is a few bad apples and all of the content will have become nonsense. We need encyclopedias written by Experts."
But Wikipedia grew both in terms of users, authors, editors and articles. The quality has been consistently very good despite that the number of internet trolls who just wanted to sabotage the content, also grew. As long as the vast majority of Wikipedia users don't try to cheat the system, the cheaters can be and are successfully filtered out. I guess that the same will happen with the "consider.it"-system over the years.
Some Wikipedia articles are much more subjected to users who try to sabotage them or make edits in their own personal favor. Controversial and very popular articles such as "Atheism", "Christianity", "Democrats", "Republicans" or "Barack Obama" are often not allowed to be edited by Wikipedia accounts that are less than 1 month old, in order to reduce the amount of sabotage, bias, and spam attempts. It's also possible to "subscribe" to a specific Wikipedia article to get instant notifications when someone has made an update, and very easy to revert a malicious update. 
Without going into details, the tools to prevent malicious Wikipedia edits have evolved over the years. I expect similar tools and functionality to be developed for the "consider.it"-project as well. I'm excited about the current as well as future great usefulness of the "consider.it" software and idea. Just as the software that runs Wikipedia can and is used by many other projects (see e.g. wikia.com for many examples) I expect the "consider.it" software and idea to be used by many other future projects.
**Tldr:** **The "consider.it" software is very similar to the software that runs Wikipedia, in terms of the ability to prevent spam, biased user edits, and sabotage attempts.** Wikipedia developed tools over the years as the number of users grew, and I expect the same to happen to the "consider.it" voting and opinion measuring system. People learned to trust Wikipedia articles (with a little critical thinking) and people will similarly learn to trust the Considerit proposals and questions. Bright future for this innovation, I expect!

A bug (  
The app claims that the current block number is one lower than it actually is, if I do these steps over and over again (maybe five times) quickly:  
1. Start the app from the desktop icon.  
2. Click confirm.  
3. Goto 1.
A suggestion (  
Add a "View pending reminders" button so that it's possible to see a list of all reminders that are still waiting to be executed. It should be possible to click a future reminder to edit it. It should be possible to see that for example one of the reminders now have 3 confirmations left of the original 6. Like a countdown. Make it possible to configure the length of the vibration. Currently it's too long for my taste.

It would only take me 10 minutes to mine each block if I was the only miner, not 12 years. It would only take 12 years to solo mine a block if there were a lot of miners competing.

One shouldn't be angry at a user for preferring a 20 USD bitcoin hardware wallet over a 100 USD bitcoin hardware wallet, if the user only has a total of 1000 USD in bitcoin to protect. Maybe many users simply don't have more bitcoin than that? In that case, it actually makes sense to buy a cheaper and less secure hardware wallet. Sure, if you plan on storing bitcoin for 1 million USD, then it would be unreasonably risky to try to save 80 USD on a cheaper and less secure hw wallet. 
Also, people with a very large amount of bitcoin maybe simply comment on these kinds of threads significantly less, so it makes it seem as if most users are just careless about their cold storage security solution.

What do you think is bad about deflation in regard to bitcoin? 
Personally, I think of the computer industry as a whole to be a great example of why deflation is something good and desirable. If you have 1000 usd to buy computers for, but wait 12 months, you'll be able to buy a computer twice as fast, half the size and so on. 
The same with mobile phones. Wait, and get the top model for half the price. Yet both the computer and mobile industries are and have been booming for decades. So deflation is good when it comes to those two industries then, right? 
I'd argue that bitcoin is like those two industries in regard to deflation. That is, deflation is good for bitcoin, not bad.

Two forks (in this case: two altclients)  compete for the same user base. The altclient that wins the most users has won the fork. Not everyone can be a winner. If users are not using your altclient after a fork event, then your altclient and its 1 MB rule will have lost. It actually *is* a popularity contest. All money is. 
The currently most popular currency is the USD. Bitcoin will possibly win the popularity contest with the USD, eventually. The 2 MB rule (and the altclient Bitcoin Classic) will possibly win the popularity contest with the 1 MB rule (and the altclient Bitcoin Core), eventually. 
The American President Barack Obama won the popularity contest between the presidential candidates. There's nothing inherently wrong with participating in and winning a popularity contest. In the case with human presidents, there is an election occurring once every 4 years. In the case with Bitcoin rules, there is an election occurring approximately once every 10 minutes on average.

Bitcoin is going to disrupt traditional currencies just like Khan Academy is going to disrupt traditional high profile universities like Harvard and Yale. You may think that you're arguing that Bitcoin transaction fees are too low and non-exclusive, but you're actually making the opposite point: Harvard and Yale fees are unreasonably too high and free (or at cost) universities like Khan Academy are going to be the better and preferred alternative.
Then you will likely say that "But a diploma from Harvard and Yale means much more than a good score at the free Khan Academy.". But I remember a time when teachers didn't allow students to quote Wikipedia "because it wasn't an accredited information source". Fast forward a few years, and university teachers are gladly accepting Wikipedia as a legitimate source.
Wikipedia totally disrupted the encyclopedia business, Khan Academy will disrupt the "university diploma" business, and Bitcoin will disrupt the traditional currencies and peer to peer payment systems of the world. But Bitcoin will only disrupt anything if we manage to keep the transaction fees low. Wikipedia for example would not have experienced the success it has if a Wikipedia subscription would've cost more than a subscription to a traditional "high profile" encyclopedia.

That reasoning is like refusing to use email instead of paper letters for the fear of accidentally hitting the reply all button instead of the reply button. The email software can have a warning message with a 5 second timeout or a captcha or whatever to stop clumsy people to use the reply all button unintentionally. 
The bitcoin software could easily incorporate some "are you really sure you want to send *all* your money to this known and previously trusted address?" or "are you sure you want to send more than 10 usd worth of bitcoin to this address that is not yet in your address book?" function.

If what you're saying is true, then I'd wish you good luck on your server business, while at the same time being very angry at you for loosing so many of my bitcoins that I had on mtgox. Personally I would think 30 % of all your future personal profits going to the fund would be reasonable. Also, if you would happen to manage to earn more than 10 million usd in personal wealth, then everything above that should be donated to that fund until your debt was completely paid off. 
If you would choose to live like that, then you would have regained my respect to you. But I would still be angry until everyone would have been repaid in full. And even after that I would not do any significant business with you for a very long time, probably never. 
The way I see it currently, you're very likely just a liar and a thief. I think a reasonable outcome of your actions should be jail and a debt with a difficult repayment plan, if the courts would find you guilty. I do not wish you any bodily harm, rape etc even if you would be found guilty like others have suggested. Also calling you fat is just mean and unnecessary. Technologically incompetent though, is probably well deserved, from what I've read about you. Above average sure, but not nearly enough to run a site like mtgox.

That sounds like an approach that is very centralized in nature. One of the main points of using Bitcoin at all is due to most aspects of it being decentralized. Decentralization of which software teams are available to miners and other users, would benefit the Bitcoin project as a whole. 
You can't have only one "unified" development team if you want to promote the product as offering "permissionless innovation for everyone who wants to participate in the network". An ecosystem that is not diverse will stagnate, stop evolving and eventually be replaced by another ecosystem that is not "unified" as you call it.


There is little to gain by promoting a product to new users, when the product doesn't have the capacity to handle more users. Increase the block size limit first, and *then* promote the product to new users. The blocks are already (practically*) full with the users we already have.
*See Jeff Garzik's explanation of "The Fidelity Problem" for a more complete definition of "full" blocks.

The problem is that our prominent teachers like Luke Jr are teaching Creationism instead of the Evolution Theory. Sometimes even teachers are just wrong. Bitcoin needs to evolve from its current 1 MB shackles.
The students tried to change the curriculum but after getting repeatedly refused, are now changing schools instead. But not everyone will leave the Catholic School of Bitcoin Core. I'm sure the Amish will stay and appreciate the teachings.
It would be interesting to compare the number of creationists in the Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Classic projects. Clearly one of those projects wants Bitcoin to keep evolving. There's room for both types of people on this planet. But just because 1 million Amish have consciously chosen to stay behind doesn't mean that the rest of us 7 billion also have to. We just choose different schools and can coexist peacefully.

Don't worry. Plan C is already coded, tested and ready. All we need is more miners to actually start mining BIP109 blocks.

Bitcoin altclients on the main chain (that the economic majority has chosen to be on) are called Bitcoin altclients. But you're right about that the altclient Bitcoin Core will become an altclient of an altcoin to Bitcoin after the fork has split the one Bitcoin blockchain into two blockchains (assuming that the altclient Bitcoin Classic wins the fork), where only one of the chains will remain the Bitcoin blockchain. 
There is a difference between a client and a chain and a "coin". You are calling everything a "coin", but then the difference between a client and a chain gets confused and unclear.

You ask relevant questions. What would happen in the event of a fork where both a majority side and a minority side survive and keep living? **Charlie Lee (Director of Engineering at Coinbase) recently wrote this:**


Source: 
So I interpret that as if they are going to allow you access to both the BTCs and the BTXs for as long as both sides remain alive so that you'll have plenty of time to withdraw both kinds of coins. They won't simply suddenly deny you access to any value that you have stored with them.
On a personal note, I'd expect them to even offer trading between the two types of coin that may emerge shortly after the hard fork event. I mean, they are an exchange after all and if people want to trade between BTCs and BTXs then why not offer that service. I'd sell my BTCs to get BTXs as soon as possible for example, because I bet that the BTC chain will die very quickly and the BTX chain will remain the sole survivor.
I think it probably would be possible to make such trades for a short while because people like Adam Back, Gregory Maxwell, Theymos and Luke-Jr for example would probably want to make the opposite trade because they probably believe that the BTC coins would surpass the BTX coins in value.

Cool. Any chance of also adding the Krugerrand coin as a withdrawal option? It's the world's most common gold coin and it's easier to verify that it's authentic. 
It's easier because it's sold without packaging. The gold bars are sold with original packaging that also acts as a certificate of authenticity. If you never take the bar out of its original packaging, merchants will give you a better price for them. But I prefer Krugerrands because they are supposed to be verified directly without any accompanying certificate. 
The Krugerrand coins also contain 8.3 % copper which makes them more resistant to scratches and dents in case you'd drop your coin on the floor or similar. They come in sizes from 1/10 oz to 1 oz and you get a good price for them everywhere because the coin is so extremely common. 
Some gold dealers give a better price for Pamp bars than for Heraeus while other dealers give a better price for Heraeus bars than for Pamp. It all depends on the preferences of the dealer. But everyone always gives a better price for Krugerrand coins because they're so common. So, any chance for also offering Krugerrand coins?

I agree that it is very scary that so many people store unreasonably large amounts of bitcoin on exchanges instead of storing them in their own cold storages. Hopefully the situation is less bad now when we have many more than just one exchange (Mtgox had like 75 % of all users when it crashed.). So if just one exchange crashes, maybe just 20 % of all Bitcoin users will be affected.
Also, I'm looking forward to when hardware wallets get much easier to use and get much cheaper to buy. Then more people may be more comfortable deploying their own cold storage solutions instead of relying on that service from exchanges.

Introducing a premature fee market is an ECE. The original idea was that the fee market would eventually arrive on its own, gradually, for each block subsidy halving. The normal operation of the network is (and has so far been) to never hit the max blocksize limit. It was always intended that the limit would be far beyond actual usage. The purpose of the limit was DoS protection, not a way to prematurely introduce a fee market.

As far as I've seen, Bitcoin Core has not specified what exact activation grace period that they will be using. So it could be a grace period of 1 day (very unlikely), 28 days (also unlikely), 6 months (likely), 12 months (somewhat unlikely), or maybe even 24 or 36 months (quite unlikely but it wouldn't surprise me if they tried this because its the only grace period that's "safe enough").
**Bitcoin Classic has a grace period after activation that's exactly 28 days. Bitcoin Core has not yet specified how long their grace period after activation will be.** All I've seen is that they "are guessing it will take until July 2017 until the limit increase is in effect".

The Bitcoin altclient (whose rules) that becomes dominant after a fork, is the altclient which has won the fork. It's a competition of incompatible rules, and the rules that the economic majority chooses in a fork, are the rules that have won the fork. 
The current rule that is in competition is the rule that the max blocksize limit is 1 MB. The contending rule is that the max blocksize limit is 2 MB. Both of those rules cannot be true at the same time. That's why there is a competition between those two rules, and the judge will be *the economic majority*. 
If the fork happens, then there will be one winner and one loser. The current winner in this constant competition is the 1 MB rule. But that can easily change so that the winner becomes the 2 MB rule. If and when that rule change happens, there will be a fork event.

Anyone who chooses to stand in the way of the economic majority will be routed around. There are no emotions involved here. Only money.

Yeah, you're right. It's even worse than I remembered it (My quote was from my incorrect memory.). If you look closely at the wording, they say that "activation" will likely happen around July 2017. But after "activation" comes "the grace period". If their estimation is correct, and they choose a grace period of 12 months, then the 2 MB limit will not be in effect until July **2018**.
But on the other hand, the activation may happen just a few weeks after the latest Bitcoin Core client is released. In that case the 2 MB limit will be in effect around July 2017, assuming a grace period of 12 months.
But in any case they have promised nothing of consequence because they have not specified what grace period their hard fork code will be using.

There are at least 9 of the main Bitcoin Core developers who are employed by Blockstream. I don't know how many Bitcoin Core developers there are in total, but I'm guessing like 100 people who are contributing at least every now and then. Someone who has a better number can feel free to correct me.

I too have trusted the judgement and expertise of the Bitcoin Core developers until Bitcoin XT chose to include BIP101 in its altclient. When that happened, there became a clear difference of opinion among equally competent, experienced, prominent and famous developers on what direction future Bitcoin development should go. It's simply no longer possible "to trust the developets" because now we have developers who are disagreeing with each other. We have to form our own opinions to the best of our abilities and life experiences.

Is this just your personal view or do the rest of Bitcoin Core developers also have no Plan B, if there would be a massive increase in transaction demand just like there was the last time we had a halving event (4 years ago)?

But if you only need to buy something cheap like for 5 USD worth of XBT, then you could buy whatever altcoin you'd need through shapeshift service in less than 30 seconds. A hassle yes, but a 30 second hassle and with a volatility risk of only a few minutes. But hopefully small future on chain bitcoin transactions will remain cheap like they've been so far, so that going through altcoins won't be a benefit.

Miner security will be funded by an organically growing fee market. Not by a rushed and artificially created fee market that would happen if the 1 MB blocksize limit is not raised by a large enough amount. 
The organically growing fee market will grow at the same speed as the Bitcoin network will get new users. These new users create new transactions, which generate a larger total sum of fees per block to provide increased incentive to secure the network with even more electricity spent by the miners.

Ok, while lacking expertise in all of those fields personally, you seem to have employed enough experts in all relevant scientific fields to be able to legitimately say that your company Blockstream as a whole is sufficiently competent. But while acknowledging the sum of the knowledge of all of your employees, I still don't trust that your business plan will benefit anyone outside your company share holders. 
I and several others have repeatedly asked your company President Adam Back to post a video recording of the sales pitch that you gave to your VC investors that convinced them to give you your 21 million USD seed money. Doing that would be easy for you and could possibly restore a whole lot of trust from the Bitcoin community. At the very least you could just publish the powerpoint document that was used during the sales pitch. I assume you had one and didn't delete it.
The reason I'm asking is because I believe your company is intentionally crippling two features of Bitcoin so that people will prefer to use your company products instead of using Bitcoin directly. The two features you seem to intentionally cripple is that Bitcoin is cheap (plenty of room in the blocks) and that Bitcoin is fast (0-confirmation transactions for low value transactions are trustworthy). 
Tldr: Company management people usually love to hold sales pitches and powerpoint presentations to investors. Why is Adam Back refusing to hold one for us and upload the video on youtube?

Both the Blockstream and the R3CEV companies have a conflict of interest with the rest of the participants in the Bitcoin network. Both of those companies and their employees should be treated with a high amount of skepticism.
Since Mike Hearn joined R3CEV as one of their employees, I trust him just as little as I trust for example the President of Blockstream Adam Back.
Mike Hearn did a lot of good for Bitcoin for many years and I'm grateful for his contributions, but he has now publicly and vocally joined a competitor to the Bitcoin ecosystem.
But neither Mike Hearn nor his new employer Charlie from R3CEV are correct about the death of Bitcoin as they've proclaimed it. The only things that are dying are the Bitcoin Core project and the Blockstream company that's rapidly losing political influence over the Bitcoin ecosystem.
The economic majority appears to have chosen to support the Bitcoin Classic project and to abandon support for the Bitcoin Core project and the Blockstream company. This is just a change of management. This does not mean that the Bitcoin network itself has died in any way. On the contrary - with 4 new altclients the only thing that's changed is that the development process of the Bitcoin software has increased in decentralization from just one client to 4 additional clients. This has only made Bitcoin more decentralized and therefore stronger. 
Mike Hearn declared Bitcoin dead when clearly the opposite is happening. I haven't sold a Satoshi despite the apparent market sell-off panic. The market will recover and with Bitcoin Classic's increase of the max block size limit and their removal of the Opt-in Full RBF functionality, I'm optimistic of a new ATH about 6 months after the 2016 Block Subsidy Halvening event. 
@_date: 2016-01-28 02:45:29

Not *the* miners. The *Chinese* miners. There should be more miners than just the miners who are currently heavily centralized in China due to low local electricity cost and low local bandwidth capacity. Increase the block size limit significantly and you'll also have increased miner decentralization (geographically speaking) significantly. 
Bitcoin will be better off when miners will be decentralized to more than just one country. If you keep the block size limit small, you'll just keep the miners centralized within Chinese national borders.
Mining can and should happen in other countries as well. Bitcoin was designed to be decentralized. Mining is currently happening almost only in China.

Just because I haven't read the book that you've read does not necessarily make you right and me wrong. In fact, I'd say that you're wrong and that I'm right in regard to what action and inaction constitutes and does not constitute what people refer to as "central planning". Allow me to refute your entire argument (without having read your book), with just one sentence: **"Inaction is also a form of action."**
There you go Mr. Fancy Pants. As you can now understand, there is no qualitative difference between *taking the action* of actively choosing to raise the limit, or, *taking the action* of actively choosing to not raise the limit. Both potential actions are equally actions. And therefore they are also equally "central planning" of the size of the limit. Which makes your argument moot.
No book is going to save you from making a silly argument. If it's wrong it's wrong, and yours is wrong. Have a good day and I hope you understand whatever book you read next, better.

But that is equally true today for every merchant who accepts fiat via credit card or any other kind of fiat bank account to bank account transfer. If the money comes from a criminal, then that is knowable to the authorities and they can force the bank to take action against the merchant just like they can force Coinbase to take action against the merchant if the purchase had been made with bitcoin. 
There is no difference between a bank account and a Coinbase account in this particular kind of situation. They are both obligated to follow the same AML / KYC regulations. 
But maybe you mean that it's easier for Coinbase to follow the source of bitcoin funds in more than just one step than it is for a bank to follow the source of fiat funds in more than just one step? If that is true (I'm not convinced that it is) then the problem isn't with Coinbase but with the much more transparent nature of the blockchain than the legacy banking network. 
The reason I'm not convinced that it's difficult for banks to automatically trace back fiat transactions more than just one step to fiat funds that are known to have been involved in a drug deal, is because I'm guessing that it's currently much more common that bitcoin has been a part of a drug deal than fiat. 
That doesn't mean that it's something wrong with bitcoin. On the contrary. That just means that many criminals have discovered how much better bitcoin is than fiat and that ordinary citizens just haven't discovered that yet. I'm sure a high percentage of the first cars were used by bank robbers too because they could flee the scene of a crime much faster than by horse. But over time, the general population also discovered how much better a car is compared to a horse. So the percentage of cars involved in crimes lowered. I think that percentage for bitcoin will also lower over time. 
But yes, the untracability of bitcoin should be improved and be done by default for the purpose of increasing bitcoin fungibility, and other reasons. I agree with that. A currency with zero fungibility is a currency with zero practical usability and therefore a currency with zero value. If companies are forced to trace back every source of bitcoin in an unlimited amount of steps (which is currently possible to do quickly and easily simply by looking at the public blockchain) then that will cause bitcoin to have zero fungibility. 
So fix the fungibility problem or fix the AML / KYC laws. I think it's easier to fix the fungibility problem. I think fixing that problem would just make companies like Coinbase and Bitpay happy too.

Yeah, just imagine how popular and big Wikipedia would've grown if they had put a DDoS protection limit on it for max 1 million page views per day, and then demanding that users use "off-Wikipedia" solutions for the "less important views and edits". There would never have been a "fee competition" for the privilege to interact with Wikipedia directly. Instead people would've just used some other encyclopedia that offered the exact same thing but without the arbitrary DDoS 1 million views per day limitation.
Bitcoin doesn't exist in a vacuum. It is trivial to create a competitor that is exactly the same but without the 1 MB transaction limit. If the limit isn't raised, people will start using alternatives to Bitcoin. They are not going to use "off-chain" Bitcoin just like they would never have used "off-Wikipedia" Wikipedia. If you want people to use Bitcoin, then you have to let people use Bitcoin. And the way to let them do that is to raise the limit.
People have to have a very good reason to stop using fiat currencies and the incumbent payment systems and start using Bitcoin instead. Just like Bitcoin has a very strong advantage over other cryptocurrencies due to its leading network effect, the fiat currencies have that exact same advantage over Bitcoin. 
"You have to disrupt or die" in this heavy competition currency ecosystem, and you'll only successfully disrupt the incumbents if you have near-zero transaction fees. And you'll only have near-zero transaction fees if you raise the blocksize limit to allow for more transactions to happen on-chain.

Unrelated to the above; has your company made any official statements regarding how you see the block size debate? Breadwallet for example has chosen to officially sign the Bitcoin Core scaling road map document, whereas Coinbase and Bitpay for example has chosen to officially state that they instead believe that a significantly larger block size limit increase will soon be necessary even if Bitcoin Core doesn't agree about that.

Some people want Bitcoin to succeed. Some people want Blockstream to succeed. It's becoming increasingly evident that these are two separate groups of people with different and incompatible goals. 
That's why more and more people are moving away from Bitcoin Core which have at least 9 of their main developers officially employed by the Blockstream company. The business plan for Blockstream has a conflict of interest with the interests of the rest of the Bitcoin project. And now that conflict of interest has spread to the Bitcoin Core project.
This is why you see alternative projects to the Bitcoin Core project gaining more support and users. The dominant market share that Bitcoin Core has currently is only temporary. 
Several people have asked the President of Blockstream Adam Back to officially publish the presentation (PowerPoint document or a presentation video recording) that he has shown to their Venture Capital investors to get their 21 million USD investment. What did they say to their investors to get so much money? How will they return a profit on their investment? 
Adam Back repeatedly ignored the request for transparency. Probably because he is very well aware of the conflict of interest that his company has with the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem.

In your comparison, the wallet is like the web browser. But what are you comparing LN to?  
From my point of view LN is less like HTML5 and more like Adobe Flash.
The community should be working on open standard things like HTML5 (That is; on-chain ordinary bitcoin transactions with a very large block size limit, where the economic majority defines consensus.) instead of adopting proprietary and buggy technologies like Flash (that is; LN developed by only one company, Blockstream.). But I agree that names such as "Lightning Network" sound very flashy, so at least the name is cool.
Letting Blockstream define the bitcoin protocol would be like having let Microsoft define the html protocol back in the day. We would've all been stuck with a very limited IE6 even today, had Microsoft been the only party defining the protocol for everyone else (They tried to "embrace and extend" to capture the protocol, but failed.).
What we need is competing alternatives to Bitcoin Core so that we can get more decentralized development teams and projects. The bitcoin protocol development needs to become decentralized like the development of the html protocol has been.

You willfully misinterpreted what he wrote. Here is the full quote for the needed context:




You (wrote:


Gavin never said that he would remove a 21 million bitcoin limit that is already in place. All he said was that he would have considered to make the initial version with a modest perpetual inflation **but** that the benefit of being able to say "there will never be more than 21 million bitcoin" is so *overwhelmingly heavy* that it outweighs any benefits from having a modest inflation.
Gavin used grammar in a way that makes it possible to turn his grammar against him, and you turned his use of grammar against him. The correct and honest way to interpret what Gavin wrote is that even Gavin himself would definitely have released the initial Bitcoin Core (called "Bitcoin-QT" at the time of the first release) version with a 21 million bitcoin limit. A limit that Gavin would never want to remove.

It's difficult to show clear evidence of that when LN has not yet been released and not yet deployed. Both sides of the debate can only speculate on how the LN hubs are going to work.
However, Bitcoin Core developers are often stating how important they think it is to migrate most of the transactions that are today happening on-chain to instead happen off-chain in the form of LN transactions. They want to change Bitcoin so that it becomes an exclusive settlement network for large value transactions instead of as it has been so far (a transactional network for both large *and* small value transactions).
LN hub operators are not going to provide their services for free. They are going to have to put a lot of their own bitcoin online so that ordinary users can use their hubs. They will be expecting a fee for using their hubs. If the vast majority of future transactions are going to happen on the LN instead of on-chain as today, then the vast majority of the fees paid will also move there. The fees go where the transactions are. If you use the Visa network you pay your fees to Visa not to Mastercard, and vice versa.
So why will there only be one main hub that almost everyone will be using? Well, there's a natural centralizing effect for the LN hub network because using more than just one hub will need more LN channels to be created and every time you create or close a channel you have to make a new (and expensive due to the 1 000 000 bytes limit and presumably high demand) on-chain transaction. 
Hub operators and ordinary bitcoin users are going to avoid doing things that create very expensive on-chain transactions so they will tend to want to connect only to large LN hubs.
We think that Blockstream is planning on becoming the largest LN hub so that they can become the entity that collects most of the Bitcoin fees. Their detailed business plan as presented to their investors is private so we can only speculate on its actual content. 
We asked Adam Back several times to show us at least the Powerpoint presentation that he has been using to pitch the Blockstream business plan to their VC investors. 
He has chosen to ignore those requests despite great public interest. So we don't have any evidence to show besides making our own analysis and evaluation of the situation. If it smells like a business plan, tastes like a business plan and looks like a business plan, then it probably is a business plan.
I don't think it's "bad" of Blockstream to try to extract fees from the Bitcoin network. It's just business. They saw an opportunity and went for it. We independent Bitcoin users are of course incentivized to approve of changes in the protocol that lowers the fees instead of making them higher by introducing a new middleman (the LN hub operator instead of transacting directly on-chain). Every bitcoin Blockstream extracts in profit from the system is one bitcoin less for the rest of us. It does not make us neither "good" nor "bad" for demanding that Bitcoin remains fast (no Full RBF) and cheap (allow the 1 000 000 bytes transactional area limit of the block to be increased to support a higher direct on-chain tps capacity).
Most (almost all) of us welcome the LN to become an intimate part of the Bitcoin network. But we demand that the direct on-chain capacity is raised as well because we believe that this is possible but that Blockstream are trying to make us stop using cheaper on-chain transactions. We believe that Blockstream instead want us to start using more expensive LN transactions where Blockstream will become the main hub and collect most of the fees. That's why we protest and make demands in various ways with various possible consequences.
If Blockstream would not have tried to make changes that in our view makes Bitcoin slower (Full RBF) and more expensive (intentionally keeping the blocksize limit unnecessarily low) then we would not have considered Blockstream to be acting against our financial interests. As it looks today though, we believe that Blockstream is doing this so that we will have even more reasons to start using their future dominant LN hub instead of transacting directly on the blockchain as we always have so far.
**tldr:** I don't have any proof on what Blockstream's detailed business plan is (We asked for their powerpoint they show their VC investors but they won't release it.). All I have is speculation that seems to fit very well with their observed behavior.

We care about increasing the 1 000 000 bytes blocksize limit to a 2 000 000 bytes limit though a direct hard fork. 
We are willing to use Segwit activation as a bargaining chip to get what we want and we believe that Bitcoin Core will accept our demand. 
We believe that the end result is that we will be getting both a 2 000 000 bytes direct limit and an additional 80 % indirect limit increase through Segwit.

That's why I wrote that I believe that miners will choose mutual cooperation (and collectively punishing defectors) with only a 75 % probability. I'm not 100 % certain. I as a test subject am not a researcher. All I did was to share my anecdotal observations from memory. Someone who has studied game theory for many years should spend some time analyzing the miners' game and share their conclusions and opinions about probable current and future miner behavior regarding 0-conf tx's.
With that said, I'm not [appealing to authority]( either. Nobel prize winning people (in economics[1]) such as Paul Krugman for example are fully capable to misunderstand how Bitcoin works. But a person who is *not* a Nobel prize winner (like I assume all of us Bitcoin enthusiasts) is *also* capable of misunderstanding how Bitcoin works. And as a very skilled programmer, so are you. 
That's why universities spend a lot of time, money and effort funding such experiments even today. It's difficult to predict human behavior from theory alone.
My point was that many games tend to evolve a cooperative behavior where defectors are punished. And I think that Bitcoin mining is one such game and my guess is that I'm 75 % likely to be right about that. But again, I'm self-taught and by no means any kind of expert of [game theory]( But neither are people who work on the Bitcoin Core project (such as yourself), and certainly not Peter Todd.
Yes, I know that there is no *actual* [Nobel prize of Economics]( but you know what I mean.
I've watched that Russel Crowe [movie]( read [two]( [books]( and participated as a test subject for 5 hours in total. And that's about it. Total amount of time spent and experience, probably just one month.  
But enough to see when people who are claiming absolute "facts" are likely [out of their element]( and probably wrong.

I am just an independent Bitcoin user. I believe that I represent the economic majority of Bitcoin users as well as the majority of Bitcoin Classic supporters, with the statements that I have made today in this subreddit. I do not represent the opinions of Bitcoin Core supporters. 
We are not centrally organized but our opinion matters more than other organizations' and economical actors' opinions because if you don't meet our demands when we have them, then we will sell our bitcoin to then either keep them as fiat currency or buy other forms of assets or cryptocurrencies. 
You need us and our support or your Bitcoin currency will become worthless. 
The miners know this and we believe that they are on our side and that they will become even more on our side in the short term future. That's why they demanded to have the Bitcoin Core project representatives to join them for negotiations with a short notice in the Hong Kong "Bitcoin Roundtable Consensus" meeting. 
The agreement states the 2 000 000 bytes direct hard fork demand from the majority of miners. If the Bitcoin Core project managers don't fulfill that demand then the miners will abandon the Bitcoin Core altclient in favor of the Bitcoin Classic altclient.

The service you're referring to seems to have shut down their service. The site now says:


You wrote:


**Iterative Game Theory games are significantly different than one-off Game Theory games. People playing the two different categories of games tend to play them very differently. Bitcoin mining happens to be an iterative Game Theory kind of game, but the way you're reasoning about how miners are likely to behave in the future is based on one-off games.**
These are some of the significant characteristics: 
The game is played with the same players over and over again once every 10 minutes on average. Each move by each player is publicly published for every player to see after each round. There is a built-in ability to punish misbehaving players (by orphaning their blocks) where each punishment is not anonymous and immediately known by all players. These characteristics alters the decision making behavior of all players significantly.
I've been a voluntary test subject in a local university here in Sweden where they tested students' decision making behavior in many games with minor changes in the rules. The players did not know each other beforehand and there was a small monetary reward (about 5 - 20 USD possible per player per hour) depending on how well the player played. 
I've participated in about 50 games (for about 5 hours in total, one hour per day) with the rules changed for each game and 4-8 real people per playing group.
Two things where unexpected and surprising to me:
1. People care a lot about getting paid real money even if the sums are very small. They treat the games not as games but as a real way of making real money. Making money was their only objective and no one cared about the scenario description that was often something like:  
"Imagine that you're a mayor of s small city and you have to regulate businesses in your city. You have 3 cities adjacent to your city and all of you are competing with tax policies and environmental regulation policies. What do you do, if a, b, and c did this or that?". They did not try to play the role of an actual mayor.  
They played with the intent of making as close to 20 USD for the day as possible even though it was obvious no actual mayor would make similar moves in reality.
2. People very quickly develop a cooperative behavior even when it pays more to defect when the other players cooperate. They do this in about 75 % of all games and game groups after only 3 - 10 moves.
Some games quickly deteriorated in everyone defecting on every move and getting a small real payout at the end of the 1 hour session. I tried to remember what those games had in common (We were there for the purpose of being test subjects and were not allowed to take notes because that could affect our future behavior.) because I just happened to also be interested in game theory myself.
From my memory I can say that the games that tended to deteriorate were the games where the players' moves where not public to other players. Then the other players did not have a way to know which other player to punish (for defecting) in the next move.
The characteristics of Bitcoin players (the miners) just happen to be very similar to those games I've participated in where cooperation quickly evolved. I haven't researched game theory so I can't *prove* the future behavior of Bitcoin miners, but in my experience as a test subject playing these kinds of games, I can say that I'm 75 % convinced that the miners are going to choose to cooperate instead of to defect in their constantly on-going game of mining.
In conclusion I'll claim that most people involved in Bitcoin today are either programmers or economists. When I read peoples comments about how they expect miners to behave I've not seen even one person who seems to be formally educated in the scientific field of game theory. 
**tldr: Everyone is just more or less guessing what they expect that the miners will do. I'm guessing too and I have no formal education in anything so I'm not saying that I know better than anyone else discussing and debating this topic.**
**But according to my experiences from being a test subject in about 50 simulated games I can say that I believe that there is a 75 % probability that the Bitcoin miners are going to choose to cooperate regarding not abusing Full RBF by defecting for short term gain. This is because the game of mining is iterative and has other characteristics similar to games I've played where cooperation evolved after just 3-10 moves.**
**A "Tragedy of the Commons" is far from certain (my personal guess just 25 %) given the characteristics of the type of game that Bitcoin mining is. If it would happen then it should have happened by now even though the mining fees / block are comparatively low. Games that will eventually deteriorate in every player defecting on every move tend to deteriorate after just 3-10 moves (3-10 mined blocks in the game of mining). Behavior emerges quicker than often expected.**

No. Once 750 of the 1 000 last blocks indicate that BIP109 is supported, then the miners will assume that BIP109 is supported and BIP109 will be considered to have been activated. 28 days later the miners will assume that the majority side of the network will accept blocks that are larger than 1 000 000 bytes. Then they will create the first larger block.

We believe that that is an unlikely scenario. We believe that once 75 % of the global hashing power has voted to activate then the hard fork that will occur 28 days later will be successful and that the clear majority of the Bitcoin will continue to function properly.
You're describing a scenario that is very unlikely in my opinion. It's almost comparable to the scenario where a lot of Hillary Clinton supporters vote for her opposition Donald Trump with a secret plan to overthrow the government once Donald Trump has won the election. Sure it could happen but it's very unlikely. What's much more likely is that everyone votes for the candidate they actually support and don't vote for their opposition.

I for example will never be voting on that site because that site requires me to take my bitcoin out of cold storage before I can use them to vote with. I'm not going to do that just to vote. 
If I ever take all my bitcoin out of cold storage at once, the purpose will not be to vote on that site but to sell them.

Bitcoin Classic and BIP109 both require 75 % of the last 1 000 blocks to vote yes before activation will happen. There will be a grace period of 28 days after activation has occurred to give everyone who has not already upgraded, time to upgrade. 
Personally I think a 75 % majority vote is safe enough to make changes to the protocol. Otherwise (with a 95 % vote requirement) it only takes 5 % of the votes to veto any change from ever happening. That too would not be good.
Tldr: It's not 70 %. It's 75 % and also a 28 days grace period to give everyone plenty of time to upgrade.

Miners are not anonymous. They are pseudonymous. It is possible to single out one misbehaving miner and punish that miner by orphaning that miner's block(s) even without knowing who the human behind that ip address is. So my point still stands.
@_date: 2015-08-08 17:42:41
I agree. I use [Kepass]( for almost all of my passwords. That way I can have a different (and randomly generated) password for every website etc. 
But the password for cold storage bitcoin wallets should in my opinion be stored only in a human brain and nowhere else. 
Possibly printed out as a paper wallet hidden at a random location a bit away from your home (or a bank deposit box if you have one), if you don't trust your own memory or don't want to practice remembering your password at least once a month (You must practice or *you will* forget.). Just remember that paper wallets can be lost if for example some construction company decides to build a building right on top of the place where you dug your hole for storing your printed paper password (or a part of your password so no one can randomly find and misuse it).
If you want your family to be able to inherit your bitcoin in case you get run-over by a bus while thinking deeply about your passwords and not looking, you can give half of the password to each family member, and half of the password to be included in your testament. That way your lawyer can't just take your bitcoin even after you've died. Only your family can take them, and only after you've died. Or even better if you store your bitcoin in an [m-of-n wallet]( But experiment with small amounts first no matter what method you may choose.
Whatever you do, choose a testament solution that makes it possible for your relatives to make several mistakes and not lose all of the inherited coins in just one mistake. Don't just assume that they know what they're doing when they try to handle large amounts of bitcoin. Remember that you're unfortunately no longer available for phone support. If you give them just one private key that controls all of the bitcoin, then they may lose everything in just one second if they swipe the key into on a computer with wallet software that has malware installed on it without them knowing it. It's better to have the bitcoin stored in more than one bitcoin address so that they get another chance if they notice that they lost coins not understanding why they lost them. If all goes well (they lose no coins), they'll hate you for having complicated things for them by splitting coins into several addresses instead of just one, but it won't matter because you're dead anyway.
Also, do all of this *before* your cold storage bitcoin savings have become worth a lot of money (assuming bitcoin will continue to rise very much in value over the years to come). It's much better to move around bitcoin that is worth a little than having to move them around when they are already worth a lot of money. Everyone makes mistakes. So make them while they're still cheap.


Mostly because I didn't know what it was until you asked me "why not". (So thanks for mentioning it. TIL.)  
But after googling [diceware]( I agree that using Diceware would be a very similar thing to do. However, you get an additional small benefit of not having to trust the person who wrote your diceware software that you're using. A wooden dice and a paper dictionary can never secretly send every word you look up to a malicious receiver through the internet. If it's easy to not take a small risk, then why take a small risk? It pains my geeky heart to admit it, but sometimes there is a benefit to use a primitive technology rather than an advanced technology. The best solutions use a clever combination of both.

Well, then it seems that we are not disagreeing as much as it first seemed. It seems as if the core difference in our views is how we view the 1 MB blocksize limit - is it a core consensus feature or is it "a bug that needs fixing"?
You seem to regard it as more of the former and I more of the latter.
So why do I consider it to be "a bug"? Well, because there was a time before the 1 MB limit was implemented (coincidentally through a hard fork). The original idea of core consensus rules for the one and only bitcoin branch was that there should be no limit to the maximum blocksize at all. That moment in time is when the bitcoin project attracted its first significant number of users, advocates and investors. 
After that, Satoshi implemented a 1 MB limit for the purpose of prohibiting spam attacks. The intention (and reason for making the implementation) was never to ensure a large decentralization of nodes. Satoshi didn't think so, and no one else at that time thought so. Therefore no one protested the, in effect, core consensus rule change. It was implied that the limit was only there to prevent potential blocksize bloat spam attacks.
So, when suddenly a few people started proclaiming that the purpose of the 1 MB limit was to stimulate an increase in the number of nodes and therefore node decentralization, most old and current users said "Hold on a minute, this is not the original purpose of the limit, and also not the reason I got interested in bitcoin. This is not the consensus. This is actually a change to the consensus we've had so far.".
So keeping the max blocksize at a size that defends against blocksize bloat spam attacks is keeping consensus. Changing the purpose of the limit is changing the consensus. If we keep the consensus, we must also keep increasing the limit so that it only has the originally agreed upon purpose which is to defend against spam. Stimulating node decentralization is another kind of blocksize limit and is a separate issue and must be regarded as such, or else we are making consensus-breaking changes.

Technically any code change that causes a hard fork, will also create a new altchain and altcoin. We can't consider bitcoin to have died every time it gets replaced by a new version after a hard fork has occurred. That has happened several times before for other reasons and we still view the current bitcoin version to be the "true" bitcoin version. 
Bitcoin is what the majority of its users consider it to be. All other versions of it are the altcoins. The majority of users already seem to prefer a version of bitcoin with increased max blocksize over the current version with the 1 MB blocksize limit. That makes the version with increased max blocksize the "real" bitcoin, and the current limited version an altcoin. 
So if you want to censor altcoins on then censor the currently deployed 1 MB version, because it will soon be obsoleted and abandoned and in effect become an altcoin if a few people keep using it. But ideally, don't censor any of these two "altcoins" because both versions are very on topic in this discussion forum.

I'd say "discuss the proposal if you disagree, don't censor discussion about the proposal.".
The only way to be able to make wise decisions is to be informed about the issues. The only way to be informed about the issues is through discussing the issues before forming an opinion. The only way to discuss the issues is by not censoring the discussion. 
The only way to approach a consensus as close as possible, is by allowing discussion so that as many people as possible can get as informed and therefore wise as possible. Censoring discussion about different proposals regarding the future maximum bitcoin blocksize is what's dangerous for bitcoin. It's not a proposal in itself that is dangerous.
The least dangerous path forward is to allow discussion of proposals, not censor the discussions and some of the proposals. If a proposal is "stupid", it should be downvoted by the forum community and not censored by a forum mod. Don't centralize the opinions.

The difference between a hardfork and a softfork is difficult to understand for me, so I quite often use the wrong term as I don't quite understand the difference yet. I've read  but still don't understand it. With that said, I still maintain that the (small) point I was trying to make when I used the term "hard fork" would still stand even if I would've used the more general term "fork" without specifying the type of fork. I'll keep googling the terms and see if I find a text that even I can understand.


What do you think of the proposed sizes in [BIP101]( (8 MB initially, and double every 2 years)? I currently believe that BIP101 is the best way forward for bitcoin. There is always the option for each miner to mine smaller blocks than 8 MB if they think it'll benefit them even when the max limit would be 8 MB.  
My reason for believing that the self-regulation would not become a problem in this scenario is because I haven't heard of any such problems when the typical size of a block was 100 KB with a max limit of 1 MB. But I do acknowledge that that reason is not a proof that there would not appear any problems that I just haven't thought of yet. Have you thought of or read about any potential problems in this case?


I agree. I currently think that the BIP101 is the best way forward, but am willing to change my opinion and even make reasonable compromises, like for example 4 MB initial limit instead of 8 and doubling every third instead of every second year. An initial limit of 2 MB I wouldn't compromise with (Though it should be said that I'm just a random bitcoin user and not even a miner. I do volunteer running a node on my home connection just to make an admittedly  small contribution to the network.), but I'd consider many possible compromises even if I'd personally have other preferences.

He suggested using mostly *seemingly* random password components for creating a *seemingly* random password. The only way to get *real* entropy for a brainwallet password is to only use random words that all of them are the output of a good RNG source. 
As one example of why using the first name of family members as a password component source is worse than using truly random components is that the majority of families share a very common list of first names and combinations of first names. The number of needed password guesses are actually much smaller than it feels. 
But most importantly is the fact that **huge lists of people's passwords are leaked regularly**, which gives crackers a very good tool in their efforts to guess passwords. How do you know that your method to create your seemingly random password and your choice of password components, are uniquely used by only you and not by another human being on this planet?
**We humans have a feeling that our thoughts are much more special and unique than they actually are.** The odds that a seemingly random series of thoughts have been thought by at least one other human, in the exact same order is actually surprisingly high. Heck, even entire inventions (like the invention of the light bulb) are thought of at the same time, but only one of the inventors gets famous so the thought seems unique when it's actually not. 
Why is a truly random password important? Because a computer program, not humans, is used to guess passwords, and computers can guess and try passwords extremely fast. **It can try every password in a previously leaked password list very fast without needing to understand the reasoning that was used to create them.** Your opponent may seem human but is actually their computer. They're very good at doing the same thing over and over again, like going through a list is. 
**Don't use your seemingly random thoughts as a source for creating your password.** Use truly random words from a list of truly random words, chosen by a RNG that is known to be good.
**I'd recommend** using the "correct horse battery staple" method (google "correct horse battery staple") a wooden dice and one ordinary paper book dictionary. Then do this to get really random password components of which to create your password from:
1) Throw your dice 3 times. Look up the page number in your paper dictionary, that has the same 3 digit number. Now you're on a truly random page.  
2) Throw your dice 2 times. Let's say you got 38 for example. Look up the 38th word on that page. Let's say the word happens to be "fantastic". Then "fantastic" is your first password component. Write it down on a paper.  
3) Do you have 4 words yet? If you don't, go to step 1) again and repeat the instructions. If you have 4 words, that means you have all of your necessary password components to be able to construct your fairly easy-to-remember password, for example "fantastic job well done".  
**This way, you now have a truly and not just seemingly easy-to-remember password ("fantastic job well done").** You didn't have to trust anyone's RNG program because you used a physical wooden dice and a physical paper dictionary instead of a computer program to create your password.
A 4-word truly random password should be enough for any usual purposes like your Facebook password for example, **but please use at least 12 words if your password is used to protect your bitcoin contained in a brainwallet.**
I recommend 12 words because the Mycelium wallet uses 12 words as a minimum for their HD wallet password seed phrase, and I've heard of no one complaining about their Mycelium seed password being cracked. They use fewer possible words than a whole dictionary, so while 12 may be the minimum for them, less than 12 may be the minimum if you use a whole dictionary for your possible words. 
But I've only used reasoning not mathematics to reach my conclusion of the minimum number of words, so I don't know how much smaller that number could be and my recommendation must therefore remain "at least 12 words".

@_date: 2015-08-09 03:41:20
Let's make these assumptions:
1. There are 600 000 possible words in the English language.  
2. You choose 12 of those words *randomly* (with a dice or something like that).  
3. The statement "You can still calculate hundreds of thousands or potentially even millions of dictionary attacks per second on Brainwallets." from the parent comment is correct.
Then we can calculate how many seconds it should take to guess one 12-word-long password seed:
( (600 000)^12 ) / 10^6 = 2.17678 * 10^63 seconds. That's a huge number of seconds, even if we assume that the computer can make 1 000 000 guesses per second.
So, how many years are 2.17678 * 10^63 seconds?
( 2.17678 * 10^63 ) / 60 / 60 / 24 / 365 = 6.90252 * 10^55 years. That's a huge number of years.
So you would be safe in your case.
The problem is that people in general didn't choose that many words, and that the few words they actually chose "felt" random but were not *actually* random because they used only their brains to choose them. Brains cannot without tools choose truly random words. Brains suck at randomness but are excellent at making you feel that they are superb at randomness. Some people know this, but most don't, and believe that their passwords are much harder to guess (for computers) than they actually are. It's one of those strange moments when the best advice would be to *not* try to use your brain.
@_date: 2015-08-08 23:00:23
The number of words in the English language are approximately [600 000](  
If you choose a password which contains only one dictionary word, a computer has to guess which one you chose from a list of 600 000 other words.  
If you choose a password which contains two dictionary words, a computer has to guess which two you chose from a list of 600 000 other words, but with a total possible combinations of 600 000 * 600 000 = 360 * 10^9. So the computer would have to make 360 * 10^9 guesses instead of just 600 000 guesses because your password contains two random words instead of just one random word.
If you choose a password which contains three dictionary words, the number will be 600 000 * 600 000 * 600 000 = 216 * 10^15 necessary guesses.
If you choose a password which contains **four truly random dictionary words**, the number will be 600 000^4 = **129 * 10^21 necessary guesses**.
If you choose a password which contains five dictionary words, the number will be 600 000^5 = 77 * 10^27 necessary guesses.
The point is that it's just as easy to remember four truly random words as it is to remember four truly random letters. But four truly random words are much more difficult for a computer to guess than four truly random letters. How much more difficult?
There are only 26 possible letters in the English alphabet. So if you create a password with **four truly random letters**, a computer has to guess only 26^4 = **456 976 times**, which is much less than 129 * 10^21 guesses.
There are only 10 possible "numbers" (as you called it) in the English alphabet, (which are 0-9). So if you create a password with **four truly random numbers**, a computer has to guess only 10^4 = **10 000 times**, which is much less than 129 * 10^21 guesses.
[The U.S. Census Bureau statistics tell us that there are at least 151,671 different last names and 5,163 different first names in common use in the United States]( 151 671 + 5 163 = 156 834 possible names in total.
So, let's say you have a list of all of those names in a "dictionary of only names", and choose one of those names truly randomly from that list. Then a computer would have to guess 156 834 times to guess your one-name-long password.
So if you create a password with **four truly random names**, a computer has to guess only 156 834^4 = **605 * 10^18 times**, which is a lot of times, but still much less than 129 * 10^21 guesses.


That depends on how large your list of possible special characters is. Do you want to allow your password to contain odd characters such as " ' ", " \` " or " § "? Or just characters such as " ! ", " ? " or " &amp; "? Make a list of your possible special characters and count how many they are. If they are less than 26 unique characters, then creating a password that consists of four such characters would be no more difficult for a computer to guess than an ordinary four letter password would be to guess. It would be more difficult for a human to guess, because who knows how to even type the " ` " character, right? But for a computer that is just a character just like for example the "a" character is.
Let's say you want to create a password that contains only truly random lowercase letters and numbers. The password will consist of four characters, **for example "a3b8"**. That would give you 26 possible letters and 10 possible numbers, which would make a list of 26 + 10 = 36 possible characters.
So if you create a password with **four truly random such characters**, a computer has to guess only 36^4 = **1 679 616 times**, which is much less than 129 * 10^21 guesses.

Also, why give the spread to a competitor (Itbit) when you can keep the spread yourself (Gemini) as an additional profit.
If you're almost done opening your own exchange (Gemini) that is required for the ETF application to get approved, and an alternative exchange that would also be allowed by the SEC unexpectedly opens (Itbit), then why complicate and delay things further by making changes to the ETF application forms?  
It was probably deemed faster to just keep the ETF application as it already is and finish with the last steps in creating Gemini. I'm just speculating, of course, but it seems like a reasonable speculation to be made.

Well, in my opinion, yes actually. If 90 % of users want to increase the cap from 21 million to 42 million, then we should go ahead and make that change.
One of the main reasons that the bitcoin system is so beautiful in its design, is that the incentives that are built-in into the system makes such an opinion vanishingly unlikely to ever reach anywhere near a majority. 
Understanding these incentives is what makes it possible to trust that the 21 million cap is extremely likely to remain forever. Ensuring such a cap has historically before bitcoin was invented, never been possible because the incentives to "keep printing money" have always been overwhelmingly positive. 
That's because the "printing of money" has always been a centralized process controlled by the few to the detriment of the many, whereas in the bitcoin system this process and control is decentralized and controlled by the many. That fundamentally changes the incentives to want to keep the cap at 21 million. 
So, who should do the voting? Practically speaking the only ones who can vote in a way that is not sensitive to "sybil attacks" are the miners due to "proof of work" making sybil attacks not possible. So while it seems unfair that exchanges, node operators, merchants and ordinary users are not allowed to vote, the miners can't actually ignore those people. They have to carefully consider the desires of every other type of network participant, because if everyone but the miners disagree with the miners, then a hard fork will happen and the miners will soon find that they are mining blocks that no significant amount of actual people are using. 
So, the miners are incentivized to vote with the whole system in mind. It's difficult to replace the miners, but they're not irreplaceable, and they and the other types of network participants all know that. In a way, the miners are just glorified number crunchers. At the same time, the bitcoin system cannot function without such number crunchers. 
So the system should be stable. I'm writing "should" because I constantly surprise myself by being wrong about things, so copy my reasoning at your own risk. In fact, I'm often finding myself in the kitchen not remembering why I went there. So it's important that you think through the system yourself before you choose to trust it. I've chosen to trust it quite a bit despite the risks. Good luck (to us all).

US 2008 and contemporary Greek banks were both regulated, but have the benefit of eternal bailouts when they would otherwise have failed.  
Mtgox didn't have governmental bailouts and were forced to close after they had failed. Regulation doesn't stop banks from failing. Regulation stops innovation and competition. Remove bailouts for fiat banks and they'll fail just as often (despite being regulated) as exchanges like Mtgox fail. 
Regulation (together with the implied promise of bailouts) is just a way to privatize profits while socializing the risks and subsequent costs, and artificially protecting incumbents from yet unestablished competition.
It would be better to remove both regulations and bailouts. Then banks and exchanges would likely not have an opportunity to grow so large that failing would cause systemic risk. If they would take unreasonable risks, then they would've failed before reaching the size of posing systemic risk. 
It's better to have many banks and regular bank failures of a few of the banks, than have a few banks and rare but complete system crashes. This is especially true when the world has only one global and intimately interconnected economy. In this case a systemic crash will be much more severe because all countries' economies will fail within a very short time frame, just after one of them fails.

Are you sure about that? I thought a company only had to get a bitlicense if their business holds funds on the behalf of their customers, and that Shapeshift doesn't hold either customers' fiat or customers' cryptocurrencies. 
As far as I understood, Shapeshift acts like a broker, not like an exchange. And by "broker" I mean that each deal is made between the customer and Shapeshift, not between the customer and another customer. In this case Shapeshift would not be required to apply for the bitlicense,  right?

If I may ask you a question personally after watching your lecture video:
You mention that there are five actors that need to agree on a change in consensus rules. 1. Miners, 2. Exchanges, 3. Wallets, 4. Merchants, and i forgot the fifth. You also said that while electricity prices are low in China due to government subsidies, they have access to a relatively low amount of bandwidth. Most of the bitcoin mining today happen in China due to low electricity cost and a low (1 MB) maximum blocksize, making the negative effect of low Chinese bandwidth a quite small of a problem for them. 
I remember a Reddit discussion where most Chinese miners signed a letter claiming that they've agreed to not wanting to upgrade the maximum blocksize beyond the initial 8 MB per block, whereas Gavin et al's BIP suggestion was to make that 8 MB max size increase automatically over the years, beyond the initial increase to 8 MB. 
**What in your opinion would happen to the Bitcoin network as a whole if this were to become a major disagreement between Chinese miners and the rest of the five consensus rules actors (Chinese miners rejecting any future blocks that are larger than 8 MB, never increasing that 8 MB limit ever.)?** Could you please describe what you'd think would happen step by step, in a similar manner as you described how forks have happened historically in the network, as you did in the linked lecture youtube video?

My point was that we don't need consensus to move forward with new decisions, such as increasing the maximum blocksize. If a large majority (say maybe 90 or 95 %) wants to change the code to allow larger blocksize, then we should go ahead and make the forking change despite not having reached a 100 % consensus first. 
The 5 or 10 % of people who disagreed will very quickly agree with the new version of bitcoin, or they will find themselves isolated on a version of bitcoin that no one but themselves are using. 
The proposal being censored by the mods of has a built-in preprogrammed method of safely making the change from today's small blocks to future larger ones. There will be no change according to the proposal if not a large majority (75 %(?)) of the users would agree to make the change. And yet, the proposal is being censored by the mods in this forum. 
Building a complex system such as bitcoin is difficult and risky enough as it is, and as a community we need to be able to make as informed decisions as possible. The only way to get informed is by not censoring discussions or proposals. Uninformed decision making and uninformed voting on code changes, is what's dangerous for bitcoin. Not a concrete proposal such as BIP101.

"You can't actually, this particular statement was a bit of a stretch. Given a bit stream and an alphabet of 128 distinct symbols, you can replace chunks of 7 consecutive bits with one of these symbols. 256 bytes equals 2048 bits, divided by 7 equals about 293 symbols.
Conversely, 15 emoticons can just encode 15 * 7 = 105 bits (13.125 bytes). Nevertheless this speech is a total blast."

Thanks for replying but my "why" wasn't actually a question. It was intended as a joke.

So instead of writing "what", "[wut]( or similar like the common phrase would be when something is really confusing, I wrote "why" as a way to continue the confusion in the same way as the parent comment started. Why continue the same confusion? Because it would be a way of indirectly confirming that I saw what he did there, which in itself would be a continuation of the same. Unexpected loops tend to be funny.
Most attempts at humor stops being funny the moment someone explains the funny, so don't worry that you still don't find what I wrote to be funny. Or my attempt at humor simply wasn't funny to begin with, which is certainly also a possibility.

That's almost 5 times faster than would be expected. I can think of two possible reasons. 
1. The mining collective happened to find blocks 5 times faster than average (with many transactions waiting in the mempool) during the time that he happened to be measuring. 
Or 2. He hadn't been running his node for a while, started it, and quickly downloaded many old blocks to get caught up with the latest blocks again, affecting his average download speed to be higher than usual. Most likely of the two reasons, I'd guess.

I haven't read the paper, but am guessing "forward looking privacy" refers to this quote from the abstract: 
"In a hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet, child private keys are generated pseudorandomly from a master private key, and **the corresponding child public keys can be generated by anyone with knowledge of the master public key.**"
So if I would give you my HD wallet's master public key, you would be able to know every future public key that I would ever create using that wallet seed, thus unintentionally causing me to lose my "forward looking privacy" to you.

[Yes]( we can. Personally, I don't think there is a way to know whether bitcoin will remain the dominant cryptocurrency or not. I follow the news every day and constantly re-evaluate what odds I believe that bitcoin may or may not be out-competed by a future alternative cryptocurrency. I don't think there is an easy answer to this complex question. There are so many variables to consider, many of which probably haven't even been invented yet.
It's easy to accurately predict the future in retrospect. But that is not actually predicting the future. A common argument that bitcoin will remain the most used cryptocurrency is that "not even ipv6 has been able to replace ipv4" due to the entrenched [network effect]( of the widely used ipv4. When the internet protocol became used by mainstream people the version number was ipv4. There exists an upgraded version of the internet protocol called ipv6, but it's almost never used because changing everything would be so much work, so people just keep using the "good old ipv4".
It's easy to look back at history and say that it's obvious that no successful competitor to the internet would ever cause people to stop using the internet and start using the competing computer network instead. This is called [confirmation bias]( and is very common especially when your only source of knowledge and insight is reading about history but where you lack personal experience from participating directly in those historical events.
An example I often think about when I feel I may be tricking myself into believing something to be true, when in fact I'm just fooling myself due to confirmation bias, is when there was a great fear among the public caused by the [Year 2000 problem](
I remember my co-workers discussing the severity of the problem especially late in 1999. I worked at an IT-company and about half of the employees thought that there would be serious problems. Maybe even causing riots if the sensitive computer programs that were being used to coordinate food supply and transportation to grocery stores deep inside cities would be interrupted.
Some of them withdrew a couple of weeks worth of salary in cash even, just to have cash in case the ATMs would stop working. Some even went so far as to buy a few days of canned food just in case of chaos. So no more than about 50 % of my co-workers thought that there would be no significant problems at all.
About six months after 2000-01-01 and no significant problems had occurred, someone made fun of one of the guys for being stupid thinking that the Y2K bug would've ever caused any problems and that the society had wasted all of that time and money trying to correct all the software at the time so it would not crash at midnight 2000-01-01.
That was confirmation bias right there.
All of a sudden 95 % of those same people thought that the Y2K problem had been exaggerated and a wasteful endeavour. Cobol programmers were ridiculed (Most of the most sensitive systems had their programs written in the Cobol language at the time.).
But I actually tested one of my local ATMs at about 00:45 and it didn't work. The guy who sold gas to me had to use the old method of making a paper copy of my debit card "because there was a problem with the computers" he said. So I'd say it was a close call despite all those many man-hours that had been spent globally correcting all of those errors. What would've happened if no one had taken the Y2K problem seriously? I think that would have been so problematic that people today would've said "but of course there were riots". "The stupid politicians and economists just didn't see the problem that the rest of us clearly saw". Again, there would've been confirmation bias.
So, I'm very careful to just assume that the same thing that caused everyone to use the internet instead of competitors to the internet, will also surely cause everyone to use bitcoin instead of a future competitor to bitcoin. Assuming that would be a form of confirmation bias.
With that said, I still hold mainly bitcoin with a tiny percentage of namecoin as a hedge if it would turn out I'm wrong about bitcoin. Those are the only two cryptocurrencies I've ever invested in.
**tldr: I don't know, and I think that question is too complex for anyone to know.** Be careful with confirmation bias from other similar historical events, and invest in bitcoin only what you're comfortable losing. Bitcoin can replace the USD as the reserve currency, but can also itself be replaced by any future invention or fail for any other reason due to the high complexity of the question, causing bitcoin's value to crash to zero. We can't know, so invest carefully, but do invest at least what you consider to be a little. Bitcoin is an exciting invention with the same disruptive potential as the internet invention itself.

Corrections to the above quote:
The parent comment as well as this post's linked youtube video are talking about bitcoin transactions, not about bitcoin addresses.  
So, please ignore point 2 below if you were actually comparing base-58 (bitcoin address encoding) with base-128 (Skype emoji encoding) in which case your statements would be correct (assuming you were referring to the base-58 type of alphanumerics).  
Otherwise, if you were comparing base-256 (8-bit-ASCII encoding) with base-128 (Skype emoji encoding), you may read on for correction number 2.
The ("8-bit-ASCII", to be precise) alphanumerical character set has a size of 256 possible characters.  
The Skype emoji character set has a size of 128 possible characters.
Therefore, you need more Skype emoji characters than you need alphanumerical characters to be able to represent a bitcoin transaction. Interestingly though, not many more. Just a few more. Reasoning, calculation and conclusion below.
[I think you may accidentally have thought that one Skype emoji character represents 128 * 8 = 1024 bits of data, from looking at your reasoning. That is not true. One Skype emoji character represents only 128 bits of data.]
There can be 256 different alphanumerical characters. You need 8 bits (ones or zeros) to be able to represent that many combinations (2^8 = 256).  
There can be 128 different Skype emoji characters. You need 7 bits to be able to represent that many combinations (2^7 = 128).
If we assume one bitcoin transaction needs 250 (8-bit) bytes (which is the same as 250 alphanumerical characters) of data to be valid, we would need 250 * 8 = 2 000 bits of information to be able to represent it.
Would one Skype emoji be able to represent the whole bitcoin transaction? No it wouldn't, because just one Skype emoji can represent only 7 bits of data, but it needs to be able to represent 2 000 bits of data. One emoji represents only 7 bits which is much less than the needed 2 000 bits.
Ok, so would 2 emojis be able to represent the whole bitcoin transaction? No it wouldn't because 2 emojis can represent only 2 * 7 = 14 bits of information. That's still not 2 000 bits.
So, how many emojis would we need then? We would need 2 000 / 7 = 285.7 emojis (so practically speaking, 286 emojis). We can verify that by seeing that 286 emojis * 7 bits = 2 002 bits, which is more than the required minimum of 2 000 bits.
**So even though the Skype emoji character set is half the size (128 bits) of the alphanumerical character set (256 bits), we only need 286 Skype emoji characters to represent a bitcoin transaction that would need 250 alphanumerical characters to do the same. That's just 36 more characters. Pretty unintuitive and cool I'd say :-).**

You sound like a guy that believes in the theory of evolution, Darwinistic as your arguments sound (not that Darwin would agree with you). Then for consistency you should also believe that no life form, Greek or not, would ever intentionally make life decisions that they knew beforehand would ruin their lives to the brink of starvation and homelessness. 
Everyone tries to make their own lives better and some are just not good at it. (I suck at singing for example, and am thankful every day that I don't have to pay my bills by singing.) That is not a valid reason to be mean towards them. Share your knowledge and insights with those in need and you will have created a better society for you yourself as well to live in. 
If everyone would reason like you do, there would be practically no social progress if at all, and today's generation would never have gotten luxurious toys such as computers because we would still be waging pointless wars with each other instead of trying to make a better world for everyone no matter their assumed intelligence. 
You should be greatful your forefathers and contemporaries had and have more compassion than you have. Yes, bad decisions should have bad consequences, but come on, limit ATM withdrawals to only 60 eur per day per citizen? Probably that ATM is out of cash entirely in addition to the capital controls currently being imposed. 
Maybe his refrigerator broke and he can't buy a new one despite having reasonable savings that he is no longer allowed to access? It doesn't take much imagination to find understandable reasons to feel depressed. No refrigerator and a large family equals being if not starving at least feeling hunger. When you're hungry you just order a pizza, but credit cards don't work in Greece at the moment, so that's not an option either. 
You probably have benefitted your whole life from cheap meat and vegetables people like him have been producing in a cutthroat global market place and price competition. No wonder you have had the time to read one fancy book and make better financial decisions while he has been busy producing your cheap food for you. The problem isn't the Greek pensioner. The problem is systemic, and on a global scale. It's not even your fault ;).

A currency is not a reserve currency forever, if you [look at history]( with a sufficient many years back.

**What happened to Digg seems to be happening to Reddit nowadays. After enough years has passed, it's likely to happen to Voat as well.** Every forum starts uncensored and community friendly, but over time the corporation that runs it tends to get greedier and greedier to increase their ad revenues from operating the forum site of the day. 
Censoring controversial forum posts and comments pleases the advertisers that pay the corporation that runs the forum service. It seems almost inevitably tempting to company management to try to boost ad revenue by censoring "just a little", and then "just a little more, because it obviously works".
Voat.co may be a good alternative to Reddit for a few years up to maybe a decade. But as long as the structure of the entity (a corporation in these cases) that runs the forum remains the same, the outcome is likely to also turn out to be the same. I donated a little to Voat just to support a less censored alternative until someone invents a more censorship resistant kind of forum that can successfully compete with the solutions we've seen until today. 
But just as I expected it to be only a matter of time before Reddit turned into the Digg it once replaced, I expect Voat to eventually turn into the Reddit that it seems to be in the process of replacing today. I'm curious to how a decentralized version of a Reddit-like forum might or might not function, as [mentioned]( by the OP to this thread ( and 
One thing that drew my attention was that the owner of Voat wrote about patents that he was getting for some features of his newly created forum. He didn't mention how he was planning on using those patents or why he applied for them. I don't remember the source for this, so you may have to double-check my memory in regard to such patents. Almost always when there is no clear statement in regard to a patent policy, the patent holder plans to use their patents offensively and not just defensively.
If the Voat.co owner would publicly and clearly state that he plans to use his patents only defensively if attacked by other patent holders, then I'd feel much more enthusiastic in giving my support to his site. But as I wrote earlier, I'm significantly more curious as to how a decentralized Reddit forum alternative might or might not function. Maybe with a forum solution that isn't owned and ultimately controlled by any one party, the solution will remain censorship free and without intrusive advertisements for more than just a few years.
**tldr: Digg -&gt; Reddit -&gt; Voat -&gt; ??? -&gt; "A decentralized forum solution that no one party owns and controls,** which otherwise eventually tends to lead to **increasing censorship and invasive advertisements** for increased corporate profits.", **maybe possible?**  and  (Maybe? Haven't tried them yet). Voat.co may be good in the meantime.

While your statement is true, it is also true that MySpace was first and Facebook was second. Sometimes there can be an advantage to be second. For example you can learn from your competitor's mistakes so you don't have to make and pay for them yourself. 
Another interesting thing is that being first can be so costly that birds who fly in formation while migrating during season changes, actually take turns being the first bird when flying in the "v" formation. Being the second bird in that flying formation is actually less costly because there is less wind resistance thanks to the first bird taking a larger part of it. 
So they eventually tire and fall back letting another, rested, bird take the first place at least for a while. So never automatically underestimate the second bird. When the race is long, anything can happen. The bitcoin race has just started.

I wonder if a salary that is too low would make it tempting for that manager to try to make some money on the side of the deals he makes on behalf of his employer.
Maybe if the salary is high enough, the salary will contribute in keeping the manager working in the employers interest and not try to make deals that benefit the manager personally in indirect ways instead. I wonder how much the size of the salary affects behavior, basically.

Ok, so a month and a half later the developers of Bitcoin Classic managed to accomplish all of those stages and then they released the first beta source code, with binaries as the next step. Did you expect that there would be no progress *forever*? Upgrading the block size limit from 1 MB to 2 MB is not rocket science.
One and a half months of preparation and work is quite reasonable and sufficient for that type of upgrade. It's a much smaller change than the alternative which would be keeping the 1 MB limit and in doing so introducing a never before seen ECE (Economic Change Event), or with other words a premature fee market.

Bitmit was a centralized bitcoin-only marketplace that shut down a few years ago. I think they got popular by word of mouth. There's a large need for a market place like Ebay because today we simply don't have any whether it's centralized or decentralized. All we have are darknet markets but then there's the extra step of having to use Tor before you can access them which makes many people not even bother. 
Bitmit showed that there is a need and Open Bazaar will be the only player who will attempt to fill that need. I think word of mouth will show to be sufficient yet again, simply because of a lack of competition and a built-up large demand ever since Bitmit closed.

Thanks for teaching me the word "agorist" today.
For the lazy:
Most agorists consider themselves market anarchists, while some proponents characterize it as a form of left-libertarianism.[3][3] 
Agorists generally oppose voting for political candidates and political reform. Instead, agorists stress the importance of alternative strategies rather than politics to achieve a free society. Agorists claim that we can achieve a free society more easily and sooner by employing such alternative methods.[citation needed] 
Such alternative strategies consist of education, direct action, entrepreneurship, and counter-economics.[citation needed] Agorists advocate promoting awareness of libertarianism and Austrian economics.[citation needed]"
and for the critical:
Agorists' opposition to voting differs from the views of Murray Rothbard, who defended the act of voting.[4] Rothbard openly denounced Konkin's agorism, claiming:
"Konkin’s entire theory speaks only to the interests and concerns of the marginal classes who are self-employed. The great bulk of the people are full-time wage workers; they are people with steady jobs. Konkinism has nothing whatsoever to say to these people. To adopt Konkin’s strategy, then, would on this ground alone, serve up a dead end for the libertarian movement. We cannot win if there is no possibility of speaking to the concerns of the great bulk of wage earners in this and other countries."[5]'

Almost every miner is using Bitcoin Core for mining today. Why would it take all the way until July 2017 to activate the fork for blocks with a limit of 2 MB, if the Bitcoin Core client will be voting for a limit increase hard fork as soon as July 2016?  
Does this mean that the Bitcoin Core client will have a setting where miners can choose to mine blocks with a 1 MB or 2 MB limit? What percentage of mined blocks will be needed to activate the fork? 750/1000 or maybe 950/1000?

Here is a rebuttal in regard to the severity of the bug that Gregory found:
As you can see, the effects of this bug are negligible and corrects itself automatically when it happens once every 200 blocks, at the cost of decreasing efficiency by 1 percentage point (15 % speed consumption becomes 16 % speed consumption instead, so no big deal even if left unfixed which it won't be.).
It's like you have a car that has a top speed of 200 km / h but there is a bug which makes the top speed to reduce to 198 km / h every once in a while. It's a small reduction in top speed and it happens rarely. Its reduction happens for 10 minutes once every 200 km. While technically a problem yes, I'd say the severity of the problem is annoying at most and negligible at best.

But whatever, anyone who wishes is welcome to participate in the Bitcoin ecosystem so I don't really care, I just found it a bit interesting and surprising that's all.

IANAL. So why hasn't Fincen forced Wladimir van der Laan to implement AML into the Bitcoin Core source code then? He's the Bitcoin Core source code maintainer and project leader who can add and remove repository commiters. They could easily fine Wladimir if he would refuse to comply with Fincen's direct orders. Just because Wladimir says that he isn't the Benevolent Dictator of the Bitcoin Core project, doesn't make him any less so.
Wladimir has complete power over that project because he has the login and password to the github repository admin account. Or is that still Gavin Andresen? If it's Gavin Andresen then Fincen would easily be able to say: "Hey Gavin, do as we tell you to do or we will fine you a large fine."
What is the difference between the Benevolent Dictator Wladimir for the Bitcoin Core project and the Benevolent Dictator (whoever that is - who is it? With the login and password to the github admin account?) for the Bitcoin Classic project? Fincen can force those two people just as easily. It's not more difficult to force Wladimir to do something than it is to force the admin guy for Bitcoin Classic to do something.
My interpretation therefore is that Fincen actively chooses not to issue such orders to either project leader. And a Bitcoin Classic token miner is doing the exact same thing as a Bitcoin Core token miner. So why would Fincen treat those two miners any differently in regard to MSB (AML, KYC or whatever) regulation. That just wouldn't make any sense.

I double checked your math. Yes, there is about 5 billion ounces of gold above ground according to Wikipedia's article on "gold". And yes, that would translate to about 238 ounces of gold for every whole bitcoin. However, I didn't get the same result when calculating how much 1000 people would have to buy newly mined bitcoins for, so that a price of 10 usd / btc would remain stable. According to this calculation it would only be needed about 2.2k usd / month of new capital:
50\*6\*24\*30.5\*10 = 2.196\*10^6
where 50 is the amount of bitcoins mined per new block, 6 is the amount of blocks per hour, 24 is the amount of hours per day, 30.5 is the average number of days per month, and 10 is the price per bitcoin in usd.
Dividing 2.196\*10^6 with 1000 people gives you 2.196\*10^3 new usd per month per person. That is, it's closer to 2k usd / month than what you suggested, 5k usd / month.
I thought that since I did the double checking for myself I might as well share it with others. I don't like sports, so I'll ignore your statement about Olympic medals.

No worries. I didn't speculate more money than I could afford to loose. Sometimes early adopters get rewarded, and sometimes not. On the positive side, it's been more than half a year since the value started going down from 32 usd / btc, and the software and system is still being actively developed. The market cap is at ~40 million usd, so there is still a good probability that the project won't die.
Even if I wouldn't make money off of it for being an early adopter (or more correctly, an early speculator), it's still going to become a useful payment system for me in the future, unless a more successful system replaces it.
To me this technology feels like it's going to do to payment systems and store of value systems, like email did to paper letters. I write "feels" because I'm not sure that I'm right. I just feel convinced that I am. As convinced as I felt that Google Wave would take off and replace email. Don't worry if you never heard of Google Wave. Just ignore me.

No, once 75 % of all Bitcoin nodes have voted for 2 MB blocks, then all clients who accept 2 MB blocks will be Bitcoin clients, and all clients that keep the deprecated and obsolete 1 MB rule will be altcoin clients who are no longer connected to the Bitcoin network. The economic majority decides what is and what is not Bitcoin. That decision is not made by the Bitcoin Core project alone.

Thanks for your explanation. But I got misunderstood. IIRC, some people on Reddit use brackets to indicate how high they are, on a scale from 1-10. So [0] would mean totally sober and [10] would mean as high as an influenced person can be.  
My attempt at humor was that since you thought OP:s joke was very funny (and drugged people think things are funny that sober people think are just ordinary) and several other people downvoted you, you must obviously be high. My question to you was therefore "How high are you right now?". That's what I meant with the question mark inside the brackets.  
Obviously far fetched in retrospect, but nonetheless at least a little bit funny to at least myself :). [0].

You seem to assume that it is a rare occurrence that an attacker would know the public key. But isn't every receiving address a public key? If it is, then no one would be able to publicly post a receiving address, greatly diminishing the usefulness of Bitcoin.
Oh, it seems the next post explained why I was wrong. It seems that a receiving address is a hash of the public key, and not the public key itself. The post I'm referring to:
"Bitcoin addresses are hashes of the public key, so even if you break ECDSA you still could not steal coins from unspent addresses.
However, once you spend the coins from an address the public key is out and that address would be vulnerable to an ECDSA breaking quantum computer."

The way the attacker could get root on any linode of his choice was by resetting the root password through Linode's web management interface. In order to do that, the attacker also had to reboot the linode vps before the password got changed. That would be very noticeable to the real user because it would show up in the "Host Job Queue" of the management interface. There is no way to delete that list of things that have happened, and my two linodes didn't get rebooted, hence they have not been logged into by this attacker. 
I haven't been using my linodes to anything bitcoin related and most of Linode's customers also haven't been using theirs for that purpose. I expect only those 8 linodes got rebooted and "sniffed through" as you describe it. The attacker knew beforehand which machines to target, and attacked only those. At least that is what I believe because my linodes were not rebooted.

I don't think people will buy bitcoin when times are uncertain. Bitcoin today is a very speculative investment, so much so that I don't even call it an investment. I call it a speculation. I don't know how you reason during times of uncertainty, but I very surely am not going to start speculating. If anything, I'd sell my bitcoin cutting any losses and buying gold. I think most people holding both today and in the foreseeable future would reason like that.
If bitcoin were already an established and widely used currency with almost everyone accepting it as payment, I'd probably risk half in bitcoin and half in gold during times of strong global economic crises. But bitcoin is very far from there yet. And the reason I'd *still* hold at least half in gold would be because there would be no guarantees that internet would come back in a reasonable time with a reasonable functionality, in which case everyone would prefer gold, I think.

Even if bitcoin were only legal to use in China, it would still be valuable to own bitcoin.
I bought a few rubber shells and screen protector plastic films for my phones, a week ago from Chinese sellers via Ebay, for example. It was a lot cheaper than buying from Swedish companies (I live in Sweden). If bitcoin would take off in China and it would remain legal there, I could have bought those and such products from the Chinese sellers directly with bitcoin instead of going through Ebay first.

I think banks' adoption of bitcoin may be as inevitable as banks' adoption of the internet. In 1995 very few people thought that banks would ever allow their customers to use the banks' services through the internet.
But it was such a more advantageous way of doing business that eventually even the big banks started using the internet and started closing bank offices that were no longer as much needed.
It feels like the same could happen with bitcoin. They may adopt it because of all the advantages. I mean they do use gold (gold reserves) and don't try to make gold transactions illegal. And gold shares many relevant characteristics with bitcoin.
It's going to be interesting to follow this change in society and see what happens.

But shortly thereafter, Ron Paul disagrees with Bernanke because what's the point of allowing silver coins as "money" if you get taxed for buying them and then later get taxed again if you sell them at a profit? Ron Paul said in the video that he doesn't consider silver coins as money if the rules are in that way.
Let's compare that to the usd: If you buy 1000 usd with euro for example, you won't have to pay a tax for doing so. Let's say the usd deflates so that your 1000 usd suddenly get you the purchasing power of 1200 usd. You wouldn't have to pay taxes for that 200 usd increase in value.
If you make it legal to use silver coins, but tax them, you are not treating them as if they were money anymore. So I'd have to disagree with you. As long as silver coins and bitcoins aren't treated the same way in regards to taxation as usd, Bernanke has not okeyd the use of bitcoin. Neither of them even mentioned bitcoin in the video. They talked about usd and silver coins.

If I were the kind of thief you're asking about, I think I'd empty every wallet no matter how little was in it. I would do that immediately and then look for the next victim. I think that behavior would give me the highest payoff per hour of hacking. I'd also revisit every victims computer regularly to see if there were any new wallet there that I could steal again.
That is if I didn't know much about my victims. If I knew that a particular victim is very likely to quite soon fill his wallet with a lot of bitcoins, I'd wait if he had &lt; 1000 usd worth of bitcoin in it, before emptying it. That sum also depends on what country I live in. If I live in a poor country, that sum would be significantly less. It's better to have one bird in your hand than ten in the forest.
**So don't count on hackers leaving your hacked computer alone just because you have what you feel is a small amount of bitcoin in its wallet.**
**Also don't count on the opposite: Assuming that no hacker has control over your computer and / or wallet just because you've had your wallet with a mediocre amount of bitcoins in it, left alone for &gt; a month.**
Not all hackers are the same, and some hack only one victim at a time manually, while others hack many at once automatically. They don't (necessarily) behave exactly the same when they manage to hack a specific computer.
You could update your post with how *you* would behave if you managed to hack one or several wallets.

Don't say never. For every new oil source humanity finds today, more than one is depleted. Eventually we'll run out of oil, and when that happens there just isn't enough uranium to satisfy the energy demand created by the lack of oil. By then, any energy source will be vital to exploit. If for no other reason than to power food production machinery and food transportation vehicles, from low population density areas to high population density areas.
What worries me is that I've heard there is not enough [rare earth metals]( needed to replace all the world's oil engines with electricity engines. So even if we as a species would find a way to exploit thorium efficiently as an energy source, large parts of humanity would starve anyway when we run out of oil. And since I live in a city and not on farmland, I'll be one of the first ones to starve ;).
My hope is that humanity finds good replacements for oil before that happens. Or find a way to build vehicle motors in a different way so that they wont need so much rare earth metals. \*keeps fingers crossed\*.

Cool idea. Do you or anyone know how the user is intended to take backups of the private keys in case the phone is lost or stolen or if the thin sim card breaks? How about hardware attacks on one of these thin sim cards if it's stolen, to extract it's private keys? Is this solution intended to only hold a smaller hot wallet?

Languages are tricky things even to native speakers. I struggle every day with how to express myself as comprehensively as possible in every language I attempt to communicate in. It's not reasonable to demand perfect language from a person just because they're a native speaker. 
Language is a skill like any other skill, and different people simply have different skills. It would be a dull world if everyone would choose to focus on improving the exact same skills. 
I chose to spend a large percentage of my time to improve my language skills and can write and read fairly well. But I had to sacrifice learning how to sing for example. Imagine if everyone would've chosen the exact same priorities as I; there would be no music in this world.

While owning and storing your bitcoin personally has its benefits and advantages, there are also advantages to buy ETN-shares of bitcoin (certificates) instead.
1. It's easier. You buy and sell it the same way you buy and sell any other stock or fund. You just click a few buttons from your stock account that you already have and are familiar with. You don't have to scan and upload a picture of your ID and latest electricity bill like you do on bitcoin exchanges.  
2. Your taxes (at least here in Sweden and probably in many other countries as well, other than the USA) gets calculated and reported automatically for all of your bitcoin profits and losses from all of your trades that you've made.  
3. You don't have to learn about storing your bitcoin securely because you trust a third party to store them safely from hackers on your behalf.  
4. You don't have to risk getting your fiat bank account (albeit temporarily) frozen because your bank suddenly decides that they don't want to allow transactions that are in any way related to a bitcoin exchange. They are probably going to keep allowing fiat transfers to and from your stock account provider even though you've traded a bitcoin ETN / ETF and they normally don't allow bitcoin related transactions.
It's convenient, fast and easy. But as always there is risk involved and you do put an additional risk in trusting a third party compared to storing and managing your bitcoin yourself. Now you can choose what way you want to store and manage your bitcoin, and I think choice is good. For people who don't have computer security as their hobby, choosing an ETN or ETF may be a preferable choice.

I thought so as well, until you suggested it was a misinterpretation. Then I read some of your suggested forum thread to see what you meant and found this quote which I understood:
"If you have a mining power of 100 mhash/s and just open 2 miners you would end up mining BTC and NMC at 50 mhash/s each. With the merged mining approach you would mine each at 100 mhash/s. Basically you are computing 1 hash and then submitting that hash to both block chains to see if it's under the target in either one."
Now I see the significance of this combined mining software. Cool cool.

If I remember it correctly, you had to specify your Mtgox account number as part of the comment when you sent fiat money to the exchange so Mtgox would know who sent that money to them.

I've found this way of putting a value to my time useful as well. I think like this:
"How much cash do I get in my hand after one month of employed work?"  
Let's assume the number is 2 000 USD per month.  
"So, if I want to have the same amount of money but take a whole month off for an extra vacation, it will cost me 2 000 USD to do that."  
"That means, if I take one extra day of vacation, it will cost me 2 000 / 30.5 = 66 USD."  
"This means, that whenever I can avoid paying 66 USD, I get one extra day of vacation."  
This line of reasoning has simplified the way I value money. It's led me to value money more, in the sense that it can buy me free time which is the thing I actually value. So if I see a new computer part I'd like to buy that costs 660 USD, I can see the price as representing 10 extra vacation days. That way, I usually avoid buying the computer part. Before I used to think this way, I usually bought the computer part because I couldn't "feel" how much money that actually was.

A few decades into the future, we will be the old guy explaining to the future generation of people how we used actual plastic cards every time we wanted to transact some of our money. Much like how this old guy today explains how they used to have punched cards made out of hard pieces of paper just to be able to input information into a computer in the early 1970's (because as I understand it, the computer-connected keyboard and monitor hadn't been invented yet.):
Story time:
My (quite old, but not yet retired) physics teacher that I had in the year 2010 told me that he has actually used these kinds of paper punched cards as a part of his job a long time ago. 
We started talking about "the old times" one time when I brought my laser-guided (just to guide aiming) temperature measuring gun-like device (that could measure temperatures from a distance without touching the measured object) to one of our physics experimentation classes. I had read in the lesson plan ahead of time that we would be experimenting with how much electricity would cause how much light and heat in an ordinary light bulb, so I thought now would be a good time to bring my temperature measuring device just to be able to verify our theoretical temperature calculations. There was no mention about trying to actually measure the temperature inside the light bulb in the lesson plan, just trying to calculate it with the help from other measured data.
His jaw dropped when he saw me use my temperature measuring device (we were not supposed to use them, and the school didn't have any of their own. We were only supposed to measure the amount of light and electricity and then learn about the temperature from calculating it, not by measuring it.). When I saw his shocked facial expression I immediately thought "Oh, shit, now he's probably thinking that I'm trying to cheat by not doing my calculations". But he just asked me discreetly "how could you afford to buy such a device?". I said that they are sold for about 100 USD in a local electronics shop. 
He said "Wow, just a few decades ago they cost thousands of dollars and were much heavier and larger and were certainly not sold in ordinary hardware shops. May I play with it?". "Of course", I said. "It can measure temperature with an accuracy of 0.1 degrees Celsius.". Then as he played with it we started talking about how he used to type out paper punched cards on a mechanical typewriter when he had one of his earlier jobs a few decades ago. So a few decades into the future, we may tell the future generation how we used to put a plastic card into a machine just to be able to buy groceries, and that we used to call that "swiping the card through the reader".

Regarding point 4:


You say that in the beginning of Bitcoin, "nearly all the currency ended up with only a handful of people.". That is not true, because more than half of the bitcoin currency is still not mined.
You say that "These people have since vanished and cashed out [..]". How do you know this? You don't know this. This is not possible to know.
Regarding point 5:


I would be more likely to believe your claim, if you named that "main developer" and provided a link to his statement. What do you even mean by that statement? BoA will never run my bitcoin node. I think most nodes will be run by ordinary users like you and me. They won't be run by banks (or whatever you may have meant by stating that).
It seems to me that SolidCoin is just another bitcoin fork, made by one / a few people in an attempt to earn as much money possible from people who want to earn a little from short term speculation. There is no innovation here, nor any real benefits, except for their claim to solve the problem of slow block generation if bitcoin would ever experience a sudden and big drop in miner interest. If this would turn out to be a real problem, then the bitcoin official client could be patched to solve it. There is no real need to fork bitcoin just for this feature.

I will loose those bitcoins (because the hash that they were sent to doesn't really represent a known bitcoin address' private key), but at the same time the hash of my text file will be forever stored in the blockchain, accessible through for example blockexplorer.com? Then I could in effect use the bitcoin system to timestamp my text documents for a very small bitcoin cost per timestamp, correct? Cool and useful if true.

There is an uncorrected math problem in the paper that you recommended, according to this quote from a blog comment beneath the paper[1]:












The blog article author seems to agree with the anonymous poster in this comment:








I recommend reading the conversation between the redditor who found the math problem and the paper author, that is linked to by the author in the above quote.  
I especially recommend this conversation thread about the consequences for voting that the chosen BIP101 activation method has, as well as has not:
**The conclusion** should imho be, that **the BIP101 should more properly be advertised as having a practical activation trigger of 69 % instead of the theoretical 75 % miner yes votes.  
A 69 % portion of yes voters would unintentionally activate the BIP101 after several years has passed.  
A 68 % portion of yes voters would unintentionally activate the BIP101 after several years *times ten* has passed.**  
So one percent fewer voters affects years to instead become decades. Therefore, it is in my opinion reasonable to treat the activation threshold as 69 % for all intents and purposes, because treating it as 68 % or lower would take several decades before there could be an unintentional triggering. 
The BIP101 specification should keep specifying the threshold as being 75 % though, because that is technically and mathematically correct. But in regular conversation it may be preferable to advertise the BIP101 as having a theoretical 75 % threshold and a 69 % practical threshold, so non-statisticians won't get any unintentional surprises, if it turns out that the BIP101 activates somewhere between 69-75 % instead of exactly at 75 %.
When thinking of the BIP101 trigger of 75 %, you should think of it being 69 % instead, and in doing so, you will be safe and be extremely unlikely to be surprised by an unintentional and premature triggering.

It's not a baseless claim:


That means that the inflation rate constantly decreases. It's a part of the bitcoin protocol, and every node that does not follow this protocol will be ignored by the majority of the nodes. So there are no ways to create more bitcoins than the protocol allows unless the majority of the users agree to change the protocol. If the bitcoin client developers would change the next version of the software to change this rule of the protocol, people would simply not upgrade to the latest version, and instead "upgrade" to a forked version of the client. So in all practicality, there will never be more than 21 million bitcoins in circulation.

Even though Microsoft themselves accept bitcoin as payment for some of their products in some regions, they could very well give you a similar error message should they ever create a similar service as Google Wallet. It would all depend upon which bank Microsoft would choose to cooperate with and what restrictions that bank would demand.
Either that, or maybe Microsoft too may disallow the "cash advance" type of transaction that Circle has chosen to be using.
Or both.
Hopefully this will all change as bitcoin gains mainstream adoption over time. I wouldn't move from the well used Android platform to the barren Windows Mobile just over this. Even Apple started to allow bitcoin apps on their app store just 6 months after they first instinctively disallowed it. Things can change quickly in the bitcoin ecosystem.

Interesting. Maybe bitcoin is extra appealing to individuals who have recently seen their state's currency collapse. Maybe bitcoin can get local adoption in a smaller region like that, first, and then spread from there? If a local community agrees on using bitcoin, it can work as a practical example that it actually works. 
According to the Facebook movie, they started Facebook in one particular university. No one else were allowed to join. That way everyone knew everyone else and had a desire to be a user of the system because "everyone" else was. When they got acceptance from one university, they accepted students from one more university. And so on, until they started allowing users that didn't even have a .edu address. Maybe there would be a similar advantage for Bitcoin to do the same? Start locally and expand from there?

Just because merged mining is driving the namecoin price down, doesn't mean it's killing namecoin. It just means that the coins are distributed faster. Hopefully they are being bought by many people and not just a few, so that the namecoins get distributed widely and not concentrated to a just a few people. 
Money is no good (as money) if only one person owns all the currency - who's he going to trade with? 
It's like with the Federal Reserve and money creators like them - soon they will own so much of their own currency that everyone besides them, will no longer be able to afford to pay their loans' interests, which will make the currency unuseful.

Maybe Sheldon first buys a lot of computers to mine for bitcoins.
Then he uses his bitcoins to buy black market uranium with which he can build his personal nuclear reactor.
Then he uses his nuclear reactor to supply power to his computers.
Then he gets megalomaniac and insults Howard for being just a lowly engineer and not a proper PhD.
Then his nuclear powersupply starts having a meltdown.
Then Howard demands an apology and 90 % of Sheldons bitcoins in return for using his "lowly engineering skills" to quickly avoid a meltdown.
Somehow the FBI gets a hold of all of this and arrests everyone.
They later get released because Howard's lawyer cousin successfully argues that Sheldon managed to buy 70 % of all black market uranium, thereby making it unavailable to real terrorists.
Sheldon pays the lawyer costs from the money he gets from selling all of his expensive computers.
Penny installed this cute computer game on Sheldon's computer while they were all in jail, unknowingly installing a malware program that a hacker then used to copy Sheldon's bitcoin wallet file, spending all of Sheldon's bitcoins on porn and poker sites. The hacker left a message: "So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish".

Yes. But for the price of 1 usd/btc. That way I'd make a good profit, and the currency could have another chance of taking off. Sometimes ideas are good but before their time. That makes it worth trying the same idea more than once but at a later time when the society has changed. 
Imagine starting Google's search engine business when the internet consisted of only about 1000 sites. Not many people would've been using it, therefore diminishing Google's ad revenues to such a degree, they would've had to fire one of their three employees because their revenues wouldn't have been enough to afford paying his salary. Google's stock wouldn't have been worth much in those times.
Bitcoin may be the same. Maybe the timing is wrong but that the idea will eventually be adopted as society changes over time. So I'd sell them to anyone for 1 usd/btc if I owned all 21 million of them. Unless of course someone would offer me more for them. More is more.
Edit1: Grammar.
tl;dr: Yes but for 1 usd/btc because they would still have a potential future value for various reasons, mainly because of "wrong timing" for getting our society to adopt bitcoin.

I'm under the impression that most people who use bitcoin today trust their own knowledge about computer security more than they trust anyone else to do it for them. You take a risk either way. If you host your wallet.dat file containing your bitcoins on your own computer, you risk that a cracker steals it from you because they find a way to crack your security. If you host your bitcoins on Mt. Gox, Tradehill, or some other online service that can do that for you, then you take a risk of someone cracking them.
An attacker would have to choose to spend less time trying to hack you and if successful steal relatively few coins, or spend a lot of time trying to hack centralized coin storages such as Mt. Gox for example. But then they could steal a lot of coins at once.
I don't think it's possible to, with a reasonable certainty, be giving advice to people you don't know in a case like this. It's got to be up to the individual bitcoin user to choose whom at what to trust. When in doubt a tip could be to spread the risk and not invest more than you could comfortably afford to loose, should shit hit the fan. Don't keep 100 % of your bitcoins in just one place, whatever that place may be. I think you get the idea. Good luck, I guess we all need it ;).

The user "gonzobon" wrote that the reason he stays subscribed to despite the censorship from the moderators, is that there is so much valuable and on topic bitcoin related posts in this subreddit. 
You however seem to have interpreted it as if the user "gonzobon" thinks it's a bad thing that the subreddit has a lot of valuable and on topic bitcoin related posts. It seems that the people who downvoted your question did so simply because they consider your interpretation to be incorrect. Don't worry about the downvotes you got for your question. People misinterpret each other all the time. 
It's a difficult thing to transfer a thought from one human brain to another without at least a small part of that thought to be interpreted in an unintended way. Just read something you wrote ten years ago and you'll see how today you'll find how "yes I can see how this could, legitimately and perfectly reasonably, be interpreted in a way that does not represent the thought I was actually thinking, accurately at all". 
Or try to understand the notes you took from a class you had in school, just one week later. 
At the time you were writing it, it seemed clear and completely impossible to misinterpret, right? But just one week later not even you yourself can comprehend what it was that you, again yourself, were trying to say with the notes that you wrote down. Language is a much more difficult thing to do correctly than most people realize. That's why chick's dig poets. Heck, even I as a straight guy enjoyed Robin Williams' linguistic eloquence in his movie "Dead poets society". (A very good movie even if you don't like poetry.) 
The reason you got many instead of few downvotes is because you expressed your opinion about a topic that is considered very important to the future of the entire bitcoin project, and there are a lot of strong feelings on both sides. I neither up nor down voted your question because I interpreted your question as simply a consequence of you misunderstanding the comment you were replying to. I didn't interpret your question as neither pro nor con the XT fork / BIP101, but I guess some of the downvoters interpreted your question and comment to have been con XT / BIP101.

There would be nothing wrong with storing a hash of their data. But they get timestamping that cannot (realistically) be altered by anyone, if they choose to store their hashes on the bitcoin blockchain. That's a very big advantage if you want to use your hashes as proof that any of their data actually existed at a specific point in time. 
If they would have only stored the hashes but not timestamped them in any unchangeable way, then they wouldn't have been able to use those hashes as proof that the data in question really existed at that specific point in time. The bitcoin blockchain is simply a very secure way of timestamping for them, and the Factom company provides a good and user friendly user interface for the hospital to manage their hashes and timestamps. 
Edit1: The healthcare industry uses journals extensively in their business, and it's important to them that no one can alter those historical records after they have been logged. Even if a hacker, malicious doctor or nurse would somehow manage to alter a historical journal entry for one of their patients, there would always be a hash of the historical data timestamped and stored on the blockchain in such a way that it would be possible to mathematically prove that the old data is correct and that the new data is the manipulated version. 
All anyone would have to do to prove the authenticity of a journal entry would be to have a backup of it stored somewhere anywhere. If there is ever a dispute as to which data is the real data, then only the real data would hash in the exact same way as the hash that is already timestamped and stored on the blockchain. 
Money is just one application that can be run on the bitcoin technology. Timestamping medical journal entries in a provable way is another one.

What did they do to make more and more people use credit cards instead of cash? Can we do the same to make people use btc and btc terminals instead of credit cards?

Read below if no one answers you.
To get a very rough approximation, you could try to find that leaked password list from a while ago and count the number of accounts. If you're on the list and remember when you registered, you can compare your user number with the latest. Then you'll know how long time it took to reach that number of users. This approximation if of course very inaccurate but could be better than nothing.

Does each new "find the hash"-challenge somehow depend on the hash that was previously found, or can one precalculate a small number of hashes that one can "release" one after another very fast? The reason I'm thinking precalculating should work is because if it didn't work, then what would've been to point of that "proof of date" message in the genesis block?
And if it is possible to precalculate two future hashes and not release them until one makes a big transaction, one could release both those new blocks very fast after one another, thereby canceling that big transaction. Am I correct?

I sent them an email and asked them a few questions.
1. What happens to the 25 USD if I want to stop using your service, or if Uber decides to cancel your business account?  
**Answer:** "You can always request all the money remaining in your account back at any time, and it'll be paid instantly via bitcoin!"
2. I assume your service works anywhere that Uber already works? I'd like to use it in Sweden.  
**Answer:** "It works everywhere Uber works, even Sweden!"
3. Will my account hold bitcoin, or will it hold USD? I'd prefer you to hold my funds in the form of bitcoin, if possible.  
**Answer:** "It's held in USD.. but you can always just send the BTC in right as you're about to ride, we accept it with zero confirmations, so that way you can keep it as BTC as long as you're not about to use it!"

I had numerous acquaintances that, at the time, hadn't bought their first computer yet "because they don't need one", who smiled and said "I told you so." and "See? The internet was just something popular and now it's not. It will never become mainstream, which has has become obvoius now.".
Fast forward ten years and everyone has Facebook, "google" and use internet banking. If you ask them about their earlier predictions, they just shrug it off as "well, I didn't know what it was back then, and no one did. No biggie.".
I live in Sweden that as a country are considered to be early adopters when it comes to using internet and technology in general. So the false predictions probably happened in a lot of other countries as well.

That's what we think now. I thought the same with Altavista before Google came along. Altavista had much more pages indexed than Google when Google was new and Altavista was the market leader. But even though Google had fewer sites indexed, they still gave me more relevant hits which made me and probably more and more people to abandon Altavista in favor for Google. So IIRC the main reason Google took Altavista's market share was because Google was first with a very significant new technology no one at the time had thought of, and didn't think was important even when they'd heard of it: Google's page ranking system. What I was saying was that given enough time, someone always tends to invent something everone else didn't think of. And when that happens, people (sometimes) change to that superior system. It happened with Altavista vs. Google and didn't happen with VHS vs. SVHS. Very difficult to predict what will happen, me thinks.

"Huge Bitcoin sell off due to a compromised account - rollback
Mark Karpeles
posted this on Jun-20 04:07
The bitcoin will be back to around 17.5$/BTC after we rollback all trades that have happened after the huge Bitcoin sale that happened on June 20th near 3:00am (JST).
Service should be back by June 20th 10:00am (JST, 01:00am GMT) with all the trades reversed and accounts available.
One account with a lot of coins was compromised and whoever stole it (using a HK based IP to login) first sold all the coins in there, to buy those again just after, and then tried to withdraw the coins. The $1000/day withdraw limit was active for this account and the hacker could only get out with $1000 worth of coins.
Apart from this no account was compromised, and nothing was lost. Due to the large impact this had on the Bitcoin market, we will rollback every trade which happened since the big sale, and ensure this account is secure before opening access again."

How does he verify my proof of work for each block I send him that didn't find the target hash? Doesn't he need to also do the same hashing to see whether he gets the same hash or not? It seems like a lot of data is sent to the pool operator if I have to send proof of work for lets say 500 Mhash/s. Because the operator isn't only interested in the block that I actually find, but also all of the blocks I checked that didn't find the bitcoins. How does one verify that I really did the hashing, without having to do the same hashing oneself? I'm sorry if your previous answer contained the answer to this question and I asked again, but all this feels quite complex for me and my level of knowledge in this area.
Edit 1:

Sure, but you forgot the consequence of ddosing mining pools; that miners will get less coins to sell on Mt. Gox while the ddoser is selling his coins. That should make the ddosers coins slightly more valuable in the short term, making his sell slightly more profitable. So I believe this hypothesis could turn out to be true.

Yeah, they will never reach below at least 0.00001 usd/btc because then I'd buy all 21 million btc for 210 usd just because I'd value them for their collecting value. It'd be like buying a piece of history, if nothing else. Like owning a piece of moon-rock. It's just a rock but it would be cool to have one. I don't think bitcoins will become worthless and unused, unless a competing and similar but superior technology takes over. Like Bittorrent did with Direct Connect, for example. Or Google did with Altavista. If, however, a superior technology doesn't come soon, we might experience a situation similar to the VHS vs. SVHS standards war, where the inferior (VHS) standard won just because it had greater adoption. So anything might (still) happen, and don't bet more on bitcoin than you could comfortably loose. I bought at 32 usd/btc, hehe.

I'll spread my risk by using Mt. Gox, TH and exchangebitcoins.com equally often. After thinking a bit about who's more likely to be more secure, I've come to the conclusion that they all are equally insecure. At least with my knowledge and from my perspective. The reason that only Mt. Gox of the three exchanges I've mentioned has been hacked so far, could to a large extent be simply because every hacker prefers to hack the exchange with the largest bounty. It's like viruses and Microsoft. Almost all trojan authors write their trojans for MS Windows because it gives them the largest botnet if successful.
It often takes time to hack someone. Mt. Gox has been around for a long time before getting hacked. What if we look at the other two mentioned exchanges two months from now? Then the hackers would've had more time to do their planning/research and finally actual hacking, and would perhaps have hacked the newcomers as well.
Also we now know that Mt. Gox is very unlikely to run away with our money. They handle so much money and have not run away with it. What about the new exchanges that still don't handle so much money? Can they be trusted more than Mt. Gox in this respect?
We know that almost all users still had their money when they logged back in to Mt. Gox. There has been very few complaints of the maybe say ~20k actual traders that they haven't gotten their accounts back / didn't have the correct balance. Whatever stupidity we may attribute Mt. Gox for letting themselves become hacked, our money is there there.
Most of us were interested in computers, cryptography and computer security even before we got interested in the bitcoin system. Most of us probably know that the biggest player almost always get hacked when given enough time. If this wouldn't have been Mt. Gox it would've been someone else.
There is a lot of stupidity on the internet. But when it comes to actual money, even the seemingly stupider people seem to behave quite rationally actually. I suggest that it isn't conclusive that the rational thing to do right now is to abandon Mt. Gox for their current competitors. I suggest that it is to spread your risk. Don't keep all your money in the same wallet.
That said, I too expected that more people would move to another exchange and that the trading volume would decrease in the short term until trust would rebuild. So considering that I was wrong about that, I wouldn't recommend to treat any of the above speculation as some kind of logical truth or something ;).

This is like the first businesses that opened up close to the gold diggers during the gold rush. If I would've been a very early adopter with a lot of btc, I would consider doing some shopping even if the prices where somewhat higher, just because I got the coins relatively easy and its just a few clicks to get physical stuff sent home to me. I think this service has the potential to become a hit. It's also good to be able to link btc to physical goods - it gives btc "real" value.

Interesting hypothesis. I for one would not deal in neither drugs, hookers, porn nor poker, even if the bitcoin system would enable me to do so with a 100 % certainty of not getting caught. As long as I don't have to work more than 40 hours a week just to afford food and a place to live, I won't deal in these things. Porn should be free as all kinds of software/movies/music. Drugs should be legal, so I don't have a moral problem to deal with it and profit from the dealings. But I do have a moral problem with earning a significant profit from it. I don't enjoy the idea of making money on other peoples misery. 
Being addicted to drugs and then have to pay someone like me through your nose is misery. The nation states should sell drugs at self cost so that we minimize crime that drug addicts commit just to afford their expensive problem. Drugs would be very cheap if they would not be illegal, patented and whatever.
Hookers should be their own pimps and the majority of their earnings should go to them personally. Just like authors should get the majority of the profit from their book sales, and not their distributors. The reason I think it's ok for women to be able to charge for sex is because even I (I'm a mediocre looking male) would sell sex if given enormous amounts of money. Even to significantly uglier women. But at the same time I'd of course appreciate that the state would take care of me if I'd feel like prostitution were my only option. If social welfare would provide housing and food and tobacco/alcohol/drugs/healthcare were sold at cost, all the prostitutes who would feel forced to work in prostitution would be able to stop. Then only people like me would sell their bodies for sex ;).
Creating and profiting from a poker site would feel like stealing from the mathematically challenged and would be no better than stealing candy from a retard. If I could live a sufficiently comfortable life (I could even go down in bandwidth, and not afford candy and all the tv channels) I'd still not steal from my mathematically challenged brothers and sisters.
So in my case, I wouldn't say that I'm exceedingly comparable to Gordon Gecko (from the Wallstreet movie to those that don't get the reference) just because I speculate and use the bitcoin currency. The discovery of nuclear fission could be used both for atom bombs and for nuclear power reactors. There must be another, better, way to solve crime than to ban bitcoin.
tl;dr: Speculating and using bitcoin doesn't necessarily make you deal and profit from neither drugs, hookers, porn nor poker. There must be better ways to stop crime than to ban bitcoin. Some crimes should not be crimes.
EDIT: I'd bet that all money of all types of currencies has at some point in time been used by criminals. We should not attack money. We should attack the criminals. Unless they are file sharers of course.

You are correct in all of your assumptions. The point is to be able to prove that a certain copy of a medical journal entry actually did exist at a specific point in time. It would be assumed that if the court would be presented with two versions of the same data, one version from before the dispute and one version from after the dispute started, then the older data is the authentic data. The age of the data would be mathematically provable by comparing the hashes of both pieces of data with the hash stored on the blockchain, and only the true hash would be identical when compared.

tl;dr: At first mining was good. Then everyone started mining. Now there is too much competition for anyone contemplating becoming a new miner.
Liquidity is low (that means it's a bit cumbersome to convert btc into usd and vice versa) and there are a lot of early adopters that have many btc. There are not many people offering services that one can pay with btc directly. Become a service provider, and you can have high btc prices because the early adopters have a lot of btc. Then sell these btc on Mt. Gox and make a good profit. This will work until everyone starts doing it.
When everyone accepts btc as payment, no large profits will be possible to make, and bitcoin will have become an established currency that will not go away.

1) As I'm reading your comments, you're frequently arguing for a smaller block size cap than the caps described in BIP101. 
2) Until recently I believe that you were on the moderators' side in regard to censoring redditors who advocated that the bitcoin community should start using Bitcoin XT instead of Bitcoin Core. That has maybe changed recently so that you would want the moderators to stop censoring and let the community upvote and downvote comments and posts instead. I may remember your stance on censorhip incorrectly though. I noticed that you avoid calling it "censorship" and prefer to call it by a more positive name: "aggressive moderation". 
I did use RES a few times to tag users so that I could remember their opinions, but RES kept resetting itself for me about once every 6 months, so I stopped tagging people.
3) You think that opt-in Full RBF is a good thing to have been implemented into Bitcoin Core.
4) You believe that Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen are bad for Bitcoin and that Blockstream and Peter Todd are good for Bitcoin.
I believe the opposite in all the above cases, which is what makes me "very rarely agree with anything you're writing". I may remember things incorrectly about you because I don't keep notes about people and there are a lot of people to remember things about. My memory is admittedly bad. There is nothing wrong with your intelligence. You're just wrong about many things many times, in my opinion.








Yes, I agree that it would be a catastrophe if Jamie Dimon would be elected to be the project leader of Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin XT for example. He would very likely do everything in his power to destroy Bitcoin because his main income is from a competitor to Bitcoin (the traditional banking system). Jamie doesn't even try to hide his hostility towards Bitcoin. Maybe Mike Hearn's employer is going to corrupt him from the perspective of us Bitcoin users, but I haven't seen any such indications yet. So he's innocent until indicated guilty in my eyes. He only recently got employed by R3 and it takes a little time to see what actually happens with incentives and decisions. 
I actually thought it was a good thing that Blockstream employed two Bitcoin Core committers when I first heard about it because it's always nice to have a steady paycheck. But my opinion regarding whether Blockstream has a conflict of interest or not with the greater good of the Bitcoin ecosystem has changed over time. Proving conflicts of interest is a very difficult thing, and I cannot prove that there is one. But seeing how they so enthusiastically argue to keep the blocksize cap small makes me think that they plan to offer an off-chain proprietary solution to the problem for a fee (that becomes their profit) in the future. If they wouldn't have spent so much effort trying to argue for a small blocksize cap, I probably wouldn't have thought that they had a conflict of interest with the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem.
The way I see it currently is that Mike Hearn simply got tired of not having a steady paycheck and took a job at R3 to implement "blockchain technology" into their existing software and systems. From his post defending himself for why he accepted the job offer, he wrote that he'd be working with helping them use "blockchain technology but without using a token such as bitcoin", if I'm paraphrasing correctly. If that works at all (I don't think it will), it is far from being a competing altcoin to bitcoin in my opinion. If he would work with creating an altcoin for R3, then I would most definitely also think that Mike would have a serious conflict of interest with his role as project leader for Bitcoin XT.
From what I've read and interpreted, it seems as if those banks want to adopt only a few advantages (such as much faster clearing, and just standardization in general) that Bitcoin has, but they don't want to use the value token bitcoin itself. They just don't understand how dependent a blockchain is of a value token such as bitcoin.






The difference between a fact and a belief is often just a perspective. From your perspective your facts seem like facts to you. From my perspective they seem like beliefs, not facts. I'm sure that to a very religious person, they are convinced that it's a fact that God exists. From an atheist's perspective that's just a belief, not a fact. And vice versa regarding the evolution theory. To the atheist evolution is a fact, and to a religious person evolution is just a belief. So who's right then? Only God knows. Just kidding. There is no God.












Yes. I forgot that Gavin was paid as an advisor to Coinbase. I remember now that you reminded me. Including Coinbase in "R3/Coinbase XT" would make sense in this regard.






Thank you for calling me naive! I'm usually called cynical. Naive feels much better. Now throw in a handsome and funny, and you'll make my day.


Yes, time will tell. So far I don't see any change in Mike Hearn's behaviour that would be due to influence from his new employer. It's too early to see any consequences yet, if ever.

We have to be able to refer to the two types of people, so we need names for the groups. How about **"small block cap proponents"** and **"large block cap proponents"**? Doesn't that sound **neutral and non-judging for both types of people**? 
The terms have no actual numbers in them so that as many people as possible who have an opinion in this debate, can have a group they can belong to. The suffix "proponent" is meant to signify that the person has at least a preference regarding max block size, but maybe even is a passionate advocate of that block size.

Thanks, I think I actually understand[1] now. The key that was missing before I could understand the process was that I didn't know about the checking that is being done for blocks with difficulty 1. With that piece of the puzzle it all makes sense.
Do you know if Satoshi envisioned this way of pooling the search for blocks before he released the genesis block, or if later miners invented this method of cooperation? If he thought about this before his first release, I'd say I feel quite impressed by the completeness of his thinking. He really covered both the whole as well as the details. I don't think I'd have thought about the necessity and usefulness to pool mining, when mining would eventually become too risky for solo miners.
And don't worry about being perceived as condescending by explaining things I may already understand / know about. Whatever I already understood, someone else reading our conversation maybe didn't already understand. So there is very rarely any harm done explaining "too much". I thank you for taking the time to explain even though there is a risk only I benefited from reading your explanations (due to there being relatively few upvotes for this Reddit text-submission in the first place).

I own both bitcoin certificates (The "Bitcoin Tracker One" ETN certificate from XBT Provider) and actual bitcoin. The reason I've chosen to own both is to hedge against the risk of me making one of two mistakes:
1. Failing at computer security which results in a hacker steals my cold storage bitcoin somehow.
2. Failing at creating a proper cold storage solution so that it turns out to be impossible to turn my cold wallet into a hot wallet.
I'm just spreading the risk. I don't own solely bitcoin certificates, because the corporation that holds the actual bitcoin on my behalf, may lose them just as well as I may lose them. I'm just keeping my eggs in at least two baskets, so to speak.
Yes, I lost the bitcoin that I stored on Mtgox. But that was an acceptable and conscious risk that I took. It may as well had turned out that Mtgox would still be alive and well, but that I lost my own actual bitcoin in my own cold storage. How would that be possible? Well,
1) A simple and unexpected reason at the time, could've been a loss due to the Bitcoin Core wallet storing only 100 pregenerated addresses. Some people lost a lot of coins simply because they didn't know about this limitation that in effect rendered their cold wallet backup irrecoverable, thus making their bitcoin unaccessible forever for everyone.
2) There has been critical problems with random number generators that in retrospect turned out to be not particularly and sufficiently random (Blockchain.info bug and Android bug for example), causing the bitcoin owner to lose their bitcoin whose private keys were generated by such a defective random number generator.
As you can see, it's perfectly possible to lose your coins even if you are in personal control of every aspect of their storage. In my opinion it therefore makes sense to spread the risk by also outsourcing the storage and security of your coins to third parties such as Mtgox and ETFs / ETNs. Every bitcoin holder is free to make their own risk assessment and act accordingly. With bitcoin, you're not just your own bank, but also your own insurance company.

I very rarely agree with anything you're writing. You did however write that you would like Theymos and his moderators to not delete Peter\_\_R's comment and to not ban Peter\_\_R from this subreddit. That I agree with, and for that reason only, I upvoted your comment that I'm now replying to.
If you truly believe that the R3 company who employs Mike Hearn is having a negative influence on Mike's decisions regarding his Bitcoin XT software, then I would welcome you to from now on refer to the Bitcoin XT client as "R3/XT" or as you put it "R3/Coinbase XT".
I'm assuming that the vast majority of BIP101 / Bitcoin XT / FSS RBF proponents would not mind that you do so. They would not agree with you, but they would not try to force you to stop referring to that software by names such as that. It would in fact even be preferable that you refer to Bitcoin XT as R3/Coinbase XT in your texts, because then it would just add clarity to what it is that you believe. I see no reason to hide your nor anyone else's beliefs.
By the way, do you think that Coinbase is paying a salary or other forms of money to Mike Hearn? That's the first time I've heard someone believe that. I thought that consensus among both small- as well as large-block proponents was that R3 is Mike's current employer. Personally I don't think that Mike being an employee of R3 is affecting his Bitcoin-related incentives and decisions negatively. That's just his day job. During night time, I believe that he's Batman.

And if such actors take control of those unmoved coins, then it's unlikely that they'll dump the coins on the fiat exchanges. So in that case the exchange rate of bitcoin would not be affected. It would just be an indirect way of funding quantum computer research. 
So this would not be a problem for the rest of us Bitcoin users and we should therefore not try to make these coins unspendable. We should simply consider it a bounty for quantum computer research. We could even market that as one of the many benefits to society that Bitcoin gives. It promotes and rewards research.

Because I'm trying to expect the unexpected. It was just luck that I didn't lose coins due to the "100 max pregenerated addresses function" of the Bitcoin Core client software, and just luck that the private keys I generated a long time ago where generated by a sufficiently random random number generator.
It wouldn't have mattered in both those cases had I created multiple cold storage wallets instead of just one. They would all have been affected. But the bitcoin stored with third parties wouldn't have been affected in the same way, because they have more brains and I have just one. 
I make stupid decisions and am wrong in my thinking multiple times per day in all kinds of situations. I do trust myself but I don't trust myself completely. I've locked myself out of my own apartment more than once, and I don't want to lock myself out of my bitcoin. Calling the locksmith is cheap when it's just a physical door, but there are no "bitcoin locksmiths". The only option in that case, is tears.
Also, I do have multiple cold storage wallets. That way I will lose only a portion and not all of my cold storage bitcoin when I use one of the private keys on a compromised computer.


Good luck to us all. Keeping fingers and toes crossed.

Bitcoin has reached the stage of requiring "Bitcoin politicians" because of the political divides in the Bitcoin community. You wouldn't accuse Bernie Sanders of "not doing any actual work" just because he's spending a lot of his time campaigning for President? 
I see people such as Adam Back, Austin Hill, Gregory Maxwell, Gavin Andresen, Jeff Garzik and others as having partially transitioned into the role of a Bitcoin politician. There's nothing wrong with that. Such people are needed too when a system grows to a certain size. 
Austin Hill and Adam Back don't write code either but contribute to the overall project by campaigning their politics. And so does Gavin Andresen. Someone has to be thinking of the big picture and not only focus on the technical details. Gavin is a good candidate for such a someone and he has many supporters me included.

Yeah I saw the BBC video a few hours after I wrote that comment. Gavin has been surprisingly naive in how he let the scammer Craig Wright fool him. 
Bitcoin is a system that is built around theories of how trust between people can and can not function. Personally I still think that Gavin is very good at understanding how trust and distrust works within the Bitcoin context. He has demonstrated that ability many many times and Bitcoin has prospered under his leadership and design ideas. 
But I expect a lot of people won't see this difference in skill set and just assume that if he can't understand why not to trust a basic scammer such as Craig, then he probably doesn't understand how to build trust-systems such as Bitcoin. Despite Gavin having demonstrated for 6 solid years that he is actually excellent at understanding how trust works *within the Bitcoin system*. 
But I'm afraid many people won't be able to see and make that distinction, or they'll even pretend to not see it because not seeing it is beneficial to their political agenda. 
At the same time there are even more people who would benefit politically and economically if Gavin becomes very influential in Bitcoin system design, so those people will tend to see and understand this distinction in skill set. Luckily for Gavin, there are more of those people so I'll still bet my money on Gavin and his leadership and ideas. No person can be perfect and Gavin is still by far the most ideal candidate for leadership and Bitcoin system design in my opinion.

The BTM on Malmskillnadsgatan 32 (in central Stockholm) worked flawlessly! It took a minute or two for the machine to send the texts (sms) it needed to my cellphone, and the camera is placed a little too low so one has to crouch down a little so the face becomes visible on the picture. But aside from that it worked perfectly! The touchscreen was impressively exact fast and responsive so it went very fast to enter ones cellphone number. The bill detector device was a little slow and there was a tiny gap on the top of the device's hole that caused one of my bills to go into the machine, but then get bent and come out again through the receipt device's hole.
That only happened once for me, and was easily fixed by simply putting the bill in again at a slightly different angle. There didn't seem to be any risk for the bill to get stuck due to this tiny gap.
I bought my bitcoin and the fee seemed to be correct (I assumed that the SEK/USD rate hadn't changed much in the last hour since last I checked it, and I verified the fee to be approximately 5 %). But I didn't think about that the daily limit was 3000 SEK for *both* buying and selling, and not just for buying. So I wasn't allowed to sell bitcoin for 100 SEK as I had planned. I'll just have to test the selling feature some other day instead. At least I now know that the limit function works as intended ;). The entrance door to the building was locked so I don't know if one is supposed to go inside by entering a door code or call someone through a door phone. I never got to reading any instructions about that because another person happened to be entering while I stood there so I simply followed that person to get in. The BTM had clear instructions on top of it and on it's monitor screen.
The verification (to raise the allowed daily limit currently from 500 SEK to 3000 SEK) process went fast as well (5-10 min) and there were chairs nearby to sit on while waiting for the verification text (sms) to arrive. The bitcoin I bought arrived nearly instantly, and I got a paper receipt with the blockchain transaction number and other details in case I'd ever need it.
tldr: All in all experience 8/10 in my opinion (-1 for the very likely not dangerous tiny gap just above the bill detector device, and -1 for the way too low placement of the camera making me look like a fool in front of the curious receptionist as I was taking a picture of my face).

The author of that google+ post makes good points. One cannot really compare the usd value of one bitcoin to the value of one stock in a given company. A company has expenses every month like paying rent and its employees' wages. Bitcoin as a system doesn't have those kinds of expenses and is therefore not sensitive in the same way if the value of one bitcoin drops very much very fast. The system can still be used, but at a lower per bitcoin value.
The imho most probable thing that could threaten the long-term value of one bitcoin is if a better and similar system replaces the bitcoin system, before bitcoin gets widely used and accepted. Maybe namecoin or something entirely different.
Let's say it would soon turn out that the actual value of one bitcoin is 0.01 usd. Then the bitcoin system would still remain very useful to me and people like me. The only change would be that I'd have to value one btc as 0.01 usd.
When all the greedy speculators leave bitcoin, the value will be much less than it is now. But the users who want to use it for it's usefulness will remain using it. When that has happened, the value of one bitcoin will stabilize and slowly begin to grow again, as new users adopt it. Perhaps we will experience more "greedy speculator"-bubbles once every two years or so? But each time the bubble bursts, the bitcoin system won't go bankrupt because the system costs neither office rent nor employee wages to maintain. Each time, the lowest value of one bitcoin would be higher than the last time the bubble bursted, because "I'm in it for the features, not the speculation"-users would've become more, and they'd still have to share the limited number of bitcoins (~21 million).
So when we reach the bottom and stay there for a while, I'll buy a nice amount of bitcoin again, and hope that no other feature-wise better system will be invented that would threaten the usage of the bitcoin system. Hopefully that new and better system won't replace bitcoin over night, giving me time to migrate my investment and involvement gradually, as it becomes more and more probable that bitcoin will become replaced.
And if it gets replaced by a better system, well, then we're just going to have an even better monetary system we could migrate to, which would be good. And as early adopters in that future and better system, we'd probably be able to make a buck there just as the early adopters likely made with bitcoin. I'd guess that better system would also have a cap similar to bitcoin's ~21 million coins, but with even more features that would warrant a migration.

I disagree. Miners *do* have a say over hard forks. I know most of you small blockers don't like activation thresholds of a 75 % majority vote and that you have the opinion that a soft fork is only acceptably safe with an activation threshold of 95 % or higher. Most of us big blockers think that 75 % is perfectly safe and that it's just as safe for hard forks as it is for soft forks.
The reason that we think differently about thresholds and whether miners have a say over hard forks or not is due to Bitcoin-politics.

I think it's quite possible that Gavin's blog account was hacked and that the hacker wrote that entire blog post in an attempt to discredit Gavin's reputation. Now that I think about it, it's been several hours since that "I believe that Craig is Satoshi" blog post was published but no other comments from Gavin at all despite all the heavy criticism in all subreddits. 
Another reason to suspect that Gavin's blog account has been hacked:
Gavin usually tweets a link to his blog post as soon as he publishes it. Gavin made no such tweet for this particular blog post. That's possibly because the hacker has hacked Gavin's blog account but not hacked Gavin's Twitter account.

Otherwise this subreddit will risk having posts removed based on one person's personal (well intended) judgement, instead of by consensus.

That way, a bitcoin user will have easy and immediate access to a reasonably small sum of their bitcoin without a bank being involved at all, and the rest of their bitcoin timelocked let's say for two years.
With a hardware wallet such as that there would be no point in burglarizing peoples homes, physically forcing them to transfer all of their bitcoin in one large transaction to the robber. Also, the bitcoin would still be in total control by the hardware wallet owner in case the bank would go bankrupt or refuse to co-sign a large transaction.
The worst case scenario would be that the hardware wallet owner would have to wait two years to be able to access all of their funds. In a world such as that, there would be minimal need for storing ones bitcoin in an ETF instead of as timelocked actual bitcoin.

I think steal is an appropriate word. By destroying Satoshi's unmoved coins, you would be in effect making your own coins worth more at the expense of the person who would otherwise have had / gained control over the Satoshi coins. We should not be allowed to destroy other people's bitcoin even if there are bitcoin that we know will be stolen by a thief. Let's not mess with the monetary supply and fungibility of Bitcoin. 
It would be immoral to intentionally cause a big deflationary boost to the Bitcoin economy with the excuse to prevent a limited one time 1 million bitcoin theft from occurring. It's better for the Bitcoin system as a whole to let such a theft occur.

My primary purpose of having bitcoin is that they are (soon) not inflationary in value. When I've worked and saved the money, I don't want to loose some of it to inflation each month. Yes, today bitcoin is actually very inflationary due to new bitcoins getting mined, but at least the rate is predetermined and not something politicians can change just because "fuck you, that's why". 
The secondary reason I bought today even when the currency hasn't yet been accepted and used regularly by the mainstream population, is because I guess that as more people find it to be useful, the value of my bitcoins will go up. I didn't buy more than I'd be comfortable loosing. There is always the risk of some other currency being invented that is even better than bitcoin. So I didn't bet all my savings on bitcoin.
The third reason is that there will be lower transaction costs (maybe even near zero) and no waiting for "bank days" just to transfer a kilobyte of data that represents my money. It's like the difference between mail and email. Email is so much faster and cheaper.
There are more reasons, but these were the main ones. I don't desire child porn nor do I want to buy drugs. The only drugs I consume is fat and sugar in the form of tasty food and candy. And Reddit. Those are all legal. Even so, I try to eat less and gym more.
I also don't hate anyone much enough to pay for a hit. I find it notable that no one has done that yet even though the bitcoin market cap was ~150*10^6 usd for a while some time ago. Maybe using bitcoin to pay for hits is like terrorism? Easy but still extremely few people choose to do so? That actually gives me a little more faith in humanity. Because as far as I understand it, hits could be 100 % anonymous if paid by bitcoin.

Ok, so let's say you put in 1.321 XBT into a coinjoin transaction. Two other people put in other amounts. Wouldn't it be as simple to see a link between your input and output, as by simply comparing the size of your input and output? If the size of the input and output are identical (1.321 XBT), then the sender and receiver is the same person. So how will transaction privacy have occurred in this case? 
I assume there is something more to it than has been illustrated by the example transaction in the linked infographic.

Also, please don't start naming the BIPs using the '+' character. I think Google ignores the plus character even if you use quotes around them. It would be better to name your different BIPs like "BIP103r1, BIP103r2, BIP103r3, etc" if you need to distinguish between different revisions of a specific BIP. Then it would be easy and quick to google each bip and revision for people who are unfamiliar with all the different suggested growth parameters.

It isn't actually that you need more than 8 connections. It's just that if you haven't configured your port forwarding correctly, your node will automatically stop trying to connect to more than 8 other nodes after it has connected to 8 nodes. 
If you have configured your port forwarding correctly on the other hand, other nodes will be able to find your node and ask it to establish an additional connection to them as well. 
With incorrect port forwarding configured, your computer will not listen to connection requests initiated by other nodes.

I've worked with three different Greeks in two different companies here in Sweden, and none of them have been lazier than any other of my coworkers, one German included. The problem with the Greek economy is systemic in my opinion, it's not a problem with their people per se. Everyone is born curious and full of desires and dreams. The problem is that the system around the individual often kills all that for some people, for reasons that are more complex than is generally perceived. And the social environment isn't the same even among siblings within the same family, much less the same within an arbitrary geographic area we've chosen to call "Europe". Yet we constantly tend to make these assumptions. 
If we can create a better system in which to live in, then given enough time, the people who live inside that system will start to regain their curiosity desires and dreams. We still use very similar political and economical systems that we were using hundreds of years ago, before we even discovered such things as the scientific method or even that the planet revolves around the sun and not the other way around. As a species we have a lot more innovation to do in this space. 
I'm not saying I'm better myself and have any good answers as to how to actually create a better society or system, all I'm saying is that I don't think it would be accurate at all to blame all of our troubles on the Greeks. The problem isn't lazy people. They are just a symptom of an actual problem. A problem that is systemic. Solve the systemic problem and given enough time (could maybe take generations, but give it time, it's the only way) you'll find a civilization full of happy and excited individuals who are living much closer to their full potential.

So according to the linked newspaper article, government agencies have publicly confirmed that they have chosen to pay ransom two out of three times, to get their own data back from hackers? 
This sets a dangerous precedent to any criminals who are considering taking these and other kinds (in this case the hostage was data) of hostages. The authorities have just publicly confirmed that they are willing to "negotiate with terrorists" if the price is right.
Maybe I'm the last person on this planet to find out, but I've always thought that the "we never negotiate with terrorists/kidnappers" idea in Hollywood movies were actually how it worked in real life as well.
If the police are willing to pay ransom depending on the size of the ransom, then their citizens are also in principle vulnerable to kidnappings, because it can now be assumed that the police are likely going to recommend "just pay the ransom and get your relative back; the ransom they're asking for is reasonable". 
The "we never negotiate with terrorists" is only effective if they actually never negotiate with terrorists. Yet again, I seem to have wrongfully trusted Hollywood movies to teach me the truth about how the world works. I never learn.

Good. Now you don't have to invest anymore. Now I'd recommend that you spend your time and effort on securing and keeping your bitcoins secure (learn about proper cold storage and practice recovering lower test amounts from backups etc), and wait a few years until your coins have hopefully grown considerably in value. 
Don't panic sell when the price crashes (it does with regular intervals due to the inherent volatility) and don't "panic invest" too much when the price seems low so you don't have a comfortable amount of reserve fiat to support you in case you need quick money for any (often unexpected) reasons.
I see you've revealed your exact amount of bitcoin savings (21 bitcoin) "publicly" to I know it may be exciting to reach your investment goal, but I'd nevertheless recommend that you think twice in the future about whom you reveal your exact savings to. There is no need to attract curious hackers to try to take your coins away from you. They'll happily try to do that anyway.
So, split up your coins into 10 different hardware devices now while they're still worth comparatively little, so that in the future you won't ever have to risk more than one tenth of your bitcoin savings at any one time. Plan ahead, because some day you'll want to use some of your bitcoins, and you won't want to have to expose your entire savings when making just one smaller transaction.
Set a predetermined usd/xbt rate where you'll use a portion of your bitcoin long term savings. Let's say ten times your purchase price, in your case 3100 usd/xbt. Decide now how much you'll spend at that price level. Let's say ten %, in your case 2.1 xbt. Then set the next rate, for example 31 000 usd/xbt, etc. That way you can stick to your plan and not risk having your future emotions affecting your financial decisions for you. We're all human and none of us should underestimate the power of subconscious emotions. Panic selling and greed can affect even the most rational human. Expect that and plan accordingly. I've seen a lot of those two emotions in particular, from otherwise very logical people.
Make a plan as to how you should respond to whenever you hear about an interesting altcoin. New altcoins (competing coins to bitcoin) appear and disappear constantly, and you are going to be tempted to sell some of your bitcoins in order to buy a new altcoin as they get announced. Learn about Namecoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin for example. 
Then try to anticipate how you should react whenever the next altcoin gets created, released and announced. That way you will be more likely to not sell a significant amount of your long term bitcoin savings in order to be able to buy that future altcoin, and a few months later regret your decision and loss. Or vice versa; there is always a possibility that another future coin will be so much more functional than bitcoin, that it will compete with and defeat bitcoin as a currency and a system, making you regret that you held onto your bitcoin and didn't convert to the new altcoin. That said, bitcoin has been in existance for so many years now (six years) that it grows increasingly unlikely that it will be replaces by a competing future altcoin due to [network effect]( My point is to anticipate and have a plan for those future emotions so you don't act irrationally.
Buy a 100 usd worth of bitcoin that you can set aside to your hot wallet so that you have a little money you can play with. That way you can participate moderately in the new bitcoin economy without thinking about what effect your participation will have on your long time savings. 
Never daytrade. You'll make enough money just holding for a few years. Leave daytrading to the gamblers or professionals. Daytrading feels easy but is actually extremely difficult.
Prepare by creating accounts on a few exchanges and verifying your identity by uploading whatever AML/KYC documents they demand. When the exchange rate of bitcoin goes up very fast, everyone tries to verify their accounts at the same time overwhelming the humans that work there, and then when you're finally allowed to sell your coins, the price may have already crashed again. Read up on which exchanges you're going to trust with your identity documents so that you don't have your documents leak to any kind of identity thiefs. Exchanges get hacked and don't trust too many exchanges.
Prepare a bank account where you can withdraw money from your future bitcoin sales. Ideally you should have your bitcoin related account with a separate bank than the bank you use to pay your rent and food with. Some banks freeze bank accounts when they suddenly decide that bitcoin activity is considered to be risky. Sure, they won't actually take your money permanently, but may hold them for several weeks until you're allowed to transfer them to a different bank. 
What if you have to pay your rent at that particular moment in time? Plan ahead. And make a small test transaction so that you see that things are really working. Never hold any funds on an exchange more than one day. Every day every exchange risks getting hacked. Just ask anyone who stored funds at Mtgox and they'll give the same recommendation.
Learn how to pay taxes before you need to know how to declare your bitcoin profits. What if the exchange rate spikes in the same week that your country is expecting its citizens to declare taxes? Then you'd have only one month to learn how to declare your taxes or face hefty fines if you'd be late reporting them. Put aside your owed taxes in the form of fiat and not in the form of bitcoin. You don't want to tell your government that you cannot afford to pay your taxes because the exchange rate of bitcoin just crashed. They're very unlikely to show you any sympathy for your losses. So have that money in a fiat bank account (not on a bitcoin exchange that may get hacked at any point in time).
Good luck! :P.
**Tldr:** A short list of the next steps after you've reached your goal of owning 21 xbt. A short list that got longer and longer and turned out to become a long list.

Good question actually. Litecoin has a de facto 4 times larger blocksize limit than Bitcoin because Litecoin generates a new block once in 2.5 minutes instead of once in 10 minutes. Litecoin was started and has been running since at least 2011 IIRC. 
So why has no one attacked the Litecoin network even though their blocks can be de facto 4 times larger than the blocks of Bitcoin? Their blocks have never been larger than 20 KB according to  (You have to click "Time span: All time" on the web page.).
So if Litecoin miners have never created an accepted de facto 4 MB block, then why do we think that Bitcoin miners would ever create a 4 MB accepted (not orpaned) block if we would raise the Bitcoin limit to 4 MB today?
So if more than half of the Bitcoin miners would think that a, let's say, 3 MB block would be unreasonably big, then they would just orphan that block, right? And if not, then there would be no problem since then it would be obvious that at least 50 % of the miners can properly handle 3 MB blocks.
Also, there are more than 100 altcoins today. Has none of them tried to remove their blocksize limit? Really? That doesn't seem very "alternative" to never have tried that.

Oh, ok. In that case the price of one ETF certificate will probably update frequently and closely follow the exchange rates of the bitcoin exchanges that they mentioned, while the ETF exchange is open for trading.
I wonder if someone is going to buy or sell a quite large amount of bitcoin on the low volume Gemini and Itbit exchanges (significantly affecting their exchange rates) in an attempt to get a good price on a very large amount of ETF certificates. 
It may be worth the sacrifice if the volume will continue to be low on Gemini and Itbit, and the ETF administrator does not react quickly enough to the spread between Gemini / Itbit and the rest of the exchanges.

1\. What do you think will happen if the Ethereum hard fork happens with 75 % yes and 25 % no votes?  
2\. Will the same thing(s) happen to them, that would happen to Bitcoin, if a 75-yes-25-no BIP109 limit hard fork would happen?  
3\. Will there be two active chains of Ethereum after the contentious hard fork where the smaller of the forks changes their PoW algorithm?  
4\. Will the ETH exchange rate crash for one or both of the forks causing a system-wide failure, the same way as a failure is predicted for Bitcoin should a 75-yes-25-no contentious hard fork ever occur?
Personally I think that only the 75 % side of the ETH fork will survive and that the 25 % side will die unceremoniously. The ETH market cap will retain more than 50 % of its pre-fork value, one week after the contentious hard fork event. The reason I say only 50 % is because both Ethereum and Bitcoin are volatile even when no hard forks are happening. 
My point is that I don't think such a contentious (75-25) hard fork will affect the exchange rate in any significant amount. At least not downwards.
I can't of course be entirely sure that I'm right in my predictions. That's why I think it's interesting to observe what will actually happen in the Ethereum 75-25 contentious hard fork. Whatever happens will likely also happen to Bitcoin if Bitcoin would ever perform a 75-25 contentious hard fork.

That blog post claims that Coinbase's burn rate is estimated at approximately 40 million USD per year and that their revenue is reported as 20 million USD per year. The blog post author wrote that Coinbase has *an estimated* 50-200 employees according to a source called "Glass Door".
Ok, so how did the blog post author reach the burn rate number of 40 million USD per year? He wrote that he had assumed that Coinbase employee salaries are about half (48 %) of Coinbase's total yearly expenses. Sure, I see no problem with that assumption. So, he assumed that the salaries costs 20 million (half of 40 million) USD per year. Therefore he must have assumed that Coinbase has (at least!) 20 000 000 / 121 000 == 165 employees.
So the entire argument that Coinbase is not turning a profit is based *on the assumption* that Coinbase has no less than 165 employees when all we know is that Coinbase has a reported number of employees as somewhere between 50-200. So if Coinbase has 1 employee less than 165 employees, they suddenly become a profitable company.
**Conclusion:** What a **speculative blog post based on** nothing but an **arbitrary assumption** (Assumption made: **The number of Coinbase employees being more than 165 even though the blog post author himself admits he only knows that Coinbase has somewhere between 50-200 employees according to the source he used.**).

Well he travels a lot, regularly crossing time zones. No wonder a person gets tired from that. Also saying "nothing to be concerned about" should be said carefully. Never underestimate the risk of burning out from working unreasonably much. Hopefully he'll have some bitcoins saved by now that he could use in case he feels the need to take a break from work, avoiding risking a burnout. Or maybe royalties from his book could afford him a break if needed.

So, more specifically, you're claiming that you've intentionally obligated your company (Blockstream) by law to never sue the Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin XT projects, its developers, managers and the users of the software that those projects are developing, as long as the managers of those projects don't sue your company for patent infringements? Is that correct?
Have you similarly obligated your company Blockstream to never sue the Coinbase company for patent infringements as long as Coinbase does not sue Blockstream for patent infringements? Are these promises that your company Blockstream has made *really* legally binding and enforceable or would you be allowed to break, change or modify these promises without legal consequences sometime in the future?
What happens if you sell your company Blockstream. Would the new owner be allowed to use the purchased / acquired patents without keeping this promise made by Blockstream never to sue unless sued first?

I've been running my current bitcoind node 24/7 on a dedicated consumer grade (Intel) 80 GB SSD for over three years now and not gotten a single read/write error yet. Bitcoind almost only *reads* from the drive, it *writes* very rarely to it. Writing 1 MB each 10 minutes is very very little and is well below what is expected that an SSD should be able to handle. The only thing that wears an SSD down over time is writing data to it, not reading data from it.[1]
Using an HDD however, would wear it down much faster because the moving parts inside it needs to move even if only reading data and not writing. With that said, I've still not seen any complaints from people using HDD's either, so I guess the reads are insignificant enough so that they don't wear down HDD's either.

Yes, it would be interesting to hear what Richard Stallman would think about this whole Blockstream patenting situation. 
It still feels like Blockstream could abuse their patents against the community if they would choose to do so (by selling their patents to a party that finds a loophole to be allowed to use the patents offensively). They should at the very least consult with the GPL father and public figure Richard Stallman on how to prevent the possibility for future abuse and have Richard make a public statement regarding this situation. Wikipedia did when they changed their licensing many years ago. 
And why didn't they just use GPL version 3? Isn't that license designed for these kinds of situations?
Why didn't they create a separate patent pool organization that cooperates with Coinbase (who also have Bitcoin patents and claim to want to use them only defensively) *before* applying for actual patents? I'm still skeptical to both Blockstream and Coinbase patents. I think it's likely that they will sometimes in the future turn out to be a net negative for the Bitcoin ecosystem. 
It's suspicious that Blockstream and Coinbase are not using the same patent pool with the same licenses and the same pledges, if their purpose is *truly* to be only defensive. Why has Brian Armstrong been quiet about this? It's like both Coinbase and Blockstream are trying to give the impression to be only defensive but unofficially try to keep the ability to be offensive.

So the bid and ask prices change only once per 24 hours? And the actual trade also executes only once per 24 hours? That does not seem good. It sounds as if I've misunderstood something, right?

If I would be a merchant who received a random dirty coin of lets say 0.001337 bitcoins, I would simply have a dedicated "dirty coins storage address" that I send exactly 0.001337 coins to, the next time I spend anything from my "clean" address. About once a month, I would send whatever content of my "dirty coins storage address" to a state controlled collection address. That way all of my clean addresses would be legitimately purged of dirty coins each month, defeating the "problem" of receiving random dirty coins.

Tor has a binary file that takes care of anything.

You can download and run the "bitcoin core" client from bitcoin.org on your home desktop computer. It's a full node by default. I'd recommend to devote an 80 GB SSD for the files that the node has to store (it grows by up to 1 MB every 10 minutes on average). There is also a torrent you could download that contains most of the blockchain files if you'd want to speed up the initial process of downloading the full blockchain for storing locally. But if you're patient, you don't need that torrent file. 
Edit 1:
I forgot to mention:
You also need to "port forward" your port number 8333 to the computer running your node, in your router. After you've configured your router to forward that port, you can verify that you've done it correctly by visiting this page: 
That page will fill in your IP address and port automatically, and when you press "check", it'll tell you if you've configured your router correctly or not.

That's all great, but if I have car trouble I ask my car mechanic for advice, and not my doctor who happens to be very interested in cars and has experience driving around the world several times. A car mechanic has a very specialized knowledge and understanding about cars. Patent lawyers such as Kat have very specialized knowledge and understanding about patent law.
Your knowledge and understanding as a CTO / programmer are very specialized about programming. My questions to Kat were not about programming so her answers are more valuable, relevant and interesting than yours in this context. You're an excellent programmer Greg, but you're not an economist and certainly not any kind of a lawyer. 
There is no shame in accepting your limitations. I'm not specialized in any kind of specific skillset for example, and I feel no shame for that. Different people are good at different things. I'm sure Kat has spent an equal amount of time learning about patent law as you have spent learning about C++ programming.

I think there are merchants who already have regular customers who buy products and services using fiat, but wanted to get more customers by offering their goods also for bitcoin. For them even one extra customer is profit that they wouldn't have had otherwise. And if they used Bitpay to insta-convert to fiat, then they took no currency risk for the deal(s). If on the other hand they chose to take a currency risk, then they probably know enough about bitcoin to not freak out for a mere 20 % weekend price drop, and are holding for a while. So I don't think this drop will cause any significant trouble for most merchants.

Yet they did not outlaw the internet as it grew. Why is that? Perhaps they saw that the benefits outweighed their previous control of information and communication.

I agree that there are differences in my analogy and not only similarities. They cannot be ignored. However, I don't think I'm being irrational when I use a small fraction of my bitcoins for purchases. They are just so useful. Let's say I set aside 200 USD for fun things per month, and I do. I could either keep them as fiat and spend them by debit card, or convert them in the beginning of the month into bitcoin and then use them as bitcoins instead.
I agree that I don't feel comfortable spending my 200 USD worth of bitcoins if their purchasing power have dropped to 150 USD, which happen quite often. But then I just wait a few days, weeks or months until they have become worth more than 200 USD. And then I can start spending them. No fun for me until that happens, but when it happens, I can spend bitcoins ignoring the exchange rate because as long as it is above the original 200 USD, it feels to me like "free extra money".
In fact, that has already happened to me a few times. I have a bitcointip account that I loaded with some money a while ago. I am an unlucky person, so the purchasing power tanked soon after my purchase. But now it is more than what I bought them for, so I can afford to use the tipping bot as originally intended, despite the deflation I've experienced and continue to experience.
I've also done the same with a mobile phone bitcoin wallet. I filled it with a few satoshis and the value tanked. Some time later the value has risen above the original value and I now use those bitcoins whenever I feel like it and don't think much about it. I've bought some cheap stuff on Bitmit and it feels like free money even though I understand intellectually that the money I'm spending is as real as it gets.
I don't think the way I feel and reason is unique to me. I think it is a common way of feeling and thinking, don't you? If you agree, then don't you think the experienced deflation over time isn't a problem? If and when Bitcoin adoption has become significant, then the exchange rate will fluctuate much less, and even the high yearly deflation will slow down significantly, I believe.

The price fell from about 32 usd/btc to about 2 usd/btc in the last bubble. That is about 94%. Is it reasonable to assume that whenever the next bubble bursts that it again will fall about 94% before rising again? 
That would mean that if it is a bubble now, and it will burst right this minute, then the price will not crash below 11.56 usd/btc. Right?
Calculation: 2/32*185=11.5625 usd/btc.

The largest bubble burst was at ~32 USD, not 30. Also, nothing special happened when it went from 5 to 10 in august this year. So I don't think that these nice and even numbers affect the rate that much.
What I think matters more is whenever someone has doubled their money. Let's say someone bought at 7. Then what matters to that person is when the price reaches 14. And since everyone buys at different values, there will be no special values where everything happens simultaneously. I think :).

The computer you typed that from is also a part of a deflationary price spiral, as you call it. Why did you buy that computer when you knew that just one year later the same money would give you a computer twice as powerful? 
It's the same with Bitcoin. Just because your money becomes more and more valuable each year, doesn't mean you'll stop using it. The only difference is that the computer you can purchase becomes 10 times as powerful for each year instead of 2 times as powerful for each year.
Bitcoin is a very useful way of storing and transferring value. In essence, it's just a tool. Right now there aren't a lot of people who have heard of and know how to use this specific tool, but just as people have learned over time how to use a computer and even Facebook, they'll given enough time learn how to use Bitcoin as well. It's just another tool to people.

Only 4 % sounds wonderfully little. I wonder though how many of those 225 million bitcoins where being moved from one person to themselves. I sometimes move around my coins for example between different wallets, and those moves shouldn't "count".
At the same time I wonder how many of those 9.5 million bitcoins where moved from one person to themselves.
The point is, how sure can we be that Silkroad accounted for 4 % of the total bitcoin economy volume during that period, and not some other amount? I really wish 4 % is true, because the true future of bitcoin adoption will be caused by mainstream usage, not by trading drugs usage.

The point I'm one of the advocators for, is that money having intrinsic value is not mandatory in order for the money to be a good money. Many people seem to believe that money without intrinsic value cannot be good money. But I think that that is not true. Cigarettes in prison is a good example of a good money that has intrinsic value. You can use it as money or smoke it. But you don't smoke USD, EUR or XBT (BTC). Yet all of those currencies function well as currencies. Gold happens to have intrinsic value, but that is not what makes gold good as a money.
"The world consumption of new gold produced is about 50% in jewelry, 40% in investments, and 10% in industry."
So I'd say 60 % of gold's value can be explained by its industrial and jewelry use. Let's say the industry and the jewelers would stop using gold entirely. Then gold would still keep its 40 % value that it has from the investments demand. Until bitcoin has eaten more and more of gold's use as an investment/store of value :). It's going to be interesting to see how much of a dent bitcoin will be able to cause over the coming few years, to gold's 6000 year long history as a preferred store of value mechanism.

Oh, so a 300 000 SEK withdrawal to a Swedbank account would not be a problem via Safello? That's nice to hear, always good to have options.
The capital gains tax is exactly 30 % in Sweden, right? No matter what size ones salary is from ones day job?
However, you've had this message on your site for quite a while now:
"För tillfället kan vi inte erbjuda möjligheten att sälja Bitcoins. Vi kommer inom kort att lansera denna tjänst."
So it's not currently possible to sell xbt and withdraw fiat from you at all? Any timeframe when that will become possible?
Your spread between what you buy and sell xbt for is significantly larger than the spread on Mtgox or Bitstamp for example, if I remember correctly. Currently I cannot find any info about your spread on your site. Also, if I would sell xbt through Safello, exactly when would the price be determined? Will it be agreed before I press the "confirm" button on your site, or will it be an as of yet undetermined price because it's determined at the time Safello sells my xbt on an exchange? For me it is important to know the exact price before I press "confirm".
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:38:52
I think they understand that it affects fiat but also see the similarities to when the Internet was new. It's better for those in power to be the sole provider of information, but they saw that the benefits of allowing the growth of Internet outweighed the loss. I think they see bitcoin in the way. That the benefits are larger than to outlaw it. I too shared your opinion before I watched the recorded hearings.

Ok, so how much will it cost to send the equivalent of 100 USD in bitcoin, five or ten years from now? Let's assume a woldwide adoption of bitcoin, just like the internet protocol has been adopted globally. Then there will be a lot of people competing to have their transaction included into the blockchain. 
One very important advantage of the Bitcoin system compared to legacy systems is the very low transaction fees. Is that not going to be a reality anymore a few years from now? What are some future transaction fee scenarios, with different kinds of limits on maximum block sizes?

So how would this work? Would two people find each other on the distributed "Zero Reserve"-exchange and then person A would make a bank transfer to person B's personal bank account, and person B would in turn send XBT to person A's bitcoin address?
Wouldn't that raise a flag and make the bank freeze the bank account of person B for receiving let's say 20 000 USD from perhaps 20 different people from all over the world? Yes, this would be better than using a centralized exchange, but would probably be troublesome for larger transactions.

Yeah and my gut tells me a society where people spend money only on the things they really want to spend money on, is a better society for all than the society where people throw away money on things they don't really want that much. I know economists and politicians wants us to spend and consume more and that they think it is better for our society, but it just doesn't feel like they are correct about that. I'm not an economist so I can't describe it in a convincing way unfortunately. Maybe someone can.

In my opinion miners do have an incentive to raise the block size cap. They actually simultaneously have both an incentive to keep the block size small, and have an incentive to keep the block size large. Let's look at the latter incentive since that is the one that we disagree on:
Imagine the extreme scenario where the miners never vote for an increase in block size, forever forscing it to remain capped at 1 MB per block. After enough time has passed and bitcoin adoption has grown, then people would have to pay for example 100 USD per transaction. That would stagnate the usage of the bitcoin network. If the miners would vote for a larger block size, then they would get less transaction fees per transaction, let's say 0.1 USD, but a hell of a lot of many more transactions, making the total amount of transaction fees they get per block much larger.
The optimal block size cap in the eyes of miners is growing constantly as the bitcoin adoption grows.

It sounds a bit like how ip packets travel through the tcp/ip internet system. You never know what path one specific ip packet will travel.

I transfered a few satoshis to a blockchain.info android wallet a while ago for "pocket change". I too didn't want to use my pocket change because it felt wrong to spend something that valuable. But after a while my pocket change had doubled in value. It was still pocket change but now I had twice as much. So I figured since this is my pocket change I might as well use the "free" money portion of it, and stop using my pocket change once it becomes as large as my initial upload of btc.
A while later, the price crashed a bit, and I stopped using my "expensive" pocket change. But another while later the value went up again and I got another amount of "free money" that I again started using. Now it has grown so much that it is unlikely that it will ever crash down to my original btc upload. So I have quite a lot of "free pocket change" that I don't mind using. I've never touched my btc savings account, but my pocket change account is just that: pocket change. With extra free btc in it :).
I also did the same with my bitcointip bot account. I loaded it up with some pocket change I thought I'd use to tip redditors with. I didn't feel comfortable using it because you know bitcoin is so valuable. But when it doubled in value, I thought "I'll keep whatever I originally loaded my tipping account with and use the free bitcoins to tip with". So now everytime I tip someone it feels free for me so I do it even more often than I would've done if it was a fiat tipping bot.

Wouldn't it be better to just let them create their two-kinds-of-bitcoins system and ignore the difference between "clean" and "dirty" coins? What would happen if we just let them do this?
My initial brainstorming reaction would be that this will happen:
There will be two different kinds of bitcoin systems, one "clean" and one "dirty". The blockchain would be the same for both systems, and the miners would be the same, software the same etc.
But wait a minute - I change my opinion. Maybe they'll (try to) forbid the more and more centralized miners and miner pools to include transactions that come from "unclean" addresses. Then (if they succeed) they'll in effect have taken our bitcoin system away from us and made it their own.
Hmm... It is probably worth fighting this. We should do to them what they seem to intend to do to us: Refuse transactions from "clean" addresses. We should do this at all levels possible; miners and miner pools should refuse to include their attempted transactions, bitcoin client software should refuse to relay their attempted transactions, web wallets and bitcoin exchanges should refuse to handle them etc.
It may not work to resist this, but it is probably worth it to at least try to resist it before "their" bitcoin system becomes big enough to be usable and tempting to accept.

I don't think anyone would object your thanking for the tip. As to my purpose of tipping you, I just thought that if I load up your tipping account with some bucks, you may after some time share the same experience I've had in regard to how I perceive bitcoin value. That is, maybe when the value of the tip has doubled, you too will feel that using the "free extra money" will feel "free" to use. And after you've used it and it reaches 10 usd again, you just wait until it doubles again.
The best way to share my thoughts on the matter was to share the experience. So that's (the main reason) why I tipped you.
Oh, and then a likely follow-up thought might be that "10 usd cannot constantly keep doubling in value", "so your way of thinking about the value of bitcoin must eventually come to an end". Yes, I agree, but when it stops doubling it only means that there are no new bitcoin users in the world. Just like Facebook user number growth has basically stopped because there simply are not many people left who don't already have a Facebook account. So when your 10 usd stops doubling, it only means "everyone" is using bitcoin, and the value of bitcoin has become very stable (no inflation because almost all is already mined, and no new users anymore so also no deflation anymore).
And when bitcoin value has become stable, you wont feel awkward spending that last 10 usd of yours :).
..either that or the whole bitcoin project crashes for some unfortunate "black swan event" as they're called. But even then you won't mind using that last "10 usd" of yours ;).

"Early credit cards in the U.S., of which BankAmericard was the most prominent example, were mass produced and mass mailed unsolicited to bank customers who were thought to be good credit risks. But, "They have been mailed off to unemployables, drunks, narcotics addicts and to compulsive debtors, a process President Johnson's Special Assistant Betty Furness found very like 'giving sugar to diabetics'."[8]  
These mass mailings were known as "drops" in banking terminology, and were outlawed in 1970 due to the financial chaos they caused, but not before 100 million credit cards had been dropped into the U.S. population. After 1970, only credit card applications could be sent unsolicited in mass mailings."

It currently takes a lot of time to transfer fiat out from Mtgox for people who want to do so. That makes people less prone to use Mtgox for selling bitcoins, so "no one wants to sell bitcoins on Mtgox". But buying bitcoins is not a problem. So there are a lot of buyers because of Mtgox's historical popularity. When there are a lot of buyers and very few sellers, then the price gets a little affected by that. 
I think that is why you see a higher price on Mtgox compared to other exchanges that does not currently have this fiat withdrawal problem, and it seems to be a common belief.

The benefit would be that I could have less of my savings in fiat. The idea would be to have just as little fiat on my account as I would need, and have the rest in bitcoin. As it is now, I have 1-2 monthly salaries in fiat because almost all things I buy on a monthly basis can only be paid with fiat. If everything on my list could be bought with bitcoin, I would only need to have like half a monthly salary in fiat, and could have the rest in bitcoin, which would likely appreciate in value instead of decreasing in value due to inflation.

For the lazy:
"Definition of 'Anti-Fragility'  
A postulated antithesis to fragility where high-impact events or shocks can be beneficial. Anti-fragility is a concept developed by professor, former trader and former hedge fund manager Nassim Nicholas Taleb. Taleb coined the term "anti-fragility" because he thought the existing words used to describe the opposite of "fragility," such as "robustness," were inaccurate. Anti-fragility goes beyond robustness; it means that something does not merely withstand a shock but actually improves because of it.
Investopedia explains 'Anti-Fragility'  
For example, he describes an anti-fragile trading strategy as one that does not merely withstand a turbulent market but becomes more appealing under such conditions. Another example he gives is weight lifting, which trains muscles not just to withstand heavy lifting but to develop increased strength as the body repairs the muscle fiber tears. Taleb discusses anti-fragility in his books, "The Black Swan," "Fooled By Randomness" and his 2012 book "Antifragility."

I've also read that an important reason credit/debit cards reached mass adoption back when everyone was using cash, was because they spammed peoples physical mailboxes with letters containing plastic cards with credit on them. 
Has Paypal reached mass adoption without resorting to this kind of spamming? If yes, then that gives hope for Bitcoin to reach mass adoption without resorting to similar spamming.

I actually think that the Americans are excellently equipped to handle the complexities of unit conversions, like btc; milli-btc; micro-btc; satoshis etc. They already seem to be able to handle much more difficult and illogical units of measure such as yards, feet, inches, pounds, stones and whatever the imperial system uses instead of our logical metric system.
I mean, look at this picture to see how arbitrary the imperial system is compared to our logical metric system:
If they can handle that, then they can handle anything metric if they would just choose to learn it. It's much simpler. And for those that don't understand neither imperial nor metric units, they can simply always use satoshis and simply ask "Yeah, I don't really understand - how many satoshis would that be?".

Soon we will have cities with &gt; 100 population, er, merchants. [This comment may look silly a few years from now].
