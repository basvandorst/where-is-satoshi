That's true. But think psychologically, the world biggest and probably like the only  exchange is down and the btc world went to hell. Everything look bleak.  If you have the coins then would you not sell? Probably might even sell it at lower than 400.
If you think lost opportunity, ask yourself, would you have bought more coins back then in the aftermath of mtgox hack?
