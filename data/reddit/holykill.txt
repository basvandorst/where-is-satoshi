Very happy to hear about your positive experience in Armenia!
Yes, by adoption I mean daily payments. But for that I assume we first need to give Bitcoin a legal status and thus allow merchants accept Bitcoin. Or otherwise we need to do some sort of instant BTC-AMD conversion on transaction and send the payment in local currency to bank/tax authority just as credit cards are being charged.
Indeed, we should spread the idea of Bitcoin. But the positive thing is, that Armenia is such a small and talkative country, that if the current government that is fully trusted by people begins talking about it, the word of mouth will immediately reach everyone. That is why I am trying to come up with a reasonable plan, persuade the government and cascade the topic of Bitcoin from the very top.
I keep mentioning legislation and legal status because as I understand until a status is given, everything physical done through Bitcoin is illegal. For example, a shop accepting a payment in Bitcoin won't pay taxes and the product sold stays afloat in the papers. Or say, a physical BTC exchanges can be looked at as a fraud or legal uncertainty. i.e. it doesn't look right that a person walks into some store, hands out money and walks out, while the store doesn't have a clear status of what activities it is doing, it is making profit and again is not being taxed.

Accepting Bitcoin and immediately converting to local currency would be a great starting point. However, it needs special, locally developed software that works with local banks and taxing authorities, correct? I know that there are applications in US doing the instant BTC-USD conversion for businesses and charging a small commission. Would something like that be easy to develop here with the local currency?

That seems to be an incorrect calculation. This [one]( is more accurate and estimates +3.74%.

Note that it's 'blnance' not 'binance'. You can see that in the URL. Cheap scam, need to report to apple.
Edit: Reported it [here](

What website are you using to see these stats?

There are 3,000 miners in the farm as of now, soon to become 120,000. It's not the biggest farm yet but once all the equipment is brought in, it might become one.

This website has 107 coins on the contrary to CoinMarketCap's 1700, hence the difference.

Any clue why shitcoins are trending and BTC market % is going down?
@_date: 2018-04-08 12:27:26
All the December-January purchases arrived in February-March. The spikes we see on the graph indicate that someone is regularly turning a huge quantity of miners on and off.

Could you elaborate?

If 42 is halved, it becomes 21 and that is exactly how many million Bitcoins will ever exist. Illuminati confirmed.
