It's trusting that they won't suddenly go under. It's based on 243 years of being a continuous government. I don't have to like Chick Fillet's stance on gay marriage to acknowledge they make good chicken. I don't have to like Donald trump to admit that the US is a strong economy.

I have a degree in law and economics but thanks for the personal attack.

It shouldn't be. It will lead to people hoarding and not purchasing goods and services which will lead to a stake economy.

Fiat currency is based on the government's word which in the case of advanced economies, is pretty good.

Until when though

I don't know of anybody that "hoards" fiat currency. I'm sure they exist but I don't know them. Putting money into a bank is not hoarding it though. Its being invested whether at 1% on a savings or at 8% in a mutual fund. That is money that recirculates. Hoarding would be keeping it in your sock drawer.

Exchange could help recirculation especially if its not actually tied to a literal bitcoin. I studied economics in law school and I think I know more about bitcoin than the average person but I'm not in any way an expert on it. I'm still actually kind of hazy on the whole ledger stuff even though I took an entire semester on FinTech. But in a savings your money grows. On an exchange it doesnt.

The problem keeping it from mass adoption is that using bitcoin is too slow and expensive.

Why not just use Coinbase and pay way less in fees?

This sub is cancer for what Bitcoin is supposed to be for. Everyone here is just trying to get rich, not actually lead to adoption of a currency.

Who says I didn't. A lot of people thought that's a great time to buy before it goes in to the 20s.

For losing 50% of some of your investments? Not exactly a WorldCom situation here.

I wrote this really long post on r/sex about anxiety and it got removed by the automoderator because it contained the term "first time" and it said "see the sidebar" yet there are dozens of posts saying "I want to be my boyfriend's cum dumpster". I messaged the mods to whitelist my post but never got a response. Tried to resubmit it without that term but it wouldn't let me. It made me really upset and like I wasted time. 
Moral of the story: over policing subreddits also has its problems.

Because that's based on actual sales and profit, not imagination.

Daily Mail is by definition a tabloid.
