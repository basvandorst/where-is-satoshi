In theory if the exchange has the private key for the address they can recover the funds regardless of which chain they were sent on. This is why you should generally only send funds to addresses which you control though as it would be an easy fix if you had the private key.

It's not Bitcoin we're hostile towards, in fact we quite wish we could use and promote Bitcoin again like we used to. Most of us are hostile only to the new developers who came on the scene late and messed everything up. I want the original Bitcoin back, with the original plan and original developers. This is the sentiment shared by most big players in the industry. We all wish we could just kill Bitcoin Cash and get back to the main chain, but circumstances force us away.

@_date: 2018-01-14 03:57:59
'Satoshi' is just a name. I couldn't care less who the person was. The point is that what he said, along with the code he wrote, represents the plan that a lot of us originally signed up for. It's fine if you don't believe he was correct, and in that case you should be free to experiment with your new ideas on a separate chain. The onus should not fall on the original network participants to make a new chain just to follow the original plan, the onus should be on those who feel the plan is wrong to make their own chain.
@_date: 2018-01-14 02:28:05
Why do you believe the requirements are wrong, and do you think Bitcoin miners aren't already spending tens of millions of dollars on mining equipment?
@_date: 2018-01-14 05:05:43
I'm talking about removing the arbitrary and harmful block size limit, as is the entire topic of your post. That's the idea. That's the plan. That's always been the plan. It is exceedingly obvious that you didn't sign up for any plan. You and all of the other latecomers who rallied for a broken design which has now completely ruined the usability of the chain. The scalability requirements you've articulated quite well. It's the solution you're having a hard time with. The solution is simply to increase the block size limit to account for the transactions. It really is that simple.

You would rather you be paid a slightly higher denomination of an inflationary currency, even though it buys you a whole lot less?

Large industrial mining was always the plan. Just because participants have costs in the tens of millions doesn't mean it's centralized. They are all self motivated and this is the primary incentive structure that makes the network function in the first place. Originally all nodes were mining nodes, there was no distinction. Since mining is competitive, naturally economies of scale come into play. Satoshi stated that as the network grew, mining would be left more and more to specialists with server farms and specialized hardware - this is the case today with mining, and can be the case with full nodes as well just as when the network was first created.

Should be fine. As long as they have the private key for their Bitcoin Cash wallet they can still access the Bitcoin. A lot of wallets support both BTC and BCH these days so you can pretty much use them interchangeably.

That's kind of a weird analogy. A better analogy might be the small core truck, and the big cash truck, though the cash truck still has a lot more available room as it's nowhere near full.

Yea, a private key will generate the same address on the Bitcoin Cash chain as it will on the Bitcoin chain - an exception to this might be segwit addresses, but not many people seem to use those yet.

If they're on an exchange, you don't control the keys. If you had the private keys you wouldn't need to contact support as you would simply be able to send the bch back. This is why it's important to control your own keys.

Bitcoin Cash is not limited, yet I can fully validate every block. Not only that, I can actually spend it, or send it anywhere in the world for virtually no cost.

I doubt ln will be very private if all transactions are hopping through a small handful of centralized hubs, which is what will likely happen.
I'm curious though, when you talk about Bitcoin Cash code and developers, which implementation and development team are you referring to specifically?
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:33:02
The plural of bitcoin is bitcoin. You have several bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:16:24
Bitcoin is just an idea. The first implementation we saw worked fairly well, though over time we changed that implementation. For example, we now have things like Segwit, and soon Lighting - if the community agrees, we'll continue to call those things Bitcoin. If the community doesn't agree however, or finds another code implementation that fits the idea better, then maybe we'll call that other thing Bitcoin instead.
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:26:53
You won't last long around here asking questions like that.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:37:17
Yes it works just fine as long as you pay the fee. I send transactions all the time using both address formats and the fees are currently $20-40 regardless of which method you use. This isn't secondhand hearsay from rbtc but rather first hand experience from actually using bitcoin. Anyone can go google 'bitcoin average fees' and look at any source they want to see that what I'm saying is true, or simply try spending some.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:26:00
Exactly - this is why core chose not to increase the block size limit. Limited block space creates a fee market, to prevent spam. The network is only clogged right now because the miners are creating a bunch of spam transactions in order to raise the fees. The fee market is needed because without it the miners would have no reason to spam the chain, greatly reducing the amount of actual spam. Then the network would function correctly, but we wouldn't have any spam limit in place. It's all really quite logical.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:18:39
That's definitely true. The reason the latest drop was so extreme though was that many people simply lost faith in the new core developers and the new direction of the project.
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:40:01
Exactly, this is a first. If we follow the plan set out by the new core devs the fees will only get higher. This is by design. The plan is to use Bitcoin as a settlement layer and have regular transactions happen on lighting hubs instead. The Bitcoin chain itself will probably only be used by intermediaries where thousand dollar fees would probably be fine.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:50:03
This is currently the case with Bitcoin Cash - can you explain to me why that is since they don't have a fixed block size limit? Seems like no compromise was necessary there.
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:22:39

Sure, let's teach them poor security from day one. Alternatively, he could give them an uninitialized hardware wallet, have them initialize and securely store the seed, and then send the funds to a new wallet address that they generate themselves. This would go much further in introducing them to some of the concepts behind Bitcoin and the steps necessary to protecting their holdings.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:46:14

Roger Ver didn't create Bitcoin Cash and could fall off a cliff for all most of us care - this has nothing to do with one person. It's about the movement, it's about Bitcoin and the potential it held in the beginning. That potential is back now, but under a slightly new name.

Oh right, so that poor people in third world countries who can't afford bandwidth or storage can still run a full node. They won't be able to use the network since they can't afford the fees, but at least they'll be able to run a full node.

You would help a lot of more people and bolster Bitcoin adoption at the same time.

I just meant a blocksize limit increase of the original address format that almost everyone is still using.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:36:37
Yea, sort of seems like Bitcoin Cash would solve your problems. It works fine as a currency AND store of value. We're only going for a settlement layer here, not some sort of 'peer to peer cash' or whatever dumb idea you and satoshi had. Please stop trying to change the world - we're trying to enrich banks, not normies like you.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:52:13
It means even if the main chain dies of strangulation, we'll just keep using Bitcoin on another chain.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:07:06
Right on, keep fighting the good fight. We'll show these low value spammers that Bitcoin is only meant for banks and lighting hubs, not stupid regular people!
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:16:50
So just to recap the arguments presented:
* The block size is limited in order to create a fee market to prevent spam.
* Spam causes the fees to rise because of the limited block size.
* Miners are spamming the network to increase fees.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:08:38
I'm only one person, but for me personally I don't trust it because I question the motives of the devs who produced it. I'll stick with the legacy address format even if it means paying higher fees.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:41:19
I really hope this is the new officially sanctioned talking point in an effort to slowly move towards a block size limit increase. It's clear that the propaganda of the last year has been directed at limiting the network to prevent growth, but maybe the banks finally see that their grasp on the network is weakening, and they now need to appease the people at least to a small degree. Either way, we'll win. Whether it be through moving to a different chain, or supplanting the bought out devs. Welcome to the future, bankers.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:29:50
Specifically I would be worried that the new address and transaction formats were written to be exploitable. I know that certain groups and three letter agencies spend a lot of time and money creating security holes in common software and even open source projects to be exploited at a later date. There are minds much smarter than mine working towards these goals in almost all areas of technology so to think that they aren't also operating in the area of crypto would be naive. When I consider the actions of the new core devs who produced segwit (among other things) I do not feel confident enough to trust my funds with code they produced. Given the relative complexity of segwit in its current implementation I don't trust my own understanding of the code enough either.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:16:49
The cash chain will adopt lightning too as far as I know, it will just continue to work in the meantime as well.
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:43:02
I'm not sure what you're saying here - you don't believe the fees are that high? Try sending a transaction right now with more than a few inputs and see what fee you need. Pretty easy to test and anyone can verify for themselves.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:54:07

@_date: 2017-12-24 07:36:21
The new core developers don't want to increase the max block size and have stated that they want to maintain fee pressure on all transactions. This is a bit different than the old plan for Bitcoin which leaves some of us a bit confused. In any case, a lot of people in this community seem to support the new plan so I guess that's the way it will go. Those of us who preferred the original plan will probably find an alternate project that suits our use case of spendable currency a bit better.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:37:15
A lot of us used it fine for years, before the new core devs came along.
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:03:07

@_date: 2017-12-19 22:00:43
I've looked at the numbers, I'll still be fine. The block size limit fee market will price people out way quicker than the cost of full nodes will on Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:12:55
The devs working on the cash chain have stated that the limit will be variable, so I don't believe it will ever be a limiting factor.

Wong on both counts. Bitcoin Cash forked primarily to address the fee issue. Avoiding segwit was just an added benefit. Segwit is also not a hard requirement of lightning. If LN turns out to work, Bitcoin Cash will implement it as well (and/or other second layer solutions).

People mortgage houses today because our economy is debt based and uses an inflationary currency. If the world were to transition to a decentralized and deflationary currency (bitcoin), there would be no need for a mortgage as houses would be priced according to regular supply and demand, without the influence of cheap money (ie. fractional reserve, created out of thin air). Also with Bitcoin acting as a much better, more liquid store of value, house prices could come down closer to their real utility value, rather than the speculative investment they are viewed as today.

This is valid, though there are also real economic reasons why larger players in the fiat world might want to cripple an up and coming technology that could potentially cut in to their bottom line.

Perhaps you can offer some education so that people stop needlessly 'spamming' the network.
By the way, it's not Core devs doing it any more than it is the BU users - it's regular people, trying (and more lately failing) to use this so called 'electronic cash'.

So it sounds like you're saying that the primary investors in this case are big banks attempting to ensure their continued control over the financial system.. But that is exactly what everyone is worried about. Maybe we shouldn't let these people gain control over the primary Bitcoin development team, or better yet maybe we shouldn't have centralised development in the first place. "Disruption" is sort of what we're going for here, in case you didn't realise.

Maybe in the same way that I could pick up a tree branch off the ground and say 'This is gold now' and then continue to pick up more branches thus increasing the supply of what I now call gold.
Actual Bitcoin will never have any more than 21M, but that doesn't stop someone or some group from forking it and making their new coin have more. In fact that's exactly what litecoin did, for example.

Convert into Monero (xmr), or just buy Monero directly from an exchange. It has privacy at the protocol level. Convert back to Bitcoin and you've now got btc that's not tied to your identity.

How's that? BCH is an altcoin and BTC is Bitcoin. Bitcoin needs to scale on chain. Roger Ver is a wanker, and Core is a hostile takeover.

@_date: 2019-03-31 15:16:27
The reason you believe that inflation is good is because inflation is a mechanism of theft used to steal value and labor from you and the people in charge have almost absolute power in our society and can thus produce a significant enough amount of propaganda both through centralized media and political control to have you drinking the koolaid to the extent that you are. Really a deflationary economy would be better for the average person, worse for the 'gdp' which doesn't actually matter on an individual basis, and better for a sustainable life on this planet overall. It would also come with the added benefit of someone not stealing your wealth constantly by printing more currency and diluting yours.

I agree that we won't need fiat but we'll always need exchanges for digital assets. At some point most real world assets will be tokenized and we'll need some method for trustlessly buying and selling those different assets without a middle man. This will come in the form of decentralized exchanges using atomic swaps and similar technology.
@_date: 2016-11-13 23:15:57
This is already the case. Bitcoin is easily tracked (by govt at least), but once you've changed it into an anonymous coin there is no entity that can know your spending habits without you telling them. I think bitcoin works well for fiat exchange because of its liquidity and first mover advantage but once that's done the actual currency aspect might be better fulfilled by one of the alternate chains with built in privacy.
@_date: 2016-11-17 22:01:26
It's comparable to saying that we're all just going to up and leave digg and myspace, except that already happened. It's already happening in crypto too btw, though you won't hear about it here.
@_date: 2016-11-14 01:08:13
Conceptually it's all pseudonymous but in practice the vast majority of on-roads (ie. exchanges and payment processors) follow KYC compliance and track associations between addresses and individuals. As a result the government can maintain a very high level knowledge of where the money changes hands and who is using it. You're correct that you could move btc around between wallets that you create and they wouldn't know, but they would still know where it comes from and where it goes, which at the end of the day compromises the anonymity of the system. This isn't too much of an issue unless you care about the government tracking you and for those that do there are alternate coins that have privacy at the protocol level and can be easily changed for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:27:02
That's subjective I guess, which side of the fork do you consider the alt coin? The new chain or the legacy chain?

Yes, use shapeshift.io to convert to a more private coin for storage and use where possible. For routes back to fiat just change back to btc and sell on exchange. Keep in mind that the conversion each way will likely have some fees depending on who you use so this might not be a good approach if you need to be moving to and from fiat often (unless you're willing to pay for the privacy). Personally I just try to transact with whatever chain suits my needs as much as possible and not bother with the exchange back.

This would be true if human nature allowed the majority to think for themselves. Unfortunately this is not the case and the majority of people on this planet would rather follow a leader. As a result the world is run by a tiny minority of rulers and politicians and equally the Bitcoin network is controlled by a small subset of devs and thought leaders. It's the one failure of Nakamoto consensus and a fairly large one at that. Regardless I don't think it's a fatal flaw, it just slows the progress. Over time the truth always bubbles to the top and we do progress forward as a species. Eventually the miners and node operators will see that the chain has become too constrained and the limit will be increased or removed. Even if we sustain significant damage to Bitcoin in the short term it will all work itself out in the long run.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:37:12

@_date: 2019-06-07 15:50:00
This is true though arbitrarily limiting the transaction throughout doesn't allow the network to grow organically, it forces an ever increasing lower limit to the medium of exchange use case, putting more emphasis on store of value alone. I'm not necessarily making an argument against this but it is important to acknowledge that it isn't an organic result but rather a centrally planned change to the economics of the system.
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:12:36

@_date: 2019-06-07 17:17:50
The central planning I'm referring to was not Satoshis. When he originally implemented the block size limit he did so at a level much higher than demand for block space, and he also included pseudo code for how to raise the limit once block space became scarce. The change to the economics of the system came about much later, just in the last couple years. This is when the system started running up against the limit changing it from a simple spam prevention measure into an actual influence on the network and spawning the creation of an endless bidding war for fees which has no upper limit. The original spam prevention use case was perverted into creating high fees and unreliable confirmations, and this is what needs to be fixed by reverting to Satoshis original design of a limit set higher than demand.

    for (var i = 0; i &lt; passphrases.length; i++) {
      var decryptedKey = bip38.decrypt(encryptedKey, passphrases[i])
      var addressWiff = wif.encode(128, decryptedKey.privateKey, decryptedKey.compressed)
      var keyPair = bitcoin.ECPair.fromWIF(addressWiff)
      var address = keyPair.getAddress()
      if (address.startsWith('1124jx')) {
        console.log('Success: ' + address)
        break

    }
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:13:06
The single truly existential threat that I can see for Bitcoin is developer capture. Regardless of your feelings regarding the current core devs, the reality is that at some point in the future, governments or corporations will try to compromise the core developers (yes, all of them). If as a community we get in the habit of only accepting code changes from one group, we expose ourselves to this risk. I would be happy to run code written by one guy, any guy, as long as it had community review, and as long as we could move to code from some OTHER guy after. I don't want to be tied to any developer, or set of developers in perpetuity. I want the option for the community to choose new developers at a moments notice. It is the only defense against this type of attack. Without the precedent of being able to fire developers, we remain at real risk.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:50:36
One example of a serious threat would be if monied interests were to start paying developers and/or respected leaders in the community to sway public perception and downplay the importance of Bitcoin as a currency. They could even go so far as to manipulate the public discussion and alter consensus around the protocol itself through astroturfing and information control. This could also allow them to insert poison pills or other changes to the codebase which would undermine the security or economics of the network.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:33:10
The community still is, it's just not here anymore.
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:06:53
I am not interested in Bitcoin Cash because the economic majority has spoken and has deemed the legacy chain Bitcoin. Had the community gone the other way though I would have been happy with a non-segwit 8x chain as well.
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:19:13
I don't know how the fork will play out, but if I had to hope I would hope that without replay protection the upgraded chain quickly supplants the legacy chain giving us only one bitcoin with a value similar to what it is today (or maybe higher without the uncertainty of a looming fork).
@_date: 2019-12-12 22:42:52


I don't need a phd to understand that currency creation necessarily transfers value from the currency holders to the persons or entity creating the new currency. Do you disagree with that fact?


I didn't take a stance on volatility, and I don't really mind it personally. What I do mind is a system that is fundamentally designed to steal value away from honest hard working people without them even being aware of it. Bitcoin prevents this theft from occurring for anyone who uses it. It is understood that until Bitcoin becomes mainstream it will be highly volatile. That's a perfectly acceptable trade off to be an early adopter in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:32:16

@_date: 2017-11-01 16:34:18
I'm supporting the Segwit2x upgrade, but not as an attack. Most of us who support the upgrade do so only because we want what's best for Bitcoin. Should it be successfully accepted by the community, some of the benefits of this fork would be increased capacity, reduced fees, and further decentralization of development. I am biased only as a bitcoin holder, with no allegiance to any set of people, be them core, cash, miners, whoever. Just the opinion of one guy, though it definitely looks like the hashrate agrees with me, for now anyway.

Most of them were originally banned for promoting a higher transaction capacity on Bitcoin which would make it perform more similar to cash, like it used to. Only recently did they fork Bitcoin to restore it's original properties (low fees, fast transactions) in the form of Bitcoin Cash.

I live in Canada and have watched the price of everything relentlessly increase year after year for decades while life becomes harder and harder for the average person because our central bank keeps printing more and more money devaluing everyone's earnings. What's so amazing and insidious about it is that while everyone feels the effects of this almost nobody understands the mechanism behind it, and many who do have been completely brainwashed into thinking inflation is good and the theft of purchasing power is necessary. Bitcoin is a means for us normal people to secure our labour value and free ourselves from the greedy billionaires who are in control of the monetary system. Bitcoin is freedom, no matter where you live.

Why wouldn't the world agree? Other nations have no sway over US monetary sovereignty. The only negative would be that some poor people would essentially experience hyperinflation of any bills that they couldn't or wouldn't exchange, but it wouldn't affect the value of the newer and separate fedcoin. Seems pretty perfect from a central banking perspective actually, tons of labor value taken from almost every nation with no damage to the underlying currency.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:58:25

Since fiat currencies require trust a buyback would be extremely effective - the government would just put some hard date on it at which point the bills would no longer be considered legal tender and then everyone would be forced to exchange them lest they be left holding worthless plastic/paper.
@_date: 2019-04-06 05:58:40
There are a lot more high value users than there is available block space. Fees will not drop unless the block limit is increased. I hodl BTC but I spend it too, we need to cover both use cases if we're to escape the control of the banks.
@_date: 2019-04-02 22:37:24
Until we're able to garner enough support in the community for an increased block size limit we just have to put up with stuck transactions in times of high demand - usually the backlog clears in a few hours or days. We've never really gone beyond this level of transaction throughput though so as the next wave of user adoption comes I expect the fees will increase by a few more orders of magnitude. Hopefully we'll get lucky and some developer group will release a patched client that allows lower fees which will get majority support on the network.
@_date: 2019-04-03 01:50:20
It's totally up to miner consensus. I agree that there probably won't be a version of core with bigger blocks any time soon, but then the network doesn't need to run core. Any developer is free to release any client they want and it is up to the network whether we run it or not. It is incorrect to believe that Bitcoin is centralized around a single developer group.
@_date: 2019-04-05 16:20:56
If fees become too high for the average person to use then only institutions will run nodes. If you're comfortable with only institutional nodes, then you don't need to worry about bandwidth. Increasing the usability of the chain will increase the number of people who are interested in running a node and thus increase decentralization. If fees go up the chain will become more centralized.
@_date: 2019-04-10 21:50:58
A modern raspberry pi can handle blocks in the hundreds of megabytes today. Obviously we don't want blocks that big so using the pi as a metric for what the network can handle might not be the best plan.

Cryptocurrencies upgrade their chains all the time with little fanfare. The only reason Bitcoin hasn't yet is because it was the first chain and so many of the people in the community don't understand the process. The miners are already becoming more educated on the process and will be able to handle it on BTC soon as well. There is no reason in this day and age Bitcoin needs to remain limited only out of fear of a standard upgrade.

This is the disconnect - you're trying to use layman terms within a technical community where context matters. This would be akin to using the word 'theory' in a scientific setting to describe a hypothesis, which would be incorrect (though correct in common parlance). When talking about Bitcoin which is itself a monetary system, the context of the word inflation is in reference to the network properties, thus inflation == monetary inflation. If you were trying to describe these network properties to your family around the dinner table then it might make sense to preface the word and clarify the meaning, but within a technical Bitcoin community that clarification is unnecessary.
@_date: 2019-04-25 18:55:56
I used to believe this, that the network could simply move to an alternate client if necessary. Unfortunately over time I have come to understand that human nature is the true vulnerability, not code. The vast majority of the network (both miners and nodes) will do absolutely zero due diligence on the code they are running. If 99% of the network are running Core, then the network will run whatever software Core releases. Appeal to authority and herd mentality are much stronger human traits than I had originally imagined and it is clear that many changes have already been done to the network which would go against the common will. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised given that the vast majority of the human population live under systems of taxation, monetary inflation, and systematic legalized theft yet do nothing to stop it. It's disheartening nonetheless.

Lightning network is great and second layer solutions will offer true scaling however there would be virtually zero downside to a reasonable block size limit increase now to get us past the coming growth phase without having the network slow to a crawl like it did last time. I support a block size increase on the main chain. Long live Bitcoin.

Your ignorance lies in your belief that a fork of the client software (or reference implementation as you put it) is the same as a fork of the blockchain. We can easily fork to an alternate software implementation, be it a fork of core or otherwise, and that software can exist in any repository its developers prefer. Bitcoin is not tied to the particular Github repo from which it's releases currently come. If that were the case then whoever controlled that repo would control Bitcoin.

Since fiat money supply is uncapped all fiat currencies including USD will lose the majority of their value over time, just as the USD and other national currencies have done since their inception. Since Bitcoin is fixed in its supply more like gold or other scarce assets, it will gain value over time. It's simple supply and demand.

It's really not a complex problem, as is evident by how simple the solution is. The model is proven. Even if you think BCH is irrelevant, a million other coins have proven the model as well at this point. There is no reason to block an obvious and easy short term solution.
@_date: 2019-04-06 03:34:07
That's not my argument though, my argument is that if fees are too high only high value users will use it, but if that's the case and you've already excluded the low value users then it's no problem to raise the blocksize since the high value users can afford it. If you want to keep maximum decentralization and have low value users continue running nodes on their raspberry pi then you need to keep fees low enough for them to actually use the network.

The $50 fee metric is not just some talking point I'm parroting - I have first hand experience with many transactions during that time paying $50+ and even many of those didn't confirm until a number of blocks later. The fee market becomes unsustainable at times of high demand and transactions become extremely unreliable even with high fees. RBF will likely exacerbate this situation next time as users will be constantly bumping their fees higher to try and beat others to the next block. Fee spikes will definitely help spur adoption of Segwit however even with 100% Segwit usage we are still only talking a 2x transaction boost at the absolute most. This is not nearly sufficient to support the demands of 10x the users, which we will likely see during the next growth phase. I think you're probably accurate on your estimation of Lighting development but I also feel that the possibility is strong that we will see a growth phase within the next 6 months. The solution is a short term reasonable increase of block space to allow us to grow within reason while the remaining UX issues with Lighting are sorted out. Storage and bandwidth costs have come down considerably even just in the last few years so this can be done with zero impact to decentralization, in fact quite the opposite it will likely increase decentralization as more low value users will be able to use the network and will be incentivized to run their own node.

You're free to disagree but many of us do care specifically about the money supply and that's likely why the price is as high as it is.

In my mind the ideal state of development would be multiple competing full node clients each with a separate development team with no one client being used by a majority of the network. This would prevent developer capture and remove a single point of failure. As it stands there is essentially one reference client on the network (Core) and whoever controls that repo pretty much controls the network. Even if you agree with the direction the new Core devs have taken the project, you have to agree that no one party should have the ability to roll out unilateral changes to the entire network.

@_date: 2019-04-03 04:02:58
The difference between the science community and Bitcoin core is that the science community doesn't rely on a single GitHub account owner as the final word on what gets deployed. As long as Bitcoin only ever runs a client from the core GitHub repo it will be under the risk of centralized power. The solution is for the community (of either nodes or miners, your pick) to set the precedent for changing which reference client is run so that in the case that a single GitHub repo were compromised the entire network wouldn't be affected.
@_date: 2019-04-20 17:56:25
I think your confusion may be arising from an incorrect belief that inflation refers to the purchasing power of the currency which while correlated is not an actual measure of inflation. When people here talk about inflation they are talking about monetary inflation which refers to the underlying supply of a currency. In the case of USD the money supply can be increased at any time for any reason at the whim of a small cabal of bankers. With Bitcoin the money supply is fixed and grows at a known rate. It has a maximum cap of 21M bitcoin which will never be exceeded. The issuance of new bitcoin is defined by code in the protocol, not by humans.

@_date: 2019-04-28 22:36:08
This is actually a great statist argument for small blocks that I don't think I've ever seen anyone make - artificially constraining block size to create a fee market incentivizes users to consolidate coins and makes chain analysis a whole lot more effective. If you're interested in solving crime on the blockchain and deanonymizing its users, small blocks will definitely be very helpful in that regard. Criminals or people who seek privacy would be better served by a different chain where coin control is more practical for everyday use.

They probably just aren't counting segwit data, but it's not inaccurate. Either way, 1.25MB isn't really any better.
@_date: 2019-04-07 00:34:21
It's unsettling that the tiny recent spike caused fees to rise so rapidly. Makes one consider what will happen during the next hype / growth phase. Segwit bought us a 20% or so capacity increase but usually during growth phases our userbase grows by an order of magnitude. Since fees rose to around $50 per transaction during the last ATH, what happens when we breach $20k again, or $100k for that matter? Lighting may help us offload some pressure from the base chain but long term it won't be viable to stick with the same fixed block limit we've had for close to a decade, even with high Lighting usage. It's time for us to upgrade to a client on BTC which implements a higher block limit in keeping with modern hardware and bandwidth, while still allowing low value users to run full nodes.
@_date: 2019-04-03 02:32:50
Hardware has already become cheaper though. Since the last ATH we could safely 10x the transaction capacity today without increasing hardware costs.
@_date: 2019-04-07 15:50:22
So it sounds like you don't really use Bitcoin much at all then, sort of like the new Core devs oddly. Maybe you should leave the scaling discussion to those of us who have actually been using Bitcoin day to day for years.

That's fine, at $10 fees many lower income users such as those in Africa or Venezuela will be priced out of the network and no longer have any incentive to run a node. This will cost us decentralization and make the network less secure.
@_date: 2019-04-25 18:09:49
Whether you agree with the phrasing or not, the fact is there was a change of developers and the current developers are largely not the same as the original developers. With this change came a change in vision for the project.
As for the fees, I'm not suggesting that all transactions be 0 sat/byte, that's a strawman. I was simply stating that up until the blocks became full 0 sat/byte transactions were still able to go through. That's just a fact, not my opinion.

$50 fees were a reference to my own personal experience during that time, not a slanted talking point. Even in the $1-10 fee range though average users from outside the first world are already priced out of using the network all together. I have a number of acquaintances throughout western Africa who can no longer use Bitcoin at all as a result of the inconsistent and unreliable fee requirements. These are people who might hold $10-20 USD worth of crypto at any given time which may not be much for us but which represents a considerable investment for them. If fees can rise without warning to a level that would consume their entire holdings in a single transaction they are simply unable to participate at all. Most of them have moved to holding various altcoins, but that obviously isn't an ideal solution as altcoins have questionable economics and security. The only way to keep Bitcoin decentralized and in the hands of as many people as possible is to keep fees consistent and manageable, while still preventing spam. Even in the 3rd world the fee situation is a bigger issue to adoption than the cost of running a node *today*. As fees rise this problem will only grow and Bitcoin will centralize into the hands of fewer and higher value users.
@_date: 2019-04-22 00:06:04
Most of it simply boils down to theft. If someone else can print the currency you hold, it transfers value away from you and towards the person who prints it. In cases like Argentina or Venezuela the theft is greater than others, though the theft nonetheless exists in all fiat currencies. Bitcoin is different because it prevents that theft from occuring in the first place. When you hold Bitcoin your purchasing power may vary with the market, but no one group is granted the authority to steal from you through (monetary) inflation.
@_date: 2019-04-05 16:20:26
If fees become too high for the average person to use then only institutions will run nodes. If you're comfortable with only institutional nodes, then you don't need to worry about bandwidth. Increasing the usability of the chain will increase the number of people who are interested in running a node and thus increase decentralization. If fees go up the chain will become more centralized.
@_date: 2019-04-05 05:09:02
Why are we even still talking about this in 2019. Raise the limit already.

Your replies unfortunately betray a deep lack of understanding of how open source software and the Bitcoin network work.
@_date: 2019-04-05 16:39:41
That is also true, which is why the block size limit needs to be dynamic to prevent fees from rising out of control while also preventing blocks from becoming too big. The current fixed limit is already creating a situation where cascading fee increases price out users running nodes and increases centralization. Decentralization is important for the chain so to remain safe it is important that the limit increases before the fee pressure becomes too high.
@_date: 2019-04-03 16:46:47
Only needs 51% - Now that people have seen how larger blocks work in practice it will be a shoo-in.
@_date: 2019-04-26 05:24:33

@_date: 2019-04-03 01:56:16
This would be a good argument if the alternative to big blocks actually allowed the common joe to use Bitcoin. Unfortunately during the last growth phase onchain fees for a single transaction surpassed the cost of running a full node for a month. When the fee pressure prevents common joe from using Bitcoin at all, he certainly won't be running a full node.

To offer some perspective on bandwidth and storage, I just looked at the network tab of my chrome inspector and this one reddit thread we're currently viewing is around 6.6MB, equivalent to around an hour worth of full blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain. Unless the suggestion is that a majority of users are currently not able to load one single reddit post per hour, there seems to be a considerable amount of available room to grow before decentralization of nodes would be affected in any meaningful way.
@_date: 2019-04-03 20:24:37
I'm sorry but are you suggesting that the network would move to a previous version of the current client? No that's not how any of this works. In the case that the current github repo were destroyed or compromised the miners would simply run whatever new client emerged from whatever new repo or developer group gained consensus.
@_date: 2016-09-09 20:22:20

@_date: 2019-04-04 15:02:24
The high fees and additional complexity are new, Bitcoin didn't originally have either. Several years back the original developers got pushed out of the project and the new owners of the main repo for the reference client started pushing through a bunch of new complexity while also blocking a badly needed upgrade to the transaction capacity to force a fee market. I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader to guess what their motivations for this was, but that's where we are today. There are those of us who remember fondly the original Bitcoin which could be sent on chain for free with a guarantee of being included in the next block. It just worked. All is not lost now, since Bitcoin is a consensus network the client software can still be fixed but it will take the community of miners coming together to form consensus around an alternate client with developers who are willing to allow the chain to grow. Anyone can fork the client and propose a better version, and it's up to the network to decide which one to run. 
@_date: 2019-04-03 17:33:39
What you're implying is that whoever issues the signature controls Bitcoin and this is not correct. It is true that Bitcoin as historically used a single implementation though that implementation has also undergone ownership change in the past. Since the current owners of the repo are unlikely to cede control it is likely that the network will need to move to an alternate implementation at some point in the future, managed by alternate developers. This will be a good thing for the network as it will help maintain decentralization of development.

Usually when explaining Bitcoin for the first time I don't even talk about Bitcoin - I talk about the differences between money and currency, how currency is created via central banking and fractional reserve lending, and what specific properties sound money has that makes it valuable (scarcity, divisibility, fungibility, etc).
I'll usually follow up with an analogy: A game of monopoly with friends, where one person is printing new monopoly money for themselves and using it to buy up all the hard assets, houses, and hotels on the board. Even a young child can immediately see that this hypothetical game is rigged and the player printing currency is cheating, but for some reason many apparently intelligent adults can't see the same when scaled up to the size of our entire existing financial system. 
Once the fundamental groundwork is laid I spend the next 4-6 months breaking through layer upon layer of cognitive dissonance in the subject surrounding a misplaced trust in government and authority as well as a general naivety regarding monetary theory. If the subject is able, they will slowly begin to come to terms with the scale of the theft perpetrated against society, and only then will they be able to fully comprehend the potential of Bitcoin.
The final stage is to explain the technical and social mechanisms which enable Bitcoin to provide digital sound money. By this point the subject becomes aware that Bitcoin is not simply a means to gain wealth, or even an exciting new tech innovation. Instead, Bitcoin represents a global revolution that will topple centralized power structures of the past and restore freedom and personal sovereignty to the world.
It's a bit of a process if I'm honest.
@_date: 2019-04-07 01:28:40
I'll definitely concede that my $50 fee transactions were likely comprised of a number of inputs/outputs, but this is the reality for anyone using bitcoin as an actual currency. With standard long term daily use you will necessarily end up with many small value change addresses across wallets and and dust from old transactions. Even with a conscious effort to periodically consolidate balances it is still unusual to have a single input single output transaction. The other issue is one of reliability - while there are issues with fee estimation in general, in times of high demand if you want to be sure your transaction will be included in the next block or two you're sort of forced to overpay a bit, or risk having a payment processor or merchant refuse your order/purchase. Worse still if you're doing something like a cash deal on localbitcoins or similar you may need to wait with the other party for confirmations and you aren't able to leave until they happen. It isn't reasonable to be forced to wait around with a stranger for potentially hours or days for a confirmation, especially if you're already paying a high fee.

It is different because while BTC may be used to transact value between nefarious actors, it doesn't specifically enable violent acts on its own. If Bitcoin didn't exist, all of the same illicit items would be bought and sold in exactly the same way using a different medium of exchange. If fiat currency didn't exist however, modern war and the systematic oppression of billions of people would become impossible. Currency debasement directly enables large scale acts of violence and using cryptocurrency in lieu of fiat acts as a vote against that system. I feel a strong moral obligation to hold and spend Bitcoin to lessen my involvement in what I view to be an immoral system. If Bitcoin goes to the moon that will be a nice side effect, but it isn't a requisite for my involvement.

Factor in the rate of increase, not just the rate of issuance. Look at the long term chart. The end game of fiat currency is hyperinflation - the USD is in the early stages. Just because the last 10 years were the harshest ever in terms of monetary inflation (QE), doesn't mean it won't get worse from here. That bump up in currency production after 08' could be nothing compared to what's to come. I can easily imagine a not too distant future where 10x the amount of M1 exists. It is in that hypothetical future which BTC sees a 7 figure value.

If the original bet is 24k, I would give even odds and split the difference to find the midpoint between 2.4k and 24k, and whoever is closer wins. So if price is under 13.2k by that date I win, if price is over other party wins. The issue would be how to trustlessly execute a bet like this in fiat denomination, since obviously a bet in crypto means I lose either way.

Here's a simple example that will help you wrap your head around it, even without an economics degree. Imagine we're playing a game of monopoly, and I decide I'm going to fire up my printer and just start printing new monopoly money for myself. I then start buying up all the assets on the board and outbidding everyone for houses and hotels, thereby raising the prices of everything so you have no possibility of winning. Would you say that's a fair game? Would you mention anything if someone did that in a game of monopoly, or would you just keep your mouth shut and continue playing? My hunch is that virtually everyone would get angry and make the person with the printer stop, or just quit the game all together. It's surprising then that those very same people stay quiet when the exact same mechanism for cheating is applied to the real world, and they'll happily continue along and devote decades of their lives working for paper money all while the printers are still rolling.

Did you read my post? Once everyone pays back the $1000 they owe me, you still have your $100. Where did all of the extra money come from? Oh and there's interest on the loans.
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:48:01
Sure, let's use your example. Let's say I'm the bank and I start with no money. You deposit $100 and I now go lend out $90 of that to Sally. Sally now has $90 and owes me $90. She puts the $90 in the bank, and I immediately lend out $80 of it to Bob. Bob now owes me $80 and has $80. He puts his $80 in the bank and I immediately lend out $70 of it to Tim. So by now I am owed $240 from Sally, Bob and Tim, and you still have your original $100. The total money supply has gone from $100 to $340 with only a few deposits, and I'm not even done yet - I'll go on lending the same money over and over to new people until in the end I am owed 10x what the original money supply was. Where did all of the extra money come from?

My arguments are a) The fed printing free money *is* like cheating in monopoly and *does* steal purchasing power/value from any holders of the currency. Regardless of whether you believe the claims that they are helping the economy or not, it is theft. It is morally wrong. and b) The methods used to distribute the stolen money directly enriches the most evil element of society. This is also morally wrong.
They are two sides of the same argument, so I don't really care which one you focus on.
And here, I'll give you one more argument that also follows from the first: Even if we assume your premise that a stable, constantly devaluing currency results in economic growth (which I might agree with), that says nothing about whether economic growth is even a good thing in the first place. One could make a very strong argument that the biggest issues facing us as a species today, ie. earths failing biosphere, resource depletion, mass extinction, mass poverty and suffering, are almost all solely the result of our debt based consumer society, which is mostly the result of the system of constant economic growth you seem to subscribe to. So using that as an argument for why we should allow a small group of people to steal from us probably isn't going to change any minds.
@_date: 2018-04-06 23:23:56

3. War enriches the corporations who profit from war.

@_date: 2018-04-06 18:22:19
You are simply wrong, I'm not sure what else to say. In my original example if Bob, Sally and Tim all withdraw their money from my bank, they still owe me that money since I lent it to them in the first place. That would represent a bank run since I wouldn't have the money to give them, but that's how fractional reserve lending works. I only have a fraction of reserve on hand. Regardless of where they then placed that money though, I'm still owed $1k in aggregate. No matter what happens to them I will list $1k as an asset on my books. All of them will have matching liabilities on theirs. $1k of debt has been created out of thin air, even though the money to pay it doesn't actually exist within the system. It's essentially a ponzi scheme, though as long as new debt continues to be created it continues to work. Call it an accounting trick all you want but the reality is the money supply grows via this method. You can be pedantic and claim that the money supply doesn't really grow because M0 doesn't grow, but for all practical purposes the money that is actually being spent and transacted with in our economy includes the debt owed which is created through fractional reserve banking.

I think your mistake is assuming we care about inflation because of the effect it has on purchasing power alone. While that's obviously an issue, the bigger issue (for me) is that the people who print fiat currency use it for really evil shit and I have a big problem with my money being stolen from me and used to drop bombs on poor people on the other side of the planet who I've never even met. While Bitcoin may be inflationary for a while yet, I don't have the same moral issue with where that newly created money is going.

I was being facetious. In reality I have a 250Mbps connection with a 800GB monthly data cap. The point I was trying to make was that bitcoin should not be crippled for the purposes of catering to the lowest common denominator. There will always be people who are unable to run a full node for whatever reason, but they are unnecessary for the proper functioning of a larger block size bitcoin network. As long as the max block size is manageable for a decent percentage of the larger population, decentralization will be unaffected.
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:27:15
How is monopoly *not* like the real economy in this context? I guess one of the major differences would be that the fed doesn't buy properties. Instead they buy bonds, generally from the government, who then use that money to fund wars, invasions, and weapons manufacturing. Unfortunately all of that money then passes into the hands of the warmongers (generally private, for profit corporations), who *then* use it to buy up all the houses and hard assets.
So you're right, someone cheating at monopoly is a simplistic view of a much worse system.
@_date: 2018-04-06 23:02:03
Absolutely, holding fiat debt exposes you to some of the benefit of a devaluing dollar, since the real value of your debt shrinks with the falling value of the dollar it is denominated in. There's no question that the current economic system promotes debt over savings, and needless spending over fiscal responsibility. That's a big part of why most of the worlds natural systems are in a failing state, and why humanity might not last another 100 years in any meaningful capacity.

I used the system for 5 years straight before the fee market experiment started. Blocks were never full and fees were near zero. This is how the system was built initially and how it grew from nothing to tens and then hundreds of billions of dollars. I suppose you must be fairly new to the project if you think a fee market is the logic underpinning Bitcoin. Full blocks only became reality for the first time in 2017, and it is likely what led to the bleed off of value from Bitcoin into alts.

BCH was a completely unnecessary split.

I also think it's sad that a small group of previously unknown investors (not bitcoiners) were able to come into the scene, successfully direct roughly 75 million dollars towards the control of core development, and is now buying up other community projects to gain further control. Whether you agree with what that money is serving to accomplish or not is beside the point. The point is that with enough money you can simply 'buy' an open source project and pretty much do whatever you want with it. Everyone is for sale, and that's a sad statement about humanity.

That's what's referred to as a 'double spend'. You'll find reference to it in the post you replied to (but obviously didn't read).
In any case, this is basically how credit cards work (as described above). 0 confirmation transactions are the same as credit card transaction in that they cannot be trusted to be safe initially. The difference is that Bitcoin transactions are confirmed in a matter of minutes, rather than the months that it takes credit card payments. Maybe you weren't aware of that?
@_date: 2016-07-07 04:22:47
I accept credit cards, as well as bitcoin, and I can tell you with certainty that merchants are not reimbursed by Visa for chargebacks. Nor are we reimbursed for bitcoin double spends, though I have yet to see one of those in the wild. For my business and others like it, accepting 0 conf payment is perfectly acceptable, and the numbers prove it. You're unlikely to change my opinion on this as your arguments seem fairly baseless.
@_date: 2019-05-06 22:30:09
This seems like an argument for bigger blocks. Bitcoin never had a fee market until recently. The economic properties of sound money should be stable and not change rapidly - adding a fee market to a currency where none existed before is a disruption to the economics of the system, and a major one at that.

Individual users can no longer validate bitcoin today because they are unable to afford the fees. Literally nobody will run a node if they can't even use the network.

@_date: 2019-05-10 17:14:45
Let's take your argument to it's logical extreme - would a 1KB block size limit be good? If no, what is the ideal block size limit? More importantly, who sets that limit? Wouldn't a block size limit set by the market (nodes and miners) make more sense?
@_date: 2019-05-06 23:06:13
Bitcoins blocksize limit has always been far above regular usage, ever since Satoshi added the code. Only recently has the usage hit up against the limit and created an artificial constraint to throughput. This is a new change to Bitcoins economic properties which has never been tested. It is a change to Bitcoin which could be averted by simply setting the limit above usage, like Satoshi did originally.
@_date: 2019-05-09 16:16:33
Even though Bitcoin itself is decentralized, Core is a centralized group of developers with a single person in control of what gets committed. If you are one of the people who's code is committed then I think it is perfectly fine to refer to you as a 'core dev'.

Right, and credit cards work well and enjoy widespread use all across the world, even while accepting untrusted 0 conf transactions. It seems to me that maybe you don't fully understand business or the concept of shrinkage and acceptable loss.

@_date: 2019-05-10 17:21:51
Right, and whatever that safe and necessary size is, it sure isn't 1-2MB. So without resorting to central planning, the best way to arrive at that magic number is to let the network decide. By adding a user configurable block size limit and letting the actual people running nodes figure it out based on real usage it can fluctuate based on available resources and grow with technological advancements.

The fee market creates a perverse incentive to overpay, since people want their transactions confirmed. RBF adds to this, probably by design, by allowing people to increase their bid for their transaction to be included, creating a cascade of ever increasing bids. It is a system designed to fail.

The legacy payment systems seem to handle these situations ok - why not Bitcoin? If I top up my phone with my credit card the vendor doesn't see a confirmation or money in their account for at least a week, and I can double spend (chargeback) at any time up to 6 months later. Nevertheless, it seems like that system has been working ok. Is there a reason you can think of that this shouldn't work with Bitcoin as well in this case?

Individual users in many countries are already priced out of the network *today*. Not in some hypothetical future, but as we speak. Those users are certainly not running validating nodes, nor will they ever as long as a fee market exists. The damage from the fee market has already removed thousands of potential nodes, and it will only get worse as fee pressure rises. This hurts Bitcoins censorship resistance much more than slightly higher bandwidth requirements would. In addition, bandwidth costs become less each day, whereas costs in a fee market bidding war only increase with demand.

Nobody else has said it but realistically it's probably not a good idea to buy that little BTC because fees could eat up the entire amount when you go to spend it. I gave a friend $20 worth of BTC once and he wanted to spread the love and gave his friend $5 worth but the fees ate the remaining $15 almost entirely and his friend wasn't able to send the other $5 either. That was in a time of high demand but I'd bet that we'll see high demand again soon so you might end up shooting yourself in the foot.

Just shift in and out of Monero next time and save yourself the trouble.

Reasonable, low fees on each transaction. As the number of transactions rise, so do the fees collected by the miners - it doesn't mean each individual transaction needs to pay a higher fee though, only that there are more transactions - this is how the network would naturally grow anyway since more people would use it if it were useful. As it stands many people are already priced out of the network and unable to afford the fees, reducing the security of the network.

How so?

Artificially restricting the block size limit will price lower value users out of the network and reduce node count thus weakening security.

Please go lookup any bitcoin average fee graph you would like and take a look at what the average person is paying. Currently the average fee is $1.80 USD. The next block fee is estimated at $1.50. This is unusable as currency. There is exactly zero reason for this other than developer politics. That fee could be cut down by an order of 100 and the usage could rise to supply miners with the exact same fee reward. It is completely insane to promote a fee market in the face of these facts.

Go to coinmarketcap, click on Bitcoin, then click on markets, and look at the one that says 'derivitaves' next to it instead of 'spot'. Now compare the daily volume.

If you did so on a regular basis, yea.

Of course, but instead of limiting the blocks to an arbitrary limit fees can remain low and allow usage to grow instead, which would create more fees in aggregate. This was the original plan, the block size limit was only meant for spam, not to prevent legitimate transactions.

One of the best things the Core devs have done in blocking the stream of btc is to spawn the hydra of the alts. The next attempted bank take over will be much less effective as the community is now spread over a number of separate blockchains.

Just as long as everyone else doesn't get the same idea and trigger a cascade of ever increasing bids for block space, as is incentivized by design.

What's wrong with prepaid phones?

Some people who are new to Bitcoin and haven't read the whitepaper might think this is true.

A better analogy might be a picture of a standard mid range 3.5" hard drive from the day Bitcoin was created next to a picture of an almost identical mid range 3.5" hard drive from today, with 10x the capacity but the same cost. In fact, wouldn't it be weird if you went into a store and found a ten year old hard drive with a tiny capacity still being sold on the shelves today?
