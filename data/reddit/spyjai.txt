Yes, unfortunately. On retrospect I think there are several security issues that could've been prevented on my part:
1) Separate username, passwords and email for sensitive info (I had the same username and email for mtgox and btcguild)
2) Setup firewalls and renew IPs periodically
3) Setup good antivirus programs, spyware and malware removers
I've encrypted my wallet.dat and placed it on Dropbox, I thought I was safe. But the hacker probably just keylogged me so he has access to MtGox, where most of my funds are.. who would've thought! E-wallets are every bit as vulnerable as your personal wallet, and even more susceptible to attacks, as demonstrated here. Does anyone know whether browsing in private mode using browsers is deemed more safe? Because I still don't know for sure whether the attacker still has access to my computer and so on, it would be foolish for me to login just to have the account compromised again.

GUI Miner, the latest release. I've also downloaded phoenix miner and ufasoft miner separately.

I had different passwords for btcguild and mtgox. It was a combination of letters and numbers but it was less than 12 characters in length. I don't know whether my passwords were bruteforces (highly doubt it, since my email was also compromised). Thanks for the link, will check once I get home from work.

Aside from using Linux, what are some good security measures that one could use? Specifically, some recommendations of trustworthy antivirus programs would be appreciated.

Your post made me think about what the word "Chinese" implies. For a westerner, when someone says they are Chinese, the implication would be that the person is from China. But "Chinese" can be translated as 中國人 (someone from China), or 華人 (ethnically Chinese, i.e. people from SEA with Chinese heritage like Singapore / Malaysia).
When people ask me where I'm from, my first response is "I'm from Hong Kong". But I would also not deny that I'm Chinese. Actually HK is a part of China now so technically I was right in claiming that I'm Chinese from the get-go. I kept it simple in my post because that information is irrelevant.

You should never keep a substantial amount of BTC in an exchange if you're not day trading.

I already own a bit of bitcoins so I feel no need to beg for more. I'm sorry that my joke did not appeal to you.

Obviously this is just a joke - but just in case anyone does send btc to that address, proceeds will go to :P

Just because I don't post much doesn't mean I'm a noob. Check my post history, I got into bitcoins since 2011. I'm not asserting anything about China - I am reporting the FACT that this statement has been shown on the national television. My proof is that I can read Chinese. You can accuse me of trying to spread FUD but until you can prove what I translate is wrong, you're just spouting BS. Put up or shut up.

Just checked, it now has 0.001 btc. Thanks! Now let's just wait until we can gather enough to get a meal for :)

Yes, that's what I mean. For a westerner it means one thing only, but it is actually ambiguous. Being Chinese can mean both from China or ethnically Chinese. If someone asked me if I'm Chinese, I will say yes and clarify that I'm from HK. Maybe I should've clarified my original post, I just didn't thought it was relevant. This post will be buried anyway due to how reddit works. Oh well.

I'm in, thank you!

I'm from Hong Kong and I grew up overseas so my English is better than native Chinese people. I don't need to prove anything to you. You can get your friend to translate the screen cap. Feel free to come back to me if your friend says I'm wrong.
@_date: 2013-12-17 14:34:16
I concede that I don't normally introduce myself stating I'm Chinese - but the point here is that I know good enough Chinese and I'm sure I translated the screen cap correctly. FWIW the differences between traditional Chinese (written language used in HK) and simplified Chinese (the one used in China) are the way that the characters are written - which does not change the interpretation of the sentence as a whole (in most cases). Mistranslating something this simple is just not very likely.

Sorry, I was not aware of that post. I was more alluding to the possibility of neckbeards going out in full force to beg for bitcoins after the recent success of the guy showing his QR code on TV.

Allow me to introduce you to the Scandinavian countries.

I don't know, I would trust the state TV over a website.
