Could have gone the other way, just hang tight

Would love to know what you’re using instead, they done fucked me today

My coinbase account is compromised, how can I buy more today? I don’t want to wait 4 weeks to be verified on Gemini, I’m having some serious FOMO over here

Yeah .7 would crush my ass, hope someone reading this learns a lesson

I’ve been talking to him over the past hour, his mom and wife are also invested (on coinbase) as he was kicked off. But after I recommended (again) that he get a hardware wallet, tells me that he’s moving their coin to a broker in NYC, you wouldn’t happen to have an opinion on this would you?

No, they are a specific kind of Wall you find in jails. 
Jk, have no idea.

Damn, can I do that with ACH? I only have a debit card 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:16:43
Nope look at the bigger, 52 week picture
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:42:19
I tried telling him 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:31:27
Well thanks for the tip, they aren’t offering service in NYS

They unlinked my bank account for some reason today, cannot move anything, with the dip I’d like to buy, but spent two hours on hold before I gave up yesterday, I have a feeling it will be days before I get an answer (which is understandable) but nonetheless, fuck

In all fairness to Jaxx, it’s still unclear, but pointing to more of a theft rather than vulnerability. I’ll see him at work tomorrow and find out more, great question/point. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:01:58
I think he invested around 60k in total, but I’m guessing he’s probably out now. I doubt there’s any recourse. 
Also told him to check his stock acts etc, to make sure he’s not fully compromised. Don’t know what the likely hood of that is.

A friend of mine had 7 btc stolen/hacked from him on jaxx today. May not be just NS
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:24:01
I signed up, hopefully it doesn’t take two weeks to verify 
@_date: 2018-02-18 17:55:09
Was just on with no problems. I wasn’t on mobile though...

Have to agree with pepe, seems like you’re in it for the quick buck.  Nothing wrong with that, but your profits &lt; stability to a lot of us.

Since you are verified on coinbase, you can automatically sign up on gdax and do it there.
