I never said it was a startup already, did I? 
Besides, where are your numbers to support that argument? 
All I heard was someone trying to brag about knowing about a subject in particular. 
I suppose you must an engineer, hate to break it to you, but in the real world, engineers test out ideas for people like us, entrepreneurs who are willing to waste your time analyzing this kind of ideas. Be it by paying you or just asking for your opinions on different types of platforms.
So as much as I'd like to thank you for your remarks on the matter, I can only find your words toxic, leading to nowhere and to be unproductive. I'm downvoting you.

Yeah I just can't get it out of my head. Each time I get to surf the web about the subject I get more and more exited about it.
Funny I've been also spending some time thinking about the exact same subjects. Also on scalability and execution.

I'm guessing something around 10k worth of upfront investment for hardware only. Without considering operation and just based on a whim, I'm looking at 18 to 22 Months for ROI. It's not a bad bet considering I've still got another 18 years of running life for PV system. I might as well be better off mining other coins using solar power. But it does seem profitable in the long run.
