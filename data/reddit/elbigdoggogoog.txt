No it isn't.  Nobody is arguing that deflation will lead to people preferring to commit suicide to spending their cash.  It's just something you've invented because attacking it is so trivial.

It doesn't have to be spent, it has to be doing something productive otherwise it will lose value.  
But what I find really interesting is that you identify a problem, and arbitrarily decide that bitcoin is the solution.  What is the reasoning behind a deflationary currency being the solution to this "problem"?  And that is putting aside whether or not the "problem" really is a problem.  Why must *cash* be deflationary?  HODLing is even more degenerate than consumption.

Yep bitcoin could very well stick around and return stronger than ever.  It's just comical watching people trying to  rebrand their greed.

I like the way bitcoin nobodies try and paint their greed as not only logical, but *moral*!  As if being blinded by greed is righteous!  In fairness I was tempted myself to buy on the way up, long before it hit the ATH, but I didn't.  Why?  Because it was obviously a bubble.  My own greed tested me and I passed with flying colours.  Feels good man.

I mean you're projecting an entire lifestyle onto me based on the fact that I didn't buy bitcoin because I thought it was a bubble.  As if the fact I didn't buy bitcoin, which was in fact clearly the right choice, makes me a lesser person.


It is, it is.  However, I'm not going to start trying to time the market just to satisfy you.  I don't like throwing money away.

Nobody is claiming that people will sooner kill themselves than spend their bitcoin.  It's a textbook strawman.  Bravo.

It's crashing because the greed of the every day plebs created unsustainable growth.  You were happy when it was going to the moon and getting excited about exchanging it for fiat to buy lambos with (irony)..  and now it's on the way down "it's all about the tech".  Lol.
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:42:44


Is why.  We weren't  stupid enough to buy into the bitcoin bubble and we weren't  stupid enough to try and time the market either.  If you honestly didn't think it was a bubble when it went from $8k up to $16k (I forget exact numbers), in early December then you're an idiot.  I saw the headlines and I immediately messaged my friend on whatsapp to say "lol this bubble is crazy".  You're an idiot is all.  You got greedy and it blinded you.  It happens, but you are an idiot for still living in denial.

Rather that than a bag holder.  See you at $1k.

How old are you?  What a comically reductive approach to welfare, and consumption in general, you have.  There's plenty of consumption which can reasonably be considered "necessary".  Poor people in Europe are in general not given enough to have the luxury to buy too much stuff they "don't need" (which btw is kind of a stupid thing to say on ur part because everyone has different needs unless you're arguing for a society in which we literally only consume food and water, but I digress).


Yeah but *how*?  The solution to too much consumption is to encourage people to HODL?  Are you retarded?


It's about getting people to be productive with their money rather than HODLing, which is actually even more degenerate than the sort blind consumption that you're railing against.

Nobody should be buying bitcoin on credit anyway.  This is just protecting the idiots from themselves and the people with double digits IQ or above will carry on as usual.
