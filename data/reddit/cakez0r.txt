Gregory Maxwell (CTO, Blockstream) and Pieter Wuille (Infrastructure Tech Engineer, Blockstream and  contributor to bitcoin core wallet) asked for bech32.
Although I point this out with the full understanding that bitcoin core is an open source project and any developer contributions to it are a privilege and not a right.

Why would a for profit company do work that will not provide them with a profit?
Not to mention that Blockstream is also a for profit company. They could just put a bounty out of a pull request that implements it - I.E. use some of their assets to pay someone else to do it. Just a few months ago, [they raised $25,000,000 USD in venture capital]( Why not use some of it to further their goals?

I agree with pretty much everything you said. Gregory and Pieter have no obligation to implement bech32 into bitcoin core (although for what it's worth, [it looks like Pieter _has_ been championing that development work]( I brought it up to clarify:

If I understand, sending _to_ bech32 addresses doesn't save any money. Sending _from_ a bech32 address saves money. 
If that is correct, Kraken's actions make perfect sense as they've already done the dev work that is profitable to their business.

Another duct tape fix?

And you can also end up out of pocket when the buyer performs a chargeback. Any company that allows currency to be purchased with a reversible payment method will soon be out of business because of fraud.

Zynga was rumored to be looking in to gambling games to revive their business. Bitcoin payments could provide real value to their players if they could get around the regulatory hell that would surely come with it.
Imagine if people could deposit / withdraw (and play for) bitcoins on their massively popular Zynga Poker platform? Imagine if they made a slot machine emulator that you could dump satoshis in to (think [Coin Dozer]( Bitcoin could open up doors that allow them to make some really fun, highly monetizable games.

1. Fraudster obtains stolen cc details
2. Fraudster buys macbook for someone using stolen card and receives bitcoins.
3. Victim reports fraudulent transaction. 
4. Credit card company performs a chargeback.
5. Fraudster has cashed out the credit card for bitcoins. The macbook seller or the victim is out of pocket.

Presumeably this means that they've had coins stolen then. But how much....

It's never going to get any easier to change though. May as well bite the bullet as early as possible.

If bfx were so honest, they'd just release the Tether financial audits and put these worries to bed.
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:35:15
Because if Bitfinex becomes insolvent because they are operating as a fractional reserve via Tethers, you'll see a replay of what happened when mtgox went under.
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:24:25
The problem is that they refuse to release their audits and prove that they aren't doing exactly.

When you say under the influence, do you mean simply that 80+% of the hash power runs on Bitmain hardware, but that hardware is not necessarily owned by Bitmain?

As long as there are people willing to buy it, its price isn't 0. And as long as it still looks like BCH has a fighting chance, there will be people willing to buy it.

They're dumping it quickly because they expect the price to tank. They want to sell quickly to get the highest price before it becomes worthless.

They can only vote as a block if they control the hardware. I'm not sure it follows that they control the hashrate because they manufactured it. Seems a bit like saying Intel has huge control over bitcoin.
