It's useless because it doesn't do anything. In my view, owning property that you don't work or use for the purpose of renting it to labor in order to profit is an act of violence because the only way to enforce that claim when the owner is not around is to have the threat of violence. 
Therefore, capitalists are unable to adhere to the NAP. That's why it's useless.

You really don't see the actual existing material conditions in the world into which we are born as coercive? 
Does the vast majority of people have any choice but to sell their labor to owners of capital?

Approximately =/= equal. I can't speak for all socialists but in my view, pay could be vary between individuals who perform different sorts of labor. The kicker is that this would be determined democratically.

You're right. Any disagreement I'd have with that would just be pedantry about wording.

Like the sources of anarchist philosophy? I don't think calling a primary source biased is a good call.

If I can add: all communists are socialists. Not all socialists are communists. All marxists are communists. Not all communists/socialists are marxists.

Ok well instead of wikipedia and dictionary.com, maybe try reading any of the mountains of anarchist political philosophy that have been written on the subject and that created the idea of anarchism that capitalists are trying to co-opt.

Which I find to be very tragic. If we are discussing *need*, workers don't even need bosses (owners) like bosses need workers.

Anything to destabilize the current capitalist system is generally a step in the right direction.

Yeah, when starvation is the other choice, working for someone else isn't a voluntary decision.

No one should ask for critique of anything.

The NAP is just a useless thing in an argument. It serves no purpose in argumentation because it is subjective in nature.

That's probably because you're an ancap.
