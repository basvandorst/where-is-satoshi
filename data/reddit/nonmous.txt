Because we are still in the early stages. I am not necessarily saying that Greece's problems will directly cause a global crises, but rather that the problem (mal-investment and derivative/stock prices being over inflated) exists globally and thus once one major failure will trigger the collapse, even if it takes several years for this to be fully realized.
It's not just Greece (although they are certainly worse off), the European banks are in deep, deep trouble right now, and it is only a matter of time before the markets react as such.

I think you underestimate the potential for profit that Snapchat has. With that said, the stock market is and always has been over-inflated by cheap credit from the banks. It's a bubble.

You don't know? The government likes debt. And war. Debt and war.

Perhaps they don't just mean price-wise? Perhaps they mean in terms of adoption? It's not so unreasonable to assume that unstable financial institutions would lead to Bitcoin expanding and *probably* increasing in price. 
It's not so much blind faith in Bitcoin. It's much more so the understanding that central banks and controlled monetary institutions are having a major negative effect on the global economy, and this will likely lead to decentralized monetary systems growing and becoming more wide-spread. 
@_date: 2017-02-14 06:19:42
I think that people say that because Bitcoin pushes for monetary decentralization, something that Libertarians have been pushing for for decades (centuries, really). So naturally when Bitcoin came about the Libertarians got very excited over it, and I think that is why a lot of people tend to associate them together.

If Trump audits the Fed, passes a constitutional amendment for term limits, reduces regulation, repeals dodd-frank, changes our policy of regime change in Syria, would these not be good? I understand that Trump isn't going to be the holy savior, lol, but that doesn't mean he won't do *some* good things. We have to be the group that thinks critically about these things, especially in a time when nobody else is. 
@_date: 2017-02-02 23:24:03
Would you also tell this to people who invested in 2007? Obviously it depends on the circumstances (what they are invested in, how leveraged they are, etc), but often times the only reason these hedge funds are "safe and solid" is because the FED is fueling the hell out of the stock market with their cheap credit, and that would most definitely not be "safe and sound", although it would still be very profitable if you could play it right. 
Especially nowadays, with interest rates rising, I would hardly consider most hedge funds to be safe and sound. 
@_date: 2017-02-20 22:15:16
The economy only crashes because there is major mal-investment to begin with. Let it go on forever, and the consequences would be much worse. Besides, people tend to flea to 'safer' assets when it happens, and that very well could be Bitcoin since it functions as a digital gold equivalent (minus the ~4,000 years of history).
@_date: 2017-02-02 23:42:36
Depends on the hedge fund. Most hedge funds would take a pretty big hit over a loss that size. Not the ones that people talk about though, obviously. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 09:15:10
Who's to say it's not already?
@_date: 2017-02-21 09:34:28
Except it did? Are you referring to the last debt crisis or then new one (as the last one obviously goes along with my point)? Pay attention to the global economy over the next couple of year, this indeed will be seen as one of the first tumbling blocks in a global crises.

But the bets weren't on who would win the popular vote. And if that is the way these people are thinking, they really cannot afford to be betting their money in the first place. 
@_date: 2017-02-14 06:24:20
It would be par for the course. I am no fan of Trump, but at least we might see some free-market and beneficial financial reforms come from his administration, something that would *never* come from the left who loves cheap money.
Of course, there is an argument that Trump is just a liberal (in terms of economic policy) in disguise, which is most likely the case. 
If your getting guaranteed economic disaster either way, it's better to have the person who at least has a glint of doing something beneficial in the process.

So you are saying that mining would be profitable if nobody used Bitcoin? It seems you need to re-evaluate your thinking. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 23:44:25
I meant billions of people. lol. not billionares.
@_date: 2017-03-10 04:50:53
Right. My point is that Bitcoin absolutely is relevant to billions of people, even if they cannot use it as an every day currency. Same reason that gold is practical for those people; to escape capital controls and inflationary policy. Practicality is a whole nother' discussion. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 20:21:15
While I somewhat agree with you, having the market set the rate of inflation and having a central bank set the rate of inflation are two *very* different things. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 22:44:47
Would you agree that the most important thing is the integrity of the network and keeping it decentralized? Would you agree that all else comes second to that?

So what is it? Do miners make profits from people using Bitcoin or don't they? 
@_date: 2017-03-09 23:38:22
Relevant to anyone seeking to escape capital controls, which as it stands now could be billions.

Why should the public have more trust in banks (both central and private), than they do in themselves? Historically, this has not worked out well for them.
@_date: 2016-12-30 21:11:28
Sure, so there is convenience in the fact that the banking already has a solid user base (largely through government regulation anyways). But that is still no reason to say that the fiat system is any better than Bitcoin. If Bitcoin has the kind of user base that the big banks did, then it would be equally easy to use, and the cost of sending/receiving money would be significantly lower (overall). Not to mention inherently safer since nobody but you can gamble with your money and banks would have to have 1:1 reserve ratios (since fractional reserve is not possible with Bitcoin), unless they issue some kind of BTC backed fiat, which would be silly anyways. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 18:47:25
Part of the risk of accepting self ownership is that you accept the role of protecting your property. This doesn't mean that self ownership is bad or doesn't work, it's just the reality of a free people. There is no reason people couldn't take out insurance policies on their btc wallets, but these could never be guaranteed by a central bank or government if paid in btc which is the whole point. If a bank says they have funds, they damn well better have them, which is far from the case with the US dollar banking system.
@_date: 2016-12-23 10:25:04
But you are comfortable owning fiat that is centrally-controlled and is heavily inflationary? Bitcoin exists and many of its' users are attracted because it allows people to escape this, in a guaranteed way. 
At the end of the day volatility will be true of any 'currency' that is already not widely used, and that is not centrally inflationary. It is the price you must pay to have an actually secure currency, and it will get better as time goes on and adoption becomes more wide-spread. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 23:38:35
I mean, it certainly is true that people flee to more "secure" things like commodities when capital controls are increased or inflation is running high. I would say that that definitely has an affect on the price of btc. Obviously it is just one of many factors though. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 18:42:06
Utility in that they can "insure" bank accounts through expanding the money supply? Bitcoin was created to prevent that very thing.
@_date: 2016-12-30 18:36:33
How is this any different for fiat, though?
@_date: 2016-12-30 21:14:06
Yes, but as you say the biggest issue with Bitcoin on a personal basis is that you might lose you wallet, and thus your money. But ten minutes of time can completely solve this issue just by creating a backup for your wallet. Or if you insisted on cold storage you could lock that USB in a safe and be extra careful with it. Still significantly safer than the fiat system where 90% of your money is used on whatever whim the big banks have that day (and constant inflation is driving the value of your money down if you don't spend). 
@_date: 2016-12-23 10:21:01
It depends on what you consider currency to be. Believe it or not, there is a very large (and ever-growing) amount of people who do not believe that currencies should be centrally controlled and inflationary, and believe that the market should control inflation. Now this won't always be true of Bitcoin, but it is true of Bitcoin now, and Bitcoin serves as a store of value which was once considered critically necessary for something to be considered a currency. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 21:30:28
Sure it is. If you don't have possession of something, do you *really* own it? Banks in the US have a very low reserve requirement, a 1:10 ratio. This means that for every $100 you put into the bank, they are legally allowed to take $90 of that and loan it out to other entities. The only reason it is 'guaranteed' is because the government will print however much money the banks need to remain liquid and bail them out. But this process creates so much inflation that it will eventually lead to hyper-inflation if not checked or kept in balance in some way. 
Trust me, you do not own your US dollars that you put in your bank account. The banks do. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 10:16:29
Still doesn't mean that the IPO price isn't heavily overvalued. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 21:39:35
Possession is 9/10ths of the law. I know that legally someone who steals your stuff doesn't own it (except for the banks, because it absolutely is legal for them to do this). But at the end of the day if you cannot effectively safeguard your stuff and/or retrieve it when it goes missing then you might as well not be considered to own it.
