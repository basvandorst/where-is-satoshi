So since Cryptsy gets more and more bad news, I recommend to get out of cryptsy. 
Like, I dont get how Cryptsy still has around 500BTC volume everyday...
Anyway, how to get out of cryptsy:
If you have an withdrawal of any altcoin on cryptsy, get here:  and ask them to decline that withdraw (they most do this within a few days).
Then search any altcoin that can get out of cryptsy. DONT CHOOSE THE RED ONES: 
All the altcoins that work and you can withdraw: NET (more coins to follow from the comments I hope)
Just wait around 30 minutes and store ur altcoin in your OWN wallet ;)
I see NET as the best coin to get out yet, since it is really fast to get out and got a good volume and also available on other exchanges (bittrex, btcpool and cryptopia)
