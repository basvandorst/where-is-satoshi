You are more hopeful than I am. I think they will fight it, others who embrace it will profit in the long run, but in the short term a world war will break out before the current paradigm of central banks is made obsolete. There is too much power at stake and its been held for a very very very long time, it wont be a smooth transition.

It cost that much due to demand. You could pay $2 fee but wait last on the que line.. but thats not the end game, bitcoin is actively working on a major upgrade (Lightning Network) to address the current scaling issues (which lead to waits and high fees, it wasnt like that in the resent past). These issues are known, being addressed and are a symptom of its MASSIVE GLOBAL SUCCESS. 
Now, if the update doesnt work well or is delayed much longer.. then yes, serious competition will overtake it in time, but that is healthy, its a free market.
Bitcoin, even with its high fees and delays due to the system being overloaded with demand is *still* valuable. It might not worl well for coffee purchase today, but its the most secure and global storage of wealth which really matters to people in countries with suspect economies or corruption. The fees are also not bad compared to traditional services like Western Union.. but that is not the true answer, the answer is if the lightning network launches successfully, transfers will be close to instant and have minimal fees. Patience grasshopper.

If they are working for goverment, they really dont deserve the freedoms of a Liberatarian now do they? They choose to wield power over others, then with that power comes responsibility. A Liberatarian would just get rid of those positions altogether, and there would be no need to hold them accountable for market manipulation.

Now.. its being qualified as an asset because that is a strategy by central banks to contain it. They also dont understand the tech. Its also all still in early beta. Overtime, crypto will transition from its "gold" asset, speculative alt trading,  into 1.0 mature micro exchanges with mass market adoption (amazon, ebay, etc.. not just userbase) at which point one of two things will happen, or both.. the status quo adjusts their legal frame work to work with the dominant tech of the future (ie Japan) or they loose their shit and refuce to accept it and most likely get dragged into it reluctsntly kicking and screaming after the whole world already jumped in. Sadly, its the bigger economies like the eu and us that will likely drag their feet the most. War is more likely than open embracing it. Its going to be a rocky few years.. but expect big events, say russia and china trading oil in crytpo (even if state backed coins), mass adoption of decentralized exchanges, etc. Progress in the crypto realm will come from periphery economies, like Venezuela, Japan, etc who stand to gain more than to loose from crypto adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:20:47
Its gold. Decentralized, global, fixed supply, secure, opensource gold. That is what the market needs most, this is what btc is doing quite well.
Crypto cash moving as microtransactions will happen.. the coins will uodate tech and scale.. the developers will create rich ecosystems and in time, gov regulators will find harmony with it snd it will thrive.. but till then, micro transactions wont catch on. Especially in countries where they are taxed as securities. Growing pains.
Bitcoin is in beta! Curb your enthusiasm. Think long term.

If the they do ban it, (which i dont think they will, they are going to want the tax revenue), then its going to crash for a second, then rebound, the world doesnt care what one country does.. its adoption exists because it serves a need, that value won't disapear. The only thing banning it will do is impoverish everyone more than they might already be, while allowing other more progressive nations.. ehem Japan.. to become favulously wealthy. Early bird gets the worm. 
Unfortunetly, I think if its not banned, they will at minimum make it really really Really annoying to use. The us has the most to loose if it succeeds as it threatens the status of the dollar as a global reserve currency. My prediction is we will see major conflicts erupt before that happens.. hoping all things end peacefully and benefiting all parties.. gulp.

Youtuve "hillary lying" and honestly see how that makes you  feel. her dishonesty under oath and the whole way she handled the server fiasco, every single one of her peers in goverment would have faced harsh consequences for the same actions. She used her political clout to get past it. And where is the Clinton foundation now  that she lost? Did she refund the massive contributions from the Saudis? Wink wink. She will say and do whatever is convenient to her and who she represents (aka not the vast majority of americans). The numnuts who chanted slogans for trump are idiots, but dont let her off the hook because the other side of the false dichotomy are as abhorent. she is a awwwwwffffffull. Awwwwwwwfuuuuulll.

Actually its using hydro a lot and being used in places with excess energy. Furthermore if you consider what its an alternative to (banks with massive buildings, constant AC, heating, lighting, data servers, people commuting back and forth, etc) its actually not that much of an issue. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:34:02
Dummy, it was slow from massive demand, its not slow now. Its also evolving tech in its infancy, scaling solutions are being developed. 
As for power usage, its still waaaay less than what banks use (all the offices, commuting costs of employes, etc) and that power usage is what givea btc a) its security, which is pretty important and b) its what backs it, you cant just print up btc without costs, that stabilizes it.
You could make the arguement that btc is heading down the wrong technological path (is btc vs bth) but to dismiss it outright as "old tech".. lol
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:13:27
Thats because of its success. It got swamped by insane growth.. same as ethe did. Its the focus of attack from everyone, central banks, other alts, wall st shorting it, scammers, etc.. its the bull leading the stampede.

If you invested your life saving at 20k you where obviously not paying attention to the actual long term development. That price was a mob rush from speculators and the main stream media pumping.. everyone trying to get in not understanding and expecting a lambo. 
If however you have been paying attention, and been steadily investing, your returns would still very much be in the positive even at todays "low price". BTC is far outperforming stocks and USD as far as retaining its value, you need to look at it wholelistically.
I understand its difficult if you are in the red now from investing at an all time high, but if you got in as a long term buy, believing in the technology, rhen you hold, and if things continue amywhere remoyely close to the past 9 years, you will be happy you bought at 20k. The market is highly volatile because its still very very early, its a small marketcap, much smaller than other regular assets like Gold, things will stabilize once we are more mature, both jn term of people rushing in, and tech, and regulatory adjustments, and the size of the network buffers things. But you knew this gettint in, no? You knew it was a wild rollercoaster of volatility, right? This is not new.

Until the currency goes into hyperinflation. I have lived this before. A pack of gum will cost $1000 USD. 
The only thing preventing this is that currently, the whole planet is doing the same, deficit spending on fiat and trading pegged to the dollar. When it pops, its going to be a global recession the likes we have never seen. Delusional momentum. Its a game of hot potato, where the potato is a nuclear grenade.
Its either gonna crash, or we will enter another world war to prevent it, or they will try to antisipate it by trying to issue a global currency.. but Crypto might beat them to it.

Bitcoin is the most tested and secure of the top coins. People at times of economoc strife give zero fucks about crypto kitties, they care their life savings stay safe, like gold, when economies go into hyper inflation, etc. Thats where BTC shines, and as far as I see it, that is the only actual value the international community with money to invest today cares about. Everyone else, is speculating.. speculating eth will be the backbone of some yet to be valuable apps, of some token tech for banks, etc, etc.. but when shit hits the fan, no one will care about anything other than their money being safe. The world trusts btc.

Gold and silver have intrinsic value and are anti inflationary. It takes energy to mine them.
BTC is virtual, but it does take energy to mine it. Its anti inflationary and its backed by the computational difficulty of factoring extremely large prime numbers, aka math, aka encryption. 
The dollar, since the 70s, is fiat, aka backed by no intrinsic value, it takes (almost) no energy to "mine" it, thus its an inflationary currency. This works if the goverment remains small and efficient and the amount in circulation stays reasonably capped. The goverment is massive, its spending is massive, the decades of wars and the crony bank bailouts via quantatative easing did nothing to help, and both Dems and Reps use defecit spending like a credit card in the trillions.. it gets worse every year. Even if somehow we can keep the rest of the world trusting its value without forcing a world war, even if we can keep inflating it and keep making bond I owe yous without it going tits up.. its at the debt of our children and our childrens children.
Turning and turning, the center cannot hold..

Take a line from rhe beggining of BTC (years ago), follow that line all the way to the present and you will clearly see a steady, continuous growth upward incline.. up until a few months ago, where the hype machine caught on, and you have a drastic speculative pump upwards, and its consequent reset back to the original, steady growth tragectory.. which puts it right around the price we are seeing now. 
Yes its a bubble, but only that crazy spike. The rest of it is sound.. hella more sound than the stock market is now, which is a bubble, a massive one that has yet to pop.

Gold and Silver are both metals with actual use.. electronics, jewelry, etc. They do have intrinsic value, granted they are more valuable today since they have liquidity as coinage, but even if something like Bitcoin made Gold "obsolete" it would loose some value, but it would never drop to zero. Elements in the periodic table will always have some value in proportion to their quantity on earth.  
Meanwhile, a hyper inflated fiat currency can easily go from $1, to $100, to $1000 for a piece of bread over the course of a few years. It happens all the time. I grew up with it (Argentina), and you can see Venezuela is having a nice dance with it right now. Once it takes a million dollars a month to pay rent, its essentially worth zero, at which point central banks usually try to start a "new" fiat currency under a different name and the process repeats. When it resets, dont expect to have anywhere near the savings you did before the hyperinflation kicked in. The banks get rushed on, things grind to a halt.
BTC (and other limited quantity, proof of work, crypto based blockchains) wont need 50 years. If successful, arguably already, in 5 to 10 years they will have matured. This is software, it moves much quicker than traditional assets. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:06:54
Ethe is awesome, but its not a secure for storage of funds, its network also maxed out at the same time as btc did and it has as likely a chance of beinf made obsolete by an alt as any other.. more so I believe, things like EOS etc are much mich faster today, if ethe doesnt improve its speed, it will be left behind.. same aa btc.. but atleast btc, even with high fees (not now) and slow transactions (not now) is still functional gold.
