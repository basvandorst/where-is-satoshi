Which is quite a high percentage given the shitload of shitcoins. Taking only the top 50 coins into account would show a btc dominance of about 80%...

Mcafee can start chopping. Give the sausage some time to mature in taste and shrink a bit.

Ebay does seem to have gift cards: 
Are Ebay gift cards a shallow pool because Amazon is much bigger?

Do you have a link to the source, good sir?

On the other hand: the number of wallets, transactions and hashing power are growing steadily. Banks are investigating blockchain tech while not so long ago they were bashing it. And mainstream media uses a much more positive tone when reporting on Bitcoin. May I remind you that not more than a year ago Bloomberg described bitcoin as unicorn money.

I am an enduser. I have wallets and I transact. Hashing power is maybe not directly linked to endusers. But indirectly, the endusers make it worth the miners' time and resources to generate this kind of hashing power.

I know diddly squat, but I know that when btc dumps it can also dump pretty hard. Could it be that btc hab been dumped too hard and it's catching up now?

How do you rhyme you being a hodler with your previous statement that bitcoin is dead.

Unfortunately I know of at least one case in my environment. If somebody decides to commit crypto hari kiri by going full retard into these excuses of forks that's ok. But this fucker tries to take with him as many as he can by selling it as if it is the best thing ever. And he targets vulnerable newbes. Whenever I notice this I try to debunk his crap, but there is only so much I can do. I just hope this toxic crap dissolves into nothingness asap.

Dear fellow Binancians,
Binance has completed the system maintenance ahead of the estimated time, and we will resume all trading activities at 2019/06/07 22:15  (UTC).
From now until the commencement of trading, users will be able to cancel orders, process deposits and withdrawals, and use all other account-related functions.
This maintenance is due to a disk failure issue, which is fixed without data loss.
Thanks for your patience and support!

You sound like you were rekt by selling too early.

Gigameg blocks anyone?
@_date: 2019-02-20 19:34:40
It is definitely possible. I had it running before moving. It takes a lot of time to synch the first time, but it runs well once done. Have a look at:

Sorry guys, only had my first coffee today.

Thanks for the information. Really appreciated!

Does this mean you get more bang for your buck with the new model? The price difference looks a bit hefty...
@_date: 2018-07-11 21:30:45
This is probably a scam: 
Please be careful folks.

Was waiting for the guy behind retarded Sherman to show the 'Buy Bitcoin' sign. A bit disappointed :)

You act like there is something like a long term chart that can be used as a crystal ball. We could be going to 5k, hell we could be heading to 1k.  We could also be heading to new aths. Nobody knows....

He might be referring to the number of Bitcoin forks.
@_date: 2019-05-25 17:13:58
Then maybe you should increase the sats per byte to an acceptable point.

Looks like the Binance app.
