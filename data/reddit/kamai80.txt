Let me make it clear!
Who says Bitcoin is dead is also saying gold is dead!
Can you pay with gold? Si claro. But would you? Only If you had to. 
So Stop thinking Bitcoin will ever be a currency. It is going to replace 1/4 of the gold reserves.
What that means? 1 Bitcoin is going to be something around 250 000 Dollar. 
Bitcoin is here to stay. But not as a currency rather the digital gold! 
To be honest i dont give a fuck If you hodl or Shit. To me all the "hodlers" sound like some stupid assholes.
What i am trying to tell you here is, If you want you can sell. There is nothing wrong with it. Anytime soon when you are liquid again you can buy and invest in the digital gold.
So stay relaxed and ACT like a man. Make your choice Brothers and Sisters.

I tell you guys something. By the end of the year this shit will be around 18000 dollar. 
And now enjoy Life

I also think that the whole Blockchain shit is Just a Hype. It is just a fucking database. Bitcoin will be the digital gold. Al others are going to die or will transform into tech start ups with or wothout value. In a couple of years nobody will talk about Blockchain i think. But ethereum and bitcoin will survive. And MAYBE some other coins with real use value.

OK Guys now listen!

Regarding to smart Contracts i am with you. And the whole Blockchain is imo pure shit nobody needs BUUUUT i promise you that one day in near Future bitcoin will replace gold. There comes a time maybe in Couple years where you pay 250 000 $ for 1 Bitcoin. Silly? Nah. Really makes sense. Whats so Special on gold? Naugh! It blinks but people invest in gold to save Money. Economy goes with time. Things change and Bitcoin is the gold of Future. Morgen
