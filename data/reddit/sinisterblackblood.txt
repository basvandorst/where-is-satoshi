Can you take a selfie for us?
@_date: 2014-12-24 19:25:57
You care what other people think?
@_date: 2014-12-02 19:21:21
Thats awesome.
@_date: 2014-11-22 20:53:20
That's a good question. It's already happening today.
@_date: 2014-12-27 00:10:49
I can't imagine this thread is going to go well.
@_date: 2014-12-27 00:31:01
I've never seen him. Do you have a pic?
@_date: 2014-11-14 21:12:17
I like and approve. 
There should be an easy way to explain and demo using a Bitcoin transaction.

Whatever you do, please don't give them a Changetip when they behead someone!
Convince them that one Satoshi is worth one  worth one infidel.
/yes I'm an idiot

If you give it to me, I'll sell it for Bitcoin and then use those proceeds to tip it to others and keep the circle going!
Have fun!

I'll start by saying it's not that I'm a huge fan of Bitcoin myself. I try to remain emotionally removed from such things.
But I do see a pattern of large companies, very influential billionaires, and the tech industry getting behind that.
I'm learning that the public does not what it wants. They must be told what they want. Bitcoin and the Blockchain technology is going to revolutionize the world within the next 3 years.
Whether you believe in it or not.
It doesnt matter if you find every flaw in the world about it. Your opinion doesn't matter. It's the people I referenced above that will integrate it into society using their influence.
So, like I said. It's not that I care. I can just see that is is THE INTERNET OF MONEY.
...and I want to be on board before the train leaves the station and I get left behind.

Terribly written article.
Here are good examples of explaining Bitcoin to the curious.
@_date: 2014-11-22 07:15:24
What's this all about?
@_date: 2014-12-02 21:49:21
Just ask him what he knows about Bitcoin. Dont try to have an agenda, just share what you know. You might learn something too.
/Thats my advice
@_date: 2014-12-02 21:59:46
Thanks Dude/tte!

I'm not sure if they have a Meetup.com version in Canada, but I would try to find others there.
I'm going to try to go to a Bitcoin gathering on Monday myself.
Good luck

I feel like this is lacking enough details.
@_date: 2015-01-12 17:52:01
In the first sentence of the article the author already is incorrect about Bitcoin being a virtual currency.
@_date: 2015-01-12 20:32:02
Even if it's wrong? That doesn't make any sense. 
This only helps perpetuate incorrect information. Lord know we already have enough of that.
@_date: 2015-01-12 20:42:07
Interesting how you admit it's wrong and yet still defend it.
/very curious indeed!
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:46:45
So what happened?
@_date: 2015-01-07 13:35:09
It doesn't say shady at all. It was a smart move. Better nothing than trying to make something up.
@_date: 2015-01-12 21:26:23
Exactly flohlie!
