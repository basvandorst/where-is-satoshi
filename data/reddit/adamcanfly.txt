I'm starting to think that it jumps on Fridays (payday)

Nice! Hopefully it catches on!

Yeah. It’s hard to resist the urge to sell when it’s high. It’s also hard to resist buying more when it’s high. I’ve been reminding myself to just buy the dips. I’m in it until central currency is over.

Someone posted a DCA calculator on this subreddit yesterday.
Edit: Found it!

The other day, I was talking to someone who has a friend in the oil industry. He said that his friend is now selling excess natural gas (which is normally burned off) to bitcoin miners. 
This is from Wikipedia:
“When petroleum crude oil is extracted and produced from oil wells, raw natural gas associated with the oil is brought to the surface as well. Especially in areas of the world lacking pipelines and other gas transportation infrastructure, vast amounts of such associated gas are commonly flared as waste or unusable gas.”
I’m thinking you could get a comex container full of mining GPUs and park it right next to an oil well. You could then use the excess natural gas to run a generator to power your GPUs.

I was watching the price when it first launched this morning. I kept checking here for the roller coaster meme. ������

I understand what you're saying about BTC being more energy efficient, but I have no idea how that will happen.   
I was replying more to this statement "It's not like places with cheaper electricity are dumping all their energy in huge fucking flywheels or wasting it just for fun."   
They may not be using huge fucking flywheels, but they do use gas flares. Check out this satellite image of the Eagle Ford shale gas flares.

All of that natural gas is being burned off because it's not expensive enough to build a pipeline or truck it. Is burning it off like that better for then environment than running it through a generator? I don't know, but I doubt it's worse. You can park a small BTC mining unit next to an oil well and buy that natural gas at a discounted price. The owner of the oil well doesn't have to install equipment to burn the gas off and actually makes a little money from it. It's a win win.

Give this video a watch! They’re using stranded natural gas at oil wells to mine bitcoin. Running pipelines from every oil well would be expensive, so they burn off the natural gas byproduct. If you fly over oil fields at night, you will see gas flares as far as you can see.

Don't worry! There will always be more dips!

One little dip and concern trolls come out of the woodwork.
