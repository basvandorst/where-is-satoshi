idk price checkpoints seem to be easier to focus on. Yea basically we keep catching up to the hype mark each year and then spend the remainder in recovery and recursive self improvement. Market correcting until we create a new "hype" point. You can say 36% a year, or 4.6%/trimonthly, still better than the 0.1%/m you'll get from putting it in your savings to just sit there.

Word from the wise, there is money in holding other people's money, it creates value, and when the value of the early investors gets sold to the new investors as profit then you find yourself in a literal ponzi scheme. Moral of the story? Don't invest in Altcoins that are hosted by ICO's who reap a profit the same way banks do. Crypto, true crypto is opensource

That's what concerns me, I was trying to consolidate some old shitcoins that I had and couldn't find a legit exchange that supports them anymore. Went from "this will be the future" to shit now I can't do anything with it. But I think if they did that it would just end in greater retaliation and everyone switching over to Tor networks and deepnet exchanges. Life will always find a way, as long as there are computers, networks and electricity the revolution will go on.

$9k is the new lower plateau, it will never go bellow it, the whales won't let it. You can sleep sound knowing your money is secure. Like how XRP forces every wallet to hold 20.0, there are thousands of wallets out there holding Millions.

anytime there is a $3-4k increase, expect a drop for a few weeks until it reaches the lower plateau it started off at. Wait a few months and that $4k increase will become the new norm and the whole process starts over again.

Maybe within the week, it will go back up to $14k, then on to $15-$17k- then back down to $14k and everyone is going to freak out again, but then slowly start climbing up and establishing a new lower plateau. That's just how it is.

@_date: 2019-06-19 19:44:54
I have some paperwallets I made that are 3-4 years old. They do not show up in the blockchain as a valid address unless I transfer money to them. So I would say as long as it has a balance it is considered active. Which I kept a balance on one of them for a few  years just to make sure the system would still let me restore the private key at a later date. Bitcoin is great, banks would have charged me some kind of fee by now or closed my account entirely without notification.

no like gold has value because it is used for computer chips, jewelry, fillings, aerospace...etc it's extremely pliable and dense enough that you can take a pin head amount and stretch it out 20 feet. But what applications does have 1.56249 BTC have? that kind of thing I can see transfers at this point in time contributing to the network and being good for expansion but until we find a use for the balance associated with a public address other than to just use it as a fancy way to move money around it is not scarce, there is no demand.

If you have a private key you can import it from "Cold Storage" to fund your Mycelium wallet, then send it to whatever account you like from there.

Besides our economy is no longer gold standard, it is the petrodollar now. We know how many bitcoins there will be, no idea how much oil the planet has. As much as I don't like him Vitalik Buterin does make one valid point and that is the true potential of crypto and the applications for their algorithms has yet to be discovered. Right now it is just money but give it a decade and it will be some next level stuff and that is what we all need to work towards finding and creating.

Bitcoin is saving the world because it frees us from financial slavery. Instead of borrowing money via a loan which you later can't pay off so you file bankruptcy, it starts off in the negative and goes up. By doing this you can acquire it at any point and are guaranteed to see gains the longer you hodl. It's a clever reverse debt program where instead of the banks robbing you through interest the community quietly puts money (value) back into your wallet while you sleep.
@_date: 2019-04-17 12:26:22
That makes complete sense, but where as rare Pokemon card's value is based on what the collectors see it as, Bitcoin's value is based on it's ability to be an international currency globally recognized. Cards aren't designed to be a form of currency, but in a parallel universe they are. At the end of the day you still have to have some form of government accepted tender to trade for Bitcoin, and then you would later be reversing that trade when you need to pay your bills. It ends up just being a bunch of extra steps to accomplish something that, like you said, one of those apps could do. However, we are not using crypto to its full potential yet, we are still learning what all we can do with it. Crypto, IMO, isn't meant for every day small world transactions. It is meant to solve the problems of big banking transfer errors and outrageous interest rates or loans. It is a way to invest in something long term you know will pay out instead giving your money to someone else to invest in 410k for you and hope it does well while they go and play golf with it. One day, long from now, things will level out with this world. You will be able to go into a grocery store and walk out with food without ever swiping a card or handing out cash because you are part of a membership program that gets auto-deducted from your wallet yearly. The current corruption of nickle and diming every little thing will go away and the quality of living will be much better for everyone.

As much as I love crypto, I hate how anytime I watch a video about it, it is about 15 minutes of people talking technological mumbles to get you lost but because you don't want to feel stupid you just nod and agree, and then at some point there's about 5 minutes of talking about how much value is in the network and community aka meaning how much people are holding instead of putting it in a savings account or something. There is a silver lining here but no one is truly an expert and you shouldn't listen to anyone trying to tell you how it is, it is just something you have to educate yourself on enough to decide whether or not you want to invest.

“The quickest way to double your money is to fold it in half and put it in your back pocket." ~ Will Rogers.

William Gibson and call it cyberspace, people are spending more and more time connected emotionally and interactively with their friends and colleagues through the internet. Virtual worlds such as Second Life and Blue Mars create 3-dimensional habitats, have their own currency, and their own constitutions (aka "Terms and Conditions"). Flatter worlds such as Facebook (aka Social Media) encourages groups of like-minded people around the world to work together for the common good—as defined by the particular group. Like the ocean, virtual nations will have a growing impact, and may result in very real, separate national identities.
