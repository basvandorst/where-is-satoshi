What part of my post was made up?
@_date: 2017-01-01 19:32:12
Nonsense. None of these people know anything about the price in the future.

I bet Jack is happy you're posting his name and private messages with him here.

C'mon man. We had 15 of these posts 30 mins ago. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 00:38:57
What am i supposed to see here that proves me wrong?
@_date: 2017-01-01 22:37:55
There is no true demand in any of those countries you listed. Especially India and Venezuela. The "demand" there isn't enough to move the price a single dollar. 
The price is going up because of traders and people buying into a hype. If this stops we could be back at 700 in no time. 
Let's hope it continues and no exchange gets hacked. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 23:38:10
Do you have any proof of that?
@_date: 2017-01-01 18:37:19
Pure speculation. 
So far all i see is traders trading. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 18:55:19
Racist?? What?
Show me where or i'll report you. 
Oh you quickly edited your post. 
Islamophobe? Really? A phobia is an irrational fear. Ask the victims of islamic attacks what they think of that.

It can also go down. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 22:44:45
Indeed. Every 15 mins someone asks us to look into the future. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 23:41:03
And why would that be happening now suddenly?

You think 6 people posting this before you wasn't enough?
@_date: 2017-01-02 16:05:15
So how much are you buying at these prices?
@_date: 2017-01-01 23:45:19
Yes, and?
@_date: 2017-01-01 21:33:32
Haha don't be ridiculous. 
The ath is next. Then 1500, then 2000. And then many more price points.

Nobody knows. Because we can't look into the future.

You have no idea if he will be good for sure or if the price will increase. Stop giving new people false advice. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 14:09:59
I use tons of wallets. Doesn't mean anything. 
Me personally, i have never met a Bitcoin user in the 4 years i've been using it. Which is pretty crazy. 
I gave all my friends and even strangers on the net quite some coins over the years though but i don't think any of them turned into an actual Bitcoin user. There simply is no need for them to use it. Which goes for 99% of the world. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 00:01:10

@_date: 2017-01-02 16:02:27
How much are you buying?
@_date: 2017-01-02 11:26:54

@_date: 2017-01-01 19:06:16
@_date: 2017-01-02 11:18:52
Because he is holding 2 coins and wants to get rich. So he needs new people like you to buy in. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 14:03:12
Realist news eh?
@_date: 2017-01-02 15:58:27
I'd say we can't look into the future.

Ok. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 17:54:01
Jesus Christ. The 6th 1000 post while we haven't hit 1000 yet. 
Annoying kids. 
What's the point? Pretend we are at 1000 while we're at 990?
@_date: 2017-01-01 22:43:31
Yes. Of course it could. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 23:46:58
How is this proof that people are buying Bitcoin because of that?
@_date: 2017-01-02 11:20:26
Congrats on having your own shitpost. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 13:00:03
Stop pretending you can look into the future. You have no idea what the price will do next year. We could be at 500. Nobody knows. 
Every single year people made claims how Bitcoin would explode next year because reasons and every single year they were wrong. 
Yet you people keep doing it. And not once did i see a post from that person a year later saying sorry i was wrong, i hope noone followed my advice and lost money. And neither will you. All you people just quietly dissapear. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 14:16:12

@_date: 2017-01-01 23:40:17
The Bitcoin economy in Venezuela and India is extremely tiny. Nowhere near enough to move the price like this. 
There is not a single piece of evidence that the "war on cash" is causing this price rise. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 11:29:21
Nobody knows because we can't look into the future. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 18:37:57
Yes we know. 10 people before you posted it already.

I remember this sub in 2013 during the peak. Post after telling people to buy buy buy! Pump pump pump! This rally was just starting! You would become rich! Just buy!
You know how many came back and apologized for their behavior after we crashed back to 200 and tons of people lost crazy amounts of money? 0. 
1 thing these people had in common was that they had already bought in at lower prices. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 19:31:17
People buying. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 16:24:04

You can use this example for literally everything!

Nobody knows. Because we can't look into the future. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 22:42:28
No, it isn't clear because there is no guarantee whatsoever that the price will keep rising. You just want him to buy so your coins will be worth more. People like you make this seem like a ponzi. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 11:27:39
A gamble would be a better word as nobody knows where the price will go. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 11:28:44
Funny. You're the first honest person i see here. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 11:16:30

Technically yes. But it's kinda silly to be like hahaha darknet markets! How silly of you! And then not being able to find a single thing people spend more coins on. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 22:52:57
Notice the word safe in safety?
Bitcoin is unsafe. That's the opposite of safe. It's highly unsafe and a horrible safety hedge. One exchange hacked, one blog post claiming Satoshi is found can crash the price by 100's of dollars. 
Stop with this crazy logic! Bitcoin is not safe. It simply is not!

Did you take out a loan? I mean that would be the easiest money ever? How much did you buy today?
@_date: 2016-12-27 19:49:45
Look, saying Bitcoin is high risk, high reward is perfectly fine. Saying Bitcoin is a great investment if you want to avoid inflation (which you did) is just silly. It's a highly dangerous investment and not some kind of safety hedge. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 18:17:50

You have some serious issues my friend.

How can you say this? Bitcoin is highly unstable. You have no idea what the price will be in 3 months from now. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 22:13:28
Do you have any sense of reality at all?
Here's a tip to get it back. Ask 10 random people if they want to be paid in Bitcoin. Obviously they will say no but then pretend they say yes and ask them how they will achieve this. 
Please report back here so i can laugh.

Ridiculous argument. Stop pretending every single business out there depends on exactly those 3% for their profit just so you can say: see? Bitcooooin!!!!
@_date: 2016-12-27 12:06:57
So far it's only a very small group getting rich. 
For the majority of the moon kids here to get rich the price needs to go way higher. 
And no, they wouldn't be able to handle it. But who cares. 
@_date: 2016-12-26 11:20:57
 The volume is Venezuela and India is absolutely tiny so those countries for sure aren't causing a price rise. 
And China, well i can't find any evidence for any kind of mass adoption or real big buying volume. What we do know is that there is a lot of trading going on and these traders seem to be responsible for the current price swings. Mind you, the Chinese exchanges are feeless so you're seeing a lot of "fake" trades. A bot can trade 1000 coins with itself all day long and make the volume look huge. 
It's hard to tell. But user adoption in those countries isn't the reason. That's for sure. 
The people making those claims is the result of weeks of clickbait articles posted here every single day about how Bitcoin is exploooooding in the country of the day. They're all bullshit articles looking for free traffic. And of course they all get upvoted to the top. 
So when this crap gets repeated long enough the majority here will simply consider it a fact and repeat it on Twitter and other social media. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 08:37:12
It's so little you can safely consider it zero. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 17:04:20
Can you give me a few good reasons why you expect Indians to adopt Bitcoin?
Because personally i don't get this "financial trouble? Mass adopt Bitcoin now" thing many people have here. I actually think it's kinda crazy how many here expect millions or even billions of people to just start using an extremely unstable hard to use internet currency i stead of fiat. It's a really unreasonable thing to expect.

@_date: 2016-12-26 11:07:13
Long term the price depends on user adoption. Short term it's traders. The huge price swings you see are caused by traders. Exchanges follow each other. Right now the west follows China because of the massive (fake) volume there. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 20:03:02

Absolutely nothing happened in Greece itself. What did happen though is hype. Because Greece was supposedly mass adopting Bitcoin people elsewhere got hyped and started pumping the price.

You seem to have a really, really hard time giving me a simple answer. Could it be because you know your anser will be bullshit but you will never ever admit it so you just completely avoid it?
Could that be the reason?

Finally someone with some common sense. Thanks. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 23:51:08


It's just weird how you confirm what i am saying and at the same time keep repeating your nonsense. 
Read that sentence again and realize how crazy it is that you call that a safety hedge! Not one serious investor in the real world would call that a safety hedge! Not one! 
You know why? Because it isn't! As your own sentence clearly explains. 
The only people who would call this a safety hedge is young people in a Bitcoin sub who own a few coins and have zero investing experience in the real world. And something tells me i just very accurately described you. 
I honestly can't believe why you keep this nonsense up. 
Call it a risky investment, a gamble, high risk high reward, all good. Just stop calling it a safety hedge. It's the leadt safe investment i can think of! It's the exact opposite of a safety hedge. 
Use some common sense. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 15:13:05
Huh? Can you give me a reason why it should?
How much are you buying today? Nothing?
But you are expecting others to buy?

He is not wrong for suspecting a drug purchase. It's a top use case for Bitcoin. Millions and millions go on there. The darknet markets are huge.

Who are these people? What % of people want this?
I never heard of such a thing. Of course there will be a few techies here and there who want to be paid in Bitcoin but the very vast majority of the world doesn't. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 19:54:45
It's safe to say nobody knows if we will. We could hit it in the next hour. 
Mif you want it to 1000 then start buying. Or do you only expect others to buy while you count your money? If that's the case then don't complain. 
If you wouldn't buy at these levels why would you expect anybody else to?
Edit: i'd love to know who keeps downvoting every single post i make. And why.

I'm not sure what you are trying to say. Surely not that Bitcoin will take over fiat. So what is it?
@_date: 2016-12-30 23:16:16
Yes, it's completely retarded. But they'll introduce Bitcoin to many new people. This will only make it grow. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 19:47:08
Yes, in theory. And nobody will know if that will actually happen. So i'm still not sure what this has to do with Bitcoin as it isn't some kind of magical currency that can't go down. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 21:00:59
Many do. Like me last month as i posted earlier.

@_date: 2016-12-27 15:42:57
Yeah i too think he is trolling. I'm ignoring him. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 10:59:01
That's ridiculous. And near impossible. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 23:57:47
It's absolutely crazy how in your completely delusional mind i somehow am against Bitcoin, hate Bitcoin, because i simply refuse to join the circle jerk. 
Nowhere, not one fucking post, did i type anything that could suggest i'm anti-bitcoin. And why would i? I own shitloads of coins! I started buying at 20 bucks! I spent more coins over the years than you will ever own. Fuck, i gave away more coins than you will ever own. 
I too benefit highly from the price going up. Yet i don't act like a fucking moon kid with 2 coins about it. I prefer to be rational about the price. 
You and others here are harassing, downvoting, stalking and reporting me because i like to talk about the flaws Bitcoin has. Yes, that's right. Bitcoin has problems. You hate me because i think that the price might go down again. 
And you just can't handle it that i mention those problems or say the price can go down which translates in your brain into that i somehow hate Bitcoin. 
People like you only allow "this is good for Bitcoin" posts. Anything else must be a shill, a troll. 
You're a fucking moron. Get off my nuts and grow the fuck up. Try to handle a discussion where someone has a different view on things than you. Idiot!
@_date: 2016-12-28 13:55:53
I hope we don't bounce off 7000. If the Chinese cross that number we could be at $1000 soon. 
Then next stop ATH. Probably some panic dumps here and there. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 13:36:10
Please stop upvoting this site. They post sensationalist clickbait shit every day. 
These people have nothing to do with Bitcoin. They just create ridiculous "this is good for Bitcoin" articles and watch the moon kids upvote it and give them free traffic. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 15:20:36
So why aren't you buying like crazy then? Go to the bank, take out a huge loan and pump the price. You'll be rich!
@_date: 2016-12-27 13:24:46
And doesn't make any sense whatsoever. You're still paying with fiat. And you gave three middlemen some money in the process. C'mon stop advising this. It's insane. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 21:25:40
Why are you getting so defensive right away?
@_date: 2016-12-25 11:03:21
Yeah, hold on, let me figure that all out for you. Brb.  
@_date: 2016-12-25 21:30:45
So when are you gonna buy back at a loss?
@_date: 2016-12-30 19:40:46
Stop making such a fool of yourself. It's cringey to watch. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 18:28:53
Of course it is! Again, work on your reading because i never denied that or anything similar! Hell, i myself use it for other things. Why would i deny that???
You're making up stuff while reading my posts. No idea why. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 10:16:50
Once i get it. Until that time he has my money. And if anything is risky at the moment it's the Bitcoin industry. Nothing but fraud, hacks and companies dissapearing. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 06:23:07
So just like every single other year? Surprising. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 09:40:14
Traders trading. Like it's always been. Sometimes they push the price up sometimes down. 
Now they are shorting. They don't care about things like adoption, capital control and all the stuff we have to read about here daily. They care about making money with their trades. Up and down. And they control which way it goes. 
If mass adoption was really happening no trader was able to stop it. The price wouldn't go down anymore. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 07:57:26
Damn, you're naive. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 23:49:56
Are you implying that if they continue to ignore Bitcoin everybody will start using Bitcoin and stop using dollars and banks completely?
@_date: 2016-12-27 13:37:21
Yes. But i get it. Legit to you means i'm getting my stuff. No matter how many people are using stolen cc's. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 18:56:09
Yes. Trading. 
Which again is absolutely nothing. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 12:18:22
You have no idea where Bitcoin will be in a couple of years. Stop giving new people false advise. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 07:20:56
Because that's how investing works. You didn't realize that?
@_date: 2016-12-30 20:24:02


Yes, that's why i'm using one for most purchases instead of Bitcoin. But thanks for confirming it again. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 19:58:47
Did you read his post at all?
@_date: 2016-12-31 00:13:00
It might be different this time but it's always the same when a new company is gonna launch. "This will take Bitcoin to the moon!".
I've seen this hype so, just so many times over the years and so far it always ends up not doing anything. We then forget about it and move on the next "this is huge" thing. 
I hope it's different this time but i doubt it. We'll see. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 13:18:26
Let me repeat my question:
Are you suggesting people should use fiat to buy bitcoins then use those coins to put fiat on a credit card again? Meanwhile paying everyone some fees. 
No, i'm not clicking your link. You can stop posting it.
@_date: 2016-12-27 18:36:34
You will lose your money. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 17:36:24
Which would be?
@_date: 2016-12-25 07:14:58
This goes for literally everything with a limited supply. 
So according to your logic you just buy something with a limited supply and wait for others to jump in and you will be rich. 
Well, you know, there is a possibility others won't jump in. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 23:07:24
The problem is Bitcoin's volatility. India is a poor country. Most people can't risk crazy price swings. Also to use 5 to 15 cents fee per tx may not seem like much but if you expect poor Indians to pay that with every transaction then you will be dissapointed. Not gonna happen. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 18:38:01
What defense tactic???
@_date: 2016-12-30 17:16:25
And no answer. Totally didn't see that coming. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 16:51:59


Kinda crazy how you completely ignore Bitcoin could go down as well. And has done so many times. Often faster than any inflation of any currency. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 23:54:44
Man, i wish a country would actually adopt Bitcoin for a week so we can see how absolutely horrible this would play out and can stop this nonsense about whole countries moving to Bitcoin. 
No, Bitcoin is not the best option for Zimbabwe. Far from. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 18:33:56
Pro tip: don't make crazy posts how Bitcoin is gonna replace all fiat and shut down governments. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 23:00:54


Because tons of businesses don't pass on the fees to their customers. C'mon, why let me even let me explain that. 
Anyway, it doesn't matter. Bitcoin will not suddenly make everything 3% cheaper. 
Stop the fear peddling. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 19:42:54
"No problem, everybody will just refund you, it's that simple!"
In the meantime this sub is filled with posts from Bitcoiners who lost their coins. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 09:41:52
@_date: 2016-12-27 11:09:04
Yes, you are also this sub's biggest batshit crazy cultist. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 01:04:57
Ok, fair enough. But still, why is this posted here? 
@_date: 2016-12-30 20:07:13
Exactly. This is a non-issue nowadays. 
And that's why i use Bitcoin for small stuff but would never use it for anything serious. If the seller doesn't deliver then it's SFYL. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 14:16:17


We were talking about Bitcoin uses. 
Can you give me some examples of where Bitcoin is used more than on darknet markets. Your reaction makes it look that what i'm saying is ridiculous. So i'm really curious to learn where more coins are being spent. 
Edit: who keeps downvoting me? Why??
@_date: 2016-12-25 10:14:00
If you know when to sell you sold at 900. It was clear the price was struggling there. Right now is a really bad time to sell. It could easily go up again from here on. You never sell during a crash. You sell at the start or you're too late. 
You shouldn't give advise when you yourself don't even understand the very basics of investing. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 12:10:32
I'm pretty sure someone with an older account can confirm how crazy that guy is. Anyway, you don't have to trust me. 
I trust noone here. No matter their account age. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 13:39:28
Apart ftom the fiat on the card of course. Which got there by buying bitcoins and have them changed to fiat again. 
But whatever you want dude. Enjoy your little fantasy world. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 19:20:35
Ok. Sorry i upset you so much. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 15:49:26
Sure there are people doing it. Absolutely not denying it. 
Coming to Reddit and telling everybody to do it and it's really easy is just crazy. Even more so when he starts suggesting buying Bitcoin and putting it on a fiat card again. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 20:23:07
Wth are you talking about?
@_date: 2016-12-26 21:57:15
Wrong place to ask. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 10:53:50
Holy shit. 
Dude just get out and never do that again. You clearly have no idea what you're doing. Take your loss and move on. Everything you will do from now on will make it worse. 
People like you buy at the top and sell at the bottom. Always. 
Also nobody here can tell you what the price will do. We can't look into the future. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 14:49:23
Calm down. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 09:47:35
Bitcoin transactions are public. Literally everyone can see your transactions.  It's a really bad tool to hide anything. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 15:27:18
Yes and people in areas without technology. Just no way. 
@_date: 2016-12-26 08:42:35
Haha yeah. Thanks. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 19:43:40
Stop trying to scream over the internet. Just stop. It will only annoy people who would otherwise help you.
@_date: 2016-12-30 13:34:17
Jesus Christ. People are seriously downvoting me for giving a prediction in a contest thread? This sub is insane. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 13:16:30
Yes? And? I've done 26 successful orders with my coke dealer. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 17:01:13
He simply ignores that fact and pretends he's spending Bitcoin. It's absolutely crazy to watch. 
And i'm being called a troll for thinking it's ridiculous. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 13:31:52
Holy shit, that's a lot of speculation presented as facts. 
Edit: downvoted because??
@_date: 2016-12-28 07:32:35
Where do you think these massive discounts come from?
@_date: 2016-12-28 18:58:18
I'm talking about the clickbait shit. No country is gonna adopt Bitcoin in 2017. 
Even if they wanted to it wouldn't be possible. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 12:20:22
You have no idea if it's gonna climb hard. If you did you would be at your bank right now taking out a huge loan. But you aren't. You just want others to buy. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 13:38:01
If you have believe to this sub Bitcoin is huuuuuge in China and they are buying like crazy. 
Fact is nobody uses it except for a few traders as speculation. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 21:56:22
Aaah right. Didn't realize this! Thanks for explaining! I must be such a dumbass!
@_date: 2016-12-25 13:39:55
What's completely made up?
@_date: 2016-12-30 01:08:05
Well, what do you think Bitcoin holders in a Bitcoin sub think? 
You might want to ask in a place more neutral. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 08:51:46
Oh great. Reminds me of 2014 and 15 where this sub spammed company after company that they really needed to accept Bitcoin. And when they finally did nobody spent their coins because you're supposed to "hodl" (top post at this moment) and a year later they dropped it again. 
And here comes the best part. Every time a company dropped it a new spam brigade was started here to threaten that company telling them they really needed to put Bitcoin back up or nobody would buy anything there anymore and everyone will start buying at the competition. 
Resulting in that company making sure they never touch Bitcoin again. 
And with this airbnb thing things won't go differently. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 22:05:06
Peddling fear? Seriously??
@_date: 2016-12-25 16:36:18
You mean people "hodling". 
Oh great. So bitcoin's best use case is people not spending it waiting to get rich. Ok, noted. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 16:57:58
Correct. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 20:50:51
Yup. And i'm glad it is. Just like every consumer out there. 
Buyer protection is a beautiful thing. 
Edit: those who instantly downvote me, why? What is a reason to downvote? Buyer protection is not a good thing? Is that it?
@_date: 2016-12-25 13:45:34
Do you always do that? Switching the subject with every post?
You don't make any sense.  
@_date: 2016-12-25 16:06:51
Jesus Christ, we go up a few dollars and the shitposting starts again. At least wait till we hit 920 please. We were here just 2 days ago. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 22:35:47
It's because of all the bs in this thread. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 16:16:46


This image has been posted 100's of times over the years and always someone will explain is where we are. And it's always somewhere different. I think i've seen 3 different "we are here posts" in a single day once. 
@_date: 2016-12-26 08:53:51
No. At this point the Indian Bitcoin market is absolutely tiny. Extremely tiny. I sure hope it becomes huge but you have no idea if it will. Let's wait and see before you make these claims. Right now nothing points at it becoming "huge" anytime soon. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 17:57:21
Man, the volumes especially in Venezuela and India are so ridiculously low it's hardly worth even mentioning it. 1 day of darknet usage is probably the same as what those countries are doing in a month or more. 
China? What are the Chinese using Bitcoin for? As far as i know they use it for nothing but trading. 
Can you show me 1 product that people buy more than drugs with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-12-29 12:38:42
Are you the one downvoting all my posts?
@_date: 2016-12-28 17:53:44
Brazilians gooooooooing crazy about Bitcoin!!!!!1!
Checks localbitcoin volume: 16000 dollar a day. (17 coins a day in a country with 200 million people)
Conclusion: Brazilians are not going crazy about Bitcoin. Like completely totally not. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 20:00:28
Ok, i hate calling people a troll but you clearly are trolling me now. Ignored. 
Pretending Bitcoiners don't get scammed all the time. That must be the craziest thing i've read all week. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 09:51:02
Who would want that?
I like it when my money is reversible. Just last month i did a chargeback on a product that didn't deliver and the seller didn't respond. 
And that's why i only use Bitcoin for a few things. And 9 out of 10 times i will pull my cc instead. 
And i'm pretty sure most people think like me. 
Consumer protection is a huge feature. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 11:18:10
1: because the rest of the world is already is using quicker and easier payment options that also have consumer protection and no fees. 
2: because -again- people don't spend their coins. They "hodl". 
@_date: 2016-12-27 13:03:16
Are you suggesting people should use fiat to buy bitcoins then use those coins to put fiat on a credit card again? What?
Edit: i own a Bitwala card and i sometimes put money on it. But i bought lots of coins very early on in 2013. For me it makes sense. But for someone who doesn't own coins that would be ridiculous. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 09:54:01
Right. 
And tomorrow mass adoption in third world countries and fleeing capital controls in China continues again.
Or you know, maybe just maybe, it's simply traders trading. 
It's funny how you think everyone is now celebrating Christmas in China by the way with 1% actually being Christian. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 16:16:59
People only hate the 1% if they are on the wrong side of it. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 14:20:22
True. More like a correction. We went up too fast. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 00:56:03
Nobody knows. You need to make your own decisions. Believe it or not but nobody here can see into the future. 
Any answer you'll get is just people guessing and will be worthless as investment advise. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 11:08:01
No it's not practical. That is complete bullshit. No matter how much you are into Bitcoin. Living on Bitcoin, especially in those countries, is nowhere near practical. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 19:32:32
I'm sure this will convince the rest of the world to start using Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 19:34:49
Why would anyone go through that when they simply can use their cc?
@_date: 2016-12-25 21:52:47
Absolutely. Never be too sure about anything. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 15:17:21
that's ridiculous. So for every purchase i first need to look for an escrow service and then set that up with the buyer?
No thanks. Again i'll rather use my card. Why go the difficult way if i can go the easy way?
@_date: 2016-12-25 10:57:18
Where do i pretend i know the outcome??
@_date: 2016-12-25 10:30:06
Yes, gambling is another good case for crypto currencies. 
Uh thanks for the downvotes?? I take it back then? Gambling is not a good case! Crypto currencies suck for gambling!!
That better??
@_date: 2016-12-29 08:36:10
You should guess less and stick to facts more. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 11:48:14
How do i not understand Bitcoin exactly?
@_date: 2016-12-25 10:06:28
Especially when buying Bitcoin i'd want buyer protection. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 00:18:40
Did you even consider the fact that Bitcoin can go down as well?
@_date: 2016-12-27 12:30:00
Yes it is for most people. Highly impractical and depending on your location even impossible. This is a fact. No amount of anecdotes from die hard Bitcoiners in a Bitcoin sub will convince me otherwise. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 22:03:09
What does that even mean?
@_date: 2016-12-30 08:39:48
How much did you buy? Oh, nothing of course.
@_date: 2016-12-25 23:10:00
Can you just tell me what you are trying to say in 1 clear sentence so we can avoid the next 5 posts of playing word games? Thanks. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 18:00:25
Surprising. But keep attacking me, for a reason i can't even figure out. 
Why does it upset you so much that darknet markets are bitcoin's top product? It's doing exactly what Bitcoin was made for. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 22:01:29
@_date: 2016-12-31 00:49:58
Way too many Steam games. Waaaay too many. 
The process is actually too quick and easy. I just keep buying. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 17:03:22
Why would they? Why would they switch from one volatile and unstable currency to the next one? While paying fees and middlemen everywhere?
Bitcoin has some great uses but not for these people! It will just make their life more complicated!
@_date: 2016-12-25 11:10:15
Jesus Christ. Calm down. Did i really upset you that much?
@_date: 2016-12-25 15:26:18
The first number i believe. But i highly doubt 24% knows what Bitcoin is. Has to be way less. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 08:39:53
Maybe post some less sensationalist bullshit. Oh wait, that doesn't get clicks. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 17:34:15
Wtf? Some weirdo copied my post for whatever reason and now suddenly i'm a suspicious troll using multiple accounts?
I don't know who he is and why he did that. But believe me, it's really easy to copy and paste someone's post. Try it yourself. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 22:53:25
It's ridiculous to assume that every business runs this way and that somehow with Bitcoin everything will be 3% cheaper. 
I certainly wasn't fear peddling on purpose but i'm quite sure you are. 
Anyway, no need to convince me. I use my cc when i need buyer protection and Bitcoin when i don't (and if they actually offer that option of course). 
Good luck convincing the rest of the world to give up their protection though. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 17:35:30
Jesus Christ. I swear some of you people just must be high as fuck all the time. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 17:05:41
ITT: all currencies suffer from hyper inflation and Bitcoin can't go down. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 20:09:29
I'm buying! We're about to go up again!
@_date: 2016-12-30 09:51:20
This is good for Bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-12-25 09:58:04
Ok, now what does that suddenly have to do with this? Another crazy theory?
@_date: 2016-12-26 13:49:59
Yeah well the conversation here is always about how Bitcoin will save the poor. But sorry for mentioning them. 
So now we concentrate on the rich investing instead?
Fine with me, just a bit confusing. Notice how i got downvoted and you get many upvotes?
@_date: 2016-12-29 18:53:56
What does this have to do with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-12-25 16:12:22
I will. Thanks. Sorry that it upsets you so much. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 11:41:49
Not gonna happen. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 20:27:38
Well done. This is how Bitcoin should spread instead of spamming merchants. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 11:30:55
I like to thank myself for being smart and buying in early. Thank you. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 07:16:20
Price up? Fundamentals!!
Price down? Manipulation by the banks!!
@_date: 2016-12-27 10:24:41
Stop giving advice like this you prick. You have no idea where the price will go. You just want him to buy back in so your 0.6 coin will be worth more. 
@_date: 2016-12-26 11:03:30
Because the merchant thing has been tried already and failed. Those who accepted Bitcoin already dropped it. Nobody pays with Bitcoin. It's a waste of time for the merchant. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 21:51:57
No. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 00:09:13
I bought my first shitload of coins when they were 20 bucks you fucking dumbass. Idiot kid. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 17:47:07
When we are talking about people using Bitcoin as money, buying stuff, drugs are by far the number 1 product. Nothing comes even close. 
And there is nothing wrong with that. Actually it's great this is possible and happening. 
Stop trying to find ridiculous excuses why this would not be the case. Bitcoin is being used what it's made for. Using money without a government controling it. As far as i know it wasn't created to "hodl" or trade. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 19:52:02
I did a chargeback recently. It took me 5 mins on the phone with my bank. 
You're highly delusional if you think the future will be people setting up a third party escrow every time they buy something. 
Maybe that will happen in some libertarian utopia island but not in the real world. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 20:04:05
No, it's not safe to say. Nobody knows what it will do in january. That includes you. 
@_date: 2016-12-26 23:58:11
I was writing a huge ass reply explaining basic investment rules and basic economic stuff but just before hitting reply i removed it. 
Complete waste of time. You live in fantasy land and no amount of common sense will take you out of it. 
@_date: 2016-12-26 10:59:26
I'm not making assumptions. 
You and some people you know buying coins is anecdotal. It's no coincidence you also post here. You are a Bitcoiner. Of course you're gonna say Bitcoin adoption is massive. 
In reality it isn't. Localbitcoin volume is tiny for such a huge country. Bitcoin simply is pretty much non-existant there. 
There is a small group of techies that might know about it and buy some here and there. Like you and the people you tell about it. Which is great. But there is no mass adoption or anything even close to it happening.  
Because of messages like yours and the daily clickbait articles posted here new people are thinking Bitcoin is absolutely booming in India and the reason for this price rise while it isn't.

No. After a pump comes a dump. Just like the 100's of times before. I'm sure nobody expected anything different this time. 
@_date: 2016-12-26 18:32:00
I mostly agree with you but you are avoiding one very real possibility of Bitcoin: the price going down. Saving from hyper inflation means nothing if Bitcoin drops 30% overnight. Which it has done before and most likely will do again in the future. 
It's a very unsafe investment. I personally would never recommend it to people who are trying to escape an unsafe currency in the first place. It just doesn't make sense at this point.

Can you show me where i'm trolling exactly?
Or am i considered a troll by calling his crazy credit card logic crazy and you somehow think i'm attacking Bitcoin? Hint: that doesn't make me a troll. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 01:22:35
Good. You seems to be smarter than the average "i want to buy coins and become rich quick" new guy we usually see here. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 20:55:25
I tried btcjam in the past. It's time consuming and risky. If you think you can just throw some coins at it and enjoy your profits you're wrong. 
There is also always the chance of the company getting hacked or dissapearing with your coins. Which is very possible in Bitcoin land. 
I would suggest not using your coins for this. Or maybe just 1 to play around a little.

You're using a service that is built on scammers scamming. I'll let you figure out the rest. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 13:17:12
My fiat?
And who is a shill? A shill for what?
@_date: 2016-12-30 23:07:56
Always the same shit when the price goes up!
@_date: 2016-12-25 09:36:32
Traders trading. 
The theories i read here over the last days are from unlikely to borderline insane. 
If all this mass adoption in whatever third world country was happening, if all these Chinese were fleeing capital controls, why would the price suddenly go down again?
Adoption suddenly stopped today? The fleeing suddenly stopped today?
None of that happened in the first place. What we are seeing instead is traders pumping and dumping. On top of slow general adoption. 
I would say something like 600 is the true adoption price and anything above or under that is just traders doing their thing. With small time investors following. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 22:38:58
Yes. Which i believe without a doubt. And for the rest of the world, the non bitcoin-obsessed techie, this would be highly impractical, pointless and only make things more complicated. 
If you can't understand this then it's time to leave your computer for a while and go outside to see how real life works. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 16:10:09
Me too. Steam is great. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 08:45:09
Haha no. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 09:45:57
By an extremely small group at the moment. With the majority being drugs buyers. (Nothing wrong with that but let's not deny it)
Edit: i'm kinda surprised by the downvotes. I thought it was common knowledge that Darknet markets are a huge part of the current Bitcoin ecosystem. Millions and millions are spend there. I can't think of anything else that's being paid in Bitcoin that gets even close. Seriously, are there still people denying this and downvote me for talking about it?? I thought we were better than that. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 13:23:10
A solution to what??  
Not using credit cards or fiat? By using credit cards and fiat?
@_date: 2016-12-28 14:05:38
Ok, thanks Nostradamus. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 11:55:03
No, it's with the companies selling Bitcoin. Which the discussion was about. Remember? Buyer protection. Nobody was talking about a protocol. 
Not sure what you are trying to do here. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 15:47:39
@_date: 2016-12-29 08:37:51
What is?
@_date: 2016-12-27 15:14:24
What does that have to do with anything? Does the sign up date on Reddit suddenly change facts are something?
@_date: 2016-12-27 18:41:05


Oh yeah, losing 40% overnight due to an exchange hacked would be so worth it! I bet they can't find ANYTHING else to invest in besides Bitcoin that would be safer. Obviously nothing beats Bitcoin when it comes to that, right? 


Haha no you didn't. 


How would Bitcoin with a 10 min wait be faster than a cc exactly?

Unless someone has access to that address and is willing to return the money you will get it back. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 08:38:51
What the hell are you talking about?
@_date: 2016-12-28 00:13:31
Hedging is about decreasing risk. 
I'm gonna stop talking to you. It's like explaining a kid with a lollipop in his mouth that candy is bad. He wouldn't understand it and even if he did he wouldn't care because at that moment the candy tastes really good.
