Switch to eth/alt till you recover a bit or at least lose less
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:09:08
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:59:08
I'll trust BTC again when it will be 250$
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:11:18
Time to love your Prez!
@_date: 2018-01-16 03:32:16
Here it comes the dip we were waiting for
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:27:51
Should go to 2000, people got burned a lot
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:04:57
No more substance to fud on lmao
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:45:05
What do you mean?
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:07:44
Thank you.
@_date: 2018-01-16 03:59:15
What do you mean?
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:01:47
Where do you see that?
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:06:20
Always and forever
@_date: 2018-01-20 03:29:10
Is that a taking off that I see?
@_date: 2018-01-22 02:58:41
Invest in what you would be ok to be burn by. But that you know it won't happen lol
@_date: 2018-01-16 04:51:11
Habits and attachments too.
@_date: 2018-01-25 06:35:28
I wonder what Trump thinks of this
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:49:38
I'm not even a specific tron supporter, I picked the nickname randomly lol
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:02:08
Altcoins will follow!
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:29:10
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:28:36
Just look at GDAX eur something got stuck haha
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:51:12
It's gone lol. Ok
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:16:25
What will crash the whole cryptocurrency thing?
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:17:30
Well, looks like BTC is a too appealing market to let it fall
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:25:47
Only a quick, deep and short last dip is gonna save BTC. Players, think well what you're gonna do, also considering the world out of cryptos, not just getting lost focusing on it. Enjoy your choice on the long term.
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:00:18
Are you going to say the same about SNT?
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:33:09
Ok. I checked at the time, but didn't see it.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:43:58
Is this the end of cryptos
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:54:21
Are they split selling them back already or..?
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:32:36
Is that a HODL or XRP question?
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:44:48
That's why it needs a huge dip asap.
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:05:40
Last time after futures BTC went up, then down, then kept steady for a while, and then went up again. We probably would be in the penultimate stage if other alts weren't taking off
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:07:12
People cashed out for a break lol
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:22:28
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:01:11
Are you going to buy the dip?
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:13:12
Don't be silly. Sell high and buy the dip, expecially with BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:26:27
Where did you get the idea of investing there?
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:47:45
SNT is scamming well and steadily if it's a scam lol
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:21:21
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:49:15
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:16:00
The only one flying for now is SNT
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:26:20
It is flying
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:48:16
15365.21 $
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:11:20
So did you verify he actually endorses it?
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:14:11
Is funny how media warn people about BTC and not other stuff
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:56:34
I'm also not convinced about what is going on there
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:12:18
The instability sown before getting mainstream is already showing. I'm willing to get burn by another crypto, but not by xrp lol
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:09:05
What are your crypto news sources?
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:18:12
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:15:32
Waiting, not expecting
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:09:47
7 days max
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:41:05
I'm still waiting for the 10k
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:45:49
not yet
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:18:57
Don't forget to thanks
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:05:43
In some hours another mess might take place, let's see
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:25:50
Sown. Also, it used to be the one among other invested crypto to keep the balance down
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:15:19
Never gamble while drunk
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:18:37
Thank you in advance, let's average lmaoo
@_date: 2018-02-19 21:48:55
Yeah I know of that; someone will use it as an excuse to crash the market, either to buy or burn people enough to stop them buying, or the ramification would cause so much damage that it will be decided to delay the boom at a better moment, you know, meanwhile fixing with upsides and downs ¬¬
@_date: 2018-02-15 11:23:51
It's all gambling without luck lmao the main rumor about BTC price is tied to Tether but no one knows when it's going to explode, if ever.
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:10:35
Wow. I read many people in this thread in the past saying that was a good exchange lmao
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:52:56
Thanks to those "bastards" the BTC price went over 5k
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:39:11
Looks like you didn't pray enough!
@_date: 2018-02-05 07:45:14
Suggestion: give a look to the coins full list. One of the cheapest could be on the right path to surprise you.
@_date: 2018-02-05 07:15:03
I see a 2.5k
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:30:40
Then you should be glad BTC is starting to get at its own true priced value again.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:52:01
You guys didn't pray enough?
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:04:15
Just another redditor has spoken lmaooo
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:49:28
Yeah, I keep having that feeling of NOPE
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:08:23
50k soon
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:56:15
Omg, you deserve donations for your blessed gesture
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:29:21
So proud of having you among humans!
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:29:43
Flat? lol
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:24:14
This sounds so cute lmao
@_date: 2018-02-11 06:02:00
Yeah thx lol
@_date: 2018-02-13 09:13:54
Because its price is getting more and more attractive
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:35:38
"I didnt say it crashes" -.-'
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:55:35
Did you miss a 0 by any chance lmao
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:20:56
And don't panic sell :'))
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:57:00
Hodler? When did you buy in? lmao
@_date: 2018-02-05 07:13:38
I picked that nickname randomly, nice assumption lmao
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:47:13
OMG there are still people putting money in this shit; guys, the price is still too high.
@_date: 2018-02-11 07:46:40
Yeah, something the graph couldn't sustain in that very moment with the data at that time
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:50:03
What kind of competence are you in need of that you lack yourself?
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:15:33
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:33:08
No winners in such a world
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:49:39
When 6k??
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:00:43
Tell him that it's about how many BTC you hodl, not its price.
@_date: 2018-02-05 05:06:45
So, what's the next big thing?
@_date: 2018-02-11 05:22:09
I'll jump in at 5560 &lt;3
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:50:47
2017? Shills you mean?
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:18:28
Ye          .
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:21:07
Or an already existent cheap emerging coin!
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:33:05
I'm pretty sure a shitty shilling was going on that was educating people into hodling and such idealistic bs.
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:23:37
Nick lmao
@_date: 2018-02-11 07:21:41
They're marketing and shilling lmaooo
@_date: 2018-02-15 08:48:38
It crashed a bit soon after lmao
@_date: 2018-02-11 05:57:59
It's just a perception
@_date: 2018-02-19 21:15:46
Wow expecting that low? lmao well, I actually used to consider a 2.5k
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:56:06
Heart lies in wise bravery lmao
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:53:02
You're a regretter, even worse.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:35:53
Do you know how BTC prolly reached that high of a price value?
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:24:10
Few get the bottom of actual spikes, and prolly after several faulty previous attempts. Split the amounts.
@_date: 2018-02-12 12:28:36
Synchronized bots?
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:56:41
Only if no one will buy or hodl anymore
@_date: 2018-02-11 07:37:33
Nope, I was like wtf, then refreshed
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:30:12
Yeah. Fucked or rewarded. No other possibility lmao.
@_date: 2018-02-11 06:55:14
Lol to get the most significant edge most of the time you just gotta go where no one else goes and wait lmao. Plus, no matter the experience, you never know about market's behavior in the short run till you don't know the temporary data of how much inflated it is.
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:40:29
I missed the dip, give me a new one!
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:20:26
Can you guys let it crash once and for all so we can all invest in this (now) shit and lift it up even higher than ever, yes??
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:03:53
It's everyone's bitch, duh
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:13:47
BTC price can go very higher, but first, it needs to get deflated (...).
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:11:42
Can't you do any alternative action to get out of there?
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:54:05
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:33:52
It won't be that easy to get in at the right moment tho, either late, or too early..
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:32:06
Are you talking about that support that gets deleted when approached?
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:12:39
Maybe they sold already, in 2014 :O
@_date: 2018-02-11 05:29:55
5560.98$. Because 1d chart's trend suggests me so! It will prolly drop futher tho, 5226 or so
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:43:18
Nice nickname :O
@_date: 2018-02-19 21:51:27
We need more fortunate bugs lmao
@_date: 2018-02-16 11:21:33
What did you warn people about
@_date: 2018-02-11 07:44:44
You're on your way to get some psychosomatic fever which does surprisingly well to the psyche.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:02:48
That means nothing.
@_date: 2018-02-04 09:26:46
LMAO. It's not the truth till it doesn't happen, easy.
@_date: 2018-02-11 19:15:28
What's going on with BTC
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:32:13
I lost enthusiasm.. might be because the dip didn't show yet, or because the market will take too long to recover lmao
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:28:04
Hey tweeny
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:26:41
Lol so you're the "responsible people who actually understand crypto". I bet you didn't go further the hype and repetitive history factor!
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:30:29
Who are you.
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:28:37
Are you going to try hibernation to last that long..?
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:49:38
Every time I insult myself after a while I realize I did it very wrongly lmao
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:24:38
They say it happens every year.. but that can't happen to infinite
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:30:39
People keep praying but it is never enough! I wonder why!
@_date: 2018-02-11 07:24:33
Yesterday I've seen a temporary graphic showing a huge vertical dip. I'm not sure if that was a twisted lie or a glitch in the truth help
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:00:47
Yeah, it actually never went up.
