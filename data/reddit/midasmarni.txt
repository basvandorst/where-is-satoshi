If you take the course, you will see. Coinbase does not allow you to send the bitcoin. They do in the API "theoretically" -I am not an active programmer, but I can see it in the code. But it is not available with Zapier.

I am guessing so ya.

Speaking of fees what will the merchant pay on their end? Normal credit card processing fees?

Love your thoughts. Imagine how the world will be in a few years with that sort of impact on so many people. I think we are looking at a very different long term future than we were a few years ago when everyone was in debt over their heads. This financial education will be invaluable in the years to come for so many. 
Re your last thought about moving money. I remember when my mother died and I received $100,000 from her life insurance in the form of a Canadian check. I spoke to my then bank here in the States, Bank of America. They wanted 12 weeks and $ 3,000 of my money. I thought, "Oh hell no, that's not going to happen!" 
I flew to Canada, opened two accounts with HSBC deposited the check, moved the money and made $ 50 on the transaction (not accounting for my flight or anything - just exchange rates at the time.) I took control of my money, because it was MINE. 
I think the American banks and a lot of the world banks have forgotten whose money it is, and frankly so have we. They have hooked us up to the debt/tax machine and made us all addicts. Our thinking is cloudy. 
Bitcoin is rehab people. Take control, take your life back! Viva Bitcoin.

My son plays on a minecraft server that pays him Bitcoin for each block he mines.

Way to go. I felt the same. I have been a technology evangelist for years. Usually for a specific product but like you I have not been excited like this since the internet started. Evangelizing an entire technology is much more exciting.
I am on the education side of things. Educating the general public and businesses about what Bitcoin means to them. I've got my work cut out for me over the next few years.

Just make sure the Visa/MasterCard debit cards say something like "Backed by Bitcoin". So that it starts to get the general population understanding. 
By the way, love you wallet. It is my personal favorite.

Yes, and I actually do want to know the objections.

Wow are you ever a classic case of a Neanderthal man. Lol. I happen to be one of the women mentioned in this article. I have owned my own business for 12 years. I make more money than most men.
I happen to be helping your Bitcoin gain value by evangelizing it. You are welcome.

You are doing a great job Andreas. I learn more from you every day. Keep up the great work. I know it's nerve wracking, but we need you out there. I am studying all I can to get up to speed. 
@_date: 2014-08-23 16:31:31
Agreed. I think the Coinbase 5 day delay is a major pain in the butt.

I wrote this post about my first experience with Circle. So far I am a happy girl. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:49:28
Thanks Erik, I appreciate the sentiment and the call to action. I will carry on! 
@_date: 2014-09-23 02:27:35
The course, that I linked to explains the issue with Coinbase. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 20:26:03
I just wrote a blog post on why I've decided to accept Bitcoins in my business and why I think others should jump onto the bandwagon too. I am just 6 days into Bitcoin, but I already can't sleep!

I am now wondering if they scooped Apple. I wonder what Apple has up their sleeves? I don't really care at this point. This clearly places bitcoin directly into the mainstream. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 00:28:44
I think Circle goes a long ways towards getting the mainstream to use Bitcoin, so I featured them on my show today. 
@_date: 2014-09-23 02:26:30
You can't use it with their email though, it is social media as far as I understand it. 
@_date: 2014-09-23 02:25:48
It is in the mainstream mind now. Not in usage, sure.

Hi Andreas,
Marni Melrose here. We met in Los Angeles and then talked on the phone and you gave me some great ideas. I am doing just that. Just finished becoming a member of the Digital Currency Institute down here in San Diego. I am attending the meetups here in San Diego and Orange county on Bitcoin. Steve asked me to speak on a global webinar for the institute in April and the Rotary club has asked me to speak for them as well in April. Thanks so much for your guidance. I soak up everything you say and it's starting to come out of my mouth so we are getting there. 
I'll contact the local news and journalists next week. 
Be well,

Because my end goal is bitcoin adoption. It would be awesome if somewhere on the front of the card it would say backed by bitcoin. And on the back of the card it would say "If you took bitcoin directly you would not have to pay the credit card processing fees on this transaction" - THAT my friend would be a card I would be proud to use!
