Ou buy for 7 sell for 6? If you sold all them on an exchange they would continue to go down. You can’t just dump 600 btc on an exchange that’s completely irresponsible for your wallet and the market. Let’s say 600 btc order shows up. Immediately everyone will sell for cheaper to avoid being the last to sale. This is what spoofing accomplishes. OTC is for investors looking to sale otc usually. I buy 12k btc for 7k/btc I sale for small profit majority then I sale a little at a riskier profit then the last bit you can hodl until the time is right. What is actually happen is called spoofing people make the volume look like it’s going up in reality they are buying their sales pushing the price up then when the market can not support the lack of buyers the market crashes. You can see this when the order books start going off on the buys and you notice people are buying above market price....let that sink in ABOVE market price who does that? People knowing it will go up so they may sale on you. After this ain’t spike we consolidate and again volume cannot withstand price as there are no more buyers again the market crashes no otc involved you can watch the order books. This is why the sec is coming in hard and why Coinbase is scared. They know it’s happening...I’ve watched it myself and my jaw dropped. Dca you should be fine.

I there specific alt coin you are speaking of? I you think bitcoin (a storer if value) can compare to Dapps and the infrastructure to sue so I think you should learn more about FA (fundamental analysis). What happens wen difficulty reaches an almost impossible rate and no miner makes money? It’s my thought they would leave them what? Will our network be secure?? Nope we will exponentially loose hashpower and then be left for any large pool to over power the network. I wish you the best but don’t turn a blind eye 
@_date: 2018-06-15 15:58:18
I think usdt sucks volume out more than pushes the price up. It may have a small impact but it is number 2 on 24hr volume wen btc crashes.

What happens when difficulty reaches max and rewards halved enough times to be worthless? How are we gunna secure the network then? Only way is government subsidies. Why would miners stay when the reward mathematically gets smaller and smaller more and more difficult a the yes go on when they could mine something with more growth ahead of them?

Welcome to the team. Btc is notoriously slow to send to binance. Make sure to send I gdax first for free transfers. Another technique people use is to buy with Ethereum or litecoin to make the transfer to speed up he process. However be patient nd let the game come to you!

@_date: 2018-06-16 23:12:08
I’m sure with binance being on the front lines they have done all the appropriate audits. The point is that people actually take this seriously. Binance also like to critique other exchanges and claims they have less volume than they say. To test this they tried to sell btc on different exchanges and some couldn’t handle the volume
@_date: 2018-06-11 23:36:42
I’m sorry I may be referring to the reward. However the result would be the same. Miners will go where the profit is. Unless they have moral reasons to say or a Government subsidized them similar to corn in America. Skycoin incentivizes users to give bandwidth with skycoin.

They suck the volume out of it. And can push it up but so does usd and taking profit from alts. I would say it takes more than gives the market. A lot of volume was hedged. No buyers at higher prices immediately drop the market value. If milk was 10 dollars less people would buy it unless there was a shortage. There is no shortage of btc in circulation tho it has a finite amount there isn’t a strong enough demand yet. Then add 1500 altcoins with 98% just volume suckers. Soon th volume will come back but treat the market like the stock market. Sprint PCs has continued growth but there shares have actually gone down for years even tho att and t sucks balls in every way they have more value able stocks. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:16:31

@_date: 2018-06-10 18:20:20
Regulations, more usd/stable pairs, sec investigations, no more spoofing soon, realizations that blockchains with fees or “gas” tokens traded on the market (they should be worthless to us but value able to computers), Multiple futures contract with a tiny market cap(add 10 bill and the market freaks out add 350 and all hell breaks loose) I would suggest but not advise investing in quality projects. Essentially what you are doing is hedging against btc. eventually usd and usdt etc pairs will continue to suck the volume of btc out and btc will suffer. eventually a divergence in usd and btc values of coins will happen. Never forget your fundamental analysis of markets and make sure to invest in capable teams and projects!

The stack, supply, and demand are stabilizing. We are readying for consolidation. From there it’s tank city or moon city. The three concepts above will dictate price.

@_date: 2018-11-09 16:57:42
They don’t have to dump for a price drop see comment above. If you sell potatoes and you decide to buy a million potatoes at 10 dollars a potato but people only want to spend 6 dollars a potato the people that bought potatoes at 4 dollars can sell for 6 make a profit and cut out the person who bought for too much. If the majority have 4 dollar potatoes and can meet that demand well shit luck for the people who bought high. Supply and demand is based off the majority of people. If more want to buy for less and more people will sell for less the lower the price will go.

and tether is a volume sucker imo. with tether we need so much more money than we originally did to push btc especially with people leaving money in there between trades. they uuse to just hedge into btc and btc would be the storer of value. theres alot of variables right now. until we get more volume in the stack theres not gunna be much raise like before

Yeah pretty confident I’ve been calling oversold since eth was above 1200 and charted 3200 with ease...my pockets are happy. We were over sold in June 2018 yet we sold more. Just because an indicator says oversold means nothing. Oversold with that steep of decline and a pop that ou mentioned would not follow charting mechanics as well as would be considered a bull trap...
@_date: 2018-12-15 03:36:26
Also this is done with brave new coin which will have different charting mechanics. I sill haven been able to discern whether the majority uses that or another pairing/calculation for btc. I tend to use this chart as well as btc/usd on coinbase and bitfinex as they have the largest volumes (can be synonymous with more investors)

I think the misunderstanding came with the force on loans. If I were forced to a specific rate I would just go elsewhere. You may not think that people have that choice but we do!

Just use coinbase they don’t try and trick you. Make sure to store you crypto in a proper hardware wallet (ledger, Trezor) once you get the hang of everything make sure to stay safe and enjoy your time. 
Side note: if there is a alt coin that says a specific use case generally stay away( logistics only etc). All use cases they claim can be done on chain or with a side chain pegged to any block chain generally. Using Eos neo btc doesn’t really matter as long as their client is satisfied. Look at businesses and why they would use their services ie: why would Facebook use eth/btc/eos etc. it’s a lot of info but we are early in the space so there is still misdirected folk and many laymen posing as experts
