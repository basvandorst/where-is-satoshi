it would be 16 million actually.

Why do people always care so much where someone stores their Bitcoin.  I see this response on almost every post about having Bitcoin.

I’ve never been tipped!  Thanks!  Have to learn how to get it out.

That's not how it works.  You get a slip of paper and then go online to their website and it's there in a wallet.  You're desperate to knock the price down.  It's sad.

That is what you can do.  The guy is spreading FUD.

People will use it because it saves time on the receivers end.  Travel emergencies, for instance.

The fee for bitcoin purchases is 4 percent.  But yes Coinstar fees are too high.

You guys really are working overtime to try to knock down the price.

I doubt they can know what you are doing once you move your btc.  This sounds a lot like FUD to me but of course, I can't prove that wasn't your experience.

You can do up to 10k a day with the cashapp it says on there.  
@_date: 2018-12-29 04:28:55
What part is failing specifically?  Could you explain?
@_date: 2018-12-29 04:25:58
If you try it I would like to hear how it went for you.  Maybe I got lucky or something. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 04:27:09
It never worked in what way?  The thing works extremely well.
@_date: 2018-12-29 04:26:38
What was your problem?  It let me withdraw right after I verified my ID. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 04:20:44
The fees were cheap so that's what matters to me.

Yes you can sell your bitcoin and send it right to your bank account.  Also you can get the money instantly in your bank account if you pay a fee.  I made 4 dollars on my initial purchase and sold 4 dollars worth and then cashed out to my bank account for a 6 cent fee just to try it.

I think they have a deal with exchanges but they might match transactions within their own user base as well.
