This is the most accurate post I have ever seen.

My parents sold my house out from under my wife and me, and I needed the fiat.
@_date: 2018-05-19 13:51:37
Actually, I had just received my PhD and was in the middle of a job hunt (getting an academic job is a bit like winning the lottery, and my muscular dystrophy limits my options even further) when my father told me out of nowhere, “I’ve sold the house.” I thought that was a tad un-fatherly.
But please, continue making assumptions about someone you’ve never even met.
@_date: 2018-05-19 13:54:26
It’s all good. I probably would’ve made the same assumption. :-)

Can you explain? 
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:08:04
Yep, and I’ve used it there before. It only works for pre-paid hotels, though; it doesn’t work for reservations where you’re expected to pay when you arrive at the actual hotel.

How is that even possible? I thought OpenBazaar was decentralized?

Right, but that’s just a local tax. Unless the hotel itself accepts bitcoin, you have to prepay the rest of it through Expedia.
@_date: 2018-03-11 01:08:17
It would be hubris to attempt to improve upon bitcoin? Seriously? Satoshi isn't some kind of deity, you know.

I know what I said. Try looking up his actual views.


The fact that you thought this helps your case is pretty funny, I’ll give you that.

This guy is an actual fascist.

I will take your Monero.

Paul Gottfried? As in Richard Spencer’s mentor, Paul Gottfried?

Dude, you share Breitbart articles. I don’t think I’m going to get anywhere with you. The best I can do is ensure that people see my comment and don’t mistake your shit for shinola. I’d be lying if I said it didn’t help my case that you straight-facedly defend his “anti-unrestricted immigration” position while advocating the inviolability of oneself over one’s own body. That made me smile.
Good day.

I think it’s a fine complimentary currency. The key is *complimentary.* I prefer a certain other currency (which I won’t name because shilling sucks), but BTC is road-tested and technologically stable for the most part. It won’t and shouldn’t replace fiat (there’s a reason we got rid of the gold standard, for instance), but it’s an amazing way to give people power over their money and lives without bringing the state into the equation.

You seem well-versed in the affairs of National Socialists *to me.* 
The problem with fascists is that they are fundamentally bad-faith actors. Take Hoppe, for instance: at one point, he adopted the risible position that non-libertarianism (any and all forms) are *a priori* and logically incoherent by virtue of the fact that they are non-libertarian. *Logically.* 
That is some first-rate bad-faith right there. 
They are quite literally not worth talking to; they throw the chess board into the air, shit on it, and then declare victory.
@_date: 2018-07-24 00:46:36
I’m actually talking about his (well-documented anti-immigration and anti-homosexual positions)[ 
Of course, there’s also the fact that his economic system of choice will lead invariably to a degree of inequality such that it might as well be slavery. But that’s typical of “anarcho”-capitalism, and not what makes Hoppe...special.
@_date: 2018-07-24 02:03:42
Also, I *own* Gottfried’s book *Fascism: Career of a Concept,* among others. I am not intimately familiar with his work, but it’s by no means alien to me.
@_date: 2018-07-24 02:25:46
I *am* an anarchist. I did my dissertation on anarchists. I even used to be an “anarcho”-capitalist when I was, you know, 16.
Hoppe is not an anarchist and wouldn’t know one if he saw one.
