I am wondering, why don't we focus on what is best for the legacy of crypto. Bitcoin will always be valuable, because it started all this. There is room for everyone and there is room for LOTS of innovation. Is it possible that we could work together to make the ENTIRE project work. I will bet you that Roger respects Bitcoin. It is his reason for having what he has and being able to do what he is. I think his intentions are good, even if, in reality, he is making a mistake. (It takes me a long time and a lot of research and meditation to make an opinion). We should figurevout how to NOT be devicive and all get back on the same team. I'm sure this is a long shot, but I am throwing it out there anyway. Let's all fiure out how to get rich and make as many other people rich as we can. The abundance mentality. There is enough for everyone. I learn from Reddit everyday. Thank you guys. Sincerely. I appreciate (almost) every opinion. It feeds my mind.

Absolutely! All of us have a sundae. Let's just agree to eat!

Have a look at Presearch. Decentralized Search. I am beta testing the product now. Maybe Google will lose some of their market share to the blockchain soon...

That was a quote from Snoop that he made long after taking his finger off of the pulse that originally gave him life as he knows it... In other words, by the time he was using that line, he had already sold out. I, personally, quit listening to Snoop long before he made that song. You, and everyone else should too.
