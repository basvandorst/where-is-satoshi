It's a hindrance to startups.  Imagine if Apple said you had to have $5,000 to sell an app in their store... they'd have a lot less apps.  Sure big names wouldn't care but all the indy makers would be fucked.  The same is true in this case.  They're saying **anyone**...meaning vendors of any sort.  Small business owners and sellers of anything are all included.  There will be a lot less people accepting bitcoin.

It requires a $5000 fee?  That's insanely high.  I hate when governments do this.

I read the article there.

PayPal and ebay are moving apart so maybe you and your friends will just skip them and use visa. That's the point of this discussion. I'm saying that Since PayPal is changing they must adopt new ideas to actually get customers. They won't have forced ebay customers. 
One that guaranteed revenue stream is gone PayPal must change. They could slide into western union territory and Bitcoin. If they took their existing retailer relationships and added hassle free Bitcoin options with fantastic international services then it would be a great new product. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 14:05:01
I think there's a shot that PayPal could dominate payments. If they do away with insane fees for international transactions and they adopt Bitcoin then they'll thrive.

It's still a foolish gamble that more than likely could have fucked him.

Op is right. I myself haven't even tried because the process requires too many unclear steps and too many hands touching my money. 
You know what's easy? Signing up for Charles Schwab and investing money. Takes a few clicks and no hassle.

Yeah of course. He'll back in the day people used Pokemon cards to deal drugs. And obviously anything of value can be used to buy and sell drugs.

I don't know why I can't load this link. China probably censored it and I'm on my phone. 
I used to send my salary home via bank transfer and it would be a terrible experience every time. So many bank employees here in China have no experience dealing with foreigners if you live away from the bubbles of expats. So you have to go to multiple banks and talk with reps on the phone who are trying to help. Then they have stupid restrictions where foreigners can only convert $500 a day. If I want to send home 20k then I've got to returned to the bank everyday until my frustration level takes years off of my life. 
The experience is often so similar for others. Eventually I would just get a rep's number and text message them and only go into the branch if they were there. After converting $500 each day I finally have enough to transfer so I return with my SWIFT code and other bank details. I fill out the forms and send it. The process takes hours because of general incompetence and rookiness. The fee is ~$20. 
Five days later I get a call that my money can't transfer because a detail is wrong. I double-check my forms and I wrote everything correctly. What's the issue? The clerk input the information wrong. I have to return to the bank and painfully restart the process. They try to charge me $20 again. I explain I already paid. Bla bla. I hand them a printed out paper with the details written so no ambiguity in my writing fucks things up. 
It goes through but instead of $20,000 showing up in my account I get $19,985 and Wells Fargo tacks on another $16 fee. 
So that's $20+$15+$16=$51 and too much frustration to shake a stick at. 
Now I used Bitcoin and it costs nearly nothing. I fill my account at OKCoin or BTCchina then transfer it to circle and eventually Wells Fargo. Never do I speak to a rep and never do I make mistakes. 
Thank you Bitcoin.

This sounds like OP is a shill. 
@_date: 2014-12-02 14:41:19
And if they don't adapt their model then they will buy politicians across the world and Bitcoin will either be outlawed or really difficult to work with.

Can you link to canadian bank accounts? 
I'm trying to figure out how to send money to an account with bank of Montreal. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 17:46:04
So how can you buy Bitcoin using a Chinese bank account?  
@_date: 2014-10-14 23:42:27
I'm in the opposite boat. I am trying to use OkCoin to transfer money from China to the U.S.  It a huge fucking hassle. 
I'm two weeks in and they're holding my money for address and passport verification. I was able to buy Bitcoin with CNY but can't send Bitcoin to circle to deposit in my bank. 
I'm so frustrated with this process. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 06:42:31
I don't think that's his argument.  I think what he was saying is that many think Bitcoin = ... = Silkroad/drugs/etc
I don't agree but if it's something he brought up from a business perspective then it's something to think about especially considering the other good things he said.
@_date: 2015-05-24 02:14:38
I agree with everything you said. 
I've lived here for 4 years and I'm definitely over it now.  The constant hassle never stops.  I hate the constant lies and associated laziness, like in your story.  The reality is the people who helped you are lazy and they're used to giving any answer instead of saying "hey I don't know, give me a few minutes to check." I have 50+ instances like this and it kills me.  At the bank, stores, train stations, government offices, hospitals, etc.  It sucks.
To visit and travel are great but to live permanently is not an option.
@_date: 2015-05-28 02:14:06
The point is still valid.

He was breaking laws in Australia.  Australia has an extradition treaty with the US.  He was doing illegal business in the US.
Take your pic.
@_date: 2014-10-03 01:00:33
He does have a point regarding the mainstream public. My dad knows fuck all about Bitcoin but when i was talking about using it to send money home he mentioned the Silk Road, 'isn't that online money used to buy drugs?'
Obviously this is ignorant but I'm positive he's not alone. I think Gates' statement is more about getting beyond the feeling gd a shady thing and getting to the point that it's a currency.

I live in China and have for four years. Okcoin is definitely based here and specifically in Beijing. I use okcoin. 
Reading your comment is like a summary of how a vast majority of Chinese businesses work. Contracts mean shit so they're rarely honored. Especially when they feel you got the better end of the deal. I could give countless examples of this but I'm on my phone. 
The other issue is how little regard for the law, or any rules in general, there is in China. Anything from tiny rules like waiting in line or  driving in your own lane or to big laws. It's a common practice for landlords to sign a multi year lease agreement then just inform you rent has increased a year later. When you refuse to pay they'll get the utilities shut off and force you out then open a copycat business right there to steal your customers. 
I want to rant further but I won't. Suffice it to say your post sums up business in China.

I definitely use OKCoin to buy bitcoin in China with CNY then send it to Circle and withdraw it.  I'll think I'll start using BTCChina more now.
@_date: 2015-05-24 02:07:24
That's exactly what I expected too.
@_date: 2014-12-01 02:15:39
You're exactly right. Which is why, I fear, the powers that control monetary systems will kill it. 
I buy Bitcoin with CNY in China (I live and work here), send it to my Circle account than withdraw it in USD and the total cost is nearly nothing. I actually end up making money usually. 
Compared to western union or bank wire transfers which are always around $30-50 to send a few thousand USD. 
Good luck in Iran. I know with Sanctions hitting them they have to bypass currency issues and Bitcoin will let them do that. This would empower Iranians and thus Iran but it would undermine the power of the sanctions, thus pissing off those folks. It will be an uphill battle.

My BTC was worth 46,000CNY last month and is now worth 31,000CNY.  That's a crash.
@_date: 2015-02-09 16:19:35
Yes it's a bit of a hassle but bear in mind I buy then send and convert all at once. 
@_date: 2015-02-06 13:20:41
The comparison is valid when you go to purchase things with bitcoin and it purchases less than before.  A lot less.
@_date: 2015-02-13 17:40:52
Yeah I'm just highlighting how a kid picked that out. 
I try to focus on how it's a currency independent of government bullshit. That's king for me.

I use OKCoin to send my salary home from China. It's far cheaper than western union or wire transfers. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 15:01:54
In both instances it's the bank. But also I am send from a time zone almost opposite.

I teach 9 graders in China. I gave a lesson on Bitcoin and they are that shit up. 
Student: "Teacher, so I can buy and sell it for more and if I do this enough I can make more and more money and never have to work?"
Me: "....well... Yeah if you're really lucky and--"
Student: "I'm going to buy Bitcoin!"
@_date: 2015-03-12 23:57:21
Yes, actually I mostly agree.
I live in China and see the massive manufacturing facilities and the wonders to the environment that they bring.  I have seen many companies get up and go, though.  Many aren't going "home" to Europe or America but they're going to Vietnam, India, and so on so they don't have to deal with such a hostile government.
@_date: 2015-02-09 22:39:56
I am actually considering this. Thank you. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 22:39:21
It's already similar to the bank process. In China there are a bunch of people at the banks who don't know what they're doing. So they insist you bring more papers with you and fill out more forms. So you have to insist, then get a manager and finally have it done but it always takes like 2 hours at the bank unless you live in a place with a ton of foreigners, which I do not.

I have permanent residence in California. That's where my house is. I'll just use that address. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 15:36:50
I legally work here in mainland China. I have accounts with ICBC here and Wells Fargo at home. I further signed up for circle.com which required a US phone number which I have through Google voice. And I signed up for okcoin.cn (not .com!). 
First I go to okcoin and I select how much money I want to add to my account. I do it then it prompts me to message info on QQ once I've sent them an ebank transfer for whatever amount I want. I send screen shots and the confirmation codes. Wait ~20 minutes and they load it onto my account but be sure to start with 100¥ to learn how. Then I buy btc with that money and send it to circle. Once it arrives I can withdraw the money directly to any bank I have linked. In my case I withdraw to Wells Fargo and bam. Done. The last step takes a few days. And I usually end up making money on the process. 
The difficulty lies in the initial setup. I had to send okcoin all kinds of shit. ID, proof of address, work permit, etc.  
@_date: 2015-02-09 22:42:35
Thank you but they don't have CNY conversion yet. I signed up and I'll wait. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 14:52:02
Actually wire transfers take ~3 days but with btc I first must send money to okcoin then wait a few hours. Buy btc then send it to circle. Withdraw from circle and wait about 5 days.
