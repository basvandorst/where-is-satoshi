You can find some information about that abbreviation on Google. I'm not sure I would be allowed to actually inform you about it here.
@_date: 2018-09-03 20:18:01
Or maybe they've been instructed to let them trade, but have "technical issues" when they try to withdraw, to give more time for the feds to track down where they're connecting from.

So with just 2 layers, what happens when channels get unbalanced or need more funds? And what do you mean by "flexible instant moving"? In which way is just 2 layers rigid and non-instant?

Since we haven't seen similar levels of activity since then, we can't really say if SegWit really makes that much difference in practice; but we have seen the average fee required to get on the next block rising slightly during periods of slightly increased activity, which suggests it might not be doing much.
@_date: 2018-08-22 22:21:55

Heh, I knew that didn't sound right.
But either way, my question still stands, why commit data in an invalid state?
edit: as for reproducing the bug; I don't wanna risk corrupting files of other programs, and it's a PITA to wait for the client to finish doing everything again after it screws up...
@_date: 2015-05-11 19:03:07
Because it sounded like he thought reindexing was responsible for the whole computer crashing, when that wasn't the case; reindexing happens after the crash.
Here are the last couple lines in the debug.log during the last time the client itself crashed after I rebooted due to a system-wide crash:
    2015-05-11 17:50:50 ERROR: CBlockUndo::WriteToDisk : OpenUndoFile failed

@_date: 2015-05-11 18:40:57
No, just the client crashes during reindexing. But it does make everything freeze once in a while; it got much better after the last update, but it still happens.

What exactly was encrypted? Just the files while stored on the hard drive?
It might've been possible to obtain the keys from the RAM, or even extract them as they were going thru the processor. Or even just control his machine remotely and instruct a BTC client to make the transaction.

Even if we assume it wasn't tampered with after his arrest, it could still have been planted there beforehand with malware.

Tell me more about the journal. What did it say? And what are the odds someone would have a similar enough handwriting on accident? And what about on purpose?
As for catching him with the laptop; even if we could trust that they didn't modify the laptop afterwards, it would be almost trivial for them to make the laptop do whatever they wanted with a backdoor.
@_date: 2015-05-10 15:37:33
It's basically about weighting acting fast on payment against how much money you're willing to risk losing and how much effort it would be required to steal that amount.
@_date: 2015-05-31 20:50:38
Unless they were incompetent or someone leaked relevant information, there wouldn't be much evidence left. Remember, we are talking about people that years ago were already capable of installing malware in the firmware of components, peripherals etc, even in the very infrastructure of the Internet.
Hell, these are the people who infect innocent civilians with malware and let them be arrested for what their machines were forced to do.
And besides; how can we know they didn't plant some CP or worse in his machines to blackmail him into playing along with the kangaroo court?

Long term the tendency is up; but in the short term, it's much harder to predict.
@_date: 2017-03-27 01:37:00
Hm, what if they just delay lower fees to the next block (20 minutes instead of ten if you don't pay enough), associating the size of the fee with the urgency of the processing while guaranteeing all transactions get processed? Wouldn't that help ensure not only maximum profit in the short term but also the growth of value of Bitcoin itself by not limiting it to just the rich?
@_date: 2017-03-30 01:19:04

Hm, I was under the impression that SegWit would be ready when it finally came online.
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:29:21
Even when someone finds a block, the odds of each hash finding a block remains the same (for as long as the difficulty cycle lasts, of course). It's the gambler's fallacy I think; even after you flip a thousand heads, the odds the next coin flip will land heads is still 50% (assuming a fair coin).
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:18:42
Putting aside the risk of orphan blocks, you still have the same chance of finding a block in a given amount of time regardless of when the last block was found.
@_date: 2017-08-25 05:40:42
I would explain the reason and talk about alternatives, but most of the time nowadays it is against the rules of this sub to talk well about anything that has a chance to beat the current Bitcoin. You gonna have to do a little research about the situation outside of this sub.
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:01:05
So the end result all hinges on the one part of the system you haven't modeled, the behavior of the exchanges?
Hm, are there any thresholds, or the magnitude of the effect is proportional to the change in the exchanges with no tipping point?

@_date: 2017-08-22 21:28:38
That's not how it works; once someone else mines a block, you move on to the next block; and you'll still have the same odds of finding that new block as you would have of finding the previous block if no one had found it yet.

Don't take your information from just a single source; research across different communities and sites; inform yourself on various areas that may affect Bitcoin in the future, politics (both on the scale of governments and such, as well as in smaller scales like between and inside communities), economic principles, technical details etc. Don't invest until you're confident that you're responsible for your investment decisions (regardless of whether they lead to profit or loss).
Study past movements in price; it won't give you the ability to predict the future with certainty, but can give you an idea about the different ways things can go.

It's more like talking about different brands of tires.

It's not guaranteed, but I tend to trust more the side that allows discussions of opposing ideas and criticism of their side, and doesn't hide their moderation activities.
But of course, that difference between sides could just be the result of larger conspiracy that is behind both sides, to further the objectives of some third side that doesn't make itself known. But at least when you are free to talk about things it is easier to get to the truth.
@_date: 2017-08-22 00:19:36
Did you take into account the effects on price that the delays and higher fees that come with congested blocks have? (I don't have time to study your code right now to find the answer myself, sorry)
@_date: 2017-08-27 11:02:40
My guess is it was because you probably called it "bcash"; there have been a lot of trolls that refuse to say the whole name. That abbreviation most notably got used in attempts to dissociate it from Bitcoin and redirect people to unrelated subs and sites, by the opposition. It got so frequent that people got a little bit on edge.
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:19:47
Didn't you see what has been happening in the Bitcoin Cash blockchain recently? Because of an excess of hashing power, there was a block every 2 minutes or so; more miners means more blocks found.
For as long as the difficulty doesn't change, other people mining does not affect how many blocks you will find.
@_date: 2017-08-25 08:45:42
Why wait till now to say that?
@_date: 2018-06-08 23:31:49


Would you trust software written by the average person with your money?
@_date: 2017-08-22 00:38:42
That's called [arbitrage]( and aside from moments where the profit is smaller than the fees, I don't think there is anything stopping people from doing it. You just got to be careful to not leave the profit too close to the fees in case the prices move a little between one operation and the other, or worse, too close to random price oscillations that may happen.
@_date: 2018-06-08 23:17:49

I'm skeptical of web screenshots in general, as I said, they're too easy to fake. Whenever I see someone trying to use a screenshot as evidence (as opposed to just as illustration for something that can be verified independently), I try to always remember to remind people of how weak screenshots are as evidence.
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:36:30
Screenshots are quite easy to fake; you don't even need Photoshop, most desktop browsers allow you to edit a page's contents (somewhere on the thing you get when you press F12 on Firefox IIRC; I'm on a phone right now).
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:39:19


And that chance would be wasted if we allow those powers to control Bitcoin.


Interesting that you ignore the company that is funding the developers on your side...
Centralization of control over Bitcoin is itself an attack on Bitcoin. We must be very careful to not confuse Bitcoin with the people trying to control Bitcoin.

It is already very bad practice to let the server see the unencrypted mnemonic at all.

So is SegWit optional or not?
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:37:34
It's a very complex situation with many unknowns so it's hard to tell how things will play out; but personally I'm leaning towards wanting the Core side to "win" because their chain is more crippled and so it's easier to beat.
By the way, thanx for using the full name and not the misleading abbreviation they tried to push to trick people into not finding real information about Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:44:33
Not if you want to pay a fair price to get in a block in the Core chain.

If there is no replay protection, why would you not have the coins in the same address?

@_date: 2017-11-08 21:54:50
How is it optional for bitcoiners?
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:19:29
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:14:32
No, the system itself performs the replay, it's not an attack, people are confusing the terms.
Transactions on both chains will use the same format, and there is nothing keeping the networks from talking to each other and no way for them to tell each other apart; so when you send a transactions you're basically sending the transactions on both chains at the same time. It was not designed to be 2 chains, the Core chain will remain running due to stubbornes.
It might take a few tries (which might cost you because of the high transaction fees), but if the two chains have different levels of congestion you might be able to split your coins by first sending them with a fee too low for one chain but high enough for the other, and then you redo the transaction on the chain that needs higher fees but this time paying enough, and sending to a different address; you need to do this for all addresses you got that have coins in them, and you need to be careful to never use the same address on both chains ever again.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:30:51
So it's not optional for bitcoiners, and we were lied to; ok.
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:27:33
Those centralization fears are unfounded; the centralized control Core and company have over the protocol and the means of dissemination of information should be of much higher concern.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:34:21
Then why have people been saying SegWit is optional and if you don't like it it doesn't affect you?
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:01:43

The fact a small group of people sponsored by just one or two companies that don't have Bitcoin's best interest in mind managed to push such a significant change to the Bitcoin protocol as SegWit, and managed to manipulate the public perception about it so much, is way more concerning than miners who's best interest is the success of Bitcoin pushing out less efficient players.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:40:22
There is no "official" anything; Bitcoin isn't a company, it's an idea; anyone is free to make their own Bitcoin apps.

What about pruning?

It's like investing in companies, or betting in sports; if you're putting any meaningful amount of money into it, you should get informed on whether the company's business model is sound or whether the team you're betting on is actually good enough to win

Three? Ah, I guess if you count Gold, then yeah, it adds up to 3. Doesn't look like Gold is going anywhere though; it's probably safe to ignore it.
The funny thing is there wouldn't be any noteworthy competing chains if Core had done years ago what Bitcoin Cash did in August.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:50:59
Make up your mind, is SegWit optional for bitcoiners or not?
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:57:18
First thing is turn it off and take the battery out to reduce the odds of further damage.
Second thing is go to a trusted repair shop, and be sure to tell them that you got important information in some apps that could cost you money if it can't be recovered.
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:55:42


So paying 4x the fees because Core's code counts each byte 4 times for non-segwit transactions is optional?
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:57:44
So SegWit is not optional for bitcoiners?
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:37:40
How is it optional if not using it is artificially more costly?
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:03:24




@_date: 2017-11-09 07:07:11
It's more like a bubble.
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:08:10
Why should I pay for other people's Bitcoin transaction fees when it was supposed to be so cheap that even the poorer Bitcoin users wouldn't bat an eyelid at the fees? If anyone should shell out money to compensate people for the bad situation Bitcoin is in, that should be Core.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:09:28
If you're not gonna say it, I'm gonna assume unlike what the propaganda said, SegWit is **not** optional.
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:35:15
The alternative is Bitcoin Cash.

Block size will have very little effect on the price of a cheap phone.

@_date: 2017-11-08 22:08:27
Ah, so it's not optional after all.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:39:43
So is it optional or is it not optional?

Freedom, for those that can afford it.

And when layer-3 finally comes, we will wait for layer-4 to solve the issues layer-3 will have? And then wait for layer-5? And 6? Where does it end? Or is the plan to keep waiting forever?
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:43:26
"Freedom, but just for the rich", is not what Bitcoin is about; it's quite the contrary actually.
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:47:35
If the blocks were big enough, everyone would be able to afford their own transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:08:30
Or maybe they just run a good marketing campaign.
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:02:46
You are? So what's stopping you from upping the blocksizes and remaining in control?
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:01:55
Most people don't run their own servers, and yet everyone can access the web and send and receive email. There is no point in making the hardware requirements cheap if people can't afford to actually use the system; meanwhile if you don't hold back improvements for the system you can leave running the backend to people that can afford it, and everyone can afford to use it with lightweight clients.
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:14:33
Hard to say they're without a leader when so many of them are paid by the same company.
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:43:43
What is stopping Core from upping the blocksizes too and remaining in control of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:40:32
Makes you wonder why there suddenly were so many no2xers...
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:46:34
Which part of it?
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:18:01
Even without RBF, with limited block space you never know if a transaction will get thru.
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:56:21


That limited throughput is there because Core refused to upgrade in time and sabotaged many attempts of others to do it as well; it's not an inherent property of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:18:06
It's more like they've kept the number of tables small in spite of having room for more tables, started charging more for the dishes, and put an obstacle course in the entrance, because they're being paid by a food delivery service to push people away from the restaurant.
Meanwhile, there is a competitor with more tables, better prices, faster service, no shenanigans on the entrance etc, that has been gaining more and more costumers because they offer a better service.
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:48:02
Doesn't that cost a lot?
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:30:48
The truth is biased against Core.
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:32:43
Some people proposed a small upgrade, and lots of people want it; lots of other people don't want the upgrade and want to stick with the old system; and both sides will try to keep their networks running; but the thing is, both networks use the same format for transactions and they talk to each other as if they were one network because the upgrade was meant to replace the old version and not work separately from it, so when you make a transaction on one chain, there is a big chance the other chain will hear about it and the system will think you made the transaction there too.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:52:19
Read the white paper, study what Bitcoin was like before other cryptos started showing up, and decide for yourself.

So to run a hub you need to already have a lot money, and not just have a lot of money, but have a lot of money that you don't need to spend anytime soon.
Also, what about the absurd fees you have to pay when creating the channels?
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:01:14
So SegWit is only optional in the sense that people aren't forced to use Bitcoin in the first place?
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:44:41


A few years ago.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:18:33
How can it be optional if you're forced to pay more if you don't use it?

What is the difference?
@_date: 2017-09-10 15:18:25
There was the New York Agreement (NYA), and before that the Hong Kong Agreement (HKA).
I'm not sure how much I am allowed to say in this sub; you're gonna have to google for the details.
@_date: 2017-09-21 03:32:26


Wait, I thought Core had signed the Hong Kong agreement...

At least "companies" is better than "company".

I don't like the sound of that...
Didn't one of those leaked NSA slides said something along those lines?
edit: [SSL added and removed here 😉](
@_date: 2015-03-15 09:13:10
I didn't meant encrypting them together, though that does sound like it might help. I just meant delay the re-transmission until after enough transactions are received by a node.
Though perhaps it might also work if there was simply a random delay that ensured that very often transactions would be retransmitted at a different order than they arrived.
That all, of course, still doing the peeling like how onion routing does, so you can't tell which transaction is which when a node relays it. Eventually the transaction would come out in plain text and get added to the block chain as usual; with equal odds of happening at any node in the network (or as close to that as possible), including the original sender so it can't be figured out by exclusion (though if the distribution isn't equal enough, perhaps excluding the original node would actually help?).
@_date: 2015-03-14 00:58:59
What I mean is: If you see a encrypted transaction being made, and right after that a transaction gets decrypted; that would reveal the IP of who created the transaction. But if the nodes would hold back on the relaying of peeled layered-encrypted transactions and sent a bunch at once, it would be harder to figure out which transaction came from where.
@_date: 2015-10-24 02:06:17
Hm, right. But is it just a matter of most nodes not seeing a boolean flag that says spending is authorized, or is the lock impossible to crack just like regular addresses? Like, is there something mathematically preventing it from being unlocked until the right moment/conditions, or do we trust the network to only give it's ok after just checking the dates and stuff like that?
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:55:59
And the second best is right now
@_date: 2015-03-13 19:57:59
From what I read, Tor doesn't implement a higher latency because for most uses it would get too slow and would discourage people from using Tor more than the risk of correlation attacks; but for Bitcoin in specific, I think a bigger latency can be tolerated.
I haven't run the numbers though; perhaps there aren't enough transactions going around that the biggest delay users are expected to tolerate is still too short for beating the statistical analysis?
@_date: 2015-10-24 01:16:16
There is no possibility a flaw that would take several days with the computing power available at the time to be used maliciously could be found?
@_date: 2017-05-30 03:48:49
What happened to the idea that low-fee/free transactions would just be delayed a lot more than regular transactions but would still be guaranteed to be processed eventually?
@_date: 2015-03-28 00:44:04
At least they weren't subtle about it and ensured you know the device has been compromised.
@_date: 2015-10-24 01:21:05
Is it protected cryptographically, or only thru the consensus of the network?
@_date: 2015-03-13 19:59:02
But with the relatively low latency of Tor, correlation attacks are still possible, no?
@_date: 2017-05-29 02:15:39
No; not enough balls touching.
@_date: 2015-10-24 01:18:06
I think it is because changes that don't got full consensus of the users/miners could risk fractioning the Bitcoin network, or worse, if implemented.
@_date: 2015-02-05 01:34:55
It's all too convenient; it's quite suspicious that someone that was said to be so security-conscious would've made so many stupid mistakes.
@_date: 2015-10-24 03:26:32
There might still be a little time to sell the coins to people that haven't heard the news, or who are betting on the devs fixing things in time.

How can you prove something really is random, and doesn't just look random?
@_date: 2015-02-18 20:06:40
GPS doesn't transmit though.
@_date: 2015-03-13 15:22:02
How difficult would it be to change the wallets and protocol to require that transactions be transmitted wrapped in encryption layers, onion routing style, to hide which IP first transmitted a transaction?
@_date: 2015-03-13 15:49:43
But with Tor, they're not gonna delay the retransmission by too much because of real-time stuff; with Bitcoin, we can afford waiting a while longer since the blocks only come around every 10 minutes or so.
@_date: 2015-10-13 19:22:36
