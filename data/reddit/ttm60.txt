Impossible, it's a very small company and our employees are just shop assistants that lack the knowledge of doing such stuff

Thank you for your response. Below the answers:
* What OS? - Windows Server 2012
* Antivirus? - Yes, we had Norton 360 Antivirus.
* Connected to the internet? - Yes
* Use? - The server has the ERP of the shops installed, and the shops connect to it to check the stock, etc.
* Backups offsite? - Yes, backup daily on Guardian (cloud based copies)

More info.. my dad just told me it's the second time we've been hacked. Last time they encrypted some files (probably to do some ransomware?) and they already formatted the server and did a clean install. So it's the second time they hack the same computer.
Is there anything else besides formatting guys? Really appreciate the help.. (if it's not the right sub to ask this pls let me know)

*R2 sorry just double checked. 
*Don't know what's IIS but yes it's reachable because we can connect to it remotely (I live abroad and some years ago was working with them and connecting to it online)
* It has a real internet IP starting with 2.x. Will check about the firewall, I have no idea

Thanks for the answer, please see my new update, it's the second time the same server was hacked. Last time they encrypted files, and they formatted and did a fresh install. And it happened again, now with this minergate program. Anything else they could do?

Thank you for all the help.. I know, it's not my business it's my parents who run it and they have 0 knowledge about all that stuff. The ERP guys installed the server and seems they were not really profesional. I'm helping them to solve the mess and will help them pay for an IT guy to do all those things you recommend. Again, thank you so much really appreciate it.
