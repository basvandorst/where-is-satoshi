Isn't that new money (newly issued tether) also being spent in altcoins? That's the reason why the Bitcoin price hasn't been increasing significantly. If we'd see a market where Bitcoin is absurdly dominant, then your argument could apply.
One could argue that Tether governance is very similar to fiat governance. Fiat itself was supposed to be backed by something, but nowadays is just backed by government financial engineering...

Thank you Greg. I think it's always good to say 'thank you' when you see Greg's name or any other Bitcoin contributor name. These are individuals that have given a lot to Bitcoin and this whole community. The bitcoin protocol stands strong because of them. Please keep changing the world for the good!

What's the Bitcoin Core plan for scalability? Is there a timeline?

I recommend you have a look at  I relied a bit on it. Overall it's a very easy process. I'd say that it boils down to three key steps: installing raspbian os, bitcoin core and then add the bitcoin.conf configuration file with prune and rpc config... and there you go.

Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (~ $50) with 32 GB spare microSD running Bitcoin Core with 10 GB prune, now in the basement.
No need to download and maintain the whole blockchain in order to prune. The bitcoin core client prunes the data as it is validated. Use e.g. prune=10240
If you like bitcoin, support the network!
