They may well use those bitcoins and trade them on large exchanges. Who would ever know? If bitcoin goes down, they go short with leverage and make a fortune ? Possible ? Who would ever know ?

Thanks for that link. Bitforwarder would know all my private keys, and could easily walk away with funds. The site is new, and it's wise to not trust them.

Jesse said in the hangout [(link)]( a big trader would be on 0.10% + 0.10% for dark pool. He states its not competitive when one just looks at fees, but keeping an eye on other important aspects of an exchange / trading platform would justify current fees. He says he is in for the long haul, pointing at the 'big exchanges' (fines stamp btce i.e.) which do not fully apply to US requirements when dealing with US citizens and stating: It is not a question of IF they will run into bigger trouble one day, but when they will do. And he is just hoping that big traders money is then not stuck in those currently big exchanges.
Jesse Powell seems to me like the right guy doing an awesome job, planning carefully and long term, avoiding costly mistakes and being happy to grow slowly but safe.
Kraken does already 30% of bitfinex volume. and more than half on bitstamp volume.
to me it's a matter of time ones Kraken overtakes bitfinex stamp btce.
Looking at the current fast growing rate, I am speaking a time frame of not more than 12-18 months.

Question: Did you move out all your funds after buying them via coinbase ?
Or, did they suspend your coinbase account and you are still holding bitcoin in coinbase?
What they appear to assume is, that you have used them (Coinbase) to move large(r then normal) amounts to third parties to pay them for 'goods/services' they may have provided to you. They can not rule out that it is related to some drug/weapon/terrorist related activities. There is also a chance they believe you are simply laundering money using coinbase as 'on-ramp helper'
If you can not provide proof of ownership of coins you bought off coinbase, they have to report you (if they haven't already) and what ever you are going to do from now on is going to be monitored by your government.
If they'd allow you without checking on you and if they wouldn't report you, they'd run into problems themselves.
Don't forget, one of the main reasons why services like Coinbase have been created was to
1. make it easy for the average Joe to exchange usd/btc
2. to then be in a position to follow their money(btc) and identify connections
Coinbase is an ongoing well-funded experiment, and what we have heard so far from OP, is just the beginning.
What do we learn from this:
Do NOT use services like coinbase if you have large amounts to exchange for an extended period of time.
If you love your privacy and don't want anyone to know what you are doing with your coins, Coinbase wouldn't be your best choice.

It has started.
People will assume the bitcoin price is going to rise as it also happened during Cyprus crisis back in 2013, even when Cyprus - Greece are not really comparable. 
Thus, the advise must be:
buy bitcoin now if you have not yet, and hold them for a couple of days, then sell with profits.
easy money to be made

The thing is, I am not a coder, and this is why I was hoping that some people might have the very same need ( monitoring bunch of addresses and forwarding incoming spends to a new address ) 
I hoped there exists a downladable software which is already used by some folks.
So it looks like I'd need a a decent bitcoin coder.

@_date: 2015-06-11 21:02:54
so verifying a BitReserve account only means, verifying that email address you signed up with, and a phone number which  could be any prepaid number?
They are asking for fist last name, date of birth, which you can't change later on.
So what kind of account verification is that ? 
What if I just give them fake data ?

How bad is that. Thanks for letting us know.

@_date: 2015-06-22 00:10:52
Thanks for responding to my question.
So I understand you are pointing to an existing risk when I'd adapt a solution where all those privKeys are being held on a server. Agreed - it's hackers dream.
So a possible solution could be, to get notified when an incoming spend occurs, and then having a local running script running on my local computer/server taking care of the transfer ?
@_date: 2015-06-29 10:04:17
So what's next ?
Let the banks go under?
 If they can not run a business they should pack it in. Iceland did not rush to the rescue of its banks and less damage was done to it's economy in the long term as what has happened to the UKs.
People who benefit from bank bailouts are the bankers who make commission on whether they are successful or total failures.

price of bitcoin might go up or down.
you must be clear about that if it goes down (which I hope it doesn't) you likely might loose the largest part of your $50 savings.
If this $50 is money you can afford to loose ( or a large part of it ) then go ahead.
@_date: 2015-06-27 19:57:04
Simple math is telling us, that this is only the beginning...
What does it mean for the price of Bitcoin short term ?
On Monday ( in two days ) when most ATM's and banks of Greece won't have enough cash to hand out to it's customers, we might see a drastically and very fast increasing bitcoin price. 
Conclusion: Buy bitcoin ( go long ) , target $310 short term 1 week

preventing stolen ID's is one thing, but then I have to trust Kraken securing this selfie very good. If Kraken's data get compromised by a hacker or an unhappy co-worker, they would not only stay with my scanned ID card, but also with my selfie holding that ID card in my hand - it's only a short way from here to own my identity and more .... I do not like this idea.
@_date: 2014-03-03 11:45:30
It rounds up the picture I got from Mark over the last months.
And it changes everything. If Mark Karpeles was already in trouble for something similar, the odds on a straight scam are way up and the odds of similar problems on other exchanges are way down (Gox problems nothing to do with Transaction Malleability, just old fashioned fraud).

In case payouts may have to be in Yen only, Kraken has positioned itself to be able to handle them:

The problem I see is, 2 or 3 pools could decide to merge into 1 large pool, and then we  can call it an end to bitcoin like we know it, can't we ?

i guess future payment methods are going to be completely different, may be we are paying/getting paid in energy-units
who knows
@_date: 2014-02-23 15:54:32
Let's say MtGox manages to get back to open in a few hours / days. But hey guys, really ... what are we supposed to expect then? 
What we all have to  keep in mind is, Gox still didn't figure out how to manage all those 10000s USD withdrawal requests.
At first we may see some btc withdrawals requests being processed, for verified users only. Probably with 'x' time delay. 
Gox knows, that actually everyone, well may be 80% if not more of their users want to get out of gox. If Gox would let them out = process all withdrawal requests, they weren't able to continue with business as usual - which is why (theory) Gox management already decided to NOT open again.
Well, I personally actually can't see a future for Gox.
People won't forget what happened / is happening.
It wasn't intended to be a scam, but it might turn out to be the largest bitcoin scam we have/will see in bitcoin history.
@_date: 2014-04-11 15:22:43
While it may be some "... biggest indicator of a bright future for Bitcoin..."
it is in no way an indicator of a rising bitcoin price.
But I agree it might indicate that we are on the right way to mass adoption and at the same time to a more stable bitcoin price.
However, each time someone pays using bitcoin, the online merchant who accepts bitcoin, converts them in almost all cases immediately to fiat - thus, paying with bitcoin is like selling them for fiat on an exchange.
That's keeps bitcoin price from rising, as more btc are available on the market.
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:58:15
I am looking forward to read something like this:
Bitcoin price had been stuck at US$999 +/- $9 for 9weeks
@_date: 2014-09-20 22:23:29
And now think a step further:
What IF one or more "bitcoin hater(s)" (person/group/institution/Gov/ you name it) got control over privKeys of a few of these addresses ?
1i7cZdoE9NcHSdAL5eGjmTJbBVqeQDwgw = 144,341.53393243 BTC
this one everyone knows.
Think for a moment, that a large bank like Deutsche Bank would get it's hands on those priv keys. What exactly would you do if you where that bank? 
And what exactly would average Joe think about that?
It's safe to assume that Bankers are about to see/understand the potential influence of what bitcoin would bring to all of us. And it's a no brainer for a typical Bankster to do everything in his power to avoid being kicked in the ass but better kill the child in its earliest infancy.
This is why I am saying: Only a few people ( a smaller group than the FED ) knowing these privKeys are in control.
privKeys in hands of bitcoin haters - potential dangerous
privKeys in hands of bitcoin lovers - potential less dangerous but still annoying
Who is with me?
@_date: 2014-04-11 15:39:54
I personally try to focus on the many advantages Bitcoin brings me, compared to other payment methods.
I like (as many of us) it's pseudo-anonymity.
I like to be more in control, and I am while using Bitcoin.
I do my own risk management and like to be responsible for my own decisions, without being backed by any form of guarantee issued by a centrally controlling institution. That means, on that way I will do mistakes and pay for them. That's how life is.
I am full in for Bitcoin - if it's price is $10 or $10k

For me, this is the moment to BUY IN - a kinda once in a life time opportunity

Same here I never used gox. My guess is there is nothing much what can be done at this point. Users lost hell of a lots of bitcoin and are gonna loose more. My prediction: Eventually gox will stop working soon. Soon everyone is going to try to take out there btc from gox, what triggers the endgame.
I am so sorry for all those people who are going to loose.

That does make sense. I personally feel the German way to look at bitcoin as a "kind of private money" is quite Pro-Bitcoin.

If that is true he has put himself to a certain amount in control of the market. He can use it to manipulate exchange rates to it's own advantage. I am not saying I believe he is that kind of person who would do that, and to be honest we all can only guess of who he is and what drives him and his mind.
I also would like to know if he could have foreseen the adoption of bitcoin after "only" 4 years, and which ( if any ) other option he has to control the bitcoin market or it's network.
Just always thinking about it.
