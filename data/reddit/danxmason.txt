Physical cash is fine until you need to use a bank. Bail-ins confiscate money in banks.
Many people own bitcoins, it's very easy to get them with goods and services.
I wouldn't say the crash was due to inflation. It's just volatility. Inflation would be that twice the number if bitcoins suddenly appeared causing the price to go in half.

Cash in banks. Cash on hand is fine until you need to use a bank.
@_date: 2015-06-30 14:20:36
How else do you transfer your cash? Fed-ex?
@_date: 2015-06-30 14:04:18
Euros won't inflate, whatever money Greece prints when it is kicked off the euro will. Government bail ins mean confiscating bank money. Euros under the mattress are fine until you need to use a bank.

Yeah something along the lines of... "My fellow Americans, bitcoin is used by terrorists to fund terrorism all across the planet. And criminals are using it to launder money for drugs and sex traffic. Join me in ending bitcoin once and for all to keep America safe and secure for everyone. God bless America."

I disagree completely. If they have cash Bitcoin is necessary because it cannot be hyperinflated or confiscated by banks. If they don't have cash, they can sell goods and services to attain it.

I don't get it
@_date: 2014-04-28 04:53:05
I thought doge coin was a satirical nonexistent currency?
@_date: 2015-01-07 20:41:33
Debt-based central fiat will always be the best option to maintain control for private central banks. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 11:42:35
This is assuming the central banks aren't completely corrupt... Which they are.
@_date: 2013-04-14 10:34:37
Wow an anti-fed article in the msm. I'm shocked and impressed.
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:13:07
It's also easy to fake in an every day market.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:30:13
Are any of these HFT-proof?
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:26:50
All fiat currency is virtual.
@_date: 2013-07-11 21:12:40
The only thing I still don't understand is how a wallet is protected. If the block chain has every address stored, how do you keep people from hacking it?
@_date: 2013-11-17 09:25:00
Bitcoin will be pegged to precious metals.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:41:22
The reason btc has problems right now is because people are trading them like stocks. So thank you for your support.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:06:34
You don't, but your comment does.
@_date: 2013-04-14 05:05:37
Yes. I guarantee the first BTC-exchange that is HFT-proof will get ALL business-related transactions. Not even a question. Easy way to get rich.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:24:32
Hft is good for some people and not others. Restriction should be there for people who want it. That's the whole point of a free market.
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:25:00
Who cares?
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:34:39
Bit coin is as real money as any fiat. However, it is not stable money. Once it's stable, people won't worry about converting it.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:31:52
False. The free market system means government does not regulate the system. Private enterprises are free to regulate their own business however they see fit. The people are free to choose any exchange they like. They can choose an exchange that limits hft or they can choose the hundreds of other exchanges that don't.
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:01:03
Free market means businesses are allowed to run their own business however they want. If a bitcoin exchange wants to only let black people trade, that's their right in a free market. A single blacks-only exchange does not restrict the free market. Nor would an Anti-HFT exchange restrict the free market.
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:08:48
Can someone explain this like I've had a brain injury?
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:45:47
That reminds me of the DuckTales episode about inflation. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:35:52
Given the vulnerability every trading site has shown over the past 2 days, the first person to make a hft-proof exchange will be rich.
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:58:22
If you can immediately cash to any currency you want, why does it matter when it stabilizes?
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:26:17
You don't understand what a free market is.
@_date: 2013-07-11 21:25:28
Yeah. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:56:08
There is no actual price. Money is just collective madness.
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:30:55
How do I get this software to accept bitcoins as payment?
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:38:14
I like it. A black market for organic food.
@_date: 2013-04-14 06:49:01
How so? People are free to switch exchanges any time they wish.
@_date: 2013-11-17 09:07:43
They can make them illegal but I don't see how they can make them worthless.
@_date: 2013-11-17 08:51:48
What's coin validation?
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:09:40
More importantly why isn't there a single exchange that is hft resistant?
