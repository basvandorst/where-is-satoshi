Wow...I just took a screenshot of this. Have you broken some kind of mind control?
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:17:27
Oh, fuck me. First btc-e and now this??
@_date: 2017-08-04 21:15:13
Its rockin?
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:29:39
I hope this isn't related to their recent change to their TOS
@_date: 2017-08-07 19:43:30
LMAO...the irony!

Big Block HF starts on Aug 1 regardless of whether bip148 triggers.
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:17:58
You're the only one who doesn't seem to get it: 
@_date: 2017-07-23 16:56:33
LMAO...so butthurt that you're in denial.
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:53:17
Yeah, its called "theft".
@_date: 2017-07-27 18:59:31


@_date: 2017-07-26 02:52:21
People might like the idea of lower fees.
@_date: 2017-07-22 20:16:20
legacy blocks are rejected by bitcoin-abc starting Aug 1 because they are not over 1MB. Don't worry, bitcoincash blocks will be mined plenty
@_date: 2017-07-30 10:21:11
I actually predicted Coinbase would do this. They wanna steal that Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:03:39
Economic majority says you're wrong.
@_date: 2017-06-22 21:35:40
what makes those spam?
@_date: 2017-06-23 03:41:12
hmmm...will this post be allowed to be seen?
@_date: 2017-06-30 23:32:32
LOL...the salty tears in this sub are delicious!!!
@_date: 2017-06-23 05:06:50


Sure they would. People break the law every minute of everyday. And making something illegal ALWAYS raises the price due to risk. 
But again, for the reasons I posted earlier, that will never happen.
They can say people owe taxes, but its mostly unenforceable to anyone who wants to avoid it.
@_date: 2017-06-10 15:47:22
Yes!! UASF! I totally support you forking off.
@_date: 2017-06-27 17:10:52
I find it highly unlikely that you, or anyone else in this sub, has any idea about the details of patent law. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 03:36:50
Despite not having any evidence to support this statement.
@_date: 2017-06-22 20:21:15
How is that determined? 
@_date: 2017-06-10 15:55:10
No seriously. If you really believe SegWit is the best scaling solution you should fork - even with minority hashpower. Because if SegWit is the right answer, your coin will outperform on the exchanges and miners will switch to the SegWit coin. If you're wrong, however, it will be useless and die from miners leaving.
@_date: 2017-06-05 14:25:31
Governments always had enough money (limitless) to make a 51% attack. But then what? If they did anything obvious the network would fork from them.
@_date: 2017-06-22 21:30:40
What makes that spam?
@_date: 2017-06-23 18:57:59
you know you're right when the person you're debating resorts to nothing but ad hominem, right?
@_date: 2017-07-26 14:27:33
Surprised this isn't bigger news. BTC-e is the oldest of the current exchanges - been around since 2011. 
...fuckin governments
@_date: 2017-06-23 04:08:16
yeah, but you won't be able to use the bitcoin blockchain due to the fees. You'll only be able to use Blockstreams side chains which will require AML/KYC just like Coinbase does.
@_date: 2017-06-23 05:27:34
I did
@_date: 2017-06-16 06:54:52
LMAO...only people afraid of a chain split are the people who  fear having less hashpower.
@_date: 2017-06-10 21:22:51
good riddance
@_date: 2017-06-27 15:42:53
I can't tell if this is FUD or not, but it seems too risky just to fix tx malleability.
@_date: 2017-06-23 04:57:00
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:28:21
@_date: 2017-06-22 20:51:35
So limiting the block chain makes it harder for spam attacks to clog the network? That makes no sense at all.
@_date: 2017-06-22 21:01:55


You make this comment without having a clear definition of what spam is.
@_date: 2017-06-23 04:54:33


They could have done that already. The reason they didn't is that it would only make the price rise even faster, which combined with educating people that it is illegal, would boost its popularity even more, which would in turn reveal how desperate they are to control the currency to everyone


They can't tax it now. Something like 1% of Coinbase customers actually reported their bitcoin earnings. That doesn't include all the other people who bought using more anonymous methods. Not to mention, they don't really have jurisdiction anyway.
@_date: 2017-06-23 18:56:40
source is common sense.
@_date: 2017-06-20 03:37:55
Every country in the world has the bandwidth necessary for 20MB blocks.
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:31:07
I go to websites that use up more bandwidth all the time. Quit frontin.
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:30:34
The link you sent is pure nonsense. You bought into that crap?
@_date: 2017-06-10 15:26:59
Code for mining bigger blocks? That can be done by changing a &gt; to a &lt;, you retard!
