Every exchange is by vulnerable by hacks and insiders.   Period.  Always will be.  Buy/sell from an exchange and store yourself, either paper wallets or hardware like a Trezzor.   
Online wallet with a small amount for daily spending.

Is blockchain still used much?

Ouch,  
In my case, I don’t mind waiting.  I consider it storage (once I learned about mem pool and unconfirmed transactions). My coin is still mine, just in limbo atm.  Lightning will soon be implemented and off chain transactions will alleviate these problems we are having. 
Right?

I was just watching “The Best Documentary Ever-The Bitcoin Phenomenon” on YouTube, and I was suddenly struck with the thought that someday (soon?) we will pass the DOW.   It is just a number, but I remember in 2013, when we passed gold, It was a big deal.  
Look how far we have come, and we are just getting started.

Update:  my coin was returned last night.  Shows no transaction in log, s if it never happened.   Is there a default timeframe for cancellation?

Google Ponzi.  Needs new investors to pay dividens to older investors for it to be a Ponzi. 
Bitcoin does not classify.  Every investor has same amount of $ per BTC.  Actually, with new investors, prices rises.
Delet this post and make a new one with accurate info if you want BTC community to support.

If you are on the correct site, the generating is done client side.  No dada base to crack.
Assuming you trust the site, and so far they have never had a problem, you are the only one to ever have seen the keys.  
Theoretically someone could make a site with pregenerated keys and distribute the as if random. Watch the wallets and when you have enough BTC in paper wallets, import.  Then many people will post warning about that site.  Paperwallets.com has never had any issues.

He is correct though.  Halving is based on number of blocks.  If we are constantly solving blocks at 8min the halving would happen 20% faster.  If the hash rate keeps increasing (which will, with new tech and new miners) the difficult adjustment may not be able to keep up.  I don't know why he is being down voted.  It's fact.  Question is, whether it will make a difference in the long run.  There are no 12 min blocks to make up for the 8 min ones.

You can't make an "anonymous post" declaring unspecific accusations.  What is the purpose of this post?  Not to inform as you haven't said anything except general FUD, not to "come clean" as you are using a throwaway...Just a long post that says nothing.  
Post proof, at least of who you are,  or you are wasting our time.
At least we know who 2bit is.
@_date: 2014-03-01 22:07:16
Ty for explaining this simply!
Is the actual time for new blocks 15min in the protocol? When then say approx every 10 min, is that because the difficulty is always increasing and it is closer to 10 min in reality?

It is more likely that we would get Satoshi Nakamoto to talk before Karpeles.

I have an IPhone, this is what I do.
-Open Bitcoin acct on computer
-Go to my wallets, find import private key
-Enter private key from paper manually or scan with webcam.
-after confirmations you will have that wallet with funds. You should then open that wallet and send all BTC to a safer wallet, I use the blockchain app on iPhone for regular bitcoining.  I send my "savings" BTC to a paper wallet that I can set to "watch only" (you just enter public key, not enter private key).

"I consider myself a Bitcoin entrepreneur first and foremost"
Didn't you publicly announce you sold all your Bitcoin?  I've always been a fan of TBI but I was disappointed to hear you say that.  I understand you wanted to keep your own solvency but to sell all BTC doesn't show faith.
Regardless, keep up the good work Ryan!

That is for debit deposit, $50 max.   You can deposit any amount with proper verification lvl  I use CaVirtex all the time, it is excellent!
@_date: 2016-01-16 07:47:38
Agreed. I did the same.  Lost half my coins when I panick sold when I dropped in '13.  I was new.   I've learned so much since then.  I'm in it for the long haul.  Mike sold out.   I appreciate all he did in the past, but his "great reveal" is just to promote FUD.  The 11 coins I have are for my kids.  Tech is solid, people are fragile.

Thanks, I've heard good things.   CaVirtex was awesome.   I would get a personal email or even a phone call if I had a problem with deposits.  I'm surprised Kraken has yet to respond.   I even posted in r/Kraken for help.   
I ended up buying 2 More at a machine ugh.   
@_date: 2016-06-13 23:58:34
Is that why your support still hasn't got back to me regarding deposit problems?   I'm tier 3 verified.   Been 6 days I keep emailing and opening support tickets.   
I'm so frustrated that I'm anxiously waiting for Quadriga to verify me.

It won't go lower than post GOX lvls.  Truthfully, the actual price for it's value 
Is around $500 ATM.  Two steps forward,1 and 3/4 steps back.   Bitcoin price is stable if you look year to year.  
personally I like the down trends.  Allows me time to acquire more.   Almost 21 now.
EDIT: I originally wrote "HOLD".   Sorry
@_date: 2016-06-14 02:38:49
I do not get the option to deposit. It says to contact support if option not shown.   I was tier 3 with Cavirtex for a long time.  Never a problem.  
@_date: 2016-06-14 03:42:00
It does not have the option to Upload documents.   Status says "pending".  FAQs says if no option to download then means either am verified or pending.

Ya I took me to come to Reddit to get some action with kraken.   In the meantime I signed up with Quadriga.  Very pleased with the service.   
Imo, since Kraken took over CaVirtex, the customer service has gone down hill.  They are too busy with GOX claims.

Excellent post.  This would make the big banks want to get into the BTC market.  As adoption grows, the big banks will either try to stifle it or they will get on board.  If there is profit to be made and it is what their customers want...they will create the service to accommodate.

Learn about the current state mining.  You will not get any bitcoins unless you have 100k mining set up.
You can't get fractions of coins.  You have to win the whole block.  You can join a mining guild but even then you will not get anything :(
The days of solo BTC mining are over.  
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:10:24
I spent 4k on LBC.  No problems.  First time I met someone in person for .3 BTC, next I depo'd $into someone's Bank account.  If you choose someone with a lot of trade history, you are safe.  They make more $ doing trades, than (then?)  ripping people off.
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:24:32
What if someone or some government put one block worth of coins into its own wallet for several years.  Had compute programs to keep track of keys.  Then when BTC gets to 1,000,000 come in and buy everything.  Perhaps this is the next plan for a "new world order".  I have BTC and am excited for the future but part of me is worried that a group could have 30% of the coins.  
38,000 wallets x 50 =1.9 mil BTC x $1,000,000 = $1.9 trillion
