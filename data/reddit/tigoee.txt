Not today Satan.

My address may not have been segwit though. My address starts with a 1 and not a 3. I thought starting with a 1 meant it was segwig but I guess it really isnt.

Great article I hadn’t seen before. Thanks for the post!
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:50:39
This big dumb idiot didn’t refresh clearly
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:29:25
Yes. Its called arbitrage. Supply and demand amongst exchanges sometimes causes this differentiation in prices. 
FWIW: Just bought more on gemini while it was 400 dollars lower on it.

I would mention the immense growth potential in the space and really explain why this is a great reason that truly buying anytime under 20k at this point is a great idea. 
I would say that this is the beginning of a generational market and most bitcoin owners/buyers/sellers aren’t even born yet. 
People get scared by the chart and the high prices when it comes to putting their hard earned money on the line (especially certain non-tech savvy risk-averse parents that have already lived more than half of their life one way and feel they don’t need to radically shift their day to day comforts). 
Explain how the market cap is truly so so so so minuscule compared to the global economic market and how the % of all bitcoin users globally has to still be around 10-15% of people and that could be a high valuation. There’s room to grow but if you can explain why the chart isn’t so scary by the growth potential in the space you might have luck. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:08:56
Doubtful. If there was going to be a big drop from 10-11 back to 7k it would have happened the last 3 days IMHO. Nobody wants to sell at 10k anymore 
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:55:53
be a bitcoin maximalist.
If you're not a trader and still want to look up some alts that you feel could have potential in the space going forward, read a couple of white pages, and then go from there.
bitcoin is the market leader and driver though.

Just recently moved money into bittrex and went through the entire verification process as asked. These requirements are pretty universal now for all exchanges. I also thought they did a good job of making it known that I couldn’t withdraw anything until after verification to begin with
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:00:01
You're all great people. Thanks for the help and this site is great!

Realized electrum wallet is not segwit. I just am confused why coinbase would alter the alter to receive too and leave most of the address identical.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:57:51
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:56:44
There won’t be a drop with you keeping this run alive! 
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:44:18
I bought more today too. HODL!
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:46:50
I like HODL = Hold on for dear life
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:12:12
Gemini. Also look into understanding how GDAX is Coinbase exchange and you won’t get destroyed by fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:04:55
Clearly some sort of bot buy spamming but why would they buy in pieces like that? That makes no sense. Can you explain why you think its super normal?
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:11:32
Kraken is an exchange and not a wallet. Please do not keep your internet savings in the hands of an exchange. Do more research if needed. 
Also - I use electrum for the time being 
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:54:52
I like using Gemini personally. Easy verification and 0.25% fees are good enough for me. Never had any problems. Also use Coinbase/GDAX/bittrex. But Gemini is a great place for starting. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:55:22
Yes all sells of any crypto are taxable events. If you use any sort of shapeshifter to change from an alt back to bitcoin you do not have to eventually pay taxes until you finally liquidate the bitcoin. 
If you hold X,Y, Z alts on bittrex and sell them and buy more bitcoin- X,Y,Z sells are all taxable if you make a profit. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:03:29
thank you for your help and speed of answering. I really appreciate it 
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:15:02
You’re crazy if you think people are going to read this. Thanks for your effort though. Brief skim
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:55:56
how are you certain? sorry if its an annoying question to ask. I have moved coins in and out and its never done such a thing before?
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:11:33
You learn something new every day. This is interesting. Thanks for the response. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:02:36
Thought new weeks started on sundays?

This is amazing news. From my understanding they are now almost a year ahead of schedule on LN if not even sooner with this news. Amazing
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:17:04
What type of OS are you running? Sorry OP :(
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:14:02
We will be alright. Consolidations lead to further bull runs. Don't drop the baby.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:25:18
I appreciated this post. I feel like I should see this more often in here, but never do. Thanks for the laughs friend
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:35:44
It means exactly what they say. All the exchanges are doing their best and not trying to get burned by any sort of fraud right now or they risk their entire business as bitcoin enters the mainstream. 
All sales are taxable events that you “should” report on income gains if applicable. 
There are know your client rules that makes something like an ID verification almost mandatory for any sort of company that is involved in any trading space.

HODL off the exchange and you wont have to deal with exchanges freezing. Sell whenever you arrive at your personal moon. Good luck friend.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:20:19
do you know why they slightly alter the beginning of the address?
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:30:02
My address started with a 1, but every time he would directly copy and paste my address starting with a 1 into his send address, coinbase would remove a couple of the initial characters. The last 75% of the address remained the same though.
Any thoughts?

Weak hands gunna lose you money. HODL.

I love using gemini personally

Underrated comment of the year. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:48:39
I’m cool with 50% of this years gains for 2018. Anyone else? I’m even cool with 20%. Show me a strong 2018. New tactic is to tell people their unborn kids will be buying bitcoin one day and then something finally clicks in their heads. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:51:22
Personally I use Electrum wallet and buy and HODL BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:13:42
I read the entire post- which I don't always do on here. You have a gift for writing. This was extremely easy to read and the points were well fleshed out. Valuable piece and thanks for the thoughts. 
My two satoshis is simply- bubbles have the potential to last a long long time. If we grant credence to some of your points, you very well know that this rollercoaster may be far from a potential ceiling. If some of these points are true, 10,000 can be an extremely early time to liquidate. 
The piece shows the value and importance of blockchain moving forward in this world. Large part of how the technology will advance will come from the devs and the teams who will put in the long and hard hours towards improvement. Personally, I'm betting that the teams behind improvement will be much more successful working with Bitcoin for the immediate future. You can post this same article when bitcoin hits 20,000. 10,000 is too early IMHO.

Not sure your age, but look into restaurant business. Serving/bussing/bar-tending all cash business when you walk out the door. It’s hard work though but if you’re trying to grind-this is it.

hey where do you find your buy/sell walls? I only know to check bitstamp for buy/sell walls, but curious if you look on multiple exchanges to get a more rounded idea. thanks!
