I was 20 at the time - the rest of my assets were contained on my university meal card.

I think I misunderstood you too - it's all good.

The currency is programmed to achieve 100 billion Doge in circulation by the end of 2014, with 5 billion new Dogecoin to be minted every year thereafter to replace lost currency (i.e. destroyed wallets) and so forth.
Part of that design was intended to ensure that by the time scrypt ASIC miners arrive on the market that they won't be able to accumulate large portions of the initial coin, but still be available to help validate transactions as the network grows.

This is exactly right - there is no "statute of limitation" against capital losses, but you can only claim up to $3000 in losses per year. There is definitely a fixed cap to capital losses.

Oh yeah, I get it know - I was naive enough at 20 to believe they had my best interests in mind.

Agree. It would be nonsensical to require a balance sheet as the corporation is being set up, since it would contain zero assets unless it's an S-Corp or LLC converting to one.
That being said, AFTER that shit is set up in the US there's a lot of legal stuff that forces you down the route of accountability. Multiple authorizers required for writing checks, corporate governance, quarterly tax filings, etc... Running a C-corp isn't lightweight.

I'm not a sophisticated enough investor to know what that even means today, let alone when I was 20 years old and made the original investment :)

Cool, thanks for sharing - I liquidated most of my stuff in 2012 (not accounting for the inflation over those 6 years, which was considerable) in order to put together pay myself a salary while I started my company. Looks like the value was break-even if it was 100% in an index fund (it wasn't - I have no idea what the financial managers were doing.)
Should note - virtually 100% of those gains you cited occurred within the last year.

Ummm.... no? Isn't that what my franchise fee, business license, quarterly, and annual taxes are for?

Watching journalists discuss anything technical feels like watching ferrets trying to discuss quantum mechanics.

Live and learn. I was 20 at the time - inherited a sizable but not life-changing amount of money from the sale of my late grandmother's house.
I put it into the hands of a professional financial advisers and I asked for an aggressive growth portfolio, and she did as I asked. Lost 40% of the value by January 2009 and it still would not have recovered to its original value today if I left it untouched.
The valuable lessons I learned: 
* financial advisers aren't nearly as useful or wise as they claim to be; in hindsight, any idiot could have seen that the Dow and NASDAQ couldn't sustain their record high levels at the time. NASDAQ and Dow are approaching 2007 levels this year - so I sure as shit won't be investing in them again this time. They're due for a downward correction.
* there are no such things as financial perpetual motion machines, including index funds. Had I invested solely in a NASDAQ / NYSE / DOW index fund then, I would still not have made a positive return over those years, and that's without accounting for inflation and time / value of money.
edit: worth noting - I used what was left of this money to finance my startup, which employs a few people now and is growing. I'm a much riskier investment than Bitcoin or stocks, but at least I have a say in what happens :)

I should also point out, per my last comment: it's worth that NOW. It might not be next year and wasn't before 2013.
So when people say "just put it in an index fund and you'll see returns" you have take into account the opportunity cost of when you need to exercise those returns for something.
In my case, I had to eat the loss in order to stop working for other people.
Your case might be different - you might need to eat it for a down payment on a house. Or maybe college for a kid. Who knows?
The point being: "just put your money into an index fund" is just as simplistic and blissfully stupid as believing in Bitcoin's value to always increase as though it's October / November 2013 year-round. You can lose it all and not have it when you need it, even in an index.
