They wanted transaction surveillance software so they bought they best they could find. Who could have guessed the best people at surveillance are malicious creepy bad actors?

Coinbase isn't that bad... sure, their customer service takes forever, their trading platform sucks during peak loads, you actually have to pay taxes on gains etc... but that's the price you pay for regulation, which has many other benefits that give peace of mind to the less technically inclined.

Thanks, but just imagine how much the world would suck if there were no weird people. Like, none at all. Imagine the boredom and social pressure to perform. Then you say one weird sentence at a party and everyone turns at you and points as their jaws unhinge and an otherworldly squealing shriek makes your ears bleed as your consciousness fades and the last thing you see is them descending on you like social piranhas... I don't want to live in that world, no sir.

"Nothing, just that guy trading on margin over there... I saw one just like it."

First you want to get six large AA grade eggs and separate the whites from the yolks. Then, pour all the yolks into your pants and the whites on your face while trying to shout SEGWITSEGWITSEGWITSEGIT as many times as you can before the police remove you from the Cinnabon.
