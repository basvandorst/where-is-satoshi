I agree you should check out join market. Here is the subreddit:

Merry Christmas!!

I'm having problems with this when I am testing this out with a friend.
When I sent 1uBTC to my friend, it says it's sent. I got a 10uBTC bonus for sending. It shows up on the list of transactions, but my friend said he never got it. (His balance did not go up)
I'm not even sure how to debug it. I send the 1uBTC via a link that he gave me, so I don't think it was sent to the wrong place.

Just got my 0.01BTC. Thanks!

That's a good one that you bringing up. You are referring to this: 
The Fifth Postulate is needed for Euclidean Geometry. The interesting part is that it's likely that our universe is not flat! (It's pretty flat though)
What I am trying to say is that you can have different set of axioms, and you will have a different set of consequences. All of them are still "math".

I don't think I agree with you that a black hole will be disastrous. If the mass of the black hole is small enough it's unlikely it will interact with any other matter.

Perhaps another way of putting it is that math is the same in this universe or another one, while science is investigating the universe that we live in.
For example, you can have another universe where the laws of physics are different. Maybe instead of having four fundamental forces, you only have three. What science can discover in that world would be very different than this.
However, you would make the same discoveries in math in both.

Go above $700 next?
@_date: 2014-05-10 11:35:38
Woot, 300k!
@_date: 2014-07-21 22:47:54
how come that reads like a press release
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:30:15
Happy cake day you kind sir!
@_date: 2014-06-16 20:51:17
Woo hoo, I want bits!
@_date: 2014-03-13 01:17:37
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-05-08 19:34:58
Hopefully I'm not too late!

Sorry, I was only trained as a mathematician instead of a scientist.

It's up to you to decide whether or not FDIC will protect you. I'm just pointing out that the first $250,000 is covered under the scheme, not $200,000.
@_date: 2015-01-05 15:08:51
That is correct, SIPC protects your trading accounts instead: 
@_date: 2015-01-05 16:02:31
The savings are insured up to $250,000, not $200,000.

Well, it doesn't have to be a rollback. How about what ethereum is actually doing with this: 
What is to stop bitcoin to do the same? It seems crazy to me that ehtereum is going to allow miners to add a list of code hashes to ignore.

yay, "vol of vol" is mentioned.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:54:59
I don't think you guys mean the same thing when you say "work for".
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:00:41
Practically speaking, no. Most major companies do not offer cash discounts. Many smaller shops do though.
It has been brought up many times on this thread already though, Gyft is currently offering a 3% discount for buying gyftcards using bitcoins. Since you can buy gyftcards for big companies like Amazon and Target, I think that addresses your point?
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:20:04
Hmmm, did you just tip the guy 2.5BTC?
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:56:23
Wow that's very generous of you. Thank you very much!
@_date: 2013-10-31 16:41:34
What about this? 
It seems to have better return than JD? I'm not sure if I am calculating return correctly.
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:36:33
Honest question though, how much hashpower is needed?
Let's say the amount of desired hashpower is X. If there is 2X the hashpower right now, that will just make the difficulty higher right? Hashpower is being wasted. If this is the case, it would be nice to lower the transaction cost. Otherwise you are paying for hashpower that you don't need.
I don't know what X is though. So how much hashpower do we need?
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:13:41
Okay, thanks for that additional info.
I understand it's a risky business. However, they could have contacted me sooner if they thought that it looks suspicious. They also don't have to cancel the transaction. They can say the transaction is on hold until I provide further information.
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:41:17
Okay, nice to know this is an isolated incident. Thank you!
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:38:07
I have never gotten tipped before : (
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:38:47
Merchants are allowed to have "cash discounts". I think you are thinking of "credit card surcharge". (I know mathematically they are the same thing, but one is banned and the other is allowed)
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:40:46
Thanks, going through the posts were helpful. I will work with coinbase support to resolve this.
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:41:37
Okay, nice to know you have had good experience with them.
@_date: 2013-11-08 18:54:35
Thanks for that. Yeah, I was feeling the same which is why I made the post. I have calmed down a lot since then.
@_date: 2013-10-31 17:16:23
Thank you for all that information you kind sir.
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:01:02
I'll refer you to this:

I don't know who downvoted you. That's where I have my bitcoins invested currently.
I assume you don't mean that I should go gamble my BTC, but rather invest it.
I was hoping there is something similar so I can diversify my bitcoin investments.
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:53:22
Okay, thanks for the context. I think the only difference is that I did the test deposits. I can see how that may be considered to be riskier.
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:52:05
All the people that I know who hold bitcoins tell me they just hoard them. What are some of the ways to invest those bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-11-12 22:35:52
I agree that nobody should invest in anything they don't understand.
Doesn't mean that you tell other people not to invest in it.
