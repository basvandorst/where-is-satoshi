This is where you are wrong: competition doesn't mean a product will die/won't be as valuable as before/ won't go up in price. 
Market share: market share going down doesn't imply low value/drop in price


It's up to them to develop such a product. Let them develop it and we'll talk.
I'm not a bitcoin expert and I know nothing about its technical aspects, but your arguments don't make sense.

Whales are just like normal users. They have risky assets just like you, but in more quantity. I don't get how they can "control" the market. Can someone explain to me?

Long ago, a group daily-traders and investors were mad because they couldn't predict where to invest and when to buy/sell to earn good money. Tired of getting very average returns, one member had the greatest idea ever:
+*Hey, what about we say we have huge return rates and tell people we have a technique that will give them amazing returns and make them pay for our knowledge?*
-*But that's bullshit. Our returns are average at best. These techniques don't mean anything and our prediction success is at lower than 50 perc-*
+*Shut up already. And with the money we make from selling our knowledge, we'll appear more succesful, and thus we will be able to sell even more knowledge because, well, people will see that our knowledge works"*
-*Yeah, I get the point. Let's get to work*
And Technical Analysis was born.

Correction... What? Correction, like any indicator that is part of "technical analysis" is as trustworthy as a big horse shit lying in the middle of the street. It's disgusting to see so many people following a "science" that is backed up by nothing (yes, nothing) and as effective as letting your 4 year old kid choose where to invest.

I don't think 800 bitcoins mean anything when the trade volume far exceeds that
