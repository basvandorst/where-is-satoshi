The trick is to just smoke weed so ur not so stressed all the time and u can fall asleep easy too. Plus weed is definitely better for u than sleeping pills are

I’m from Canada so there’s kind of limited options as to websites that actually work here and that actually accept the bank I use so ya. Coinmama has worked many times for me and the transactions are usually pretty quick, though the fees are pretty high, also the verification process doesn’t take very long and u only need ID. Quadrigaxc and binance are also good, but quadriga takes a while to get verified and binance u can only trade with other coins if ur from Canada. Coin base has never worked for me at all (not really sure why), and I’ve also heard u can only buy stuff on coin base in Canada and u can’t sell anything.

They might have been talking about bitcoin cash which most people in this subreddit consider to be a scam as well

Ya lol I’m invested in a bunch of cryptocurrencies and I have literally no idea what any of them do or how hey work. All I know is that they keep going up in price and that I’m making money off of them.

No it definitely wasn’t true it said he made like 1 mill from selling chuck e cheese tokens and I’m pretty sure people are not that stupid. It was probably from the onion or something

I really feel like this guy should be getting reported on twitter for attempting to scam people, regardless of the fact that you’d have to be retarded to fall for this scam. He was still trying to scam people out of their btc by tricking them into feeling bad for him. This is the kinda thing that gives bitcoin and other cryptos a bad name ..

Try binance maybe I’ve found that was the quickest website to setup and trade for alt coins 
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:40:07
At this point if I could get to .1 of a bit coin I would be happy 
@_date: 2019-12-26 04:05:14
You also could have lost everything if u didn’t sell the bitcoin at the perfect time, complete shitpost

I’d guess it’s just Putin trying to show off to the world. Obviously the election is going to be rigged again like it always is and Putin will win if he wants to.

She posted it on her twitter that has 77mill followers.

Question about BNB for trading, I’ve been thinking about doing this for a while and just wondering how many do I really need to get to cover fees in binance for a while? Like would just 1 be fine or do you need a decent amount.

Lol John Mcaffee wishes he has an audience this big to shill.

Cuz that’s what it costs in the US lol. If this kid were from Europe this wouldn’t even be a story, he coulda went to school for free and still had all his Bitcoin.
