yes, but you'd pass out and start breathing again first.
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:42:42
it's not a cycle.
@_date: 2017-07-25 03:48:12
depends on how you define violence.
@_date: 2017-07-26 10:54:15
the train analogy confused me
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:26:54
I tried to do the same, literally right down at 1900; but living in shitty New Zealand, the only reliable way of buying means I won't get my bitcoin until sometime on Friday or Saturday, at whatever price it's at then.
@_date: 2017-07-25 03:47:45
fear has driven people crazy. again.
@_date: 2017-07-31 10:10:07

@_date: 2017-07-18 20:06:53
So long as he doesn't hilt.

Two hours to go in New Zealand, so I'll let you guys know.
My prediction so far: nothing different.
@_date: 2017-07-26 23:34:42
@_date: 2017-07-24 10:15:41
so change your own life and buy one.
@_date: 2017-07-19 00:05:12
And when Bitcoin goes to the moon, she'll give you shit about not buying more.
@_date: 2017-07-26 01:59:20
because wishes come true.
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:09:04

@_date: 2017-07-31 10:12:54
0 per cent correct
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:39:57

@_date: 2017-06-15 11:06:02
