Still here, hodling since 2015.

That's how it started for me. One year later my investment became six digits in USD.

"The most surprising thing is that no controls have been put in place by the Bretton Woods Agreement on the amount of U.S. dollars issued."
Can someone elaborate? Afaik the dollar was pegged to gold.

In my humble opinion far too much people look at the price and completely neglect what where the world is going. 
I hodl because I think history will repeat itself again in the upcoming 10/20+ years. Like all currencies the major ones we are using right now (USD/EUR) will eventually blow up through hyperinflation or get replaced by a better/stronger currency. The latter one happend here where I live (The Netherlands, the 'Guilder' got replaced by the Euro). This is simply history repeating itself over and over.
I cannot see how 'paper' money will survive the more and more digitalizing world where we can build whatever we want and are not bound to the laws of nature.

I bet that lady thinks there's actual bitcoin IN the watch, completely clueless.

BCC belongs to BitConnect. I think BSC suits them better: Bitcoin ScamCoin.
BCC is not on Bitfinex, only on ViaBTC, and atm listed for 430$. Probably will be nothing worth in a couple of months.

Hey buddy, i'm willing to help out and remove the clouds.
I'm not obfuscating anything. With L2 scaling I mean layer 2 scaling and without knowing you are using it right now on the TCPIP protocol when being on the internet: When you browse to a website, you don't tell the entire world wide web you want to retrieve the contents of [reddit.com]( but you are exactly asking reddit's servers for the content.
Bitcoin is the first coin out there with this amazing piece of technology. It offloads massive load on the blockchain (L1) and keeps tx's on a layer above until one end of the channel settles. It not only makes tx's cheaper but also instant (as you don't need to wait for a new block to be found).
See it as a 'hot' wallet, a wallet that acts lightning fast. Keep a small amount of BTC in there, everything else in cold storage (which I personally don't call a wallet, but a VAULT).
The amount of development on the protocol and the infrastructure is amazing, no other coin is being backed by this amount of brainpower.
Disruptive technology moves slowly, we don't see disruptive tech often, just every once a generation.

Good decision.
I don't think a lot will happena as well, but if prices dump all the way below 1000$ and people start panicselling at those low prices, I bet a few Exchanges will turn out insolvent (we got hacked etc).

Congratulations mate, you didn't just joined the 21M club, you also left the Bankster world :)
I'm HODLing straight through this 20K-3K crash. Sometimes it hurts a bit but the idea i'm no longer chained to the bankster world gives me a lot of relief.
And the future looks bright, this technology and its development community is amazing!

You haven't done research my friend.
Back in 2009 it was just a few cryptogeeks playing with BTC, and a few years later 1 exchange (Gox). Now we have tons of exchanges, L2 scaling, more development then ever, our 'old' financial infrastructure connecting with Bitcoin (ETFs, Bakkt, Futures) and more and more people reading about it.
You are too impatient. Disruptive technology moves slow and steady. This happend with the microchip, with the personal computer, with the internet, with cell phones and now with a new monetary system.
