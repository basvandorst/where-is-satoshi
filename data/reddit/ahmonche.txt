Bitcoin country is the internet. Buying a country is selfish. Internet already includes everyone, and there is some space left for martians. Welcome to the net, bitcoin nation.

Do not forget where you are. The father of Bitcoin never mention anything about race religion or nationality. I hoped you would try to prioritize evidence over state minds. Less feelings, more thinking. Because we may ending soon in a virtual dociety where you may be allowed to choose parameters which often do not matter like ethnicity, religion, height, tongue's length.

We are changing the governance model. Decentralization mean peer to peer governance. We will not trust noone, but the blockchain. Why do you believe there is single guy somewhere to take good decidions for you? The governance is the blochain. That s the way we have to go. May be within days, or years.....

Tell him that all governments actions or decisions may be disrupted by decentralization. If blockchain governance is accepted, no more single point of failure. A whole bunch of concerned citizens will be able to participate in every single action by voting. No more individual trust, no more privacy about public events. This is going to be a minimum. Well, kind of brain summing. No more voting for individual, voting every day, every hour, as needed, for concrete actions, for decisions. Voting for president? Trust needed.

Core did not setup bitcoin. Satoshi did.
Core invested a lot of money in order to make more money from the bitcoin system.
Satoshi clearly wanted a real opensource system.
Core is managing to kill satoshi's project.
Core is the actual public  enemy, managing to appropriate a public property.

Sure. Odds are satoshi was in fact a new AI experience. We actually have enough hints to reactivate it, so it may help all of us into governance issues.

Better choice is working towards blockchain governance. We have to work hard, but why wait? Why vote on time for dumb individuals, when we may vote as often it is needed? For decisions, not for some guys.

Segwit is an attempt to centralize bitcoin protocol, may be you have some serious reasons to hack someone else work. You are on your way to make people believe that the real value of bitcoin is your sole work, since satoshi disappeared.

That is the point. We need to stop voting for people, they have too many points of failure overtime. We must vote for specific points, so everyone is aware what he is voting for. Voting for human is definitely childish.
