You forgot to watch Boiler Room before jumping into gambling on worthless stocks. 
Also, the best advice I can give, is, when it comes to your hard earned money, never follow anyone's advice.

on the bright side, subway still offers a $3 sub in exchange for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:05:42

You want details? Fine. I drive a Ferrari 355 Cabriolet. What's up? I have a ridiculous house in the South Fork. I have every toy you could possibly imagine. And best of all, kids, I am liquid.

“Bitcoin is not a currency because a currency is supposed to be a stable store of value and the currency that can fluctuate 25% in a day can’t be used for instance to pay wages because wages drop by 25% in a day. It’s a speculation. Based on a misunderstanding.”

"It took both an increasing frequency of Bitcoin-related headlines in mainstream news and the announcement that upcoming online game store Robot Cache intends to use blockchain technology and its own cryptocurrency token to finally pique my curiosity enough to seriously take a look."
When you buy a stock based on reading MSM articles how said stock is making people rich, is the definition of "buying high and selling low" - if you are reading about it in the MSM, time to sell or short the stock.
