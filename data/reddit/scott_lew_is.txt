I just don't understand why core hasn't raised the block size. I've tried to understand core's perspective, but I don't get it. I understand that core would have preferred if segwit was accepted, but why are they still pushing it?

I bet Lyft would be doing a lot better if Uber limited itself to 100 rides/hour.

it is a sucker's bet. the bet can only happen if there is a hardfork. there will only be a hardfork if roger ver likes his odds of succeeding.
you aren't buying the odds of a core "winning" a hard fork if it happens today. you are buying the odds that core wins the hard for conditionally upon BU having the confidence to actually do it. roger ver knows exactly how good the odds will have to seem for roger ver to initiate the hard fork, and no one else does. only a fool would make this bet, no matter what you think of the chances for BTU to become bitcoin.

This link is not directly about bitcoin, but I think it is relevant to the r/bitcoin for three reasons.
1. Roger Ver is asking you to trust him that bitcoin cash is bitcoin. He's also asking that you to trust him that nagacoin is a good place to invest your money. If NAGA can not be trusted, what does that say about his claim that bitcoin cash is bitcoin?
2. Naga group has been buying ad space on r/bitcoin to try to convince the members of this community to back this joke.
3. It is important for the community to understand what roger ver looks for in a crypto project for the next time he tries to sell people on something crazy, like his new nation-state.

signalling segwit is not a moral decision.

everyone is worried about their money. the businesses aren't evil for wanting to do well, even if miners make less money. the miners aren't evil for wanting to make money, even if businesses and users make less money. And users aren't evil for wanting miners and businesses to charge them a whole lot less. 
Regardless of why the litecoin deal happened, I think we can both agree that the litecoin deal would be less likely to have ever happened, if the leaders of the litecoin community spent their time and energy trying to ruin the reputations of the leading miners. Obviously there has been alot of personal attacks throughout the bitcoin scaling process from all directions, but someone has to start the reconciling. maybe its time to start doing that.... bc not doing it is *holding bitcoin back*.

are you worried that the "team" are neither bankers nor fulltime employees of "polybius"
