The public key is a function of the private key, the address is a function of the public key. And yes, one way.

You can hash the address out of the key, so you can send to a public key,,,,,,,,,,,, right?

Very nice start, not, put some numbers on that. "Wall street is interested" ain't gonna cut it for me. Seriously though, put some numbers on it, its a good exercise :) And share it with us. I would love to read your thoughts once they are a LITTLE more developed.

Somebody who manipulates the market is a bad guy too!. As in, market manipulation is on the list of things that a bad guy with 500 mil will do to us. I'm concerned with all of the stuff that a bad person would do, not one thing or the other. 
"How will they use their money and will we be hurt by it?" I really do not care on the exact method. What I do know is, money is power, power could hurt us. Therefore, before I decide to be in a system that gives you power, I have to know that you are not evil. 
Lastly, I'm aware that in bitcoin, the accounts are pseudo anonymous, and that reddit would have it figured out in minutes. But, that does not change the fact that, somebody, who's identity is unknown has lots of money, right now.

This happening will promote BTC adoption, and the price will go up. Why do you think otherwizse.

@_date: 2014-08-25 15:42:35
Couple of openion items. 
* Does anybody not believe that there will be a spike in price soon? if so why? 
* Im bothered by the fact that half of the bitcoins belong to somebody that we do not know who it is. Is this bothering everybody else? 
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:17:41
Im getting the sense that people are bothered by receiving these types of questions. Why?
We often get posts of folks that want to contribute to the community. Explaining events such as this is "contributing to the community".

NO, how dare you sully this pivotal point in history by trivializing the OPS's message to you? Your pontificating tone, and antaganizing rederick deemphasizes the essence of evertying that Bitcoin stands for.

"PayPal is the enemy and goes against what makes btc so great." You gotta qualify your statements before making them  I THINK,,, what you are trying to say is because PayPal is centralized, it makes a natural enemy to BTC. Correct?

Do you think that there will SO much load on the bitcoin network, that we'll start seeing the ball in the miner's court's? where they demand extra fees, or alternative payment structures like monthly subscriptions for the vendors who use them.

Demanding regulations: Usually, companies that have to comply to a government body do NOT want to do so. These reports, and laws take time and money to adhere by. Im not putting my money on PayPal demanding regulations.

1: would take a long time. 
2: more susceptible to brute forcing. Does it make brue forcing likely? no.
3: You should not keep your BTC at a webiste that has this short coming.

vanity private addresses? I did not know those existed. Is'nt that susceptible to guessing with a little bit of social context? Meaning, if I know that bob likes cats, and hates fish, and a combination of these words often in his password, aint I much closer to guessing the private key, then I would have if I was dealing with random numbers?

My $ is still strong (canadian), me and my household do not have an immediate need to switch over. So I save all of my bitcoin more than I hung on to anything else in my life. 
What about encouraging adoption? I have given out atleast half a dozen $10's in BTC to friends. I also paid back people in BTC for money I owed them.

"First they laugh at you, then they ignore you, then they fight you,  then you win" 
We are at 3/4. Knee jerk reaction, business that are using bitcoin are not using BMO to transfer money. BMO do not like that, so they think they can "squash it" easy.

Half of the current bitcoins that were minded in the early stages are stored stale in their original wallet. They belong to what we are all guessing is Satoshi. Thats correct? right?
It would bother me because too much power belongs to a person that I do not know who they are. And I would be supporting this if I get involved.

A person could do lots of very bad stuff with this much money if they intended to. We assume that Statoshi Nakamoto intends well. That assumption scares me.  
Possible Response: Well, you know as much about Nakamoto's intention as you do to Sheik Hamad Bin Khalifa's, and he has lots of money. 
Well, true, but atleast, We know who Hamad bin Khalifa is. If he used his money in evil, we can go after him. But with the anonymity of Nakamoto, that would be more difficult. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 18:10:29
Assuming its true, that does'nt excuse it, or make it less risky. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 16:43:00
I agree with you. Bitcoin, the currancy has issues, lets not forget that half the bitcoins out there are owned by somebody, who's identity is unknown. Why does this not freak other people out?
With that said, the technology is just, amazing. I put my money on Blockchain innovation. And BTC ofcourse, but, with limits.
