Except that Capitalism works even in non-ideal conditions. In every application of Capitalism entrenched in Western Values we see a dramatic increase in quality of life, health, longevity, innovation and technology.
The same cannot be said about socialism. I would disagree with you on the point that socialism has been sabotaged. I would appreciate some further reading on that topic.

Hype and manipulation. A lot of people here seem to be ignoring a lot of the btc related malware atrscks that happens last dec/Jan as well as other criminal activity that coincided with the boom.

Canada and the US are only treating BTC as an investment vehicle because of the actions of BTC users. If users weren't using it as a capital investment vehicle it wouldn't be taxed as such.
All of this "hodl" nonsense is your real enemy.

In nothing.hyper inflation of USD or EUR means significant infrastructure collapse. If you can even access btc no one will have the capability to process payments and convert it to pay suppliers.

Network interruption? Sure, mostly from state-actors.
Data breaches? Less likely on a large scale, but still possible.
I would be far more worried about the correlation between crypto-malware increasing and the sharp price jump we saw last year. There are serious manipulation issues at hand that will keep BTC from mainstream engagement.

It’s almost like it’s ripe for abuse and market manipulation.

Depends on if you mean literally zero, or just a catastrophic crash.
Literal 0? In the short term unlikely unless there is some sort of global legality change.
Major crash to be “practically worthless” for those hodlers from the past few years? Much higher.

It’s been the definition/standard for centuries.
How would you make the distinction?

In what way is this idiocy? They are essentially treating it as bullion which makes sense. Generally speaking tax authorities only apply currency rules to national currencies. To change this will be immensely complex and impact rewards programs.

The assumption that higher interest rates lead to reduced speculation based on borrowing costs.
Its a fallacy. The market drivers aren't homeowners, its speculative investors that are using foreign capital to dyson up real property.

Because fiat currencies are national currencies tied to governments and central banks.
Bitcoin isn’t, and can only be used very selectively for purchasing, much like gold bullion.

Yes but currency can function without electricity, can bitcoin?

I’m curious. For the peepers here who are hodling because they expect global fiat currencies to die, who is going to maintain the infrastructure needed for bitcoin and the internet?
