Yeah I didn't sleep last night, just had like 4 cigars and about 6 red bulls. 
In a hotel away for work, did hardly any work today.

Even at 100K I won't stop putting into btc every pay check

For any investment, get involved in the space. This is a crazy period with even crazier tech. Blockchain has been theorised since WWII and only know has been developed into today from 2009 Satoshi vision. If your interested now, do your due diligence. Yes reddit is a great platform ( you'll find 1000s of posts for help and research) , but you have the entire web to search and look for all this data readily available. Understand the tech, find what you believe in and if you wanna invest still, be prepared for growing balls and tossing away ego.

My plan for the past three years has been to take gains where I can that can influence my life directly; but hold because I really believe in the tech.
Bitcoin and the blockchain tech spoke to a part of me, where I was very mistrusting of the bank system seeing people around me losing there homes due to interest rates while we had a nation low savings interest rate. 
I'm over constitutional money, but for the time being I still get paid in fiat. 
I'm holding my things so eventually I can exchange for goods and property and cars etc.
But selling my holdings for a car isn't going to change my life. 
I've cleared debt, I've been on holidays and I've had some play cash, but I have never touched more than 20% of my holdings to dates. Because I believe this is the future that we need. 
 But to answer your question, no 1 btc will not make you retire. But my first btc changed my life.

Maybe dial up? 
Or sleeping? 
Actually your on the money, yes his retarded.

A marketplace like amazon can push fees into third parties. Steam cannot or better will not

I still see bcash going up a bit on this exchange
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:07:07
In these past few months.  It's getting more and more scarce to find proper comments on these threads.

3. Deposit at any Aus post 
4. Next day buy. 
5. Transfer to ledger.
6. Hold.

Gotta check this out when I get home from work tonight. I hate McAfee but his a calculated asshole. Bullish but yet he does make some points about the need in the economy 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:35:31
I'm not too fussed with that, I feel that steam has been involved in the economy for a while, it will just be looking for a new coin to do what it needed from bitcoin. But in terms of media attention and what's happening now, we will be moving on a different path.

Lucky I didn't buy a Harleythis year. Instead put it in btc. Now I can buy ten Harley's. Waiting for a teslaz

Dollar cost averaging. Don't be a noob. Your emotionally investing. Don't stress. This again will be cheap in 3 months.

Hanks for this. I'm in a hotel for work and been looking for a stream to watch later tonight.l
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:07:00
Have a look at bcash the past 48 hours before the announcement. 
The run up and volume traded was insane, all leads to an obvious insider details leaked 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:18:02
I don't like to follow any rules except the underlying notion that when money is involved there is corruption. I will defend my bitcoin beliefs and it's why I have spread to everyone in my circle to get involved. Because I believe in the revolution, sure these big institutional money cows are going to fuck things, but we don't see the hurt they'll go through later on as the whole market of the world changes. This is 1993 of the internet. Can't wait till this becomes what it was intended for. The people 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:48:40
I think steam has stopped accepting bitcoin due to its volatility. I believe they support the crypto-economy but I believe that a wise business decision in terms of security would be to find another form.
By no means am I an expert.

You need to...

Shouldn’t it be BTCAUD? 
@_date: 2018-10-23 22:52:43
These are what I have bought 
@_date: 2017-08-30 03:30:05
No. Buy.

Amazon and they are touchscreen 
@_date: 2017-08-25 05:08:37
Great way to look at things.  I see it fortunate to adopt this mentality. Not so much the I told you so feels, but mainly about looking at your long term investment goals 
@_date: 2018-06-18 12:46:34
I upvoted. Because well...fuck the system.

I'm in aus. Been using btc markets for 2 years. I BPay straight from my online banking, funds are there within 24 hours, place a limit order and have the btc within a few seconds. 
If you need help, PM me. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:12:23
Looks like the inner west. Good work for us Aussies! Despite the bitcoin involvement, getting a house in your 20s in Sydney is a massive achievement. Happy for you!

I concur. It's going to be a massive adoption year in 2018z 
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:55:15
No just price bought at 
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:07:01
No just buy when you can. In the scheme of the current ATHz bits are really cheap atm. In 6 months this will be different, and you'll have missed this current boat. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:12:15
I didn't even say how much. 
I am all bitcoin. 
For any other reason. I have a little in some alts.
I don't wanna check about bitcoin for a while. I just want to hold like I have in the past. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:20:51
Yeah I was surprised the first time, but it's always been consistent. Been the odd time I've waited 2 days but besides that, alllll gravy

You are doing the right thing, even if you feel like it is a last resort. Sometimes people in life just need people to support and believe in them, we forget how powerful these constitutions are when we don't need them.

I've just come back from Bali. And I got some of my Indonesian friends into bali. They invested 2 million rupiah afteri told them about the technology and they wanted to. 
I truely believe an investment in bitcoin in 2018 will be beneficial even if it's getting involved and understanding the technology. 
@_date: 2017-09-22 22:33:35
I found out about it, cause my best friend got weed on Silk Road. This was year 12 high school, 2009z
Being in Aus we don't really get much choice with any drugs. 
Fast forward 8 years later. I had 2btc on my account that I rediscovered in 2016.
Mean while my friend who showed me Silk Road, I am not entirely sure. But his got a lot of new shit. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 01:35:02
I likea your thinking 
@_date: 2017-09-11 22:17:10
And this was the way cryptocurrencies were only some time ago. 
For me going back to those times, I'm like dam. Only a few years ago, we had drunks tearing themselves up by the pc for a trade they thought was insane. The FUD was real back then, we are about to hit a golden era in the next 5-10 years. And everyone on this sub is going to be happy. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 21:12:37
What app where they using for the transfer? 
@_date: 2019-05-03 15:29:59
Oh dude. How good is that feeling gunna be again. 
I’ve been saying for the past few months to some people like, how funny it’s gunna be at that price resistance again. And I personally believe memes will again push BTC through $9000 again
@_date: 2019-05-03 14:12:10
Dank. 
Memes carried us past 9k. 
I’m going through my cold desktop and finding meme folders, prepped and loaded for 6K and beyond!!! Yeow
