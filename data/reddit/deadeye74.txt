Till Bitcoin wont have a better reputation amongst the less tech savy people and till it wont have a network of stores where u can buy a line of products with bitcoin, FIAT will rule of course, but what u do not see that if Bitcoin or any other altcoin will become more attractive financially to the masses, then a FIAT will die quickly!

Well, it is a good platform for using bitcoin stored in bank accounts! 8) What I mean is, when bitcoin will be adopted by goverments, it is inevitable to integrate it to the bank systems. There are a lot of old people who can not use bitcoin as the tech savvy new generation, so for them bitcoin will be only a new currency, and they wanna use it oldschool like they use paper money now.

Bitcoin is not anonimous, we all know that. For goverment to adopt to this type of currency, they have to admit that the paper money they printed so far are 2-10times less then the actual money supply they have only in digital form! As banks are creating digital, non existing money every time they give a loan, credit to anyone, individual, company or other bank. So in a system where ther is a public ledger, the blckchain, they can not do that, they can not create wealth overnight. And thats scary as hell for them! Goverment acceptation should be very delicate, like bathing a guy whos bones are all broken....but eventually, if someone come up with an idea, that hurt them the least, they will accept the change in power...
