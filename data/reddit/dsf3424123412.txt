British banks have not really kicked bitcoin exchanges out of the UK. The problem is that basically intersango and mtgox were accepting money sent from hacked bank accounts - not really their fault, but it's also unsurprising that the banks decided the simplest way to solve the problem was to shut their accounts.
I think the practice of accepting money from unverified customers using bank transfers isn't going to work in the UK. Exchanges need to find more secure ways of accepting money like cash deposits or fully verify their customers. The barclays pingit transfer system may work a bit better.. at least at the moment it's unlikely there's a huge pool of potential hacker victims with barclays pingit accounts, however if smartphone malware becomes more prevalent and lots of people start using pingit this too could become a problem some day.
I think eventually we'll have exchanges with full verification which can probably safely just ACH withdraw from your bank account the way paypal does it and the way coinbase works in the US and I don't think the banks will have any problem with this as long as it's done in a way that doesn't help hackers to empty people's bank accounts.

I think people are really taking this video the wrong way.. the MBAs aren't going to be scared of marijuana, they're going to go and order some! 
While it may not be the clean image a lot of us would like to promote it's certainly not 'bad' for bitcoin and frankly it's no secret that the silkroad exists so I don't think it really does any harm.
