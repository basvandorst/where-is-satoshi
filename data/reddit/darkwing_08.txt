No my friend.  You are the one falling.

I say lots of things but the important thing that I say is that bitcoin is doomed and you need to stop using it or you're doomed too.  I'm here to do that.  I'm going to post every day how bitcoin is a ponzi scheme and convince everyone that they are making a huge mistake.  I'll ignore points that are counter to what I am saying even if they are valid because I need to focus on the message in order to save you from yourself.

See!  Listen to this guy!  My dad told me all about Madoff.  He used new investor money to pay other investors and that's just like bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-01-15 16:45:30
I never bought.  If I bought bitcoin my dad would kill me.  I should have done it anyway when it was under 100 but I didn't because I'm afraid of my dad and he says it's a ponzi scheme.  I believe him and because I believe in what I am doing, that means I am right.  So don't worry, I will save you from yourself.

The facts don't matter.  What matters is that I am trying to help you.  Can't you see that?  My intentions are good and this makes me right.  Don't worry, I'm going to save you from yourself.  Someone has to do it, believe me, I'm not doing this to be a hero.  It's hard work pulling shit out of my ass all day.

ITS NOT SOUR GRAPES!  I'm trying to help you see that the price is going to fall to zero and I will have the last laugh when you have all lost your money because you didn't listen to me!  NOT SOUR GRAPES!!!!

Hi judah_mu, did you see how I [called that other guy a goyim](  Wasn't it beautiful how I highlighted his last name and called him a goyim?  He had a common name for a jew but I highlighted it and called him a goyim anyway.  I'm so witty.

YOU ARE ALL CHILDREN WHO DONT KNOW ANYTHING I NEED TO SAVE THE CHILDREN!  Don't you want to save the children?  Why are you against children?

I live in my parents basement and eat doritos all day.  I need all of the attention I can get so I don't kill myself.
@_date: 2014-01-15 18:21:05
  Please, I'm doing this for you, can't you see that?
@_date: 2014-01-15 17:42:05
I'm going to infer that you are not a jew in order to infer that a jew would not have made this mistake thus elevating jews above all else.  I learned this from my dad.
@_date: 2014-02-14 17:06:12
I am here, don't worry, I will protect you from yourself.  I am always watching for the right moment to tell you when you are going to lose all of your money.

Those are Dorito stains, not Cheetos.  I've got standards.
  
I'm starting to feel better about myself because you keep giving me attention!  But I must not let you distract me!  I need to stay focused so that I can save the masses from this ponzi scheme called bitcoin.  Sometimes I like to call it shitcoin when I'm not getting enough attention but I am very gratified right now by your replies.
@_date: 2014-01-17 02:25:02
I'm sorry, I just can't get over the fact that I missed the boat.  I'm so butthurt that people are out there making a future and all I can do is seek therapy on my computer ..in the basement.  Don't worry though, if I'm not able to save you, global warming will get you in the end.

I don't want bitcoin to succeed.  If it succeeds then I'll have to kill myself because I missed out on bitcoin when it was under 100.
@_date: 2014-01-15 00:35:47
The only way I can make myself feel better is to spread propaganda and act like an asshole.  I didn't buy bitcoin when it was under 100 dollars and I hate everyone else who did.  I've found that if I run around calling people names and spreading disinformation it makes me feel better.
@_date: 2014-02-14 21:42:22


  
But if people see I am wrong then they wont listen to me when I am trying to help them.  Can't you see that I am trying to save everyone from themselves?  Surely this is more important than some technicality like what you point out!  Do it for the children!  
@_date: 2014-02-14 21:22:52
I AM NOT SPREADING FUD!  CANT YOU SEE IM TRYING TO SAVE YOU FROM YOURSELF!?
@_date: 2014-01-15 16:23:47
I just can't help myself.  I'm miserable because I didn't buy bitcoin when it was under 100 and now I need to make everyone understand that they are making a mistake because they aren't doing what I am doing.  I haven't left the basement in months and my mom juts pushes food under the door because she doesn't even want to talk to me.  I always do the right thing so I know I am right here.  Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme and I must save everyone from themselves.  Don't worry everyone, Darkwings_08 is here!
@_date: 2014-01-15 18:24:51
I'm willing to suffer the humility in order to save you from yourself.  Somebody has to speak up about this ponzi scheme!  It's like I'm the only sane person around here and nobody can notice me!!
@_date: 2014-01-15 16:26:22
I just cant accept that I am wrong and that bitcoin is both a currency and a store of value.  My dad said it's a ponzi scheme so I must save everyone from this because ponzi schemes are bad and people get hurt when they fall for them.  All of you people trying to convince others to join the ponzi scheme are bad people.   But don't worry!  Darkwings_08 is here to save you from yourselves!
