Hey man appreciate your insight. Markets tend to go through several cycles when seen throughout time. In the same way analysts expect a crash every certain amount of years the same can be applied to assets such as Bitcoin. From the video: it's expected for a normal bear to run for an average of 18 months. I could direct you to further videos on this if you'd like as it's very interesting to observe.
Regardless, you are also right, nobody can say what the market will do tomorrow, but we can put in our best guess based on statistics that we've gathered from over a century's worth of data.

We did another BTC market analysis since there was so much hype with it reaching 9k. We're trying to do one a month with different coins, but this is 2nd one for btc for May.
Bit of higher time frame analysis on BTC from today. Key clusters of resistance and support areas. Quite a nice confluence of levels if I do say so myself.
Should paint a good picture for everyone where we'd like to be selling Bitcoins and where we'd like to be buying them back.
