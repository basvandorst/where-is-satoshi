I did the exact same thing! They wrote in their blog about the recent upgrade:

So I'd give it a few more days. It sucks that we couldn't buy yesterday's dip though.

That girl could blow.

I'm curious: That limit is 50k *per what*? Per month? Per year? Ever? Not that I'd have that amount to sell, but maybe some day ...

Me, me! Took me two hours last night to fall asleep. The price is still way off my mental exit point (and when I say exit point, I mean where selling 20% of my BTC will pay off the rest of my mortgage). But the trajectory is so insane right now that it could happen way sooner than I thought.

Thanks! TIL!

I don't want to go in exact numbers, but my strategy is buy a bit every month and hold. I'm lucky to have started out in 2013 and bought a bit since, basically about €50,- or €100,- here and there. I'm far, far from being a millionaire, but so far it looks like this is the investment of my lifetime.
I set aside 20% each for each of my sons, (2 and 4 y.o.) and hope it will be of good use to them when they start out into the world. Don't plan on touching those for the next 15 years.
Another 20% I plan to hodl more or less forever.
The rest I plan to sell in three tranches:
1) When it makes a noticeable difference in our family's finances. We're not rich, and €10.000 is a lot of money. But it wouldn't make a change in our quality of life and overall trajectory. €30.000 or €40.000 would. Depending on how things go from here, that day may come within the next year or so.
2) Next tranche would be when you can buy a medium to good apartment in the nearest city with it, as an investment and for our kids, if they want to study there later.
3) Tranche 3 I'll either sell of when BTC really is around a million or so and live the good life, or gradually draw from it as some kind of extra income.
I found it's easy to come up with these plans, but hard to stick to them. Also, the perspective changes as you grow older and other circumstances change. We'll see. Thinking about all this definitely keeps me up at night, and I permanently feel either excited and optimistic or worried and anxious. It's definitely distracting, and I hope that feeling subsides once I cash out tranche  because then I made at least enough to be able to say I made a good deal, no matter what happens next.

I've recently sent a small (replacable, non urgent) transaction with a rather small fee. When I checked my walled the next day, the TX was gone from the history. I  was confused, but didn't yet find time to investigate, but now that I checked again, there it is again in the list (still not confirmed though).
Is that what has happened here?

I bought the dip and the dip won

There is a whole range of possible scenarios between hunky-dory and apocalypse. I don't understand why some people can't grasp the difference between preparing for a recession/depression and the end of the world.

Is there any other way to get involved in mining, without setting up a rig yourself? Do you know anything about cloud mining?
@_date: 2017-10-22 07:34:50
Thanks! Yeah, that's what I thought. I guess if it was feasible, somebody else would have come up with the idea already.
