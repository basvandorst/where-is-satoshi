Alts didn't really have their moment until January, after btc had peaked and was on its way back to 6k. And its run from 5K to 20K was partially fueled by alt blood. It's rare for them both to be mooning at the same time and is usually one or the other.
@_date: 2019-07-08 21:32:40
Really? Because all my 2017 alts have been decimated from where they were that December/January and yet BTC is still standing strong. Doesn’t seem like coexistence to me.

It is if by the time they decide to cash out, it's easier just to buy stuff with BTC than convert back to fiat.

Out of curiosity, where do you think it came from last week?
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:49:29
With the exception of yesterday and earlier today, it’s felt like it’s been *trying* to go down since the crazy run last week, so I wouldn’t be surprised if we see it back in the 14K range in the next couple days.

I am not sure tbh, but if you look at the chart in this post, you can see the $17M volume candle is much larger than any other for that week.
@_date: 2019-11-19 17:14:53
There was $17M of sell volume at the same time they were moved.

It’s a lot easier to get away with stealing someone’s BTC than USD because unlike a bank it’s not insured and law enforcement will probably give literally no fucks about it.
@_date: 2019-06-19 19:40:12
Yes, and just because it's not pegged to the USD doesn't mean it's not a stablecoin. And it certainly still isn't an "investment".


Sounds like a stablecoin!

But one doesn't even "buy" Libra as an investment (it's a stable coin), so I don't know what you're even on about.
@_date: 2019-06-26 15:52:16
It's very possible, but are any of those avenues that you listed even open for business? Seems like they are all still saying "coming soon".
@_date: 2019-06-19 00:00:27


Just because it's not an investment doesn't mean it's not competition. They both want to be accepted by vendors as forms of payment. And it's hard enough to get vendors to add BTC as a payment option, so having two major options like that is going to be competitive by nature. And Facebook + its partners have pretty deep pockets to incentivize vendors for adding their currency.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:17:06
That would be cool, but I’m not holding my breath. The market seems very irrational, and irrational markets almost always correct HARD.
@_date: 2019-06-19 01:30:28
Very true. But it still sounds silly of OP to say that "all the plebes will buy libra" as though they are using it as an alternative to investing in crypto.

Except with infinitely deeper pockets to incentivize vendors to use their coin. Like discounts for customers who use it, for example. Also real partnerships with companies like Visa.

Coinbase opened an institutional buying branch last year, but it was so unsuccessfully that they already shut it down.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:17:28
Where did you buy a house that appreciated that fast, if you don’t mind me asking?
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:24:56
I’m personally thankful that BCH keeps enabling me to pick up discounted BCT.
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:37:13
Why would they be doing that now at 13K when they've had almost a year and a half to buy it much cheaper?
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:52:13
That’s amazing timing on your part. Congrats!
@_date: 2019-06-19 02:24:08
Huh, I don't remember shilling anything. You seem to be mistaking my clarifying whether or not it could be competition to BTC as actually giving a shit about it. I don't, but I also prefer discussions to be based in reality, and in my opinion, Libra being a competitor to BTC in some spaces could definitely be a real thing, whether I like the project or not. And yeah, I think their insanely deep pockets makes them more likely to be competition.
@_date: 2019-06-19 19:34:16
Obviously, but I fail to see why it would make people plebes to use a currency that will probably offer a lot of discounts to consumers to incentivize them to use it. It might even be the only way to pay for goods at certain places. It's like saying "only plebes use PayPal", but good luck buying anything on eBay without it.

Just buy only when the price is moving up (on strength), set a stop loss where you buy in and it’s hard to lose money.
