but this is already possible in exchanges. you can buy bitcoins with VISA. Why do you need to get them to your account first and send them and not just send them anyway? It's just an extra service
@_date: 2017-02-17 08:32:42
do they have any database or what? i can claim any number of coins?
@_date: 2017-02-10 19:56:23
but why this integration is so difficult?
@_date: 2017-02-27 14:46:55
get a skrill mastercard and use it to buy bitcons from the exchanges that allow mastercards
@_date: 2017-03-03 08:48:11
no, I sold my stash in 2012
@_date: 2017-02-06 12:54:40
maybe look at other alternative such as maidsafe if you are going to hold for so long
@_date: 2018-10-28 06:20:09
at $100K yes
@_date: 2017-08-01 07:42:47
been hearing this for years
@_date: 2017-08-03 10:18:21
btw, sorry for talking to you like you are a noob, didn't recognize the handle heh. In any case if you can reach out to them with some kind of offering would be cool. house of cards yo :)

Adam Back the CEO of blockstream proposed it with the miners so we can see what happens with x2. Nice wikipedia article but you understand that &gt; 80% of miners agreed on 2x right?
@_date: 2017-08-01 07:16:18
this is always the case if you never sell even after making x1000000000 profits. good luck with that, and we are bored with those memes really.
@_date: 2017-08-03 10:13:03
I read Adam Back's Tweet and as the majority of simple users would like to see some truce in this and see how things go. here 
Per my understanding which is not really uninformed since I am spending hours everyday reading the news the 2x movement with the NY agreement has a lot of hash power. And lately there is discussion that real Bitcoin is the one of the most hash power. I am a developer myself and I understand the developer argument but Bitcoin is also an economic/societal experiment. I am *not* backing 2x or BCC.
It's naive yes but I like his proposal that "let us see how LN and Segwit faires and then see if we need more scaling". Why not?
@_date: 2017-08-08 10:05:49
unfortunately i am not sure why this has not taken off yet but you can't find much stuff online

how do you differentiate between coffee and salary payments?
@_date: 2018-06-12 15:24:42
Don't want to hijack the thread but I am running this service since 2016. It's [ and you can have an email that you customize payments and also donations. Cheers
@_date: 2019-02-21 16:04:57
there we go again :)
@_date: 2017-04-26 08:23:57
there are many altcoins better than bitcoin technically now
@_date: 2017-04-15 08:03:22
No but this is one of the dozen of use cases. Also if you currently send something you get 0 replies. And this is provided that if Angelina decides to run a donation campaign she has the decency to keep her promise. It's not an absolute guarantee.

apparently you don't understand the difference of turing complete programming on the blockchain
@_date: 2017-04-20 14:28:33
you mean that if someone invented the wheel noone should invent the car. makes sense!
@_date: 2017-04-08 17:47:26
it's boring to see wackky posts like this everyday about Polo when in fact it's some minor admin issue
@_date: 2017-04-14 16:38:54
thanks although my website was up before 21.co
@_date: 2018-11-09 09:38:34
no problems at all

it's not Aprils fool right?
@_date: 2019-01-18 07:31:25
I am always open for new projects ;)
@_date: 2019-01-17 19:10:59
no sorry i built it much before lightening was operational. if I get people interested I will probably add it
@_date: 2019-01-20 10:19:18
The difference is that on Earn both parties need accounts and they need to login. In my service, you work with email as always. No other hassle
@_date: 2019-01-17 14:33:24
It's a long story and I am bitter about it.Let's leave it at that. 
@_date: 2019-01-18 12:14:00
hey I am sorry. We are talking about open source revolution here, I didn't think I would need to ask permission for a screenshot shared publicly on reddit and shows something that Satoshi publicly wrote on a mailing list without any names mentioned. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 14:45:08
could you try again please?
@_date: 2019-01-18 13:21:36
Indeed I didn't intent to make a post until I saw your pic in another sub and decided I will post :)
@_date: 2019-01-17 14:44:55
could you try again? there was some server issue
@_date: 2019-01-17 14:49:39
There was a server error I fixed, sorry for that. Intention counts I hope :)
@_date: 2019-01-17 18:57:27
it's a paywall. it is free to email important people but they never reply. it's also an anti-spam protection but I think this use case is secondary.
@_date: 2017-05-23 08:28:09
that was a 1/1000000 occurance
@_date: 2017-05-19 07:52:23
I was more talking about monthly
@_date: 2017-05-26 07:57:20
I was mined 200BTC and was sending cold emails to companies for adoption.Then one morning I woke up and decided a deflationary currency is not possible and sold at $12. What a morning idea I had.
@_date: 2017-05-19 07:27:15
there are some projects lately using other chains like ascribe.io or creativechain or decent for drm etc
@_date: 2017-05-07 14:03:22
how do they know for how long you held the bitcoins? say you buy from local market and then want to cash out your 100x profits from an ICO that happened 1 year and 1 day before
@_date: 2017-05-16 08:01:59
how much do you need for a good life there? and how do you monetize your BTC? Xapo style VISAs? curious
@_date: 2017-07-13 08:45:50
go to an austrian post office
@_date: 2017-07-16 10:34:30
if you are 100% sure bet on the opposite outecome
@_date: 2017-07-06 12:57:31
why is it so difficult to understand what i am saying? you convert btc to fiat (paying capital gains) and you buy a house without a mortgage if you can afford it. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 13:09:50
sorry didn't get that we only post facts in reddit
@_date: 2017-07-09 15:27:20
cash out to alts. we are preoccupied with a problem that most other alts have already solved. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 10:20:02
@_date: 2017-05-06 09:50:18
you are the reason reddit is a disaster, it's difficult to combat your idiocy
@_date: 2017-07-15 09:20:47
very low actually since everyone wants to activate segwit on aug 1

you know there is a nuclear bunker for sale for bitcoin on bitpremier? :)
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:30:24
why 2?
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:52:07
I know its kinda lame, but did you try to call them or find their address and just go there if you are in US? Why are you locked out by the way?

I am reshuffling my holdings without selling. I just bought some coins that I wanted just because they dipped more than the others
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:38:41
severe lack of humor itt
@_date: 2017-07-23 08:46:29
you diversify in alts
@_date: 2017-07-31 08:11:12
what's the user community that supports BCC exactly? ViaBTC traders?
@_date: 2017-07-27 07:20:59
dude, its not a serious statement
@_date: 2017-07-17 07:43:27
when? be specific as the answers are not relevant
@_date: 2017-07-23 08:40:45
 you buy this now and have peace of mind ;)
@_date: 2017-07-27 07:44:44
I agree that this is why we are part of crypto to change world jurisdictions 
@_date: 2017-07-15 09:05:28

sell everything now and jump off the window!!! sell your wife and kids and buy gold!!
@_date: 2017-07-09 15:29:23
this would be suicidal
@_date: 2017-07-15 11:25:40
I understand it but there is no uncertainty if you dig into the situation. There will be for sure in 3 months but not now
@_date: 2017-07-27 07:35:05
I am saying if these guys hacked mtgox. not the case where their prosecution is about KYC
@_date: 2017-07-31 08:21:17
check his OAK fund performance vs the SP500 I don't have the time for the link but its hilarious.

Have you seen Billions being poured in startups for making veggie bags in Silicon Valley? Learn to compare and about startups before you post.
@_date: 2017-07-13 09:04:16
with this logic (which I like) it's actually safer to buy BTC before the 1st otherwise you will be gambling after for many months. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 11:02:28
what I mean is that the way to go is to buy the whole house with bitcoin without a mortgage. just wait till december :D
@_date: 2017-07-06 07:22:06
who wants to check if you buy with own funds?
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:59:23
i got a rejection too for no apparent reason  
@_date: 2017-07-23 08:47:21
70% and ALL in altcoins and zero bitcoins
@_date: 2017-07-26 08:59:13
yes and if you don't time well you lose for sure. take the predictive advice of a redditor for such great profits :D
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:45:56
China and Russia don't try to impose their law by arresting people in other countries like the SEC wants to do.
@_date: 2017-07-20 08:57:19
so you want bitcoin to do what sia,ethereum,monero,elastic,golem etc do? read up some won't you mate? :)
@_date: 2017-07-26 08:57:52
founder has coded projects like bitshares that are not only working but have the best codebase. what fud lol. I don't even hold any EOS but I get pissed off reading mumbo jumbo
@_date: 2017-07-13 08:43:06
you start but not posting this here. nevertheless if someone finds a way to hack bitcoin he cannot be that stupid not to discover a way to sell it off (hit 1-2 clicks)
@_date: 2017-07-16 10:27:02
if you are not trolling, have you measured your iq?
@_date: 2017-07-08 08:23:42
maybe im a weirdo masochist but i like to live through this drama and base my mood according to coinmarketcap for the day lol
@_date: 2017-07-11 08:45:45
that's why the polybious project was born. i hope they succeed in making a crypto friendly bank
@_date: 2017-07-06 07:21:29
the point is not to use mortgage or traditional banks to purchase :) 
@_date: 2017-07-23 14:26:10
multiple times more profit with alts. i like bitcoin though
@_date: 2017-07-20 09:15:42
it's not that all altcoins can be redesigned on the bitcoin. first why would anyone do the redundant coding again and second there are coins with functionalities that cannot be done with a sidechain (sia,elastic,golem etc etc)

I can bet that you will not go long with all you have because you will wait for segwit2x scare to pass and then train is gone. Timing dips is hard buddy
@_date: 2017-06-17 11:58:18
because scenario 3 is the most probable + market will decide much before what will happen on the 1st
@_date: 2017-07-27 07:56:19
It is not very clear. They did launder the money from the hack but they still don't know if Alex hacked mtgox or not. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 09:10:44
if people didn't make these kind of transactions obviously there would be no value in a coin that doesn't get spent
@_date: 2017-06-07 09:52:01
it's funny how bitcoin hodlers think about the current system. if you get to $3mil it's because there will be a reversal and index funds don't pay anymore
@_date: 2017-07-22 10:49:53
u mean converting bitcoin to XAPO and using your mastercard to buy everything? how difficult could that be..
@_date: 2017-06-06 08:23:30
trust me, it's just a project that will need 5M and three years to write a final report that ultimately serves no purpose other than financing workshops to discuss how to organize workshops to talk about a possible workshop to talk about the problem. that's how the eu commission works.

anyone checked out the Quantum Resistant Ledger?
@_date: 2017-06-21 06:43:33
someone would need to crack your dropbox + crack your password. this combo together is ultra hard to do unless someone is running a keylogger on your pc. but then every pass method is the same.so i'd say it's OK. if you have millions just get a ledger s or trezor
@_date: 2017-06-19 07:43:25
can you write a blog post with your feelings? I did something similar on a much smaller scale but I'm not very cool about it :) many people would be interested in this story
