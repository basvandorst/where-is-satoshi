Let's upvote this shit and hit the author hard in the comments, telling him he has no idea what's he talking about.
Perhaps he gets some hard time by his bosses as this really throws real shade on the site, which is fairly known and big in financial industry.

HODL - sure. But not in a literal sense. HODL is just patient trading. You HODL 90% of the time, but enter and exit market at optimal points.

So many authors on Forbes and every one of them has different opinion to his colleague.

Why wouldn't this designer just use letters instead of symbols? Some of them are not easy to grasp on first sight.

I am sure Satoshi is browsing around the forum and perhaps this subreddit using his burner accounts. Perhaps some of us even got to engage in conversation with him. Or even better - he might be trolling people on forums and subreddits :)

A bit embarrassing but everyone needs to go through teething pains.

If you got stuck in alts - yes, you lose. If you keep your portfolio mostly in btc, you just chill and wait for the bull run to accumulate more

5k or 6k - does it make a difference? 
We know when something ignites bitcoin, it gains couple of thousands in value in a matter of hours. 
So, Poland might cost us couple of hours of bull run some time in the future? 
No problem, if you ask me.

Nice headline - and the story ends there.
Just pay your taxes or move to an exotic island which is tax paradise at the same time.

Brand hijackers typically set up an account that appears to be affiliated with a specific brand or service and then use that account in a way that can be destructive to a brand’s reputation, message, or corporate identity. 
So, yes - Roger literally took the definition and followed it blindly, without missing one single property of a brand hijacker.
