Why would those kids get hooked on heroin if oxycodone (prescription med) is more affordable and has a better quality rush than heroin, and is equally addictive?
Tobacco dependence (usually free base nicotine) is stronger than heroin/oxy dependence btw. Only the effects of withdrawal are worse with heroin and oxycodone. Alcohol is less addictive, but more harmful overall than heroin/oxy.

It's completely understandable he doesn't want to do that. The USA are a huge threat to his life. They will probably throw him into jail for the rest of his life right away, and no one will get their money back because the government will keep it. See what they did to Liberty Reserve.

If Snowden had a problem with it he would already have said so.

Silk Road sellers don't kill people or ruin lifes. Though their lifes may get ruined by governments which perverted democracies into oppressive regimes spreading imbecile propaganda. If they didn't start a shortsighted, unscientific, misanthropic and brutal war on drugs the Silk Road wouldn't even need to exist.

Nice. Maybe this will make Bitcoin more widely known in India.

Actually it's stupid to sell, unless you need to convert Bitcoin into fiat soon anyway. After every previous crash the value got even higher after some time.

You are deluded by propaganda. That's not being awake. You're like some towel head in Afghanistan who thinks selling alcohol is unethical. Illegal? Yes. Unethical? No.
Putting people into jail for weed is unethical however. It's not different from oppressive regimes which put you into jail for alcohol. Alcohol is more harmful than weed and most other illegal drugs btw.
