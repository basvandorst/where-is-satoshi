It's an empirically based social science
And you're an idiot

Your error is conflating public and private debt. They could not be more different.
The point you raise is entirely legitimate for private debt. However, the US can and does meet any nomial obligation to service its debt, because it is denominated in the currency that they issue. This does not mean that the government should recklessly print money into existence . The US government creates money as required to accommodate a growing economy.

Except that he is 100% correct and it is you that is clueless. Public sector debt is equal to the private sector savings (that is true literally by definiton - a liability on one balance sheet is an asset on another). Moreover, the US government debt is denominated its own currency which it itself is the issuer of. To make the claim that the US has pulled wealth from future generations is completely disingenuous or completely ignorant. Please educate yourself on some basic economic theory before making yourself look like a bigger fool.

I'm just repeating myself at this point so afterward I won't bother. You are mischaracterising public debt as private debt and it makes no sense to think or talk about government debt as you would private debt. Please think very hard about what it _actually_ means to "repay" government debt

Again you are not recognising the distinction between public and private debt. The issue you raise is again legitimate for private debt but is not at all illogical with respect to public spending. 
I'm not dense to logic, and never made the claim that economics could not function without government money and to say otherwise is to strawman me. I simply pointed out to you how the current system works; government defitics are a feature not a bug.
