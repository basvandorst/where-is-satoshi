Thanks for this comment. Lately I’ve been feeling like I missed out big on bitcoin in the years prior because I looked into it but then ignored the whole thing. Reminding me that Mt. Gox is magic the gathering has helped jog my memory of the kind of thing that turned me away from investing. Maybe I missed out but I don’t feel like a made a bad financial choice by staying away at the time.

It's pretty straight forward really, take a look around the website (without actually doing any trades). Get an idea of how things work. If there's something in particular you need clarification with, google is your best friend. Basically you want to move the coins from coinbase to gdax (free), sell using a limit sell, and then transfer your fiat out of the account.

Yes that's right, because one person is selling lots of their coins at that price it creates a 'wall'. Even though people are still buying, the sheer quantity of coins available means that the price stops moving up until all of the coins at that price are bought.

Actually you're half right and half wrong. Someone was selling a very large number of bitcoin at $17250. Because GDAX is just one exchange, the other exchanges may continue to rise higher in price. This causes more buying pressure on GDAX as suddenly the bitcoins on GDAX are 'cheaper' than anywhere else. Imagine you go from shop to shop and everywhere sells cheese for $10. Except one place, that has cheese for $5. Everyone will rush to buy the $5 cheese before it runs out. Same basic principle. 
As soon as that large seller ran out of bitcoins to sell, suddenly the price jumped up higher to where the rest of the market was.

Relatively new investor here. Because I'm new I don't feel any real attachment to any one coin. I know you're saying hold, but wouldn't it be better to sell, buy BCH, ride the way up and then if it starts dropping, sell and reinvest into bitcoin? That way if BCH takes over, you're holding the right coin and if it drops you can just quickly return to bitcoin.

Isn't the whole point of design of bitcoin so that, if there's only one person mining, it'll scale the difficulty so it still takes the same amount of time to complete? With the coin worth so much, I can't imagine people will stop mining it since even if half the miners switch, the other half will be rushing to get the easier money

To be honest I think you're probably right but at the end of the day I'd rather play it safe. People still buy and sell BCH because those people were invested in it and it created its own, inferior market. So once it's well established that Segwit2x isn't the future coin we'll all be using, I'll sell. Even if that means less profiting off other people.

I don't have a crystal ball but I imagine if it becomes truly widespread and used as a global currency, when people start selling it off, the market will have flattened out and the people buying it will be buying much smaller quantities, so rather than crashing, it'll simply stay mostly flat.

For real, I had a buy set for $7920 and got frustrated that it was going up and then I thought to myself 'It's just going to keep going up now, isn't it?' so I went all in at $8250, feeling pretty unsure about the decision, expecting it to suddenly drop as soon as I bought.

This is exactly the thought process that had me invest in bitcoin originally. I suffered a loss of $2000 in a different area of my life and it made me realise that I was young and could afford loses like that, so I decided I could afford to play risky strategies like buying into bitcoin.

Supply and demand. Simple as that. Because the price is going up so fast, there are less people willing to sell (why sell now when you can get an extra $500 out of it by dinner time?) and more people wanting to buy, this means that the demand is increasing exponentially and the supply is steadily decreasing.

Exactly this, half the reason the price is growing so quickly is that every day there's thousands of new people trying to buy into the market and I'd guess that the majority of those are buying to hold, so once they've got their share of bitcoin, they disappear, leaving a smaller pool for everyone else to trade from.
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:30:29
Relevant username? ;) But yeah I totally agree, you can't reflect too much on past mistakes or missed opportunities. For example I calculated that if I had bought Bitcoin cash just before the pump and dump started, and then sold it at it's high and bought back into bitcoin while it was at the bottom of it's dip, I could've turned my investment from thousands to hundreds of thousands, but I wasn't to know how the market would move.
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:56:50

That's so weird, I used to work for a guy who ran an investment property seminar, free event where at the end they'd ask people to sign up for their course. He used to tell a story near the end of his talk that would be very personal and finish with him shouting and crying exactly like Roger in that video. The first time I watched him, I though it was raw emotion, but when I then listened to his same talk a hundred times after that and he always broke down in the same way every night, it didn't take long to realise it was 100% faked. But boy oh boy did it sell their course to some people.

I think calling it free money isn't quite right. With something has hotly debated as Segwit2x, it's pretty damn hard to predict what will happen. It's possible the value of both coins combined will be less than that of a current coin due to the split market.

What've you got in mind?

Not even months, two days ago I was waiting to buy at $7700AUD when the price was $7900. Now I look at that $7900 wistfully because it’s $8500.

I was gifted 500,000 doge back when it first started but I don't remember where I stored them. Is it worth me trying to dig up where they might've ended up?

At the end of the day, no one really knows what they’re doing. Some people are better than others at predicting but at the end of the day, no one knows for certain if the market is about to drop or if it’ll spike up again. 
I dropped in $10k last week when it was near it’s high at $7700AUD and spent the next few days regretting it because the price was below where I bought. But now it’s at $8000AUD and I wish I could buy more at $7700. *Assuming* the general trend continues and you just buy and hold, you’ll do well for yourself regardless of what happens in the short term.

I knew about bitcoin years ago, very almost invested back in 2012 (regretting now obviously) but it took hearing bitcoin on mainstream news, even just as a final segment interest piece, for me to commit to buying into the market. The fact that crypto is making it into headlines means that more people are able to become aware of it.

Or maybe it's people like this guy, who keep buying at the all-time highs are the reason the price is going to keep going up?

Unfortunately it seems like a lot of people bought when we'd gone up considerably. But that isn't really surprising when you think about it. If you are an average person with say $1000 you can afford to part with, and you buy 1 btc for $1k, what happens when the price goes up? Other average people look at you and want to buy. So you sell your 1btc for $10,000. But the thing is, you sold it to other average people. And they only had $1k as well. So now for the same amount of btc, you have ten times as many people holding it. Each with 0.1btc. Then the market crashes and now ten people are either stuck holding or decide to sell their much smaller portion. Even if most of them sell, you still have more people holding than originally when the price was cheapest. It took a lot of people wanting to buy btc for it to reach almost $20k in January. The few sold to the many. The question is, what do the few that made lots of money do once the price cools off? Chances are they want to roll again, so they try to push the price down further so they can recollect the btc they sold.

Definitely 20/20 for hindsight, everyone wishes they had a way of seeing into the future of markets.

Definitely not but my figuring is that as long as you hold both coins after the split, it’ll all end well for you eventually when prices recover for the prevailing coin.
