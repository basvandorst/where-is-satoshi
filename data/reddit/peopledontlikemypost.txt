If OP wants it to it to be worth a lot of money in the future, it needs to.come.off the keychain.
Vintage items need to be in near mint quality to get a good price.

So they do have a contingency plan

You guys must remember, we aren't the developers of nice sunsets. I'm surprised people that people are blaming us.

A bot can do that for him

Good luck competing with free

Not at all, it was a joke as was the comment you originally replied to. 
Now I definitely know why you don't get invited to parties.
@_date: 2016-06-28 04:51:52
Sounds a bit too close to "pre-crime" for my comfort.

Spenders are the reason bitcoin is still alive. Bitcoin is a currency before an investment. Without the currency aspect, it would fail pretty fast.
@_date: 2016-06-19 17:18:27
So..what is it?
@_date: 2016-06-14 12:57:17
Bitcoin is volatile. Do your research and understand the risks before asking your family to donate in bitcoins.

The same situation happened with Mt.Gox 6months before the goxxing. Karpeles was on this sub for AMA soon after to ensure goodwill is not lost.

I ask people to study and understand risks to a degree that they are no longer trusting my advice to invest.
Because I don't want to catch the blame if the price ever drops and its better for their own sake that they believe in the product they're investing in.

Your spidey sense should always tingle at btc-e. They could go down any minute and there's nothing that can be done about it. It's a very suspicious marketplace.

I would like to move to a country where burger is currency

Ltc has genuine advantages over bitcoin, but right now these advantages are too minor for the general public to notice. 
Once the people accept bitcoin and the honeymoon season has passed, then you might see LTC start to close the gap with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-06-19 17:11:33
At localbitcoins?
@_date: 2016-06-13 18:20:55
You can always trade and profit it into a full coin. It's not easy, but on volatile days like these, its not difficult either. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 23:39:44
We (other countries) should at least send over food supplies. 
I would pitch in if wants to do this.

When ToS and law are in conflict, the law sustains. Conflicting terms are rendered non-enforcable and courts will uphold it for you. 
Long story short, they can write whatever they want, but they can't take away your rights.
@_date: 2016-06-14 08:32:02
Bitcoin's value is whatever people are willing to pay for it. Which clearly isn't anywhere close to 5 years right now. 
@_date: 2016-06-19 17:16:39
You don't get invited to many parties do you?
@_date: 2016-11-30 10:57:00
Indians have 4 options:
Outside of this, you will have to wire transfer money to foreign bitcoin exchanges and trade there. Since this your first purchase, I would recommend you to stick to the first four options. 
@_date: 2016-11-30 13:51:46
Wire Transfer is a money transfer method similar to NEFT, RTGS but Wire transfer is used for international transactions. You can open an account with any of the big international exchanges like - Kraken, bitfinex, itbit and but bitcoins at the market price. You might need to go through KYC procedures and send your funds via wire transfer, all of which takes time.

The most you can do from the address is check if the coins are still there.
Then its upto you to recall where the coins are and regain access to the wallet.
If you forgot your password or lost 2fa to your web wallet, it could be easy. Desktop wallet on a defunct computer is a little more difficult.

Sell on localbitcoins, ask for new 500 notes. 2000 notes are rarely accepted for small purchases.

What's the Chinese meltdown story? I missed that one
@_date: 2016-12-29 02:48:33
I would wait for the prices to stabilize first. Then stagger the purchase at a secure exchange over a period of a couple weeks.

You might need to go to the bank in person and fill out a form for it.
