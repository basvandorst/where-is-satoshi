Go to random.org, rig the odds against yourself and send me what you would have lost to a scam or rigged bitcoin betting site. ;)

I think he might be trying to cheat the system. By buying at a higher price and trying to cancel it so he can buy lower. Is this true?
@_date: 2017-02-09 06:04:35

@_date: 2017-02-06 05:32:09

Use cash IMO. You can only freeze it if you put it in a freezer, which still takes hours...
@_date: 2017-02-12 07:35:55
But enough to get the average Joe?

If you want cloud mining,  you should either go to nicehash or hashnest. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 18:06:16
This only applies to 500 usd plus transactions that may be flagged
@_date: 2017-01-28 05:01:29
So then the government does have some control over bitcoins? For example, China's huge firewall. Or if the government just stopped the internet servers.
@_date: 2017-01-28 21:50:43
Just use purse. It's like over double the discount with prime shipping. You don't even share your address.

@_date: 2017-01-07 07:51:03
@_date: 2017-01-20 00:52:52
Yeah lol. He means you pay him in fiat rather than btc
@_date: 2017-01-09 01:28:43
TLDR; Paypal= RIP for no apparent reason, prob just Coinbase being terrible
@_date: 2017-01-24 03:09:35
I think he means up 10% in BTC, not the fiat equivalent
@_date: 2017-01-14 06:48:36

@_date: 2017-04-25 05:29:50
Yes. Many people transacting at a similar time were just combined 
@_date: 2017-04-05 17:59:21
But you just have to believe. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:43:27
Anything shorter would cause collisions, duo it is only more insecure
@_date: 2017-09-02 18:35:11
