You can disagree with it until your blue in the face. Your ass is still going to jail for tax evasion if you don't pay taxes on your profits.

I pay fees initially and then get refunded all ATM fees. Internet Banking FTW

I guess we have vastly different ideas of what the term "small" and "large" means in this context.

Because a "large, all BTC" economy will never exist

You should consider moving if you live somewhere that cigarettes costs $10/pack. You're getting fucked without lube and don't even seem to mind.

For anyone that might be confused as to how the world "rating" system works, it's detailed here: 
As therealpersona stated, it's is impossible for the US to be considered anything but the First World as the First World only applies to the US, UK and their allies. Here's the breakdown:
1. First world - US, UK, all US/UK allies
2. Second World - Soviet Union, China, and their Allies
3. Third World - Neutral and Non-Aligned Countries
This [map]( is a good reference to use. (Blue = first world, Red = second world, Green= third world)

People have this idea that a megacorp like Google should start taking bitcoin to circumvent government restrictions. Personally, I think those people are fucking crazy, regardless, this should have been a self post to inspire conversation that just included the link as reference material.

No, it's not a crime, this is what happens when banks fail.
