Thanks. Any specific practical guide you would suggest I followed to make this happen?


Yeah hehe I guess it's a way to also seek more information for future investments and not just this small one. It may also help someone in a similar situation.

First of all thank you very much for the thorough answer.


Right, even with my limited knowledge, I agree. Besides, the volatility of the market makes it impractical in the frequency that some people do it, like daily.     


Certainly, will do.     


I'm definitely an apologist of the first statement and believe that cryptocurrencies are the future, so yeah I believe investment is the way to go.
Thanks a lot. Can you suggest me any good and reliable step-by-step guide to make this happen?

Ok, thanks. My country only has bitcoin ATMs in some cities, so I might try localbitcoins.com.
Is a mobile phone wallet better than a desktop one? Any particular reason to suggest MyCelium (is there a lot of practical differences between these  ?)? Can I later one change wallets, if I want to?
