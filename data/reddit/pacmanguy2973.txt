We all work 3 months out of the year to support all the wars, the federal reserve, the IRS. Our states provide a lot more services for a lot less. This clown doesn't understand bitcoin or the fact that if it's banned everyone will just switch to litcoin or use a vpn. He wants to take away the little hint of freedom we find in being able to make payments easily. It's all about control under the guise of protection just like with any mafia or power hungry dictatorship. Old school manipulation of the weak and the scared public. If the public is not scared they try to make them scared. Are there any facts that indicate bitcoin makes our country any less safe? Money laundering, pedophilia, terrorism, fraud are keywords they have used for years to scare suckers into accepting more regulation. They used the mortgage crisis to over-regulate and consolidate the lending industry and destroy their competition after bailing out Bank of America. Wasn't it the big investment banks who were buying, packaging and selling these toxic loans for people who had no income? Most of these banks are still around but how many local lenders are left? Now they want to ban bitcoin. Why? Because people lost money on Mt. Gox. Anyone storing a significant amount of any currency on Mt. Gox should have understood the risk. I have never kept a balance with any online wallet for more than a few minutes. It says this on the front page of the bitcoin website that there is risk to having someone else store your bitcoin. Mt. Gox had already had withdrawal issues in the past. If you were trading currency on Mt. Gox for profit you should have known the risks too and you were not utilizing bitcoin for it's true benefit of simplified payments you were just a speculator. There are infinite legal securities and investments that are much more likely to go to zero. Worldcom and Enron burned a lot more people so should we just ban big corporations?
