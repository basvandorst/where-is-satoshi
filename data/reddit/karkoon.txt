How did they make that the url is changing while scrolling the page?

What is the life-time of Bitcoin?

He is saying about it while having only one drawer with money. What if there are 7 billions of drawers? What if there is more? Will the number still be large enough to not be guessed?

That's just a workaround.

And what if the one satoshi will be too valuable to use it as a form of exchanging small amounts of money and we will change from one satoshi to something even smaller. And then we will have 0,5 satoshi as a reward. Can it happen?

I don't really understand what you are saying... txdis? 
What if I will make a private key and a public key which will match someone's keys?
@_date: 2015-05-19 19:27:42
I'm not asking about the number. I'm asking why there can't be more bitcoins if their are infinitely divisable and every now and then the reward for miners is halved. 
When I think about it, it may be the case that it is now divisable to 8 floating points. There may be more fractions of bitcoins if we change from 8 to 32 or something.

I'm asking this from a purely theoretical point of view. 
I think I've found a simple yes or no question:
If we decided to "add" more digits to BTC before the 2140 would the miners still get some reward after the 2140 cap?
@_date: 2015-05-19 19:48:43
I know but what would happen if the nth half was near the limit of BTC? The (n+1)th would be 0. 
Let's assume that one satoshi will be worth 1$ in 2140 and we will change the number of allowed digits to something like 32. Will the (n+1)th half have a value (btw. Should I use "have" or "has" in this sentence? "Has" sounds weird.) because then nthReward/2 will give a proper result? 
I know enough about Bitcoin to not be introduced to it again. I appreciate it anyways. It is very kind that you try to make more people familiar with it. :)

    Last reward while using 8 floating points         -&gt; 0.00000001 BTC
    Last(?) reward while using 10 floating points     -&gt; 0.0000000100 BTC
    Last(?) + 1 reward while using 10 floating points -&gt; 0.0000000050 BTC
They would receive less than one satoshi but it would still be counted because of the increased divisibility.

Or no Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-05 17:58:03
Except when they will divide their btc between thousands of private keys.

Have we not learnt from Smoleńsk? 
^(almost ^whole ^Polish ^government ^died ^in ^a ^catastrophe) 
@_date: 2015-09-05 18:25:40
So there is another question: What happens when I don't want people to know how many btc I have?
@_date: 2016-10-25 15:00:37
Remember that the Internet happened because of government initiative.

You care too much to defend it :y
