This happens to me if I force breathing too heavy. Just relax and focus on your breath but DONT inhale or exhale excessively. Otherwise you will be retaining too much CO2 and you will start to get lightheaded. Just breath normally but pay attention to it.

Bitcoin is associated with illicit purchases, like on the Silk Road. All publicity about that connection has been bad for the market. If governments shut down exchanges (like in China) then you see those drops.
On the other hand, Dogecoin is funding charities and gaining good publicity. It's easy to act like you know life on the other side of the coin, but what you are forgetting is that for a market to survive, it needs to constantly be moving. People are just going to sit on bit coin because they think the value is going to skyrocket. Dogecoin is the most daily traded crypto currency in the world.

How does one accrue interest on bitcoin in an IRA without converting it to fiat? Kind of confused by your comment. Won't you pay a capital gains tax as well?

If he's in it for the long run, he's gonna be fine either way. Hence why I personally am dollar cost averaging 25$ btc purchases every month.

+1.4% in a single day isn't much? Next few days will push similar numbers I reckon. 
@_date: 2017-02-09 15:19:22
Can anyone explain WHY they are doing this?

What happens in 2140 when all the blocks get solved? Isn't that then the death of bitcoin because miners won't be monitoring transactions anymore?

I'm saying that, compared to where the price will be in 4 years (imo), he's buying in a dip regardless.

You could mine an altcoin with it. I have a MBP Retina 2012, and I mined Dogecoin for a bit using my university's energy (lived in the dorm at the time). I made barely any money, but it was kinda cool making "coins" over night! I also overheated my laptop for extended periods of time and probably messed up the battery because of it.

I'm not disputing that the ACTUAL value will be the same. But won't the PERCEIVED value be different? Based on human psychology etc.

Can you ELI5 how a decision is made on what is updated? Do miners just collectively choose to use a new protocol or client that incorporates segwit?

I have a question - after seeing the Breadwallet thread I am weary about keeping my coins on my phone any longer. 
I want to make a paper wallet / cold storage.  I understand how you can send coins to a paper wallet by scanning the QR code.. But my question is.. how do you remove the coins from the paper wallet back onto an exchange? Is there a guide for this?

Can anyone ELI5 segwit?

I have no income lol. I'm a student right now but I'm sitting on a small sum of money that I'd rather invest carefully by dollar-cost-averaging
@_date: 2017-01-31 19:45:35
By what basis do you make that claim? 
@_date: 2017-01-02 21:44:43
If bitcoin is really going to replace fiat it will only happen when we stop tracking it based on its value in USD 
@_date: 2017-01-10 21:59:05
Was that like an error though? Or the fact that he mined it by himself?
@_date: 2017-01-01 18:29:58


I had to look it up too. This video explains it pretty well!

concern troll.. best time to get is in NOW
@_date: 2017-01-10 22:24:12
OH that explains it. So literally every other block mined was always chosen to reward the max value? Nobody else wanted to test that?
@_date: 2017-01-02 18:25:26
If I delete the wallet from my phone, the address I used to send money from coinbase will still exist right? As in, my wallet can still receive money even though i don't have it installed on my phone? 
Thanks a lot!

947 according to coinmarketcap. We could see 1K overnight...

I've never used a mobile wallet but right now I have some BTC sitting on my coinbase account. Can you make a backup of a mobile wallet? What if I lose my phone? 
@_date: 2017-01-10 15:42:14
Sure, at a valuation of 1btc = 22$

Doesn't my account and information actually belong to Airbitz then?

I bought in at 650 and sold at 450 (thought it was collapsing)... I'm debating getting back into it now.....

Well for one, there will never be 21M coins considering how many will be lost in the next 100 years and have already been lost.
