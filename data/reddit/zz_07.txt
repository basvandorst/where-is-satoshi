I think the time to panic is when some news comes out that realistically indicates that BTC is fucked (or is no where near as good as people thought/expected it to be). Nothing like that has come out as far as I know. But there was a lot of expectation of a correction, so I think that has likely exacerbated this drop. Personally I think keeping track of what is happening with BTC news - uptake/developing the technology etc. is more important than what is happening with price. Reddit is good for that I think.

I agree with what you say about bitcoin, and I also agree that the technology is amazing.

Thanks. I would like to hear the reasons - if you don't mind taking the time to describe them. Thank you.

I like everyone's conviction!

thanks. What sort of spread do you normally see roughly? Sorry, I am trying to judge roughly how difficult it is to make money. thanks

There is r/BTC and bitcoinmarkets and different ones for Alts etc. There are also YouTube channels like world crypto network and aantonop.

Day trading technically means all your positions/Investments are closed by the end of the day (everything you buy has to be sold by the end of the day). However I think in this case people mean frequent buying and selling, trying to profit from volatility.

Thank you. What you say is interesting. I have only really been reading about cryptocurrency since yesterday, so still very new. But there are key things you say that struck me yesterday when first reading about it. I don't work in finance and don't trade Forex etc. So I thought I might be missing something. This morning I read this Forbes article:
It has this paragraph:
' 'Real’ money - the fiat pounds Sterling (GBP) issued by central and commercial banks - is not going out of fashion any time soon. It has problems. In some cases some say it’s barely fit for purpose. But we need it, because being as it is issued by banks and governments, that’s how we pay for our mortgages, taxes, loans and much else besides. And, with the help of the right blockchain it could be improved with relatively little effort.'
I guess the issues you point out have been discussed at length. It strikes me that essentially for bitcoin and other cryptos a community is developing a technology that could in principle be adapted/selectively adopted by central banks to improve fiats at some point in the future. Or govs could develop their own crytpos, like China, that are widely adopted and marginalise the use of BTC etc. 
Current cryptos will always be limited in their adoption for some of the reasons you mention - people have to exchange their money back and forth etc. Without adoption wider than investment and buying stuff on the dark web or other cryptos etc etc. I struggle to see BTC being more than a fringe currency useful for some limited sectors, a relatively volatile commodity, and a facilitator for developing new fintech.

I am new to BTC as well. I bought my first BTC on Friday/saturday, and the price is more or less back to where it was then. For what it is worth, I am not worried. If it falls much further, I will probably buy more.
 You can easily find the last 7 years of bitcoin/USD. It fairly often has corrections, the worst looks like it was around 50% of its value. But several have been around 20-30%. But in the months after it has almost always achieved a new all time high. 
However - what has happened in the past is no guarantee of what will happen in the future, of course. There is no certainty it will achieve a new ATH. BTC is still new enough that it is very volatile. But as the technology is developed and uptake improves, the price has gone up.
So..., you are presumably looking at long term trends, and the trend has typically been up, with some corrections and plateaus along the way. This is because, I think, the underlying faith in the technology and concept, both of which are still being developed, leading to greater uptake, growth of number of owners, places you can use BTC, etc. Short term big drops will be driven by the same group think as the ups - 'it is going up so buy now' - pushes the price up. Or some people sell, there is enough worrying amongst BTC owners about the price at the moment that when the price falls, it tumbles.

My guess is a lot of people had order requests at 3000 and the uptick has encouraged people to buy back in. But it may not last long.

I had exactly the same problem. Also pixel XL running Oreo. In the end I could uninstall the app by searching for the app on Google play and uninstalling it from there. I tried a lot of other things that all failed. Now phone working again.

I had the same problem - was about to perform a factory data reset based on advice from android customer support. But managed to find a way to uninstall the app. 
I have a pixel XL running Oreo. All recent updates installed etc.
Every time I used the multitasking button my system ui crashed. Couldn't close the app, couldn't uninstall the app by clicking on the app or with task manager apps. Had to uninstall it via Google play.
