Educate yourself on how mining works.
I've seen this scenario happen with altcoins before when they've tried to reset the difficulty because miners were in a hole too deep to get themselves out of.
What has happened is that they've reset the difficulty to '1' (lowest possible difficulty), and so some early bird profits greatly off the first mined blocks as well as the following 'whipsawing' in difficulty as it ratchets up.
What makes you get 25BTC once every 10 minutes is the difficulty. If the difficulty is matched perfectly to hash rate, then it takes 10 minutes to find a block.
But if hash rate decreases, then it takes longer to find that block, since the difficulty remains the same until the difficulty retarget which is once every 2016 blocks.
If the current hash rate were to drop by 99%, it would take ~16.5 hours to find a block.

Block size has nothing to do with it, at all

Price going below cost of electricity for 99% of all miners

Again, has nothing to do with the problem.
Whether you put all transactions in a single block or not, that single block still takes 16.5 hours for one confirmation, and several days for six confirmations. The network would come to a virtual standstill.

Yes, with a low difficulty such as '1' it can easily be done.
For 100BTC/second, you would need to mine 4 blocks at 0.25 seconds each
time = difficulty * 2**32 / hashrate
0.25 seconds = Difficulty of 1 x 4294967296 / 17179869184 hashes/s
That means it only takes ~17.18 GH/s to mine 100BTC in one second assuming difficulty is '1'.
For reference, the best miners today do 6000GH/s each.
To prevent this from occurring, the difficulty retarget would need to occur more often than once every four blocks (currently its 2016 blocks). The problem with retargeting every block, or once every handful of blocks, is that you get a 'whipsaw' effect, where block 1 is very hard to mine, block 2 very easy, block 3 very hard, block 4 very easy, etc.
