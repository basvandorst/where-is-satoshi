8 is the year. The Letter designation is the month the contract expires. For example, ZBZ7 is the 30 year Treasury futures contract expiring this month. Volume rolls over to the next contract many weeks before expiration though.

"stock, options, forex trader". Right in the title. Futures are a unique instrument, although it could be argued that forex is also a futures contract, albeit very short term. Exchange traded futures don't roll and there isn't swap.

It's pretty easy to setup. The quick start guide is simple.
You have to use Chrome browser &amp; install Chrome apps. Each coin has a Chrome app that you install. There is also a manager app that is used to add/remove coin support on the physical decice and do firmware updates on your Ledger.
While the app interface is very similar to a software wallet, the unique security of the ledger is that you use the buttons on the ledger itself to enter your PIN and navigate menus. That part is totally inaccessible from the PC (or Mac). Any transaction you do on the PC, done just like a wallet, has to be confirmed with the buttons on the Ledger device.
So far, it's only weakness is that it is PC or Mac only.... for now.

Still seems to be a lot of confusion as to what a taxable event is. Is transferring to a Ledger going to be taxable? Because pretty much everyone should be transferring out anything bigger than pocket change.
This is going to be ridiculously difficult for those who use crypto as it was intended: as a currency. They basically have to reverse engineer their cost basis for every single time they use it. This is very unrealistic. Do we have to calculate inflation losses for every dollar of fiat we spend? Because it's equivalent.

Which markets? The worlds largest, the CME? Hardly. Making spoofing illegal is an attempt by people who don't know what they are doing to control something they don't understand. 
And it's very legitimate. How would you like it if you decided to cash out your 401k  at 250, but when it's liquidated you find out your average exit price was 210 because the broker wasn't allowed to work out of the positon? 
Trying to make something like spoofing illegal is an attempt to legislate based on ideology rather than reality by someone who doesn't know how markets work.

The idea that spoofing has been banned in regulated markets is ludicrous. They give lip service and make a human sacrifice ever so often to appease the herd.

someone who gets it. Rather than whining "it's not fair", you're thinking about how you can arbitrage this. 
The thing about trading the order book is that it is not black and white. Size moves the market, how price reacts to volume is key. Large orders can both attract and repel price. Without seeing what actually traded at these prices and tracking how much was added and pulled from each level, you're trading with incomplete information. Also, the order book is irrelevant more than a few price points away from current. Huge size resting several dollars away is meaningless. How that size reacts as price approaches &amp; hits it is what's important. If it builds or holds, it's legit support/resistance. That doesn't mean price will stop though. If price actually consumes it, then you want to be on board &amp; not fading it. That tells you traders were willing to trade in spite of that volume and whoever had orders resting there is wrong (for now).

Nothing new. This happens every moment in every market. And has been that way since markets began. And it will continue as long as markets exist. The only difference is that liquidity in most markets prevents the movesfrom being very large. 
The article makes it sound like printing your own money, but it is extremely risky. Building a position that large can destroy you if there isn't sufficient liquidity to exit that positon. Remember, the only way they can profit off that move is if they can find enough buyers at higher prices. Just as they move price up by trading so much size, they will also move the market against themselves trying to exit.

Unless it goes to 7000, then pulls back to 5000. Then anyone who sold now is going to be seriously bent. 
As a professional trader, I can tell you it is impossible to time an irrational market. Runaway trends always go farther than anyone thinks they will. And the more irrational the impulse up, the more severe the correction. 
4k could be the top with a 50% correction coming. Or it could go to 10k and only pull back to 7 or 8k.  Nobody knows.

Really? It's been a part of markets since the beginning of time and will continue to be so. The more press that cryptos get, the more experienecd speculators will be drawn. If you're speculating in these markets, I suggest you adapt. Because spoofing can't be stopped, nor should it. 
It's a legitimate technique used to move size. Large players wouldn't stand a chance of getting their orders filled without moving the market against themselves otherwise. 
From the very beginning deception has been used by the large players in markets. Whether it's Abdul selling sheep (when he's actually hired a dozen guys to buy net long against his selling) or Vanguard simultaneously working both the bid &amp; offer while liquidating your 401k.
The only alternative is for them to broadcast their intentions. Who would be stupid enough to take the other side?

I don't regulary trade cryptos. Mainly buy more on dips. I'm looking for especially large volume spikes at V bottoms. 
If I were to see an obscenely large volume spike at the top of a large move up, I'd consider liquidating some of my BTC. But never all as you don't want to be stuck on the sidelines if it doesn't pullback. Basically, I'm building an inventory of cryptos, trading small portions of it within the larger position. 
As for "a living", I daytrade Treasury Futures. Buying at the high when I see lots of volume consuming all the liquidity. I get out as soon as it hits a wall. Typically 3-5 ticks. When I'm wrong, I typically only lose 1-2 ticks at most. It's tedious work, but it pays. 
My point was that "high" &amp; "low" are an illusion. They can only be defined after the fact. "buy low, sell hi" seems so clear, but in reality it is very foggy.

Same. I'm 45 and haven't felt this good in 15 years. I've drifted from pure keto, I still kept the carbs under 20, but the real magic is in a high-fat intake. Best way to break a stall is to increase fats.... A lot. I recently bumped my morning fat intake up substantially &amp; rediscovered that awesome place where you don't have to eat again all day. And the scale started dropping again. But mainly I do it for the anti-inflammatory benefits. Losing weight is just to reduce the strain on my back and knees.

Distance is an issue. Doesn't do much good to find a $500 car if it costs me another $500 in fuel &amp; time to travel 1,000 miles to get it. Then you either need a second person or a trailer to get it.
Regardless.... the issue is frugality. Something like 90% of lottery winners file bankruptcy within 5 years. Because they have an unhealthy relationship with money. Most who experience tremendous gains in crypto will be no different.

Outstanding opportunity to short Bitcoin right now. At least for anyone who isn't emotionally invested on the long side. Flip this chart upside down and there wouldn't be a question that this is a prime buying spot. I'm totally selling here. 
Edit (6 days later) ; approaching the take profit target now. $4225 down through $3500. Traders are trying to push this below 3500 to run all those stops just below it. Easy 20% profit, took almost zero heat &amp; very low risk trade for an outstanding profit. It will likely bounce off 3500 as longs attempt to defend that price. But the shorts are simply accumulating more &amp; more. Once it drops through 3500 they will unload onto the all panic sellers for a profit. 
The thing all the bitcoin purists fail to understand is that this is a market now &amp; will behave as such. It's price is controlled by the big fish &amp; a you can do is follow. But they are predictable. They move price, seeking liquidity. They accumulate massive positions, moving the market as they do so. They need to find liquidity to unload their positions. The typical retail trader &amp; investor is doing the exact opposite and becomes chum for the whales.

Maybe it will. Maybe it won't. All I know was at that moment (when it failed to retest 20k and made a new low), it was no longer going up.
If it fails to break $3500 and makes a new high, then it will no longer be going down.... At that moment. That can always change. But the one thing you cannot ever do with investments is just sit back and let half or more of your capital evaporate. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 19:15:36

Rule  in markets is that they are likely to continue doing what they have been doing... Until they are doing something else. Right now they are going down. They will continue to go down until they are going up. A four year old could look at a chart and tell you that it's going down.
In fact, I highly suggest you find yourself a toddler. Every month, show them a chart and ask then if it's going up or down. Only when they say "up" do you buy.

The part that all the "average down" parrots never cover. If you keep buying in a bear market, you'll eventually run out of bullets. And you keep getting further and further away from your breakeven price. Dollar cost averaging is a concept for stock markets where you know central banks will step in to stop a decline.

Voluntary acceptance doesn't make it any less of a fiat. It is backed by nothing. It has no intrinsic value. Inflation doest define fiat, the lack of any intrinsic value does. Commodties ALL have intrinsic value. 
Don't make this an attack against cryptos. I believe that the internet has made fiat money a necessity. Any other form of money will have a problem with either portability or divisibility. The real issue is that so far all fiat has been government controlled. And governments have proven themselves unable to resist the lure of inflating the money supply. That is what makes cryptos unique amongst the world of fiat. Fiat in and of itself isn't a problem. Governments are.

Waiting for the wailing and gnashing of teeth over profiting over others suffering.... 
Statists would rather people starve than have the opportunity to buy goods at unregulated prices.

At least the mafia holds it's members accountable when they fuck up.

This is convenient. Like drugs or hacking... they need to get the general public to get on board with their agenda. Which is to ultimately get full control over the internet and cryptocurrencies. 
Banks aren't a threat to government, quite the opposite. Cryptocurrencies and a free internet are the greatest theats to government supremacy. Gotta create the problem before you can offer the cure. That's their modus operandi.

You buy dips in a BULL market. This is a collapse. When a 2 year old can look at the chart and see that it's going up, then and only then do you buy dips.

IKR..... The taxes I had to pay on all the crypto that I sold last Christmas were terrifying.

That's opportunity cost, not a loss. But it is real. If we were to have a major recession right now, there's a lot of people who will be unable to take advantage of fire-sale prices because they decided to ride out this crypto bear market. That's opportunity cost. It could be 10-20 years before you get another shot at those opportunities
