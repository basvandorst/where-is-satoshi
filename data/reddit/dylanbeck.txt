Check the preauthorization or pending transaction tabs with your bank.
What exchange did you use

Ah, I’m not sure about coinbank never used it.
I think it should be well.
Probably flooded servers due to price increase

For more clarification. I recieved this text out of nowhere, it claims I have recieved 35 BTC. My coinbase is linked to my phone number and I have never posted my contact information publicly before.
Has anyone seen this before?
Can someone explain how I have been targeted? Or, why I have been targeted?
I hold very little crypto in my coinbase, however I have been trading on GDAX/Coinbase since the companies inception and have very high limits due to being an early adopter of Coinbase and passing lots of money through their portal.
Thank you.

I didnt intend to humblebrag, im just supplying information to aid someone with providing answers.
If it came across that way I apologize. I do not have a giant stash of BTC, I spent most of it when it was still valued sub 1000 USD.

I use my own Ledger wallet, I traded on GDAX for a long time because I hated driving to the western union to use localbitcoins. Convenience is key, thats part of their business  model. I happen to be a customer that falls into their demographic of “convenience &gt; non-convenience”
