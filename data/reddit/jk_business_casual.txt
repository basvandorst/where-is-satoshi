Do you live in perpetual fear that tomorrow your dollars will inflate away to the point where basic necessities are unaffordable?
Do you expect tomorrow to wake up to mass unemployment and riots in the streets?
If your answer to either question is yes you may be reading too many tabloids. Make no mistake, there are many issues plaguing the American economy, but lack of stability is not one of them.

I live on my own with no support from my parents and I'm putting myself through university through regular work and smart investing. You make the mistake of assuming that everyone in the US and Europe is living in a high-rent area and taking out student loans. I'm not living "entirely on the side of the equation that benefits from stealing from the poor" because I earn my money in dollars same as you.
You're being extremely melodramatic by saying that a stable 2% inflation rate is costing millions of people their lives. You know what will really cost them their lives? A deflationary dollar when they lose their jobs cause every shareholder in the world puts their money in the bank instead of investing it in companies that pay wages.

I want you to know that I read your response in full and loved it. Definitely a voice of reason. I'm also against the idea that everyone who isn't pro-Bitcoin is immediately in a conspiracy to crush it (especially the banks). I'd give you gold if I weren't a piss-poor university student.

You sound like that British guy (was it Nigel Farage?) who said "the people have had enough of experts" lol
Listen, I'm a student with a part time job. This hasn't stopped me from saving money to invest in the stock market and Bitcoin. I believe that class mobility is still alive and strong, and coming from a former Communist country I can tell you that the situation in the West isn't nearly as bad (from an economic point of view) as the tabloids would have you believe.
Does fiat have its issues? Sure, but so far it's the best thing we've ever had. If the world had remained on the gold standard, I have no doubt that each recession since then would've been significantly worse.

What you're envisioning has a far darker outcome than you believe. Just read [the Investopedia article]( for a quick intro.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:50:22
Imagine it like this: BTC becomes the global currency, and it's annual deflation is 5%.
By definition, this means that the only time people will invest their BTC is when they can earn more than 5% per year. In the current climate, this is a very high rate of return (for traditional investments). You're free to google the return on investment rates of major corporations. Each one with less than 5% will shut down in our hypothetical BTC-denominated economy.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:00:18
I'd agree with you if Bitcoin was solely functioning as a currency. In my mind right now it functions more similarly to digital gold, and unless something truly major happens (like Coinbase getting hacked and losing everyone's money), I think this is the path Bitcoin will continue treading.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:47:46
You're correct, at present Bitcoin does experience inflation (although, you have to consider whether that's more than the amount of coins lost during the same time).
You're also right that the deflationary nature of Bitcoin is in no way a hamper to it. I'm talking more about Bitcoin's future aspirations as a competitive global currency, which I believe is still a ways off. First checkpoint is digital gold.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:46:40
Deflation simply means that monetary supply can't be increased. This is a natural cause of Bitcoin's limited 21 mil supply (which only gets smaller as people lose their private keys).

The Great Recession came about because of excessive greed and hubris on the part of many groups of people, both regular Joes taking out mortgage upon mortgage and asset managers playing the real-estate version of musical chairs. It most definitely wasn't orchestrated in a shady backroom by Wall Street experts, as the Big Short would have you believe.
You're correct that economists can have differing opinions, but this is valid for every science in the world. The only thing that matters is which opinions are validated by real-life evidence. So far, the bulk of modern economic experience points to the fact that a low, stable amount of inflation is healthy for the economy.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:29:54
I think the biggest hurdle to becoming a world currency is the lack of monetary levers. The issues you described are what's currently holding Bitcoin from becoming a *good* currency, whereas to convince a government to adopt Bitcoin is a much taller task.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:01:03


I'd argue that there should be no such thing as a risk-free rate, but that's a completely different topic. Anyway, if you check the rate on treasuries (which are about as close to risk-free as you can get, since they're backed by the US government), the longer-dated ones to have a positive return.
Long-term risk is always a factor, but consider the past: after WW2 you had decades where the world was literally one circuit malfunction from nuclear Armageddon. Today, the world is more interconnected than ever. Everyone with wealth and power across the world has money in the US in one form or another, so departing from the status quo is in nobody's interest.
Note that I don't condone or promote crony capitalism. I just recognize that this is the current state of affairs, whether we like it or not. Changing it would be a multi-generational effort and I have no doubt that Bitcoin is part of the solution. It's just important that we keep sight of the global context in which Bitcoin is developing. We aren't living in the Great Depression, nor during the Cold War. We live in the era of globalization, where everything is far too interconnected for something truly bad to happen (intentionally).
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:53:11
The thing though is that lost coins aren't a linear monotonic number. You can have just 50 BTC lost one year and then Coinbase HQ burning down the next year. That's why predictability of inflation/deflation is vital for the stability of any currency.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:23:51
It might not be a static 5% every year, but that's even worse. Imagine one year only enough bitcoins are mined to achieve 1% deflation. The next year Coinbase HQ burns down and a fifth of all BTC in existence are lost forever. That's not a scenario you'd enjoy being part of.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:39:32
Sure, we don't need government adoption right now (or even in the next decade). I'm talking about the eventual future people envision, where there is no fiat. For that to happen, governments must willingly adopt Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:25:42
  &gt;All the great empires in the past crumbled when inflation was out of control.
Yes, hyperinflation has been the bane of many regimes. But ...


... no, economic levers are what keeps inflation in check. You counteract inflation and keep it within your target range *thanks to* economic levers, not despite them.

Well, the (American) economy looks pretty stable to me.
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:09:58
I'm not nearly enough of an expert on crypto, but as far as I know monetary policy isn't a simple math equation you can automate as part of the decentralized consensus. If it were possible there'd be no need for the FOMC, for example. Thus, dictating monetary policy requires the flexibility and expertise of professional economists. Maybe there's a way to incorporate a crypto-FOMC without compromising the decentralization cornerstone of Bitcoin, but I myself can't imagine how that might look.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:22:12


What's with this "us vs. them" mentality? You think I'd be talking up economics and bitcoin on Reddit if I was an investment banker? lol
I believe that economics is a social science. This is because, at its heart, it attempts to predict the behavior of large masses of people under specific, mathematically quantifiable circumstances. In light of this, comparing it to philosophy is very disingenuous.
I also don't think that mankind is on "the edge of a cliff" as you so eloquently put it. I am fairly certain that my dollars today will purchase roughly 2% less than they will next year, and then 2% less the year after that. This encourages me to invest my dollars in places where they will be productive, in order to increase my rate of return to beat inflation. I can use them to start a business, or buy stocks in growing companies or even just buying government bonds. In any case, this is only possible because the money supply can expand and contract in order to control the expansion/contraction of the economy. This would be impossible under a deflationary or gold-standard currency.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:21:00
If you're truly an economist, surely you realize the very simple reason why Bitcoin can never replace fiat: it is deflationary.
That might be good for hodlers like you and I, but it is absolutely not something you can build an economy on. If Bitcoin were to replace the USD right now (ignoring scalability issues, etc.), most commerce would grind to a halt because it would be more profitable to just hold your coins than invest / spend them on anything.
You as an economist should well realize that monetary policy exists for a reason. It's not there so that the big 'ol Fed can steal 2% of your money every year. It's there to encourage everyone to invest and spend, and (most importantly) to prevent another shit show like the Great Depression (which, as I'm sure you know, was made twice as worse due to the gold standard).
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:59:15
Everyone pretending Wall Street is this collective institution getting ready to steal Joe Schmo's $1000 in Bitcoin is hilarious.
What's gonna happen in reality is that a bunch of asset managers and investment firms of various sizes are going to be betting each against each other on the price of BTC, and the ones going long will have a vested interest in spreading the word.
Whoever here thinks that Mr. Wall Street can just short 1 million BTC futures out of thin air should head on over to Investopedia and actually learn how this shit works instead of spreading disinformation.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:54:23
I agree that rampant consumerism is an existential threat to mankind, but I disagree with the notion that deflationary currency is the answer.
We're still very far as a society from the point where we can consider economic growth (specifically, growth in consumption) as an obsolete measure. Remember that the human population is still rising at a significant rate, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.
I think the answer is in promoting regulated capitalism with a specific focus on sustainability. Things like carbon taxes, while an imperfect solution, are still a step in the right direction which I would vote for.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:46:46


So you imply that anyone who isn't living paycheck to paycheck is "privileged"? I'm sorry, but that's absurd and goes against the grain of the American spirit. Just because I'm good with budgeting to be able to save money from working while I study doesn't make me privileged.
Holding fiat was never the idea, and if everyone holds their fiat instead of investing them the whole economy dies. Nobody decides to start new companies, nobody buys new equipment. A deflationary spiral is the death of an economy, flat and simple. There's no talk here about privilege or "stealing from the poor", it's just basic math.
But let's tackle your point of "privilege". Right now, it is easier than any time in history for the average person to invest. You have Robinhood making it literally a few clicks away from owning stock. Just 20 years ago something like this would be unheard of.
I highly recommend attending an introductory econ lecture. The paragraphs you wrote down have no basis in reality.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:50:41
Judging by the first few paragraphs, the paper seems to be making a false dichotomy: it's not an either/or between quantitative growth and qualitative development.
Every year the human population increases (quantitative growth) while simultaneously technology improves, thus increasing our productivity (qualitative development). I think the current model we have right now is fine, as long as sustainability becomes an actual goal rather than a PR exercise.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:48:06
Fiat absolutely has its flaws. I do, however, think that it is the best option we've had so far. Perhaps crypto will mature enough eventually to surpass it, hopefully we'll see in the coming years!
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:51:41
The BTC of today to me functions more as a store of value than a currency. If I had to bet on the future, I think that Bitcoin will become an asset class investors buy similar to gold/silver, i.e. in order to hedge against inflation and global risk.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:44:58
If you honestly think 2017 is anything remotely close to what happened during the Great Depression, you need to open up a textbook and read about it. You should also check out [the Investopedia article on deflation]( to learn why it's not actually "protecting you from the Feds" lol

I suggest you check the order book of gdax to see just how little liquidity there is in Bitcoin (hint, most major NASDAQ stocks individually have larger order books). So yeah, to crash the price 5% would take much less than you think.

If you just keep the Bitcoin without cashing out to fiat then you shouldn't pay capital gains tax, since most countries still don't have specific regulations on that. But when you do cash it out, you owe your country of residence (and the US if you're a citizen, regardless of where you live) this tax because you're part of that society and benefit from its existence. If nobody paid tax society would crumble and we'd be back to the Stone age.
