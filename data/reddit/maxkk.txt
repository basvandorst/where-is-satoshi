Might go there tomorrow!
@_date: 2015-12-26 09:53:22
Do you think this is likely?
@_date: 2015-05-22 20:49:44
No, it was $600 worth of BTC. You can't use the future ATH for this. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 14:05:37
Captain? :)
@_date: 2015-05-10 18:13:50
Crypti has 10-second block time. Working all nicely. :) 
@_date: 2015-05-21 08:46:16
Another crowd funded project called Crypti will deliver in the coming months. Decentralized applications for everyone. :)
@_date: 2015-01-20 13:05:29
Via Counterparty, the better ones (but still small and not important) are on the Nxt asset exchange through.
@_date: 2015-01-09 13:23:37
I and my local group (Bitcoin-Aachen.de) will contact our local sparkasse, if they really do this I will change my bank.  
@_date: 2016-03-13 17:09:39
Not sure about the details. But you are about right.
@_date: 2016-03-13 13:27:49
Bter 2.0. ;) 
The achievement was already accomplish.
@_date: 2017-03-27 05:12:13
Can we get the links to Peter's tweet and BU's commit? 
@_date: 2019-06-01 18:24:13
For Lisk Mobile we are using: 
@_date: 2015-08-01 06:47:50
Working for me. 
@_date: 2015-07-03 07:37:34
One representative of them contacted me a while ago, he was very curious about Nxt. This shows, that they are very interested into Bitcoin and crypto currencies in general. Not the general blockchain masterrace crap. :) We are making progress, folks. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 18:21:57
I would like to see a liquidity/balance proof at any time I want. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 13:03:14
I'm living in Aachen and I sadly see the same, Germany is the enemy of innovation and startups. I just founded an university group at one of the biggest technical excellence universities in Germany and hope, that at least the academic environment is innovation friendly. 
@_date: 2015-07-28 06:40:45
They are making bold decisions now, but that's the only chance for them to shine again. 
@_date: 2017-04-25 04:55:11
Check out BURST. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 18:30:38
Life will give you many huge opportunities. If you see them in Bitcoin now, you will see them in other things in the future as well. So get as educated as you can, while you can.
@_date: 2018-04-17 06:54:16
If any of the designers here want to move to Berlin and work on a blockchain project, PM me.
@_date: 2016-10-04 06:45:40
Will the presentations be recorded? Can we get the PPT presentations later?
@_date: 2016-10-22 15:47:19
I never had any problems with them. They are honest, there is absolutely no doubt about it.
Right now it's weekend that's why they probably respond slowly. ;)
@_date: 2016-10-02 09:05:09
Yesterday night I was at a school reunion. Many friends of mine know that I'm involved in the cryptocurrency scene. There was one guy which I didn't know and he didn't know me. He was talking about OneCoin. 
He told me that it definitely is legit. His wife is a friend of mine, so I wanted to help him and we had a conversation. He was dead sold on OneCoin. At the point he told me that there will be 120,000,000,000 coins and the current 'value' of 6€/coin is sustainable, I just left. 
These people are sad.. 
@_date: 2015-11-12 19:39:44
It's beyond me why so many people still use them anymore. The same thing happened with Mt.Gox and everyone was looking away. People are getting burned there soon.
@_date: 2015-10-05 15:25:26
Can someone make a few screenshots of the UI? 
@_date: 2015-10-09 09:41:04
Google has YouTube and G+. These platforms would be great for tipping Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-10-19 15:15:14
Trades on the platform are working. But they are useless if you can't withdraw or deposit XCR since months. ;)
@_date: 2015-03-29 15:15:26
From where in Germany are you? Why you need one?
@_date: 2015-10-10 16:28:08
When did you contact them yesterday? What time? 
@_date: 2017-05-20 05:45:35
I'm in New York! Next time. 
@_date: 2015-10-14 19:43:16
One can have 2 exchange accounts. ;)
@_date: 2015-10-14 14:57:13
Are there alternatives?
@_date: 2015-10-24 09:27:57
Crypti as a smart contract / dapp platform is missing as well. 
@_date: 2015-10-06 13:37:08
I think yes, because the BTC for the ETF will be bought on Gemini. 
@_date: 2015-10-19 14:11:21
It isn't. Many wallets are down, some like XCR since half a year and longer. Cryptsy is dead. 
@_date: 2015-10-19 20:34:34
This is the most illogical comment I ever read. It's like you should convert your YEN to USD, because the USD is the "money of all currencies" and will never go away.
@_date: 2017-05-17 07:28:50
I saw this machine multiple times already. Can I buy it somewhere?
@_date: 2015-03-04 09:19:59
It's the ™ joke.
@_date: 2017-07-06 08:11:08
At least one would not pay 10,000 LSK for a pizza anymore. 
@_date: 2015-10-01 18:24:50
Ich hoffe auf Golem.de! 
@_date: 2015-10-31 09:40:02
In Germany it's very easy. Go to Bitcoin.de, choose a sell offer, transfer the money, wait 2-3 days.
@_date: 2015-10-10 18:05:23
Ok, so it's weekend. Obviously nobody will answer you. If, then it's a sign of good support. 
@_date: 2015-11-11 22:38:52
RemindMe! 1 year "Was it the correct decision?"
@_date: 2017-07-05 14:29:19
Quick note; Lieferheld once accepted Bitcoin already and then merged with Lieferando, they promised for a very long time now to re-add Bitcoin payments. Now they finally did it.
@_date: 2015-10-21 16:47:28
Not only the GUI, with new developers they can finally fix all their broken wallets. Crypti is broken for over 6 months now. 
@_date: 2016-07-31 14:55:51
Is there an updated one?
