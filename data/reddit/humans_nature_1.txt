Nobody's stopping Bitcoin from staying exactly the way it is. But it won't get as big as Bitcoiners think it will in its current state. For one, it will never be taken seriously as a world currency as long as the early adopter advantage exists. Two, people will start seeing it as a bad investment because the only way to make money off of it is if someone comes and buys it after you do (the pyramid scheme part).
@_date: 2014-06-12 21:45:26
Do you think these will be worth less than other bitcoins because they're "tainted" or will people not give a shit since they're still bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-08-17 07:53:44
Well are you talking about inflation of the fiat supply due to money printing by the fed? If so, this new system would do away with that and operate similar to how Bitcoin does now. Just the initial distribution would occur by proof of burn instead of people buying at whatever inflated speculative value Bitcoin has at the moment.
If you're talking about inflation of prices of goods and services that will always happen depending on economic output and resource scarcity.
In fact some economists would argue that if you did away with inflationary control it might lead to unintended consequences. Obviously this power has been abused by governments, but if you completely take away that tool it might be difficult to smooth the transition to different periods of wealth fluctuation.

Thanks! Yes I agree central banks have similar flaws due to corruption but the controls are better than nothing. If we had capitalism combined with Bitcoin as the reserve currency it would mean even greater swings in the world economy.

No because you're buying a profit share or an asset in those cases. Or in forex you're buying a currency backed by a government with an army and assets and control over monetary supply. Here the only thing protecting your savings in Bitcoin is your fellow holders not deciding to dump for another currency. There's no stabilization. Some argue that if Bitcoin just nabs enough global market share volatility will decrease but that just means that volatility would be transferred to the global economy. There's a reason central banks exist to dampen currency effects. Bitcoin is neat but it's a toy compared to country backed currencies.

I'm thinking the algorithm change suggested in the thread you linked is the likely outcome of all this. I think it might even happen soon. Why bother with constant threats from a pool getting close to 51%? Obviously ASIC R&amp;D for that algorithm would instantly go through the roof but it might give enough time for Bitcoin developers to put their full undivided attention towards solving this issue once and for all.

Blackcoin. 10 second transaction times and almost no mining overhead because of POS. Also no selling pressure from miners.
I think I hear a lot of overly negative sentiment towards alt coins on this sub, perhaps people are scared of competition. And they should be, there is clearly a large interest in some of them and they may very well out-innovate Bitcoin. 
I think the market cap of altcoins is probably going to be the majority in the next few years.

If your address is linked to a credit card such as when you buy on Coinbase, you can't. especially with lots of coins, mixing is effectively impossible. That's why so many alt coins are trying to provide anonymity at the protocol level such as Darkcoin, Monero, and Zerocash. Bitcoin can be used pretty anonymously though if you buy from a stranger with cash at Starbucks or something. Just look on local Bitcoins or Craigslist or whatever if you're trying to be discrete. You'll have to pay a premium for the service though.

@_date: 2014-08-17 06:56:39
You're right. I took that line out. I'll try to explain my idea better.
The exchange rate would be 1:1 with the fiat system. The supply would simply be a digital representation of all the fiat that had been burned for those coins. At any time someone could opt to join in the new coin but each coin would be the same as 1 "dollar".
@_date: 2014-08-17 07:00:54

Nope. Just having a discussion about my idea. I'm running into overly defensive Bitcoin bagholders as expected. I hold Bitcoin myself.

I'll try to explain it in a different way. I take issue with you giving the advice of simply "not selling" as if that isn't an overly simplified strategy that isn't good for much of anything. That isn't trading. It isn't particularly useful to anyone but you. All your post does is make people feel better who have already decided to hold.

Who cares about my opinion on fairness? The general public who hasn't bought into Bitcoin yet because they rightly perceive it as a pyramid scheme. Every person who buys Bitcoin drives the price up higher which benefits early adopters the most. By buying Bitcoin you make early adopters richer. As the last guy to buy Bitcoin, at best you break even.

The problem with this thinking is you're treating it as a stock. It can't be a stock and a currency. Nobody will ever accept that except for people who try to profit off the pyramid scheme.

All of the things you mentioned could be fixed by modifying Bitcoin or by altcoins that already exist.
* It's very inefficient - Proof of Stake.
* It's easy to steal - regulation, new protocol, future services that haven't been invented yet?
* It's very hard and expensive for law enforcement... - same as 
* If you forget your key - same as 
Do the benefits outweigh those challenges? Well almost everything we do with regular money electronically today could be modified to work with Bitcoin. The banks you trust with your money, and who might give you interest, loans, credit or payment methods could all be made to work with Bitcoin. Except you also have the option for the first time of being your own electronic debit account without the need for a bank or exorbitant fees for transferring money.

To add on to this, I see Bitcoin potentially lasting for a couple decades or more used as a mix of forex trading, money laundering, and international remittance, at least until something fundamentally cryptographically or structurally superior comes along that has features Bitcoin can't mimic. As mining rewards decrease we may see the price return to the low thousands of dollars but probably not much more unless the technology sees a radical innovation that dramatically alters its value for investors.

My miner's motherboard lit on fire so actually, technically I got close.

I think I saw this place on the travel channel once. This looks like a dream. I'd probably spend way too much time just chilling down there.

Ok so why are you suggesting he might retract his videos?
@_date: 2014-06-22 12:30:15
That is approximately the current dollar value of all the bitcoins.

I understand that I just wonder what the retraction comment was about. As if he would have a motivation to retract it or someone influential in the community thinks he should.

I have a comment in this thread that is hidden due to excessive downvotes. I've only seen that elsewhere in Reddit when someone said something excessively offensive such as racial slurs. It just goes to show you the mentality in this subreddit. People are sensitive that their investment will be threatened. So they try to hide any criticisms.

Very interesting post, thanks for sharing. More people should be aware of the implications of this.

Thanks I'll check it out tomorrow appreciate it.

So it's Trezorcoin.

I've read up on this and it's not effortless. You need like 70% of the staked coins depending on what source you read, it's pretty technical and I don't know the stuff myself. It's possible to kill PoS coins early on with a few BTC just buy buying them all and staking them yourself and forking it. But coins with millions cap it becomes expensive. But I'm not familiar with how or if they could defork if they didn't have checkpoints.

Well it's not a big deal then!

I'm not "some person off the street". And setting up a node doesn't make you a genius. Also the code has nothing to do with the economic implications. You're being pedantic and trying to divert from the point of my argument.

Can you tell us what those were? It's harder to Google this stuff than you think.

The only question that's relevant here : does Wells Fargo, Chase, or Wall Street exchanges host on the cloud? I mean honestly, do they? If they do I guess there's a precedent for a financial institution doing that.

My point is he defends Bitcoin as usably secure if only you use Trezor, which is ridiculous because you're basically admitting that using this currency safely is only practical if you buy some little gadget, rather than it being purely software based.
@_date: 2017-03-04 22:13:44
Bitcoin still doesn't have much of a use case and the political infighting over technological issues is a concern. The current tepid valuation is legitimate imo.

It wouldn't be distributed really. It would just be a network for sending fiat like any other system. The difference is that in transferring all the fiat to this new system monetary control would transfer from the government to the protocol.

This seems like a very appropriate post to finally get me to unsub from this cult. Good riddance.

It's also the most important one because nobody is going to mine for peanuts.
