Thank you :)

Well, I believed the same thing too, when I tried transfering my BTC from Kapiton to Bitstamp, and nothing happened for three days. Sent a support ticket, got no answer. Asked around, and some said it just took time. And, after a little over a week, my transfer went through.  
  
Now I don't know what the hell they're doing over there, but it seems things are just taking a lot of time - why would they process things like this if they were going to steal them? But on the other hand, I understand you're worried since it's been longer for you..  
  
All I can say is, I hope it works out for you in the end!

Two hours. Two hours since this was posted, for the price to go down to ~$975 and is now back up at ~$1100. So a day or so more and we're back at $1200 again. So not really a huge deal then.

lol, now we're almost at 12k again. Under 10k will probably not happen. Under 9? No.

Well, that didn't go very well did it? We're already almost at 12k again ;) Can't see how we would ever drop below 10k anytime soon.

Well how about that, might as well wait a week then, thanks!

Gotcha! As the other comment mentioned, I might as well wait a week and trade it directly on Bitstamp :)
