Thanks for the reply.
Probably going to (my) blockchain.info wallet, that I believe supports Bcash now but the coins were another wallet at the time of the fork.
So my private keys from the wallet that held the coin on Aug. 1, are being imported to the blockchain.info wallet?
Not sure of the mechanics of that information import.  Further explanation appreciated ....

I am a former Business School professor and have been following the bitcoin space since about 2011.  In 2015 I wrote and self published a book about a new world of mulitple (non-fiat) choices of currencies and ways to transmute one's value in a society, in the acquisition of goods and services.   It is a thin book and easy read but well researched with appropriate references for someone to go deeper as they wish into the topic.
I carry a copy around with me in my back pack and give it away regularly to people but only when it comes up in conversation and they ask.  People always want to pay me for the book but I give it away.  I find it a meaningful way of sharing what I feel is an essential new world view on how economies work, if we are to have 10+ billion people living meaningful, sustainable lives on our amazing planet.

Open to be corrected but:
1) Was it not in fact DPR (Dread Pirate Roberts) that was responsible for the hirings and it has been found that multiple people had been using the name?
2) I have heard of nothing in RU's character/past that would suggest he would be a likely person to kill or ordering people to be killed.
3) In fact there was no conclusive evidence that anybody was actually killed, for the hirings ....

with ledger, does that mean I can store all/most of my coin on the device and not in my on-line wallet?

Interesting speech.  Sounded like a diplomatic way of saying "we surrender".   Interesting footnote to public statements made by Bank of England officials, is the speech by Andrew Haldane, Executive Director of the Bank of England, Oct. 29, 2012, delivered at the Friends House Quaker Hall in London.  It was the first central banking, public admonition of the problem: "Occupy Wall Street has been successful in its efforts to popularize the problems of the global financial system, for one simple reason: they are right !"  (See BBC Article, "Bank of England Andrew Haldane: Occupy Played a Key Role")

There need not be a top spot.  i.e. multiple currencies for multiple applications, that's the point.  A healthy financial ecosystem, like a healthy forest, is diversified.  Sacred economics.  Multiple ways to transmute one's value as a person, into a means to acquire goods and services.  No one need be "broke".

Always liked "Bucky".   And of course his other great quote so applicable to BTC today: "“In order to change an existing paradigm you do not struggle to try and change the problematic model. You create a new model and make the old one obsolete.”

Thanks !                                                                              Is there an equally clear post or article on how to claim Bcash and BTC Gold fork coins?  I had some BTC in 2 different previous wallets (now all in an off-line cold storage wallet) and the 2 previous wallets don't seem to have info on this.

Great post.
Disagree that Trump is a "nationalist" but actually a "Trumpist".   The first time I heard about Trumpcoin (see [trumpcoin.com]( my thought was that his long term plan is to - by decree - replace the US dollar with the trumpcoin as the defacto currency for all US trade.  He instantly becomes, by far, the richest person on the planet.

Kathleen's "friend" got in at $19,000.  I have a feeling it was her and don't think she's a HODL'r

Left out Andrew Haldane's - Chancellor of the Bank of England - opinion given at a public speech given Oct. 29, 2012 at the Quaker Hall in London, where he says central banks have failed at social banking and the "Occupy Wall Street was right".

Sorry for the dumb question but does that mean out of on-line wallet services and onto a hardware wallet device such as Trezor or other cold storage mediums?
