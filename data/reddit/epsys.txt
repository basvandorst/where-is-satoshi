Nobody buys anything with gold but it is valuable because it is a fantastic store of wealth due to scarcity.

I propose all these threads, if verifiable, get promoted and lauded. At the very least you should get reddit karma for your good deeds.
Also, don't tell us how much it was. Easier to think of it as a fictitious digital currency when transacting this kind of $$$ !!
