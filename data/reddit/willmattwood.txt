That is... wrong.  Money is just a medium of exchange.  A perfect monetary system would be frictionless.  However our current modern form of monetary relies heavily on interest which introduces friction... and therefore consolidates wealth to those who have more of it.

Yep yep yep.  I know nothing about bitcoin but my instincts were right about that 13800 jump... too fast too soon.  Time for bitcoin to mature into a more stable entity.  Stability is good and helps to avoid roller coaster ism that might scare away more cautious entrants.

I recently had a conversation with a hardware EE who was working on integrating bluetooth into traditional tap pass or debit/credit payment hardware.  He said that he sees facial recognition plus consistent tracking will open up the possibility for boundary-less payment methods... ie. Walk into a subway or transit system = automatic deductions... my own 2 cents is this would lead to currency taking a backseat in society and becoming a passive substrate rather than an active gate keeping mechanism.

Yeah this is a fair argument against bakkt.  I personally will never fuck with the nonsense because derivatives are exactly why we need to shift off a centrally cintrolled/printed currency in the first place...    but that being said if the net outcome is increased demand for bitcoin isnt that a good thing?

Hmmm... very interesting point.  But i feel like Bitcoin was never designed to incentivize developers.  Is it possible this is the gap filled by something like ethereum?

My point is that there is a genuine psychological effect of viewing a price as "20,000 satoshis" vs "200 something".   This is not aimed at the core bitcoin base, more as a way of window dressing for those still on the outside looking in.

Wtf are you on about ahaha... i see you are feeling distraught but you might do to learn a bit more about how and why the system works.  Also.... this isn't communism or wealth redistribution.  If you think bitcoin is about making poor people rich then you might need to modify your perspective.  Bitcoin is far simpler than that, and it is powerful precisely because of that simplicity.  Its a new store of value.  Blockchain is nothing more or less than an evolutionary leap in the technology of record keeping... and why is record keeping important?  Look to history.  Look at the massive changes in society that have accompanied truly novel methods or storing information.

My understanding is that BAKKT would have been the one with the obligation to own all of the coins that people are "willing to lose" (or gain).  
Many were very excited about this because it meant that if BAKKT wanted to do large volume bitcoin bets, they would need to fill their "warehouse" by purchasing large amounts of BTC.  If they are fulfilling contracts with fiat then its the same old system, just the buy in is bitcoin instead of fiat... and they probably never did buy all that BTC.

Log is shorthand for logarithmic.  It is usually contrasted with a linear for purposes of graphing two sets of values against each other.  If you look on the left hand side of the graph, instead of moving in "linear" increments (ie. 1,2,3,4,5,6 or evn 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 etc.) It moves in a logarithmic fashion (this graph's example is displaying powers of 10... so 10, 100, 1000, 10000 etc.)  Some phenomena tend towards exponential growth rather than linear growth so shifting the scale from "lin to log" allows for a more visually balanced representation on a graph.

@_date: 2019-09-25 15:43:03
To SHA256?  No.
To public-key cryptography?  Possibly.


I would love to hear from somebody more knowledgeable than myself, but as I understand it, the threat to public-key cryptogrpahy is a more general problem than just as it relates to Bitcoin.  I believe that the security/reliability of \*mining\* is protected by SHA256.


So bitcoin (or rather blockchain's) core function of using hash discovery to mine blocks would still be massively impractical to \*hack\* using current theorized quantum capabilities.  We're talking (again someone please correct me on this!!) trillions of years to crack at 2\^256 difficulty with classical computers, vs 10000 years to crack at 2\^128 difficulty with quantum computers.   So quantum takes a dent out but it's still far beyond practical to say that a quantum computer could start mining coin and overtake the blockchain.  **This is all assuming that we can even get quantum computers stable enough and specifically designed to perform these tasks, and all reports would indicate that this is very far out.**
So... as I understand it, there is a potential threat to cracking private keys (from what I gather these would need to be cracked in the time between a transaction being broadcast and being confirmed), but that would threaten not just blockchain but all encrypted communications generally, so at that point really any online transaction would become open to attack vectors... but only from whomever holds the Quantum Atom Bomb.
Anyone please feel free to correct me here this is not my area of expertise but I've been trying to learn as much as possible in the past week.  I will update/edit anything I've gotten wrong.
EDIT:  Smarter people than me talking about quantum resistant cryptography: [

Hm.  Are you saying that lack of governance (or more specifically, the lack of a centralized power/monopolized violence) is an unnatural construct?  I would argue that government (or rather self-organization) is the primary form of unnatural construct.  Entropy is the natural order of things and anything in the opposite direction requires self-organization.   If you follow the argument I make above and agree, then this would mean that governance is inherently man-made.  If we have made something, why can we not change our creation?    And if the structures we have traditionally built to maintain power always inevitably topple or crack... is this the nature of power or is it simply a flaw in our design specifications for those structures?  We've been building centralized power structures (ziggurats if you will) for 10,000 years, maybe its time to start building honeycombs instead.

While much of the commentary is surrounding BAKKT, I can't help but wonder how much of the recent price fluctuations are in response to the news regarding developments in quantum computing, and FUD surrounding how that may potentially affect rhe security of bitcoin in future.  I've seen some fairly reasonable breakdowns of why quantum shouldn't theoretically pose a threat to blockchain security... but the breakdowns are highly technical even at a surface/overview level (ie. Discussions of Shor's and Grover's algorithms).  I don't know how widespread this information is, and many people I've spoken with who have a similar level of surface/overview understanding of bitcoin have responded with a knee jerk reaction of "Oh shit I guess google's gonna mine all the coins now!"  All of this is to say... I would love to see some more attention paid to the topic of quantum attack vectors vs SHA256 and private key encryption.  More discussion of these concepts in layman's terms would be valuable as an educational resource imo.  Maybe we can lobby 3brown1blue to tackle the topic?

Totally valid.  Corporations have already been threatening the power of nation states in the latter half of the 20th century and this could continue.  However the only private entity I can think of with resources to compete with the US military budget would be... Google... who is currently employed by the US military.  I'm sure a different private competitor could enter the field but I think it will be decades before we see that, and I don't know that any company could ever outstrip the US military's resources to fund research.

So given what is stated on the wiki.... ie. that it would take a quantum computer ".*..128\^3 basic quantum operations to be able to break a Bitcoin key using Shor's Algorithm.*" ...does that mean it would only take 128\^3 operations to crack SHA256?
Is cracking SHA256 an additional step beyond the required 128\^3 operations to break a private key?  ie. The computer would need to execute a decryption using both Shor's Algorithm on the key AND Grover's Algorithm on SHA256.

Access to sufficiently powerful quantum computers is and will continue to be extremely limited due to the physical logistical problems required to run them.  Quantum computers aren't just a new graphics card upgrade.  They are run in hypercooled laboratories.   Functionlly this means only high end government funded research labs will have access.
