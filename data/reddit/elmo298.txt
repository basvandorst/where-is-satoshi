Bitcoins version is just the hard fork
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:15:53
I know, which is why I only follow bitcoin but don't invest in it as I see it has no purpose aside from a trade pair unfortunately

Santander are known for it, which is why I use my Nationwide, but now can't use that have to go through Revolut as the people who provide Nationwide's SEPA refuse to deal in bitcoin related stuff. FML

Aha that gives me confidence to use it!

this guys probably the best at it:  he's also currently getting legal proceedings against him by bitfinex instead of releasing information, which is quite telling.

China is the greatest 'capitalist' success story the world has ever seen, with hundreds of millions brought out of poverty and into the middle class in a short period of time and it's incredibly socialist.

No I quit my job and invested my life savings in one asset and there will be no ramifications I'm sure of it

It's a good feeding when all your alts gain on the btc ratio and hold their value. Lovely

It's basically btcs only function atm.

I mean, any crypto that works as a currency is competition for bitcoin, and most of them do a better job apart from value of the coin.

A reduction in extreme poverty from 81% of the population in the 80s to 6% in 2012?

Wait until tether collapses. Then you buy

Have a look at as well in that case. They've been quite involved in Venezuela and supplying food etc!
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:21:50
They might have made a transaction cheap by then 
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:38:15
Tethers gonna fuck btc up soon. Firstly because it's printed like 200mil in a month.. Course it can back that up. And secondly because it's masquerading in the crypto space as a usd equivalent and the USA will soon not appreciate that.

It's why Libya and Iraq were destroyed because they were threatening the petrodollar

Aye a lot of people forget this. Average people feel more comfortable with actual numbers of coins rather than decimals
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:08:08
Well seen as 6 people managed to affect billions of dollars of money exchange by s2x and then cancel it through choice, I don't think BTC is exactly that much less decentralised.

"my random internet fwend invested 100's of thousands in btc, and doesn't care if it does well or not. You should all be fine and please upvote"

That'd be a good thing because that means the French don't exist
