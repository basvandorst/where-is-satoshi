If people only used places where bitcoin deposits went to offline wallets and the hot wallet was thus never bloated this number would at least fall by a factor of 2.

What I don't understand is why any place would have a user send BTC payments to their live wallet. That means they are risking an unknown about of BTC every day. At  we have users send payments directly to the offline wallet. That way it is easy to insure the live wallet and limit the exposure.
The protocols for dealing with any process though should be very clear and I wouldn't trust any site who has been in operation for a long time that had a bloated live wallet stolen as has happened so many times in Bitcoin history.

Signing up is free. We have changed the text to make sure there are no ambiguities. However trading is also free as long as you are making a limit order which goes on the orderbook before being traded.

This is sad

 offers bulk trading but after receipt allow the user to choose when to execute the transfer. The user is given the current rate and can accept or deny the transfer. If the user fails to accept the price the user is sent back his or her payment minus a small processing fee.

 is a great site with Polish banking if you are looking to take advantage of this offer by T-Mobile.

I'm not sure why people don't understand this. Fiat is centralized. Perhaps there will be a decentralized exchange between crypto and crypto but that's it.

This is crazy. It's obviously the thief’s fault but I can't imagine opening a business like this and not being able to take a 30btc hit. Also where was the cold wallet?
The idea that a wallet which needs to auto process withdraws can ever be secure is something that needs to be removed from people's minds.

Does anyone have a list of all the BTCs being publicly sold. I think there is another silk road auction that will happen. Does anyone know when and for how much?
Once these are done, there's going to be a greater confidence in the price I would think.

I'm Gebbit's Marketing Director. I've notified the users involved.
In behalf of Gebbit I apologize.

Gebbit.com has hired indepedent marketers. The marketer which made that post has been let go and new guidelines for marketers from now on specify what they can and cannot do. This is something that is not allowed. We are sorry for the issue.
