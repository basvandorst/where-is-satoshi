Sure, why not!

I don't see why this matters, whether it's software on your computer, or an online wallet in the cloud. The fee goes to the miners, and depending on your software client, or your cloud wallet, you may or may not have the option to set your own transaction fee.

There's two points.
1. As I said above, the reward halves every 4 or so years, once i reaches 0, miners will have to rely off the transaction fees.
2. Fees help your transaction to get processed as a priority, so that it get's confirmed by the network faster.
It may seem like a good bit of cash, but it's split between tens of thousands of miners all competing. And most may not ever mine the full 25 BTC reward.

Agreed, Absolutely no need to panic.
Also a PSA:
Make sure you always take backups of your wallet!

When you really break it down, mining isn't profitable for the most part anymore. Depending on how much you are transacting, you should at least include a very minimal fee.
Yes, miners do get the 25 BTC for mining a block, but for some miners, mining a block can take months or more. If it's pooled mining, then the payouts are more regular, but the value over time is the same. Transaction fees help keep the network healthy, and also help your transaction be processed faster.

I agree, It should no be advertised as "fee free", as clearly, there are transaction fees, should you want a timely transaction to take place.
Most banks from here (Australia) do not have any transaction fees for bank transfers at all. (However, there are account keeping fees, etc) So this would obviously be a better option for domestic transfers.
International transactions are where things get difficult however, as transaction fees are fairly high.
The place where Bitcoin excels is at a POS location, where a vendor is processing a lot of transactions every day. The banks do charge exorbitant fees on this service, and for this purpose, Bitcoin can be a cheaper alternative.
Another place I see it being very useful is where a large sum of money must be instantly and non-reversibly processed, such as buying a car.
This provides the seller with quick confirmation that the funds are available, and the seller does not have to carry a large amount of money around with them. Fees are useful here too, wherein the transaction should be processed and confirmed as quickly as possible to prevent waiting.

The reward for mining a "block" is 25 BTC. All miners compete to solve blocks, so that only the miner that confirms, and provides proof that he "solved" the block will get this reward. This is troublesome, as the amount of miners and the extreme competition means that a miner that is mining alone may only get a reward of this amount every month or year, or perhaps would never be able to mine one.
Pooled mining is where hundreds of miners work together to solve the blocks, and they then share the reward. This provides micro-payouts to each miner depending on their share of the work, once the whole pool completes a block.
For example, let's say there are 1,000 miners in a pool, and the pool solves a block. That would net each miner 0.025 BTC.
Obviously the mechanics of this are a lot more complicated as some miners are more powerful than others, but in simple terms, this is how it works.

You determine the fee. As I said, it depends on your wallet.
[BlockChain]( lets me specify a zero fee, however it will make transactions take significantly longer to confirm.
See: 
Fees should stay steady about the same, the transaction volume will scale up and provide the necessary fees for the network to operate.
@_date: 2013-11-25 07:21:27
The fee is added to the reward fee for solving a block. There are feed to provide an incentive for miners/pools to prioritize certain transactions over others. There is a ever-reducing reward, that halves ever ~4 years. once this reaches 0, the miners will have to rely on transaction fees for running costs.
Refer to my below answer regarding the dynamics of how miners are paid per block.
@_date: 2013-11-25 09:47:20
Either way you look at it the same outcome is clear: miners don't work for free.

I would suggest you try reading some of the information available online in regards to most of the questions I can see you are asking.
There is a list of questions and answers available [here](
I believe it would answer most of the simple questions you seem to be asking in this thread.
You could also put your question into Google and see what types of answers you get for it, as most of it is available with much more detailed answers elsewhere.

I never said it was a charity. I'm simply saying that while it currently may be profitable for them, it will reduce in profitability, and then who's going to pay for your transactions? Even ASIC miners are running I very minimal profit. We will eventually be forced to change our mentality to this, why not start early?
@_date: 2013-11-25 07:26:47


So it's [Reward] + [TX Fees] = Total Reward/Block

You could put them up in @_date: 2013-11-14 08:20:53
I like the second version!
When and where can I order them?

The fee goes to the Bitcoin network for processing. It is an incentive for miners (Who process transactions) to process yours faster.
You don't _have_ to pay it, though some services, such as the one you are using, impose it. (So that your transaction doesn't take forever to process)
If you are using a client like Bitcoin-Qt, then I believe there is an option to not include any fee. I use BlockChain, and they have the option to send without any fees. (However, as I said, it can take a long time to be confirmed)

Looks great! Maybe you could do a square one too?
