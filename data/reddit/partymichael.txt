I have 0.03 BTC. I spend an inordinate part of my day thinking of what could have been. *sigh*

No problem. I'm sure you might have tried all of this, but i would spend my time changing around capitals, swapping for  and $'s, and inserting spaces where you might have thought to. If you go through the process of creating it again maybe you can follow your steps so to say.

You know, I've always found 99 to be a much more appealing number.

I see.

Were you following [this]( website? You said it might not have been a youtube video.

First off congrats! You made a risky choice and it paid off. As for what to do now, I say just enjoy yourself! Don't worry about trying to advertise to it everyone. If you just enjoy the success you have people will notice. Classy is always the way to go in my opinion!

Yup. Those percentages are definitely higher in reality.

If you're located in Canada [QuickBT]( works wonderfully! You can only purchase 0.03 BTC per day but it's extremely simple, and they give a friendly phone call to make sure everything went well!

Well I guess it depends on what you consider *rich*. You'll likely have more money than you would have had without owning BTC as long as you play it smart and **safe**.
