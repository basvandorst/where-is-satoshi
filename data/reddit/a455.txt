Banks love noobs like you; this is all part of their game and they make a lot of money this way.  But abandoning your bank account is a bad idea.  You fucked up by giving someone access to your account via echecks without covering the possible charges.  Now don't be a pussy; pay the fees, learn from this, and move on.  Bitcoin is not a solution or an excuse in this case.

Plexiglass security panels, banking from home, or just being polite are how to solve this problem.
But if you really want to, you can use bitcoin to solve any problem,  for example of running out of toilet paper.  Just wipe your ass with that paper wallet.

WTF is wrong with you ?  NEVER PAY EXTORTIONISTS!  You are enabling them to continue and victimize others.
If you want to pay for something useful, give the idiot IT guy a scholarship for a basic computer management skills class.

This is not really open source since much of the js is minimized, but it does run offline, and although you could wade through the thousands of lines of js to verify that it's completely safe you don't have to; if it's used properly it can be safe regardless.
For public keys, no worries.  For private keys, save the page and run it offline using a computer that never touches the internet.

They sent my order just fine; it's beautiful.  But it's true that they don't ship as fast as Amazon.  And the $5 shipping doesn't get you a tracking number.
Anyway, Zen is not a scam.  Plus right now balls and cubes are on sale at  use discount code "NeoPriceWar".

A bitcoin can be copied.  But posting it results in a double-spend, which the blockchain technology will detect and reject.  As a result, bitcoins cannot be successfully copied like other digital objects can.

The Zen sets really are nice; get 'em while you can.
But this is why we can't have nice things; if adults would be less ignorant/neglectful of the dangers of these magnets then the nanny state wouldn't have to take it away.

Bitcoin is great for control freaks 'cause they can still control it after gifting it.  But then that's not really a gift, is it?
If you want to be able to revoke a bitcoin "gift", simply put an expiration date on it.

The blockchain (bitcoin-qt database) is 30GB.  Armor derives it's own database, another 32GB, from that (it doesn't download the blockchain directly).  So to use Armory [online] you need both databases.

A spam-fighting bot sounds innocent enough, but keep an eye on it or it'll steal your bitcoins go buy random drugs on the darkmarkets.

What's with all the advice to pay the extortionist?  If you managed to let your stuff get cryptofucked then you lost your stuff, dude; get over it, learn from it, don't let it happen again.  Or next time you'll be whining about losing all your bitcoin to some malware you installed.

CHIP is a $2,000,000 gamble right now.  They will be locking down the production numbers in mid-July.  If we're lucky we'll see the first chips in December.  The technical docs should be available at about the same time.
So if you want something as powerful as a RasPi today, get a RasPi, don't wait for CHIP.

It's quite possible to build one that shows 3 bitcoin exchange prices plus gold with $12 worth of parts from eBay and a few dozen lines of code.  It does require a proxy to make the Arduino talk SSL to the exchanges, but that's pretty easy too.  Building a nice case for it is actually the hardest part.
