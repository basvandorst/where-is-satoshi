Hello there! Storj's most recent blog [post]( actually tackles this very idea.
@_date: 2014-09-03 20:01:38
Companies like Overstock are not doing that, much less have even heard or considered Viacoin in general. Viacoin is too new and too much of a risk to try.
@_date: 2014-12-03 02:38:01
And plus these 750 bitcoins are only the coins that Syscoin got in their IPO, I believe.

What makes you not hyped about Storj?!
@_date: 2014-09-06 05:15:35
Very good point. In the end, media plastering us as stuff that you mentioned along with other misconceptions will be on of our biggest struggles. Once potential solutions such as something like blacklisting are implemented, it'll show that Storj is not and has never been a cloud storage service that caters to criminals.  
  
As stated above and in my edit, I do not want people to think I was implying that Storj was made for illegal content. Our team has thought of potential ideas to deter people from using Storj for illegal content.

Adoption. A lot of people who haven't looked into Bitcoin think that it's a scam or a waste of time and money. And on top of that, a lot of people just aren't willing to figure out how Bitcoin works.

I wasn't really making a point about Ethereum being or not being something special, but more about Bitcoiners.
@_date: 2014-06-24 04:45:31
I guess I meant it as as a general contrast to the argument that you were presenting as opposed to actually countering your points.  
  
That being said, an appcoin can still very well be valuable if the app it represents is valuable. The more popular Storj becomes, the network will have an increasing demand for storage and bandwidth with a limited amount of Storjcoin to support it. Of course, Storjcoin's value is directly related to the success of the Storj network as a whole so it will be basic supply and demand in the end. In this case, storage/bandwidth is the demand while Storjcoin is the supply. Regardless of how much storage/bandwidth is devoted to the network, there will always only be that set number of Storjcoin available.  
  
You're right that Storjcoin is not backed by storage and bandwidth in the traditional sense of the word, but the value is still strongly relatable.

Anybody can modify the Bitcoin code. It's up to the users to come to a consensus on choosing which version/fork/etc is the 'right' one or one to set on.
@_date: 2014-08-27 22:56:34
Well because that's just a little piece of the Storj. Why market ourselves as just a Dropbox alternative when we can market ourselves as so much more? Our service will support a service like that, yet offer so many potential services at the same time too.

Hi there,  
  
So, there are some flaws in your argument. Primarily when you said this:


   
Anyways, many appcoins go beyond what is currently possible with Bitcoin. Storj, for example, uses the blockchain to store metadata which the Bitcoin blockchain cannot do. *It is literally impossible for Storj to work on the Bitcoin blockchain.* It's not like we (Storj) wanted to create our own coin, it's because we *had* to. At that, we plan on integrating back into Bitcoin if sidechains and/or treechains come to fruition.  
  
Another problem with your argument is that you imply that people shouldn't be getting money for their work. Some of our team members work full time on Storj, as well as having many part time volunteers and freelancers helping out. We have also have marketing costs, costs of travelling across the country, and so on that have to be paid for. Without some sort of money source, it would be impossible for Storj to even think about turning into a complete project. People can't spend everyday working on something without and expect to make a living. All of those other costs aren't free either, and we will have many costs to come during development and progression.  
  
Also, nobody is forcing others to buy our coin (SJCX) and other project coins too. It's solely up to the person buying them. They can see the team, software, and information we put forward and decide for themselves whether we are a worthy project.
  
Apologies if I came off rude, I didn't intend to. Cheers!
@_date: 2014-08-07 19:03:02
Okay, stuff like this really irks me. I can understand a dose of skepticism, but when the majority of are on some high horse that Bitcoin is high and mighty, it is 100% a circle jerk.  
  
Not all altcoins are scams. Ethereum *especially* is not a scam. They have one of the most able developer teams of any decentralization/Bitcoin 2.0/etc projects out there and have been working for an extremely long time on it. While I myself only subscribe to Ethereum's subreddit and nothing more, Bitcoiners really need to get off of their high horse and actually start realizing that the possibility of coins coming along that are MUCH better than Bitcoin aren't "scams". And at that, plenty of coins exist today that are huge improvements on Bitcoin.  
  
I understand that Bitcoin has the most ecosystem built up around it and that Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, but Bitcoin's community is becoming increasingly pretentious about the coin.

PoSV is a new form of POS which creates an incentive for actually using the coin. Normal POS is based on just holding coins while PoSV is based on holding the coins *and* their use (i.e. their velocity).

@_date: 2014-09-06 04:37:15
Hello! Matt from Storj here about the example you gave.  
  
The problem with your example for Storj is that there isn't a way for LE to know where any illicit file is being held. If a user gets their computer confiscated and it's found they're storing illegal content on Storj, no node can be held liable because LE won't be able to figure out what node is helping store it. Even if they were able to, the file being held by a node is encrypted *and* just a small piece of the whole file so there is way for even the node operator to see what the file they're storing is. Much the same way if a node operator has their computer confiscated by LE as well. They can't get in any legal trouble because LE wouldn't be able to figure out what is actually being stored on the hard drive.  
  
Edit: I am **not** implying that Storj is made for illicit content - our team has thought up a few solutions on how avoid illegal content like cp. My point was that a node operator would not be held liable if someone were to store something questionable on Storj.

@_date: 2014-10-10 16:21:56
Not really. Both Storj and Ethereum and any other crypto project with a competent legal side has made extremely clear that their tokens (Ether, SJCX, etc.) do not represent shares in their respective projects or teams. That is, have explicitly stated that their tokens do not represent any kind of security and that contributing to their crowdsales does not give you any kind of ownership in anything besides the token itself.

There were some people that questioned the release of funds for project milestones, but I personally love the project. I too invested a bit in it.

Yes! We already have a pretty basic decentralized video player built on top of the Storj platform using the Metadisk API.

Lol, 99% of open source projects make you 'trust' that it's the same code. As for their deposit addresses, they're all up on the website.  Hit "details" after each coin and you'll get their addresses.
@_date: 2014-11-17 23:36:32
Without Bitcoin, Counterparty and XCP would die. That being, I would own both Bitcoin and Counterparty, if anything. Think of Counterparty as a layer on top of Bitcoin.
  
And the currency unit for the ethereum platform is called 'ether'. It acts as a fuel for the platform.
@_date: 2014-08-27 16:37:55
No, the blockchain is a store of metadata. This metadata acts as 'pointers' to where files are being held on the network. This allows us to cut back on blockchain bloat while still having it hold vital information. 
@_date: 2014-06-24 14:07:08
I'll clear up a few concerns and questions:  
  
* **Your data can vanish instantly.** Your data is stored at a redundancy that you set. If one host goes down for whatever reason, there will be multiple copies of your data still available on the network.  
* **The host can access your data.** Your files are encrypted before they are stored with the host. Therefore, the person storing your data cannot access, view, or steal it.
* **What if someone is storing illicit content over the network?** That is answered [here]( by the lead developer.  
* **Why not just use Bitcoin instead?** On the front end software, you can choose from a number of options such as Bitcoin, Storjcoin, Peercoin, USD, etc.  
* **What problem(s) does this solve?** Storj is a completely decentralized, alternative cloud storage network. Storj ends up being cheaper, more secure, and trustless when compared to traditional cloud storage companies such as Dropbox and Apple iCloud.
@_date: 2014-09-01 21:22:45
Not necessarily saying use Storj right now more as just what one important use of Storj is. [node1.metadisk.org](

@_date: 2014-10-17 20:17:29
@_date: 2014-08-27 14:41:31
On another note: MaidSafe and Storj are the similar projects in the sense that we are trying solve to solve the same thing but in a different way.
@_date: 2014-09-10 22:28:20
You've made some very good points!  
  
I think that there is, for the most part, always some sort of incentive to decentralize a service. For one reason or another, it can't hurt to do so. In Storj's case, even if data is encrypted, decentralization offers a few advantages:
 
1) Nodes will constantly try to offer the cheapest storage. This 'competition' of sorts helps provide the cheapest price possible for people trying to store data - far cheaper than current providers.
  
2) Because both storage space *and* bandwidth are resources on the Storj network, the decentralized nature can still be just as efficient as a centralized host.  
  
3) I'll be using Megaupload as my example here. So, **all** of the data stored on Megaupload, encrypted or not, was deleted. Just being encrypted doesn't solve the problem of a centralized host being forced to delete what's being stored or if their systems are confiscated.  
  
4) As for Sybil attacks, this is addressed pretty well in the whitepaper - see link posted by In the end, there may be autonomous agents running the nodes that would prevent malicious owners from shutting their nodes off at once as well.

Storjcoin X (SJCX) is a Counterparty token, so therefore still operates on the Bitcoin blockchain.

Hey there kerstn,
  
We initially were going to use Bitcoin, but currently that isn't possible with its blockchain. You see, we need the blockchain to store metadata ('pointers' to where data is held on the network), and as of right now Bitcoin cannot carry that much information. Because of that, we created our own coin - Storjcoin X (SJCX). Should sidechains or treechains be implemented on top of Bitcoin, we will gladly reintegrate.  
  
In reality, we really use multiple blockchains, including Bitcoin's.
@_date: 2015-01-20 03:43:02
I don't know if I'd go that far. Was used by a fair amount of coins at one point or another, but has now been phased out for the most part now that Dark Gravity Wave, DigiShield, etc have been brought about.
