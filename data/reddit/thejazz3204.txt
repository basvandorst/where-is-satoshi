Well, a bit late for that now man
@_date: 2017-03-10 05:50:01
Ok sorry is what your saying that your wallet stopped working a few hours ago? If so this gives me hope that it's an issue with everyone and not just me and it'll be fixed
@_date: 2016-06-25 00:02:24
Fuckkkk yeah bitcoin's gonna skyrocket
@_date: 2016-06-25 00:18:49
Woah... This, the UK, China... Prices are gonna boom. I can see them going up by the second right now.
@_date: 2016-06-24 22:59:46
Source? How'd you come to this conclusion? This sounds pretty weird to me.
@_date: 2016-12-14 15:37:58
I really can't access my old Coinbase; Authy really hates me and refuses to work. Will look into that other site, sucks there's no instant buy but if limits are that loose waiting a few days is worth it. Hope Circle starts selling Bitcoin again, though. This is a pain in the ass
@_date: 2016-12-15 02:05:42
Nope, all these sites require too much info and/or rip you off. Circle and Coinbase didn't do that and now they're out of the picture so I'm pretty screwed...
@_date: 2016-12-14 17:57:30
In the US, blockchain's just a Bitcoin wallet and pretty much nothing else
@_date: 2016-12-14 17:55:59
From what I've read, these days mining is a waste of time and money. Plus I'm just not smart enough for all that lol
@_date: 2016-12-20 21:39:43
No go. No phone service and it won't let me just use an app. Such a pain
@_date: 2016-11-06 02:53:06
That's a no go, I don't have phone service currently so I can't get a verification code.
@_date: 2016-11-06 01:28:51
If you don't mind me asking, which ones do instant buy? Thanks
@_date: 2016-12-15 01:59:19
Hm, well I just signed up for GoCelery but it keeps saying my bank info is incorrect (which is bullshit).... Think this is a no go
@_date: 2016-12-14 17:59:15
It's mad expensive? Don't make enough money to do that, if the lowest I can buy is in the $100s range
@_date: 2016-12-20 21:46:31
Well, I've been trying for weeks to get back into my Coinbase. Just contacted them again today, hopefully I can explain the situation and sign into my account again. Happy holidays to you as well
@_date: 2016-12-20 21:42:35
Gemini looked great but it won't let me sign up because I don't have phone service and can't get a code, even with a texting app
@_date: 2016-12-20 21:44:39
Uphold is just not letting me sign up (says I'm providing bad info and locked my account all because I don't have phone service), guess that can be amended if I explain the situation but idk.
GoCelery said my bank account wasn't legit, even though it WAS, and I had proof. Plus the site seemed really glitchy
@_date: 2016-12-21 09:40:16
Yeah mind your own damn business, don't go telling everyone mine. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 21:57:33
@_date: 2016-12-20 21:57:15
They rip ya off
@_date: 2016-12-14 15:40:24
I would move as far away as possible right now tbh. To like Europe or some shit
@_date: 2016-12-15 04:20:50
Wait man... I don't want to shell out $1000 for a miner when I'm a total noob... I've tried looking into mining in the past and whenever I read into it, it's like I'm reading in a different language
@_date: 2016-12-20 21:49:47
@_date: 2016-12-21 15:24:02
Get a life, asshole
@_date: 2016-12-20 20:00:01
Been trying hard for the past few weeks... I reached out today and they said the process would take a few days. Hopefully I cn get back in but idk
@_date: 2016-12-20 23:31:20
Being picky? What? It won't let me make an account because all I have is a texting app and it says I need legitimate phone service which is something I can't afford right now. Gemini seemed like the best option but it's a no go.
@_date: 2016-12-20 21:49:30
I cannot unless I sign up for another bank account (which is possible I guess? Idk)
@_date: 2016-12-20 21:41:14
However, they're either glitchy, require so much info that it's impossible to buy, or just plain rip you off. Been trying for days, but I really think just getting ripped off is my best bet in terms of buying.
@_date: 2016-12-20 23:50:45
It really is....
@_date: 2016-05-10 23:30:37
Days you mean?
@_date: 2016-05-11 03:49:36
It came through thanks
