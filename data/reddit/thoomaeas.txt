You're both correct.  There's two different types of inflation:  
price inflation  
monetary inflation

The largest uses of Bitcoin are all relatively recession-proof markets:
Gambling -&gt; lottery ticket sales increased during the 2008 depression.
Drugs -&gt; If people start losing their jobs, more people will turn to using/dealing drugs, DNM, and Bitcoin.
Cybercrime, tax evasion, capital controls evasion -&gt; This activity will also increase in a recession.
Bitcoin is one of the lowest-risk asset classes if you're a criminal who's worried about asset seizures.  Nobody has ever had their Bitcoins seized if they were secured properly.

There's no such thing as inherent value.


Bitcoin is one of the most valuable assets from the perspective of people who need global, censorship-resistant transfer and storage of value.
Its' properties are indisputably valuable to the drug and cybercrime markets.  Those markets generate a combined $1.8T+ annual revenue, and Bitcoin adoption within them has been growing non-stop.

Gold also had 80% crashes in its' history.  
So far, Bitcoin has been a great store-of-value if you dollar-cost-averaged and held for a minimum 3 years.

Its' fundamental utility is still thriving: [

Block reward halvings will reduce the sell pressure from miners (currently up to 54k BTC per month dumped by miners).
Wallstreet/media will inevitably start another hype/pump campaign and Joe Public will pile in again.  There's a huge incentive to pump it again.  8x if if goes back to previous high.
Coinbase only had 20m accounts at the peak and Binance 5m.  As kids graduate from high school, to college, to generating income, there's a never-ending supply of gamblers.  Each generation becomes more tech proficient too.

Holy shit, Danny Brewster is back.  I held some of his shitcoin scam on Bitfunder back in the day.  
2018 is the new 2014 confirmed.  
I thought he was in hiding after he stole 9800 BTC.  Why expose himself with this new venture if he already made a fortune from his Neo-Bee scam?

Too bad the ETP is only 48% BTC and 52% scams.

Read up on the Cantillon Effect.  Inflation is not evenly distributed.  CPI doesn't account for the higher price inflation of stuff rich people buy: stocks, mansions, supercars, high-end prostitutes.

Adoption of Bitcoin in the drug and cybercrime markets didn't suddenly stop when the price hit $1k.
According to the UN's 2018 World Drug Report, the % of global drug users who source from DNM has been growing every year.  From 4.7% in 2014 up to 9.3% in 2018.
The largest DNM, Dream, doesn't even accept XMR.  The volume is still dominated by BTC.  XMR is used as a mixer by a small subset of users who care about chain analysis.
According to a Bromium research report published in March 2018:


























The 2017 monkeys didn't care about the 2013 monkeys who got burned buying a parabolic chart.  The next round of monkeys in 2021 won't care that it crashed in the past either.
The crypto casino is here to stay.  There's a never-ending supply of new gamblers as teens become adults and start generating income.  It's wallstreet's wet dream because anyone with a smartphone and cash can buy in.  They don't even need ID if they buy in the peer 2 peer market.

Sorry for *your* loss if you've been bagholding traditional assets for years and missed out on crypto.
