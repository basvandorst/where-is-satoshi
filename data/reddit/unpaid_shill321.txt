Yep, also you like shitcoiner Charlie Lee, because said so. You are welcome.

This is not what an attack is.
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:12:43
Isn't that a bad thing? Which numbers do matter?
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:11:09
Hahhaha!

There was an effort to bring back the community together called Segwit2x but it was heavily FUDed on this subreddit and elsewhere. It ended up being called off. There's an easy way to bring back the community together: solve scalability issues even if it means pushing a "quick fix" like a 2MB block size increase until longer term solutions are found.

And so... what use case does bcash serve better?
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:29:56
Below 10K$, lucky you.

In a few years when Bitcoin is approaching moon, you can proudly tell your son you spent a whole Bitcoin to bring him into this world.

In an alternate universe, price goes up and is filled with self-congratulatory  posts.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:23:23
What attack and how do I protect myself?
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:53:32
Can we stop calling everything an "attack"?
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:42:29
And that's why  was such a dumb idea. Good luck getting miners to activate your upgrades now.

Think he was too busy spreading ~~FUD~~ advice on reddit to get his coins off "evil Coinbase".
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:30:40
Sorry, I didn't mean to make you so emotional.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:35:09
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:59:29
What's "this"?
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:19:46
This is good news™

If some of the most important Bitcoin users (e.g. BitPay, Coinbase, ShapeShift, BTCChina, etc.) and almost all miners can't change Bitcoin, who can? A couple of [these dudes](

He forgot to say 'sorry' once.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:02:50
Thanks buddy ;) Don't forget to let us know when you buy back in.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:32:03


I respectfully [disagree]( and do believe it's more or less a zero sum game. If Bitcoin Cash really serves a use case better than Bitcoin, than which use case does Bitcoin serve better?
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:41:02
Now I have to trust half the people.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:08:59
If you can't find the word for it, you call it an attack?
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:42:21
Bitcoin != Reddit
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:03:52
The  FUD in recent weeks here was just beyond ridiculous. I tried my best to bring back some rational discussion here and there but it was hopeless really. I wish there was a bitcoin sub that was a bit more neutral and transparent (isn't it unfortunately).
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:36:36
What can we do to defend Bitcoin? Maybe we can also spam their network?
