Knowledge is great, don't get me wrong, but how would one know where to draw the line on what should be considered common knowledge? Should memory management, ADTs, time complexity, and discrete mathematics be considered general education too? I wouldn't mind but I bet a whole lot of other people would.

1. Vendor receives bitcoin.
2. Customer receives goods.
If the vendor does not want to hodl, I suppose they would either need to use a crypto-to-fiat type payment processor or manually exchange their BTC into fiat on a timely basis.

If you choose to be your own payment processor, yes. Just don't allow your QR code to be tampered with (: There may be solutions for tamper-proof QR codes out there already. If I had to do this myself, I would have the QR code shown on a small display near the register and only give trusted employees access to the video source.

You're asking the wrong guy. I primarily use my cellphone for phone calls, SMS, and 2FA. If it wasn't for the aforementioned necessities, I would go full Richard Stallman and not use a cellphone at all.

Whenever I'm in a sketchy area or on vacation and need to use a credit card, I always just top off an empty crypto card from my phone with the amount I need as to avoid having my actual credit card's info stolen by a clerk or one of those face plate devices that swipe your card data. I can't be the only one who actually use cryptos as currency.

In the case of Bitconnect, the nonexistent enterprise is the alleged trading bot that is responsible for the daily interest returns. Some people refer to the affiliate links as proof of Bitconnect being a Ponzi, but that isn't necessarily what makes Bitconnect a Ponzi. If in fact the trading bot does not exist (I do not believe that it does), where do you think the daily interest returns come from? New investors. If Bitconnect truly wasn't a Ponzi scheme, they could clear all doubts by proving the existence of this trading bot and also proving that this bot does what they claim. As of today, there's been no proof. Furthermore, if this trading bot does exist, why does it not leave any footprint?
My big issue with Bitconnect investors is their approach to investing; they look for reasons to convince themselves that an investment is sound. That's the definition of stupid money.

Oh yeah, let's choose a phone based on emoticon compatibility.
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:39:36
If you don't think a *project* or technology is sound, after having researched it, why would you invest in it? You're only proving my point. 
When someone puts forth valid reasons for why Bitconnect is most likely a Ponzi, you're instantly defending the dumb thing. You're so sold on the promise that you refuse to as little as humor the idea of the promise being illicit in nature.
EDIT: PS: Proving that Bitconnect is a Ponzi without access to their backend is about as possible as proving that a God doesn't exist. Being unable to prove that something is false doesn't mean that it is true. Prove that unicorns do not exist. 3, 2, 1, go.

I would actually be somewhat careful when telling people to do their own research. One YouTube rabbit hole later and all of a sudden he's investing in Bitconnect.

I think he's implying that you pay tax on the mined coins when you sell them. I cannot believe the IRS would actually try to tax you once for mining the coin and then also for selling them. I just cannot believe that to be the truth. That would be far too fucked, even for the IRS.

Aside for known VPN connections, were there any other major red flags you would look out for? At first, I could have sworn the VPN wasn't connected but now I'm not sure.

I have two first names and use them interchangeably so this could be why but I'm unable to confirm which I had used because I can't sign in to VirWoX. I decided to give wesellcrypto my business instead. Thank you for answering all my questions :)

I'm located in the US and the address on file for my PayPal account is as well. If I registered on VirWoX using another first name than what is on my PayPal, could that raise any flags?

Yes, it's 100% verified.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:48:36
You weren't wrong, in theory. If someone encodes a secp256k1 ECDSA Bitcoin private key using nothing but a pen, paper, and some quick mafs, nothing directly ties their identity to the address of said private key. In practice, a Bitcoin address is only as anonymous as its transactions. In using centralized exchanges (with KYC), you forfeit this component of anonymity that you otherwise would theoretically have.

Is there a risk? Yes. Is the risk high? Depends. I've kept larger amounts for longer periods of time in software wallets. How secure it will be is largely based on what security precautions you take. I would say that you'll most likely be fine but don't take my word for it.
