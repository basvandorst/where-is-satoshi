@_date: 2017-08-12 15:39:13
Buy from Coinbase then send it to an application like bread wallet. 
Do not keep your bitcoin in coinbase just buy from there. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 05:12:50

Its a lot different when you have bitcoin in the name especially for newbs 
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:59:17
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:51:22
Also im using coinbase is that the cheapest safest place to buy. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:55:55
I know very little about bitcoin. But isnt the housing market incredibly different then bitcoin. Bitcoin has no government ties correct?
@_date: 2017-07-03 13:42:16
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:54:46
is there generally a good hour to buy or does it just fluctuate randomly 
@_date: 2017-07-11 05:05:14
The reason i made this post was to see where peoples heads were at and what their thought process was/ information they could give me that backs that idea so i could formulate my own opinion on a handful of responses.... idk how thats retarded LOL
@_date: 2017-07-17 20:20:16
!RemindMe 3 years
@_date: 2017-07-11 03:22:21

@_date: 2017-07-31 14:15:29
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:48:54
Im a newb normie should i buy now or wait
@_date: 2017-07-11 05:03:21
Not really. Id rather have advice from people who've been in bitcoin longer than me and seen how the price has risen and dipped over time in correlation to different factors... Then just buy some bitcoin when i feel like it. 
@_date: 2017-07-11 03:50:32
Sorry im a newb to all this. Is there any chance that bitcoin could go up after the date. 
Like it seems like allot of ppl are predicting it will fall. 
im jus tryna get a feel as to what the general consensus is so i don't lose or gain alone. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 07:03:30
Should i transfer from coinbase to something like breadwallet for the ios?
@_date: 2017-07-12 08:35:22
Thank u!
@_date: 2017-07-03 13:36:09
Will bitcoin price spike after this happens?
@_date: 2017-07-12 08:34:56
Thanks! Sorry if its a dumb question 
@_date: 2017-07-18 08:23:03
So is breadwallet no more safe then coinbase?
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:10:06
