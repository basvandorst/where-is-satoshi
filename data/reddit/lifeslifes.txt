Bonus bagging is one of the few instances you gain an edge over "the house" in online casinos.
If they're running a 1 for 1 new player bonus up to say $500, you deposit $500, they match it, you now have $1000. You can't withdraw that $1000 that would be too easy so you have to "turn it over" a number of times by playing in the casino before it becomes withdrawable.
Find the game with the lowest house edge (blackjack) and you follow a simple chart for optimal strategy which tells you what to do in every hand situation. This is done with very small bets to reduce variance, normally 50c or $1 per hand. This can be about around .5% house edge depending on the specific blackjack rules.
Say you have to play your deposit through 30x before you can withdraw, that's 30 x $500 = $15,000. $15,000 x .5% house edge = $75 loss so on average after the run through you would have a $1000 - $75 balance of $925. This varies due to how lucky you are, typically for this example ending up with $600 to $1300 or so as your final balance, it can be more or less if you're extremely lucky/unlucky. 
Withdraw and rinse and repeat at all online casinos that have similar offers. I made about $10,000 doing it over a couple months when I was 18 but got in relatively late. The casinos cottoned on and now you have to wager say 200x your deposit or blackjack doesn't count, only slots which have a 10% house edge so it becomes useless to do it. If you got in years earlier than I did the casinos had no idea and you could make hundreds of thousands easily: 5x deposit wager requirements, monthly $1000 bonuses at 10 different casinos etc.
But it's mostly useless now so reading this has been a waste of time :)

1. Invest a third of your wealth in bitcoin (an extra $34k), properly store it.
2. Invest a third of your wealth in low cost Vanguard trackers spread out over the world economy (as a hedge if bitcoin fails and the economic worldview held by most people here turns out to be wrong - over the last century equities have yielded on average 5.9% per year).
3. Keep a third in liquid cash for stuff you want/need.
4. Finish your degree, think about what job you want to do, go to job fairs, get on a grad scheme for a couple of years that rotates you around a lot, they're fun.
5. Spend less time on the internet and stop fapping so much.
