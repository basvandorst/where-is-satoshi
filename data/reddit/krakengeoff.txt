Hi anonymustanonymust,
Kraken Client Engagement here,
Just wanted to clarify that Kraken is using segwit almost since it had been active. At Kraken every address is stored in bech32 format, however the addresses are not yet presented in that form in the frontend.

Any questions about this please direct them here:
