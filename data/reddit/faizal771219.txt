To solve this millenial question , lets ask Bram Cohen himself . 
To Bram Cohen :- 
         " Are you the one , known as Satoshi Nakamoto ; the inventor of Bitcoin ? "

There must be a rational explaination behind this latest price crash . We need a group of multi billionaires to buy bitcoins to raised its price . Mayday ! Mayday ! Mayday !

Bitcoin's price will rise again after this Chinese New Year . In the meantime . HODL on .

Thanks for the answer : ) .

If other altcoin is not dead , Bitcoin is not dead . Bitcoin does not reveiving any attention because of the scallability problem . When Bitcoin became slow and expensive , media stops to promote Bitcoin . It seems that Lightning Network has come too late to rescue Bitcoin now . The price dip will continue , until Lightning Network is working properly and adopted by mass bisneses . And it will take time , from there for investors to put their money in Bitcoin . In a few month maybe , the price of Bitcoin will rise again . For now , brace for impact .

Is this news true ? Or its just a Warren Buffet's speculation campaign against Bitcoin ? I really don't believe that this article is 100% honest .

Please dont make this type of shitpost here . It is not funny . Serious . Or I'll contact the moderators to make sure that this kind of statements shall not be published here in this sub-Reddit .

I think Bitcoin will only replace fiat money . Bitcoin will never and cannot replace precious metals like gold and silver . Bitcoin also will never replace precious stones like diamond , pearls , etc . This is because it is stated in the Qur'an , the Holy muslim book , that diamonds , pearls , gold , silver and etc. is a measurement of wealth in this temporary world but the real wealth is the wealth in the world of the hereafter , which is forever . The Qur'an has never made any mistake in the past , now , in the future and forever .

This article is stupid . The Trump administration have appointed a pro-crypto dude as an SEC Commissioner last week . Plus Commissioner Hester Peirce is super bullish on crypto . It is said that Chairman Jay Clayton is also leaning towards approving crypto . One last dude is not a crypto fan . And also the SEC rejected other bitcoin ETF application because they didn't provide insurance to protect the customers . But this is not the issue for the CBOE-Van Eck-Solid X ETF application , for that they provide insurance for their customers .

One of those 9 Bitcoin ETFs will be approved this 26 Oct or 5 Nov . And again , the more important Van Eck-SolidX-C'boe Bitcoin ETF will be approved on 27th Feb - early March 2019 . Its hard to deny a Bitcoin ETF approval with 3 of the 4 SEC's Commisionners in favour of a Bitcoin ETF .

Some anti-Bitcoin group paid him a large sum of money to make that embarressing and exgerrated speech about Bitcoin . Undeniable .

Regretfully I have to agree.
I have seen far too much outright dishonest and extremely incompetent behaviour from Samourai to ever trust it myself.
Samourai has very poor privacy while bragging about having good privacy: It sends your addresses all back to their server. Their "trusted node" mode doesn't change this, it just exposes your Bitcoin node to attacks completely needlessly. (Needlessly because they only use it to relay transactions, which they could do via the public P2P ports of any node, and because since they've already sent your addresses back to their server sending your transactions via something else doesn't increase your privacy.)
If you want strong privacy then as a start you need to run a full node  (and use either Bitcoin Core wallet, or run your own electrum server), preferably via tor.
I don't doubt that they want and intend to eventually have good privacy but it seems that they're just unable to stop lying about it, even after previously being caught.

Don't use problematic wallets anymore . Samourai Wallets have lots of 'lost bitcoin' issue . The wallet provider have just stole your bitcoins . Instead , use Luno Wallet , which have a 100% trusted reputation among crypto wallet users .

I think you have made a wrong explaination regarding the btc in the channel .

He is indirectly stating that the Malaysian Goverment WILL BE EMBRACING Cryptocurrencies . And that alone is hugely important .
@_date: 2019-01-10 14:47:45
I'm a malay , I am sure that he is urging Malaysians to be ready for the age of cryptocurrencies and blockchain  .  Meaning that he will allow cryotocurrecies and related companies to enter Malaysia without difficulty . This is the first local company that develops crypto wallet/exchange/cryptocurrecy Alipay in Malaysia . They've got the authority's co-operation .
