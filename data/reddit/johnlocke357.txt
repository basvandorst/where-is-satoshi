Not sure if that's a joke. I'm just going to take it as a kind but impractical gesture.

Excluding Bitinstant. I already know of those highway robbers.

I used to be able to deal with it. It let me be for the most part and let me move my rutting money. But their absolutely ridiculous AML policies are driving me insane. You have to provide not just your name and address, but a social security number and a fracking digital copy of a photo ID just to move the damned money where it needs to go. They have forgotten the very people which made them great, and chose to be paypal. Their pointless company deserves to go bankrupt.

The nearest chase bank is 84 miles away. There comes a point when the transaction is small enough that the fees from Bitinstant are less than the gas to drive there.

[Anti Money-Laundering]( For example, the requirement of a valid ID and social security number to ensure they know who you are and that you aren't a criminal. What it comes down to is a massive pain in the ass for us.

i've always imagined the first week of a potential release there to be a massive boost, followed inexorably by a tumultuous plumet. it'd be a great way to double or to triple your bitcoin stash if you traded prudently. and in the long run, it, along with bitcoin would stabilize. so, for the good of my wallet.dat, i hope they make the irrational decision on this one
