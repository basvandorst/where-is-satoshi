I am curious what will happen around the UASF. I think the price spikes before and takes a hit after depending how well it goes. We may surpass 6k in the next 6 months.

Can you 1031 exchange your Bitcoin into Real Estate?

$3K is great but I cant wait for $10,000. That will be a great milestone for Bitcoin

He said that he sold all his stocks, not everything he owns. Nothing wrong with it as long as you understand what you are investing in and how to secure it. Stocks are crazy high right now, at least Bitcoin's market cap is small relative to its potential. You invest in stocks for "high growth potential" not safety (historically bonds or gold are safety ). You can make 10% in a day with Bitcoin, it is worth the risk.

I will wait until I can buy the plane with my Bitcoin

Because we are going to the moon! I would be cautious going into the UASF, not sure how this will play out or how the market will react but either way I will always own Bitcoin. If the price crashes substantially then buy more don't sell.

I am just curious what the community thinks, Bitcoin is at $3,000 and climbing.  I am sure many newcomers don't know they can buy smaller denominations of Bitcoin or they are intimidated by the price. I am not saying whether its a good idea or not I am just wondering what your opinions are. Maybe it can be optional on exchanges for users to price it in Bits (or whatever other denominations) or Bitcoins.
