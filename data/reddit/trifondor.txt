For &gt;90% percent holding is the better strategy. if you trade you have to pay fees and you mostly don't sell at ath or buy at a dip. so you performance is lower vs just do nothing. you can outperform the market at a higher risk. look for Prof. Martin Weber (German) he have done a study about the markets and how to manage you risk and rewards.

Yeah and he is right, it is crippeld when more then 40% of all coins can't move any more or very very slow with rising fees. 
The Solution is to build up on a crippeld system to enforce an untested 3th party software to help with a problem created to push LN.
