Wow, that was an asinine (but creative) way of linking 11 documents.... I don't have time to go into all 11...
But here's a few that don't support your position.
"Right wing account suspension". Anti-right bias.
Conservatives not safe to express their opinions "because of the company’s ultra-liberal work environment."
When an ultra-left outlet like Huffington post says something like "Jack doesn't know what he wants" means Jack might actually be waking up to the fact that he's biased and is not comfortable with it. From a leftist view point, if you are not all in, you are the enemy. If I was Jack I would be torn too... commit political suicide by disagreeing with the leftist lynch mob, or have some kind of integrity and treat people equally.... He has a lot to lose.
"Admits left leaning bias". What part of that do you not follow? Or is it a right-wing act, to admit you are left leaning? :) Poe's law in action most likely.

The value is in the Tx he linked. The value dropped into here yields a date 32 years into the past.
Interested to know how this actually works (or is supposed to work).

Leftists are pretty good at holding mutually incompatible ideas (and at the same time keeping a straight face), so being happy about the support by twatter is in line with that kind of mentality.
@_date: 2019-03-19 06:48:17
I think the journalistic standard is whether the article has words or not. Whether they form sentences and contain meaning that makes any sense and conveys any accuracy is purely optional.
@_date: 2019-03-21 08:41:31
You're the one linking 11 articles in some autistic manner and expecting readers to go over them all and see things with the same bias as you. Jack is only perceived as right leaning by leftists. To everyone else, it's just becoming apparent that he might have a conscience (but I don't yet believe it myself; actions speak a lot louder than words).

Exchanges don't want a clear winner; they want a million shit coins that are constantly traded back and forth so they can take a cut of each trade. Once a wad of funds are on LN, and if (big if) BTC is the only crypto... the exchanges don't get anything.
@_date: 2019-02-26 15:25:44
Well, good work. I'm not keeping tabs on the code, but would hope that those kinds of behaviors are covered by unit tests.
@_date: 2019-02-13 14:26:13
I hadn't seen that article, but it marries pretty well to what I have been saying to people for quite some time. The biggest problem is that mainstream media has become a joke and they pass stories around between them and no one checks whether the stories are bullshit or not, even when the fact checking would be a trivial process to carry out. I have to assume they simply don't give a fuck. If the story fits the approved narrative and generates clicks, it's all good.
@_date: 2019-02-14 08:06:07
Not even close.

My recommendation is to do some independent research on the matter and come up with your own conclusion. People here (and elsewhere too) will just tell you what to think.

What do you mean without the need of a second application? I have been playing around with BlueWallet for a few days and have sent, received and done everything I would think you should be able to do, with just that wallet. (Custodial issues aside).

Don't put too much into BlueWallet. They have some creases to iron out.
@_date: 2019-02-08 13:28:18
Yes, I think you are right. I take that back.
@_date: 2019-02-04 01:07:29


That doesn't make sense because "unused" block space is not a thing. Only the data in a block is written to the block chain. It's not like a bunch of 0's are written up to the maximum block size.


I suggest you go back and look at how this stuff works, because you clearly don't understand it right now. Not trying to be mean or anything, but what you are saying is nonsense. BCH's first block is the same as BTCs, from back in 2009. BCH's block chain is about 70GB smaller than BTC's at this point. That's simply a function of how little transactions are being put through BCH vs BTC.
@_date: 2019-02-12 13:01:49
Probably the low Tx fee.
@_date: 2019-02-18 01:36:40
What if your heirs forget how to derive the key, or to aid themselves they write it down somewhere?
@_date: 2019-02-21 12:33:19
No, it will probably take a lot longer in future. Took me a about 45 mins to get funds into BlueWallet.
*Longer for same fees I mean... (obviously you can pay more to speed it up).
@_date: 2019-02-03 16:35:58
I thought you may have had actual empirical data to back up your claim of "folly". So what you have said is just empty rhetoric as opposed to any real science.
@_date: 2019-02-04 02:31:10
No worries mate. Cheers.
@_date: 2019-02-08 10:30:00
No. Cost of the *whole operation* not just the LN fee.
Minimum of 300 sats for a BCH Tx? This isn't BTC my man!!
@_date: 2019-02-14 03:28:30
I would suggest using low amounts as this wallet can lose funds.
@_date: 2019-02-04 04:50:25
lightning-roulette.com was the one I was using. It seems like a good, honest site.
I was less interested in the site, though, than I was in testing the wallet deposits and withdrawals (and I guess the site's LN implementation), but the game on the site itself was a nice amusement. I used it for an hour in total I guess. If I trusted the LN more (I assume the problem was on BlueWallet's side), I might have played a bit more. I'll try the other wallet that you suggest.
@_date: 2019-02-09 00:01:43
Haha. lol. I'll keep than in mind for future. ;)

You said the *"folly of big blocks*". Just in case it's not obvious, the idea of big blocks is not exclusive to BCH. So the price of BCH or usage of BCH doesn't demonstrate this supposed folly. The rest of your reply is off the rails somewhat, so I am not going to address it. Cheers.

Firstly, thanks for answering. My account may be new, but I am not new. Furthermore, even though I participate in other forums (such as I am not here to troll or shill. I have been playing with LN lately and I am interested in learning more. The more people I talk to, the more I can learn. It's as simple as that.
So if I am reading your response correctly, the "folly" that you speak of is not technical in the sense that it has not been proven out as yet, but you feel that with such large blocks its a threat to decentralization? If so, this is a sentiment I hear often from this subreddit.
Can you do me a favor? Can you read that Satoshi quote again? It's actually a quote I am well familiar with (I have it saved on my computer, along with a number of others) because the way I read it, Satoshi is actually saying that centralization (to a certain extent) *was always part of the plan*.
"The current system where every user is a network node is **not the intended configuration for large scale**."
In reference to the future... *"Those few nodes will be big server farms. The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate."*
Do you see the same thing?
Given that, I am having a hard time understanding why the narrative that everyone has to be able to run a full node (even on a raspberry Pi) has originated from? It seems like an extreme design requirement?
Sure, Satoshi is not infallible I am sure, but you used his quote to support your case, so I thought I would try to show you how I think it does the exact opposite.
Maybe you have further comments on that?
On your comments about centralization vs decentralization. Obviously I can appreciate a certain level of decentralization, else what's the point in Nakamoto consensus? Also I am acutely aware of the fact that central points of failure (e.g., if all nodes where in a handful of data centers) are a bad thing.
That said, I think there are varying levels of centralization and it may be (yet to be proven) that there's a tradeoff in terms of scalability and centralization.  For example, I think that for LN to truly scale it's going to have to progress past the point where people have to run their own LN nodes (and maybe watch towers also in future). In my mind there are zero mass adoption scenarios where everyone would be running an LN node. So then, for mass adoption, many users would share one node (like is the case for BlueWallet) and of course, that system is more centralized and also comes with other downsides like custodial issues.
I am of the opinion that there is no perfect crypto out there, and am starting to lean towards the idea that incumbent network effect may win out in the end, but it really has to have zero barriers for adoption at scale. The one issue I have with BTC right now, well the two issues, are how will on-chain fees play out in future (bearing in mind they are the on and off ramps for LN) and also how will LN become so user friendly that my parents could use it? In terms of those two pain points, I think some other cryptos may have better offerings at the current time, but then they currently have negligible network effect, and therefore no compelling reason for people to adopt them. I don't think anything is certain at this point though.
Anyway, I appreciate the conversation. I also understand that you probably have a watch out for trolls and other shit stirrers, so no worries about the initial back and forth. It's all good. :)

@_date: 2019-02-07 08:44:51
Well, I'm not so sure why people here are upset about it, because you obviously can see right through it, with that 5 mins of research. Roger ain't fooling you. ;)
@_date: 2019-02-14 03:31:05
With high on-chain fees that are planned to get higher, and the requirement to run your own computer hardware or use somewhat expensive phones that can handle LN sized QR codes, the BTC eco-system is not really a world currency, but a first-world currency.
@_date: 2019-02-04 04:10:55
Thanks for the reply.
I did notice that the send Tx that I was talking about that failed (and worked after subsequent re-tries), did actually get withdrawn from my balance, so the subsequent re-try was a double debit. Double the amount never made it to the roulette site, but double was debited from my wallet. So that makes some kind of sense as a bug in the wallet.
However, subsequent testing with additional transactions is making even less sense. Somehow, the starting balance, less 3200 sats (in 3 send transactions) resulted in a wallet balance now almost 8x higher than before (but still less than what it should be overall). There's definitely some significant issues to be sorted.
One thing that has me slightly miffed is that there is nothing on the Google Play store to say that the Blue Wallet is beta. Lucky for me I never trust anything without testing it, but it seems like a liability at this point when it's not advertised with any warnings.
I will take a look at that extension that you suggest and do a bit of reading about it. I'll see how many sats that I can recover from the BlueWallet and try to transfer then over. I'll write off my lost sats to experience. :)
@_date: 2019-02-07 13:33:48
