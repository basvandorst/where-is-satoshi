What do you do when you don't have any Bitcoins in your wallet?

Mining with your laptop will probably not be profitable. Also laptops don't handle heat as well as desktops, shortening the lifespan of your GPU and possibly your battery.

It's very easy, let me explain:
1. Solve the riddle
2. Go to [Brainwallet]( and enter the answer of the riddle into the passphrase, followed by the 'salt', which in this case is " reddit riddle 2" (this is done to prevent bots getting all the coins) [example](
3. You can sweep this wallet using the private key. Warning: don't just add this private key to your wallet as this private key is now considered unsecure ([check out this thread](
I'm not 100% sure (don't own any BTC to test this out) but you should be able to use  to create a transaction.
Good luck!

I'm not sure, but what can he do with BTC in prison?

This depends on where you live of course. Banking fees are really low for me (about 2 euro a month). I've never had to pay for transfer fees even on international transfers. Payment from a few banks show directly (the major banks work together for this if I'm not mistaken). 
Don't forget that you also often have to pay to convert bitcoin to fiat (correct me if I'm mistaken here). Even if it's as low as 0.5% that's about 5 euro to convert 1000 euro of Bitcoin. While for 2 euro I get a debit card, bank account, savings account and a credit card. Some banks even have lower fees. Oh and everywhere I am in Europe (and a few other big countries like USA, Turkey, Russia,... ) I can get money from an ATM, no fees. And I'm protected from fraude.

There is no real reason now. (for me at least)
