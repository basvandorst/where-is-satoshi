Well they won't now because the bankers are interested in it. It would have been easy a few years ago when only 5000 forum guys knew about it, but now over 2m users which are also: big commercial guys, vendors, multinational companies, and banks. It's not that easy anymore.

the authors put their own song on the blockchain, why would they file a claim against themselves?

Perhaps, but the topic itself is important. Miners won't mine if the electricity costs alot.

And what are those symptoms really... transparency? Trustful banking? Sound money?

Why can't bitcoin run like a corporation?
Each holder would vote by a % of his holdings. So the lost bitcoins are obviously out of vote, and the rest of active bitcoin users would vote based on how much % of bitcoin they own.
It would be much more fairer. Yes there are very wealthy guys who own 1m BTC, but it would be still fairer than it is now!

This technical vodoo is one of the most hyped scams out there.
