That's my point: they **are** immediately converting their BTC to cash. They do not hold BTC at any point of the transaction.

Not sure what you mean, can you expound?

No business wants to hold any kind of currency that fluctuates so much in a single day.

IMO that is a pretty shitty metric for "security" and "safety". 
You can place a credit freeze for free if you are concerned about people opening up credit accounts in your name. That seems like a much better solution than using Bitcoin all the time if that's what you are worried about.

But nobody is saying "cash is the safest and most secure way to buy things". I generally don't carry cash around and put everything on my credit card, because I have far more security and protection that way, both for my personal belongings and for my purchases.

Not going to happen anytime soon, both Newegg and Dell immediately convert their Bitcoin to USD. Neither of them want to actually hold Bitcoin.

You're talking about two different but related concepts that share the same term. 
Monetary inflation = increase in the money supply
Price inflation = decrease in purchasing value of a given unit of currency
You can have price inflation without monetary inflation, and monetary inflation without price inflation. Price inflation is a function of both the supply *and* demand for a currency.

blockchain.info keeps giving me an "Unexpected end of file from server" message. Pretty sure that is a server-side error. Will try that later. Bitcoin-qt is taking forever to sync.

I looked it up and it's not an uncommon error.

I don't see any import option in the Bitcoin client. I did just copy/paste a copy of the wallet.dat into my %appdata% Bitcoin folder. Will that do the trick?

Guess what, just because somebody doesn't have a "right" to something mean it's OK to act certain ways and say certain things. 
What's hilarious is how much *more* of a shitstorm gets stirred up when someone is called out on their racist humor. Because somebody telling you that your joke is shitty is so much worse than making racist jokes.

I don't think it's very much but it's still kind of exciting to see. If I remember right I never got a full coin. But hell if it's like $50 worth I'll be happy.

I have made a couple encrypted backups and put them in different places.

Are you a Nigerian prince? I only trust Nigerian princes with my online dealings.
