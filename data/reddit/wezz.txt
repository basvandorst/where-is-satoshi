Soooo bitcoin isn't resistant to attacks? Wasn't that a selling point like 4 years ago?? Oh wait so was low fees! Is this even still bitcoin at this point... 
@_date: 2017-08-19 06:32:20
Right yes okay, but everyone was just going crazy at BitPay because they tried to get everyone to use bip1? Or something? 
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:54:23
I thought this sub wasn't allowing these posts?
@_date: 2017-08-26 10:35:06
Do you only care about value? 
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:56:22
With these fees BTC doesn't have any real world uses...
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:41:24
Every post that breaks the rules I did, yes. It's weird it's still here isn't it? If I posted about BCC it would get deleted
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:33:46
Does BTC not have anything like that? What about if more and more miners leave because it's less and less profitable to mine on BTC? 
@_date: 2017-08-11 11:40:58
Just curious; what part of the hf has reinforced your support for not upping blocksize? 
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:50:11
Can someone explain something to me because I haven't been around long, but didn't core and everyone all agree to the 2x as a compromise? Because like last month everyone was saying how great Segwit2x is and now everyone is calling it malware?? So confused! 
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:24:49
That has nothing to do with if I believe segwit is good or bad, I was just challenging you to back your words up by proving this sub doesn't remove certain posts, ultimately proving that it is in fact this sub that cannot handle criticism, but I'm guessing this comment will be deleted soon
@_date: 2017-08-27 07:10:06
Actually because of the EDA there is no point ever that BCH won't be more profitable to mine, because the difficulty will ALWAYS drop to a point it is better to mine it, even if the value is 0.00000001 BTC, so trying to kill it is rather futile. However BTC can get to a point it is never more profitable, because it doesn't have the ability to adjust downwards dynamically. It's actually really interesting to watch from an unbiased standpoint. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:53:01
The entirety r/btc are OK with killing bitcoin because of one post made by one person. Ok.
@_date: 2017-08-28 08:09:09
Could always just use cash ��
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:08:50
What about the loss in hash power on BTC chain, what happens if say 30% of the hash power moves to BCH because it's more profitable? Doesn't that mean there will be even less blocks to main the rising number of transactions, at the same time BTC blocks will take longer to be adjusted down in difficulty.
Im just trying to paint a full picture 
@_date: 2017-08-04 16:49:34
I'm struggling to keep up with the rules of this subreddit, and I guess I've made a fool of myself because of it.
@_date: 2017-08-27 07:27:01
I don't think anyone can predict what will happen if that ever occurs, and it will take a long time. 
Think of BTC and BCH like fighters in a ring, everytime BTC gets hash power back from BCH before the EDA, it is like BTC is winning the round. However because of the EDA BCH will always start a new round within around 12 hours and it starts all over again. However if just once BTC does not receive the hash power back, then BCH wins the round. However BTC can't recover like BCH and won't be able to get the hash power back without some external interference (big price pump or HF to also have EDA) like I said it's so interesting to watch from an unbiased standpoint ��

You're right, SegWit is perfect in every way and if you don't think so then you're stupid or purposely mocking us.
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:04:34
Actually SegWit transactions are generally larger as they require to point to the witness data
@_date: 2017-08-28 10:10:22
I'm one of the few that don't look at the price as the definitive scale of measure, I'm excited to see cryptocurrency take over the world, I'm just not as excited about what BTC is looking like, and the 2nd layer puts a huge dampener on the technological achievement
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:27:33
I have no criticisms for SegWit... I think you've missed the point of my comment, it's of no real importance anyway

Ask them to support other coins and use that instead, bam no more fees. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 08:16:46
Well the core devs are actually suggesting to use PayPal so I guess if no one uses bitcoin for transfers and only store of value then the blocks won't be full. I'd just keep using cash

Just buy into a pool. Like bitcoin.com or antpool

@_date: 2017-08-01 17:48:04
No problem :)
@_date: 2017-08-02 09:59:21
So, in your eyes, bitcoin is whatever core says it is basically, it's starting to sound like a cult
@_date: 2017-08-04 11:56:49
Make a post here criticizing segwit, I dare ya. Then we'll see who is shutting themselves off.
@_date: 2017-08-28 09:17:59
No it isn't, and that's why there was a hard fork because a lot of people feel the exact same way

Like 99% of the backlog are non-segwit so that makes no sense to assume they are using the boost. They simply didn't want to include transactions
@_date: 2017-08-27 06:57:31
So yeah enjoy losing your money for a couple of months 
@_date: 2017-08-16 10:07:41
Just out of curiosity what about a company owned satellite network is not centralised? If you ask me that is a piece(s) of hardware that everyone will use all being owned and maintained by one company...
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:21:49
If the mempool is representing the users, what could possibly be more pressing? If a P2P currency system doesn't focus users what is the ultimate point of that said system? 
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:37:33
Segwit increases total space usable by tx by around 30%, however segwit tx are also around 10-15% larger due to requiring to point to the witness data.
So yeah it increases the space a little... but I don't think it will really do much for a long time.

Actually I'd say the best incentive is it cannot be censored or controlled and you don't have to trust a company or entity to use it. The fast and cheap transaction issue just because the scaling issue got out of hand. Just use a different coin until the issue is resolved, as soon as all this started I transferred all my funds out of bitcoin, the moment you don't trust the outcome is the moment you should probably not use it, but I'm in it for the long run, I can't wait to see bitcoin take over the world, it might not be the bitcoin we have but I do believe cryptocurrency is the future
@_date: 2017-08-28 08:48:48
Or just don't blindly follow core
@_date: 2017-08-27 15:29:50
You should probably read up on the technology behind bitcoin, it is not your standard currency. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:44:12
You were wrong. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:47:44
What does that have anything to do with what you or I said?
@_date: 2017-08-04 16:08:07
Except for the shitposts ofc

Doesn't Roger live off BTC? How would he be able to drop BTC and use BCH? That would be like you living in America and only using €

Did you think segwit was going to change anything? I feel bad for anyone still holding btc at this point... 
@_date: 2017-08-28 10:08:00
Yeah, except there's like zero chance it will ever go to $0
@_date: 2017-08-27 07:31:19
So 2nd layer can't be attacked at all? Also how does the increase make it cheaper to attack? 
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:29:57

Was there a competition for smartest people in the world that I missed? 
Last I checked core was just whoever blockstream say it is, since they are paying the bills. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 05:17:03
Mad because you can't get those posts deleted? 
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:26:10
LOL I think that comment just made my day 
@_date: 2017-09-01 05:06:16
So they are basically going to be sat there stroking each other's egos, since there is no one from the "other side" so no kind of debate at all? 
@_date: 2017-09-03 06:21:25
I think he was trying to make a point that bigger blocks don't require all the effort, and produce the same effect. But I guess that wouldn't have had the same effect to include? right?
@_date: 2017-09-01 05:11:31
Yeah but they can just print another $10trillion, what's the point trying to compare with something that can just move the bar higher at will
@_date: 2017-09-01 05:44:53
Lol the name of the conference is breaking bitcoin, I would have thought that's all they talk about
