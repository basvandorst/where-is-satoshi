Technically Satoshi released a pre-release of the white paper in August 2008 that lacked the word Bitcoin in the title or abstract; the abstract remains but the full paper is considered lost

At first it was truely P2P, every user running a full node &amp; miner. Now it is a decentralized system; but this was always part of Satoshi's plan and therefore Bitcoin's plan.
Satoshi envisioned large datacenters hosting nodes/miners in the future so that Bitcoin could work with the large volume of transactions.

instead of linking to Satoshi's posts only on btc talk why not link to all his writings?

Indeed, not only that but it has been happening for years.
What started as one client has become multiple things, wallet, miners, node, all use different software and I expect to see this compartmentalization continue

OP thinks that Satoshi means to the 1MB block size *limit* to be perpetual and that he had to trick us simpletons into doing it.

Although only tangentially related to bitcoin, I'll say it again.
Bitcoin is worth it's weight in entertainment.

I dare say I've seen a subreddit designed for just such a think
for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies at it looks like it's the lone mod trying to power it up but it's got some fun content so far.
Thogh based on the Blythe Masters thing in WSJ the other say where they said 2023 would be first tiome govs collected taxes via blockchain I expect *another* halving before full bank adoption

I see things differently. The white paper originally showed Bitcoin as Satoshi intended it, soem more vocal developers no longer (or never) believe in the ideas in the whitepaper and they want to make their own altcoin based on Bitcoin but not Bitcoin.
Telling newbies to read the whitepaper hasn't been a reflection of Bitcoin for a while, so  maybe these people don't want others to see the ideas they don't waqnt to develop

Since you are already running a farm I am sure you know this but by modulating the light/temperature you can trick the plants, doing this one can achieve photoperiodism (flowering, molting, migration, antler growth, etc) multiple times a year. It's been a while but I remember that more 'even' divisions of the natural setting work best, e.g. flower the plants every 6 months but not every 5 or 7
You don't have to wait as long for harvest with science!

I used to tell people to read the whitepaper when they asked about btc, I still like to tell them to do so but I have to tell them the system in place is much different than the one envisioned in the whitepaper.
SHoudl we change the content of the whitepaper? I don't think that is a good idea at all.
SHould we make a new whitepaper and pretend that is the original, I also think that is a very bad idea (and I would no longer trust those who put forward that idea)
Should we make a Bitcoin1.0 paper to reflect the change in attitude of direction by the Core client contributers? Perhaps but it should never be confused with the original intentions of the Whitepaper, which show Bitcoin how it should be, not how it is.
