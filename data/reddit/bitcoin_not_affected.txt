Not wise.

The most simple is **the number of digits** needed to represent a number.  Take, say, the number 1024.  
log_2 would be the # of binary digits (sometimes+1); hence 1024 is 10000000000 = 2^10, 11 digits in binary.   
log_10 the # of decimal digits; 
log_16 the # of hexadecimal, etc...

I didn't say he said it.  I said it.
I agree with the whole objective; my concern is timing.  We're less than a year to a reward halving leading to BTC inflation of 4%/annum; this will soon start to manifest in additional buzz in the press (things like "70% of *all bitcoin* have been mined, etc), and the next bubble will put huge strain on the system.

That would be the case, say, of a stock split.  But hashpower will eventually determine a winner, and those on the losing side will see the value plummeting. 
**Hashpower is the key:** being overwhelmed with more hashpower on the other side may mean a 51% attack is now feasible.  
I wish it had turned up this way, but it has.  
So it begins:

Create a transaction for their (entire, normal) priv-keys, send it cryptographed, and unlock the passphrase in the will.  
Or automatically... have a bot do it for you.  You don't tweet for 6 months (or any similar activity), the passphrase is sent through numerous channels.   
The problem here:  being unable to recover if say, you are on a coma for 6 months.
