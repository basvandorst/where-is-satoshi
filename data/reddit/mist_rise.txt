I think people calling Trump hitler are very stupid since we as a nation have lost the meaning of many words, concentration camps, nazi, hitler

AA has said that you can do a BTC transaction with an old radio, clothesline, and working laptop, censoring that is impossible, add to that Ledgers or Trezors, and Paper wallets, and censoring people from holding or using BTC is near impossible
@_date: 2019-07-04 18:35:46
So you just pay the invoice right?
@_date: 2019-07-04 16:19:52
I think it has to do with LN being the second layer, and so the channel needs to get the Ok from the first onchain layer
@_date: 2019-07-04 18:27:42
Channels sound fun, but you can still pay manually anytime using ln, right?
@_date: 2019-07-04 16:03:04
But what are payment channels, why are people talking about fees and layer 1 authorization
@_date: 2019-07-04 16:21:22
thanks man, followed!

What is that ticker app with the cool neon aesthetic this guy and everyone else uses?
@_date: 2019-07-08 17:58:53
Bisq, Paxful, Hodl Hodl?
@_date: 2019-07-04 19:10:50
so why are BCH people always talking about how opening a payment channel will require many dollars in fees

We all have addictions, and we sometimes relapse, smoking, drinking, eating or and facebook’s addiction is selling your info to russian hackers!

Um, satoshi is estimated to have mined that much, rip

True, He was probably lying

Anything can be a currency, Crypto 101

Depends on the country and political climate

In a perfect world we would not have to care about FB meddling because Libra was an actual decentralized currency, but it isn’t, and secondly, Libra is going to spread everywhere, it will be on all Facebook properties including WhatsApp which has a big following in India and other developing countries, and will start to be accepted as payment for so many things, that people won’t know or will forget it is a FB property, this can be a good thing or a bad thing, it is good because Libra adoption will lead to Crypto adoption(if we are able to make Libra the gateway drug), or more people will use Libra and a divided community struggles to fight it
@_date: 2019-06-19 11:15:59
Yes but somehow shittier
@_date: 2019-06-19 01:06:54
Then in that case, we crush it, day after day we make popular posts and comments across the internet picking apart Libra, and getting major Crypto figures and traditional investors to give Libra the boot, point out Fb’s security flaws, and kill it. But this will also require “we”, We need to spread the word, and sure people may not flock to traditional Crypto, but we will sure as hell keep them out of Libra.

It will be healthy if we make it healthy, just letting libra stay there won’t do anything, we need Libra trading pairs with low fees, to make Libra the perfect gateway drug for actual Crypto.
@_date: 2019-06-19 16:08:36
@_date: 2019-06-19 11:08:27
Okay, well Although I dislike Libra, one good thing it can do is cull a lot of the Shitcoins in the market.
@_date: 2019-06-19 01:01:24
And yes I understand what you are saying, what is functionally better?, and we as the Crypto community through hard work and cooperation can make Crypto a better choice than it already is, and streamline it for the average consumer
@_date: 2019-06-19 00:59:31
Well using Libra for Venezuelans will be the same thing as using their national currency, they have risk of getting their account shut down(that is if they can even get Libra in the first place), and they don’t actually own it either, the only upside is low fee transactions, that LN Btc can already do.
@_date: 2019-06-19 10:49:24
Do you know how many companies FB owns, this will be on Whatsapp and  will be accepted in many places, and Libra isn’t catering to the actual Crypto market, Libra is catering to people who don’t understand Crypto.

Will the real Satoshi please stand up?
@_date: 2019-05-10 00:47:21
Yeah, you know when people have serious problems with the Binance hack, this is the best chance to joke!
