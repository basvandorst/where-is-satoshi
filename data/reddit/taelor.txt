I think this is a huge pump and dump, right before the futures come available. Pumping it up really hard and high, so they can short it in a few days.

I'm a host too, and as an early adopter who sold their BTC when it peaked around $25 I would love a chance to make some more.

when we mined our first ones, they were under $1

As an Airbnb host, who sold his 100 BTC he mined back in the day for $30, I would love a chance to get my hands on some more BTC without having to exchange USD for it.

Gimme that coin! 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:40:46
I got in during 2011, sold at 40 I think. My buddy and I had 100BTC each, we hit 4 times for 50 BTC each.
But hey, we doubled our investment on the mining rig we setup! 
@_date: 2016-09-28 06:46:24


Is that even a goal of bitcoin? I agree that those two things should happen, but I don't agree that's the job of bitcoin.

Also note:


Just nice to see a fairly large company doing something production with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:21:35
kinda got bitter about it, never re-entered like I should have. I really wanted bitcoin to change the world, now I just think its a bunch of people trying to get rich quick. but when I first got into bitcoin, very early on, I actually believed in it. I've always like alternative currencies (see the Ithica Hour), so I was drawn to bitcoin. But then it just became a money making scheme for so many people.
I've been putting my money into other investments (real-estate, equities).
@_date: 2018-11-07 22:53:45
Most of that is probably work-hours from developers. Probably a fairly large team with a big focus on it over the last year.
@_date: 2018-02-21 03:42:01
we sold them at $20 a piece
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:09:18
All you guys talking about "buying in" at a certain price... My buddy and I actually mined 200 coins, we didn't even have to pay for them. (well we bought and assembled a mining rig, but that was scrapped and used for gaming rig parts...)

"If I was the creator of bitcoin, I obviously wouldn't use my own name"
That's exactly why you would use your own name, to hide in plain sight!

"I have a friend who does wedding photography who's going to start accepting BTC, I'm starting up a non-GMO, organic, aeroponic food service along with reselling some miscellaneous organic and craft things that I can get a wholesale."
This is what we need to have happen to get Bitcoin to really work. Its not about mining, its not about currency exchange, its about real people trading goods and services easily and safely. 
Until we have "bitcoin commerce" the whole idea will amount to nothing. I think that the commerce carried out using bitcoins is the infrastructure.

Adam, I completely understand where you are coming from, if peoples passwords were compromised and such. I also understand the accelerating scaling situation you must be facing right now. But if you could take a moment and listen to our situation.
As for my friends and I, we tried to transfer in 50 BTC just about a week or 2 ago. They just never showed up in our web account after we have transferred. We have the address that we transferred in, and as far as we can tell, the funds are there. It's almost like our transfer address isn't properly associated with our web account.
If anything I would just take the coin back, so I could use it commissioning people for work, and spending it in various other economies. We just wanted to play it safe and sell back to equalize our initial investments in a mining rig. Otherwise I would have just bought some socks. $)
I know its only 50 BTC, but its more about the story I want to tell my friends. 
@_date: 2011-05-19 09:04:21
yah, this is the best one. its all in the font. it matches the main site.
@_date: 2011-05-19 09:40:53
look at the font for the bitcoin, then look at the font for reddit in rusty's logo. They both have that forward lean, future look to it.
@_date: 2011-06-19 21:09:36


I still kinda think its a big deal. Ya, the passwords were hashed and whatever, but I mean come on, look at the bigger picture. Normal people are going to see this and say, "fuck that, if they can get hacked im sticking to dollars"
Huge reputation hit, not just for Mt Gox, but for the hole Bitcoin community.
Now, this could be a huge reputation win, depending on how everything gets handled.

Upvote for you, I forgot to let people skip the first part of the week in review.
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:48:52


Honestly we did. We built our own machine using video card GPUs, learned how to max it out with the miners, bought a couple of stupid things online. fun times.
@_date: 2011-06-27 23:55:12
me and my buddies transferred 50 BTC to mtgox over 2 (maybe3) weeks ago. 
we have yet to see it show up in our account. We have emailed, I have talked to Adam on Reddit, but yet, they have just closed our ticket like everything is fine.
and we are still out our first 50 BTC that we mined. 
fuck mtgox.

i remember the first time it hit $40 and my friend and I went apeshit and sold all 400 of our coins!
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:49:28


I'm pretty sure we sold them to Mt Gox, so no.
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:23:51
absolutely not.

After recently coming across the "[All Weather Portfolio]( I've been wondering about how to fit Bitcoin into it. For me personally, I'd replace Gold with Bitcoin, and throw out the commodities and bump the Bitcoin percentage to 15%
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:46:01
Well, I agree, that the speculators do add fluidity to the BTC market, and that is probably fine all in itself.
But my problem is the reaction that people are having right now. The more that the loudly complain, the harder it will be to convince people that BTC is a good thing.
@_date: 2013-04-07 16:59:27
really letting your inner grouch fly on this one aren't you.
@_date: 2013-09-02 14:55:57
Actually yes. I believe when Minecraft was still in beta, people would purchase it for $10. 
A lot of people purchased it for $10. 
* edit: I was one of those people, with 3 of my friends as well.

Didn't he even try and start his own currency at one time, but was shut down by the US Government?
edit: 
So I don't think he was making them himself, but someone else was doing it on his behalf.

Horribly misleading title CNN is using to grab attention.
"There will be alternatives to the dollar, and this might be one of them," said former U.S. congressman Ron Paul. If people start using bitcoins en masse, "it'll go down in history as the destroyer of the dollar," Paul added. 
He is saying there will be alternatives, and if that alternative is bitcoin, then people in the future will look back and say, "bitcoin really helped kill off the old fiat system". There is no blame assertion in his quote.
I don't get the reason why people are hating on Ron Paul in this sub. He absolutely hates the Fed, the fiat money system, and has always been a proponent of alternative currencies.
@_date: 2013-12-04 22:57:56
Rand != Ron, not even close.
*edit: but I completely agree about Ron for President. I have donated and voted for him as much as I could have. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:04:15
This being said, I should probably put my money where my mouth is.
I'm a full time rails developer that works on hospice software, but I would love to get into some kind of open-source or paid project for BTC on the side.
So if anyone needs any help on anything, please message me and let me know what I can do to help.

Jerry Brito is great. I've had him on our radio show/podcast to discuss bitcoins a couple of times. Very knowledgeable and fact-driven.
@_date: 2013-09-02 15:27:14
actually no, when I first bought minecraft, there really wasn't any reviews, or any videos. that all came later, after it was out of beta. 
people just agreed with the philosophies behind the creator, and wanted to back him up with their money. 
so actually I think its very similar.

"And just who or what controls this automation, division, scheduling and distribution to ‘bitcoin miners’? Well, no one really knows. Except, of course, for that cloaked figure in the dark alley who goes by the pseudonym “Satoshi Nakamoto”."
The Math controls it. Bitcoins, backed by Math.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:59:10
hmmm, maybe people should actually try and use the currency to buy and sell goods...
@_date: 2013-06-06 16:55:59
We really should get him to have a guest come on and talk about fiat vs fixed monetary systems, the history of currency, and the reason we need bitcoin. I think he'd really get into that.
@_date: 2013-12-04 23:01:26
When it comes to the alternative currency party, I'm pretty sure he helped set it up.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:58:38
They actually stated that the recently hired a bunch more people to help with the validation queue.
