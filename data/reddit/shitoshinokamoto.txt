This is like an elaborate bitcoin-buyback program. 
...And just like stock-buybacks, someone else is paying.

I read the book. It is great, but i find it extremly focused on bitcoin as gold, and not much else (blockchain functionality).
His point on «a better store of value» is good (and plausible), but the idea of goverments coming together and making a better bitcoin is also hard to believe in when you see their troubles with effektive politics and trade.
The idea of bitcoin as batman is a good one though, but it wouldn’t kill it. Just prevent «the bitcoin standard».

If all governments did this at the same time it would be donezo. 
However, i think the US wont be afraid of bitcoin with the dollar at their command.  As we see with dollar, it is the go-to currency when things go haywire in smaller economies. This happens even if the dollar is not allowed. The local government is not able to handle this, and are slowly adapting. (Look at the eastern block, Zimbabwe etc)
Slowly but surely bitcoin eats away parts of this (in our day: Venezuela, Hongkong, Argentina.). Noen of the countries where this is happening is strong enough to prevent it. 
Maybe some day the dollar actually is under enough pressure for the US to outlaw bitcoin, but if this happens, it is a result of the powers behind it will be so weak that it cannot make the world unite against bitcoin.

Good question. «Where we are today» with the tech, distribution, stakeholders and valuation. Bitcoin is hard to define.
I am trying to find an example of similiar invention/tech that has ended up back in the bag. 
Companies(Myspace) are not very good examples. Commodities(tulips) neither.
Religions or ideologies maybe?
