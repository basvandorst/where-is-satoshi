at least you admit that that is complete speculation.

Yes. Putting all your savings in bitcoin is an awful idea.
Using bitcoin for savings is different to using it for spending. It's an investment like any other. And it's a very risky investment.
Yes the $5000 could turn to $10000, but it's not inconceivable that it turns to $0. If OP 'invests' in a USD savings account or a diverse portfolio of stocks, it's very unlikely that he'll double his money in a year but also borderline impossible that his savings are wiped out overnight - which is a very real concern with bitcoin.

You can have a hoard of finite things and still have them be worthless. The domain name  is completely unique, it's very scarce, everyone knows there will only be one, ever.
That doesn't mean it has any special value.

That's completely unfounded speculation though. Surely you admit that it's perfectly plausible that your $5000 becomes $100 in a few months? That's much more likely with bitcoin than USD.
Now if that $5000 is just one part of a diverse portfolio, then great, it could equally got to $100,000.
But is that $5000 a large (&gt;50%) portion of your savings? 
Don't put all your eggs in one basket?

But because bitcoin is more volatile than USD, you face the risk of losing a large amount of your portfolio without buying anything.

Excellent point. Just because something is scarce doesn't mean it's valuable.
