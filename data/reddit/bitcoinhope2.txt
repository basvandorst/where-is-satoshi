Most employees have a debit account for salary and that's paid by the employer.
Even so, a standard account is dirt cheap and you need a card anyway to pay for daily stuff/groceries etc. Contactless cards work extremely fast, something that bitcoin is incapable of.

This paints quite a dishonest idea because it crops the same exponential in more pictures. This suggests that exponentials can move up (giving you hope), but it's redundant because it uses the next picture which contains the former timeframe.
The whole thing suggests you should not be that concerned of them because they have gone up, but doesnt  show what actually happens to the complete exponential... when it blows up into a thousand pieces like it did in 2011, 2013 etc.
Basically, it compares apples to oranges because it
1. hides timeframes
2. repeats charts
3. doesn't show how all the full parabolas ultimately crash
This is how exponentials actually act, full picture

It's funny how I lacked the time to research what's going to happen to my bitcoins when the fork hits and what i chose so my primary indicator was watching how his primary advocate is acting.
And I decided against Bcash back then.

I'm encouraging people not to go head first now because of greed. If they go in now, they'll sell it when it crashes anyway because they won't wait another 1 to 3 years to get their money back or they'll panic.
The price does get higher, but it also gets lower before it goes higher.
Yes and no, cause Bitcoin might fully crash oneday.
No because not buying at 10k and waiting to buy at 5 or 3k will get you double or triple the coins.
This is like the worst time to buy.

When did they ask this? Was it by email and you were given a timeframe or did they just halt your activity and only allowed withdrawals?
I'm more concerned with the whole tether thing, about delaying audits etc.
some people have previously written about the tether problem
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:26:09
No, it's just common sense, not everything is a bch conspiracy. BCH will probably be dead anyway when the inevitable bitcoin crash happens.
Look at this  . You think this is not pending a huge crash? You think NOT selling that is reasonable?
Don't get me wrong, i'm a huge Bitcoin fan, i did my bachelor's thesis on bitcoin, i think it has an enormous potential, but all in due time. 
I sold mine now and will be buying back when it's low.

the only fishy thing is the friend not telling him about btc again. maybe he dead or they drifted apart or something.
However, not knowing about the news and especially about financial news is nothing that unheard of. Might be to you or others but a lot of people are just not interested in news.

Kraken was laggy as hell. I tried to use is for my first time yesterday and 5 consecutive orders didn't pass through.
All around very laggy.

I sold @ 9k and started shorting after. This is just crazy. I've been in the dec 2013 bubble and (and all the ecosystem) was not as disconnected from reality as it is now.
No significant actual adoption since then, no technical breakthroughs yet, hard forks but somehow it's supposedly worth 10 times more and growing. 
Bitcoin made more sense back in 2013 than it does now considering it had 4 years to grow. The only thing that really grew is the exchange houses system but that doesn't really mean adoption. I just can't find a reason for this current price.
It's not that I don't think Bitcoin doesn't have future potential, i see it reach 50-100k, it's that currently it's way overpriced.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:49:03
Bitfinex allows for margin trading/borrowing.
Futures/options might be available but on very shady sites. 
Bitfinex is the 2nd largest bitcoin exchange though. There's some shadiness with it too sadly.

He made a lot of good points. As for hyperinflation, that's something most countries can and have dealt with it as long they remained somewhat functional. Hyperinflation is a sign of unstable govt/society, not the other way around.
Sending cash becomes easier and easier and probably in the long run SWIFT will be replaced/using blockchain technology so it will be as fast as bitcoin is now, if not much faster. Blockchain aside, Euro zone already has SEPA which allows you to transfer a large sum of money for literally cents, they just take 1-2 days to register at the moment.
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:29:26
Yes, it says it's corrupted and client crashes.

Depends when they're cleared, because they have 3 frames for clearing: 9am 13pm and 17pm or something like that. I've had wires cleared the next day more than once. 
Yes, over the weekend is definitely an issue for banking as it is today but the point on SEPA is that's already dirt cheap, even cheaper than Bitcoin I think for EU members. If SEPA/SWIFT is restructured on blockchain technology, it will be better than bitcoin as it will also be able to correct mistakes and it will be traceable.
SEPA itself is very fast, i think the issue lies in the bank protocol to initiate the transfer asap and move the funds back and to individual accounts.

My biggest regret was not having sold when it was high to have more funds to buy more of it discounted.

I don't know how coinbase is set up because I don't use it. It should be under wallets.

Not that I don't agree with you that shorts are coming big time, but order book is usually manipulated. A lot of orders are issued but cancelled when price gets close to them.
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:48:22
I'm not sure how coinbase works but i assume it's like other exchanges.
First he initiates the transfer, then he is required to confirm by email, then the transfer is listed as pending (usually for a couple of minutes), then it's out on blockchain and should be traceable.
You can check blockchain for either your address as receiver or his, as sender.
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:54:41
Check my last submitted thread.
Also, some of those graphs you linked are repetitive because they show the same movement.

No, bad time to buy. Look at the price graph lowr in the article 
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:29:50
Bad time to be in. Get out and wait a few days. Worst it can happen you'll miss a 5-20% increase. 
Worst it can happen if you stay in now is lose 50%

BCash is piggybacking Bitcoin by insisting on being called **Bitcoin** Cash. 
It's just an altcoin that wants all the history and trust bitcoin fought for and gained over years.

You didn't lose them. I had some in btc-e too.
They've been offline for a while, came back as wex.
About 60-70% of your funds are already at your disposal and for the rest they've issue a type of IOUs (for each currency) which they are slowing buying back, scheguled for completion in less than a year. Last time I checked they've already bought back 5-10%, so basically around 67-72% of your initial funds are where they were before.
The good thing is that the IOUs are being actively traded in WEX and they sell for around 60-70% of their real value, so you can instantly recover around 80-88% of your actual funds.
I've opted to sellout my crypto IOUS because I assumed i'd make more money having the crypto and selling it since i think it is overvalued now and kept the USD IOUs which won't lose value over one year.

these ones yes because i was very lucky to have the creator of the script help me run it (he was very helpful in bitcointalk forums). I had no clue what i was doing but i've ran them correctly eventually.
The custom script in the replies no because i'm way too inexperienced.
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:45:29
That's weird i think. If a transaction was initiated, it should show up. 
That is, if coinbase initiated the transfer. It should be initially listed as pending, which means it funds didn't move out the exchange yet.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:00:41
It means we're in delusion phase.

Have had the account opened there for a long time, just started using it more in the last days.
I won't be withdrawing cash from there anyway, nor have i transfered cash, i go in and out of there with bitcoin. I cash out through Bitstamp, which is Europe based.

@_date: 2017-11-28 18:39:40
Most likely someone else had access.
You should look for withdrawal confirmation for that 2016 transaction in his own email.
In btc-e /wex there's a page called funds or something in which you can see the balance for all the currencies and their combined value in USD at the top. If the top one is 0, then there are no funds left.
At best you could ask btc-e staff to let you know if they have the IP which made the 2016 withdrawal.
They will probably be very slow to respond, particularly in this period when everybody is flooding exchanges.
edit: you can also ask the email company to disclose the ips that logged on i guess.
