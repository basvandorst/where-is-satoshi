That last paragraph is exactly how I feel. I dont believe in large government at all, even though it works in developed countries, it is simply not the ideals our country was founded on and I cannot support it.
Our justice system and healthcare system is fucked. I believe it could be better by leaving it in the peoples hands. letting doctors decide what to do. idk what to do about the legal system.
as for drugs, i think they should all be legal. if someone wants to ruin their life, let them. as long as they dont harm others.

I dont think so, it isnt an issue for most people but I understand where you are coming from.
It is the only way the program can use the tor network.

I see the logic in that. I like your brain :P (for lack of a better phrase lol)
I cannot see how pushing my ideas on the larger parties would ever work. As you stated, the GOP is very firm and unfortunately, they are closer to my ideas than the Dem's. I am all for small government and personal rights..
Social liberal, Fiscal conservative.

I am not familiar with waves but this client uses the Tor network to connect users so it is almost completely anonymous.

That honestly put it into better perspective! Thank you for the quality post! I vote LIB because its what I believe in, and I hear many people who I talk to say “oh I would vote LIB, but id be wasting my vote” Which is NOT TRUE! The concept of VOTE STEALING is very real!
I believe (correct me if i’m wrong) that 2016 had some of the best LIB numbers in years!

That relies on more people joining ;) Its like the argument "A third party will never win an election" I say VOTE/USE what you believe in!

I know right! The UI  is simple and easy to use and there are 
EDIT: SOME FEES!!! but very low ;)

It is peer 2 peer based on the Tor network, so uncle sam has no say in the transactions and cannot interfere ;)

edited accordingly :)

Yeah man, I havent started using yet due to a lack of funds but I will surely be on there! We need to grow the community it is a fantastic project!

I feel you, Zelle is my preferred method and thankfully it is available on bisq. Those options (cards) are definitely the most secure, however it being peer to peer there is little chance the government will be able to track the transaction, Mr. Escrow ;) I see you boi ;)
