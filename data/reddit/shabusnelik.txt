Well this also works with A--&gt;B--&gt;C--&gt;D--&gt;E. Every node only knows which node was before and after it in the chain. That means C has no way to differentiate between transactions from A or B to D or E in this case. In this case it's routed like the traffic in the Tor network which is definitely more private than transacting on the mainchain where every single transaction is stored and publicly available. Sure there will be payment hubs that provide liquidity, but can only relay transactions and earn fees. Choosing not to relay transactions would mean missing out on fees and new channels can be easily opened. When most transactions go through the lightning network, the load on mainchain will go down significantly which means less costs for opening and closing channels. You also should take a look at channel factories that will make opening and closing channels even more economic.
Lightning network has drawbacks for sure, but onchain scaling is just not feasible for a world currency. Lightning network is also certainly not the end solution to scaling, but an important step that opens up the path to even more layers in the future.

A hardfork should be avoided when possible. Sometimes it is necessary, but if the solution involves regular ever accelerating numbers of hardforks it's not gonna end well. I agree that 16mb probably wouldn't be disastrous for btc, but 16mb will not be enough and neither will 32mb. Bitcoin is in very early stages and we should be very conservative about what is stored in the blockchain until we come up with good. Off chain/second layer scaling solutions, since it will be there forever on all full nodes.

Not for just for one transaction. That's like opening and closing a new bank account every time you buy something. No, you keep using the channel. You can choose to close it anytime you want though.

I can use dogecoin for that, too. Blocksize cap increase is a solution, but not for Bitcoin. Bitcoin cash exists and you can use that if you want bigger blocks. It works fine on another less used chain but not the main Bitcoin chain imo. It'd be a short term solution since those blocks will be full very soon, too. What then? Another hard fork, ok. Increased blocksize cap to 16MB. That one's gonna be full soon, too. The only way to scale with blocksize increase on the mainchain imo is to remove the blocksize cap altogether.....

 A node only knows the ips of its direct neighbors. For the node a transaction originating from the previous neighbor is indistinguishable from a transaction just going through it. So except for the sending and receiving node nobody knows where a payment is coming from and going to.

Correct me if I'm wrong:
You can spam tx with a high probability of not getting comfirmed for two weeks. They still clog up the mempool and make txs in their fee bracket more expensive. After that time they get out of the mempool without you having to actually spend them. If it helps you pumping another coin you can easily offset the cost of the few spam tx that do go through. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:41:54
Yes. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:52:32
I'm not saying our high fees are exclusively from spam, but they do contribute to higher costs. If I clog up a low fee bracket I can "push up" other transactions to a higher fee level since people transacting will want a faster confirmation. Combined with poor transactin fee calculating algorithms in wallet softwares and exchanges unwilling to switch to segwit it certainly plays a role.

All the hash rate shifted over. There aren't many transactions on BCH, so they mined many small blocks quickly. Difficulty adjusting algorithm aims for a constant rate of blocks so increases difficulty.

I don't think that your coins actually go through that many transactions in a mixer. The point is, that you get different coins out. Think of it as a pool of bitcoins. You put some in and then get an equivalent amount of bitcoins out that are not associated with any of your previously used addresses. It's got its weaknesses though. If you don't use random delays with multiple output transactions into different wallets it's traceable though.

not preventing. But every bitcoin balance is accounted for. Every movement of every bitcoin. It's not possible to go back in time to make some of those transactions not happen. The accounts are only pseudonymous, so using advanced blockchain analysis software a lot of these transactions can be tracked. The authenticity of these records is as secured by the hashing power. As long as the honest hashing power is enough, you can be sure that the records are correct. Fiat doesn't have this public ledger and as such transactions are anonymous, at least when using cash.

The difficulty makes mining harder and ensures that a new block is mined every 10 minutes on average when hash power increases. BTC has a blocksize of 1MB as opposed to BCH's 8MB, so naturally BCH's blockchain can deal with more transactions in the same time. The problem with a bigger blocksize is that the entire blockchain becomes larger (naturally), so storing and propagating (bandwidth) becomes more expensive. If running a node becomes more expensive, then simple economics tells us, that fewer people run nodes which decreases decentralization. Because decentralization is expensive, maximum decentralization isn't always best though, so you need to find a balance. In my opinion, although raising blocksize to 8MB is not a big deal and still decentral enough, it's still only a temporary solution since blocksize scales linearly while usage if adopted will increase exponentially. Given advancements in infrastructure and cheaper technology, BCH may be able to keep on increasing blocksize until adoption stops increasing.
BTC on the other hand tries to scale by trying to offload most transactions to the Lightning Network. Within this peer-to-peer network money can be transferred instantly and free or for a small fee. The details on how this Lightning Network works are very complex and keep on changing. This, too carries some degree of centralization with it (debatable). There is tons I would add to this paragraph if I wasn't so lazy.

The difference is, that the currency is "aimed" at different people while BCH and BTC compete for the same market. BTC has been established as (the) Bitcoin. Forking off of the main project and claiming the same name just seems purposefully misleading. Why would someone fork off and not try to distance itself to the coin that it forked off from? If BTC is really slow and expensive, why associate with that at all?
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:33:23
I'm not on either side (but I do like LN), I just want to bring some reason into this. Centralization or decentralization isn't just binary. Having 100k nodes is more decentralized than "only" 10k nodes, but it doesn't mean that the cost of running 10 times the amount of nodes justifies the costs (in this case smaller blocksize). Depending on your knowledge, ideals and needs different tradeoffs make sense. Maybe claiming lightning is centralized is a malicious lie, then claiming bigger blocks = DEFINITE END OF CENTRALIZATION is a lie, aswell. If I were a BCH supporter I too might think you were a malicious liar.
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:50:54
It definitely does centralize. But to what degree and if that degree is still decentral enough is still to be determined.
