@_date: 2014-06-29 03:31:05
they write articles pumping some particular site or tech. Later when things go sour they delete posts, censor comments etc.
For example, last autumn they hyped inputs.io as a super-secure wallet, great for newbies, etc etc. Probably they were taking money for it. The site turned out to be a scam. The person running it had even been a known scammer! 
Coindesk proceeded to censor comments about it.
This was not an isolated incident.

unless you're selling person to person you *will* have to transfer to an exchange... but you can do it quickly. in. trade. out.
If you feel better, you can do it in small batches - i.e. not everything at a time. that way you limit your risk of an exchange disappearing at the precise moment you are on it.

that is only for a single specific attempt to complete 7 specific blocks before the rest of the network does. your chances of being able to pull off a double spend attack is *much* higher.

yes, and this calculation is only *within* one difficulty period.
remember that your hashrate is worth a certain number of bitcoin per day depending on the difficulty. The difficulty gets adjusted by looking at blocks solved on the block chain, not work submitted to pools. By withholding blocks at a pool, you get paid not 100% of what your hashtate is worth, true, but you earn a high percentage and at the end of two weeks, your hashrate did not contribute to raising tie difficulty. This means that your hashrate will be more valuable for the next two weeks than it otherwise would have been.
Therefore if a dishonest player has a high hashrate, they may well calculate that they make more profit from mining on several pools whilst withholding blocks than by mining on their own or pool mining honestly.

turning electricity into heat is always 100% efficient.
however heating electrically is very inefficient and should be avoided wherever possible. it is inefficient because so much energy is lost in distribution - in getting the electricity to you. Even of you then turn all that electricity into heat, in total you're only ~30% efficient.

and finally, why all the hate? the world is big enough for more than one crypto.
@_date: 2014-06-09 12:07:21
can't the attacker start mining on his own alternate chain right away? 


right. the attacker makes a transaction that he wants to undo with a double spend. So he broadcasts the transaction and has to wait 6 confirmations until it becomes accepted by the merchant. Simultaneously however he mines on a private fork with an alternate transaction.
Sometime after 6 blocks have been published the attacker has to be just 1 block ahead of the rest of the network.
anyway. I understand your point. If I want to reverse an old transaction later I have to go back and solve that many more blocks...

@_date: 2014-06-08 08:55:55
I think you misunderstand.
A selfish mining pool will hold back solved blocks and continue mining the next block privately, giving it a head start.
When the rest if the network finds a block the selfish pool quickly publishes theirs. 
In the recent past it has happened often that ghash.io "finds" a block within seconds of another pool.
At the moment, most pools are configured to mine on whichever block they encounter first. This means that the attacker has a good chance that it is their block that will get accepted. They would also make sure to distribute their block to many, well connected nodes. Selfish mining is profitable above ~30% hashrate.
If pools were configured to mine on a random block whenever there is an ambiguity, then the selfish miner has no advantage in broadcasting to special well connected nodes.
If pools are configured to prefer smaller pools (or at least to prefer pools with less than 28% over pools with more) then selfish mining becomes much harder if not impossible to achieve.
It further gives pools below 28% an edge over pools with more than 28% because they'd be more likely to win if pools found blocks nearly simultaneously (by chance).
This would hopefully lead to pools shrinking to below 28% across the board.
Edit: It is also in the self interest of the smaller pools to implement this change as it is they who lose out to a selfish miner.
@_date: 2014-05-29 18:06:59
in short: when you solve a block but are too late and another solution to the same block has been found, published and accepted be the rest of the network; this leaves your block abandoned... orphaned.
@_date: 2014-06-12 12:57:41
+1 for that.
It is like advocating for balanced budget amendments to the US constitution as a way to "solve" the problem of deficits once and for all.... but this makes any recession a *lot* worse because instead of the govt spending counter-cyclically, ie taking in dept and spending to counter a drop in private spending; these amendments *force* the govt. to cut spending at the precise time they should raise it... 
and yet you find people who seriously argue that by forcing this in the constitution people will magically change their behaviour so that all the complications solve themselves...

indeed. but back then they had a much lower percentage of the hashrate.
and I'm not posting this over and over to imply that they *will* try to reverse 6-block-confirmed transactions necessarily; I am simply reminding everyone that they are not trustworthy and will abuse their power. It is certainly not in their interest to pull a huge publicly visible heist, but there are a lot more subtle ways to cheat; from selfish mining to difficulty manipulation (  ) ...based on their past behavior we must assume that they will take part in as much as they think they can get away with.

I have been posting this link over and over again. It should be at the top of all ghash.io threads:
* Ghash.io have done double spend attacks already last Autumn! *
We cannot and should not trust any mining pool that large even without a shady history. 
In this case however anyone who days "just trust ghash.io, they'd never do anything wrong" is just naïve, bordering on negligent.
I won't feel better about this situation until the largest pool is well below 20%.

there is a practical point too.
Distributing the earned profits from the community run exchange equally among all people (democracy?) means that many people will be paid back fully early on. Thus all the small-holders would be bought out early and the number of creditors reduced from many thousands initially, to more manageable levels. Isn't this worth considering? It might well make the exchange more governable and flexible later on when the big-boys with their big financial interests are the only ones left and are therefore more firmly in control.
@_date: 2014-06-04 06:32:12
the funds have already reached you, you just don't know it yet :)
the bitcoin network keeps running and processing transactions even if the blockchain.info website is down.
For the future what you can do is run another wallet app on your computer (Armory or Electrum for ex.) -  and keep a watch only version of your blockchain wallet there. then you can see what's happening independent of the blockchain.info website.
You can also  export your private keys from the blockchain wallet and import them into another wallet app - then you can also spend coins when the website is down.
I know it can be scary when your blockchain.info wallet stops responding, but don't worry, the transactions are proceeding just fine.

I think AussieHash nailed it in his post
quote: " I have a theory. The network hashrate has just jumped up 14PH approx as per bitcoinwisdom difficulty. 
Perhaps this is a large farm, concerned about rising difficulty and wanting to minimize the impact of difficulty increases. They mine on btcguild/eligius and submit low difficulty shares (for which they are paid) and discard winning shares (so the network hashrate is artificially low). Profit ?"
if you have a high hashrate you want to mine coins of course but also to keep the difficulty low. This makes sense. You get paid for your work except when you accidentally find a block - in which case you throw it out. within one difficulty period this looks like it doesn't make sense, but looked at long term, this makes a lot of sense.

while you might be technically correct in part, this is only an argument for joining a pool as opposed to solo mining.
Blocks come every 10 minutes but difficulty changes ca. every 2 weeks. Join a pool that is at 10% and you should get just as much as from one with 40%.
people are downvoting you because your statement is dangerously misleading. 
@_date: 2014-06-15 13:44:14
there was another thread with that calculation (more than just one). They came up with a payout difference of less than 1% in the long run and adding luck/variance to that calculation made the benefits of mining at a large pool vs a medium pool negligible.

if you don't submit blocks, the difficulty doesn't adjust. That's the point. 
I think that explanation makes the most sense. 
Suppose you are a mining hardware company and you pre-sold a lot of miners. Now you are itching to use them yourself for a few weeks before shipping them to your customers. However if the difficulty goes up you make less. So ideally you mine on a pool and withhold blocks. You get paid for your work but the difficulty doesn't rise due to your hashrate (because no blocks found). You can keep your miners more profitable this way than if you let the difficulty rise.
Then after some weeks you announce that you are shipping to your customers, the hashrate visibly rises (more blocks found) and nobody can claim that you were using the miners yourself - you need only point to the apparent rising hashrate of the network due to your shipments.
I think some theory like this (manipulating difficulty) is more likely than a theory of trying to make some pools look bad/unlucky compared to others.

absolutely correct. But Luke Jr hates this fact.
 Indeed when ghash.io did double spend attacks on gambling sites that used instant-payout 0 confirmation transactions, he defended the double spend attack! ...because in his mind the gambling site was at fault for attempting to use the main blockchain for its transactions. 
It might be unwise to use 0 confirmation transactions... but that doesn't justify an attack. 
The episode with ghash and this episode with the gentoo ebuild just shows that he is not an honest player. 
Satoshi Dice *could* make things easier on the blockchain, but they don't have to. The problem is in bitcoin and that is where the fix needs to happen.... after all, if bitcoin only works properly if everyone plays nice and jumps through hoops to make things more convenient for others... then it is not a zero trust network and will not survive.
Bitcoin devs need to fix scalability issues upstream and not Luke Jr with his personal vendetta against gambling sites.

if you mine honestly and submit blocks as you find them, then you get paid for your work.
If they had been honest, then the shares they submitted should have been paid 200.
however since they were not honest, they were not actually helping the pool find blocks and thus their work was useless to the pool and the pool lost income because of them.
they claim they are owed 200 based on the work they did but in actual fact they owe the pool 300 for withheld blocks. Remember,  they were paid in the psst for useless work. They should have submitted the blocks or they should not have been paid for their work. one or the other.

Litecoin's block halving this year will be an excellent case study in the dynamics of decreased coin creation rate vs. decreased miner profitability in today's market.

the blockchain is all the metadata they could ask for!

seed restores private keys.
password decrypts encrypted wallet.
 If you loose your password, then you can recreate your wallet from seed. 
But you don't want to have an unencrypted wallet flying around, so you always encrypt it with a password.

then why does it feel more like bitcoiners making fun of people who like the internal combustion engine technology without being fanboys for Ford?

today I played as Litecoin... the bitcoin guy and I helped each other out :)
I ate doge though... and nazis and tsarist russia and imperial japan and nasa and an unnamed cell.

that's why you mine ghash.io? 
A pool is not a wallet! make it pay out every 0.1 btc and store it yourself.
any pool will work for this. I chose slush.
PS fwiw I also had 30 stolen by an online wallet (inputs.io - highly praised by coindesk as being the most secure)

wait for an update to install. (probably later today I would gess). don't go fiddling with /bin/sh - you'll only make yourself miserable.

I thought the genesis block's block reward/coinbase can never be spent.

or litecoin, or primecoin, or ... any other blockchain cryptocurrency

ask also on this sub fiercely hates all altcoins beyond all argument.
@_date: 2015-04-13 19:26:25
I believe that is correct :)

what is truly innovative about bitcoin is the technology; the use of a blockchain.
it is certainly possible that bitcoin will fail.
blockchain technology on the other hand is here to stay.
the bitcoin blockchain and bitcoin currency are inseparable, but the smart money is on bitcoin technology, not necessarily the currency.

Any word on litecoin support?
It was supposed to have litecoin support from the get go; having passed the relevant funding milestone. 
I for one pre-ordered one specifically for use with litecoin.

an attack? for example you could mine for the pool and get payout according to work you submit, but whenever you actually find a block for this pool you do not submit it. This lowers the apparent overall luck of the pool.

$400 000 000 ???
@_date: 2015-02-08 22:24:11
well my question is, were they ever real bitcoins?
was an exchange hacked and thousands of bitcoins stolen, or was the exchange a scam and they stole money but there were never that many bitcoins involves?
@_date: 2015-02-07 19:14:55
as always, check @_date: 2015-02-13 06:16:40
I cannot make sense of your question, but a double spend only involves bitcoins sent by the attacker, not any other transaction that you might make. They cannot steal your coins they can only take back a transaction that they made themselves.
does that help?
@_date: 2015-02-09 02:57:01
quote "combined losses of HK$3 billion". That's 3 billion, not 4 million. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:51:01
correct. 
this is in fact criminal. Just as would be for example a company taking orders and payments after they know they are bankrupt and cannot fulfill the orders or refunds. These things often come out in bankruptcy investigations and can end in ex-managers being jailed.
If inputs.io does not return everything in full that was deposited after the hack then they are risking prison themselves.
