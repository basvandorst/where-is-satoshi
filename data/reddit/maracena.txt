Transfer to Tether and wait for more dips. Then buy again.

I have a friend who did it at $5k. He pulled out his whole 401k. He was able to get 10 bitcoins. I’m thinking of doing the same. But waiting for the dip. ������ 
I recommend to do it ONLY if you believe in your investments.

I have chase and I never had an issue.

Exactly. That’s all I was trying to say.

Thanks for re explaining. That’s what I meant to say. 
Cheers

There are only about 16 million bitcoins and there are other companies coming out with coins that process transactions way faster than bitcoins. They also charging way less fees. Don’t you think bitcoin investors will leave bitcoin if this was the case?

Word of advice. Never discuss your investments to anyone. Not even family. Because in today’s society there are too many envious people out there and you don’t want that negative vibe against you. 
Make your money in silence and keep it quiet. 
Many of these you tubers online get hacked because they don’t know how to stay quiet about it. 
GLTA!!!!

Private key is like your account number to your bank account. 
Example: let’s say you pay your bills with your debit card. You can use your 16 digit number and in case some steals that info you can just call the bank and they send you another one. But your account and routing number is the information you don’t want anyone to know. If that’s exposed, you’ll need to close the bank account and open a new one. 
Same goes for private keys. If you have your private keys exposed, then you need to move all your funds somewhere else.

I actually have hw.1 for my bitcoins and I also have paper  wallets as well stored in a safe box. I also laminated my paper wallets as well. Check out this video I found online by the way. I got in touch with this guy and he told me that he will be posting step by step on everything he’s found on cryptocurrency. Sounds like the real deal. 
This is his 2nd video. Go to his channel. He has two videos so far.

I agree. At the same time there are many ways to invest in bitcoin. Everyone has different mindsets and different goals. Some people want to save to retire, pay bills, have passive income, gain wealth, buy a new car, I mean the reasons are endless. 
But I get what you saying. You’re right.

Why doesn’t he allow bitcoins as an option in chase banks for his customers to buy it? Charge like a $1 fee or something.

It's not a scam. I'm currently making $16 a day. But because the prices of bitcoin fluctuates, i sometimes get like 1 dollar less. You also have to take into consideration that whoever you are mining with, they have to make money too. If you read carefully their TOS, you will understand. I already did a chart with the fees and if you invest enough money, you'll make your money back plus more. Hope this helps all of those you out there trying to get involved in the crypto world.

Bro. Why would you do a transfer of so much money? I've been dealing with Coinbase for a while and thank god (knock on wood) I never had an issue like that. But what I would suggest in the future is to transfer it in where they would credit you instantly instead of doing the ACH. But damn 200k??? That's a lot. Well I hope you get your money back.
