Can I be your friend on facebook?
@_date: 2013-03-28 05:31:42
Good luck man! I ordered mine about a month ago. I hope I get mine before 2014.

MtGox as well. 
@_date: 2013-10-03 21:57:29
It's still down for me.
@_date: 2013-10-04 00:43:45
Fuck that. This guy is a huge scumbag. He deserves what is coming to him.
@_date: 2013-10-03 10:28:24
What a scumbag. I hope he rots in prison for the rest of his life.

Someone bought bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-05-30 02:49:38
When did you order it?

Drivers license and a bank statement. Apparently bank statements aren't acceptable. They verified my account anyway.

So cool. I can't believe this has never been posted before.

Wow, that really blows man. I messaged this guy yesterday about his KNC Miner. He wanted to ship these units to me. I wanted to pick these units up in person. He insisted that they should be shipped. He eventually stopped responding because I didn't want them shipped. I was thinking about posting a warning today. I really regret it.

It's slowly being chipped away. It will be gone soon.
@_date: 2013-11-06 00:04:38
Fuck this. I don't want Bitcoin to be associated with Anonymous whatsoever.
@_date: 2013-10-19 02:17:14
Nope, the highest it went on Mt. Gox is $169.98. ;)
@_date: 2013-07-15 08:39:26
This happened to me today too. What is going on?
@_date: 2013-10-11 07:57:47
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:26:12
Cool story bro.

Why are you being downvoted? This video is stupid and really cringey. 
@_date: 2013-06-05 04:17:09
2,700 preorders? Where did you get that number?
@_date: 2013-11-07 02:16:00
This has been posted multiple times.
@_date: 2013-03-23 05:48:35
Does Adblock plus block these images?
@_date: 2013-04-08 05:04:37
I'm not having any issues.
@_date: 2013-11-05 18:52:17
People are panic buying because they might miss the rocket to the moon.
@_date: 2013-10-19 00:12:14
No, there are a few listings on eBay.
@_date: 2013-05-03 04:14:44
$80? If it goes that low, i'm buying in.
@_date: 2013-11-06 21:23:10
Did you hear Bitmit is closing?
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:16:21
You can't drive from California to Thailand.
@_date: 2013-03-20 16:12:40
$65, baby!
