Feel free to PM me any specific questions you have regarding how certain aspects of Bitcoin works. I won't charge an hourly rate for basic knowledge like some other people here.....  
Obviously speculation questions will get a variety of answers based on who you ask, but in the end it IS speculation, and every person you ask (myself included) has no certainties to back any of those up. So be weary buddy and best of luck on you Bitcoin endeavors!!!

He's obviously a troll because someone made a well typed out post that suggests that, in his opinion, BTC won't go to the moon.. duh...

How about the Neo (or is it nano?) Yubikey that has the NFC functionality? Sounds like somehow this can be used for something pretty cool, I've just yet to think what that may be yet..
@_date: 2014-03-13 17:09:39
Awesome! Ive got a Pi and Yubikey, now all I need is the knowledge :-P
Sounds very interesting though

Investing = Increased Profits
Or just sit around eating chips, watching TV, and never try and grow your net worth..
@_date: 2014-04-01 10:22:07
Wait... What?
Are you implying I meant investing solely in BTC **with** my BTC..??
@_date: 2013-07-22 22:37:13
Can they convert the BTC to cash, or do they need everyone to accept the actual BTC as payment? If so, they can just coinbase their bills the next 3 months with all the money people gave them in donations, problem solved?
@_date: 2013-06-20 05:23:42
Wow, Never imagined how many would be interested in these! And due to everyone asking me for a donation link, any donations you would like to give can be sent here: 1G4GQkhvbcjCWBKGPmNidNdbuefjbH1r3T  they are not required, though absolutely appreciated! I've got to print a few more sheets, as I've been giving people a bunch of random decals as opposed to just one. That being said, I'll print more up tonight and get the rest sent out (to who sent me their address) by tomorrow afternoon. 
So far, 2 packages have gone out, many more will go out tomorrow!

Damn. once i hit bitinstant, it was at 53 or so a coin. after the transaction i logged into MtGox on my phone, and it was at 59. i decided to wait a minute to see if it would go down a bit before i got home. sure enough when i got home it hit just under 62. You guys think i should buy now while i can, or pray for a drop in the next 30 - 60  mins
edit; now just hit 62.8 :( im buyin
@_date: 2013-03-23 09:46:46
Can someone please explain to me what Moneygram to BTC address is? Do they just fill you BTC address with the value of your currency and give you the current MtGox exchange rate?
@_date: 2013-03-23 09:41:03
Would you say the BTC price will have dramatically increased or decreased within 6 - 8 hours?
@_date: 2013-06-09 05:08:18
You really don't seem to want to debate the subject. It's either "see it's so easy" or if someone has a legit situation where its not easy, your go-to answer is "we'll then i'll sell them to you".
So it's either easy to acquire, or if not just buy them from you?
@_date: 2013-03-23 10:45:17
Every bitcoin i purchased from day one has been stored on paper wallets. I'm as long term in it as you can get. Never the less, it certainly doesn't hurt to walk down the block to moneygram at this hour or next hour if it can potentially save me $10 - $15 a coin.. come on man..
It was just a question for some advice is all.
@_date: 2013-05-27 23:54:55
What does BTC-e's API's offer? In other words, what limitations do they have that Gox doesn't?
Whatever transaction conversion API's u need, I may be able to provide them if you cant find them
EDIT: 
I'll list the API conversions for all the coins BTC-e offers. BTC/LTC and LTC/BTC &amp; their USD counterparts should be obvious. Here are the other coins if you need.
PPC: 
TRC: 
FTC: 
CNC: 
NMC: 
NVC: 
Also can convert those coins into USD at BTC-e rates. Little more in depth (since obviously they don't have a PPC/USD for example, but it can be done :) ), however for iPhone users here, I've got an app out that does all that, plus many other mining options that are very handy. The test App is on my phone now, and it should be on iTunes for free this week. With a mobile web version for all smart phones out the following week. I'll be sure to keep an update on this sub for those interested!

Sorry man :( Sucks crap like this happens

How fast does Ziggap work? Generally at any hour of the day I can use bitinstant with moneygram and it'll be in my account by the time I get home. Is Ziggap the same?
@_date: 2013-04-06 10:42:18
Do they generally work like. "we cover X wattage a month, after that, you pay the difference", or "if you use more then X a month, we don't cover a penny"
Or could it simply be one or the other, or a number of other different agreements 
@_date: 2013-08-10 06:57:00
Email them. Their customer service is spot on

@_date: 2013-09-17 20:44:25
Oh shit! Check your PMs
@_date: 2013-06-21 22:05:01
It's good for savings, but It can be risky for a day trader. It sucks seeing that price plummet while waiting for your coins. But equally rules when you get your coins and the price is up nicely. You can press that sell button the moment they're available and make a nice profit with no real effort.
@_date: 2013-03-27 02:51:30
Fixed! Sorry for your time!
@_date: 2013-02-16 01:30:24
Don't need anything done, but sent ya about $5 to get ya going. Have fun buddy and best of luck!

PM me your address, I'll shoot you over a whole sheet as shown USPS. Just cut it out, soak it in water for 15 seconds (the back end will peak off) then stick to any surface, vinyl, wood, glass, you name it

I honesty believe Bitcoin could not possibly get any easier to obtain in my area. It takes me maybe 6 minutes max from wanting Bitcoin, to actually having it in my possession ready to spend. Numerous sources online, but for instant need, It takes a 15 second walk across the street.
However, I do know that some people don't have it that easy. A buddy of mine in Western Canada doesn't have it as easy as me. Coinbase doesn't work for him. localbitcoins list the nearest vendor 53 miles away from his location. Not saying it's physically impossible for him to acquire BTC, but there's certainly a big difference in how easy they are to get between where I am and where he is.
