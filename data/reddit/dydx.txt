Our Bitcoin who art in the blockchain.
Private be thy keys.
Thy trillion market cap come.
Thy secure transactions be done.
On the exchange as it is in the blockchain.
Give us this day our daily profits.
And forgive us our panic sells.
As we forgive those who panic sell.
And lead us not into forks.
But deliver us from central banks.
For thine is the freedom, and the economy, and the profits forever.

I first learned about bitcoin in 2010....
One year of Christmas money then and I would be a millionaire now...

I refuse to believe that ...
... but I'll remain optimistic.

The reason Libertarianism never takes off in the US is because of the anarcho-capitalism, "taxation is theft" bullshit.

It makes no sense to me that online gambling (with real money) is illegal in The Land of the Free^^^TM
The US government missed out on a tax-collecting opportunity. When bitcoin becomes more mainstream in gambling, it will be too late for them.

As a more or less casual bitcoin user, wouldn't this make the blockchain excessively big?

If you are having to ask kids on Reddit, then I would probably stop. It's up to you.

That's why you start small, like your local elections.
There is too much at stake to be a Libertarian rebel in the general.

Couldn't tell at first whether it was or I'm subscribed to all three and honestly, this post could have come from any of them.

I thought the Democrats were all about freedom?

Trump: 50/50 chance of good for this country
Clinton: 0 chance of good for this country
Johnson, Castle, Stein, etc: Can't win so it doesn't matter for a FPTP voting system
I tend to look at things analytically rather than emotionally and the above is how I have evaluated this election. There's no point in trying to argue with me on this, because I don't see it getting more complicated than that.
@_date: 2016-10-19 20:00:28
Polls != Chance of winning
At this point in time, Clinton has about a 70-80% percent chance of winning, maybe even higher. But I doubt Johnson is even above 1%.
