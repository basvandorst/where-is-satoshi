The usability.  It's just too complicated to do something as simple as store money securely *and* access it from time to time to top up my phone wallet.

It looks like the hold up for some of the Android wallets is bitcoinj which has a [massive pull request for segwit]( in the pipe.

It freaked me out.  I got 3 to one wallet, and 1 to another.  In all 4 cases my wallet app says that the "amount can probably never be spent economically".  Does anyone know what's going on?

For something like this, you should probably indent everything with 4 spaces.  That tells the parser to treat the content like code.
    Like this
    Everything typed on a line preceded with 4 spaces is treated like code.

Do you need a hug?  Does the revelation that the United States isn't actually Captain of the World so hurtful that you have to trot out all of your insecurities like this?
Listen, no one is claiming that the US isn't a big player in the world.  It's one of the largest markets (for now) with a good number of people with disposable income (for now), **but it's still only a very small part of the world**.
Look at real heavyweights like China, India, or smaller, more populous and exciting economies like South Korea, Indonesia, or even Brazil.  The combined populations of which is roughly **10x** that of the US.
The majority of BTC value discussions *are not in USD*, only the ones you see because you're an English speaker who frequents US-based media.  Of course you'll have that impression!  Pull your head out of your ass for a minute and remember that the world has other people in it.
And this business about US-based everything being the platform from which people are talking to you: it's just sad and silly.  Has it occurred to you that these "US companies" are most definitely *not* 100% owned and operated by US citizens?  Do you honestly think that Mozilla and Google employ a majority of people form your country?
And the Internet, this one's my favourite.  "A global network that was created by a partnership between the US military and US universities".  A **global** network.  Think about that for a second.
Do you honestly think that the Internet would have made it this far without massive international investment?  How well do you think it would have performed without say, [Tim Berners-Lee]( (born in the UK), or [Sergey Brin]( (born in Russia)?
And if you think that Bitcoin is a technology entirely developed by your country you need to take a time out.
Bitcoin is definitely affected by moves in US law and culture, but it's not a US property.  There's a whole world out there fiddling with bitcoin, wrestling with the legal and cultural implications.  That whold world is **big**, and it has **75% of the wealth** of the planet.  Perhaps it might be a good idea to check your insecurities at the door?

So far, nothing.  I had a withdrawal request sitting there for about three months now and a support ticket pen for two.  Not a word.  I then popped into  on Freenode and no one on there was helpful either.

At the time, Intersango was the only option available outside of mtgox that would do Euro transfers.  I've used them successfully in the past, but the second time around this happened.

It would be nice if the various Android apps out there could access your address book and grab the public key from a custom field.

I would disagree with the assumption that users won't run their own servers.  The problem isn't social in this, but rather technical.  In 2014, there's every reason to believe that a social network can exist in which all of your data would exist on an Android app that routes and mirrors encrypted federated data for the network itself.  Diaspora lacks adoption because of its high barrier for entry in this respect.
@_date: 2014-05-17 09:29:04
A service line this has to be secure and you're not even using https.
A proper system would store messages server-side that have already been encrypted client-side.  Maybe take a look at crypto-js and definitely get yourself a certificate.
@_date: 2014-06-27 17:42:04
That was my assumption.

I can login just fine, but btc withdrawals simply never go through.  I waited for about six weeks and my request to move 1btc never went through despite filling a support ticket.  I then cancelled the transfer and attempted to exchange for EUR, but even at a low rate, that never went through either.
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:44:55
Well given that this was a mistake and that I don't want to carry around the entire balance that's usually sitting just on my tablet, is it safe then to wipe the phone's keys and try again?  If I'm reading your response correctly, the address I'm looking at is just a way of saying that the device in your had has the private keys to modify the balance of the address.

OOh, yeah as on of those GitHub pages -- that'd be handy.
Of course I don't know whether or not GitHub (or Bitbucket) would have a problem with this sort of thing.  I seem to remember Popcorn Time disappearing on such services.
A better option might be a private [GitLab]( instance?

It makes me sad that an awesome technology like bitcoin is being used to evade taxes in countries that more than anything, need their taxes paid.

It still takes _days_ for me to exchange Euros for bit coins, as this requires a SEPA transfer.  We need a faster/easier system, say with credit card purchases.
@_date: 2012-01-16 00:22:49
It's that us-vs-them mentality that perpetuates the problem.  If people like you tried participating in your own governance instead of just bitching about it, blanket statements like that might carry some weight.
If you're living in Canada, the US, Europe, or any Democratic state, you have EXACTLY the government you deserve.  Try taking responsibility for your nation's destiny, rather than repeating meaningless platitudes.  Your grandkids will thank you for it.

* Bitcoins are difficult to acquire
    * Required photos and snail mailed ID
* Bitcoins are unstable
    * The price changes so much that of you buy $500 of them, they're worth $487 by the time you get them.
* Bitcoins are confusing
    * Everyone involved had never heard of them and were confounded by the process.
* ATMs are scarce and the UI needs serious work
    * QR codes are still very new tech for many: "this little QRC code gives me access to her bank account" -- this is how normal people think
* Much of this feels like pointless frustration when credit card purchases are so easy.  The impression Bitcoin gives is that it's great for criminals and frustrating to everyone else.

This sounds a bit like [Iota]( which isn't blockchain per se.  Transactions are made by clients in the network (tangle).  I'm not 100% on how it works, but the technology is interesting if you're into this sort of thing.  Check out if you're curious.

As someone who bought a bunch of coins a while back, keeps them in an Android wallet, and rarely spends them, this is what I read:
* Bitcoin is forking for some reason
* No one is sure who will win
* My money could be worthless
For all the criticism of Coinbase out there, at least they're communicating. I've been subscribed to this subreddit for years now and honestly have no idea what's going on.
@_date: 2017-07-19 18:50:23
So if I just leave my coins in my Android wallet, the coins will hold their value?  Honestly, I'm reading this like I need to figure out how to switch chains or something just to keep my money.

How did you find this out?  Coinmap doesn't appear to be kept up to date much lately.  Last time I looked, the only place accepting coing listed there was De Waag in Delft.

Well we swung by today and asked in person if they accepted bitcoin in their shop and the guy explained that unfortunately, no, they didn't.  However he did offer to do a convoluted purchase process for us where I'd buy stuff online and then he'd just give me the stuff here...  Of course we had pounds on us, so that wasn't required.
