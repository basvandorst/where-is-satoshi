what they said
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:59:37
Hackers. Shit if someone manages to hack something like the bitcoin network then passwords and all secure things online already would be in jeopardy too. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:10:06
Is it not possible that the exact same concept of shares we have now can be upgraded to be on its very own blockchain, though? Like the same sense of ownership and entitlement to the asset, but just recorded on a public ledger? Sorry still trying to fully fully grasp all this.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:10:50
That's fucking amazing. So happy for you. Now instead of buying btc with every check you can just take out the USD you need for the week! Beautiful stuff
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:41:27
Of course. One of the OG coins. It will always have SOME value in that you'll be able to exchange it for a better coin.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:08:19
Def have a good hand in some quality alts imo. Always good to keep a piece of btc though.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:10:33
What a piece of shit. Andreas seems like such a genuine, passionate person. Never really cared for this BTC vs. BCH debate and I actually didn't think Ver was such a bad person. But man what a dickhead
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:05:38
I can't believe we're still so early in adoption..
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:45:56
A quite excellent analogy, actually. Except even dogecoin has more worth than those things lol
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:49:08

Wholesome as fuck. Love this guy
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:13:19
Hey man you can use Gemini as an alternative option. Whenever one exchange is down check the other. The fees are way lower there too
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:39:21
Damn bro you figured it all out
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:47:11
I just think that if the financial world implemented blockchain for just a day, even with  all the kinks it still has, they could see how easy and seamless the concept is and develop from there.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:20:47
So fucking accurate he would 100% tweet it
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:32:38
No, what happened? Heard Joey Bada$$ is actually a pretty dope actor
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:31:09
For a more unbiased answer, Bitcoin Cash prioritizes fast, low-fee transactions first and decentralization second. Bitcoin prioritizes decentralization first and cheap fast transactions second.

Sell for a loss
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:27:02
Irrelevant comment honestly. People flood this sub with posts as soon as ATHs are hit all the time. And what's happening with bch right now is honestly news worthy, like it or not. I definitely am shitting bricks
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:17:54
If you did that youd be in constant "shit your pants" mode like my dumbass
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:16:22
I'm just getting a little tired of "hodl." Can't we just "hold?"
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:06:51
I know you're praying for a crash so we can all be losers together again :)
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:15:04
Every transaction of bitcoin is both the right and wrong move
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:28:20
I think that's what most commoners are doing
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:34:20
I ain't breathing out until we're back at 7k dammit
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:48:03
What these guys said. If you can buy bananas and apples for $2 and all of a sudden apples are on sale for $1, that doesnt mean bananas have gained value.
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:17:11
bad news bears
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:59:56
Wait a minute are you saying that you're afraid to press the "sell" button because they might scam you and give you nothing in return? Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:03:45
What in the world does this post mean
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:01:31
If you want your B2X and BTC coins safe after the fork then you will have to transfer your coins to a hardware wallet or at the very least a wallet where you control the private keys. It seems like with Gemini, the B2X coin could possibly be labeled as the original "BTC" if the market decides it to be so. If that happens, I think theres a chance your BTC on Gemini could turn into B2X and you won't have access to the original coin. So transfer everything to be safe.

I'm developing an automated trading system right now so I can lose money even away from the computer!
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:50:03

Inflation arises from printing too much money. Bitcoin does not come with that feature afaik
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:20:07
Although I hold btc and no bch, threads like this sure make this side look fucking retarded
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:13:47
Well regardless Gemini is the bees knees
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:12:31
Yeah sentiment realllly drives the price of this baby unlike conventional asset classes. Price also seems to always find support and resistance on nice even levels (7500, 6850, 6800, etc.)
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:17:49
I have quite a bit of money and time invested into bitcoin and stuff like this worries me. Does bitcoin really have to rely on a bunch of neckbeards like us to run dusty ASICs in order to survive?
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:05:20
I've heard good things about gdax as well :). Haven't really looked into the exchange though. It looks like they also charge a higher price for btc. Currently $6918 on GDAX vs $6822 on Gemini
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:08:10
You have nothing to worry about in terms of selling btc on the exchange for cash. That's exactly the point of these companies :). Coinbase is probably the most trusted among many others
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:35:14
Holy shit I see these atms in every bodega in NYC. Big if true

Buy high cry low
@_date: 2017-11-10 07:36:01
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:01:51
I don't expect the price to dip until the fork. I see it hitting 8k in the next few days easily
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:21:55
Not too sure what you mean by the interface. It's not technical like gdax but I can buy and sell just fine. The low fees is the reason I use them though
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:41:51
Oh well
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:12:15
Ahh my brother
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:32:25
i respek it
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:56:21
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:02:47
Switch over to Gemini. Very nice transaction fees with good prices
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:09:45
If you buy and the price drops, simply make up for it by buying more
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:19:05
Yeah these guys can act tough but my anus is thoroughly clenched
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:48:05
What if... it ain't over?
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:27:33
Thanks for sharing this. Very possible and I think everyone needs this reminder every now and then through the uptrend
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:31:21
This is better than wrestling!
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:31:33
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:44:23
Did you sell?
@_date: 2017-11-10 08:11:22
Hmm if you're just looking to buy alts and also hold, changelly lets you exchange bitcoin for a bunch of different alts. And it's not really an exchange either, so you'd use your existing wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:41:47
I put $1000 into btc for the first time when it was at ~3600 and then it dropped and I was down ~$40. It stayed like that for a week so I sold. Bought back in at 5300. Don't be me.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:35:42
Right? I feel that bitcoin should be resistant to "shilling" anyway. Who cares if altcoin people come here? Don't they have the shittier coin?
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:56:08
Seems like a good trade off for cheaper fees
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:42:51
Probably not for what you're in it for
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:05:14
40 minutes
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:33:49
yes to both
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:53:45
Lmfao I'm definitely praying that it does Jesus
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:26:34
If you buy right now and bitcoin has another crazy month like this you could end up with 1 whole dollar profit minus fees ��
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:05:53
Honestly good for you. I would be stoked in your position
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:32:34
Go to the other sub and you'll see a bunch of guys showing how they got banned. I personally enjoy this sub all memes and price threads aside. So yes. I am slightly worried whenever I mention bch without completely shitting on it.
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:52:24
im very scared
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:42:03
oh snap
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:53:12
People invest/trade with borrowed money all the time. It's called margin trading. However this comes with much more risk so you really have to be aware of what you're doing. Also since the money isn't really yours you'll be MUCH more emotional to the price swings
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:19:24
Even if you see a dip in the future, I see the price continuing forward at a fast rate at least a couple days before the fork. You could buy in, make a quick flip, and wait for the correction. Why not just buy now and sell on the 12th, for example?
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:11:28
This is the answer if you want to feel safe about your funds. You can get a ledger on coinfort.co right now for $85. And if you pay with BTC they'll sell it for just $75!
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:47:50
honestly good for you
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:20:26
We're being laughed at right now.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:53:07
Beats me
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:21:24
Not sure what that means
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:59:44
I think the smart move would be to wait for another inevitable pump and dump. People who were credited bch will profit no matter what
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:19:14
Godl damn it
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:35:50
The way you worded the question it sounds like you want a quick flip for a quick profit. $300, even with this beautiful rally we've seen, will net you probably $10-15 profit after fees if you sell relatively before the dip if even that. $300 is good as a longg term investment supplemented by additional purchases, but by itself it's not really worth the trouble
@_date: 2017-11-06 06:36:07
flip a coin
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:18:21
I would say a couple moons, 2 at most based on my analysis
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:57:16
I'm referring to the bch second rally
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:56:02
just keep it in there
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:21:21
Idk just sounded cool at the time
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:51:39
Then by all means go for it
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:59:52
das fuck is this?
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:22:08
Funny enough, I saw over in that they have something like that. It looks like it works really well too :/. I better not fucking get banned for saying that
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:13:02
Same this is exciting times
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:08:46
At least 1 moon
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:26:18
I've been wondering this myself.. sounds almost like an urban legend at this point
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:35:47
The Oracle, ladies and gentlemen
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:47:22
You're right on that
@_date: 2018-03-04 16:32:27
No way this is real
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:28:33
Got my trader pants on and managed to buy in at 5.4k but I only put in a small amount anticipating a bigger dip. Put the rest in at 5.7k :(
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:11:14
You're really not helping yourself. I've been up 1,000,000,000,000 trading on a demo account
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:48:39
Would the institution holding most of your cash ever be able to place a hold on your account, making you unable to use it? Or are you able to buy something without having your bank know where you spent it?
