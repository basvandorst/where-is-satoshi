news/hype was coming from the comunity
now all of a sudden people start to base their hype based on the media that laughed at them when BTC was worth less than a dollar

That's the same with bitcoin, you have to get it from the system, it's probably not the government, but with speculations/inflation/deflation and shit it is the same thing

crypto revolution? let me laught one minute
at least real world currencies are stable
what do you want to do with a currency that fluctuates so much, unless you like to profit from speculation / ripping, crypto currencies have no future, it is worse than current currencies
the future is a world WITHOUT currencies AT ALL

bitcoin lost 1000$ for its value in 1 week, and all you have to say is, " you don't yet understand some fundamental concepts in cryptocurrencies"
I clearly know what is the point of these currencies, to make large profit without regulation or insurance, speculate, speculate, speculate
You are just a financial wanker, you idiot think you know life better than everyone else cause you speculate on invisible stuff, go ask your farmer if he can feed you some food for some bitcoins
This is just vent, you might make some profit, but stop telling me it is "fair", "best", "awesome", cause it's not

And that's all you have to say? A link to a website about crypto currencies would have been better instead of just trying to feel superior in the internetz of the lulz, this comment further validates my own comment on you. you are just a weak humain, without your work in the finance world you are a piece of shit and useless humain who can't feed himself without supermarkets or restaurants
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:29:53
It is not honest currency, not even fair currency at ALL
It is the fruit of nothing, just bench of nerds who try to speculates like crazy
A currency that fluctuates that much and that fast is all you want but certainly not "fair"
I don't invest on it because i don't value "currency" as something that will make my own life better, there are other real stuff more valuable
Regretting stuff is normal, it is humain, what's wrong is speculating, it is just following what they already did with current currencies, nothing changed, only the name
If i own houses and you desperately need one, your bitcoin or $ will change nothing if i don't want to sell it

A friend once told me: "The more imbecile/ignorant you are, the more you'll have an happy life because you won't think or try to find solutions about all the bad stuff of this world, and just focus on enjoying your life as it is"

Lol, you missed the whole point of my comment, i don't need a link, i meant act better if you want other people to act better too, you come here say shit about people knowing nothing and instead of helping them you just keep saying shit, you are a bad person because you own some privileges, be humble, step down and go fap a bit

@_date: 2017-09-13 12:57:06
Exactly it is just like current currencies, seems like people loves to repeat same stories until they leave this world
I believe in something else that doesn't rely on any currency

you are either russian or chinese, your goal is to destroy West economy right? because global system is unfair to you, and sanctions made by individuals affects your country so much, that's the new war, no weapons, no virus, just economy and propaganda, you understood that's what motors USA/UK and the zionist bankers/media owners
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:09:54
You sounds like a dick
