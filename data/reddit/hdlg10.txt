How dare a CEO mansplain? Crimes are forgivable but he crossed the line trying to mansplain. Literally hitler.

True, but people pay more attention to bad news when bitcoin is high, since everyone is nervous about a reversal.

It is one of the most volatile investments you can make. Perfectly rational to be cautious.

Or bearish? A lot of uninformed people started investing because they heard about it during thanksgiving dinner. When uninformed people start investing, it is usually a sign of a trend reversal. Probably just a short term drop, bitcoin will still rise in the longterm.

If TA didn't work, there wouldn't be people who make a living trading stocks.

The aim of TA is to identify patterns in human psychology at a large scale, which is what determines stock prices. In other words, it aims to identify cycles of greed and fear, which cause people to either buy or sell. Crypto prices are also dictated by human psychology.

That's because human psychology moves in cycles. People see high prices, they start to worry about a crash. People see low prices, they think opportunity. Graphs and lines are used to measure these cycles. TA doesn't work 100% if the time, but it does give you a statistical advantage.

So how much money did you all lose? Lol

Or you could sell and buy again once the downtrend ends. No need to just sit there and watch as your money disappears.
