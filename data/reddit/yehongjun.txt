One absolutely key reason, at least for Australians, is that purchases made with Bitcoin are not taxed from a capital gains perspective. I'm sure this is an important factor in other tax jurisdictions as well.

Beautiful. This post touches on a concept that has become clearer and clearer to me lately: money is just a tool of measurement. Traditionally, money had a physical manifestation (shells, gold etc.) This was necessary but also its greatest weakness. It became a 'thing' to be coveted and fought over. Bitcoin is an advancement over traditional forms of money precisely because it is not backed by any 'thing'!

This is another reason why people should buy, transfer off exchanges and then HODL. Buy and then transfer into your off-line wallet a few weeks later. Ideally with a little gain in value. Report this gain in your tax return to show 'compliance'. Never put it back on an exchange to sell or day trade, only cash out for fiat (cash) in person (localbitcoins) if you need in the future.
"You are compliant good citizen. Carry on as you were."

So you transfer just after you buy it. If the taxable event occurs at the same (or a very similar) price to the purchase price, then the capital gains payable will be minimal. Just another reason to transfer straight off an exchange to (multiple) cold storage wallets as soon as you purchase.

Many 'real people' will suffer (often severe) mental anguish when they lose their jobs. It will be very sad to see and will cause me a certain amount of distress myself. However, new ways of organising society (and in many countries, return to older feudal ways) will occur. Humanity will live on albeit with less of a consumerist, materialistic focus. There is no other alternative unfortunately. Many 'Bitcoin enthusiasts'  are becoming aware of this reality and accept it. I think many will be ready to give and share when the time comes and the need arises. (And if they don't, I'm sure the good owners and employees at the Lamborghini factory in Sant'Agata Bolognese, Italy will be all to happy to fill that role.)

"Basically it can make the economy grind to a halt in every nonessential market." This is the key point you make. This is a desired outcome for many. There are so many factories in China and India servicing this 'non-essential' market that couldn't be closed soon enough.

If 1BTC was enough to buy a house, I agree, it shoud be on-chain. A few hours to settle with a bit of a fee. No problem. At current levels, it might be ok on LN to pay for a small car. Just like we trust exchanges with a Bitcoin or two, we could trust these exchanges as a hub.

There are hundreds of sentences, assertions and statements in this video, which do you want debunked?
I will choose one which I perceive as key. The fact that lightning nodes will become identical to the current 'banks'. How to debunk? Well, actually, it's not necessary to. It is accurate. Much of the existing banking infrastructure will support the Bitcoin ecosystem in the form of lightning nodes. Many Bitcoin exchanges will morph into the same.
To use an analogy, traditional banks will be like the Walmart in the context of online shopping, Bitcoin exchanges will be like the Amazon of same. They will both end up merging towards a middle ground and performing a similar function for the people.
The key problem with the financial system is not 'the banks'. I work for a massive traditional institutional bank and am now looking for opportunities to work in Fintech working on behalf of the new. So will many hundreds of thousands of other banking employees at all levels.
The key problem is the central banks. This is the source of the problem, this is what Bitcoin is designed to replace. This is where all the value lies.
The only 'centralisation' that matters is in relation to the block chain itself. Only this needs to be decentralised. All day trading now that is done on exchanges is not 'on chain'. It is done by the exchanges through their internal accounting. To have true and full decentralisation, that trading would need to be on chain also. It wouldn't make sense to go down that path. That should be obvious to most.
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:05:11
Peasant mentality. The opening up of formal, established futures markets and all the talk of the 'shorting' of Bitcoin by 'Wall Street'. Many selling as they are afraid of the 'powerful elite banking government officials' shorting the price down to zero just to dominate/control/destroy their naughty subjects.
Many people don't realise that the authority structures that they so fear are rotted to the core. They are barely holding on to any genuine mandate. Any mandate they do have is held mostly out of 'habit'.
The opening up of these formal futures markets is mostly just really smart thinking on the part of the organisations running these markets as it allows institutional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin in a way that adheres to the trading/governance policies of these institutional funds/entities. It's not as nefarious as many think. Any shorting will be limited, temporary and punished severely.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:07:32
Let me change my sentence to reduce ambiguity: "Bitcoin is an advancement over traditional forms of sound money precisely because it is not backed by any 'thing'!"
Bitcoin and gold are 'sound' (non-inflationary) money. Fiat is another beast altogether, nothing to do with what I am talking about. May as well be toilet paper for all I'm concerned. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:25:01
I guess IOU was a useful but slightly ambiguous word(s) for the poster of this excellent comment to illustrate the point - IOU hints at documentation. 
Before the parentheses was 'promise of future value'. Before written or symbolist representations of 'money' there must have been eons of promises that were remembered, particularly between family/tribe members. Our memory was the first store of value. Bitcoin is essentially a global 'brain'.
This concept ties in to the uncannily prescient predictions of Marshall McLuhan.

You are 100% right in relation to the similarity between fiat and Bitcoin (predominantly digital) as well as the key difference (your "inflation flaw"). The only flaw in your post is the question, "why doesn't anybody notice?" Plenty do. You probably just need to broaden your reading.
The clean and accountable 'Bitcoin algorithm'  is replacing the monstrosity that is the 'fiat/traditional banking algorithm' that is stuck in a never ending self destructive programming loop. It's 'computational flaws' are too great for any remedy apart from simply shutting it all down and replacing it.
The truth is simple. Don't be surprised and don't worry too much if others don't accept the reality right before them (and remember, many are paid on these subs to reject the simple truth). You are a leader with your awareness, not a follower - be confident in your understanding. You don't need to seek conformation from others. Nice work. :)

It's good that you recognise the threat. As for solutions, adoption of a deflationary currency is a clearly defined, actionable proposal, either in the form of acceptance of a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin or as less deflationary, more transparent and accountable fiat. It could 'work'. 
The solution(s) you give on the other hand are airy and light. What does 'regulated capitalism' mean? (It brings to mind plenty, but nothing amenable to clear, directed action.) A carbon tax is just paid for by the ever increasing concentrations of inflated fiat held by industry and government. And you will 'vote' for these things? So will I! However, I wouldn't anticipate any mitigation of the threat we are addressing. None at all. Lovely and admirable sentiments but completely impotent. Deflationary currency is the biggest hope right now. If I am wrong, so be it, but more time is required to discover how things will pan out.

The Chinese government is the biggest holder of fiat reserve currency. Western governments are in debt in fiat. If fiat became worthless, they wouldn't care. It's a chance for them to 'start over'. 
The Chinese government has justified the destruction of their environment by the massive financial gains that have accrued to them becoming the widget factory of the world. Chinese people are not willing to see their environment deteriorate much further. If the government had huge financial losses (as described above), it would be a massive psychological hit to the people. Something along the lines of, 'we sacrificed so much for this, and now it's all gone?'
I admit my analysis might be wrong, happy to be proven so!

Really? You haven't heard that quantitative easing is being stopped? Or the not so subtle hints about the U.S. Fed starting an interest rate raising cycle?
They are being backed into a corner. It's not well-known because they have to be very, very careful not to talk about it too much. The words of Central Bankers are in themselves important tools of monetary management/manipulation.
If they were to admit that they were trying to gradually increase the 'soundness' of their money, it would quickly be game-over for them and Bitcoin would really take off. It's a very delicate operation.
However, having said all that, I still think that governments will have no choice but to abandon Central Bankers (they are not the same thing) and associate with Bitcoin. So it's all looking good right now. :)

You are right, I do know all of this (first four paragraphs). Much of it I agree with, some points less so. I would just point out that I perceive an overestimation by you of the ability of banks to 'double down'. I work for a global investment bank in a relatively senior position. Have you heard the phrase from the Chinese language, 'paper tiger'?
Some might think that Bitcoin early adopters are the 'paper tigers'. I contest this is far from accurate. It is the established authorities that fall into this category, and there are huge numbers of sympathisers and supporters of the Bitcoin project within them. Just like many of the French aristocracy supported the cause of the 3rd Estate in the lead up to the French Revolution.
In relation to your last paragraph, who did I call an enemy? Not you. Not anyone else involved in the Bitcoin project. I believe that the people I disagree with (e.g. S2X proponents) are on my side. We are all working together. Their role is to challenge the efficacy of the system, my role is to 'fight' (engage in rhetoric, polite debate, question). We are all following our role and I respect the men and women who disagree with me. 
I also want to say, I perceive the biggest group at risk in relation to this project is the Chinese authorities, not Western governments and banks. I am heavily connected to China and it would break my heart if there were negative impacts there. I would discontinue my support for Bitcoin if I could start to see those effects materialise in any way, or if it became socially taboo in the Chinese people's psyche to support Bitcoin -  no matter my financial loss. However, my analysis is that the project will benefit ordinary people throughout the whole world, including China. 
It is inevitable that we will win. 
Love this engagement by the way. I have a busy day so if you respond might not get back until tomorrow.

I'm not saying that at all, I said it gives perfect reasons for not scaling. There is another post that could be created that gives perfect reasons for scaling. If there was more than a 300 word limit on my link post I might have gone into the subtleties. It's a balance... That is what the dialogue is all about. Not rushing, step by step.
If it did suddenly scale, I don't think it would be the end of Bitcoin, that's silly. Just worth analysing the impacts at moving at different speeds, be they fast, slow or somewhere in the middle. 
My point is that it's never a good idea to rush. Don't forget the '5 Ps'. Proper Preparation Prevents Pisspoor Performance.

You are right, it is almost certain that in 500 years, Bitcoin will be just a chapter in history books. This painting, God willing, will still be enjoyed by humanity.

To be honest, I don't have any book recommendations relating to economics! If I know anything it is from reading widely, not just about a dry subject like economics (even though I am a Finance major).
I will give a recommendation though: read history. It always repeats. My favorite period to read about: The French Revolution and Napoleonic era. 'Citizens' by Simon Schama is my favourite. You can learn all about how Louis 16th and his government tried to inflate away their currency until it led to absolute disaster.

To be worth nothing? Just scenario C. But that is obvious right? Everything is destroyed, who cares about Bitcoin? So, let's disregard that concept! Too broad to worry about!
A. and B., I think nothing to worry about!
In my mind, there is only one real risk. That Central Banks (or equivalents) start maintaining 'sound money'. That is, money that is not constantly inflated. If this happened and Bitcoin became far less valuable, so be it! Good people could prosper in either that 'sound State money' environment or with a Bitcoin 'regime'.
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:09:59
Most people don't. It will take another 2009 'great recession'. Shouldn't be too far away.
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:30:28
The only reason I would do that is if I truly believed that many people using Bitcoin on a day to day transactional basis would lead to an increase in its value.
I do not believe that daily use of Bitcoin would have any real impact on its value, so therefore I don't spend it either out of convenience for myself or as a contribution to the Bitcoin 'cause'.
It's value is almost primarily due to its 'store of value', just like gold. Money is just a measuring tool (lumps of gold, paper bills with presidents on them, cigarettes or clamshells). That is the entirety of its value. Bitcoin is a really, really good measuring tool, that's why it is very valuable. More valuable than any other forms of money.
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:12:07
There is only one risk for Bitcoin: Central Banks stop inflating their currency and start supporting sound money. i.e. they give up quantitative easing and allow interest rates to settle at their naturally high level.

Bitcoin faces one risk only. Central banks around the world stop deflating their currencies. i.e. they stop quantitative easing and also allow interest rates to rise to their natural level (very high). It is a possibility.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:54:14
Yes, it would collapse the fiat bubble and destroy the global economy. This will happen regardless of whether the central banks start to act morally and stop printing money or they let Bitcoin 'win'. One way or another, we will get sound money. The question is whether it is Bitcoin or 'State' money.
Again, yes, the world economy will be destroyed either way. The end of consumerism and undisciplined and purposeless action is coming, and I couldn't be more pleased. :)

Bitcoin provides a way for honest people to reclaim their place and position in the world. Honest, thoughtful, measured people understand it and buy it (and then hold it through the dips).
The 'mainstream' are not capable of this kind of insight, and it is the insight into the reality of the thing that gives people confidence to go 'all in'.
Only a small percentage of the population has this insight. It is my personal opinion that having this insight (and the above qualities I mentioned) almost has as a prerequisite a bit of separation from the exuberance and engagement with the world of the inflationary currencies (of the last 40 years or so) and the qualities that were required to succeed within (greed, disregard for others, lack of manners etc.) 
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:12:42
I agree. Probably only a remote chance. The incentive for one central bank to take the lead and stop inflating their currency is very low. It would cause their economy to be the first to collapse for a 'greater good'. Would have to be coordinated somehow.
Governments would save face by just accepting Bitcoin as an inevitable, unstoppable replacement.

The price paid includes two portions. The paintings value as a work of art for us to behodl and treasure with our eyes as well as its utility as a store of value. Because our currencies are debased, the purchase price paid is for, in a very large part, it's use as a store of value.
This painting is pretending to be a banknote!! It's not an efficient banknote though because it doesn't have enough of the traditional characteristics of money.
Bitcoin is sound money. It will gradually replace this big banknote when people realise they have a better option.

This is generally correct. However, many asset markets currently are being used as stores of wealth due to the unreliability of debased fiat currencies. So, a fair portion of stock market value should go to Bitcoin (or any other sound money that is more 'efficient' than these assets as a store of value).

By the way, UGG boots are Australian boots made of wool and sheepskin. Kind of fashionable here now (kind of... not really) and very popular with Chinese tourists.

Exactly. Then the powers that be start thinking to themselves, "do we really need to be fucking each other up the arse day in and day out? Maybe we can just go over there and chill out with our pants on." 
They start thinking about stopping the market interventions like QE and daily money market operations (money printing) that are required to keep interest rates artificially low. Which is exactly what it looks like they are doing now.
Bitcoin will either replace fiat or it will cause the central banks to consider maintaining the, to now, unthinkable: sound money.

The conclusions and assertions made, as you outline above, are reached by a process of induction, not deduction. Any 'evidence' provided to support the assertions would be easily falsifiable. So no one will be able to provide it. 
However many, many people will reach these conclusions, and hold them as truth or near-truth. It's very annoying for those that would like to deny these 'truths', but there is nothing they can do. Any attempt they make to 'expose the reality' using a deductive scientific method will fail. 
Conclusions can only be formed by weighing probabilities and finding links and connections between facts. It can only be done by single individuals when done well. The conclusions reached cannot easily be transferred to other individuals. 
Each individual must do that broad research, conceptual linking and inductive reasoning by themselves. In this space, the result of that inductive process is to buy Bitcoin or not to buy it, or to buy another crypto coin or not buy it. The quality of each individuals inductive reasoning will determine success or failure. 
Deductive style discussion relating to evidence and proof of individual points is a useful input to the inductive reasoning process, but on its own, trying to reach an 'objective' answer (BTC or BCH) it is useless.

First, you take a test drive of the brand new car. Second, you look at the salesman with a big, childish and idiotic grin as you listen to him talk about all its features. Third, you allow your sub-conscious to take over as it recalls advertisements from the previous XX years of your life about how this new car will 'set you free'. Fourth, you engage with the salesman as if he is your friend; even though every word that he emits and every movement that he makes is designed to cheat you into thinking that you are valued and liked. Fifth, give him your money either in Bitcoin or fiat, depending on what his company accepts. Sixth, drive off in brand new car. Seventh, recognise that this car is simply a moving metal cage that acts as a constant reminder of your impotence and submission to the cult of movement (and the rejection of action - the true measure of any real man).

As much as you sound like a crazy person, I think there could be truth to what you are saying. If you are right, then it would be a perfect time to buy after the fork when the Chinese government is pumping B2X.

What are people complaining about in relation to him now? Mucking around with people's money, yes. Challenging people's wits, yes. But from a moral perspective, nothing compared to the monsters he rails against. 
I propose that he is 'testing' the Bitcoin ecosystem and shaking out weak hands so that they become super strong after a lesson. I believe it is a distinct possibility.

Why not? Let's look at your title, "Block size increases should not lead to centralization if they remain in line with Moore's law".

Only one way they can 'attack': maintaining 'sound money'. Not inflating the shit out of the dollar. Unlikely that they could do this, too politically fraught.

Yep, at the time of the French Revolution, only those nobles who thought carefully and chose their allegiance wisely prospered in the new regime.
It ended up being an almost complete 'resetting' of the nobility.
The old regime put a huge number of barriers in place to prevent the success of the new. Administrative barriers and restrictions, really annoying for the new! But never really that violent. 
In the end the old regime and all its systems of administration was crushed. There was also a lot of violence.

Having only read up on tether for 10 minutes, is it possible that it's just a way for Bitfinex to connect with banks? I.e. They have problems working with banks so they created 'tether' which collects money from customers which is then invested directly in Bitcoin. They can't be too 'open' about the arrangement to avoid legal/regulator trouble.

Yes to consumption falling if you define that in economic terms (I.e. less demand for widgets, constant demand for food and essentials).
No, governments will not fail, they will prosper after they accept the inevitability of Bitcoin. Central Banks will fail. There will never be 'world peace'.

The Economist magazine recently published an edition with the article, 'the bubble without any fizz'. The general gist is that 'Low interest rates have made more or less all investments expensive'.
Bitcoin could be included in the scope of 'all investments'. If 'everything' is a bubble, then is it sensible to even talk in terms of bubbles?
If 'Everything' is a bubble in terms of fiat currency, then perhaps the questions should focus on the currency itself. This is the common denominator that gives 'life' to these bubble characterisations. 
Our fiat currencies are debased, they are becoming worthless. People are finding safety in houses, art, stocks, land etc. They are becoming stores of value in themselves! Inefficient ones! 
Many people are waiting for a more efficient store of value. Bitcoin is the best contender right now to serve that purpose.

I have already acted and I have a plan to act as we move closer to any hard fork. My current action is to put my coins onto paper and hardware (which I have already done). My future action is to stop buying closer to the time of (and immediately after) the hard fork. After that, I will act again. I will come on to Reddit and read one of the 14 billion posts that explain the best way to take most advantage of the two coins (whether that means to sell one and take the 'dividend' or to simply have the awareness to not lose what I have). I, like many others (the market) will choose the options that maximise profit and minimise losses (particularly through oversight/error).

This is essentially a 'forward' trade right (with a conditional component being that the fork occurs)? An agreement to exchange a certain amount at a future date for another currency. At this stage the price agreed is at parity, 1:1.
Is there an opportunity for someone to set up a futures market for yet to be forked/created currencies? Just having this might help to reduce uncertainty in the future when the situation (inevitably) arises again. Having the numbers up front/reality priced in early might help to reduce the effectiveness of FUD.

There is only one truly efficient algorithm that will become 'money'. It may or may not be called Bitcoin. Each individual needs to learn it's characteristics and markers.

If hash tagging and categorising could happen, that Bitcoin 'accounts' for itself automatically with each payment, this would bring automation of the economy to a whole new level. Governments would support automated tax filings for example. It would make users/uses of Bitcoin highly accountable, but perhaps a fair 'trade-off' for government support. (Not Central Bank support, they would be made redundant).
@_date: 2017-10-19 02:20:12
Governments can barely regulate their semi-independent Central Banks. This is for a reason. The lack of regulation and control is enshrined in Central Bank charters. Without that, governments would inflate all fiat currencies out of existence within a few very short space of time. (Greedy buggers that they are). 
Governments have no ability to 'deeply' regulate and control Bitcoin (such as money supply) because the code doesn't allow it. They can monitor to an extent transactions, particularly those through regulated Bitcoin exchanges. Law abiding citizens will accept this (or move to a country with more relaxed tax laws). 
Like gold, it can be easily hidden from authorities however, even if it was purchased with real details on an exchange. (Don't do that - if you don't like your country's tax arrangements, renounce your citizenship like Roger Ver).

If the Bitcoin name gets 'taken' and used for the B2X chain on some (albeit) large exchanges for a short time during and after the split (even for slightly longer than short - a month or 2), it doesn't matter. Don't worry. Just buy the one you see value in. Split them safely if the tools are available and generally carry on as usual. Things will be fine.

Just like using cash, it is hard for the IRS to track. Like if you just sold your Bitcoin on local Bitcoins to someone near you for cash and then just stored your cash in a bank vault.
The IRS would rely on your honesty to declare all of that, they wouldn't know otherwise. So like all the people on this sub, we suggest that you do the right thing and declare it and pay the relevant taxes. Our governments need those funds for essential things like roads to transport lambos as well as war and plunder.

Bitcoin isn't a bubble. Everything else is.
Everything else is powered by inflationary fiat currency. Stocks, property, art, all of it. Bitcoin isn't rising, the value of everything else is falling from the insanely over-inflated heights of the money printing central banks who are greedy for 'seignorage'.
Look up that last word. It's like a secret tax that our benevolent leadership structures impose on us all.

The reason prices of goods in stores are not fluctuating in fiat is because Central Banks engage daily in open market operations (i.e. the printing of money) on a daily basis to achieve a set rate of inflation of a 'basket' of goods. There are a LOT of people at work in Central Banks all around the world, working really hard, to maintain the stability of their currencies. The lack of volatility/change is an elaborate illusion that is one of the ways to keep people calm and comfortable. Let them relax and criticise Bitcoin for it's 'volatility'. If only they knew...

In all sincerity, I take on board the comment you originally made in relation to technical accuracy. Although I feel that my usage was appropriate, it gives me pause for thought about the choice of words that I use in posts so as to better remove ambiduity. This is not in any way a brush off to you. I will do my best to improve any weaknesses that I have. Thanks!

Buy on an exchange and then move to a hardware wallet. No capital gain when done immediately. Taxes are needed to fund 'mechanics' not the 'mechanics of a functioning society'. The less taxes collected the less investment in machines/steel/high rise/munitions and so on. More focus of people's effort on the natural pursuits (just one example of the multitude to illustrate: farming).

That's right. And because there are so many rules, being broken all the time, the government will only crack down in isolated cases, particularly on those who are a direct threat to that governments power. They are not Judeo-Christian countries. They don't have the crippling guilt mentality of the West. They are in a constant battle with authorities and it doesn't scare them at all.
In Chinese they have a proverb: 上有政策，下有对策。This translates to something like, 'the authorities above have rules and regulations, the people below have ways around them.'

Yes, it's all about self-interests. This is a fundamental principle of reality. The problem is that many people believe that it is in the self-interest of many of these actors to destroy Bitcoin. You tell us that if we don't believe the incentives of Bitcoin are sufficient to secure the system, abandon it. This is a clear summary of what these actors want.
WE WILL NOT ABANDON BITCOIN.

My understanding is that what you are describing is a soft fork. Soft forks are great, I agree! But from a broader perspective, my point is that soft or hard fork, it doesn't really matter.

The word 'lay' does not equate to 'incorrect' in any sense. Words are precise.
Anyway, good luck my friend! The main point of the matter is whether you are buying Bitcoin or not. If my original rhetoric didn't inspire you to buy more, then I failed. However, I get the impression that you are already a passionate Bitcoin owner, so no problem! If we are both buying then that is the only thing we need to agree upon. Words are fun, but actions are the only thing that matters.

Compromise with government so as to replace the current system of Government 'compromise' or 'partnership' with 'independent' Central Banks. Increased regulation. Allowing transactions to be open and transparent so that the government can use it as a tool for efficient taxation. Governments of the world then competing with each other to find efficiencies, lower taxes (becoming smaller) so as to attract mobile (bitcoin owning) citizens. Efficiencies leading to reduction of the current police state (particularly in the US) and the elimination of the phenomenon of taxation of the populace through policing.

Bitcoin can refer to the public ledger. The word 'Bitcoin' can be used very broadly. I used it in a broad sense and it is accurate and reasonable to use it in this way.
Modern humans have been indoctrinated to believe that basic needs have to be 'purchased'. This is just not the case. I'll leave it at that.
@_date: 2017-10-27 07:01:20
Exactly. The Bitcoin network is the equivalent of Exchange Settlement Accounts (ESAs) between Central Banks and banks now. A clearing house for wholesale funds.
There is a role for trusted authorities for the purposes of convenience (where the potential loss is limited). These trusted authorities will either be the current banking system (without Central Banks) or newer entities like Coinbase.
We (early adopters) and the underlying code (supported by the Core development/approval system) will play the role of Central Banker. Why? Because we (on average) understand the nature of money and have proven this by making our investment before those that can only follow.

The first thing to say is that it the tax liability faced by Bitcoin owners is different depending on which country you are in. Pretty obvious, but an important point if Bitcoin were to go 'to the moon'. Would you stay in a tax jurisdiction that is double/triple taxing? Would you stay an American citizen when FATCA rules apply (i.e. you are subject to American taxation no matter where you are in the world, and there are ways for them to find out as long as you open a bank account in many foreign countries)?
In answer to your question, yes, it seems excessive.
I'm Australian. Just starting to get an awareness of the taxation rules here for Bitcoin at the moment. It's such an interesting topic. In Australia, there is no capital gains tax (tax on the increase price) if accumulated Bitcoin is spent on personal consumption (as long as it's 'cost' is $10,000 or less).
But that assumes that you are actually paying for something with Bitcoin. If you convert it from Bitcoin to AUD, then spend that AUD, you would be subject to capital gains tax.
So, hopefully more businesses will allow for the receipt of Bitcoin! Allowing us to perform those 'barter' transactions (swapping the 'asset' Bitcoin for some stuff) and not get taxed.

Hard forks by their nature, have to be 'pushed' by someone or a group of people (or a corporate), by definition. I still don't see why this is a problem. I mean, yes, recognise it, talk about why it sucks, give people knowledge. But certainly not a problem as in something to worry too much about.

I was going to make a post the other day that Bitcoin is AI. I wanted to make that post as a defence against the cult of Satoshi that certain groups push. I didn't make the post because I thought it wouldn't get traction. But with this post it all fits together quite nicely.
Is Bitcoin AI?

For me, 'progress' is to return to a society closer to nature. Less high rise living (not elimination, just less), less screen time (in work and in leisure time), less car use. All of this needs 'innovation' at a personal level as well. Furthermore, the result, I think, is a more 'developed' society. 
Following from this, your logic is incorrect (from my subjective perspective). By my definition of the subjective words you use, it should be 'Less investment, usually means more progress and innovation.'
We can both be right because the words are subjective. :) 
@_date: 2017-10-01 04:03:25
Thanks for that. I'm thinking along the same lines. If someone else or others had come to the same conclusion, then we might have started with something quite different. However, I'm thinking that over the years, with the work that the subsequent developers have done, there is an 'end-state' that would probably be the same, however it started. An end-state that maximises it's utility (and value) as a currency/measure of value through a process of adaption (soft forks) and evolution (hard forks).
If this were the case, then would there simply be no reason to worry about hard forks? They are just part of the ecosystem, perhaps?

By your words, it is clear that you accept that the word Bitcoin can be used in a 'lay sense'. If you didn't accept this, you would say 'You used it in an inaccurate sense...'
Therefore it is acceptable to you (and me) to use the word Bitcoin in the lay sense that I used it. However, you flag at the end of the sentence that for me to use the word Bitcoin in a lay sense is not appropriate for a subreddit for enthusiasts.
When you say 'enthusiast' in the context of me using the word Bitcoin in a 'lay sense', I take it that your meaning leans toward 'technical enthusiast' rather than something on the other end of the spectrum like 'enthusiastic onlooker who wants to be a part of something new'.
Based on this, I contend that this subreddit is not for technical enthusiasts so much but for enthusiastic onlookers. There are other forums for technical people like Bitcoin developers/coders. Even though a lot of technical points are discussed here, they are often from a fairly 'lay' perspective. There is a very strong 'evangelical' focus, which you possibly don't like, but it is a reality of this sub.
Therefore, I disagree with your first sentence based on this. If you disagree with me, that's fine!
I will answer one of your three questions, lest I be typing all morning. No, I'm not implying we should rob grocery stores. :)

If 2nd layer scaling solutions didn't come to fruition, Bitcoin would continue to rise in value and popularity as a store of wealth. Bitcoin and fiat would coexist and complement each other just like gold and fiat.
However, these 2nd layer scaling solutions just further increase its potential. Perhaps we could say it just adds a premium by attracting (the many) who feel that it needs these features. Without second layer, it potentially replaces stores of value like gold and goes to the moon. With second layer, it goes to Uranus and beyond.

Not everyone is in a position to be 'swayed by arguments'. It's not always about ideas and the 'greater good'. Often with 'corporate types' the key principle behind their behaviour and self interest is love for their wife or husband/kids/community. If more people on this sub could understand that, we could quicker see the hidden motives, ignore them and focus on facts.
I disagree with the public comments of this Erik Vorhees guy regarding scaling, but recognise he is doing what is right for himself. I'm sure he is a good person and wish him all the best.
No point in trying to convince him, the position taken is clear. Move past it and let him be.

Then why would you use the word 'lay'? Something stated in the lay sense is by definition, acceptable in normal discourse, albeit not as precise as its use in a highly technical sense. If you left that word out, then your meaning would have been much clearer and I would have accepted your point (but not agreed with it)!
You say words have well defined meanings, but then you use them loosely.
Also, you say 'You just seem to indicate you do not understand bitcoin'. Most technical people will use the capitalised Bitcoin. The uncapitalised bitcoin is a unit of measure. Your words are far more imprecise than mine. 
If you were precise with your words and pulling me up for not being precise, I would be humbled and grateful for the clarity. However, you are all over the place with your logic.

Right now, the majority of fiat is lent out. When buying Bitcoin really takes off, many people will ask for their money to be returned to them. For example, bank deposits being withdrawn to pay for Bitcoin.
When enough people are doing this, a realisation will be made that many people/companies who borrowed the money lent out have no ability to repay it. A few banks will collapse and contagion will ensue.
People lose trust and never again trust others/institutions with their money. Without credit and the associated promises of 'value creation' with this credit, 'progress' will stop. The global economy would grind to a halt. Reduced fossil fuel combustion and hopefully a return to serfdom or something similar.
This is my dream anyway. :)

Not sure if its by choice or not, but I perceive a certain amount of humility in your words. I have enormous respect for people who are homeless and maintain this sense of civility.

I agree with everything you say. You are 100% right. From a broad perspective (you talk about all time and space), all that happens should happen. This 'Bitcoin' could be destroyed and replaced by a better one. Agree.
I will change my original appeal and remove the caps lock so as there is no place for rhetoric in a reply to your reasoned post: We will not abandon this iteration of Bitcoin.
It will survive the attacks from those that are incentivised to destroy Bitcoin and await the new version provided by a future alien Satoshi. The more attacks, the better. I agree with your logic. 
I will no longer reject your comments as 'machinations'. It is a very well written post, but I reject your main assertion: 'it's wrong to abandon Bitcoin at all costs'. As long as this iteration of Bitcoin is worth more than a trivial amount, we will not reject it. We will fight the attacks, and we will win.

'Bitcoin' is a broad term. We accept that businesses can be 'body corporate' in law. They have many rights of humans. Bitcoin to me is also body corporate in a deeper sense but the difference is it doesn't have a CEO and board of directors that drag it along 'Weekend at Bernies'-style to give it the appearance of agency. It has Core, but they can't truly control it like a board of directors can (or a government). It truly has a 'life of its own'.
Anyway, it's all semantics in the end. As long as it does what it is destined to do, I'm happy.

My way of caring about the issue is telling others to get their coins off exchanges here on Reddit. This is the most direct way to help others. In relation to notifying exchanges, this is also exactly what I am doing.

They are reading your comment and this response. Hi people from exchanges. Don't support S2X! There you go.

I agree. A catastrophic economic crash is necessary. And we all know that this is fanciful, the economic status quo as it is now has never been more stable and secure. Our leaders have put in place a number of really good and sensible initiatives following the scare of 2009. People just need to stop over thinking things and everything will be just fine. We are in good hands.
