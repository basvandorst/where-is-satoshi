Which only goes to prove it's a scam :P

I don't have an account on BitcoinTalk so I can't read these articles but see what people say  and  It looks like, although they may be a scam, they aren't pretending to be Blockchain.info but just providing a compatible API. But I'd stay away from them at all costs, those forum posts are dated quite recently as well.

You would still need a redeem script and you cannot know that it is P2WSH without the redeem script

I thought I mentioned this in the article but I might have missed it. The TREZOR allows you to flash your own firmware (e.g. for development) - one of the things I love about it - and it does verify it and wipes storage if it is not signed as well as warning you each time you connect it.

* That's not part of the fix
* If you read my write-up,  you would see that all confidential data is now at the start of SRAM so the `reset_handler` of older bootloader's wipes it
* As I'm almost certain already told you, a number of solutions are being evaluated for this - however, it poses no immediate threats
@_date: 2017-08-05 10:55:21
I think it needs the public key, but I'm not sure because I don't know much about P2WSH.
@_date: 2017-08-22 09:26:31
If it fails to erase flash, it will fail to flash your new firmware (the flash pages are quite large, some are 128 KiB and they have to be erased before writing to them except if you're only setting bits to 0, but will have to confirm that, which doesn't apply here anyway)

Please spread the word. THIS IS NOT A HARDWARE ISSUE, IT CAN AND HAS BEEN FIXED IN THE FIRMWARE.
While I'm not currently allowed to reveal the details of the hack, 1.5.2 does prevent the attack. The OP is just trying to make money by getting someone to buy his fake exploit for 1.5.2.
Furthermore, YOU ARE NOT AFFECTED IF YOU USE A PASSPHRASE.

You are actually able to use a TREZOR as an OpenPGP smart card. It requires no additional software on the computer and it works out of the box with GnuPG 2.1
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:05:49
You might find my write-up useful, 
The bootloader will clear `meta_backup` (like all variables) even after a reset because it resides in the `.bss` section
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:20:52
1. Agreed.
2. Agreed. But I think there are a few people working on a standard for this so hopefully it should one day become as ubiquitous as BIP39 + BIP44
3. You can convert it to words in the same way that a BIP39 mnemonic is generated, so this isn't a problem
4. \^\^

What do you mean by increasing the number of decimals? Using, for example, 100 BTC as 1 BTC (which increases it to 10 decimals)? Or simply adding more decimals (which cannot be a soft fork)?
@_date: 2017-11-04 09:06:57
Much more secure would be Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme, which unfortunately requires an offline computer to use. Each piece of the secret provides no information that can be used to brute force the final secret and you can use m-of-n configurations. I would like to add the feature to TREZOR at some point, though.
@_date: 2017-04-13 11:19:04
Where's the oversimplification? This is **exactly** how BIP 148 works. The only simplification on there is for BIP 9 and BIP 141.
BIP 148 causes BIP 9 activation because you're rejecting non-SegWit signalling blocks. So you end up with 100% SegWit signalling.
@_date: 2017-04-13 11:38:22
It's a flowchart though, so it's fine like this. It illustrates how each BIP works and you can connect the dots yourself.

This is great, I've been looking for a website like this for a long time.

Since you mention `trezor-agent` not working on Windows, I feel obliged to link a teaser video about agentless PGP :) 
@_date: 2017-04-13 11:34:31
I thought about doing the latter, but I already tweeted it and don't want to lose those precious internet points! :)
@_date: 2018-03-23 20:13:45


I think that a very careful combination of the MPU and interrupt handlers could allow it to act as an undetectable hypervisor for the firmware, but that requires **tons** of code to implement properly (I've never actually succeeded in implementing this), so I think you'd need more than 32KiB to implement both this and a legitimate bootloader.
In other words, I don't think this is a realistic attack for this hardware configuration, but it's a fun technical challenge if you have a lot more space to play with.

Debian 8 supported C++11 already. He was either feigning ignorance or being incompetent.
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:17:35


He didn't "withdraw" support, exactly. 


Just like the "Debian 8 doesn't support C++11" excuse ������ 
@_date: 2015-11-15 17:08:15
Just create a standard like the Bitcoin RPC... Devices just complicate things (especially when you're already in software!)

A lot of people will be reluctant to contribute if it continues to have a license like this so I believe it is in TREZOR's best interests to switch to the GPL.
@_date: 2017-06-10 21:42:40
I completely agree with you but I think it's important to note that the product has not been released yet and, as and have mentioned, the license may change shortly before release.
I very much hope this is the case so that I can contribute to TREZOR Core because, as you said, TREZOR is the best choice of hardware wallet and it would be a shame if they were to switch to shared source firmware.
@_date: 2017-06-10 21:44:46
It's the Microsoft Reference Source License (not open source but shared source)
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:44:18
It is when you use it with a hardware wallet as I do ��
