Ethereum's proof of stake concept Casper testnet went live I think - speculation that if implemented properly in 2018/19 price will go up

buy high, sell low - amirite?

Place a limit sell order at the price point you want, ie. percentage increase you were originally looking for.
If you don't think it will hit that then just remember don't get greedy, profit is profit in the swing trade world.

I had an Eth deposit take 12 hours once but other than that never really had a problem. They used USDT (tether) though vs USD, so that may be a concern.

Big fan of buying sub 17k as well

Were there any actual confirmed purchases/sells? GDAX had like 3 minutes of trading then it went away. 9k would've been a great sell point :)

Google coin market cap (dot) com. That will give you a list of different exchanges and their respective prices for btc

look at DASH alt coin, it pretty much does this. I think its 45% masternode, 45% miner, and 10% something else.

look at Monero for that extra i5 cpu - might make you some beer money by the end of the month

I like Poloniex, they are slow at times and verification takes a while but have been solid the past year or so for me.
