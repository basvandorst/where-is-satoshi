This reminded me of the little rascals where the race sign was facing the wrong way and then the race people swapped it back mid race but it was too late for the rascals they were off course.
I thought that's what was going on here haha.

Or he could be waiting for full Bitcoin acceptance so he won't need to cash out and be insanely rich...well deserved IMO.
@_date: 2014-11-14 15:48:45
Awesome, this made my day!
@_date: 2017-02-21 14:51:23
I'm going to hold off if it's a pump and dump to buy back on the cheaps. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 19:00:10
Not even the hodlers.
@_date: 2017-02-24 14:37:31
I had no idea, thanks bud!

It's so funny because at the end his face is just like it is what it is. I can imagine him saying in his head, "and that's the way the cookie crumbles".

Both good apps, thanks. 
*Have to give it Blockfolio, what an amazing app. Thanks again!

I was eyeing the $1110ish then fell asleep and woke up to $1200's :\
@_date: 2017-03-10 17:30:13
12:30 ahhhhhh!
@_date: 2019-11-18 17:49:28
ooooooff I feel you man.
@_date: 2019-11-15 19:03:39
I'm sorry for your loss man. I sold 1 btc @ $600 :(
@_date: 2016-12-22 16:38:12
Been hodling for two and a half years I wish I bought more. Damn I'm always getting burned saying, "I wish I bought more". When will I learn?
@_date: 2019-08-05 16:49:52
One can only hope for that discount.
@_date: 2016-12-22 18:13:08
I'm just in it for the long haul but you guys that are more experience with BTC what are your predictions for a realistic price rise? 
@_date: 2019-08-13 20:21:47
I feel for this guy.
@_date: 2019-08-08 20:01:31
I can't imagine someone buying a ledger or trezor and not writing down the seed?
@_date: 2019-08-19 21:11:44
Not being an asshole at all but how can you be so sure that the private keys of a hardware wallet won't be compromised?
@_date: 2019-08-02 18:57:04
As bullish as I am about BTC, 100k by the end of 2019 seems unlikely. I would love to be wrong though.
@_date: 2016-12-22 19:02:15
Not sure if he's a kid but wow he's creepy in the beginning. 
@_date: 2019-06-24 18:35:20
I would say buy up and forget you own it. If you end up owning a significant amount then learn how to store it offline.
@_date: 2019-02-06 18:28:08
So this is how these things start. "I heard the owner of Bitcoin died"....No, no you didn't. 
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:21:04
Do you really think this year? We only have about 5months left of it. I was thinking 100K sometime next year or something close to it.
@_date: 2019-02-20 18:45:47
TIL buy the high, sell the low....wait? 
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:31:04
It is going down again just get more when it does.
@_date: 2019-06-05 21:13:07
Three different crystal balls obviously....
@_date: 2019-12-16 18:58:31
Nicely said.
@_date: 2019-04-25 19:30:16
Can someone be kind enough to share what happened? Blocked from viewing twitter.
@_date: 2019-04-25 14:56:12
Always funny when someone can't admit the aren't fully correct. The analogies they reach for...gold.
@_date: 2019-04-11 16:14:54
IIRC it was something about buying the diamond w/ BTC. So it was like...."I'll buy it for $800....no $500....no $450....no $320". So I said it could also be funny with the price going the other way.
@_date: 2019-04-25 19:48:12
Oh wow. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:17:15
Because now it has exposure at a low point and if people start seeing it take off again they will think holy shit it's happening again and probably buy in. They will have that 19k on their mind. Just hope you're out before the bubble bursts again.
@_date: 2018-11-29 22:05:53
Because only a moron would give away their position. I've already made realized gains. I'm good, you're not. Later. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:49:46
If only I sold at 19k :(
@_date: 2018-11-26 16:59:59
Still on my way to the moon just taking a scenic detour. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:54:20
You sound like an ex-friend I had. I mentioned BTC at sub $300 but he didn't go in. He made fun of me for it instead and told me how stupid my fake money was. He linked me all the garbage articles...silk road/terrorist funding/ponzi scheme, etc..Then it took off and all I heard from him was crickets..of course BTC being BTC it "crashed" and he was back with the same I told you so/fake/ponzi scheme/worthless, I told him to go in while it's cheap but he didn't. Then it took off all the way to 19k and all I heard was crickets again till another friend told me he texted him saying, "holy shit C124ZY was right". I Guarantee he was salty for not going in with all the chances he was given, but I never said anything to him about it. If he was still my friend I know I'd be hearing from him again now, maybe you can fill the role. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 21:57:46
Of course I said IF. If I knew for a fact which way the price was going I'd be in some secret test facility. I believe it's going up again. How high? I have no clue but I know Bitcoin isn't going to disappear. The thing you can't get over is that I'll still be fine because I took the risk early on that you made fun of. Deep down I know you're hurting if you need to take every opportunity to show random strangers on the internet you were "right". Try to get more wins in life so you don't have to compensate on reddit. I'm out. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 17:40:04
Wow, it really does hurt that you didn't get in long ago. I had no idea it was this bad, I'm sorry. The way you're going about it isn't going to make it any better. I've already been through multiple crashes and multiple peaks. This is why I'm still saying the same thing. You've missed multiple peaks and trolled multiple crashes, this is why you're saying the same thing. One of us is going to get burned again but the difference is...if it's me I'm still OK. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:15:52
@_date: 2018-11-30 19:16:42
I used to get 25k, it was used to pay off student loans. If I was still working there that's what I'd do with my bonus. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:24:18
Yes, that's great advice and that's exactly the reason I waited for much longer than a short period. Like you said it was a great investment, I don't day trade. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 20:00:06
$300 to $19k? I'd say you're right, just use your salt for that wound.  
*Edit: Sorry bud didn't answer your question. Right now it's at a good place to do it again. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 16:08:31
You could always sell those alt's and use the $$ to buy Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 17:54:33
Why can't you just get over it? 
@_date: 2018-11-28 17:48:35
Give or take 21million. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 19:19:30
This is what I think. A lot of people know what Bitcoin is or at least have heard about it...even my grandma has heard about it (she thinks it's criminal money and that I should never own it, lol). They saw the 19k boom and said to themselves, "wow if only I got in at [their price] I'd be swimming in $$. What the hell were these reporters talking about?". I'm sure the price alone was enough to get them researching the subject and some probably even saw all the "crashes" that Bitcoin had previously only to find a new ATH. Is it going up again, I don't know maybe? But I know this "crash" is looking like an opportunity to get on the ride for some that never did. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 19:22:32
@_date: 2018-11-28 20:31:57
The salt is stronger than ever in this sub. 
@_date: 2019-10-10 21:09:08
DUN DUN DUN
@_date: 2019-04-10 15:25:38
That could also be funny going the other way.
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:25:06
Very possible...if I started at $300. I'm thinking long term but I'd be stupid to ignore how volatile Bitcoin is till then. I know your salt reserves are overflowing but please start throwing them elsewhere it's so hard not to click on the little orange envelope hah.    
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:15:08
I can hodl till then. Been hodling so long it's all I know.
@_date: 2019-01-07 20:31:07
When I went to Colombia there was a club called OMEGA. They used the Omega watch logo and featured the picture of Latin American musician Omega. It was like three-in-one then I died.
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:57:33
Right, I'll correct myself. You said it sounds like a great investment and it was. We don't know if Warren Buffet does what he says, maybe he got in and kept it to himself. Or he really didn't and missed a big opportunity, doesn't matter he's loaded. Putting money into Bitcoin is really risky but it's the same idea in a sense as buying stock. You read up on something that sounds like a good idea, you believe in it and hope it takes off. That was my thought process and I was right you had Warren's thought process (if he didn't go in) and you missed out (if you really didn't go in). So now you're trolling r/bitcoin for some sense of vindication. I don't know if it will go up again but I have a feeling it will and if it does I promise you won't hear from me. If it doesn't go up I'm still OK. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 20:28:27
Can you hold multiple alt coins on a Ledger Nano?  
@_date: 2018-11-28 20:22:00
Ouch it must hurt that much that you needed to go through my post history. What I say might not be what I do and what I do might not be what I say. It's the internet, trust no one. Maybe I sold at $18,999? If it goes up again I can just repeat till cashing out isn't a good idea anymore...far in the future. Like I said I'm doing fine and I'm sure you have enough salt. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:24:45
Wish I sold at 17-19k to buy back in at this price, but oh well. Been hodling this long I can wait till 2020. But why 2020? I've been hearing that 2020 is the new boom for Bitcoin, why this date? 
@_date: 2018-11-28 17:15:51
I know how it was meant but you didn't add the /s. I like feeding the trolls, sometimes they get hungry. Either way I see you throwing salt because at the end of the day I got in when you didn't and I know you think about it. Some other opportunity will come, be good bud. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:42:05
I was in the red for 3yrs then it went up like crazy. HODL! 
@_date: 2018-11-29 20:34:22
Ok, be sure to check with me again if it goes past 10k. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 20:47:29
I assumed the hard wallets get updates to patch things up right? Could there be potential of losing your coins during an update? Is it easy to accidentally wipe them yourself??
@_date: 2019-01-07 20:33:04
They do this ALL the time. Can confirm, I'm Colombian. There was a restaurant called Mario Bro's featuring Mario and Luigi. Now it's called Mr.Bro's because I think Nintendo was having none of that. IIRC the characters now look the same but with different colors. 
@_date: 2019-01-18 16:09:24
Good luck bud. See you on the moon. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:07:17
I'm guessing you'll just have to assume. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:53:34
When? 
@_date: 2018-02-27 21:45:40
Why do you keep trying? No one is arguing that he didn't pay they are saying he was smart because he found a way to pay less. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:33:22
With the ledger....if that ledger fails then you need to buy another one to recover funds or is there another way? What if ledgers stop being made?
@_date: 2018-02-16 16:12:03
Plot twist. They bought all the dips after they called Bitcoin a failure. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 20:13:53
I don't think just anyone can short a stock. IIRC you need a margin account to be able to short a stock and a certain $$ amount in it. The reason you have to pay it back is because you are entering into a contract w/ the brokerage when you short via the margin account. So basically they got burned and quick. 
  **Feel free to correct if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2018-04-16 19:29:53
My GF is an accountant for an investment fund dealing w/ crypto. That is correct. She also told me that if you hold your crypto for less than 1yr you're taxed at 40%. After 1yr you're taxed at 15%. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:24:43
BTW what are taxes on BTC and crypto currencies? &lt;40% ? 
@_date: 2018-12-20 16:53:00
Is there a good how-to out there for using Ledger? 
@_date: 2019-05-16 17:51:04
I think what he/she is trying to say is that cyrpto is really volatile and certain people that jump into it aren't exactly sure why other than they heard it's quick money. So when they see a 5%-20% drop in just a few hours they panic sell, lose money and then shit talk crypto to all that will listen. In short don't talk shit about the kitchen because you can't stand the heat.
@_date: 2018-12-18 19:13:22
I started buying at $300 then $400 then $600...etc. It went up to like $1,200 and I was so hyped. Then it all fell to $250 for what felt like forever. Didn't sell tho. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 19:17:30
He/she also assumes people found out about it the same time they did and that no one bought &lt;$1,000. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 20:33:16
Is it safer to keep your coins on those exchanges instead? Isn't it the same risk keeping it on an exchange? Not trolling...legitimate question I want to GTFO of Coinbase.

Pretty symbolic as if to say these paper bills are worthless, just rip them up. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 22:03:28
What then is the best way to store? Paper wallet? I'm not a tech noob but I'm also no expert. Is there an easy way to do this/understand how to? Seems like so many things can go wrong attempting to do it. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:46:23
New to coinbase here's what I don't understand...
5 Bitcoins for $3,015 if it was available today however it's not I have to wait until Monday and I need to agree that the amout of coins I get depends on future exchange rates.
So, if I give them $3,015 today will they only give me what $3,015 can buy on Monday or will they get me 5 coins at what whatever the price is on Monday which could be way over $3,015.
