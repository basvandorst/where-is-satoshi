The more Bitcoin is used the less usable it becomes.
If lightning network has the same adoption rate as segwit (lightning network is much harder to implement than segwit btw), it will take years for majority adoption.

What will decrease fees for larger transactions?

I own both BTC and XRB, but I gotta admit I'm losing faith in this sub.
@_date: 2018-01-14 00:29:56
This title is so misleading it's actually hilarious.
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:34:01
From what I have read, complete segwit activation will only effectively double the current blocksize.
That's not actually that much of an improvement for large transaction fees.

What alts are you trying to buy?
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:21:54
Remember when T_D tried to boycott Reddit and go to Voat, only to discover that people on Voat were even more crazy and racist?
That was hilarious. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:47:23
Already bought $300 :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:24:34
You bought 406BTC for $7.4.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:22:00
That's actually genius.
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:48:45
RaiBlocks is incredible :D

Not as much as fox news.
"Bitcoin fell to 3 year low" my ass.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:29:52
Good to know, thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:36:42
I thought buying at 2600 was stupid.
Glad I was wrong :)
@_date: 2018-09-30 14:37:32
This sub is pretty fucking retarded sometimes.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:01:17
I was going to say, people don't say "Buy bitcoins" anymore unless they have serious cash to throw around.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:20:15
Is there no way to pay somebody else to mine for you?
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:24:59
I bought a 14k. I made the right call.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:21:02
This is gold.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:52:57
Seriously though, You should not be investing enough in bitcoin to ever consider suicide.
Only invest what you can afford to lose.

Excellent Car the Focus RS.
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:46:36
Why exactly shouldn't you store coins on exchanges?
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:13:45
Absolutely not.
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:58:00
And up we go!
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:48:49


That's honestly the biggest reason I haven't stored my coins locally yet.
I just bought BTC for the first time 3 weeks ago and I am still wrapping my head around the whole concept.
@_date: 2017-08-31 04:14:40
That fucking sucks 
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:06:55
I doubt even 10% of people who own BTC and and BCH understand this.
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:09:45
I apologize, I misinterpreted what you said.
@_date: 2017-08-23 04:07:27
It's going to take a minimum of 80 years before that happens.
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:56:06
Thanks, most people here have recommended Breadwallet. 
I think I'll try it out.
@_date: 2017-08-30 17:59:54
I'm fairly certain that defacing federal currency is illegal
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:35:42
Fixed that for you.
@_date: 2019-06-17 15:15:03
Seriously, this is beyond fake.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:51:34
The Winklevoss twins have 1M Bitcoin if I remember correctly.
@_date: 2019-04-24 16:06:08
Absolutely not, Bitcoin is already dated tech.
@_date: 2017-09-02 03:23:46
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:56:59
Don't listen, Coinbase is the most safe and secure by a wide margin.
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:08:33
Think about it, a ton of people have sell orders at $5,000, so buying at $5,000 means it's almost instantly going to dip down to $4900.
If it climbs at least a hundred dollars about $5,000 it's a safer buy. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 06:08:28
Somebody just post this with (Bitcoin = $Grahams number) so we can be done with this. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:55:09
I broke the cycle at ~2600
Been pretty damn happy so far :)
@_date: 2017-09-02 05:55:59
Lol it just dropped $400 in 2 hours.
@_date: 2017-09-02 03:10:59
I've made $1,500 profit total.
@_date: 2017-09-23 16:20:09
Let's face it, most ELI5 answers are actually ELI18.
Regardless, this is a great explanation.
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:59:37
Commenting here for history.
@_date: 2017-09-02 03:15:03
It did actually hit $5,013
@_date: 2017-09-02 03:14:21
Called it an hour ago:

Yes please
@_date: 2017-07-29 20:47:51
Ok so a few days ago I bought $500 worth of BTC (first time) using Coinbase.
I was not aware that there was a 7 day transfer period so at the moment my BTC is going to be delivered to me on August 1st.
How fucked am I?
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:35:48
Stock market tanks, bitcoin price shoots up, media reports on it, increasing it further.
@_date: 2017-07-30 08:01:18
Nope, It's "arriving" on the 1st.
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:34:52
I'm setting a stop limit order at 1K below the current price.
I'm not going to be as greedy as I was last last bull run.
Rip all that Nano money :/
