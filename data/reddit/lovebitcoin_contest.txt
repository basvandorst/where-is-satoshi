One guy made an animated video. The purpose of the contest is to show the world that there are real people who love Bitcoin. You could get someone who is more comfortable on camera and film them if you like. Or you can press record and talk to camera and be honest; we love Bitcoin for so many reasons, just name one or two and why.  Simply by entering you have a chance to win the Trezor.

~43% Downvote?  Am I missing something here? Does she make invalid points?  Is it the cleavage? Are people angry about something?

Yeah it's very frustrating. Especially because this contest is aimed at community development and helping promote Bitcoin and its benefits. I feel that Saffron's video should be able to outpace this down-vote brigade.
