Know why are getting in. Know your risk profile and tolerance for losses. What is your goal? When are you entering the market? If you are right, when do you take profit? If you're wrong, where do you get out? Have a plan and stick with it.
Basic stuff but just knowing a bit about yourself and goals will go a long way so you aren't stressed out over this space. Also, ignore 99% of news out there as it's created to generated hype/fud to get people to panic buy/sell.

Fortunately there are some good workarounds for this issue. Using VPNs and tunneling technology helps bypass firewall policies. Using satellite connectivity is another potential means of working around the issue. This can kind of turn into one of those cat and mouse games but if there will is there, people will find a way to allow for the application to continue to operate regardless of state policy.

Trading becomes only slightly more difficult for those in China. Longterm, this is inconsequential news.

Look at you. Continuing to push your agenda. I bet that bag of LTC your holding is starting to smell extra shitty now, huh?

There's too much momentum to not reach a compromise at some point. What form that will take, is anyone's guess. From my perspective, this is more of a people problem than a technical one. We are slow to adapt change when it comes to commerce. The arguments will continue in the meantime.

The market has spoken. Look at where we are at now, along with the activity that brought us here. That tells you a lot more than any explanation in this thread could.

This isn't always the case. Localbitcoins is usually 10-15% higher. Bitfinex has also been a bit higher than GDAX lately as well.

The correction already started two days ago. Anytime an asset goes parabolic, there's going to be a clean up period. People don't like paying fees but that's the only thing that can be done at this very moment.
People new to Bitcoin are going to get a rude awakening for not doing their research and buying at the top of the market.
What makes you say BTC is outdated? Seems like a really shortsighted statement. Personally, I still find it to be one of the most revolutionary technologies I've ever seen.
@_date: 2017-05-14 16:51:26
Possible yes, profitable and worth while (and legal), probably not. Mining bitcoin is only effective with asic processors anymore. 
Go do some research...
@_date: 2017-05-17 03:07:11
The hash rate and adoption is nowhere near what bitcoin is. That said, transactions will confirm quicker with less fees but you're working with something isn't as universally accepted and liquid as bitcoin.

Could be a bug with the wallet. I'd recommend contacting blockchain support. That's likely the only way to get this resolved. Should you get your funds back, I'd recommend moving to a wallet where you have the ability to control the private keys.

That dip is going to be healthy for long term growth of bitcoin. You can't go that far up that quick without expecting this stuff to happen. That's just basic market knowledge...
If you're that upset with Bitcoin, there are hundreds of shitcoins that aren't as secure, more centralized and are usually scam central for you to hop on board with...
@_date: 2017-05-13 23:47:09
Much more likely because we've been seeing all time highs lately.
@_date: 2017-05-17 03:09:55
There is more correcting to be done before we are back in a good buy zone. Getting closer though.

Lulz. For a second, I thought I was in r/buttcoin and had to double check.
@_date: 2017-05-17 03:24:41
Stick with bitcoin.

You're right, Bitcoin is king. With the scaling situation in mind, it still has the best track record than any of the alt coins out there, by far.
People always start complaining about the backlog of unconfirmed transactions whenever there is a rally in price. Nothing new there. Bottom line, the technology still works. If you want your transaction to go through faster, then increase the fee.
What will be interesting is to see if the scaling FUD will return with the same sentiment that it did a couple months ago now that BU has been confirmed unfit for production. There were also the ASICboost and antbleed situations uncovered. There's always a scandal surrounding it, but I can only imagine what's next.
Do you base your price correction on technical analysis or just a rough guess?
@_date: 2017-05-12 16:04:28
Depends on how high/low you set the fee at. In general, I would recommend checking the mempool before sending a transaction to set the expectation. At the moment, you can expect to wait a bit for it to clear if the fee was set too low.
@_date: 2017-05-12 15:35:20
Specific crypto or everything?
@_date: 2017-05-17 03:56:29
You were a smart buyer in that case and still well in profitable range.  Good work.
I don't keep an eye on the LTC/USD pair much but the range to start looking to buy again for LTC/BTC is between .007-.01.

So long as they are patient and don't panic sell, which a lot have.

Backlog of unconfirmed transactions.

Unspent outputs, yo.

Long on bitcoin here, but literally every step of your process you listed is a recipe to get rekt...

Processing time is likely the biggest difference at the moment. Coinbase is dealing with a huge influx of users that it has to verify before fulfilling orders. ATMs will likely also require personal information but shouldn't go to the extent that Coinbase will. There's also a noticeable price spread between the two.
Really kind of depends why you're looking to buy bitcoin and what for.

The assumption will be that the value will be so high that the network can exist only on fees. At present, miners are incentivized with block rewards as well as fees.
@_date: 2017-06-15 02:54:30
Not with current or foreseeable implementations. Without fees or block rewards, there is no incentive for miners to spend the big bucks on the equipment and electricity used to secure the network.
