Mostly BS. 
Whatever I think are the next 5 upcoming events to push Bitcoin adoption and capitalization (exchange rate) :
* Major retailers adoption (I.E. Amazon, Google Play,  Apple, ebay). 
* Gain support as intangible asset by offshore legislations (as they did with thousands banks w/o even have a tangible office worldwide). 
* A compensation mechanism which help to stabilize Bitcoin exchange 
* ban any mining pool with more than 10% hash power. 
* purgue the blockchain from records on empty wallets (irrelevant wallets) older than 6 months, while keeping a historic backup somewhere by 5 years (at some backup facilities). - banks do the same on dead accounts)

the best approach is to build your own mixed cypher based on proven cypher, specially anti-quantum cypher, using code peer reviewed its a must, combine it with stenography and don't care what a moron law and backdoor is capable for, you are far beyond.

Sorry Sir, but you actually don't understand what's cryptography and code-breaking while actually is automated task cyphers go far beyond, right now we have Anti-Quantum Cypher capable to withstand code-breaking from a theoretical quantum computer, its not the history of 3DES or Blowfish which with enough compute power is matter of minutes to weeks or months to decipher, current strong 128 and 256 bits symmetric cypher as AES are impossible to break before the quantum computer (already there are few approach to a quantum computer but none yes is enough functional to be used as codebreaker).

This statement will be true when mining won't be monopolized by a single country (a communist one): China

Simply, if your setup don't break even in 3 months before a Year you'll be in bankruptcy, Bitcoin won't recovery and back to steady positive growing unless Chinese mining Monopoly is broken and change from POW to POS and transactions speed up to less than 30 seconds, and are cheaper than credit card, only then Bitcoin will comeback from nightmares zone to heaven dream zone.
In general I don't advise to buy mining hardware unless is ultra cheap, consider how much value Bitcoin lost in just 3 months, following similar behavior if your rig break even in 3 months w/o markets falling, with this falling it will break even in 6 months and maybe in a Year your profits will be around 20%.
If you're smart enough don't follow syrens singing HODL as the mythological creature all they want is your soul.

What I see here it's an future republican candidate, or somebody really moron.
* Fact no Backdoor is safe forever it's mathematical proven. 
* Fact US laws are only for US citizen that obeys the laws, those on unlawful activities or in foreign countries simple will use non US made software or self made software to protect their digital assets (to name it somehow). 
* I assume on the FBI there is enough people capable to understand the impossibility and lame usability of the matter discussed (Backdoor and magic master key). 
* Which take advantage on those surveillance super powers beyond right policemen? Those corrupt policemen seeking for Bitcoin or something to use to get money from honest people (dishonest people won't be as naive to expose their secret) and of course the big brother (those behind the power) that always look for advantages as to spy independent inventors just to steal ideas for even to sociopath just looking for depressed girls ready to be their sex slaves). 
* I thrust on the police and the state as institutions but I don't trust on policemen or state agents ad individuals because they're humans and as most of them are right always ever will be some corrupt elements, and those corrupt policemen with those super powers to break the privacy are the real enemy of honest people.
I'm expert on cryptography and IT security, and I'll be happy there will be a magic method to catch all the evil people specially durglords pedophile terrorist and radical communists, but sorry Backdoor clear is not the solution, even it's the nightmare of the IT security.

Ok, lets see in perspective, if you replay yes and send me 100.000 bitcoins I'll deliver the golden gate brige where ever you want, 100% warranted, no joke I'm not a Lier, I'm authorized by San Francisco city to sell the Golden Gate bridge, all you need to do is to send me the bitcoinx and I'll ship the damm bridge to you on next day...
So why not buy the Golden Gate?
Sorry, I've seem too much fraud on those on-line bullion scams or ponzi-schemes.

Do they actually deliver or are just another Deutsche Bank alike?
