@_date: 2018-10-22 00:02:37
Nice one. What's your btc addeess, so I can publicly act like I'm gonna tip you, but then not?

Hey yeah, I do remember a few months ago ��

Hmm, China as a currency manipulator.  Breaking news.
@_date: 2017-09-21 19:37:35
That news is 2-3 days old.  Based on the China fud with ico's spreading like fire, I highly doubt this particular fud (and with seemingly greater fudster impact than the ico news) would cause this dip.  To me, this seems like a coordinated dump.  Perhaps the Friday dumpsters thought they were getting figured out, so dumped on Thursday.

If you scroll this post super fast while looking at your phone sideways, you can see this is clearly a bullish pattern.

It would be an empty database. It would be blockchain.

Can you elaborate on that logic?
@_date: 2017-05-30 19:40:53
So in that case there are two dangers in trading alts.  The alt could drop on its own and btc rise making the alt worth even less?

DGB is there to pickup where things leave off.

Depends on UASF. May see $3101

Anyone know why I can't see upvote and downvote in this sub?

Interestingly, if kelly-ann conway turns around sideways in public 3 times we might see a slight decline. Also the moon is hungry to swallow up all the hodlers and toddlers.
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:46:17
I predict btc will hit 3k this year. yw.
@_date: 2017-06-11 21:38:58
I also predict it will hit $3050 USD.
