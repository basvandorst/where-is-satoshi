It's not the only reason. Some actors held out with upgrading waiting for the 2X part of S2X and are now forced to choose between implementing segwit, or going elsewhere.
It'd be a good idea to really keep an eye on that segwit adoption curve, and could also be healthy to get our of your echo chambers and listen to the chatter on the other side.
@_date: 2017-11-09 07:44:56
Nothing is stopping it; but it's chances of survival and to make an impact took a serious nosedive.
The code is still available,
Most miners still signal for it,
The S2X statement was "suspended", not "permanently closed",
The S2X statement hopes the community comes together and raises the blocksize without the S2X agreement in place.
What if this is just a way to tell the world that they aren't running on an agreement that some handful men can dictate one way or another, but rather that those who choose to sign the agreement actually wanted that which the agreement would deliver?

This is so far the best of the many fork images I've seen.
The only thing I think could be done better is a differnt color pre-segwitsoftfork.

If one is unable to question their own beliefs, and is unable to leave their own echo chambers and filter bubbles, then one will act on the information one has, and that information only.

half a year? I dunno, looking at the 6-month graph only shows tether-pumps and upward trends.
Those that was here for the cyprus bubble, and the gox bubble I'd give you, but half a year... **no way**.

I totally agree with you; alot of people are celebrating superficial and morally questionable things during ATH rallies.
I much rather would prefer broader adoption, but with the current bitcoin limitations (high fees, slow confirmations) it just doesn't seem feasable.
To see more of the culture that cherish adoption, you could look at the other bitcoin subreddit, That said, the price movements have gotten more than usual going there as well, which kinda sucks.
What happened to the "this is for everyone" agenda?
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:13:24
That's not quite true. We just don't want devs employed at blockstream. The rest of the open source contributors are more than welcome to take part.
Also, while I'm sure the blockstream employees would be unwelcome from the community perspective, their contribution would likely be judged on their merit like anyone elses.
@_date: 2017-11-09 07:55:04
One can also see this as the agreement is off, but all the participants are still free to choose to run whatever software they like. The signalling didin't stop with the cancellation of the agreement; the miners still signal for NYA.
If the issue with concensus was that there was an agreement in place, then removing the agreement and still managing to fork S2X would speak louder than forking while the agreement is still in place.
We will see how it plays out, but since the S2X agreement is off, some participants might now stop using segwit or attempt to revert the segwit softfork somehow.

+1, this is why I regularly leave my echo chamber and look at the many other sides and their viewpoints.
Kindof like I'm doing now. Maybe try it sometime?

I'm pretty sure you don't read much on rbtc, or that you've only read a small spectrum and happened to have a limited scope of opinions.
If you would spend a couple days and read up, you'll find that the opinon that blockstream has monopoly on developers is completely irrelevant and disregarded; after all, it's self-evident that cannot be the case when there is multiple development teams working on competing clients.
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:39:21
Might well be the case, or it might not.
If it is, and you find out for real that it's underway and all going according to plan, how will you react?
**Will you react?**

Bitcoin had value because it represented utility for a broad spectrum of actors. Today bitcoin has hit scaling issues and the scope has shifted from commerce to privacy.
I think you should ask this question in as many places as you can, and get as diverse answers as you can get - everyone has their own reasons for why bitcoin has value.
Also, another benefit of asking this in multiple channels is that you might end up breaking out echo chambers and filter bubbles and get enough information to be able to form your own well-informed opinion.
@_date: 2017-11-10 08:48:57
Sure, but you're still changing the economics of attacking the network, from requiring to out-hash your competitors to requiring to hack a single fools infrastructure.
I haven't seen that many 51% attacks lately, but I have seen a hack or two on company infrastructure.

Nah, just kidding. I like Jihan, I think he's a nice guy that just gets alot of bad rep since he's in the spotlight.

If the price goes up; look to see who benefits.
If the price goes down; look to see who benefits.
If you feel you can't find the information you seek, learn how to get out of your echo-chamber and filter bubbles so you can see the whole world.

regulated banks "clean" money as part of their process.
unregulated exchanges don't.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:24:51
Its relevance will scale with the demand for the feature. If pension funds or state-related investors go in; they will want guarantees that they don't invest in things that isn't regulated and approved.
It is much easier to get a miner that creates new untainted coins to provide the funding to these institutions, than it is for an exchange to prove the source of the funds is clean.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:56:49
Never dismiss the power of imaginare money created in a database in an exchange without a bank account. Bitfinex and their Tethers might prove to have more to do with this, than most people expect.
Just like MtGox pumped the price with willy and marcus, chances are other exchanges might engage in less than honest practices resulting in imaginary money buying up real assets.
I've heard rumours, but I haven't validated properly myself, simply because I don't use exchanges and I expect to outlive these small bumps along the road.

Why are you so certain that you speak for every single developer of the free and decentralized repo with hundreds of great minds which are rarely named?
Why do you insist on stating that none of the developers have ever thought that hardforks by miners gets to decide; when there are plenty of developers who used to work on the core repo with that opinion that have since left?
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:28:45
Happy to hear that you're making sane economic decisions. Glad you got out and didn't get stuck in a perpetual speculation cycle.
Take good care of the kid, and do teach him what money is, why it's useful to society and what happens when it isn't the people that control it.

That is quite a transformation. Regardless of all his other conduct, if these images accurately represent his physical health I got to say he managed something that quite a few others haven't.

No, it's a public github repo anyone can suggest a post to, but where the special select few that don't want bigger blocks chooses what gets in - and that's fine.

Loss aversion makes people refuse to cut their losses; which sometimes is a blessing in disguise, but in alot of times is simply the poor human condition making people miserable.

My personal opinion is irrelevant to the development of new or established clients. I personally like the idea of being able to segregate the witness data, but dislike the implementation as a contentious softfork.
With regards to the individuals themselves, most have at times proven that they are not stupid and that they have the relevant skills; though I'm much more intersted in bringing over the people that is rarely, if ever, attributed for their work.
Luke Jr has blocked me on twitter for bringing up some of his past misstakes (which he retracted and handled decently well); and I don't take well to people who choose to prevent me from taking part of data that is otherwise public or prevents me from taking part in discussions which are otherwise available to the public.
All this said though, if there is only one developer I could bring to the table, it would be Gavin, and only on the premise that he chooses what he wishes to do, in what capacity and with no other strings attached.
*I really miss Gavin*

1) It isn't.
2) People couldn't agree, so did nothing.
3) he regulary talks on letstalkbitcoin and has his own youtube channel; I'm sure you can look around on your own.

They truly believed that they had consensus at the time. Much can change in a couple of months.

The more stake you have, the stronger your internal rationalization.
Don't take advice from people who are vested in a result; take advice from people who are able to get out of their echo chambers and filter bubbles and therefor gets a more balanced and well informed view of reality.

Imagine a lightning route A &gt; B &gt; C. Have A and C be the same entity, and in their control is a paid botnet D.
A asks C for a hidden value (R), and encodes a transaction to B such that B can prove that A has the money, and that B can take the money once R is disclosed. This transaction, by the nature of the payment channels technology has a timelock of X blocks.
B then signs a transaction to C for slightly less value than the transaction from A &gt; B, with the condition that it cannot be spent unless C discloses the hidden value R.
C gets the transaction from B, tells botnet D to attack B to prevent him/her from accessing the internet, then cashes in the transaction B &gt; C.
After the timelock runs out, A closes her payment channel to the network, getting her money "back from B", then tells the botnet D that it no longer needs to block B from the internet.

What about all other customers; the regular joes? 
They sell crypto on the exchange and then want their fiat, what happens?

Yes, by being a part of the community, commenting and reporting on BIPs. My opinions was never worth discussing in the channels required for contributing.

You are definately not the only speculating on this. I've been in talks in others channel about it to and from the entire day.
You caught one thing I had missed though; the commitment device of bought S2X futures.

Institutional money wants clean money with a provable non-illegal source. Adam back tweeted a list of differential values for his vision of bitcoin a while back - all of them are related to hiding things one isn't allowed to do.
I am perfectly fine with more privacy and people doing whatever they want as long as they own up to their misstakes and take responsibility for their actions.
Institutional investors however..
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:43:05
Yes. Bitcoin that are provably not involved in illegal activities sell for a premium in some circumstances.
