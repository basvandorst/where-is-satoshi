[Benjamin Franklin, 1755](
Since those historic days of America's preparation for Independence, the overwhelming vast majority of the populace have indeed been indoctrinated and conditioned to believe in trading safety/security for some of their basic rights, because they are quite simply terrified of doing otherwise, so they won't stand against this compromising of encryption technology.
The next logical step after that would be for this technology to be regulated and licensed (read: outlawed for you and I).
Everyone please download old versions of open source software for encryption of system/hard drive, file, email, and data... before they are no longer available in their secure forms. Software like Truecrypt, GPG, Tails, Tor, I2P, and the like. Make multiple copies too.

Humans can't be trusted, but open source algorithms can be trusted and updated if and when broken.
A good guy today can turn bad or be compromised tomorrow.
That's all you need to consider.

Compare what people say to what they do. Humans often lie, but their actions do not.

They are telling everyone that, if you do similarly, the same thing will happen to you, regardless of any illegalities or lawsuits down the road, because none of them will do jail time and any judgements will be paid for by the taxpayer anyways (e.g. they have nothing to lose, and until they have something to lose, things will keep getting worse).
