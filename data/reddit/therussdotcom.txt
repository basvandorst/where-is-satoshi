While I will def check these out, I'll take the opportunity to reccomend both of his books on "The Internet of Money". I own both as hard copies, bought some for friends and recommend Andreas to people when my own explanations fail to impress the listener (or myself!). I've tried listening to Buterin, Poon and others and find that the angles Antonopoulos covers are exactly in tune with my worldview, and where I see the protocol and network going in the future. He's also on Patreon which is an awesome way to support people who's work you find useful or inspiring.

Sorry for OT reply, but OOI, what daily transactions are you making using crypto? Which services, markets etc accept crypto such that you can transact daily? Cheers.

A fork means that one thing splits into more than one thing. Nowhere in any definition of fork in a technical context that I have seen is it implied or suggested that the original thing ceases to exist. If I fork a codebase via github for example, that codebase doesn't stop existing merely because it was forked.

As I understand it, Antonopoulos has been paid in BTC for all his speaking gigs for the last few years. How he manages that as part of being self employed, is another question.

Couldn't have said it better myself.

I genuinely don't understand the "centralisation" by (bank, commercial enty etc) issue wr/t LN. The transacted data is encrypted. Neither party can run off with funds given how the contracts are built. What do folks think there actually is to control by those that run hubs? Overcharging for use of their channels and connections perhaps?
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:34:53
The issue with centralisation is not centralisation in and of itself, but the effect of centralisation in a given context.
Centralisation of standard Fiat transactions is bad not because of centralisation per se, but because of what happens to that data in the centralised organisation such as price and data manipulation. This is why I asked; what are folks afraid will happen exactly to tx's routed thru LN hubs. It's not as if those that run the hubs have any more insight into the encrypted data, than someone running a bunch of nodes in their bedroom.

+100 For Andreas. I still find videos I've never seen, and others I have and both times I will learn something new.

Precisely. Much of the point of LN is long running, obviously "pre filled" channels, between for example users and a service they engage with regularly like a local store, local council or even the tax dept. Those channels need not be constantly open and closed. Full credit to OP for the question and others for doing some math.

No sign of going up. What exactly does such a sign look like? When you find out, please let us all into the secret :-)

Oh absolutely it will only be a subset. But who's to say Bitcoin is of the same ilk as pets.com or Altavista, and in fact those comparative failures in crypto haven't already failed ala egold, ecash, digigold and others.

Nice response. Recall though that there are now thousands of coins and tokens, and to think there may be a single dominant one is to miss an important point: That markets comprising only 2 friends or millions of punters emerge where each market (network) uses a different coin for transacting just between those users on those networks.
Imagine wallets _invisibly_ supporting LN and AS such that inter network transactions and conversions are performed under the hood. Wallet users need not care that a good or service is priced in ETH and all they have is BTC to pay with. 
Please don't fall into the trap of "one global coin" belief. It's almost as erroneous as "This technology is bunkem and will never go anywhere".

+1 for use of "fluffing your cock"
