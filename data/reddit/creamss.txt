Because that would lead to bitcoin being less decentralized.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:51:09
Have you checked so you are on the correct chain?
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:24:41
Well, sorry for your struggle but my experience is that it says on the invoice page that its paid as soon as youve pressed paid on whatever wallet you're using.
It might also be that your wallet could have a delay in it for some reason... so that a transaction isnt added to the blockchain straight away after pressing send.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:18:55
Bitpay dont require a confirmation within those 15 min, only for the transaction to be added to the blockchain.
I ordered 2 ledgers 2 days ago and paid with bitcoin without any issues...
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:07:19
So what?
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:51:59
Yeah, what i meant its aight

@_date: 2017-08-27 10:03:34

Yes, because its not the same wallet.dat file

To an extent, although linux based systems may be less vulnerable if you have downloaded something skecthy as of late you could be at risk otherwise not.
and about ppl losing their assets is because of either downloading an unofficial version ( this is the official or because of them having malware but i think downloading an unofficial version is the more common reason

@_date: 2017-11-05 17:34:44


All coins of a cryptocurrency are always on their specific blockchain. What i mean is to not have crypto sitting in krakens own BTC addresses or whatever crypto you may be dealing with as they are more vulnerable to being hacked.
To clarify with what i said 


To NOT have BTC sitting in krakens OWN addresses long term as they are MORE vulnerable to being hacked compared to YOUR OWN Electrum wallet.
Also, if you decide to invest serious money i suggest you to buy a hardware wallet such as a Trezor ( or a Ledger ( and DO NOT order one off of ebay or any other third party website beside Amazon.
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:06:45


You split the coins yourself with your private key
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:04:53
I dont think its possible.

Its only to create an account on some exchange and lie about your age. most exchanges only require you to fill in DOB and full name to trade between cryptocurrencies and no ID so theres no way of them knowing your real age, dob ect.

Yes, although they do take their time they do deliver. Bitmain is a legit company.
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:37:25
Yes, move them to either Bitcoin core or Electrum and make sure to encrypt them with a STRONG password. Also, do some viruscheck with malwarebytes or something before doing it even thought it might not help much.

@_date: 2017-11-08 00:13:41
Segwit2x would change the size of the blocks passed regularly around the network and stored in the blockchain from 1 MB to 2 MB.
Its also an attempt to try and make bitcoin more centralized which most people dont want which will cause segshit2x to fail either way.
Edit: You could see this as a "reward" but whatever BTC ppl are holding during and after fork will be getting the same amount of S2X which many ppl will dump anyway and prob buy more BTC

@_date: 2017-11-16 02:06:02


hmm, thats weird since you were able to send a bigger amount, mustve been something you did wrong on ur end.


Should be confirmed in around 15 mins, most likely sooner
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:10:10
The age of that video might be relevant...
Also, purse.io might not recognize your tx as its not the amount you were asked to send

Not quite sure what you mean, do you mean that the transaction is yet to be confirmed and that the estimated amount of blocks for it to get confirmed is 230 blocks?

Also traded around $500 worth of Zcash to Bitcoin without any issues
Just dont "store" any crypto on any exchange and you'll be safe, also make sure to activate 2FA and have a strong password.

@_date: 2017-09-11 15:37:30
I dont have a clue tbh, i dont have much knowledge of the technical side of bitcoin. But i guess you could try and just boost it with confirmtx if it dont end up confirming.
@_date: 2018-03-02 15:23:51
cryptobridge aswell
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:12:11
So you dont have a txid?
Either way, if you are sure that you sent your BTC to the correct address it should pop up on your trezor within 10 min.
@_date: 2017-09-09 21:34:11
You're better off buying used GPUs off of ebay and mining alts like zcash or monero

I do, but i know nowhere near as good german as i do english
@_date: 2017-09-11 17:36:26
If you transfer your bitcoin(s) to a private wallet there wont be any issues. 
I'd recommend Electrum  , create a standard wallet and send your bitcoins to that address. Make sure to setup a strong and long password. And to write down your seed (12 word phrase) and store them in a safe place written down on a paper.
@_date: 2017-09-10 12:51:38
No one cares.
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:21:13
+1 
Don't worry OP, it will just take longer for the transaction to get mined into a block.

@_date: 2017-09-09 15:08:55


But will it even go through then?
@_date: 2017-10-15 20:14:17
Continue HODLING!!
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:21:03
to 0 but i obviously wouldnt recommend that lol.
Whenever i want to send a tx i just follow  to see how low i can go. As you can see from looking at it, the lowest people are sending at is currently 0.0002 so thats what fee i would go with unless i need the transaction to go through fast.
@_date: 2017-09-11 18:16:55
Are you typing in the country code? such as +44?
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:29:16
A private key is like a key to your public address meaning that you anyone with your private key can sweep your address and steal your btc.
Furthermore, i dont know anything about the wallet you're using but if you have a seed (word phrase) id recommend you to import that phrase into a wallet that supports exporting of private keys such as electrum.
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:37:32
When you've done that, export the private key from your current address which the btc was located at the time of the fork. save it somewhere for later.
Then make a completly new wallet, once again, id recommend using electrum. Some may argue of it not being safe but aslong as you dont got any viruses/malware on your pc you should be good. Its just that electrum has so many useful features.
Send your btc from your old address to the new address on the new wallet you created which now will be your new wallet (this is for security purposes bcus you will be exposing your private key to your old address to a bitcoin cash wallet)
When thats done take the private key belonging to your old address and import into a bitcoin cash wallet ( bcc wallets can be found on their website) and the bcc should be there. Done!
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:36:28
You need move your btc to a fucking wallet where you control your fucking private keys if you want the fucking bitcoin gold. 
I wouldnt recommend you leaving it in a fucking webbased wallet during a fucking fork either.
@_date: 2017-09-09 17:06:34
Thanks for the info, ive decided to use Electrum since it seems like you dont get your private key with GA.
@_date: 2017-09-11 20:09:10

Hope it wasn't too big amount you potentially lost.

@_date: 2017-10-29 19:15:01
No, you do not.
Just copy/paste the address that has been generated in bitcoin core into whatever pool you're using.
Just make sure you DO download the whole blockchain or your funds won't appear in your wallet unless you choose to use Electrum which you dont need to download the whole blockchain for.  
If you want to do that, you can just open the wallet.dat in Electrum.
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:20:13

Yes. From the Receive Money tab in our wallet applications, enter your private key and the coins will be swept into your wallet.
This is the only thing i found from their FAQ, so im guessing they don't have that feature. Huh, might use Electrum instead.
@_date: 2017-10-16 22:41:51
Oh, the official program is called Bitcoin core and can be downloaded from the official bitcoin website but around 120 gb is required to use bitcoin core because of you having to download the whole blockchain.
If you dont want to be downloading 120 gb then id recommend Electrum,  
I'd also recommend you reading through this 
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:03:00
Mining bitcoin requires specialized ASICS aka specialized hardware made for mining bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-10-24 15:19:18
Do not use blockchain.info as your wallet unless you want to get hacked and your btc stolen.
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:16:16
electrum running on tailsOS unless you are not planning on buying a hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:00:43
Sorry but this is beyond autistic.
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:21:47
Ok then. Read the post above.
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:53:31
Yeah good job,
Bitcoin gold dont even exist yet.
You got scammed.
@_date: 2017-10-29 14:44:29
Please DO NOT store your BTC on Blockchain.info
Too many horror stories of people losing their assets on there no matter if they had 2FA or not.
I'd recommend Electrum on TailsOS since hardware wallet isn't an option
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:22:03
I'd recommend you to use localbitcoins.com, the exchange rates aren't the best but guess thats what's left.
@_date: 2017-09-11 18:08:31
No, dont

Should i just send all my BTC as a normal transaction paying 8 bucks for the transaction?, Ouch!

@_date: 2017-10-19 22:16:31
It isn't legit.
@_date: 2017-10-16 21:01:07
No, not how it works.
You need to have a fee set for the transaction to even go through. 
Moreover, the fee is used for miners to be able to integrate the transaction into a block so it can go through, since miners prioritize transactions with the highest fee a transaction with no fee will probably never or get confirmed within a long time.

Read the guidelines next time.
@_date: 2018-07-18 20:40:00
either all or some of the cryptos they support combined in one stock making it an index.
@_date: 2017-07-12 14:42:58
Agreed, 35 bucks for a t shirt is wayyyy too much.
@_date: 2017-07-07 15:03:45
Why the hell are you posting this in a bitcoin subreddit?
No one cares.
@_date: 2017-06-17 18:20:46
+1 Respect
Completely agree.
@_date: 2017-06-20 17:30:39
Probably bcus the amount you are trying to send is less than what the fees cost.
@_date: 2017-06-17 18:17:47
This is as basic as you can fkn get.
Go to control panel.
"uninstall a program"
search for bitcoin core and uninstall.
lol.... why did i even give you instructions.
@_date: 2017-06-28 23:17:38
So then whats the reason for them implementing this if they will never catch anyone?
There is no way they can enforce this since people wont be carrying anything related to digital currencies with them.
And they probably would care since i would be using the currency in the US
@_date: 2017-06-28 21:02:40
How are the customs going to find out if someone has digital currencies or not?
@_date: 2017-06-17 18:14:56
1 mb or something below 10 mb for sure.
the reason bitcoin core is 60 gb or whatever it is is because you download the whole blockchain.

Thank you, i live in the EU so hopefully this site will work out for me.
@_date: 2017-06-28 23:37:07
Thank you for being thorough.
Much appreciated!
I didnt know that the congressman had no idea how bitcoins worked which pretty much explains it all.
@_date: 2017-06-28 23:22:29
No, its still being discussed i think
@_date: 2017-06-06 08:49:05
Thank you for the suggestion, i'll stick to kraken for now and in the future i might start using other sites.
