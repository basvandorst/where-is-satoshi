Prolly stupid question, if i transfer back to fiat i still pay fees right? But its cheaper to buy on Gdax right? (only did coinbase so far fyi)

Depends how your current situation your in. Some people consider life changing on a whole other level. Somebody who can't put alot of money into bitcoin atm can have their life changed because they can buy extra stuff with the profit for kids, or pay the rent easy. If u want easy life change u should be there at the start. Doesn't mean bitcoin is their yet it will change life in general when we kick off like its supossed to be.

Got XRP before the madness started but it will def hit coinbase only 5min walk from coinbase headquarters and a good coin. It won't go up insane because that isn't what xrp stands for. Still good gains though

The only thing i know about CNBC etc as an european is that it's fake news! hahah
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:12:23
No idea where i see that, but i just see that theirs a service error in coinbase. Sending BTC from coinbase, maybe thats why its delayed lets hope so
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:19:36
Mmm i still feel so dumb in trading. My thought process was to buy now some BCH because when it opens on GDAX / Coinbase again its gonna increase even more. I didn't do it yet but was thinking about it...
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:01:03
Whatever dude its a typo just kinda worried please
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:05:03
Thats a bit of a relief, i quadro checked everything still thought it was wrong or whatsoever
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:10:23
I understand i had problems receiving bitcoins some hours ago because of that. Maybe thats the case i don't know its kinda far behind atm and it still moves couple of % up each minute.

1300% in one year, 20% in a week. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:33:19
i mean comparing any crypto vs bitcoin is pretty stupid so i agree with u sir. But its nice to see this crazyness for XRP before it even hitted Coinbase. Atleast if u have a stake in it
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:23:28
no idea i bought 5hours ago at the peak, and i made 50eur profit. Weird times, just buy when u have extra money to spent on it. This thing is going crazy in the last 24h, 25% almost again. it will be 20k before the next year if it goes like this.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:31:18
Bitcoin had a little bit of media this month and the prices skyrocket. This is just the beginning, 20k should be an easy target if we look at how we stand right now. 50k will be harder to overcome because we will see alot of selling. But once onlineshops/offlineshops will accept bitcoin, more talk about it 100k doesn't seem to far fetched
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:04:26
Ouch thanks second time i do this. And when i checked the BTC Adress again it changed and i was like "i send my BTC to some random guy" lets hope it all goes right.

Better a rookie then 0.000BTC i would say! Spreading the word bit by bit(coin)
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:55:23
Yep ofcourse!
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:26:00
Bought at a peak 12k eur some hours ago and i'm making profit every minute. Its so unpredictable that i don't even wait for dips anymore
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:36:00
Depends how u value your fiat currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:19:41
Now i see it the received bitcoin with a date/time. So i'm fine now! Was a bit worried. Now i see it on coinbase. Takes now some time to complete it
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:22:54
LOL They actually call him "Bitcoin jesus" ...

@_date: 2017-08-29 22:18:23
i'm expecting nothing. But gold to paper was weird. This is also weird but the charts doesn't lie. And we don't know where it will end. So i keep investing money i don't need or not afraid to lose.
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:39:08
my former employee 3 years ago told me about it. it was arround 500dollars now when i saw this i was like i need to get on it now!
