They don't but they are going to legislate it anyway. Why? Because people can use it without having to assess, or pay taxes on the transaction, and California NEEDS to tax your every breath, or the entire edifice of their economy will collapse. 
Either way, all this legislation will do is create a bunch of new criminals, and force innovation out of California.... Too bad, so sad. Should have been happy with income taxes, but no....you had to try to steal it all.

State the date of your ICO, and get funded by banks.

I think it's a bunch of fear-mongering

So because the Federal Reserve hasn't completely robbed us in your lifetime, they are wonderful? The Federal Reserve Note (not a government currency btw...it is issued by the FED) has lost over 97% of it's value since it was invented.

Find a currency that does not fluctuate in value, and I will show you a currency that has never been in circulation.

Just like video games have pushed screen resolution, frame-rate, and the development of faster, cooler-running video cards, I expect Bitcoin mining to push the envelope of CPU processing speeds. I also expect a break-through such as this one to push bigger chip makers into the mining space...

Yeah, you have to go 3 or 6... Otherwise your recital ends up in between the monitors.

That doesn't make any sense. At least in terms of Bitcoin. No country government or company is responsible for making Bitcoin. Therefore to impose the rule of a state, government, or company on the space is violating NO CONTRACT, because the creators and devs behind BTC don't impose or presume to impose any such CONTRACT on participants of the space. If there ever were such a contract over us attempted, I am certain that we would simply change the coin we are mining , point our miners at another pool, and start mining a coin whose devs are not as presumptuous and domineering.

It's all about OPM baby!

You really can't blame us. Just take a look at TV, or Radio, or Telephones,  and to some extent the internet. All of these started off as free and libertarian as Bitcoin has. As such, it is only natural that because the same forces that have sought and achieved control (to some extent) over these inventions are now besetting the door of the Bitcoin community, that the members of that community are concerned that these forces will seize Bitcoin from us. I don't care about the idiocy of thinking it can be done. All they have to do really is convince a significant portion of us that they can, and should regulate the cryptoshpere, and some wonder-butt dev will work to make it a reality.

They can make commits all day long, and it will not effect the miners one bit. The only way it effects the miners is if they IMPLEMENT the changed version.

I don't think anything is wrong with leaving Bitcoin as it is. The market will find ways to deal with issues Bitcoin cannot solve. Like High Frequency trading on-chain. BTC can't do it, but maybe someone can make a cryptocurrency that can. That is one of the great things about Bitcoin being open source. Because it is OS, if someone monkeys it too hard, we can go back an iteration or two, fix the bug that let the bad thing happen, and then move forward. Because there are multiple implementations going on at once, we can see where/what/why the bad thing happened. 
This is why arbitrary implementation of Hard Forks in Bitcoin is such a stupid venture. We have no idea how these implementations will actually work in the real world, so every major change risks harming too many people's funds to just "do". I've said on multiple occasions (and probably will a million times more before people actually start doing it) that the way to get around this problem is to release them as altcoins. Then we can see how they work, and whether or not they solve the problem without risking people's money, or irreparably disrupting Bitcoin.

..and they are hoping you are stupid enough to listen to them

How would that work? USDs are IOUs written by a private bank. If they were valued in negative USDs you would make money ;-)

If jail didn't help, maybe they need some Federal Prison. Some good ol PMITA Federal Prison..

I agree in principle. I think that if people do not do their homework, they deserve to lose their money. However, there is a point you reach when it becomes obvious that their ONLY intent is to defraud the public. In which case I see no reason to treat them with any wit of civility. Not saying "the man" has to get involved, but short of that, what other recourse do we have (other than simply refusing to do business with them)?

People like to gamble. "Will I get out with glorious profits, or be a doomed twat on the sidewalk?" Might as well be playing Blackjack in Vegas. The house always wins in the end.

I don't want SegWit. The majority of the miners don't want segwit, and trying to force it on the network will only have bad effects for everyone. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 19:05:57
When you say destroy, are you talking about adding SegWit and eventually the need for a second tier of miners (LN nodes)? And when you say "small changes" are you talking about making the blocks 2mb, 4mb. or 8mb instead of 1mb without the SegWit bullshit bundled in?
@_date: 2015-11-01 20:32:21
Yep... And then their hot-wallet gets hit, and they go back to using cold storage due to public outcry.
@_date: 2017-07-04 19:01:30
How about the majority of the network wants to run Bitcoin on the network, and you are trying to replace it with Ripple? How many other miners have to disagree with you for you to understand that the NETWORK DOESN'T WANT IT? Had you ever considered the possibility that seeing as it is THEIR hardware, and THEIR electricity, that maybe THEY are the best people to determine what they do with it? If not, what makes you so special that you should be able to dictate to them what BIPs to support, or version of the code to run? 
Also, it is entirely within your power CURRENTLY to fire up as many miners as you can afford, and support whatever BIPs you want on YOUR hardware. There is NOTHING stopping you.
