I like to compare the “illicit crypto use” argument to the “what if a self driving car kills someone” argument.
People are always dying left and right from auto accidents.  A good system of self driving cars would lower those numbers by a ridiculous amount, yet people will freak out when one or two people die in a self driving car accident.
Like what do they think drug dealers and buyers make transactions with now?  Animal crackers?  Lol, they use fucking cash, which is a lot less traceable compared to bitcoin.

You wouldn’t be able to get on a single exchange that is working properly.  You would have to wait weeks just for one transaction to process.  Bad things basically.

This community confuses the fuck out of people.  Half the time they talk about how it’s the new gold and how you should accumulate as much as possible, but the other half of the time they talk about how you should spend Bitcoin.

Trump is probably bullish on Bitcoin, and just trying to drive the price down so he can buy more of it.

Do something?  It has been doing something.  You don’t want it to go up $1,000 every other day, trust me.  Organic steady growth over time is what is best for bitcoin.  Insane volatility just scares people away.

Being unable to spend your own money whenever you want is more than an inconvenience.  Fucking transfers shouldn’t take multiple days.  Why is it that I’m able to transfer money INSTANTLY from my PayPal account to my debit/checking account (as long as I pay a fee of course)?

Except you are supposed to want bitcoin, not piles of fiat.  A real believer wouldn’t cash out for fiat; a real believer you are not.

Transferwise.com  will save you a lot of money if you have to do a wire transfer with your bank.  I was skeptical at first, but it’s a legit service that does transfers in only a few hours.  It also costs a lot less than what your bank will charge you.

You forgot to mention that it’s highly volatile, has security issues (especially for new users), and has a scalability issue (a MASSIVE ONE).
I am a big fan of Bitcoin, but let’s not pretend that it’s perfect in every way.

Same as my old BitPay Card.  Can you withdraw cash with this?  Available in NY, US?  
Fucking BitPay no longer allows atm withdrawal, so it’s a fucking piece of shit now.  And fees, fuck BitPay.

I recommend that you just buy on a schedule rather than chasing prices.  Cost averaging, for example, you could buy $200 worth of Bitcoin every Sunday, no matter what the price is at.  This has worked well for many people (myself included).  
Just don’t spend money that you cannot afford to lose, and do not panic sell or try day trading.  Just buy a set amount every week, two weeks, or month, and hold on to it for a year minimum.  This is a winning combo if you follow all the rules.

I have a petty good understanding of money, but I’m far from being an economic expert.  Yes, people hoarding assets of a developing money system prior to adoption is a problem, but I don’t claim to know how to prevent or solve it.  Instead of the banks or the Fed controlling markets/volatility, a handful of mega rich whales will.  It’s not ideal, but still soooooo much better than our current situation with banks controlling everything.  Over time the existing bitcoin should disperse somewhat evenly into the population, but it would take a while.
It’s a shame that we cant do something like distribute a new currency at a 1:1 ratio matching the exact amount of USD that each person has to replace fiat (it’s an extreme example but it would give people control over their money and be distributed to match and replace funds that people have now).  There will always be people who try to get ahead of the curve and make as much as possible when a new system is being implemented, but when a ton of people do it impedes mass adoption.  Just look at the current market; folks who have massive amounts of bitcoin can cause havoc by selling large amounts at once, which scares the shit out of many people and causes them to stay away from crypto.
There is no perfect solution.  Bitcoin is the best there is right now, but we aren’t even close to beginning to see mass adoption.  I don’t want to sound like a pessimist or something, but I fear that mass adoption without centralization in some form or another might be impossible.  It would probably take some sort of massive revolution/economic collapse, because those who hold the power will do anything to keep it and currently are unbeatable.  They also gain more and more control as time goes on.  It’s going to be incredibly difficult for people to break free from the chains that are controlled by the banking and governing elite, but will be incredibly worth the struggle.

What the fuck is going on!?  This shit is nuts!  Seriously though, anyone have any ideas as to why it’s climbing so fast?  Possible dump soon?  
I don’t move anything of mine, I haven’t since early 2017.   It feels good to see the price rising, especially after sticking through the rough days and abstaining from selling.  Congrats to those who held through the storm!  Hopefully we stay in the green.  This crazy price movement kinda scares me, I’d like for things to slow down a bit.
@_date: 2019-06-30 21:07:23
I don’t know the answer, but if I did I would be devoting my life to implementing it.  The point of my post was to get people focused back on the true purpose of bitcoin and why Satoshi created it in the first place rather than price movements and bullshit drama that is fueled by Vermin and Sir Criesalot.  Like I said, I always viewed myself as someone who believed in bitcoin, the crypto revolution, and the necessity of having financial freedom from the banking elites, but just realized that was only true to a certain degree.  But today I crossed a line, and those things have become 1000x more clear to me.

Good for you man; whatever works best for you is what you should be doing.
I’m having a great week; I am also invested in an alt that I’ve been buying for years (50/50 with BTC).  That alt has gone up ~100% in just a couple of weeks, so I hope it continues to do well along with BTC.

Because that’s what happens when people want to take profits, especially when those people are whales and make big/calculated moves.
@_date: 2019-06-30 21:14:39
How can I blame them for not accepting crypto?  It’s a smaller company that produces high quality hand made niche products.  They are still growing, so they might not be making huge profits.  With the current volatility of existing crypto markets (and the amount of scams, hacks, etc...) they would be putting their entire company at risk by accepting it.  Also, there are laws in place in Europe which say that only specific payment methods are allowed for pre ordering items that will take more than 30 days to get to the buyer.  
They aren’t to blame whatsoever.

Best part about having a cold storage wallet is that you can setup a “fake” address in it.  That way, if you are ever in a situation like the one depicted in this poorly drawn cartoon, you give the decoy address to the gunman and protect your real funds.  They might still kill you for pissing them off, but at least your coin will be safe.  
Unless it’s BCash.  Just give it to them if that’s what you have.
