Okay thanks for the info Coinapault stake holder troll person
@_date: 2016-04-01 17:06:14
Okay so the dude is not suing Andreas and was trolled. Surely he know who Andreas is, someone is trying to troll this dude hard. It happens all the time in the Bitcoin space, threatening companies get attacked. Be open minded, if you don't like the service don't use it, but attacking it does nothing it just creates animosity and distracts from the goal of bitcoin growing and becoming more widely accepted so that the people have a choice against corportate controlled payments if we like. :)

coinapault people are probably the one who started the rumor to begin with lol. SMH

Anyone else’s shares not reflecting the split yet? I’ve been a long time holder so I’m a bit nervous why the price is reflecting but not new shade ratio ;(
@_date: 2014-06-22 07:41:30
Nice, that's cool there was a whole segment on how to speak to reporters! Hugely needed still so often is translation to layman's terms! For new interested folk too.. Great recap! 
@_date: 2014-09-30 17:07:39
No kidding! I live in Long Beach too! Anything happening down here ever with meet ups do you know?
@_date: 2014-10-22 17:56:54
Not open source yet. hmmm mintpal was open source, if you think you're safe from attack or corruption just because something is open source than you may want to re-evaluate this belief and false blanket of security...  :)

THanks cool and will do, I think I saw that on meet-ups but I was out of state and I was super bummed. Thanks much
@_date: 2014-11-22 21:05:08
Yeesh U.M. is this your crypto contribution?! Kinda weird...
@_date: 2014-09-14 22:36:02
thanks a lot man :)
@_date: 2014-09-15 15:36:13
Very disruptive, I think there's some good stuff in here to help take aim at the problem of Media-bias based on ownership. Disrupt FOX news.. I like
@_date: 2014-07-22 23:20:44
CoinDesk is for hire, they are a joke and they should be held accountable for their BS. Look at how many back links they do over and over of the same companies.. Wake up
@_date: 2014-07-22 23:15:49
By the way, have you ever seen how many back-links they blast of the same companies.. A few our vapor-ware.. Get real man..
@_date: 2014-11-23 20:29:30
Oh there's no limit at all. Joint accounts, multi-party accounts, can be 2 of 2, 3 of 3, 12 of 12 (jury lol) ;)
@_date: 2014-07-21 06:38:11
Started noticing bot posts on twitter, suspicious girl profiles and others, I kept seeing one theme on the coin desk posts some were retweeting.. I'll leave the rest up to imagination or for people to connect their own dots. 
Besides that though, great point, there are a ton of other news sources. Thankfully
@_date: 2014-11-23 00:33:14
lol ok!
@_date: 2014-10-01 15:44:31
630pm by the way  :)
@_date: 2014-11-21 06:23:03
@_date: 2014-06-03 15:41:35
Haha let me rephrase, sounds like you missed the boat on Drk?
@_date: 2014-09-13 07:05:55
BitHalo new release is slick, it should be on here... Only that counterparts and ripple should be mentioned the rest vaporware
@_date: 2014-10-09 16:58:57
@_date: 2014-10-09 16:59:22
Awesome thanks!
@_date: 2014-09-27 16:33:58
Very cool  :)
@_date: 2014-10-17 16:13:01
Haha is Open Transactions even released yet?! 
@_date: 2014-10-09 16:57:49
Absolutely legit, the source code will be available when out of Beta so they have a head start on the forkers... Check out all the blackcoin on Dogecoin community feedback they swear by it.
@_date: 2014-07-22 23:14:51
They're ridiculous.. It's so frustrating because I got in crypto to avoid shit like this. Hopefully people will start to see this more and more.. 
@_date: 2014-10-10 21:15:12
Like backing kinda?

So this Tuesday we had scheduled our meet up at 6pm. Looks like the main LA bitcoin group scheduled one at the exact same time. I almost feel like they did it on purpose but maybe I'm just cynical. Gonna be on BitHalo and smart contracts mostly. Would love to talk about stuff like Tether and some other new projects. Maybe some Dogecoin/paypal stuff? Would you be into coming? It'd be in Santa Monica at cacao coffee shop.. :) 
@_date: 2014-11-21 05:42:30
Haha doa BitHalo double-deposit smart contract!!!
@_date: 2014-10-12 02:51:46
I'll give you a ride if you're down :) 310-270-2528 text me

It's just double deposit escrow, assurance in trading and exchanging. :) Not trying to solve everything at all. Contracting has a wide breadth in general. It's not limited to any type per say, however they are focusing on trade and exchange. Specifically international trade/bartering and than OTC crypto currency exchanging. :)
@_date: 2014-11-21 05:34:05
Use BitHalo probably is best
@_date: 2014-06-03 15:34:53
Sounds like you're heavy vested in BitCoin... Just sayin
@_date: 2014-10-17 16:16:51
But yes you can trade anything :)
@_date: 2014-10-22 18:02:26
Code's open to audit at all times :) actually I know the plan to have Peter Todd or someone he recommended recently in Vegas to audit is in works. Team is boot strapping bear in mind.  
@_date: 2014-11-23 17:36:06
Sounds a bit susceptible to collusion or malleability :/
@_date: 2014-07-23 18:53:37
This is really good article, I hope people read and share! Thx alexfrank1
@_date: 2014-09-30 17:09:05
Yeah LA is big, so more are wanted. Plus one is dev only and the other not even posted on Meet ups
@_date: 2014-11-21 18:31:19
Doesn't BitHalo skip all that? I think utilizing the free hand and Nash equilibrium is simple enough to work for all the above. Ethereum lacks a true enforcement protocol. It's also highly subjective to malleability :/
@_date: 2014-11-23 17:42:55
That's basically Ethereum in a nut shell.. Thing is though, is that it's highly susceptible to malleability with the funding process. The other issue is enforcement.. So yes the contract gets funded, but who enforces the action or repayment or maybe the calling of bond, see? Say I get that in that simul-funding, what enforces the bond issuer to pay me my cut.. Have you looked at BitHalo? I think all these platforms eventually will circle back and look at double-deposit escrow as the only true way to enforce contracts on all ends.. All parties share in risk and all parties share in the benefits of properly executed transactions/contracts.. Just my pov thus far on that whole space :)
@_date: 2015-01-29 17:40:58
BitHalo already does that. Is there a mention?
@_date: 2015-04-02 17:03:00
All wallets communicate with eachother using bit-message, they have a fix for bitmessage but I don't fully understand it  :)
@_date: 2015-04-02 17:01:51
Well there is no central server so it's hard to say . I know a community member was working on a parser but I think even then it wont be laser accurate  :)
