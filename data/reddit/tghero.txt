People take pride in coins like they do sports teams, it's hilarious. Just another fanboy of one of them. Lots of coins have new takes on things and it's all good for the crypto world. People like BigMoneyBro make me lol.

I'm sure there was zero BTC exchanged for the statements of support for his BFF. Yup, zero BTC. /s

Hypocrisy can be difficult to see in yourself. A lot of (fellow) bitcoiners have trouble with that.

Yay happy ending!
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:58:22
It still makes me laugh!

Mine was supposed to come in around 5 hours ago as well. Nothing.
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:46:08
Really good advice here.
@_date: 2013-04-18 02:25:54
Why can't there be a running thread in the sidebar that lists companies that are accepting them?

The tipbot is overloaded because of so many people tipping! It'll come through soon. =)
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:20:02
Is that tip real life?!?

I hear helping family and friends and random redditors is the beginning of true happiness.

Still pending...
Edit: Sent in a support ticket this morning and they promptly resolved the issue, saying my transaction got stuck - I'm assuming related to the ddos yesterday. I was pleased with the quick response by support and have my coin in hand.

You need to have some crypto fun, here.

Holy smokes. Just bought BTC yesterday on the site flawlessly. Hopefully everything gets resolved for those of you with funds tied up there.
@_date: 2013-11-01 19:42:07
I had the same problem. Wrote support this morning and they said they just applied some system update that left my order pending. Coins were in my account right after they wrote me back.
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:10:31
You the man now dog.

I actually used it the other day with Moneygram. The money was in my wallet before I got home. Not bad.

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.
