Does anyone actually use it though?

So I directed this year's opening keynote video for Google I/O and dropped a BTC easter egg in it.  See if you can spot it.
Video (with the dot) starts here:

Well I can assure you that it was not accidental.  
@_date: 2014-07-11 21:21:43
isn't this more like fund their legal defense with btc?
@_date: 2014-07-11 21:22:01
they can.  just don't sign with a label.

I'm just a creative director at a small little creative shop that produces a lot of video content for Google.  They're a client of ours.
The BTC thing was just a small personal nod from me to the community.  Sorry nothing more than that!

I thought bitcoin and crypto in general is suppose to be a currency not an investment...

I thought you can only trade on Robinhood.

How exactly have you "paid your dues"?

Yeah i know it's fun and easy to jab at Mark but seriously, did you never ever say or do stupid shit when you were in college?  He literally said this 15+yrs ago.

No one would ever care to remember if we did.
@_date: 2015-07-09 13:21:10
Ok Google.

That’s the thing I don’t get.  The example in this video is very clunky compared to using a credit card.
@_date: 2019-04-03 17:38:30
Uhm it’s literally what this comment thread is about
@_date: 2019-04-29 01:19:51
Yo be honest this is much much slower and cumbersome than using a credit card...

He owns more than 10% in a lot of companies.  He could never dump everything at once.
@_date: 2015-07-31 21:54:02
Didn't have to.

Why are they unspendable?
@_date: 2019-05-02 22:41:13
That’s the whole point of editing.  It’s not just trimming clips.
@_date: 2019-05-02 19:40:33
And horribly edited.
