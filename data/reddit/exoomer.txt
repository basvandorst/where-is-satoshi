I wasn't commenting solely on OP, my second comment is explaining it :&gt;

It's pretty funny how everyone here tries to convince the chat operator to accept Bitcoin, as if he had any possibility to do so.

So all points are your subjective views on two symbols. Good.

Again, I take that, I'm not attacking OP, plz read second comment for explanation :)

If I really think that I'm smarter than the company, I'll just send them an e-mail. Not going to chat with an operator, where the chance of the idea getting to the right people is almost 0% and then post a screenshot on the internet showing that the operator wasn't really caring about BTC. Also, if you're a company, you have groups (like marketing, or PR, or IT) who do follow these kind of things, and they do not apply everything for a reason. It just seems really childish to me. The basic point is nice - let them know about BTC, but when I see every week 2 or 3 screens like this from some online web chats complaining about BTC payments... just seems that it isn't the right way to do it. Take also in mind that BTC is not widespread and is still starting, so if you believe in it doesn't mean that every company/business should accept it.

Im not against that, it's just that in most of these screenshots the pro-btc customer is kinda angry at the chat operator, saying bullshit like "Oh, then I won't be your customer anymore...". Why would a chat operator give a damn if one guy is angry on chat over some BTC payments? It should be proposed as an option, not being aggressive, because someone doesn't accept BTC.

Well, paying with a credit card, you just write down 19 numbers and the expiration date, it isn't that hardcore neither. Usually takes less then 30 sec to pay for anything.
