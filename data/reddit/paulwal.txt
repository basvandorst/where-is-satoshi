Just as a thought experiment, let's say this is the brilliant Satoshi Nakamoto, creator of bitcoin.
The Newsweek article is posted at 6:00 am on on March 6th. Leah probably spent all day on the 5th writing this article; maybe even two days. This means her encounters with Mr. Nakamoto were on the 4th or prior to the 4th.
Satoshi, being the genius he is, knows this reporter is on to him and is going to release the story. So he *immediately* begins evasive maneuvers, in the form of disseminating disinformation. Brilliantly, he shows up to a town hall meeting that he knows is televised and knows will be posted on the internet.
Just a thought experiment.

Yes. These guys aren't understanding that lines of code is a useless metric in maintaining software. 
It's like paying an architect by the amount of wood he uses on a building. You'll end up with six foot thick walls and roof that will eventually crumble under their own weight.
Or it's like paying a surgeon by the length of skin he cuts into. It perverts the incentives.

I love the idea. I call dibs on working on the documentation.

Everyone works for a living. Just most people don't whine about it like you. Get over yourself.

Wait, how do you conclude they are a criminal?

How about... don't be an ungrateful cunt. You have one of the easiest jobs in the world. You literally write down on a piece of paper what people want to eat and then you carry it about 20 feet from point A to point B. You threw away your tip because you are lazy.
