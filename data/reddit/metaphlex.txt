Three: geothermal, tide power generation, and nuclear.

I wish there was someone else who cared more that could explain to you why you are wrong. Nuclear, geothermal, and tides do not have their energy come from the sun. Arguing that we need the sun for these because without the sun stuff would be different doesn't change the fact that the ENERGY is not coming from the sun.

I just don't understand why everyone is this thread wants to be incredibly pedantic about this. Saying that we get energy from geothermal and nuclear power that does not come from the sun is true in every sense that matters. And, yes, a smaller part of tidal forces comes from the sun's gravity.

Tides. Geothermal. It depends on how philosophical you want to get with "comes from the sun."

Everything you said is wrong except for the part about the tides. While the sun plays a minor role, most of the energy comes from the moon. And water would be ice without the sun.

There would still be tides without the sun. There is still geothermal without the sun.

Some credit unions will do this type of thing where you give them say $500 that goes into a no risk security. They then loan you $500 with no (very little?) interest that you pay back. After it is paid off you get the security deposit back. 
This way, the bank is taking on zero risk, and you get the credit score benefit of having paid off a personal loan.

So the energy doesn't really come from the sun. It comes from the galaxy. But it doesn't really come from the galaxy, it comes from the big bang. 
This is not how we normally treat reality or conversation. It is overly pedantic.
