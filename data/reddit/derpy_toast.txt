Needles and feeble attempt to discredit a valuable post. Title is self explanatory

This is why crypto currency will replace banks for our future generations
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:43:45
It's safe, not necessarily the best. (To be clear, I entirely recommend it for someone uncertain about crypto currency's future)

They said they were going to be going down for maintenance well in advance

No, it's sircha, made of 100% malk

The internet didn't have a bubble, don't be silly. The dotCom bubble was from shitty companies abusing the advantage of having technology based names, getting funding then cutting and running. A parallel can be drawn between those companies and all these new companies that are throwing in "block chain" and such in their names.

Did you... Not read the bill? All 500pgs of it with all the hastily scribbled, illegible notes appended right before the moonlit session?
The bill explicitly fucks over the type of people that would have a need for something like Bitcoin.

If it were without use, he would not have been able to sell it...

To be fair, there are many people that say "they looked at me like I was crazy" and they still are. It's wonderful that btc and crypto is taking off, but it's still risky with many wealthy and powerful people that stand to lose (or make) alot of money regardless of which way btc goes.
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:55:27
Possible but not without some major fud and market manipulation.
Remember, if massive swings like that happen, sell all your coins so I can buy them up lol
@_date: 2018-05-04 11:59:45
... no

these "cry troll" posts are worse than actual troll posts and only serve to make this subreddit look very immature
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:12:39
Hopefully in a few years lol

They still have a fee in addition to the miner fee. Also, I feel that f you want to dump some money into btc quick(for example to buy a 5500 dip) then a 4% fee isn't that serious.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:03:42
Can you name some examples? I'd like to research more about it but don't know what to look in to.
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:17:04
While I'm not a huge fan of coinbase, there aren't too many other options to buy btc at the best price for the lowest (or in some cases $0) fees

"correction" because gdax is unaccesable?

8 year olds know what thumb drives are, this isn't the 90's lol

This is really low quality shilling for a coin that honestly doesn't need it...
@_date: 2018-02-28 18:56:48
That's all terribly ignorant. Thanks for sharing!

You make made gain without reinvesting by reinvesting?
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:05:24
Too late now, already up to $2.00

The age of information is being supplanted by the age of misinformation
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:44:23
True, but I think that would be considered repositioning.by cash out I'm implying the funds go elsewhere and not back into the same asset

To be fair, the graphic spells cap with a k and two P's. It's not trying to appeal to people that think about stuff...
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:25:02
You sound like you have no idea what you're talking about...
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:14:40
Mmm not quite...
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:20:29
No, it's explicitly a judgment thing...
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:15:26
Buying an ath is always a bad idea, but if the history of crypto is anything to indicate, you'll be fine if you don't cash out at a loss
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:08:52
I was under the impression that mining was still pretty expensive
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:26:00
No, you cherry picked. The rest of the blog post makes it immediately clear what their intentions are and we're.
