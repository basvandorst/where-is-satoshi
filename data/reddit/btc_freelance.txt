Paying a high fee to get into a block meanwhile some miners are mining empty blocks, get the reward (for doing nothing), plus the high fees from poor people.  
We replaced the greedy banksters for greedy miners now?!

So what I should say now to miners? "Would you ripp me off charging me high fees, meanwhile you are mining empty blocks, get the rewards, so I can pay for my sister's meds?"  
This is ridiculous how some are pushing for high fees....  
Where is the "banking the unbanked"? Oh Bitcoin now is not helping anymore the "unbanked"? Only the rich guys playing with tons of money?

Yes, I could connect Spark wallet to my server, on local LAN and also from external IP (opening the ports on my router).  
The Spark wallet is OK, also the managing node and channels from the web page. Is simple and spartan, with no fancy things. it can be used just fine, but the issue come when you want to use it in a shop, the employees DO NOT have a restriction to not be able to make payments, just receive. So for an individual, this solution is just enough. Not for a merchant.  
That's why I wanted to test LND with ZAP and macaroons read only.  
My docker with spark was like this:  
command: --login --pairing-qr  --print-key --no-tls  
And worked like a charm. But yes, no other wallet can connect to that node.  
If you want I can pass you my yml file that worked, for c-lighning + spark + c-lightning charge  
Maybe in the near future we will have more features for Spark wallet. But until then it will be good to test also the other solutions. I think each merchant will have his own setup and each LN solution can find his place.

do you also choose to use docker to make easier backups for the node volumes?
