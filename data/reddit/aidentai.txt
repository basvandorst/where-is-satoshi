Yes, I thought it would be obvious satire, but apparently people can't tell :(

Simply because Mt. Gox is the most reliable, most trustworthy of the exchanges. They've been around for longer than all the other popular ones, and it shows in terms of their customer care and their swift responses to any problems users may have. Also their technical back‐end is unmatched in terms of speed and reliability. Their fees might be slightly higher than other exchanges, but I'd willingly pay those higher fees in exchange for peace of mind.  
  
Ninja Edit: Well, people if you can't tell, that was sarcasm. Guess next time I need this: &lt;/SARCASM&gt;

I was being completely sarcastic, but people didn't notice I guess :(

Crytocurrencies like Bitcoin operate on a shared ledger divided into sections called blocks. In order to get put on the permanent shared ledger, you have to wait for a miner to take your transaction and "process it" into a block, and they will do so based on a prioritisation that takes your transaction fee into account (the more you pay in fees, the higher a priority they will give your transaction). Once your transaction has been incorporated into a block it will appear as having one confirmation. Then after the next block is mined approximately ten minutes later (on average but can vary) a second confirmation will appear, and so forth. After six confirmations your Electrum wallet will simply show a check mark to indicate "complete" acceptace of your transaction by the network.

People are forgetting something: according to the article, $2.9 million is the amount seized from the **Dwolla account**. Let's not forget that the biggest concern during this raids on Mt. Gox was actually their USD bank account holdings at **Wells Fargo**. The amount lost in this seizure *has not* been disclosed, but would be *in addition* to this $2.9 million. Even without the Wells Fargo account, almost $3 million is a lot to lose for a company whose net revenue (not profit!) over the last four months—which includes April, when everyone and their mother was using Mt. Gox—was only $8 million.

NOO! That would lead to waay too much confusion. I say just have people type 1BTC when they want to play with a bitcoin.

They have JavaScript, which is not the same as Java. Honestly I never see Java online except for on a couple game sites and on company intranets. Both sites work for me, anyway, and I can assure you Java is totally blocked in my browsers.
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:47:07
I don't have Java installed for security reasons and I get along just fine. Some programs written in Java like iTunes bring their own Java RE with them that only the program uses, so it's not a security issue as its not available to viruses.
@_date: 2013-04-19 21:55:34
But Java unlike say, Silverlight, .NET, native executables or something has both permission to run in browsers (and installs itself into browsers as a plugin by default) and has TERRIBLE security, meaning there are so many Java vulnerabilities that drive by attacks are pretty easy.
@_date: 2013-08-20 21:37:47
Yeah, I'd change 1B to a billion seeing as 1M and 1K are a million and a thousand respectively. Why not say 1BTC instead?

The others are remaining stable while Gox is rising. That's a sign of something being wrong with Gox. People are either impatient or scared.

While no one outside those involved knows for sure, it's common for there to be a bank account which has the main holdings, and is safeguarded. While the public‐facing accounts (Dwolla) hold only minimal balances as needed to maintain smooth withdrawals and serve as an acceptance point for incoming funds. If deposits exceed the stable amount needed for withdrawals, these are typically flushed into the main holding account to accrue interest. Additionally the bank account was probably used for wires and for internal Mt. Gox transfers.

Or just uninstall it completely.

Well, you could use CampBX. Buy a money order and mail it to them, and voilà. Or use Dwolla (but Dwolla's obviously not anonymous). They don't require any account verification for users in order to use Dwolla though, unlike Mt. Gox. They charge 0.55% per transaction, with a permanent 10% discount if you use a referral link (like [this one]( :) ).

Right, from what, about 97 or so to 100 (and BitStamp was already about ahead of it in price, so now it decreased the difference). But compare that to Mt. Gox, which rose over $10 overnight *on top of* the existing $10 difference in price between it and BitStamp/BTC‐E.

Thing is, I don't know if you've been reading outdated information or what, but nowadays mining on a regular computer is a good way to lose money. Unless you have excellent GPUs, dedicated miners, or ASICs, you're going to spend more on electricity than you will gain from mining because ordinary computers are so very inefficient when compared with the current crop of miners.  
  
If you want to got into Bitcoin, at this point you'll need to find an exchange ([Mt. Gox]( [CampBX]( or [Bitstamp]( are good choices) and purchase Bitcoins from others.

1) Simply drive out to another state. Even though your documents are issued in your home state, you can still get a notary in your neighboring states to certify them.  
2) A common procedure in states that don't allow certified copies is to have you do the following:
a. Photocopy your document.  
b. Print out a document which states that the attached photocopy is a true copy of your passport/whatever.  
c. Also include a space for the notary to sign with a statements like "taken, subscribed, and sworn before me this...day in...". Search this phrase and you should find some samples.  
d. Bring the original document along with the photocopy to a notary public. Have them witness you sign the attached document, and them have them notarize it using the "taken, subscribed..." space on that document.  
e. Take the photocopy and the attached (eg. stapled) document you printed to wherever you need to go to get apostilles in your state.

Mt. Gox is having major troubles, but is the largest. No ACH, just wires and an odd assortment of services including Dwolla. Currently pretty questionable for stability and reliability.  
CampBX accepts checks, wires, and a few services like Dwolla.  
Bitfloor accepts wires and allows withdrawals (only withdrawals) in ACH.  
  
Thing is most of these services are outside the US, making ACH hard to setup and use given the small nature of these exchanges.

Why is 1B chips only 100,000,000 chips? It would be really good to be able to practice in a sandbox or with play money before joining real tables.

Some clients have a view‐only mode that does not require decryption. But to access the private keys and to create a transaction they do require a password.
