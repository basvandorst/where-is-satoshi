Looks like I need to get more bitcoin to work my way up to being a bitcoin elite.

We all hear these funny remarks. It actually makes me laugh to hear. I heard the same thing when I bought gold and silver yet I am doing quite well on that. When I bought silver you could get a meal at MCDs for $3-4. I don't know how much it is now since I moved out of that place to a better land. But I have to assume it is a lot more. So how has that fiat beenfor them? Wish I had got in bitcoin earlier. But atleast I am in before the take off. Started buying bitcoin at $270.

Hahaha. You gave me a good morning chuckle.

The story is accurate.

Thanks for offering your advice! I am new to bitcoin. It is very exciting and feels like freedomto me. I am still learning about bitcoin. I am looking for ways I can earn bitcoin by investing in business with bitcoin or earning bitcoin thru activities/work. Can you give me some direction?

Thanks. I have always been self employed so I would more likely be looking for ways to earn bitcoin thru business or subcontracting. I am looking at Steemit and my retail shops accept bitcoin. I imagine a world where we can invest as a shareholder in businesses with bitcoin anonymously.

I agree with Nyeko. I have been happy with bitpesa as a client. It is too bad they  have this reoccurring problem. Big business doesn't like competition.

Hoping for the same. My friend is waiting for $400. I don't see a bottom yet. You never know but I wil be ready when I feel it's time to get back in.

DmesticG - Do you have income? Can you pay it back in a reasonable time without touching your bitcoin? I would say cost average but don't rush in with emotion. Investing in bitcoin now can change your life but will likely be a rollercoaster for some time. If you don't have income of some kind don't put it all in. If you were my son I would have been happy you were asking for money to invest instead of money for beer. I missed opportunities when I was your age because I spent my money on beer and women even though I believed in Microsoft and Amazon etc. and thought they were good investments. Find income and decide how much to cost average into bitcoin. I only buy on dips. If you have income start paying back the loan immediately even if it is small payments.

Also, I look at bitcoin as a volatile savings account that will hold value or increase in value during times of instability. My businesses will continue if fiat dies or survives or if bitcoin dies or survives. Keep that in mind when you consider having a source of income. In life the biggest risk is taking no risk at all.

Africa is so under appreciated by the west. Good post. I enjoyed the sarcasm.

Thumbs up on that!

Why would they not try to naked short it to oblivion just like commodities? This gives them a tool to cap the price or push people away from something that can destroy their fiat. I have no trust for the manipulated markets. This will put bitcoin in the cross hairs of the criminals. Until there is a reset of the entire system I vote to stay out.
