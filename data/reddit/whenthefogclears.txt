 No chance ever, exchanges will always be under threats of hacks, simply because they have BTC, and BTC is a limited supply, and everyone who owns it, these hacks will go on forever.
Banks are completely different.

So how do you work out, whether or not you’ve made more buying BTC like this, or whether you’d have just been better buying with fiat at the appropriate times.
Wouldn’t want my wages used to buy BTC if the price was high , I’d prefer a low price for buys, surely you’re better keeping  in the fiat in the bank and buying when the price is low.
Bitcoin is a basket case, it always goes back down.

Nobody cares about futures contracts, it’s all hype and bollocks, you’ll soon be disappointed when you find out there either cash settled or worse that they have a low uptake.
I personally thing both.
I mean what have futures contracts that are offered today done for the BTC price, sweet fuck all, so whys everyone so hyped, desperation I think.

Oh except Quebec hey, that doesn’t sound crypto friendly LOL.
You maybe have problems because Canada is the united stated dirty diaper neighbour ��‍♂️, who knows.
Anyway I wouldn’t sweet it, over it, as no one cares about Canada anyway, who cares whether they can buy BTC, just means there is more for the rest of the world ��.
@_date: 2019-01-02 14:47:13
Why would a government want to do that, there would be no benefits for that.
You maybe don’t realise this but most times a government party gets elected, it gets elected because it has tax friendly policies, not because it say we are going to increase taxes for everyone.
Plus if every individual could see how taxes were allocated and spent in that finer detail, I’m presuming also that wouldn’t be good for any political party in power, because tax spending isn’t black and white.
And neither is open blockchain, even though people think it is.
@_date: 2019-01-03 15:57:33
I don’t care about comparing the internet to Bitcoin, the same as I don’t compare mainstream financial products with Bitcoin either, as they are different.
First mover advantage is not a given either, nor is it a given that states it will last, that’s just opinion.
So for me network effects irrelevant, you’re only need in a niche market, so if many other people decide they  like another coin more, that coin could be taken on, over an existing one, if your so wrapped up in one coin that you wouldn’t admit BTC being toppled isn’t possible then I can’t help you.
Oh and with BTC having such a low price and small market cap, miners could easily change what they mine, if the demand was there, because of the BTC price collapsed they would move on.
@_date: 2019-01-01 14:27:19
When people ask about crypto it shows they are interested.
When people get told about crypto but didn’t ask about it, they are probably  not interested in it.

I’ve never seen a Bitcoin ATM picture on reddit, that has a queue at it, is there a reason for this, like no one uses them.
@_date: 2019-01-04 07:51:03
If this is a blockchain system without a token reward (or incentive to secure the network via this financial reward), the Blockchain won’t have any or very little security,  no one secures for nothing.
So it’s just a database of information and a slow one at that, compared to other data bases.
So if a bank was running this kind of system you’d have to ask how they secure the money on the Blockchain.
@_date: 2019-01-03 17:03:54
I mined BTC in 2011, so I know all about mining the point you’re missing is no one would buy them now if the market collapsed and even if the difficultly adjusts, I’d doubt there would be many people bother about mining them after such a catastrophic collapse, and there is no way that network would be as strong as now, in the early days 51% attacks could of easily double spent, the reason this didn’t happen was no one knew or cared about BTC.
And no BTC cannot scale, it never could so as a payment rail, without “LN” or if “LN”fails it will be useless in that  major usage.
You’ll find that’s why they are desperately working to fix this major issue.
And how do you know you’ve been in this space longer than me, I started mining BTC in may 2011, that’s pretty early, I think you’re very presumptuous in your view.
Bitcoin core is slow with updates because they refine so much, “what bollocks”, there have been many blaring incidents in bitcoins software over the years that have nearly finish it, the only reason it’s alive today is because a bad player didn’t get hold of those faults before they had chance to patch them, if you’d have been in BTC for this long you should realise all this, so there was a large investment then but it could of all turned into smoke overnight.
Also volatility, economics lessons now, for BTC per unit to have less volatility each coin would need a value of around $280’000 dollars, and because BTC has seen more selling than buying which is how you arrive at such a low price per unit as we do have today, we can clearly see adoption is slow, you should understand price high is only gained in real terms by demand constantly outstripping supply, which it clearly isn’t.
Oh and please stop saying in the future, in the future, it’s laborious, you can’t constantly use that as an excuse for the failing now.
@_date: 2019-01-04 07:25:37
What do you mean?
@_date: 2019-01-03 19:37:27
Your going around in circles, look at the fact no one mines bitcoins for no block reward, the only people who’ve done that is a few early people who took a chance, Bitcoin then could of been overwhelmed by a 51 % attack any day of the week, the point is no one bothered or knew or in that fact cared.
And game theoretical model as your calling it, is nothing more than a fancy way of saying don’t cheat the system or you’ll financially cut your own throats (meaning mining pools).
And Bitcoin won’t get to $280 dollars because you don’t understand people theory and boom and bust, you see no ones buying now, not enough to move the price.
And every bust after a boom, more and more people lose interest or are put off, you’ve seen 8 cycles now in BTCs life span of boom and bust, Xmas 2017 being the biggest gain and the highest fall.
I don’t want to depress you but usually humans realise eventually via word of mouth that people have lost money, once isn’t enough, but when Bitcoin goes through this cycle 3 or 4 times each time crashing no one will buy.
Ok you’re  bound to ask why will it crash time and time again, well history already dictates this, plus economically wise people cash out causing the price to fall.
Example BTC gets to 50k, everyone cashes out through fear the drops coming, the market crashes because more and more see the price dropping, once you hit bottom people buy again, but this cycle like I’ve said will stop one day, as no new recruits join the pyramid.
This is how it has worked up to now and will till it’s death.
The only smart people are the early adopters who mined or bought for peanuts, and the smart people who are willing to take profits and cash out all their holdings, because they’re not emotionally attached to the Bullshit.
Live and learn.

Yes there are things coming and I’m sure it is more secure than some other things, but some things seem like white elephants also especially LN.

Yes I think they do indeed.
@_date: 2019-01-03 16:16:01
That’s complete reddit tosh talk.
Firstly all it would take is the miners to decide they weren’t mining BTC anymore, that could happen if the price went low enough, you forget they only mine because of profit, you also forget without they mine or the less hash power there is the weaker the network becomes.
They will mine what ever is most profitable and no one knows what will happen down the line.
Bitcoin is working on scaling because it’s dead without LN, it’s doing this because it has too!.
As for bulletproof, Bitcoin always seems late IMO with its software updates, take BEAM, and GRIN, both have implemented mimblewimble as a way around these privacy concerns, BTC could have also used mimblewimble yet they chose bulletproofs instead, my point is those developers are late compared to others.
As for store of value, volatility isn’t store of value, store of value is an asset with low volatility, not not high volatility, there really is a huge difference and why people still use this term is bizarre, and shows little understanding of wealth issues.
Gold isn’t going away, it’s value can be relied upon, no one can say the same about BTC this is why people are advised not to invest more than they can afford to lose.
Lose generally being the operative word, ask anyone who comes late.

Yes I agree, and the price is reasonable.
@_date: 2019-01-07 18:08:38
Yeah it probably is, but considering most savvy people use a hardware wallet, we should be able to gauge how many own crypto, and the numbers aren’t so impressive.
Any idea how much these Bluetooth jobs is?
But I like the idea, rather than doing shit on the computer all the time.
And yeh maybe best letting the hackers, hack it a bit before buying, but I’m pretty impressed with Ledger, even the hack people didn’t really worry it.
@_date: 2019-01-03 20:22:48
It’s probably correct but it’s kinda irrelevant, because hodling and using contradict each other, not that I think people should spend crypto as I think spending fiat makes more sense.
But holding doesn’t help a payment network or adoption into these fields.
Also there are still many horror stories of those who bought late and now have massive loss and debt.
Nothing is clean cut in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-01-07 16:09:56
It’s interesting reading these comments, what I wonder is, do they really have the capacity to chase every bitcoin purchase?
I think not, also do they really have the capacity to trace every buy and transaction, I think not.
Are you going to have a sector of people who declare all and pay tax, and a sector that doesn’t, if they change the law, so it’s a currency and not an asset, all the suckers who’ve paid tax won’t get it back, whereas those that didn’t pay will be laughing.
It’s only a matter of time before they realise it’s un policeable.

I agree with the guy above, saying that the equilibrium price over the last couple of months is a sign of a bull run is rubbish.
Earlier this year the price was higher than today and acting in the same way, until it plummeted down to the level its at today.
Personally I think it could go down more than it is now quite easily, as it’s clear demand is allusive at present.

How can he say this, he’s not got a clue what’s around the corner or what other developers are working on, yeah it could be Bitcoin but then is may as easy be another coin no ones seen yet.
And I don’t get what’s he’s talking about when he says about Bitcoins privacy, “wake up” it’s not that private, and less so when every exchange including his asks for your “IDENTIFICATION DETAILS”, maybe when BTC has some cloaking mechanisms for completely anonymous transaction I will agree.
@_date: 2019-01-03 11:12:06
Well the last part is what I already told you, more demand than supply will cause increase yes, but because demand is low now, why do you or anyone else think it will be higher in the future?.
Yes also if there is little or no demand the price would be low or maybe zero, exactly.
Demand isn’t constant though, if it was you wouldn’t have price drops, your not grasping this, just like many others don’t, sell offs on mass don’t equal constant demand.
And like I said before a market with so much manipulation in, means no one really knows what demand is like apart from it’s not high and could be even lower if you factor in price high manipulation.
@_date: 2019-01-03 11:46:19
I though I had taken it into account, based on what I’ve said even with a limited amount and a decreasing supply, demand at present doesn’t represent a growing price value.
I’d base this evidence that adoption is extremely slow, and on that evidence I can’t see future demand being that great either.
If you want a bargain then now is the time to buy, if people aren’t causing demand issues with prices low, then I think that’s an ominous warning sign.
That said this demand could change but I’m not convinced from what I’ve seen or see, real sting to prices.
@_date: 2019-01-04 07:46:11
Yes you’re correct.
That is what they are doing through regulation, and if we are honest about it, Bitcoin companies and the like are bowing to these regulations which do make Bitcoin in some ways less centralised than satoshi meant for it to be.
Even the public who transact in it are willingly giving up their own identities, when it’s meant to be an anonymous peer to peer network.
@_date: 2019-01-05 20:58:52
They’re trying to make money as always, and regulation is how they think the easy route is.
@_date: 2019-01-03 13:07:35
These things work well, but for the average person who won’t take these risks they’re useless.
And crypto’s biggest problem is security and I can’t see that changing, very hard to convince the public to become their own bank.
@_date: 2019-01-02 14:35:30
You referred it, by inferring if you don’t pay tax on crypto infrastructure services and other wouldn’t get paid for.
That’s why I pointed out the government would still have tax, because crypto would never be the only means of collecting tax.
@_date: 2019-01-04 08:48:45
Yes I’d agree completely, this is more a reason why people should own their own private keys and also keep all their crypto funds off exchanges. 
Hopefully we can reach this point sooner rather than later.
@_date: 2019-01-05 21:05:59
Open source is fine, until the day someone injects some kind of malware into its source code.
Trezor didn’t do as well as ledger overall when they were hacked, think that was more down to its open source code.
@_date: 2019-01-02 15:17:23
They always have a choice, they’re always in control, the reason why people don’t have power is because they have debt, you have a choice protest and strike and take your chances of losing all you own, or carry on under the thumb of the authorities, most sane people choose the later even though it’s not ideal.
You can protest as much as you like, but the facts are and governments know, sooner or later the protestors get bored, and then they protest no more, all those authorities do is contain the situation.
Like most people on here will talk about the US going bankrupt, but the US are a nation state, they can’t go bankrupt.
And the reality is everyone thinks that everywhere should have money, that’s never been the case and never will, crypto currency won’t change this, because people are greedy and the ones with the most money will always own the lions share of that crypto and be able to influence the market, that’s not freedom.

@_date: 2019-01-02 11:17:46
I cannot understand if people are surprised at this, how can you own an asset and not understand supply and demand, this is clearly supply and demand in action.
The more people buy the more the price increases, because you limit supply.
The more people sell the more the price goes down, because you’ve increased supply.
@_date: 2019-01-01 16:13:02
I don’t care what you think, that’s the whole point, you’re ridiculous scribbling means nothing at all.
@_date: 2019-01-02 14:21:18
Yeah right, you’ve already paid tax on the money you’re buying the BTC with, so the basis of this tax regulation is they are taxing you twice, once before you enter, and then again when you leave depending on your gain.
The reality is that there should be no tax on purchases, nor on crypto swaps, if any tax is to be paid it should only be on exit, but I personally disagree with that.
I wouldn’t pay any tax if I was you, because the tax authorities are not going to be able to tax every purchase or trace every individual.
They will in my opinion give in, and make it easier, not for the crypto user, that will just be a consequence, but for themselves as they’ll soon realise if people don’t comply they’ll not have the resources or the time, collecting tax is a time consuming process, if those who owe it don’t comply.
@_date: 2019-01-02 09:12:47

�� if you’re about 12 and don’t understand economics then you may think that.

And it’s such a childish conversation I wouldn’t care to have it with anyone ��.
@_date: 2019-01-06 13:08:25
I agree in part about ATMs and that crypto has other avenues where it and how it can be adopted.
Personally I agree with the Hodlers as, fiat is a lower value currency than BTC, so spending BTC doesn’t make sense, which until higher prices are reached won’t change IMO.
BUT, I don’t like calling BTC a currency because it’s an asset and not a good currency, using it thus doesn’t make sense, until it’s reclassified, which I think will happen.
If I buy £30 worth of BTC and spend it in six months I have a tax gain to pay tax on if the £30 value has increased, also I have a tax at a given amount to pay on purchases, so I can’t call BTC currency.
@_date: 2019-01-06 12:55:50
Yes, and here is the reason I don’t personally take on board all the adoption hype, I’ve said on numerous occasions on reddit that there is a huge difference between offering a service and calling it adoption, and real adoption which is people using that service.
Now I can take crypto payments in my shop, and I can have an ATM in my shop, but are people really using them and paying with crypto, I don’t think they are enough to move the price.
I think ATMs are the perfect tool for the local drugs lord, to wash his ill gotten gains, but as for adoption I don’t see it.
@_date: 2019-01-01 09:13:05
Your over thinking things completely.
1) The Bitcoins are always on the Blockchain where they are secure and hack free.
2) The person who owns the private key that’s linked to those Bitcoins owns them, ownership is via the private key.
3) If they are in a Hardware wallet or a wallet on your phone, all you’re seeing is the balance of how many you have, the reality is they are digital code and always stay on the Blockchain.
If you own the deeds for a house and the house key �� you own the house.
The same with crypto, the key owner, owns the coins and can access them whenever they like.
Like the cloud, you stare data in the cloud and you may access this data via a password, same thing except crypto or especially Bitcoin is really really secure.
Because no one could ever guess your private key.
@_date: 2019-01-03 10:41:53
Nobody said there wasn’t demand, I said the demand is lower than the supply, otherwise you’d have higher increases in price.
You’re confused, the price would only be at zero if all coins were sold and there was no demand at all.
What you should pick up on from what I’m telling you in adoption is really low.
Also what people don’t also understand about Bitcoin is how much ones worth in reality, for example if £2000 of the price is manipulation via trading bots and other shady unregulated practices, that would give you a BTC price of just over £1000 uk at today’s price.
Now you saw that in 2017 when the price collapsed, clearly this isn’t adoption but many manipulations working to push the price higher and higher.
If 100 million people all bought a Bitcoin today the price would shoot up in dramatic circumstance, you can see this is not happening.
Welcome to reality.

Yes proof of keys, they’ll be panicking that they’ll be shown to be manipulating the amount of BTC they have.
@_date: 2019-01-03 10:11:45
Supply decreases yes, but that doesn’t mean that the price goes up.
You need demand stronger than the decrease for this to happen.
Just because something has a limited supply it’s not a given that it will have value either.
Bitcoin hasn’t seen demand yet either, this has been proven, because the price increases in 2017, have pretty much been shown to be, complete manipulation of the price because the market wasn’t regulated, and probably can’t be.
Either way be sure that while you have a low or stable price there is no one buying more that the available supply.
@_date: 2019-01-03 08:18:13

You have no content in what you say ever, you offer no proofs, I don’t buy Bitcoin I mined BTC early years, that doesn’t mean I agree with everything on reddit, or with everyone on reddit because all that does is make you a puppet.
I’m not worried far from it, I’ve pointed out some of it’s failing, failings you clearly are ignoring, talk of seashells shows how laborious this BTC versus  fiat argument is.
The real truth is no one in the real financial world cares, as the dollar or euro or yuan, or sterling, Swiss franc, is what people crave, this is why they cash BTC out for these fiat currencies, I mean that’s the biggest joke isn’t it that BTC only has value because it’s linked to fiat.

Numerous report and individuals in this space say they are shying away also, whether or not they want a system like the one they have is not important, as they won’t get it, you can’t reign in a decentralised system in this way with regulation “it won’t work”.
Custody works like this not your keys, not your coins, and hardware wallets is where you store those keys, it’s as simple as this.
Endowment providers, pension funds ect, are not likely to risk that money on an asset that has dropped by 80% within a year, and certainly not when they already know regulation is nigh on impossible.
And as you say it is not “their money”, even more reason to believe they’re less likely to take this risk.
Bitcoin is completely different because it’s not regulated properly and because it’s tax laws are at best sketchy, it is completely different from mainstream investments.
I have owned BTC since 2011, so i have a good knowledge and I’ve seen it develop, but I wouldn’t lie about what it is or can do.
“Many around the world are not buying” tothe point they are creating supply issues or the price would be rising, so that’s not really a statement that means anything in real terms.
You will find more have sold or are selling.
And if reddit only represents 7% of people globally that own BTC and r/Bitcoin has only just passed a million individuals, that means it’s a tiny proportion of the worlds populous, and I really mean “TINY”.
Like I’ve said for ever now, BTC is based on speculation, you can see it’s adoption rate via the price (supply and demand).
There are more companies than “ever sacking people “,because they can’t pay them, because the pyramid of BTC isn’t generating money so they cannot pay wages ect.
The same as if you look into payments there are as many shops and businesses stopping accepting BTC for payments as there are trying it out, and they generally stop because they are losing because of the tax implications, if you would like links for any of the subjects I’ve brought forward, let me know and I’ll ping them over for you.
Also when someone says great my local shop accepts Bitcoin, and everyone sees this as some big adoption move, it is not adoption, it’s a “declaration of a fact”, it does not mean anyone will use it and often they don’t.
Adoption is people downloading wallets and buying BTC, the price highs don’t come from anything other than this,”simple supply and demand”.
Software advances don’t add monetary value, they add technical value that may or may not bring more people, which can then add value,  it is this that is not a given.
The same applies to halvenings without the demand is constantly out stripping supply you won’t have large price moves, halvenings have come and gone and faded into history without anything of any significance.
BTC as money or currency is terrible, who gets or pays tax on money, you BUY BTC with money you’ve already been taxed on, BUY BTC hold it or spend it, if you hold it your taxed on any gain, depending how much you paid at the time, then you have tax on the purchase price, yet people are still walking around oblivious that it is taxable and the IRS will want those taxes off individuals who are using it.
The above example shows it’s ridiculous, who in finance wants this yet, my opinion is only those who want the same speculation model, and that will kill BTC eventually, unless the tax laws are changed it won’t ever work, and as for regulation one country may listen, I assure you the others won’t.
@_date: 2019-01-03 15:05:42
Nope I wouldn’t touch Bcash.
But this is a very strange opinion because if there is ever qualities to a protocol that are better denying them is fools folly.
If you have one crypto that can scale and one that can’t, irrespective of its name, if it is secure its use case is better for that specific thing.
And people are building protocols like these now, from the bottom up.
Am open mind is what is needed, being blinkered means any potential competitor will walk right past you.
@_date: 2019-01-01 09:00:01
I think someone may roll out a whole new crypto currency from scratch that can already scale, thus making Lightening a thing of the past.
Doesn’t seem like it’s viable, seems like there are many answers people have that can’t be answered, and also they don’t have forever, because people will be working away on other projects.
Just because some woman has a bubbly face and says the right things, that doesn’t mean she’s Bitcoins saviour, and remember Bitcoin is finished without it can scale, as it was before LN was proposed.
You can’t have a crypto coin that cannot scale.
@_date: 2019-01-03 14:11:54
I’ve owned BTC since 2011 so you don’t have to teach me, I’m saying even if banks go belly up, you still won’t convince everyone crypto is right.
And considering America can only go bankrupt if they choose that themselves, which they won’t you maybe waiting along time for banks to go bust haha.
@_date: 2018-12-28 07:45:27
Where ever you are, it only needs all participants in each individual country to take part, look at the size of Australia, there must be loads of crypto holders there, it’s just spreading the word, then the next time zone buys, and the next and on, and let’s just see what happens.
It a simple experiment, if it’s good, we can do it again.
@_date: 2018-12-27 20:02:50
Yes I see that also, but I can point out a bigger problem that’s pertinent to Bitcoin it’s self, let me explain.
This clearly isn’t easy for me or anyone else to implement, firstly I need everyone to participate, this is difficult because they either think it’s a scam or are not interested.
Well this is why BTC doesn’t spread also, it’s an irony that people aren’t jumping in with both feet IMO.
@_date: 2018-12-27 17:06:13
Maybe they would, or maybe they would hold, I really don’t have all or maybe any of the answers, I just was and am interested in people’s views.
@_date: 2018-12-27 19:07:56
Yes I can see that, but considering only 4% of wallets own a lot of the BTC supply, how do you intend to convince them the same as you’re trying to convince me?.
As it is them mainly who do this all the time.
@_date: 2018-12-31 06:33:23
The housing crisis, well to be accurate about who bought up those houses, it was BLACKROCK INC, may I add the CEO of BLACKROCK a man called Larry fink has little interest in Bitcoin.
Next answer, when it comes to banks buying up other banks they do so because it strengthens their bank more  (the larger banks positions), it’s a simple process of taking more market share, and getting rid of the competition.
And yes Bitcoin is distressed as any asset that loses that much over a short time frame  will be.
But comparing yet again mainstream finance with Bitcoin isn’t the best argument far from it.
No one apart from third world countries are
Buying BTC that’s the whole point, the price is stagnant, no buying only sellers.
Governments are working on legislation for control and making sure they get
Their tax. This is quite clear.
Custody hahahah, it’s meant to be called a ”private key and a hardware wallet”, no one should have custody over other peoples BTC, otherwise those people don’t own those BTC.
This is the reason why institutions can do without physical BTC as it is less hassle, you don’t need keys, wallets, ect.., but you can still have futures and play the Bitcoin market, and those investors can take profit in cash.
Institutional investor talk is for sad people who are desperate for money to enter this space as it’s a last chance, as clearly the public after 10 years have voted for one reason or another they don’t want Bitcoin, there are from their perspective more secure, insured, and less complicated options, all of which have less worry connected with them, than BTC can achieve.
I personally don’t think the money makers are that interested either, especially without its regulated so much it’s more centralised than decentralised.
You’ll see soon BAKKT will like all the rest be told NO.
And you seem like you’re another observer who only see what he wants to see, here’s my point, you talk of Wall Street buying in because prices are low right, or because this is so big an opportunity why would they miss out , and I agree there is no better time than this year for that buying in.
But why then if these people with trillions and trillions have been buying in, why then has the price still been going down?
You see you can’t have it both ways, you’re either creating demand and outstripping supply, or people are selling and increasing supply thus lowering prices.
Which is it?
From this alone you should see that Wall Street isn’t in the slightest interested, neither are their investors.
I mean if you’re not buying low ready to sell high, when would you buy?
Oh and let me point another irony and send it your way, if people are queuing at the banks to withdraw their savings because the banks are in trouble, we call this a bank run,
But when the BTC price tanks so badly through a mast sell off, this also is a form of bank run, (IE people taking their money out) yet few would dare say it or admit it, but it is true, investor interest is low and there is fear in the market as people are unsure where Bitcoin is going, 1million people on reddit isn’t the BTC market, in fact you are more likely not to get the truth off reddit because people can’t be conflicting.
The market is way bigger, and the warning signs are bigger still, but if you have know Wall Street for the last 20 years, you ride your experience and I will mine.
@_date: 2018-12-27 21:01:54
Yes you’re correct, tell anyone and everyone, the price is down now and will probably be lower by then, just consider your buy a New Years gift, spread the word ����.
@_date: 2018-12-27 22:09:34
Well there you go at least you are buying it, wasn’t so bad was it.
@_date: 2018-12-28 08:20:36
Mines more realistic though, as even if it doesn’t move the price, it could punch the odd short seller of their perches.
And it sure make known supply less, as we enter the new year.
So buy a little, it will be the tonic you need ����.
@_date: 2018-12-28 17:25:34
That’s a great start, any one who chooses to be in has my vote of approval.
@_date: 2018-12-31 17:45:30
Good I’ll buy mine soon, respect.
@_date: 2018-12-28 10:59:57
But you don’t have a clue how many will buy?
You also have no clue whether the price could be effected, or by how much?
I think it’s way less about smart people, more about luck, considering most traders lose, I find it a joke talking about smart people.
Plus for a small profit you’d have the tax implications, IMO probably not worth the hassle of selling.
It’s a social experiment to show there is no unity in BTC, also that it shows people don’t want to create supply issues, as if they did and are given a coordinated chance of doing so “they’d take part”, even if they didn’t do any of these maybes at least they were there.
People who take part in a million march, probably won’t change the world but they at least were there and tried.
@_date: 2018-12-27 18:42:49
Nope, no one owns BTC, it’s decentralised, basically that means you can do what you like when you like, and even if one country says you can’t another says you can.
No it’s no more illegal than some whale dumping coin.
@_date: 2018-12-27 11:58:35
Why can’t you leave your access code for your hardware wallet with your nominates legal representative, and at your death the family then have access to the BTC.
Doesn’t seem so complicated this way.
@_date: 2018-12-31 18:30:23
You’re so stupid, you don’t even realise you lost the argument paragraphs ago, the upvotes and downvotes prove that.
“NO” like I said your such an ill prepared and ill informed worm, you are just trying to weasel your way out of a situation you can’t.
Let’s recap.
I asked you for evidence of equilibrium with you were in a roundabout way, was saying was happening, you showed NO proof.
Next you made a right mess of using the short sell argument, and yet again it was me who offered you the proof.
Now like a sucker for punishment you’re crawling back, trying the same tactics, with unbelievably the same argument.
Yet again if you knew anything about markets you’d realise there has been and is more sellers than buyers, one day you may work this out for yourself.
@_date: 2018-12-27 18:53:02
I am not sure who has the lowest fees, I am sure someone will know, I just look at ease of buying and if it’s hassle free, I’m not that bothered about small fees, as I know BTC will rise and cancel out those fees.
@_date: 2018-12-27 08:04:49
I think you can do that, I personally don’t have the know how, but there will be many who do.
Don’t you think that’s a dangerous thing you’re planning, because of price volatility and  BTC being relatively young.
Being able to cash your funds in is a big part of holding if need arises.
@_date: 2018-12-28 13:20:00
You will tell if people want so called *FREEDOM* as if they do they’d buy it, at present they’re not in fact they’re doing the opposite.
@_date: 2018-12-29 07:29:10
Yes everything you’ve said is true, apart from one error.
You’ll admit the US came off the gold standard and thus, made it possible to be a lender of last resort, and this is because the gold standard didn’t work.
BTC is just a glorified modern day gold standard, you can’t create needed liquidity so over time in a real economy, it would fail just like the gold standard did.
@_date: 2018-12-31 17:39:21
No arsehole you just bragged to short it, I just showed you they did, if you didn’t try and be so cleaver maybe you’d have realised saying something like that in a bear market would only back fire on you (which it did ��)!!!!!!.
You are not an investor, nor have you ever been one, the best you’ve done or the closest you’ve come is owning a few bitcoins, I know this is a fact because you are clueless and constantly are proven wrong.
Investors are far more level headed than you and offer more solid advice and also come to the table prepared !!!!!.
You are probably about 18 and think because you have a Bitcoin or two you have hit the big time.
@_date: 2018-12-27 17:56:25
I agree with what you’ve said, and I would buy, I would be a willing participant in any experiment.
And I think when an opportunity arises that anyone who is part of, or has belief in BTC then why not everyone committing a little time and money.
All for a greater good.
@_date: 2018-12-27 20:20:58
Your talking crap, I don’t care how many times you read a book, it’s not a bible, Bitcoin won’t chart its own price, it’s manipulated and will carry on being.
Your calling me a jerk, in some weird American slang, yet you’re just un happy what I’ve said doesn’t fit with you ideals.
Well sonny that’s life, suck it up.
I bought in 2011 by the way, so no not at $15000
@_date: 2018-12-29 11:36:44
As in what exactly, I don’t seem to have done badly out of BTC myself, what is it you think you know better.
If you’d then like to compare your BTC holding against mine, and profits you’ve created from BTC since you first were involved, im here LOL.
@_date: 2018-12-27 09:35:21
Well I believe that with all the patience in the world if the market signals “END GAME”, for what ever reason, even hardened Hodlers will leave, as no one wants to become a bag holder.
You only have to look at tradition stocks to see seasoned traders don’t wait for the end, they jump ship well before.
All I’m saying is IMO locking BTC or any crypto away, is a dangerous game.
But hey each to their own, we all have a different view, I wish him or her the best of luck, but think before you act is paramount.
@_date: 2018-12-27 20:26:58
You don’t know what coming after 2am though do you, so how do you know if your selling at the right time.
Simply you don’t, I may be preparing myself for a mega dump, I may be sounding you all out.
@_date: 2018-12-28 10:37:32
 No thank you, you explained it very clearly indeed and it makes a lot of sense.
I have now watched the entire video, I’m afraid the technical side is way above my head, but I was very shocked, especially with how easy the stickers were removed of the boxes and devices.
They are very cleaver people.
I did hear one thing though that I wondered about?
They said that Trezor  is open source and may not always get the needed updates, whereas Ledger not being open source will get all needed updates.
Am I right in thinking that out of the two devices Ledger nano s is the more secure over all?
@_date: 2018-12-28 07:52:48
Yes I completely agree with your statement and all you’ve said, but because of the time zone issue I cannot think of a way to coordinate such an event, this is why I said only $10 dollars as this is a small amount to participate.
It’s no so easy to do, but will be fun, if everyone joins in, “what the hell”.
@_date: 2018-12-28 16:18:23
Yes you are correct I didn’t, sorry it was my wording, as clearly it won’t be possible to do all at the same time.
So I think the only option is doing it time zone by time zone and look at the end result, in some ways this may be better, as it’s a gradual buy over a period of hours.
@_date: 2018-12-27 18:39:09
Not really though about that, as that’s impossible to organise, I would say your own, and everyone one else buys at heir own, those  it’s all add up.
@_date: 2018-12-29 10:43:32
It could, or maybe will, I hope it does, but the most important thing is that the uk tell Brussels ��up yours we are leaving.
@_date: 2018-12-29 17:06:23
Exactly yes, and here is a problem BTC has, firstly people don’t like bubbles, and since BTC has been known more to the public, they the public remember the big drop (Xmas 2017), even though realistically there have been 8 or 9 bubbles that have burst.
So here is what I mean, it’s not the bubbles people don’t see, it’s the ones they do, so when BTC goes back up and it will, be sure it will go back down, because logically everyone next time will sell price high, they won’t want to be caught holding and not taking profit again.
This would signal 2 major collapses, you may get a third, but remember each time BTC collapse people who buy in late get burnt, so eventually everyone is scared off, and this is kinda what you see now, a reluctance to buy.
Does this make sense.
@_date: 2018-12-28 14:44:58
Wow are you Sherlock Holmes or a short seller that could get burnt ����‍♂️.
@_date: 2018-12-28 08:52:24
Hi does the Ledger nano s need anything doing, I often still use google chrome over ledger live app, don’t know why I just do, and I run it on windows PC?.
@_date: 2018-12-27 21:26:44
If you think, do it, don’t preach it.
You should be profiting now if you weren’t on here, the price is dropping, be quick you may make a dollar or two.
@_date: 2018-12-30 17:20:49
It’s a silly bet as I know you wouldn’t pay, regardless think what you like, if that’s your belief ride it.
@_date: 2018-12-27 16:48:26
Well that’s what I meant, everyone who owns BTC buys an amount at a set time, if everyone bought just a little with the intension of hodling in their hardware wallets not on an exchange, maybe it would raise the price.
It would be cool to do anyway, just like the key control experiment on January the 3rd.
I back any ideas that make BTC better or more fun.
@_date: 2018-12-27 18:37:24
Your a star.
@_date: 2018-12-29 08:02:04
That’s not the economic reason why at all.
I will grant you gold is heavy and not very easy to transport.
The reason why the good standard failed are many but one main reason is economic growth, you see the gold stand worked for a long time but now we know the main reason was that economic growth through those times was negligible.
They simply abandoned it at the being of World War One, the obvious reasons were that wars had to be paid for, you can only spend what you have in your vaults, for this reason gold was deflationary a finite source the same as Bitcoin, hey all good intentions let’s wait till we mine more and put that in the vault then finally we can lend more money.
Alas as you’ll see when we refer back to a now growing economy a deflationary limited amount of gold isn’t enough to spur growth and sustain it.
Hence in basic terms this is why they came of the gold standard as growing economies need extra liquidity from time to time.
As with BTC you wouldn’t have this trick up your sleeve, it sounds great but when you see the truth it would be a disaster.
@_date: 2018-12-27 20:44:18
@_date: 2018-12-31 13:34:49
The rationale behind it, “there isn’t any”, it’s just a phycological experiment knowing or playing on how greedy humans are and how no one can resist easy money ��, and it works for so long, until everyone realises there is no easy money.
In fact that message about easy money may have already got through as more have sold off, than bought.
Yeah sure loads will have bought in for the above reasons.
@_date: 2018-12-28 18:16:28
Yep you are the only one who’s got it, it’s about buying on mass, in each different time zone between those hours, I don’t care if we do or do not influence the price, all I know is there will be less BTC available after everyone buys and holds.
@_date: 2018-12-28 07:53:51
Depends how many do it, no one knows until you try.
Crypto was a dumb idea at one point.
And even if you don’t effect price, you’ve effected supply, and if all hold, you’ve effected supply permanently ��.
@_date: 2018-12-29 13:46:31
Well if people believe like they say they do, then those moonshots as you call them will be there at some point for people to use this method.
I think it’s about not being greedy and learning from the past.
@_date: 2018-12-28 14:51:26
I’m just showing that in BTC people think they’re united, yet they aren’t, they have to question in my opinion things that shouldn’t be questioned.
People should automatically agree to be part of this, same as they should automatically agree to be part of proof of keys.
BTC has some massive mountains that need climbing and I’m afraid that starts with the so called believers who own it.
@_date: 2018-12-28 10:51:24

That’s not an excuse, if people don’t buy when prices are low then they’re foolish, FOMO is when prices are higher and People’s greed kicks in.
There are many excuses in Bitcoin, I’ve heard loads and I’ll perhaps hear many more.

Congrats though looks good.
@_date: 2018-12-29 18:07:18
I think it’s sound advice, and when you are in the situation that your crypto holding are for free, then you are less likely to worry about price fluctuations.
Thanks for the support.
@_date: 2018-12-31 13:23:57
Hahaha, in the future, in the future, WHY NOT NOW, I’m sure all those rich people can’t be that stupid not to buy now while prices are low, I mean their obviously money savvy.
Ahhhh, but alas the BTC price is in the dirt, don’t seem anyone’s buying, more like their selling.
Scarcity only works if the product sells, it can be scarce and worth sweet FA.
@_date: 2018-12-31 14:49:21
That’s another I’ll informed thing you’re directing at me, you do realise (clearly not), that BTC has been shorted all year, in fact one top trader who was linked to the IMF has only just closed a short sell contract from which he made large profits.
Would you like me to send you the link?.
Let me add though, not all short sells can win, clearly, but like I’ve shown you, people always can’t answer why the price is so low, when they say every joe is buying in.
Best they can do, is do what you did, a classic get out of jail card, well short Bitcoin then.
You see what I mean.
@_date: 2018-12-27 08:18:50
Hacks I think are second place.
I think people just don’t understand it still, and because mainstream media aren’t friends with it, they the public don’t trust it.
Using Apple Pay is fine, they know Apple and trust the app, they don’t know BTC and the don’t trust it.
People are fickle, and mostly lazy ��.

I don’t think people in the uk want to leave because they did like European people firstly or because they don’t want immigrants, these things are completely false.
What they don’t like is the European courts making our laws, or telling us that we can or can’t do something.
Plus I personally don’t see the eurozone as financially stable, I think there are many countries that still haven’t recovered from 2008 onwards.

There isn’t one company that’s been in front of the SEC that has achieved their goal of physically backed futures.
Of course they expect it to be granted, but so did all the rest.
There have been loads of reports on reddit that BAKKT have approval, yet they were all lies and misinformation.
Simply put I don’t think they will get approval, it’s certain that somethings don’t feel good about this venture to the securities and exchange commission, and I think the reason is that by giving the green light in theory they are taking their hand of the hand brake so to speak.
And they don’t want a runaway Bitcoin price.
I also think the institutional investor side in this story is blown out of proportion, for the simple reason they conflict with reports from other sources.
They will end up being more cash settled contracts as this will be their last resort.
@_date: 2018-12-29 10:19:01

I don’t think BTC is going down, I think it’s going back up, but I don’t believe it will take lever the world.
I really do feel for anyone who loses money, hence the advise about taking profit until you have your initial investment out again.
@_date: 2018-12-27 22:41:14
Is this for real?
I’m presuming then that both devices aren’t secure now, and if so is it ever possible to create a wallet that is not hack able.
I am under the idea they are all un hack able until they are hacked haha.
What’s your view.
@_date: 2018-12-27 16:04:44
Haha, you see the point, I will for sure buy an amount between $10 and $100, I’m just interested how many people would do that.
@_date: 2018-12-27 09:00:55
So you believe it has advantages over normal wallets, sorry but I’m not that tech but I’m very interested.
@_date: 2018-12-28 21:28:17
Yeah exactly, if people won’t put money in BTC now how do these fuck wits predict they will when a recession comes.

Yes it could do that also, but you forget batching is around now and it wasn’t before, most high transaction costs came because the block didn’t have batching capacity.
You miss the point of supply and demand.
@_date: 2018-12-28 17:24:41
What do you mean bags?
If your inferring that I bought into BTC late and I’ve lost money and that I’m trying to pump the price so I can recoup any losses, you’d be completely wrong.
I’ve owned a substantial amount of BTC since 2011, I have never lost money on BTC, in anyway, I am independently wealthy without BTC in my life.
You and your words are a prime example of the kind of people I despair now at who actually own  BTC, you need to rethink your attitude to people who lost money and count your miserable self lucky if you were not one of them, banding around bag talk like you’ve worked on the trading floor for the last 30 years.
 Anyway moving on, this is a social experiment basically to show there is no unity in BTC, even the Hodlers who say they’re Hodlers sell behind each other’s backs.
You can stay out of this If you choose, sit at home and count whatever minuscule holding you may have, and not ever be part of anything.
But please don’t point your crap talk at me like some immature school boy, as I’m not fucking interested in the slightest.
@_date: 2018-12-27 20:23:57
No I don’t complain, I point out, I don’t care, because I know once demand constantly outstrips supply, the price will say high, it’s just convincing enough people to buy.

Don’t get your logic, anyone in the world could wake up in the morning and there has been a huge price spike, who says it’s not going higher “you”, or the man across the road or the women in the supermarket???
The point is why not, know one knows where the price could go “up or down”, and anyone who portrays so is an out and out bullshitter.

The people who buy shares if they become available in Coinbase will probably make more than their investment in BTC, Keiser isn’t stupid, the same as the guys who sold wheel barrows and denim jeans to the early gold prospectors.
That’s BS about hacks on Coinbase, proof of keys is about showing these institutions like CB are running fractional reserve BTC.

Ummm, think you’ll find though you’re paying with a card, Apple Pay is just the mechanism.
I can pay with a debit card, I wouldn’t say one is better than the other, apart from Apple Pay may be faster, yet no faster than scanning a RFID chip on a card.
And I wouldn’t say scanning a QR code is slow either.
The difference is yours is a card (middle man) supplier.

Do you think it is possible to create something that is completely tamper proof?.
Because if I was a crook and I now knew that if I could get physical access to a hardware wallet, and if I knew the right people who could then get access to the funds on said device, I think this could spur criminals to commit more burglary in search of hardware wallets.
Especially if it became more mainstream.

If you want to call that missed opportunity fine, and it may be in an ideal world.
You are not in an ideal world or an ideal market, citing what warren buffet has achieved is ridiculous because this is a man who wouldn’t touch BTC, or investments that are not productive.
Further more there are many losers in Bitcoin, fools that got greedy and didn’t capitalise on the profit they made, now those people have lost the lost.
Advising someone who is young and maybe has little money to take out their initial investment when the time or price allows, in a market like BTC is firm investment advise, only when your holding in the volatile “nobody knows” market owe you nothing can you sleep well at night.
This is why people are told not to invest more than they can afford to lose, because it’s built on shaky foundations and structures like this can come crashing down.
@_date: 2018-12-29 08:17:18
 Simple as this, Buy $50, then wait for the price to rise over $110 dollars.
Sell $50 dollars and put that money back in your saving, you will now have $50 dollars of Bitcoin that you can’t lose on, even if the price goes to Zero you can’t lose.
Always take your initial investment out when the price goes up.

You’re probably correct in your view, albeit I haven’t had any problems with the process of buying coins, it is a seamless experience for a client in many ways, and may I add adoption needs ease and not complicated.
I just revert back to my gripe about paying over the odds for setting or verifying my bank account.
I have done this many times and only needed £1, and not the £2 they ask for, so for this reason I think they should look at their policy.

Go to another post, are you so serious you’ve lost the ability to have a fun debate.
@_date: 2018-12-27 17:49:33
You are correct I know this, I think what Bitcoin is missing is sustained demand, BTC has never seen sustained demand, if it had no matter how many traders sold the demand would eat up that supply and the price would stay high.
This is one reason why trading isn’t that good for BTCs price or future.
@_date: 2018-12-29 11:45:08
Well I know that, but I also know about fractional reserve gold and that there isn’t enough gold to go round so paper contracts are common place.
Even bank audits by various countries are often stalled because the gold they have on deposit has been lent out, so many people have no choice in this matter.
Exactly the same as cash settled BTC futures contracts, it’s tantamount to fractional reserve Bitcoin.
People will always want to sell more than they have in supply, and will manipulate the price via these routes.
@_date: 2018-12-27 22:19:20

You’ll not cure that, I’ve been in BTC for a long while and I’ll tell you that you have to expect that from an unregulated, decentralised system.
Short sellers won’t like this, I say fuck em, join in my friend as they would give a shot about you.
@_date: 2018-12-27 20:17:17
Oh here we go the usual crap “Redditor for two days knob talk” I bet I know more about BTC than you, I bet I know more about finance that you, and I bet I’ve made more money in my life than you, if you ever want to spar with me go ahead but I assure you I will slay your inept knowledge of a subject you think you know something about.
By the time I’d have had my fun with you, I would have you doubting your own sanity,”little boy”.
@_date: 2018-12-29 16:08:38
Who says you can’t still do it, your clueless because you’re not patient, you should have seen the volatility early days, just because you’re not at 20k yet to be able to do this, it doesn’t mean you won’t one day be.
Why get involved if you don’t have patience, it’s no ones issue that you came to the table late.
Plus you may even have come to the table early as 10k may be a peanut price you’ve paid, if BTC hits 100k, do you see my point.
Sorry if I sound sharp, but you will get there I’m sure.
@_date: 2018-12-29 13:42:47
You’re correct, but the most laughable part is always people would like to invest, so why aren’t they ��.
@_date: 2018-12-27 18:55:52
Yes you are correct, there are sure more selling than buying, I personally don’t believe a word about institutional money.
As the price is showing the demand isn’t there and the supply is higher than the demand.
@_date: 2018-12-27 19:12:46
I don’t get your point, people like me hahaha.
Have you done your homework, every trader is like me, every whale is like me, every OTC desk help anyone be like me.
It may shock you but BTC charting its own course is a strange thing to say, I mean it’s so manipulated it would be banned under conventional trading laws, mostly this is why it can’t get its foot in the door so to speak, and why institutional investors have little or no appetite for it.
I don’t see people on reddit calling out the whales.
@_date: 2018-12-28 08:45:48
I get your point, but there in no wrong here, it’s more a social experiment and at the end of the day everyone has a little more crypto in their wallets come New Year’s Day.

This report totally conflicts another that included the likes of Barclays Bank and others, who were scrapping crypto trading desk plans due to low crypto prices and low interest from institutional investors.

@_date: 2018-12-28 08:43:02
No not at all, I have owned BTC since 2011 I have only sold twice at the peak of the 2017 bubble, I wouldn’t sell for small potatoes.
It’s a social experiment, over price rise, a show of solidarity in the community, that’s why I only stated a small amount.
Your either in or out, the more the better though.
@_date: 2018-12-27 22:11:35
I know this is a problem, but if enough people in each time zone do their own buys, we can still pump the price.

@_date: 2018-12-27 17:43:56
You could be correct, you probably know better than me, but supply and demand is what this market is about, irrelevant of traders or anyone.
If every one on earth bought BTC on that night, traders wouldn’t be able to do jack shit, because the supply has been totally eaten.
And as long as demand stayed high so would the price.

@_date: 2018-12-31 18:44:53
Listen very closely, no ones said there are no buyers, I’ve said there are way more sellers than buyers.
Also be very careful listening to false trading volumes, as in the coming months you and everyone else is going to find out how manipulated these figures are, and I assure you there will be big fines coming for all major exchanges that have participated.
The general trend you twat is bearish because people sell, and then more sell, this is what a sell off and a bear market is, I am wasting my time here with a complete and utter fool.
Oh am I have shorted BTC many times this year and I’ve made profit from it, as I’m sure many others have.
@_date: 2018-12-30 15:13:05
I’d bet you any amount you like, they’ll get refused this regulatory approval.
There is no way authority will let the BTC price run away, you are being told things for a reason, and that reason is so you buy BTC on a promise.
I don’t case what spreacher has done, he’s not in control of the SEC, they are the ones in control, that’s as simple as it is.
You’ll see, it will be cash settled.
Or the CFTC also.

“NOBODY CAN STOP BITCOIN”
Great attention grabbing headline, yet “WHO” has in reality ever said they want to stop Bitcoin.
The headline reads as if BTC is so successful that every government and mainstream financial institution and law makers sees it as such a threat that they must stop it at all costs.
When this isn’t the case, they know it’s a niche market product, with a niche market application, the real reality is they will monitor it and let it go where it is heading.
That could be it gains further traction in certain markets and applications.
Or it doesn’t and fades into obscurity.
Or thirdly another crypto type product takes its place.
@_date: 2018-12-28 08:00:23

I’m saying BAKKT will not get approval for physically backed Bitcoin futures contracts, they will IMO get approval to settle in cash just like “CME”.
And don’t you believe for one minute that the securities and exchange commission don’t care about mooned prices, they are there for the sole reason of protecting investors, especially the naive public, who not so long ago lost fortunes on the rising BTC price.
And also the CFTC, is also an independent body of the US government, they are not easily pleased especially over an asset like BTC that is virtually impossible to regulate, it’s easier just to not give permission.
Look let me break it down for you.
1) they get the go ahead, and there is major interest (which I can’t see personally) but let’s say there is.
2) this will eventually cause or should cause supply issues, driving up the BTC price.
3) news reports etc make  the public aware, FOMO kicks in again, and the price rallies, dependent on how many and a few “IF’s”, it could easily reach $50k or more.
4)BUT like always when that happens and those prices are realised, the sell off will begin, mainly because people learnt  from last time (don’t hold in), and yet again the price will collapse.
5) when said price is back in the dirt and more people have lost more money, who will they point the fingers of anger at?
You guessed it the regulatory bodies that allowed these innocent investors to get burnt yet again.
And I really do see BTC in a never ending bubble and burst scenario, just like the one I’ve shared.
@_date: 2018-12-28 17:33:46
Yes I agree but I can’t organise that yet, maybe we could at a later date, I really only want to see how many will commit his time, and how far people can spread he word.

No that won’t decrease volatility, BTC volatility won’t disappear until they’re in the region of $280 thousand dollars each, liquidity is what is needed there.
And you won’t ever get there unless you deplete supply in a sustainable way.
@_date: 2018-12-27 18:58:24
We need people buying yes, and that isn’t what is happening, in fact this year there has been more selling and the reasons are many.
A lot of people get spooked when the prices drop fast like we’ve seen.
@_date: 2018-12-27 16:14:29
So how many people own BTC?
Don’t get what you’re saying 10 thousand BTC isn’t that many, there are many more own than that.
Show me your math.
And who mentioned closest friends, I don’t think you read the post properly, it doesn’t mention that.
I’m pleased you deleted your comment, as saying you don’t know how many people own Bitcoin, but first claiming I am stupid makes me laugh ��, as I think knowing the answer to that question makes a bit part of being able to answer what would happen in said scenario.
Pure irony call me stupid, yet you clearly are the one who’s clueless ��‍♂️.
@_date: 2018-12-29 11:40:54
I don’t disagree with your statement, the people will decide, but for me people is the worrying part.
Interesting though what you said about Black and white, very interesting as I think Satoshi was a black and white thinker, there was no in between, and that isn’t a great structure when you build something.
@_date: 2018-12-30 07:13:18
Firstly Bitcoins classified as an assert, this is the reason you pay tax on it.
This means it’s not a currency even though it’s referred to as one, it doesn’t meet important parts of the criteria.
The forex market is also under main stream regulatory laws, that cut down on manipulation and illegal activity’s, and therefore any one who breaks those laws can face a prison term.
Forex markets trading regulated currencies from around the world have the advantage by being issued by a central bank the demand that Bitcoin may or may not have, that currency  demand is constant, whereas bitcoin relies on adoption and people buying in, this could be high demand  or it could be ridiculously low.
Forex volatility is around 1% for the extreme foreign currency pairs, and 0.5% or less for the others.
Bitcoins on the other hand has a volatility of around 5% to 15% with its average being around 10%, for this reason Bitcoin attracts high risk traders.
You see yes there is a forex market and yes people trade those currencies, but those currencies fit what a currency is and meant to be, whereas Bitcoin is purely speculative and because its traction as a payment is slow, it getting what value it has from speculative trading.
Now that kind of speculation along with unregulated manipulation causes  bubbles, as I said before we have seen a big one already pop, and there will be others, but only if people still buy in. along with FOMO, sooner or later after so many bubbles have been created by speculation and burst again and again, is when no one will believe or buy in anymore and it will collapse.
I would say comparing bitcoins to any regulated markets is fools folly, as there are many differences and BTC always comes out with weaker hands.
@_date: 2018-12-30 18:44:37

 But you said it *defeating the purpose of Bitcoin*, and once you say things like this just to make it succeed the like of Satoshi Nakamoto look on with ��, because Bitcoin isn’t any of that.
Not your keys not your coins, and even when they are your keys, hackers can suck them away from you so that you lose all your funds.
I don’t think people understand the true power of being united, never mind whether they understand BTCs power, I would say they need the former first.

You could be correct, there is one point each and every participant will have effected supply, that’s a good thing.
The idea is for each time zone to follow one another, there is no other way of doing it, and because everyone stays up, it’s a better time than any other.

I have spoke with people on this issue, and I do believe a completely sealed unit would help in this endeavour, as firstly you’d not be able to tamper with the internal structure, and secondly this would be a dead give away if any one did by the damage they’d cause.
Of course I think this wouldn’t be now and would need a cooperative of people with these knowledges, but maybe it could be achieved, or made so difficult that it wouldn’t be worth the hassle.
@_date: 2018-12-31 14:26:30
 No you clearly don’t understand what your talking about.
You’re saying we have an equilibrium price, because that’s what equilibrium is in the supply and demand chain, a sell that is equaling a buy, can you show me evidence of this?
You may have had equilibrium earlier this year around $5000 dollars, but you have had that for a while.
I assure you when the price is going down more are selling than buying, and there is not that many takers in the market, therefore there are many BTC available.
I’m sure rich people would be buying in a flurry if they were interested, and if they were they’d move the price.
You cannot have it both ways, any one deluding themselves that you can is only bad for Bitcoin.

It’s exactly how it works, you choose decentralised, that means anyone can do anything any time, there are no rules and no laws, one shitcoin is no different in structure to any other decentralised coin.
Please it’s a joke, take you for instance, you support free money and decentralisation, yet you choose to support it on a site full of moderators and people who will ban someone for free speech and movement.
Do you know who you are, what you are, and wants you want.
I know I’m no fake, I know mine isn’t hypocrisy, and I also know my view is true.
You cannot have all things all ways sonny.

Trading by proxy, says it all.
The biggest myth in Bitcoin to date is this over zealous view that institutional money is lining up to buy an asset that’s lost over 80% of its value.
Why would any of these guys buy into this, they are only interested if the price is high and if those highs are sustainable, until that time, or if it ever comes they will sit silently on the side lines.
Cash settled contracts will and are the norm, regulation is against crypto not for it.
This is how regulators control markets and may I add often those prices.
@_date: 2018-12-28 08:58:52
I’m not, I’m going off what Barclays Bank and many other hedge fund managers have said, and that is that they have no interest.
Take a look at the price of a Bitcoin, that’s not people buying, it’s people selling.
@_date: 2018-12-27 10:00:55
What’s your view on a hassle free working wallet time scale?
@_date: 2018-12-29 17:13:49
I agree with what your saying in part, but yes you can’t have anything both ways, I believe if you hold, the time will come, and if it doesn’t please cash out your initial investment.
@_date: 2018-12-27 22:30:06
Good you sell then.
@_date: 2018-12-29 11:02:56
What’s the main reason you prefer gold, less volatility?
Is it paper contract you have, or the real stuff?
@_date: 2018-12-25 17:41:05
That’s good news then, Bitcoin doesn’t need banks.
@_date: 2018-12-29 14:52:36
Yes and that’s why these things don’t really make sense, BTC people forget is meant to be purely peer to peer, no where in the white paper do I see banks mentioned.
Why trust others with your funds.
@_date: 2018-12-28 07:47:14
In your own time zone, just after 12 but before 1am, just get everybody you know who has crypto especially BTC to participate, spread the word.
@_date: 2018-12-29 08:24:08
Can these wallets be trusted, are they needed, it easy to download a dedicated wallet and one from a party you trust.
@_date: 2018-12-29 12:19:08
I may be a Redditor for three days, but it seems I can run rings around you, if not you wouldn’t use such an old expression.
Also I’d make a solid guess like 80% of people on reddit and elsewhere, you’ve probably only known or bought and held BTC since the earliest 2015, whereas I have held BTC since mid 2011, which in the grand scheme of things means ��.
@_date: 2018-12-28 19:30:56
Retards spend bitcoins anyway, the fucking irony of everyone saying fiat is worthless, yet the stupid fuckers would rather spend BTC which will be worth more, how the fuck does that figure ����.
Your meant to dump the crap and keep the good.
@_date: 2018-12-27 18:36:18
As I explained to someone earlier, if you understood BTC you’d realise you can buy it in less that a minute from anywhere you have an internet connection.
I’m extremely wealthy I have a fabulous family and a life you could only dream of, be careful who you direct those sayings at.
Anyway get a life is a 90s saying, where have you been? Living under a stone ��.

So is eclair wallet safe?
I mean can you just download it and use it, straight away, hassle free?
And isn’t it on IOS?, I thought IOSs operating system was more secure than androids anyway?.
@_date: 2018-12-27 17:40:37
Please, I can buy BTC in an instant while holding a glass of champagne and balancing a Thai whore on my dick, try harder FFS.
But yes I see your point, no offence meant.
@_date: 2018-12-31 19:50:36
Well there you go, shows overall there’s not a lot of unity in BTC, not enough for it to make a difference IMO.
@_date: 2018-12-27 22:03:39
Yeah it is, except all the people who buy will HODL, you do know that from day one BTC has been manipulated, and that this is its main reasons for it  not being allowed into financial institutions in its broadest term.
Geez, these whales and other crooks manipulate the shite out of it, have your go also, you’ll feel better.
@_date: 2018-12-27 19:19:28
I don’t think anyone can play this market, I think this market plays everyone, make big money when the volatility is there.
I can’t see why any trader wants lower volatility.
But know I’m not here organising a malicious attack, I’m just debating a though.
@_date: 2018-12-28 08:29:24
Your own time zone please, then everyone will follow in theirs.
Can’t think of any other way, but most important is that you also spread this please.
@_date: 2018-12-28 12:51:51
Why am I?
I mean come on, is proof of keys really that hard?
All you have to do is transfer funds of an exchange into a hardware wallet, I can transfer any amount in seconds by scanning a QR code and verifying the transaction.
What the hell has people buying BTC got to do with proof of keys, there is no conflict, it’s all in your head.
Also may I point out your logic is flawed because proof of keys is about showing that exchanges probably don’t have the real amount of BTC, more that they are using some fractional reserve system.
I therefore am putting more pressure on those exchanges by asking people to purchase more BTC before proof of keys date, this will mean they have less in their coffers, as long as a lot of people take part.
I would say I and others that do pump are helping expose them for what they are.
@_date: 2018-12-29 10:58:57
You prefer it over BTC ?
@_date: 2018-12-28 11:46:48
Not really no, I am a backer of proof of keys, I personally have never kept crypto on an exchange, so I believe proof of keys is a good lesson.
All I am doing is trying to get as many people as possible to buy on that date, there is no alter ego or I am not looking for gain, I want a unified buy, by as many people as possible, I would hope all those people would not leave that crypto they buy on an exchange anyway.
Please take part.
@_date: 2018-12-27 18:01:55
I don’t understand the irony though in your words, firstly you admit as we all know that whales coordinate dumps and buys, in other words they have control over a relatively small market.
Yet what I propose is tantamount to a boiler room scam ��‍♂️, I don’t see BTC like you do.
There can only be 21 million as soon as we can dry up supply from or by any means, happy days.
@_date: 2018-12-28 08:26:36
Thank you, yes it will be interesting, buy in your own time zone, and others will hopefully in theirs.
Please spread the word ��������.
@_date: 2018-12-28 19:21:21
Bullshit institution investors, WTF why would an institutional  investor buy into an economy that’s seen nothing but selling, even NAVOGRATZ  has had to dump X amount of BTC because his start up bank shed so much loss this year that even his arse was twitching.
Barclays have scrapped along with others planned trading desks, and have literally no interest from investors they have on their books.
 Numerous hedge fund managers are saying and reporting the same.
BAKKT have postponed as they cannot get the regulation approval off the SEC, because they want to settle in physical BTC and the powers that be want to maintain their grip on the BTC price.
I agree with you, and the simple reason is price, if the price is high they’ll want their part, if the price is low they don’t care.
Even futures contracts are cash settled, BTC cannot grow price wise under these conditions.
@_date: 2018-12-28 19:38:17
It’s nothing more than a white elephant.
@_date: 2018-12-27 20:47:07
Let’s them then.
@_date: 2018-12-28 08:27:33
It will if you don’t join it.
@_date: 2018-12-27 17:28:40
I understand what you are saying but in reality I don’t get that, firstly you can’t make that much because surely because you lose from the tax you have to pay, that alone surely cuts any profit from a small rise right down?
It wouldn’t be the sole intention to pump, more to create less supply, and by everyone holding, keep that supply low for a while.
@_date: 2018-12-27 21:38:22
That’s even better then, if those bots buy also happy days.
@_date: 2018-12-27 10:27:34
You could be right, as they must be making a lot of free money this way, not sure how many people are clients of Coinbase, or how many have actually linked a bank account, but it must be a money maker.
@_date: 2018-12-29 09:37:06
All the comments here have elements of truth, and Andreas also has valid points, especially from a technical view.
“BUT”and there always is one, BTC in my opinion hasn’t got much chance of real success because I cannot see how you’ll stop this speculation and more over how you’ll stop the manipulation.
Regulation and then saying decentralised is a ridiculous statement, there is no point regulating BTC  because cross border protocols can’t be truly regulated.
The same as micro payments, I’ve never in my whole life needed to make a payment that small, I cannot see that being Bitcoins killer app.
And how long will it be in reality before people see BTC as boring, something that’s just not taken off?.
If you think people won’t become tired, you’d be wrong as humans are very fickle, this in many cases is why we consume so much, always searching for something better.

He will be loaded, if he keeps creating coins, and he does.
@_date: 2018-12-31 14:06:13
So basically in a round about the houses way you’ve just replied, and said the same thing I said.
Don’t come back at me with in the future rubbish, everyone has virtually heard of Bitcoins or crypto currencies.
My point is if you look at the price, simply you see SELL, not buy.
They are not buying, and buy now with prices so low they would be savvy enough too.
I won’t even argue what I know is right.
@_date: 2018-12-30 10:22:26
There is no hindsight what so ever, I’ve personally listened to many hedge fund managers that have been saying for over a year, clients have been showing no interest in crypto currency.
And you or anyone should know for what the CME did with futures contracts that regulatory approval is really hard to win.
If you open your eyes and look at the real evidence you don’t need hindsight, hindsight is for those who are slow on the uptake.
@_date: 2018-12-29 10:45:28
Who cares as long as he tales his initial investment out when the price is high enough then he can’t lose.
The point is anyone who invest in crypto should always take their investment money back, when prices allow.
You’d be a fool not too.
@_date: 2018-12-28 07:58:26
Sell then.
@_date: 2018-12-29 14:33:35
Trillion that should be, sorry that’s me rushing,
So yeah it’s massive compared to BTC.
@_date: 2018-12-30 18:26:55
Do you know about online protocols?
Clearly not, as if I would bet some desperado on reddit, over something that means nothing to me either way.
Clearly you’re  some form of scammer, WTF why would anyone engage with you LOL ��.
You need to stick with the main article and put your reasons forwards why you disagree rather than digging for free BTC, I bet you are from a scam city country, desperate for money.
@_date: 2018-12-29 09:39:33
What are you talking about “IDIOT”, hasn’t anyone shown you in life how to direct a question, what is it you are saying?

@_date: 2018-12-28 08:39:04
Basic economics, well you should realise then if you have so many traders in an unregulated market and only 4% of wallets owning most of the Bitcoins then, you’d need to be a miracle worker to ever get the BTC price to be as you put it long term valuable.
They’ll manipulate it everyday so it never becomes that, no main stream traders touch it for these reasons LOL.
Put your hat away and buy some coin on the night you’ll feel better.
@_date: 2018-12-26 08:16:43
Please explain what you mean in more detail.
@_date: 2018-12-27 21:12:44
I think the price would rise a lot more, it would depend who sold as to how low it would drop percentage wise.
Crypto isn’t dead,  it is in bad shape, more selling off than buying for sure.
If you take a big stick and smash a hornets nest there is only one outcome.
@_date: 2018-12-27 21:17:58
Spread the word then, everyone needs to help, friends family and reddit or FB, instagram, all sources should be used.
Let’s do this shit.
@_date: 2018-12-29 10:54:09
You’re  talking crap, basically your view on a country is this, that because a country has a history it must be outdated����, absolutely bizarre, I suppose the UK is outdated also because they are also steeped in history.
Have you proof of millions of Irish owning crypto currency, do you have that data, or are you talking out of your ass, for the sake of it.
I think your brainwashed and disillusioned, I doubt someone as powerful as Rupert murdoch cares a rats ass about Bitcoin ��, sorry but in pissing myself at your comment there.
And yes I do, Gold is an 8 trillion dollar market, Bitcoin is a tiny market, you are not prepared for debate, and your knowledge seems very narrow and limited.

I’m not going to sell for a few dollars rise, it just a coordinated buy, just to see in the new year.
I’m not after dumping anything, just a satisfying thought knowing how many bought on New Years , and I hope we could get everyone, or it would be nice.
@_date: 2018-12-27 21:46:25
Yep let’s do it.
I love a gamble, wouldn’t be here if I didn’t.
@_date: 2018-12-27 16:43:00
 Yes I get that, but this wouldn’t be dumped, it would be genuine buyers who have the intention to hold.
It’s just a scenario, I don’t want shooting for posting this, it’s just interesting.
@_date: 2018-12-27 11:47:45
I just don’t get this post or this question, prey tell what is the difference?
Scanning a QR code is not hard, the only difference I see is, pressing a confirm button on your phone.
Maybe it’s a couple of seconds slower, but is that really a big issue?.

 Number 11, three of the following are closely linked to Bitcoin.

2)Schnorr  signatures.

4) segregated witness.
This is “4”, not “3”.

 No, your the asshole who’s preaching about right and wrong, and bragging about your book reading, college teaching and all the other crap you’ve bored  me with, just pointing out that all you know and all you’re doing is all out of Andreas’s mind,  and  not your own.
If you don’t want to be involved FUCK OFF, it really is that simple, go play elsewhere.
@_date: 2018-12-31 08:10:18
Redid subscriber figures are probably as misleading as all the talk of how well Bitcoin is doing, and how many people are buying Bitcoin.
The only figure you can trust is the Bitcoin price.
Low=death knell.
@_date: 2018-12-28 08:25:24
So do I buy weekly, have done since 2011, it has nothing to do with that or how much anyone buys.
It’s just a fun coordinated buy, I don’t care about the price movement, it’s just interesting to see if people power can move it.
And at the end of the buy we all have more coin, less for others to own, and we have effected supply.
@_date: 2018-12-27 21:55:13
I agree with all you say, apart from I’m not a proponent of spending BTC, I think it’s more valuable than fiat so fiat is what I spend over BTC, but all the rest ����, this would only be an open experiment, and there shouldn’t be a problem taking part.
