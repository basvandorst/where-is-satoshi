Well, they are legit and I bought quite a bit of BTC through them a few years back when it was possible. A lot of hoops to switch currencies though and they are not a good venue to buy BTC - they have supported BTC mostly to allow people to buy L$ with BTC, not the other way around.
The only one that can unlock your account is their support, so try getting to them.

If the borrower does have sufficient collateral, then he has an obligation to return it. That's not the issue; somebody leveled my house (collateral) and stole my paycheck (my trade money), I still have to pay my mortgage. If my house is not leveled, bank takes my house.
The issue with lenders is present only when the borrower has insufficient collateral to return debt. You can't exactly force people to deposit additional funds to pay their debts, so you can't return the whole amount to the lender. You can, though, return the collateral, if it's not stolen as well.
So the lenders are affected, but it would be unfair and contrary to the terms of contract to let traders keep their collateral and put the whole loss on the lenders.

No, you don't get it back. As I kid, I lost my entire savings when a foreign bank branches in my country closed without letting people withdraw their money. The best part is that bank still exists, and countless lawsuits and a few international incidents and arbitrages later, still no money, and it's probably worthless anyway due to fiat inflation.

The same as transactions. Until something knocks him down, it stays there. New ones are more likely to roll off as there's more stuff on the platform; I had three blocks come in short succession and two fell off immediately.

How is Internet public utility when basically all Internet infrastructure is privately owned? ISPs own bandwidth, companies own servers... majority of big websites use Amazon for hosting. Is AWS a public resource?
What "public space" for "free speech" is there that's not in some way owned by a private company, and has a global reach?
Or let me approach that from another side. Do you believe Bitcoin should draft terms of service and implement a way to prevent certain users from using it?

See, now you're the one defaming Alex Jones.
I'll end this here. You've started repeating that platforms are businesses that can kick out anyone who violates their terms. I can only respond with what I already said; platforms such as Facebook are not held liable for data that users publish because they've themselves said they're public place, just like a public square, [when that suits them]( When that doesn't suit them, then they're private businesses. That's called hypocrisy.
@_date: 2018-09-22 20:05:15


I dunno man. The first thing I did when I heard he was banned was to go check why. I wasn't able to find what he said. I went to check the original video, but conveniently, there are no more Alex Jones videos on YouTube. So I can't check. How is this good for anyone? Where are the original quotes? Where are the sources? Why is all this being constantly digested for me, and original information is nowhere to be found?
[Here he explains Sandy Hook and says he didn't say that](
But why is he being banned now? I mean, Sandy Hook was in 2012! That was 7 years ago! However the US is preparing for new election cycle. I remember stories all over the net attributing Trumps victory to Alex Jones, saying he's influencing alt-right voters. And now I see stories that he's some sort of an extremist, conspiracy theory nut, that nobody actually listens to him, that he went too far. Which one is he? Conspiracy theory nut or the voice of alt-right conservatives listened by millions? I don't know. But man, does his "conspiracy theory" sound credible when he gets banned for virtually every US social media there is. And PayPal. You can't convince me that he violated terms on each of these platforms at the same time.




None of that alternatives is widely used. You can't use any of that to buy things on Amazon or any other popular site. I assume you're in the US because you talk about wiring money as an alternative. Yes, perhaps, in the US. Wiring money internationally costs money and is not viable for small purchases. If I want to wire money to Amazon, even if Amazon accepted my wire, I would have to pay 10 EUR for the privilege in my bank, and Amazon would have to pay additional 25 USD to receive it. And you can't do a fork with cheaper transaction fees. :)


While I do agree with you, you do realize that we're talking about Alex Jones being censored, right? If anyone loses a voice, it's censorship, no matter who it is. It's censorship even if we all agree that it's probably better for all that he be silenced. Even if someone is a pedophile, and he wants to talk about pedophilia, he should get a chance to do so. Only after acting it out should he be put in jail.






Whole statement is untrue and biased. He did not act as a thug (he didn't do anything, he was just expressing his opinion whatever he said), he did not just "use a services of a private company" but was using a media platform that has so far avoided any responsibility for content it hosts due to it being "a platform," and if he violated their terms of service I really don't know why it took them 7 years to realize that and suddenly he gets banned from a bunch of platforms. I mean, even YouPorn banned him, WTF?




Can you show me a video where he said that? Or a citation? Maybe you'll have more luck finding that than I did. I linked his denial above.

So you're basically asking the US government to forcibly take the money from the rich in order to keep waging war with the world, and squeezing oil and money from the rest of the world? Yeah, the rich will be delighted, and surely won't simply move their business out of the country, because unlike the poor, they don't have options to shop for the best conditions for them on the global market.
Also, you should move to my country, you'd love it!
The government here just finished nationalizing the largest private conglomerate in the country, largely centered in agribusiness and mostly own by a rich family. To "save jobs and prevent systemic crisis," they basically manufactured an artificial liquidity crisis for the conglomerate, took control over it by writing a new law specifically to do so, siphoned millions from the company through government appointed "consultants," caused economy to dip just as it started recovering, willingly let all national pension funds to take a hit in the process, made US shark funds a lot of money, and sold the majority in the company to Russia and the US. So now instead of the largest company in the country being private company and regional player that brought earnings in the country, along with all banks but one, are owned by foreigners, and all profits they earn is leaking out of the country, as imports are now greater than exports.
Seriously, you'll love it here. Especially if you're a bitcoin miner. Do you mine bitcoin? For everything you mine, you're going to pay 66% tax. That might prevent you from being competitive on a global market, but at least you're not risking to become rich and increase economic inequality.

They can't have it both ways. For years, Facebook has been repeating that it is a tech platform, not a publisher or a media company, in order to avoid responsibility for content they publish. Recently they've been saying the opposite, to justify their censorship of content either they or the US government don't want online.
We're way past the slippery slope. It's either the public beach and nobody can deny you the right to use it, or it's a private beach. If it's a private beach, the owner is responsible for things that happen there. It can't be both.
The situation is especially dire because tech platforms have grown way beyond the borders of their own country. I don't like the fact that the US "tech platform" has the power to choose which political content gets viewed by the majority of eyeballs, and who gets to raise money. How is my government supposed to hold this US "tech platform" accountable without either cutting itself from the Internet, or taking away net neutrality?

That's the crux of it. And here's a better one - can Google (a private company that provides a search service) rightfully ban someone from using their search? When will Google ban Alex Jones from its search results? What's your right to free speech worth when nobody can find out that you're speaking?


What alternatives? Before Bitcoin, what was the alternative to PayPal? There's Visa and Mastercard, there's Amex, and there's PayPal. That's where the customers are. All of them are US companies. US government has control over them and each of those companies would have grave problems if government suddenly declared them illegal or held them liable for anything. All of them share information with US government. If you're, say, Russian or Chinese, what real alternatives did you have before Bitcoin came along? Mind you, Russians and Chinese have healthy amount of skepticism towards their government. That's why Bitcoin thrives there no matter what governments try to do. US people actually believe the propaganda their government throws at them, they actually believe they're the most democratic country in the world.


That's just untrue. What do you think he did? And which rules do you think he violated?

It seems that he did, as he changed his mind, didn't he?


Google is also a business, and they don't owe him inclusion in their search results. Power company is also a business, and they don't owe him power to film his videos. Where is the line here?
I believe that nobody should be prevented from publishing his content, speaking his ideas, and being paid, no matter what he's saying. When you stop fighting with arguments, and start shutting people down, well, as history teaches us, you're well on the way to become repressed state. Sue Alex Jones all you want, but let him speak. Because if you shut him down, you're taking away people's freedom to listen to both sides and make their own judgement about it.




And he got banned from major platforms in July. Why the delay, and then the swift coordinated action?
Also, the parents of victims also sued several rifle makers, the city of Newtown, the Newtown Board of Education, and estate of Nancy Lanza. Why do all of them still have their Facebook pages? Wait, does Remington Arms still have Facebook page because court found them not guilty in that case? Will Facebook and YouTube restore Alex Jones channel if he is found not guilty in the lawsuit? Why didn't Facebook and YouTube wait until the court decided that Alex Jones is guilty? Where's that old saying now, "innocent until proven guilty," and how will the court decide if Jones is guilty of saying what he's been accused of if YouTube has already removed the content before the trial? Can Jones now sue YouTube for tampering with the crime scene? :)))

Wait a second, that's not a failed short squeeze. Somebody sold in order to manipulate the price lower. That failed. Technical term for this is long squeeze - when longs are manipulated into panic selling. Afterwards the price kept climbing. Then shorters had to buy in and close their shorts - which is actual short squeeze, when shorts are squeezed and have to close their positions which causes the price to jump.

This is a kind of shallow reporting that is unfortunately widespread. They are throwing terms such as "insolvent" while the fact is that Danny had personally put additional 2050 BTC of his own money into Neo, BitFunder/WeExchange and Ukyo. The man personally bailed out Bitcoin businesses to make things right, and he didn't owe anybody anything, and still doesn't.
It's actually reverse of what he's being accused of, he put his money into the company instead of stealing money from the company.
But the real story is who made threats to CEO's family and why are financial circles in Cyprus not being questioned about this as the main suspects.

Article mentions that Neo&amp;Bee is insolvent. Title below the photo says that Danny claims that Neo&amp;Bee is insolvent. Insolvent means bankrupt. That's a long shot from "liquidity problems". I mean, putting question mark at the end doesn't mean it's objective reporting. If somebody asked in an article if I was a murderer, yes, they have a right to ask whatever questions they want, but I'd sue for defamation and win with no problems whatsoever.
I wouldn't count on authorities. Authorities fined HSBC with a small fee, but jailed DPR with no problems. But it seems that Bitcoin community is not really bothered about this at all. Well I'm bothered, I don't want to be a part of community that's willing to side with bullies and add to insults, and say "we'll OK, somebody threatened him, they probably had good reasons, who knows what he did wrong that we don't know about."

Circle or Coinbase? We already have BitFinex and BTCJam offering interest on deposits and lending! But we also already have decentralized exchanges and soon we'll have smart property, and with that, simple market forces will raise standards. Depositing money to a third party will probably be present for a long(ish) time, but everybody who can will lend through smart contracts which guarantee that trader he's lending to will get margin called as soon as he can't repay. And if you want to earn interest through lending, will you choose BTCJam-like lending, where you basically can't collect if the borrower defaults, or will you choose smart contract which gives you complete control over borrower's car if he defaults, and where you can order that car to drive itself to you when that happens?
We have a lot of players looking to reinvent traditional banking services inside cryptocurrencies. If I were a bank, I'd be researching Bitcoin furiously at this point and drafting new models to stay relevant. And many of them do, although most are sluggish as all big organizations are. In essence, what we have is a new market, early players which grow and swallow old industry (or get bought by old industry), old industry rapidly shrinking and survivors becoming more effective, and at one point which nobody really notices the tipping point is behind us.
I might be an optimist, but I believe government and bank money-printing is slowly but inevitably coming to an end. Not soon, and not soon enough, but sooner than we imagine.

Yes, if you move it out of the blockchain (and with decentralized exchanges, this is becoming less and less likely by the minute). But when you have it in your wallet, your coins are fractional-reserve-proof. This is also the main difference between Bitcoin and commodities - Bitcoin ecosystem is for the most par set up so that you hold your bitcoins; with commodities, especially gold and the like, someone else often holds it for you.

It turns out I finished first, which I didn't expect, especially as I wasn't in the first 10 initially. I expected to possibly win some money when all cheater scores are reduced, but not the first place, as I expected at least you to finish above me based on our conversation here. My score was not modified.
Maybe you were identified as somebody's fake account. But how the heck did you manage 81K without cheating?
I'm also a bit surprised that T.W. is still in top ten. T.W. and M.S. are the only ones from most recent top ten during the contest left in the new top ten, with scores significantly reduced. But it's not that far fetched that they made money aside from transferring between accounts, and I have great respect for at least two bots (or one bot with two different trading patterns), they were worthy opponents and whoever was behind them is very good.

Good questions!
He is CEO until another CEO takes over. I don't know what people are mad for, but I've seen a bunch of people crying wolf and calling it all a scam without any arguments. Maybe it's FUD to get cheap shares (halting trading was the smart thing to do in that case). Maybe it's simply attack against Bitcoin itself. Perhaps it's smear campaign from Cyprus financial industry. Or a few Internet loonies. Who knows. But I haven't seen any evidence of foul play on Danny's part.
He has equity in business, and he planned to borrow more money to the company and/or raise additional money, but he exhausted his own liquidity. This is normal (actually typical) for a startup. Nothing shady. He even took losses himself instead of Neo with things he didn't have control of (like BitFunder and MtGox), and he got involved personally to fix other's screwups.
The guy worked relentlessly to create a company and fix Bitcoin screwups. And what's the first thing that comes to your mind? Sure, he did some good things, he must be a cheat, let's lynch him.

Yes, of course, but I had to be a bit imprecise to fit it in the single line. It's also owned by more than one person when in case of exchanges and similar legal entities in case of simple single-sig wallet. :)

You are spot on.
I'm afraid though that this is not just a few random jerks. Somebody went to great lengths to discredit Neo and Danny personally. I've seen this kind of destructive attack before, it's easy to discredit someone without any proof whatsoever. It is rooted deeply in human psychology and it almost never fails; Danny is given the choice to either be the martyr or get out and let his cause fail. That is, unless Bitcoin community chooses to stand behind him and not let such things happen again.

It's possible but the system actively discourages it, unlike with fiat where it's the way the system works. I strongly believe that we'll soon see decentralized exchanges where such non-transparencies will not be possible, and that centralized exchanges will very quickly either become very very transparent or die off simply because they won't be competitive enough. Who wants to store his money with centralized exchange and bear additional risk that centralized exchange (or any party) will engage in fractional reserve landing when there are other options out there?

You're right. Without fake accounts bouncing money back and forth between them, there would be very little trading going on. I know for sure that most of my trades were with fake accounts, and at least 3 accounts from the top 10 were the same person. Most likely more.
On the other hand, who knows; if there were no fake accounts moving money through spread, which held the price constant, maybe there would be a strong incentive to push the price up and down and we'd see more "real" trading going on.
I finished 13th. Congratulations on the prize, whatever you get. If you're in the top 10 now your real position will most likely be higher when it's calculated. :)

His issue is with price and scams. I think he's basically saying that he doesn't understand and approve how stocks and markets work by creating bubbles and violently parting people from their money. Alas, this is how things work and how beachhead is created, and it is the effective distribution and redistribution vehicle for a new currency.
If someone thinks that people getting scammed and scared into giving up on their early investments is bad, just think about how the path for every fiat currency through history was paved with real blood and physical violence. Just look at USD and how many young Americans die to defend its exchange rate every year.

It's not that they are not using BTC, they are. It's just that between your deposit, and your withdrawal, it's their BTC, not yours.
You only have MtGoxBTC, CircleBTC, and CoinBaseBTC in the meantime - and don't get me wrong, those numbers on your screen are worth something, after all, you can exchange them for BTC or fiat, most of the time. But sometimes you can't and they suddenly become worth much less than real BTC, as MtGox survivors can testify.
Contrast that with, say, Blockchain.info where you're in complete control of your money all the time, since you posses your private key. What they and similar services are doing is not actually possible in classic banking industry, simply because there was never a thing such as Bitcoin that enables it.

I remember years ago there was actually no way to actually buy Bitcoin in my country, and the mining was not an option as ASICs were expensive (and had to be pre-paid for a chance of eventually getting one sometime in the future). And as of merchants accepting Bitcoin, you could buy drugs or socks. So, realistically, it is a big improvement.
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:30:11
I'll just comment on shorts, as I agree on the rest.
If you short-sell a reasonably big amount, say 5K BTC, you can push the market down for about $20 yourself, and then the market will react and go down some more (as this would kill the current rally). Then you re-buy at the botom with a limit order, or at dips, which doesn't move market up or moves it up very little. And there you are, you've sold and bought the same amount of bitcoins, but the price is down considerably.
Of course, at some point of such sudden moves people rush to buy as they consider bitcoin undervalued. But that kind of sentiment is almost always short-lived, and that's why for a really big player accumulating and selling immediately vs. longer period is a powerful weapon.
Hopefully Bitcoin has become a large enough market for market forces to kick in and enable it to live through that sort of manipulation by a single player. Also, hopefully Bitcoin incentives are set correctly to push back against current merchant and miner incentives to sell and trader's incentive to short which are at play ATM.
@_date: 2015-01-15 18:47:22


I'm not so sure. It could still fail, but with the passage of time this becomes less and less likely. What I was saying though is that buying all Bitcoin is not a feasible way to kill it and it would backfire, even if it could be done. I agree with basically everything else you said though.


You buy them back as you have to return them as you've borrowed them. But if you do it properly, now they're worth less, even counting in that buy, and you've made some profits. As the price falls, slowly and relentlessly, you've done your damage and spread FUD. Bitcoin needs bubbles to spread.

Why do you think that somebody would destroy bitcoin by buying them all (which you can't) and making them worth a lot? That doesn't make any sense.
You destroy Bitcoin by only way you can, by killing adoption, if that's even possible at this point. On the legal front, you introduce regulation and make it as hard as possible to legally buy bitcoin, and hinder adoption through finance industry. On the market front, you short the hell out of it (and even make money in the process).
But you can't do the first without killing your local Bitcoin businesses and moving Bitcoin to other countries. And you can't do the latter easily on the free market - if it worked then arguably free markets don't.
But note that the bearwhale could have at one point brought the Bitcoin price to 0; his order was actually bigger than the whole ask orderbook on Bitstamp. That's just one exchange, and most certainly just for the short time, but think about it, what would be the public reaction to headlines saying "BITCOIN WORTHLESS: bitcoin markets heavily manipulated; one man drops bitcoin price to $0?"

That statement is reaction from 2007 and refers to one of the early D-Wave prototypes so it is completely obsolete now, even if by "modern cell phone" he referred to the first iPhone which was also introduced in 2007. A lot has happened in 8 years, and D-Wave scaled their chip from 28 qubits to 2048 qubits in the meantime.
For the newer study regarding D-Wave speed, [this one]( is more current. Here's the relevant part:


And to quote from [a referenced paper]( itself:


computationally relevant quantum tunneling has been
a subject of substantial debate. This debate has now
been settled in the affirmative with a sequence of publications
[6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 18, 21] demonstrating that quantum
resources are present and functional in the processors.

The number of possible combinations is so big that such a database would be impossibly huge, not to mention that filling it up would take impossibly huge amount of time as you'd have to calculate hash for every possible block that can be generated.
Now, to put this in perspective, the number of atoms in known universe is about 10^80, which means that you need [about 266 bits]( for the number of possible combinations to exceed the number of atoms in the known universe. Bitcoin block is up to 1 MB, which is 8000000 bits, about 30000 times more than the number of atoms in the known universe. And that's just scratching the surface, since block is not always exactly 1 MB, you also have to account for all blocks that are shorter as well, which increases a possible number of combinations to a number that's totally impossible to compare to anything we can comprehend.
@_date: 2016-01-11 05:44:32
I don't get this constant berating of D-Wave by the so-called "people in the industry" - D-Wave approach is just one approach, and the commercial interest behind it has advanced quantum research much more than usual academic research has. If quantum research is left to academia alone, it will take hundreds of years to get QC to mainstream.
Have you seen [this]( BTW? It links Google research paper which shows that D-Wave approach gives results. And D-Wave research papers are not that hard to find, for example I found [this one]( with one quick Google search.

Technically you're correct, it is not a Turing complete machine, in a sense that it can solve any problem a normal non-quantum computer can. But than again, it was never meant to be. You use it to solve specific types of problems that benefit from quantum effects, just like you use your GPU or Bitcoin ASIC miner for a very specific purpose which it excels at.

After adoption curve levels out, I deem it much less significant than inflation of fiat currencies. After all, bitcoin inflation is largely over, and deflation is already in effect, and it should be relatively stable force from now on.

You're not looking far enough in the future. What's more volatile, the politics and economy of each state, or the global currency over which nobody has much control?
@_date: 2018-10-08 11:22:48
You joke, but being a global currency, bitcoin is stablecoin in the making, unlike state currencies which will always be volatile because they depend on politics. Its price is already largely decoupled from any government actions; political shenanigans preformed by the China, US or Russia are no longer felt on the price like they used to. India banned bitcoin-related payments through banks in July. Effect on bitcoin price? Up 0.05%.
A single exchange can no longer influence the price like it used to. Traders don't care about a single exchange anymore, and exchanges have ways to at least partially compensate losses, or simply move their business from one country to another, like Chinese and Indian exchanges did.
Personally, I'm waiting for people to realize that bitcoin really is a stablecoin, and that state currencies are actually volatile and rapidly depreciating because of inflation. Granted, bitcoin bubbles are still largely driven by explosions of adoption and speculation, but with time, as adoption curve levels out, it will be easy to see that it's not bitcoin price that is volatile. It will be state currencies that will be measured by how much they've fallen against bitcoin. Because that's what is happening in the background. Now that there's a true measure for the first time in the history, state currencies have been weighted against bitcoin, they have been measured, and they have been found rapidly depreciating.

They didn't steal anything. They got hacked for about 36% of funds (not 70% - where did you get 70%?). How was the token fake, when it was repaid in full?
I was using Bitfinex at a time and I got more than compensated because I didn't trust scaremongers like you and sold my debt. If you didn't use Bitfinex at the time, stop saying that people like me lost something when we didn't. The people who sold their debt, well, they're the ones who chose that option and they were lucky to have that option. MtGox users, for example, never had that option.
I don't get why people are constantly attacking Bitfinex for giving them options to recover their funds. What should have they done when they got hacked, shat gold bricks at their customers? They handled it admirably given the situation. Interestingly, people who complain the loudest seem to have lost no money. Stop generating FUD when there is none.

Please have in mind that continuous rate of payment is nothing new. You have this on your mobile phone plan (pay by minute or even second), or on your Internet plan if you pay by megabyte instead of paying flat rate. Then you settle once a month, or fill'er'up when you spend all your credit.
Continuous payment you're talking about is just automating the settlement as well. It's the equivalent of having automatic recurring transaction / payment order to settle your mobile or Internet bill.
The question is - do you want to give your phone/Internet provider access to your funds - as you give to say, PayPal, and basically automate this payment. And you can do this today without any crypto. This is not a killer app, just a thing crypto perhaps makes a bit easier as it's more fluid than old-school payments.

That's what any money is. By entering a work contract, you sell your hours or the work done for a rate of your choosing. Then you get paid in chunks of time because every payment has to be verified by the human (because employer wants to have some control over this and verify that the work was indeed done).
What would be the improvement in the system you're proposing? You're just adding another unit (LaborCoin) to be converted to (and from), but it's just a unit for expressing how much your hour is worth. You can get that at any time today by simply dividing your paycheck by the number of hours you work for it. You can do this by the minute if you wish.
You can't account for your time in blockchain; or to be more precise, you can record it , but that involves extra manual work with no decentralization benefits. Typically accounting for time worked is done by the hour because shorter units of time simply take too much administration on the part of employee (which is billed as well) and employees don't typically want to verify each minute of your time as it eats their time as well. So recording it in blockchain doesn't mean much unless this record is "signed" by both employee and employer. Which is implicitly done in typical paycheck already. Third party (miner) has no way to verify this lest he does some sort of audit which is again expensive and not done automatically.
You can pay for the services rendered (instead of for the time done) and verify delivery in some way; this is the way smart contracts are going but it doesn't actually need whole new cryptocurrency.
So the question is, what's the improvement LaborCoins bring - I can't actually find any?
@_date: 2017-04-16 12:46:13
Indeed, this is why audit is essential. That would prove that they're not operating fractional reserve.
But I don't find it that implausible. They did have a legal defense fund and they were open about it, and they were lucky to have a few record-breaking months which can be clearly seen by the volume on the exchange.
And watching BnkToTheFuture investors, as the future of Bitfinex became more probable in the past quarter, the increase in token redemptions was significant in the end. They had one big existing investor buying $8359933 in tokens on March 10th, and the number of small investors increased by 20% in the last week of campaign alone. That makes sense to me, less risk, and people are more willing to convert, and that was the primary reason why they were able to convert that much tokens now.
@_date: 2019-04-25 19:31:31
If it was an inside job, I wish there were more of those. People who had money on Bitfinex and got a haircut, and just held BFX tokens, got their money back in full. People who converted to equity, now have shares that are worth 7.5 times the original lost amount and paid handsome dividends. Both, if they didn't sell RRT tokens, stand to get another compensation on top of that in case the stolen money is repossesed (they already got a small symbolic compensation due to some money being seized by cops).
The only people who lost money were those who thought it was "inside job" and sold compensation tokens at the lowest price. But hey, even they got to limit their risk and exit when they wanted. Compare this with MtGox where nobody still got compensated for anything.
@_date: 2016-02-20 11:39:11
Well, if you define the problem as "how do you decrease payment/bills periods so that people can leave with as little money in the bank as possible" then crypto is not the solution, smaller billing periods are, and crypto is not though it can help to facilitate this somewhat as it can ease payment automation. If you take your mobile plan, you're probably already paying by the minute and it's nothing new.
If you define the problem as "how do you have as much runway as possible" or in other words "how to increase the amount of time I can keep my standard of living with my income cut off" then the solution is saving and budgeting, and decentralizing and/or increasing your income. Which has nothing to do with crypto.

Why are you so sure that WoW gold is not taxable?
I don't know about the IRS, but in Europe, since ECB published their "[Virtual Currency Schemes]( report in October 2012, Bitcoin is labeled as "virtual currency" together with WoW gold, Linden dollars from Second Life, and different loyalty programs (like miles from Miles &amp; More).
**As most regulators in EU don't make any distinctions between different types of "virtual" currencies, this means that gold mining in WoW or earning miles can, indeed, be interpreted as taxable income.** I've asked for clarification from tax administration in my country over this a while back, but not yet received response yet.
The whole "virtual currencies" formulation is a cuckoo's egg slipped in by the central banks; at first, gaming currencies were "virtual" as a way of saying that it's not "real" money even though even WoW gold, yet alone crypto, is as good money as any money issued by central banks. Even if WoW gold is used in simulated environment, it's still stored on servers in a database just like fiat money, and it can be used to buy things.
Then it became a whole new economy and now countries are scrambling to tax it left and right. Well they have to decide - if it's virtual, what is there to tax, and if it's real, why are they calling it virtual? Furthermore, if you're taxing cryptocurrencies, dear governments, does that mean that we'll have to report and pay capital gain taxes on Pokemons when our kids collect them in some game, and when earning miles or different loyalty discounts?
I'm watching with anticipation how taxmen will find a way to get out of this hole they've dug out for themselves. In the end, they will either have to constantly classify and re-classify every game or crypto currency there is, or simply classify whole bunch as money. And then there comes the next logical step, where people start to realize that state currencies are just numbers in a centralized databases, and we all know what are the risks of keeping your money in a centralized exchange or database.

So I think you're pretty safe even if you weren't able to check the source.

Here's [the link to the Forbes Bitcoin article]( Three days after the article, Bitcoin actually achieved parity with the Euro.
And then in June 2011, there was the famous [Gawker Silk Road article]( which brought price to $31.91 and four days later caused US senators Charles Schumer and Joe Manchin [to urge FBI to shut down Silk Road]( spotlighting Bitcoin as the only way of payment on illegal market.
This chain of events led to US government looking into Bitcoin, and ultimately the Department of Homeland security seizing MtGox's Wells Fargo and Dwoilla accounts on May 9th and 15th 2013. This left MtGox without $5 million in customer funds. The reason for this was, I suspect, because MtGox was the biggest exchange where people got their bitcoins for spending on Silk Road, although it was done under pretense of MtGox allegedly not giving correct info in some money transmitter forms filed in the US.
My personal theory was that MtGox solvency problems actually started in May 2013 due to the seized accounts. can you confirm or deny that this was the case?

Haven't thought of that. It seems that gadgets can execute any ActiveX control, and through that read and write any file user account can. So after installing, Windows basically trusts them just like it trusts any other application, so it would certainly be possible to read wallet.dat and send it to remote location. Of course, the code that does that should be visible to anyone that bothered to look at it, but you can write gadgets in C# or VB which would obfuscate the code a bit. Securing wallet.dat is definitely not a bad idea. :)

Please check my [comment]( above. It means literally "by decree" - nobody decreed that bitcoin is worth anything; market came to consensus that it has value.

"A few" is much much better than the only alternative there is today, which is "one." We can quibble about how much decentralization is enough, but the fact is that Bitcoin IS decentralized is the major game changer.
* [Top 4 pools each have 15-20% of network]( at the moment, none of them more than that. That's, in my view, acceptable.
* This subreddit has what, 10 moderators? There is only one person (I think), Theymos, that is both moderator here and on Bitcointalk forum. But the fact that robot is following 17 different communities, and the ease with which new communities like can be created by anyone speaks volumes IMO.
* GitHub disagrees. With 5350 forks it's [unable to display fork network]( and it helpfully says that "Woah, this network is huge! We’re showing only some of this network’s repositories." on the [members page]( Also, there are 330 contributors, and [it can be seen]( that 14 people have more than 50 commits, and 34 people more than 10 commits. It's not like we're talking only about 5 developers total. Just for comparison, Linux has 10772 forks and 193 authors, while Bitcoin has 5350 forks and 23 authors. Your typical open source project has much, much less.

Well, not really, bitcoin is actually the exact opposite of fiat money. Latin origin of fiat is "let it be done," in a sense that somebody decrees that something can be used as money. With bitcoin, there is no single centralized authority that decides whether it has value or not. In that sense, bitcoin is more like gold and other currencies that came before fiat was invented; people come to consensus between them that it's actually valuable and can be used as money.
@_date: 2018-04-29 12:04:45
Canine teeth or conch shells are not fiat money, they are commodity money. To have fiat money, money "by decree," somebody has to decree that it's worth something. All fiat money in the world has some sort of entity, central bank or government, behind it. Check [Wikipedia definition](
Fiat money has been defined variously as:
* Any money declared by a government to be legal tender.
* State-issued money which is neither convertible by law to any other thing, nor fixed in value in terms of any objective standard.
* Intrinsically valueless money used as money because of government decree.
* An intrinsically useless object that serves as a medium of exchange (also known as fiduciary money.)
In which of those four categories do you think bitcoin falls in? I can't see how it falls into any of them.

is what you get when people have negative emotional attachment to Bitcoin. They feel strongly about Bitcoin but try to rationalize their feelings by hanging with people with same worldview. They bought Bitcoin and lost money on it, or never bought but wanted to, or they don't like something about it, and now they hang with people that share the same worldview and make fun of it as they need to keep the pretense that they're emotionally detached when they actually are not. It feels empowering to sit on the sidelines and make fun of something. "Make world better by educating fanboys." Yeah, right - if they were emotionally detached they wouldn't invest time in criticizing Bitcoin.
It's actually a quite common phenomenon and most of the things that are controversial have such anti-movements. For example, anti-abortion activists which are trying to "save mothers from committing mistakes which they will later regret." It's just fanboyism/evangelism in reverse, crossing that thin line between educating others and simply reinforcing your worldview by forcing it onto others.

My bank charges $0.30 for domestic transfer, and combined SWIFT charges for international transfer to, say, USA, end up being around 12 EUR on my side and about $25 on the receiver side depending on the bank. USA banks charge arm and leg for SWIFT transfers.

You have first world problems and no idea.
My bank will charge me 20 times current median BTC fee when I pay my bills. And only 10 times when the company I'm paying to has the account in the same bank. That's in addition to charging me money for simply having an account. And I'm in Europe.
But that's not even the real use case. Real use case is international, borderless payments. If I want to send money to somebody in USA, I'll end up paying fixed fee of about 10 EUR + 25 USD, for any amount.
Complete blocksize debate is so first world problem I can't even begin to describe. People are willing to wait weeks and pay 30% of sent amount simply to be able to send money at all.

This is very good argument.
However don't forget that your argument is highlighting only one aspect as well. What about difficulty? Fees increase with larger blocks, but the more fees are worth, the more miners there are competing for those fees. Increase in difficulty alone can basically totally negate the increase in fiat worth of total fees in the day from your table, which means you're missing one of the two variables in your calculation. Depending on difficulty, your calculation is either to the point or irrelevant from the viewpoint of individual miner. Bigger pie with bigger amount of slices multiplies, offsets or completely reverses all those gains.

US government is trying to protect Bitfinex customers who had money on Bitfinex while they were still dealing with US citizens. They are trying to do that by seizing their money, which Bitfinex then refunded with a loan from Tether, secured by collateral in equity. Happily, thanks to Bitfinex, all US customers got their money, even though US government is still doing their best to protect them by still holding the said money.

This is one extremely condescending and disrespectful interview.
I'm all for tough questions and frank discussion, and Amanda held her own admirably, but this is not how you treat a guest. Shame on you Chris and Josh.
In several instances they ask a question that Amanda doesn't know as it's too technical for her; after noting that she's not a programmer she tackles the question anyway. And then they disregard her completely valid answer not by presenting counter-arguments, but by brushing it off saying that she herself said that she's not an expert and whatever she says thus doesn't count. She might not be (why did you ask her in the first place then?), but she gave you a counter argument - instead of an ad hominem attack, the least you should do is actually respond to a counter argument!
It's a shame really, I feel that unlike most of the crypto coverage both hosts have sufficient knowledge to cover things in depth, but really need to brush up on basic journalism skills and stop using the show to smear their prejudices over the guests. That's not being open-minded, that's just being a dick.
@_date: 2019-05-02 16:25:23
Of course they can, legally. At one point US government prohibited people from owning gold, so there's certainly a precedent.
Can they do it successfully is entirely different question though. Some countries have tried and failed. I don't know of a country that has succeeded. [For example]( "Egypt’s Dar al-Ifta, the primary Islamic legislator in Egypt, has issued a religious decree classifying commercial transactions in bitcoin as haram (prohibited under Islamic law)." Here's a link to [LocalBitcoins volume chart for Egypt](
On to your next question, is that against freedom - of course it is. It's also against your freedom to be fist-fucked by a fat TSA lady when entering US. Neither US, nor anyone else cares about your freedom.
Can you fight it - yes you can, in various ways, most of which won't bear any fruit. There were some who, for example, fought for their freedom to not pay taxes. And while some did actually [win]( others [were not so lucky](
Of course the US government has little to gain from stopping people from using Bitcoin. They already declared that crypto income is taxable, and thus endorsed crypto. Even though less and less people are actually reporting it each year due to insane reporting requirements.

Citing someone off the record in newspaper article would be a completely unprofessional. CNB is pretty strict about what information they give out as each thing they say influences a lot of capital and they have track record of staying out of usual Croatian political nonsense. I don't think they'll ever go against ECB recommendations, which is actually good in this case. But we probably also can't expect much further progress regarding concrete bookkeeping and tax guidelines.

It's actually very nice and precise assessment. ECB document is very well written and realistic (Germans wrote it after all, and they are very Bitcoin friendly), and I like the fact that their view is available since 2012 and not fear-based as official policies from USA and China were.
I actually think that Croatia is a good example of how adoption in Europe will go for most countries in Europe, they will simply use ECBs view, and although there will surely be many policy battles in the future, the fact that we have USA, China and Europe basically accepting Bitcoin and keeping regulation minimal makes every other country harder to oppose it. This is, I think, the most significant take from this CNB official comment in Croatia.

1. Journalists asked CNB for official comment, and CNB gave official comment. I doubt that any individual from CNB would give unofficial comments, and if he did, they would have mentioned his name. So this is as official as it can get, apart from CNB doing a press conference on Bitcoin.
2. CNB did refer to ECB opinion and existing Croatian laws and regulation. They could do more, as Cyprus is trying to do, but after all, it would be unwise going against ECB, especially as we're in EU for less than 6 months. This statement, however, does make it very unlikely that CNB will fight Bitcoin or make it illegal - and this is a big deal.
3. HRK is the official currency in Croatia, just as the US dollar is official currency in USA. Please note though that every company that conducts business in Croatia issues a significant amount of invoices in EUR, since foreigners can't buy HRK and then pay in HRK outside Croatia. CNB made a very precise statement that Bitcoin is not currency and is transacted on the Internet, and not on Croatian territory. It is yet to be seen what exactly this means in practice, but my interpretation is that those two things basically enable Croatian merchants to sell something for bitcoins both online and offline, something that is very different for normal currencies. For example, if you're selling something online, your "shop" is in Croatia, your acquiring bank is in Croatia, and customer who is paying by credit card is considered to be on Croatian territory, and thus merchant MUST issue invoice in HRK, not in EUR or some other currency. If Bitcoin is not a currency, and is transacted "on the Internet", that regulation probably doesn't apply.

It's not a barrier to entry. It's a barrier to exit fiat currencies.
I didn't have any problems earning, spending and investing my bitcoins. I only had problems moving fiat to exchange, and moving fiat from exchange to my fiat account. It's important to realize that the inflated fees that are chipping away your money are the exact problem Bitcoin is solving - you're paying for regulation, intermediary fees and national and international money transfer fees.

There is a possibility that the journalist made it all up, or that the person in CNB was speaking off the record, but why would they do that? In my personal experience CNB employees are very careful with public statements, and the journalists... well, this is business newspaper, not some tabloid. I understand your skepticism, but you're not actually basing it on anything other than your feeling and not trusting the journalist. Maybe you can try contacting him and asking for source?

Croatia is a big travel destination, and I think it's not unrealistic to see at least some small renters accepting Bitcoin next season.

It's not a big deal for Bitcoin, but it's a big deal for you and me and anyone else using Bitcoins in Croatia. This means all sorts of things, that we can buy or sell bitcoins legally, gives us leverage when banks give us trouble transferring money, and gives a framework on how this will be taxed and so on. And especially, it's a big deal for anyone in Croatia who accepts or wants to accept Bitcoins.

OK, to sum it up - journalist asked CNB for opinion, CNB gave it. We don't have the copy of original statement.
You do realize that whatever it was, it was a statement given by somebody in CNB who has the authority to comment in the name of CNB, and that it was not given lightly? Do you think that the specifics of a way statement was delivered and who signed it changes the meaning and the message, or that it was misquoted by the newspaper?

As I never logged in, I'm receiving money immediately after each bet (winnings are paid back to the address that sent the bet).

They do seem to be a bit slow with user support though - hope they sort it out and you get your money.

He's working on every company reporting every salary to tax authorities anyway, and he already has report of every sale in the country through fiscalization. He doesn't particularly care in which currency the sale happened, EUR, HRK or XBT, as long as you report it.

Regretfully, I must disagree. Although the CNB announcement is very proactive (in a sense that they made it at all), they are simply echoing ECB, and I doubt they will take any progressive position on Bitcoin besides acknowledging it.
There is simply not enough adoption in Croatia for this to be any sort of movement. A few merchants are accepting Bitcoin, there are some miners I know of, and we have two projects in Bitcoin space - [BitKonan exchange]( and my own [MyBitcoins Windows gadget]( but all of this is just a few individuals and outliers.

Sites that offer payment in several currencies are nothing new. You were right to refund transaction in BTC. You are a shop, not an exchange, and refunds in another currency might raise a bunch of legal and accounting questions (for example, is it a refund or a compensation, is your business registered for this and so on).
If your customer had problems with that he could have paid in some other, less volatile currency. However, it would be smart to have a disclaimer about exchange rates somewhere on the site.
And if you want to be a same smartass as your customer obviously is, you can ask him would he rather have you wait with the BTC refund for a week or so until the exchange rate is the same as when he bought. ;)

I had the opposite experience, I made 24 bets with them and they paid out each and every time (apart from the 3 times I lost). Twice I had a problem with bet not registering on time and user support came through and refunded me manually. I didn't sign up though so I can't comment on withdrawals, but payouts do. From my experience, they sometimes have problems just like any other site.
