This is patently false:  (search: "hard fork") 
@_date: 2016-08-29 21:08:51
From here: 
I wanted to point out that hard-forks are very disruptive to markets. They are disruptive to merchants, to markets, to entire ecosystems. We have to take this into account. Unless there is an overwhelmingly strongly justified reason to do a hard-fork, then the costs outweigh the benefits. We have been looking at ways to solve these problems in Bitcoin without having a hard-fork. This has been a huge focus of our engineering work over the last several years. We have been working on ways to make everyone happy in the ecosystem [although we are not maximizing happiness].
Also, yes I have been writing code for the hard-fork. It's not ready at the moment but I do want you to know that I have been honoring that commitment and have been writing code towards that.
Regardless of whether we have reached a broad consensus on a hard-fork, based on the recent Ethereum hard-fork experience, a Bitcoin hard-fork would inevitably take place. At some point in the future, it's bound to happen. Based on the ethereum hard-fork and experience, they believe that the hard-fork for splitting Bitcoin is inevitably bound to happen.

Copied Kraken's response from below: 
"Interac deposit fees for Kraken and Quadriga are the same at 1.5% ($5 min). Cavirtex charges at least 2.5% ($25 on the max deposit amount of $1,000). With Kraken your Interac deposits are credited immediately so you can start trading right away. EFT deposits and withdrawals (takes 3-5 days) are free with Quadriga right now. Cavirtex charges a flat $7.5 for deposits, $10 for withdrawals. Kraken charges 1.5% for deposits, 1% for withdrawals (max $75).
Kraken trading fees are by far the lowest:
Kraken 0.1% to 0.35%
Quadriga 0.5%
Cavirtex 0.3% to 0.8%
It depends on your trading style which exchange is the best in terms of fees. Active traders who typically trade the funds in their account many times over before withdrawing will do better with Kraken because of the much lower trading fees."

I made my investment in CoinTerra at a time when Avalon, ASICMINER and Butterfly Labs ruled the mining market—the latter being the only one with a phone number. 
I'm by no means saying CoinTerra is perfect, but so far they have delivered 8 petahash/s worth of miners to the Bitcoin network (+/- 15% of total). I'd venture to say that this is a valuable contribution.

I think your comparison runs short, in that in the examples you give the cars and the fitness club equipment all belong to the owners. The customer is only borrowing the equipment or buying a right to access at certain times. 
Also, the damage in the case of a bank run is much greater than just "not being able to get into the bank on a given day" (which is the damage you compared it to with the shared cars and fitness centre examples). Even if 90% of funds are kept in reserve and there is a bank run, then the last people who show up to withdraw their funds, get nothing back - zero. They have lost the total amount of savings held at bank X.    
When I deposit my money at a bank, I would not agree if the banker argues that this money is now his (that would only be possible under a loan contract, not under a deposit contract) - already in classical Roman and Greek times this distinction was clearly made.   
A just (in the natural law sense of the word) way to engage in fractional reserve banking would be to call the contract an investment-gambling scheme, and to give the customers a voucher in return with, say, a 98% chance on winning 3% per year, and a 2% chance of losing the entire investment over that time period.

Plato14, I don't appreciate your ad hominems. If you wish to question my integrity, please do so in a civil manner.
Yes I have spoken positively about CoinTerra the company in the past (see [here]( 
That said, I've never 'pumped' bitcoin mining as investment. If anything, I've always cautioned people to not get involved with more than a small part of their bitcoin portfolio. I've also continuously stressed the importance of diversification.  
Here's a [comment]( I made in August 2013: *"So what is the investor to do? I would argue that the best strategy is to adopt what all wise investors in traditional markets do: diversify. If you cannot afford multiple mining rigs in the current environment, I think it is better to buy a stock or cloud hashing contract in a diversified mining operation."*    
Furthermore, anyone who has seen the mining industry from the inside (I have a little, during august/early september) will acknowledge that the business climate since the second half of 2013 has been insanely competitive there. KNC, BFL, HashFast, CoinTerra, ... : all have been in an unprecedented race during which very complex engineering processes are compressed into periods up to six times shorter than normal, building a type of machine that nobody (except BFL) in these teams had ever built before. In such a climate, it is not strange that time and performance estimates are off by a certain margin. 
I side with [Jez San's comments]( about CoinTerra's best efforts to deliver quality products. 
And here's [a post]( from Bitcoin core developer Gregory Maxwell on his experience as a CoinTerra customer.

The question is here: do you as an investor have the right to withdraw your money at any given time? (on demand) 
If yes, and the 'bank' has fractional reserves, then you are active in a gambling operation. 
If no, and your money is unavailable to you for a fixed amount of time after which you can retrieve it with interest, then you have engaged not in a deposit but in a loan. That is what traditional business banking was all about, the banker was a middleman between entrepreneurs looking for capital, and savers looking for a return on their capital. 
TL;DR: The distinction between the deposit (money remains immediately available, ownership stays with depositor) and the loan (money is unavailable for fixed period, ownership moves to third party) is crucial in this discussion

If the fractional reserve bank is transparent about its practices, then the contractual relationship you have with it is no longer that of a depositor - storage company. Rather, it's closer to that of a gambler and the lottery he bought a ticket from. Which is fine, but it would be confusing to keep calling this 'banking'.

Global Payments chief looks to stay ahead of the curve
By Jane Cooper | Published: 01 April, 2014 
Global Payments processes $1bn in card payments a day in countries all over the world. In a field of rapid innovation, what does chief executive Jeffrey Sloan see as the future of payments?
For the average consumer, Global Payments is probably one of the biggest payments companies they have never heard of. Shoppers may be familiar with the logos branded on their credit cards, but what happens after they give the plastic to the retailer is often a mystery. It is companies such as Global Payments that sit behind the transactions and enable the processing of billions of consumer payments every year.
The company does as its name suggests – global payments – processing more than 6 billion transactions a year and about $1bn a day in countries all around the world. It has grown in recent years through acquisitions, such as the purchase of HSBC Merchant Services – the merchant acquiring division of HSBC – in 2009.
As a processor of so many types of payments, the company has to be able to support whatever payment form retailers and consumers demand, and also anticipate payments trends. When it comes to innovation, Jeffrey Sloan, president and chief executive of Global Payments, says there is a pattern: “Every now and again there is a plateau and then there is a renaissance.” The consumer payments world is now experiencing such an explosion of new ideas and possibilities because of mobile devices, he says. “It is changing how people pay at the point of sale.”
In the UK, for example, the company processes the transactions behind Intuit Pay, a service that allows smaller merchants to accept card payments with a smartphone or tablet. Such innovations have opened up a new market. Previously many small businesses, which often relied on cash or cheques, chose not to accept card payments because it was too costly for them to open a merchant account with their bank and pay the transaction fees for a relatively small volume of payments. Now with solutions such as Intuit Pay, and also iZettle and Square – which also enable the acceptance of payments via a smartphone or tablet – it is much more convenient and cost-effective for small businesses and sole traders to accept electronic payments.
Rethinking payments
Some of the developments currently under way were unimaginable only five years ago, says Mr Sloan. Mobile devices are not just changing how consumers pay, but also how retailers accept payments. The innovation goes beyond developing solutions for new merchant categories, such as sole traders. Larger, more established retailers are also rethinking the shopping experience for their customers.
“Merchants are replacing the cash register with iPads or Android tablets,” says Mr Sloan. And with tablets instead of fixed tills, customers will no longer have to queue to pay. Instead, store assistants can roam around the store with the ability to accept payments with a mobile device, such as a tablet or smartphone. “It makes it easier for consumers to consume and merchants to sell things,” says Mr Sloan.
There are many forms of innovations being introduced by retailers and many experts believe there is no winner-takes-all solution. Instead, a new ecosystem of payments innovations is evolving. An array of mobile, tablet and card solutions is emerging in developed markets. Mr Sloan explains that Global Payments is agnostic about which mobile technology will gain the most traction, whether it is tap-and-go near-field communication payments, QR codes – which can be scanned with a smartphone – or PayPal’s latest in-store solution. “We have to enable all of those. It is an unhappy experience for consumers if a merchant cannot accept them,” says Mr Sloan.
Point-of-sale technology
Part of Mr Sloan’s strategy is to continue developing products and services for merchants to offer at the point of sale. Dynamic currency conversion is one such example, which allows consumers to see how much they are spending in their home currency when they are paying by card in another country. And in Asia, the company has introduced instalment plans at the point of sale, which enable retailers to offer customers the option of paying for the goods over a certain number of months and is a service the merchant would finance.
Aside from investing in innovations, the company has been building its processing platforms. Global Payments has recently invested $40m to expand its capacity from a peak of 500 transactions per second to 2000 concurrent transactions per second around the world. “We now have the capacity to support 10 years of growth,” says Mr Sloan. And the average turnaround time between a card being swiped and the authorisation coming back has been reduced by 20% to 30%, he says.
It is not just the capacity and speed that is a focus for the company, but also security. When asked which is more important, Mr Sloan says: “It is like baking a cake – you need all the ingredients.”

This is embarrassing, I admit. 
I do want to repeat that I never recommended Neo &amp; Bee as an investment. The company seemed overvalued, which is why I didn't do due diligence. I was excited about the prospect of seeing a group of people taking Bitcoin to a mainstream audience (that's what I meant with "the future of finance"), and Neo's marketing campaign seemed very effective: during their launch, the whole island was talking about them.

"A prominent use of TLS is for securing World Wide Web traffic between a website and a web browser encoded with the HTTP protocol. This use of TLS to secure HTTP traffic constitutes the HTTPS protocol." (HTTPS is now used on 36% of websites worldwide.)
"Released in 1996, SSL version 3.0 represented a complete redesign of the protocol produced by Paul Kocher working with Netscape engineers Phil Karlton and Alan Freier, with a reference implementation by Christopher Allen and Tim Dierks of Consensus Development."

@_date: 2012-06-15 19:06:57
I forgot about the transaction fees. 
According to dollardaze, the global money supply as of december 2010 was about $50 trillion (=cash + sight and demand deposits denominated in USD + all foreign currencies). 
Let's now speculate that by 2030, bitcoin manages to gain a 10% global currency market share. That would give the 21 million bitcoin together a rough total market cap of 5 trillion—or, put otherwise, every single bitcoin would have an approximate value of $238095 (measured in 2010 USdollars).  
Is there any way of calculating what an average mining operation would make in transaction fees (perhaps by extrapolating what they are getting now with a bitcoin market cap of $50 million, what they would bet with a bitcoin market cap of 5000 billion)? 
EDIT: 
I think I found the additional info on blockchain.info. It says that today, with a total bitcoin market cap of $55 million, there are 59103 transactions yielding a total of 37.23 BTC in transaction fees. 
Assuming that the transaction volume will grow at the same pace as the market cap, we can estimate that when bitcoin reaches a market cap of $5000 billion, which is 90909 times larger than it is today, the daily transaction volume will have increased to [59103*90909=] 5373 million. The transaction fees will then also have grown by the same pace I assume, from 37.23 BTC today, to [37.23*90909=] 3 384 452.07BTC. 
Calculating the future value of these 3 384 452.07BTC, we would have to multiply them as well with the number 90909, which leads us to the conclusion that in a world in which 10% of the currency markets are dominated by bitoin, the total transaction fees earned by the miners who are recording 5373 million daily transactions, would amount to $805 842 544 156 in 2010 dollars. In other words, the bitcoin mining industry would then have grown to an $805 billion industry—about 1,3% of global GDP.  
... in other words, if the success of bitcoin increases, it seems that there will be no lack of incentive for miners to keep mining even though eventually they are only rewarded in terms of transaction fees.

My comment was meant in part as a jest. Indeed I read quite a few Hayek chapters, yes. And I read more from Mises (his teacher). Found Hayek's writings quite convoluted and I experienced him as less principled than others in the Austrian tradition.

The size of the Bitcoin mining 'pond' is clearly defined by on the one hand the amount of BTC distributed among the miners + the transaction fees obtained, and on the other hand by the market price of Bitcoin and the expectations of BTC mining investors. 
So yes, unless the BTC price spikes up sharply in the short run, I think we are in a race which will not be survived by all mining companies. It's not for the faint of heart.   
The main factor for the lasting success of an ASIC mining company, I believe, will be the quality of the people involved. I know this may sound overly superficial, but the design and production process of these machines is so very elaborate that specialized knowledge, choice of the right partners, and careful management of the process makes all the difference.

In several Asian markets today, there is a premium on physical gold for future delivery in comparison to western market. This means the market currently places more trust in the capacity of the Asian markets to deliver the physical gold at the time the contract expires, than it does in the western markets (there are many indications about how western bullion banks may not have enough physical gold to cover their paper promises).
Presales of Bitcoin mining rigs are in effect also futures contracts. Some will carry premiums, some will carry discounts. Time will tell whether either of these are justified.

Hi Jumparound, 
In answer to your criticisms: 
1. I mainly wanted to point out the blind eye many people have towards the current financial system when criticizing Bitcoin as a tool to potentially fund terrorists. Sure, there are many scenarios thinkable in which Bitcoin can be used for nefarious purposes, but that is also the case within the current fiat money paradigm. 
2. Contrary to popular belief, once the quantities are large enough, it is fairly easy to move fiat money anonymously throughout the financial system today. Google 'shadow banking'. 
3. Contrast this to Bitcoin, where the ledger is 100% public, and once society at large tracks potentially dangerous movements of money, anyone can come in and join the investigation. 
4. My reference to fractional reserve banking was made to point out that when people handle money that's not theirs and even not that of their clients (conjured up by credit expansion), they tend to be less critical about what actually happens with that money. 
5. Note that I said Bitcoin has the potential to end _inflation_ funded wars and terrorism. Fiat money by nature can be legally counterfeited, and has been used extensively to sponsor large scale military operations such as the war in Vietnam (hence the inflation of the seventies), WWII (hence the weak pound sterling and the destroyed German mark after 1945), and the war in Iraq (hence the weakening status of the US dollar as the global reserve currency. 
6. Wars funded by inflation have always taken on much larger proportions than wars funded by direct taxation. Simply because there is a limit to how much one can raise taxes on a family that is already sending its main cost winner as cannon fodder into the trenches. There is however no limit to how much fiat money a government can print in times of war, because the effects of money printing only come later, and offer the opportunity to place the blame for the higher prices on the food producers, supermarkets, and other operators of capital goods in the economy.

Excellent article. Bitcoin is very much the red pill of the financial system. 
If Bitcoin becomes the new gold, price should rise indeed to extraordinary levels. The number I calculated was $340.000. In my presentation at the Bitcoin conference I gave some more price projections. 
This is the estimated value of one bitcoin if: 
- Hedge funds allocate 1% to BTC: $1230
- Argentines change cash dollar for BTC: $2480
- Gold owners sell 1% for BTC: $3500
- BTC takes over e-commerce: $10.000
- 25% of shadow economy uses BTC $43.000

Good point people do say this. I think the consumer adoption is not slow, but I can see how it seems that way. Here's a graph that I'll show to illustrate that:  
@_date: 2013-08-25 00:47:33


In general, if there is significant risk that a successful company would have to sell its goods at a lower than market value to the state (governments often want this), then there is a powerful incentive to internationalize in order to make sure that enough product can be sold to other parties around the globe.    
Speaking for myself, even though I see no philosophical justification for the existence of states, I am relatively pragmatic about a scenario in which governments decide to buy into cryptocurrencies, either by using money or using the threat of violence (likely both). 
Look at what Russia and China are doing with gold: governments there are buying gold directly from gold mines in order to shore up the uncertain fiat reserves of their central banks. 
Should the CEO's of those companies stand up, refuse, and say "this is where I draw the line"? Consequence would imo only be that either the company is boycotted and bullied until it gave in, or that the CEO is replaced.  
I don't see much of a problem with governments buying gold. They are following the market by doing this, confirming the decision of prudent investors around the world, that fiat money is not very trustworthy and that it is worthwhile to consider alternative, hard moneys, and increasing the value of these hard moneys in the process.   
Actually I have little doubt that one day, maybe in the near future even, governments will start buying into bitcoins and Bitcoin mining capacity. I think rather than to fight this evolution by standing in the line of fire, I think it's much more fruitful to get out of the way and quietly support the efforts of entrepreneurs involved in workarounds to keep insuring that the world has a access to pseudonymous, decentralized, p2p money. 
Related: Nicholas Plassaras wrote an interesting study about how it is quite conceivable that the IMF will start buying bitcoins or even force its member states to by bitcoins in order to protect against what it calls a "currency attack":

CoinTerra will announce other products in the future. Also, chip sales find their way back to smaller scale investors in the form of IPO's and cloud hashing services. 
I hope I don't sound offensive saying this, but how does a first offer of a high end product at a price not everyone agrees with show a lack of decency and professionalism? In a market with multiple players, isn't by definition every price one that not everyone agrees with?

The Bank for International Settlements said the same thing, also in 1996: 
“Since  banknotes  in  circulation  represent  non-interest-bearing  central  banks  liabilities, a  substitution  of  e-money  for  cash  would  lead  to  a  corresponding decline in central bank asset holdings, and the interest  earned  on  these  assets  that  constitutes  central  bank  seigniorage  revenue. … even a moderate loss of seigniorage could be of concern to some  governments, particularly in countries with large budget deficits.”

Difference with Bitcoin and gold is that it's very simple to check whether your bitcoins are still there or not, one can just check the public key. As soon as the bitcoins move, you've been robbed and you can sue / ask damages to your fund or bank.
With gold, one can be stolen from and only find out many years later, long after the bank management has been changed and the profits have been taken.

1. If governments around the world would start waging an all out quasi unanimous war on Bitcoin, this would possibly intimidate many investors and cause a big crash in the price. As Bitcoin exchanges start developing on the black market, prices would then recover over time. 
2. Some vulnerability is discovered in the protocol and is immediately exploited before a fix is found. Result is a panic and a large drop in price until the bug is fixed. 
3. A new protocol is developed that in a number of respects is superior to Bitcoin. Result is a gradual adoption of the new protocol, to the detriment of Bitcoin. One analogy is perhaps myspace =&gt; facebook. 
I believe these are the most important ones. As many people have remarked before, Bitcoin's future is likely a binary one: 10 years from now either it will be worth zero, or it will be worth many multiples of today's prices.

I can't share yet what chip prices will be, but in general: the way markets work is that if there are areas with high profit margins, this attracts entrepreneurs who meet the need for more production capacity in that area. The side effect of this is that general profitability tends to drop, because of competition. Then there are yet other entrepreneurs who come in and start working on increasing efficiency, for example by scaling up.
The make the analogy: the reason why panning for gold in the rivers became less profitable is not because the equipment companies sold their gear at the wrong price, it was because competition put pressure on profit margins. In response, the market became more professional and shifted from individuals panning for gold, to larger and more efficient gold mining companies.
All this being said, it's too early to say if the era of the individual Bitcoin miner is over. Yes, competition is increasing, but we will need to see who can and who cannot deliver on their promises.  


CoinTerra does not offer cloud mining / cloud hashing for the moment. Again in general: entrepreneurs who are in it for the long term have an incentive to create profitable services for their clients. This is what I mean with my hopes that this market will mature. Yet I feel we have to give ASIC companies some slack as well: developments are happening at breakneck speed, and it is very difficult to predict how the market will develop, even in the short run.  


CoinTerra wants to give out factual information as soon as it is available. As long as there is optimization possible in the design and production process, technical details are still prone to change.

CoinTerra is receiving a lot of interest from smaller buyers, and will cater to this with specialized products. I understand the frustration that these products are not available as of yet. The logic behind this is that there is a limit to how much complexity one can handle as a startup. Smaller products require as many production steps as larger products, yet they have the same logistical requirements for example. 
At the same time we are seeing that the market is already working on solving this problem: the company is getting requests of people who wish to become resellers (in other words: retail sellers) of chips, people who want to buy chips to make CoinTerra clones, companies who want to offer cloudhashing services, etc. All of this will help bridge the gap between us and the retail market faster and more smoothly than if the CT team would try to immediately do everything by itself.

Fractional reserve banking is a system that really started to become legal and commonplace at the dawn of central banking (central banks being the lender of last resort, always ready to bail out a bank if needed). 
Storage of Bitcoin - versus storage of gold - can happen at virtually no cost and cannot be controlled by governments. Monopolization of the bitcoin-"bank"-system is therefore impossible. 
Sure there will be tricksters who offer amazing returns on 'savings', fooling people into 'depositing' their money - and these initiatives will fail and the fraud will become apparent. Also will there be honest businessmen who offer clients the possibility to loan their money to third parties, whereby they can only claim it back after a fixed period of time, with interest. 
Difference between deposit and loan is that the former is understood to be immediately available, and the latter is unavailable for a fixed period of time.

Here is the source for the Orlin Grabbe quote: 
@_date: 2013-08-25 10:11:18
It is a fact of nature that producing chips with transistors that are 28nm wide (human hair is 100,000 nm) in order to serve as nodes in a network of a 5 year old discruptive digital currency involves risks. In the current environment, Bitcoin ASIC chip producers don't have the capacity to absorb all the risks involved. 
The irony is that if they would have this capacity, there wouldn't be any risk left, and with that all profit opportunities would have disappeared as well. 
So what is the investor to do? 
I would argue that the best strategy is to adopt what all wise investors in traditional markets do: diversify. 
If you cannot afford multiple mining rigs in the current environment, I think it is better to buy a stock or cloud hashing contract in a diversified mining operation.
There are still +1M bitcoins distributed among miners every year. This is a phenomenon that will never return in the history of Bitcoin. So I do think there are still very significant profit opportunities in the sector.

I would second that. Conferences are the perfect place for entrepreneurs and programmers to meet and it is where new ideas and companies are born. 
For example, quite a number of people I met at the conference in early 2012 in London (when Bitcoin was worth $10) have now become very successful entrepreneurs. Many of the relationships were forged at the conference.
I can't speak for them, but I'm confident that elbitcon would be happy to promote such an event.

He who criticizes Bitcoin for making terrorism easier should compare it to our current system. 
The Norwegian bomber and mass murderer Anders Breivik financed his entire operation with a simple bank loan under the pretense of starting a farm. 
If it were the bankers' own money, perhaps he would have done a more thorough background check. 
Under Bitcoin there is no use for fractional reserve banking, and hence no opportunity for banks to engage in credit expansion (handing out free money that is not theirs in the first place). 
Seriously, who in the Bitcoin community would have given the young an unemployed Breivik (with zero background in farming) a six figure loan from his own money?
Once Bitcoin is more widely adopted, it will allow for some crimes that were more difficult to perform before, sure. But more importantly, it has the potential to restrict and eventually end inflation funded wars and acts of terrorism. 
Don't forget that in the 20th century alone, governments killed over 250 million citizens:

In principle I don't see a problem with companies who wish to buy large quantities of chips. Usually they are engaged in cloud hashing, or they do an ipo allowing the public to buy shares and receive dividends of the mining activity. 
I think we will see the concentration of Bitcoin mining centers increase no matter what, that's an evolution to be expected when an industry matures and division of labor increases. 
It's most likely that the highest performing of these centers will be installed in countries where governments are more respectful of private property and less likely to pull the plug or confiscate the rigs. 
This is what you also saw happen in gold. 
However, large concentrations of physical gold are of course much more risky for the users of gold as a safe haven than larger concentrations of mining capacity - because the bitcoins themselves remain by definition ditributed 'in the cloud'. Even a successful 51% attack cannot destroy Bitcoin btw, it is rather a major inconvenience.  
If you have counter arguments I'm happy to hear them, my thinking evolves constantly. 
- update - 
All of this being said (economies of scale, etc), there is also a significant amount of 'rest electricity' in the world, places where electricity is cheap or even freely available. That's one reason why I don't think small scale mining equipment will go away, on the contrary. For the moment CoinTerra does not have the provide capacity to provide very small scale rigs to the retail market, but that can change in the future.   
@_date: 2013-08-25 00:24:43
Yes I'm happy to. Gold mining is in essence a pretty straightforward business. You break rocks and pull the yellow metal out. And if the cost of doing that is lower than what the market pays you for the yellow metal, you make a profit. Other than being the most saleable (liquid) gold on the market, the activity of gold mines does not interfere that much with the stock of existing aboveground gold: even in the bonanza years of 1860 and 1935, gold mines only added some 2.5% to the existing supply. 
Bitcoin mining is similar to gold mining in that the existing 'underground' supply of mineable bitcoins is limited, and that eventually it will be a game of finding the most energy-efficient ways of prying the bitcoin-bounties loose from the network. I see other similarities when I think about the now upcoming large scale bitcoin mining in datacentres: the political aspect will come into play much more in the next years. Stocks in Bitcoin mining centres will therefore I think not only be valued according to their immediate profitability, but also according to the perceived political stability of the country in which the mining takes place.     
Another similarity is that rises in the price of bitcoin and gold lead to increased capacity in the mining sector and thus to larger profits there. Few people know this, but the largest profits in gold mining were not made *during* the 1972-1980 bull market in the gold price, but actually in the period right after it: during the bull market the capacity was ramped up, and the fruits were plucked in the period right after. We are seeing something similar today, with a ramp up in Bitcoin mining capacity investments during and after the april-may rally and as a result an increased capacity with higher revenues (the revenues are higher because the adjustment of the network difficulty doesn't happen fast enough to keep the profits at a low and constant rate of 25 BTC/10minutes, we are more at something closer to 50 BTC/10 minutes now).   
There are also major differences of course. In gold mining there is not something like a 51% attack! (Although nationalizations are a well known risk, these tend to happen when governments are in desperate straits.) Also in gold mining, successful producers don't directly decrease the profits of their competitors - as is the case in Bitcoin mining. Also gold mining by definition is a lot less mobile than Bitcoin mining, which can be done basically anywhere there is electricity available - which makes the sphere much more competitive. 
It's clear that these fundamental differences between gold and bitcoin mining mean that both industries will develop in different directions. I think it's fascinating to think about how cryptocurrency mining will look like in 5 or 10 years from now.

I first learned about anonymous e-cash and assassination markets from David Friedman when I heard him talk at the 2008 Libertarian Alliance conference. 
In that talk he outlined how one of the implications of public key encryption was that criminal firms could now build brand name reputations for their cyberspace identities (such as indeed we've seen with The Silk Road), and then went on to describe a business plan for a criminal hitman organisation called 'Murder Inc'.    
Here is the video: 
34:45 public key encryption
37:00 implication: criminal firms can build brand name reputation
37:45 fee for a hitman is lower than cost of a new car
38:30 business plan for 'Murder Inc.' 
39:30 describes how the company would provide proof it is for real by posting publicly an encrypted prediction few days before a high profile murder, after which the company would then provide the decryption key which proves it is the author of both the prediction and the murder.

2) Vulnerabilities:  is probably a better source with better estimates then what I could provide.
3) Superior features: I tend to think that Bitcoin as a protocol has so many beneficial network effects, that we would need another paradigm shift to 'jump over' it. Analogy is the protocol for email, which, despite the fact that many people are not satisfied with it, is still in use after many years. 
Difficulty of consensus: over time the Bitcoin mining sector will get more and more of its profits directly from transaction fees, and so I think that if for some reason the continued general acceptance is in danger should a certain change to the protocol not be implemented, that the interests of the miners will be aligned to make a consensus decision.
