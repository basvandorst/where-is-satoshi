no worries mate :) Please update us on your final draft and your CEOs reaction!

Dude, i admire your effort, but this is totally the wrong way to approach things... your CEO likely doesnt give a shit how the blockchain works, all he wants to know is the answer to the following question: How does this benefit my company? What you wrote here doesnt address that at all..

But, but.... there are only 196 countries :(

Perhaps all or none of those things are true. Making these kinds of assertions with such a high level of confidence is honestly just really fallacious.

Honestly, there is no proof that he stole them... the kind of attitude many people have about him is how things like witch hunts got started. Maybe he did it, but maybe he didn't. That is not enough to threaten somebody with death.

Him? Or the whole of mtgox?
edit: and should he really be receiving death threats because of this?

Part of me believes thats a lie. You would have to take so many drugs. I think he said that so that there would be no 'drug money' for them to find and therefore take away from him. He has them tucked away in a bitcoin wallet probably.

Despite the fact that you either confusingly or intentionally missed the point of this post, both of those are just shit tourist traps. There are much much better places for both of those things.

depends what you take and where you are I guess..

But the best engines are already ranked in strength due to long computer tournaments. Right now Komodo is champion, but Stockfish and Komodo are trading the title often.

Perhaps even illegal in some way?

Greetings from Bremen! To answer your question: because im dirt poor.. Good luck with the project though!

By that logic you (assuming you are a good guy to begin with) will be a bad person eventually as well.
