It's too strong to say HW wallets prevent hacking or phishing. 
Hw wallets can help to prevent, but they're not a silver bullet solution.
HW wallets can be used to verify outputs before signing a transaction with a [hopefully] practically offline key, but it doesn't prevent people being tricked into using an attacker's address in the first place.

But these bugs were fixed in bitcoin's infancy.  
The bitcoin protocol is akin to the world's biggest ever open bug-bounty program and if there was anything left to exploit, someone would have done so by now.

One could argue that BTC "started" when it  posted its first recorded trade.
Legend has it this was 2 pizzas (approx $40 of value) for 10kBTC, equating to a first trade price of  $0.004/BTC.
It's fair to say the price right now @ $8400 is 2.1 million times higher than the price 10 years ago @ $0.004.

It's true that retail banks generally have ripoff FX rates.
But there are options and this is one of the routes I've used that has been frictionless:
deposit BTC to gdax
  sell BTC/EUR @ spot rate
withdraw EUR from GDAX to Revolut
  sell EUR to GBP @ spot rate on Revolut
withdraw GBP from Revolut to business bank
% is negligible.
If you can find sufficient liquidity in GBPUSD on GDAX you can withdraw directly to a retail account.

Get a coinbase pro account and get verified, then you can trade and transfer instantly. Although BTCGBP pair doesn't have much liquidity last I looked.  Coinbase's retail side are too big/busy for their own good imo...
Failing coinbase pro, try bitstamp and kraken, I've only ever had positive experiences with all of these.

There are many options:
auction the coins like US marshals do
there are lots of over-the-counter (OTC) places you can agree large trades.
have a broker sell them for you over a period of time with an agreed strategy.
sell them yourself at places like the daily gemini auctions.
imo, it's all irrelevant, because the question is, should you sell?
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:08:50
Whilst i suspect there are exchanges operating this way, I honestly don't believe BitMEX does. All BitMEX customers get dedicated offline multi-sig wallets and can see your address's balance on the blockchain, just like any other.

do u even rpc bro
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:39:36
assuming default coinbase pro fee tier and taker orders:
buy 1 btc @ $10000 
fee is $25
total dollars paid to buy 1 btc = $10k + $25 = $10,025
(nb fee is added to total)
sell 1 btc @ $10,000
fee is $25
total dollars received by selling 1 btc = $10,000 - $25 = $9,975
(nb fee is subtracted from total)
the example in your pic exaggerates the fee rounding effect and is technically a display bug.

The best solution I've found for this is on bitmex.com. The leveraged products allow you to keep a subset of your holdings on the exchange, significantly reducing counterparty risk.
Ensure you understand that other risks exist, like socialized losses and funding rates.  
Your appetite for risk and the amount of leverage you use will determine how much position-babysitting is required.

People do finds ways to break through. Shared-tenancy opens you up to whole new classes of vulnerabilities (not only in the virtualization layer, but things like spectre/meltdown too.)  This is why major websites use instances with dedicated tenancy for anything even slightly sensitive.  Major websites most definitely do not share hosts with other customers!
I agree that administering servers is hard, but I'm not aware of any security benefits a cloud-hosted server has over a self-hosted server.

interesting.

Can confirm, was November 2015, either a large trader's fat finger or a buggy-bot, that bought all offers up to $2200  (fair value was ~$350)
Gemini reversed the trades, but some charts still show the scar  eg: 
Even legacy financial exchanges have blips like this, although typically limit-up/limit-down prices are calculated at the beginning of each trading session, which if reached, cause the market to suspend and give participants a short window to manage their orders (and get their sh!t together!) before instrument re-open and trading resumes.
okcoin.com applied a similar mechanism to their quarterly futures recently (they didn't actually suspend trading, but they did apply an upper ceiling to bid prices, and it lasted many hours, if not days.)  IMO this is far more questionable behavior than Gemini's rollback.
