I never stated that, I said that was the cause of the crash.  I didn't even state that it was fixed, but that it is mostly fixed, because we are still *mostly* dependent on exchanges for acquiring bitcoin.
Almost everyone I see here being poo poo about this is nearly always from /all and have 0 coins.  People really that sour?
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:36:36
Everyone brings up the 2013 crash while failing to mention *why* it crashed, which was the single largest exchange being untrustworthy which has been mostly solved by my more competition.

"oh you mean the cars you have to drive on horse roads?  I bet the millions of horses are shaking in their boots durr."
Watch those trillions of freely printed fiat dollars hyperinflate in the face of a deflationary, decentralized and transparent currency with no primary issuing authority with no special interests.
Much like the legacy media has been entirely btfo, so will old finance.

I always look back at those transactions and think "ohp, yeah there's me getting high for $8,000, oh and another time I got high for $7,500".  And those were just a couple hundred dollars in 2016.

If you really want to see how skewed and fucked up public opinion of Bitcoin is, go look in the comments section of any popular public fb post that mentions it.  It's hilarious.

You underestimate how much blood and how gnarly it was.  We had a funeral pyre with all of my old moles though, it was beautiful and gross, major healing experience for me, we were all pretty wasted at that point.

You don't have to buy a whole coin. Most people who will be using bitcoin will probably never own a whole coin.  It's super easy to get into through either coinbase.com or gemini.  This is still just the beginning.

That's more representative of all the shitcoins and ICO's popping up.  All of those dotcoms literally did nothing of value, and were just iterations and imitations (shitcoins) the internet itself (Bitcoin in this metaphor) never "crashed".

people still haven't realized that little bit about the price discovery process.  1 BTC is arbitrary, it could be potentially a huge denomination.

I made a "bread-crumb" story for mine, each word leads to the next through free-association.  
say you got "apple snake river tree"  you'd memorize it as: the apple in the snakes mouth at the river under the tree.  Super easy to memorize and you can even keep relevant art around as subliminal reinforcement.

I can't believe you guys haven't figured out that Satoshi is a time traveler.  We were headed down the darkest timeline in parallel human history and he came back to the perfect time to free us.

BTC hasn't changed in value.  BTC's existence has just shown how little fiat is worth in comparison.
All fiat currencies are going to be met with their "true" inflationary value in the face of crypto, 30's Deutschmark style. 
Fiat will not be worth the paper it's printed on when people realize what's possible with a trustworthy decentralized deflationary currency.
