No because I’m not involved in the decision making so even if I answer your questions with my opinions it’s a meaningless waste of time.
My only point to you is that if every business, every government, every person waited until they had a 100% solution before taking any action then the world would be a much different and I believe worse place. Because there will never be a perfect solution to any problem that is perfectly fair to every human on the planet. Waiting for one before doing anything is ridiculous.

“Rushing” lol. As if the concept of reparations and thoughts on how to do it are new in 2019.

You are right. Doing nothing at all rather than doing something that might not be 100% accurate and unassailably fair and equitable is the way to go.
I mean, don’t try anything unless it is 100% right?
This kind of thinking would have let the USSR make it to the moon first.

I'd like to see normal people in survival movies. Happen to know of any good ones I can check out?

Is there even an estimate of how many people ODed from good they received from Ross's site? I'm not saying it's his fault they ODed because ultimately they made their own choice about what they put in their body. I'm just wondering if there is a number out there. Or the number of how many minors were able to purchase illegal goods from his site?
IMO the punishment doesn't really fit the crime but really what do you expect from the government?

Did Silk Road have a way to strictly prohibit illegal drug sales to minors? IMO that would fall under the umbrella of child endangerment.
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:38:37
Sounds reasonable but that's really just an opinion, not a factual statement.
Even so how about minors being able to purchase illegal drugs from Silk Road? That was a thing, wasn't it?
@_date: 2017-05-28 02:29:46
Can't even make a purchase because purchasing is suspended due to high volume, so nothing to go through.
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:59:35
Too bad we'll never know if your opinion, while it sounds reasonable, is actually factual.

Well I am buying bitcoins. However I also like to gamble and if it is easier/safer/more fun or whatever to gamble with bitcoin then I might like to do that too.
@_date: 2017-05-24 07:43:16
Yep I agree you have no hard data to show.
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:28:05
I hope you are right. Too bad there aren't any peer reviewed statistical studies to find out how true those opinions are. I'm not being an ass, I really wish there were peer reviewed statistical studies on the topic.

Awesome, thanks! I haven't read all of this yet but I'm so glad I saw it. I was thinking of joining a site that takes a bitcoin deposit and then converts it to currency. At least that it what I think they meant when they replied to my question about it.

The point as I see it is that in person a dealer could see that they are dealing to a minor and then decide if they want to continue the deal. I don't believe that is the case with Silk Road where it would seemingly be much easier for a minor to pretend they aren't a minor when completing the transaction than in a face to face transaction.

You disagree that the State of Texas should get the same kind of punishment for doing the same kind of thing that Silk Road did? I'm not following you.
@_date: 2017-05-15 01:36:23
Is it a better strategy to deposit fiat and then if you are lucky enough to win to request payment in bitcoin? Or does it not matter much?
Like if I get payment in bitcoin and the value of bitcoin continues to climb I've effectively gained more on my winnings, right?
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:56:05
IMO it should be just as illegal for any state to allow those kind of gun sales. I wouldn't want to see it happen anywhere, Texas or Silk Road.
