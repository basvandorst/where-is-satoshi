Ignore taxes? Also buying a house with bitcoins?

If it makes it easier, im Norwegian - i heard some bad things about coinbase.  
  
Lets say i make it, kraken have no questions or holdings or any BS when you want to cash out 100K USD?  
  
Also, when should i transfer my money to the Trezor i bought? Value 10K+ USD 50K 100K 200K ?

If i transfer a larger sum of coins, will it cost more?  
Can i pay more/less to make it go faster/slower?

Okay last question, can you ELI5 in short what Chainlink actually does by "solving the oracle problem" i have seen some videos about smartcontracts etc but I'm having a hard time getting it.

1. Having money on an exchange does NOT count as a wallet right?  
2. Is it possible to fuck up a transfer, lets say i send Harmony to my bitcoin/ETH address -so i lose all harmony?  
3. I have an seed for my trezor to store my crypto, these specific 12/18/24 words hold every different crypto inside my trezor, correct?    
  


I want to me rich, call me delusional or something, but i feel like it's hard earning a lot by just holding btc. Lets say its hit 10x before i sell (which is kinda a miracle, because that might take years if it will eventually happen).  
Investing 5K in an alt is indeed risky, but 5K will not ruin my life it it fails, i will never sell under what i paid. Chainlink just popped of lately, it even might go up even more the coming months.

Would also like to know, is binance good?
@_date: 2019-07-14 20:09:57
Heard of both, but more familiar with Kraken. Also answer the question if you can please.

Why would i want another fiat than my countries?  
  
Do you store your cryptos on the Gemini exchange?

is exchange considered a wallet? Will i need to pay 2 fee's if i do the following:  
1. Move 100 chainlink from Binance to Trezor.  
2. Move 100 chainlink from Trezor to Binance

So when i become a cryptomillionaire, they cant help me convert it into USD or other fiat?  
  
Will i need to send for example 1000 bitcoins to another exchange, then cash out? cc = credit card?

I just got Trezor, and im a little confused. Still got my coins on the exchange.  
  
On my Trezor there is lik 10 wallets btc, etc, litecoin etc...  
  
But where are the other 990+ coins it supports?  
  
If i want to store my chainlink on it - how do i send it from the exchange to the trezor?
@_date: 2019-07-14 20:13:22
Okay, i actually bought an Trezor. But i wan't to be done with my trading before i HODL. I'm planning on buying like 5K USD of Harmony. How can i store it if its not supported by Trezor?

Thanks, last question - which coins do you think will be a good 1-2 year investment? Other than BTC ofc.  
  
I'm looking into LINK, ONE, FTM, XMR
@_date: 2019-07-13 15:53:08
I kind of understand this. That tokens are under the big coins.  
  
What is the step-by-step to move my chainlink from binance to trezor wallet? Send them to my ether address?  Also transferring from exchange to wallet will always decrease the amount because of fee's right?
