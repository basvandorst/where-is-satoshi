Yes, I get the joke. Again, you're both obviously very smart. I think that you are sometimes too immediately dismissive of or hostile to new ideas -- see: the James D'Angelo and Jeff Garzik interviews. You can appear to be more interested in winning the argument than being right.

I should mention that I'm a big fan of the show :) You bring new and interesting perspective to bitcoin and do a good job telling us when the emperor has no clothes. You're easily batting 600.

Chris and Josh are both obviously smart (especially Chris) and obviously not well read in the subjects addressed in this discussion, which include elements of ethics, political philosophy, economics, and even risk management -- though to be fair, the same could be said of Adam. In light of that, some humility might be in order.
You can also tell who didn't get sufficiently roasted for bad jokes in high school and forced to produce better material.

I think you got distracted and forgot to dig deeper into how and why he uses bitcoin. Still, I learned... a lot.

BU is my favourite podcast and I wish I had friends like Chris and Junseth -- smart, contrarian thinkers you can bounce ideas off of and debate everything from EMH to the morality of prostitution. But they have gotten too confident in many of their views for lack of proper pushback. They deserve a better class of opposition.
I'd like to see them debate the likes of David Friedman, Bryan Caplan, etc., not, with all due respect, dilettantes like Kokesh or this guy.

I know u/brighton36 is skeptical of IPFS but wonder if he's updated his take on OB given imminent Tor integration. Care to share?
