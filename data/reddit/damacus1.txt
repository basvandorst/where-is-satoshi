It also has the consequences of showing that Bitcoin is SERIOUS and RESILIENT. Look at Bill Miller from Legg Mason getting involved only after seeing what many thought would **kill** BTC impact it but still leave it significantly above its price level from a year earlier. It's also when I got in and started taking BTC seriously. Gox has been priced in. The exchange situation you're talking about is, IMHO, all priced in and has been so bad, that I think it is more likely to improve over time. I'm still a buyer.

Thanks for your input on the Bitcoin subreddits, This does help clear up some confusion I had about Q-12 and Q-13 in the notice they put out. I think they would've been more clear had they mentioned that Q-12 was also regarding 1099s when they talk about 'information reporting.' I had also wondered if they were talking about reporting capital gains there.
Unrelated tax question, how do you feel about when you send money to a tipping service?  Say I send 0.2 BTC to a tip bot - can I recognize the CGT there, or would I need to recognize CGT each time I sent a tip from that balance?
*Edit: Thanks for the responses. Gift tax makes sense there. It seems like [the recipient wouldn't have to pay taxes on that]( either (on the income) but I'm guessing unless they gifted that away, they'd have to record the price / date if they sold it later and recognized a gain.

Thankfully it's not the same as gold. Gold (like other PMs) is taxed as a collectible, and there is no long-term gains tax rate.  At least treating it like regular stock provides that benefit.

They could see transactions to / from Coinbase, for example, or they could decide to audit a vendor that accepts BTC and look at what customers have paid with BTC. Trifling with the IRS is unwise.

Ah, I didn't see that article. I searched 'Chase' before I posted and looked in the first 2 or 3 pages and saw nothing so I posted. 
I think it's useful to have the bank's name in the title so people can find it more easily. Also, the CNBC article links to images of the cancellation letter which I found interesting.

Paper Wallet / Security / Permanence of Address question.
Why do most people move on to using a new wallet address once they've sent bitcoins out of it?  I do understand that once money is sent from an address, the previously undisclosed public key is now visible, but isn't that address still secure so long as the private key is secure?  Just curious, because I was thinking about donation QR codes on printed materials - and how you'd want to regularly move money out of that to a cold storage address, but would still want to be able to receive new coins coming in to that address over time.
TL;DR - can I keep using the same address to receive money and drain it to my cold storage, or do I really need to use fresh addresses?

"As for the long transaction delay and poor scalability, I long considered bit gold as a design for "high-powered money" that like gold could be used as an investment vehicle, a medium for large transactions, and a reserve currency against which digital notes could be issued. It would be however be far more securely auditable than remote gold vaults. If you're right on this critique Bitcoin may be destined to become a high-powered money rather than a day-to-day payment system for the masses.
And what's up with the term "cryptocurrency"? What is it supposed to mean? Cryptography is used to protect payments systems as radically different as credit cards, Chaumian digital cash, and Bitcoin. The term encourages the popular but profoundly naive view of Bitcoin as merely another form of digital cash."

replied to me above this. It is in line with what I'd expect to be reasonable.
"It means if you mine $100 in BTC you have to report $100 in income at the end of the year. Of course you can deduct expenses as you would for any other source of income, such as electricity and equipment (at whatever level of depreciation is reasonable)."
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:52:20
What about mining? Says they're recognized as income. That's the part that threw me. Do you know what's up with that?
It really bothers me that just mining coins could bump you up into a higher tax bracket even if all you're doing is mining and not selling. It feels like a "bug" in the tax code since everything else about cap gains how I understand it is specifically just looking at valuation when you sell.
*edit: edited to add my reason for feeling cognitive dissonance.

That's a good point. You're correct of course that mining coins costs money, and this would be analogous to precious metal miners and how they figure their cost basis mining PMs from the earth, or running recycling / recovery plants.

Poor shibes will be filing some massively complicated Schedule D's as much as they're given to tipping. :-(
The IRS really needs provisions for microtransactions and exempted volume / flow or something. Things like this can really stifle innovation.

The supply is growing, but the total growth is capped, and the growth rate of the BTC supply is much slower than the increase in buying power BTC has seen. It's deflationary, and that's one of the (serious) problems with BTC as a currency.. but it's awesome for capital appreciation.
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:43:30
Some people had invested too much, but I think others were too trusting. I suspect a good number of those who were gox'd still want to be in BTC.. but they'll be a lot more likely to move their BTC to paper wallets or some other form they directly control.

New guy here. Like Mr. Miller, I also bought my first Bitcoin only after Mt.Gox collapsed. Long-time skeptic, but when the currency survived that bombshell, I decided that it was robust enough to start accumulating, regardless of its volatility.  (Bought 0.25 BTC on that big green candle earlier this month after my accounts were verified, an additional 0.27 BTC a few days ago at 623 spot, and today I bought 0.48 BTC at 585.)
So, in a way, Mt. Gox's collapse may ultimately have benefited Bitcoin.

I'm not a tax professional, but I've traded stocks for a few years and can at least tell you where to look (google bold items.) First, if you're currently receiving a refund when you file, you don't need to do anything unless you think your additional tax obligation will exceed your refund. Next, if you just have one really good year, so long as you're still paying the IRS the same amount, you don't have to worry about making additional payments during the year (**estimated tax payments** by the **1040-ES**) because you'd be covered under the **safe harbor rule**. If you're expecting consistent additional capital gains, you could increase your tax withholdings with your employer to offset the increase. Or, you could decide to do the 1040-ES forms and just send the IRS more money during the year.
Hope that helps.

That is BS to me. So if you mine coins you immediately have to recognize income? Would be a lot more fair to recognize a 'BUY' with $0 cost-basis on a given date, then when you sell, recognize the gain at that time.  Would suck to mine a bunch of blocks when the price is at 1,100 and hold until you needed money, but at that point the spot was $800. You could record a capital loss and get a small benefit, but I don't understand why it'd be immediately seen as income.  Anyone have any thoughts on why they're going this route?
@_date: 2014-03-24 16:29:45
You asked how else they might have been paying for interest without running on fractional reserve. The revenue is how else.
Now, *why* they would offer that does generally point to fractional reserve, but your original comment as it existed was a non-sequitur.

I certainly wouldn't take the other side of that wager. That run up to 1200 or so was a nutty outlier that's going to be screwing with peoples charts and technicals for a while to come. I'm not sure where BTC will be by year's end; I could give equal odds to 250-400 and 1300-1500. 
*edit: I will not eat my hat if I'm wrong. :P

What about the "shadow bitcoin" market, where people have interests in amounts held by a trustee. Some of those large addresses may hold funds for a large number of people whose share of it is tracked in a private database.

Also, I don't know that the pessimistic really dumped or cashed out. I think most people have gone from accumulation to holding. Most of the weak hands at this point are probably out and now that things are a bit less volatile I'm guessing they're on the sidelines hoping for a good entry price.

Just record your purchase date and amount in USD.  When you (or your heirs) do eventually sell, you need to be able to account for long term vs. short term gains, if the wash sale rule applies, and the cost basis of the lot(s) you're selling.

Normally I do not like logarithmic scales because they can skew perception, but as I thought about it, perhaps it is fair to use considering the adoption rate of bitcoin and its rate of change. Aside from that, interesting indeed. I did take your link and go to a 2 year and did see an pattern.. Sept '12, May '13, Jan '14.. goes up, stabilizes, then legs up again. Would be nice to see that pattern repeat itself...

Yeah, and it's not like vanity addresses are any more memorable or shorter.. it's a novelty that is now costing people money for taking unnecessary risks. I feel bad for the people who lost BTC to some wiseguy, but wallet security is one of the most important and fundamental concepts to understand when using cryptocurrencies.
