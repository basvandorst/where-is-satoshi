It was actually down for me about the time you posted this, but it appears to be working now.

Bitcoin is a hard market to get into now since difficulty is very high. I imagine it's not useful unless you are willing to drop a few grand on hardware.
You could try doing LTC which would be easier to earn coin with, but your current hashrate is going to take you no where. right now you'd be earning 0.32 LTC / Year with that hashrate. Which is around $1 a year. You are likely spending more money in power to mine than what it's generating.

Keep it and just keep an eye on bitcoin value. If it shoots up then you can choose to sell and make a profit or continue holding it incase it goes up further.

I'm not a big fan of their whole cloud mining thing. Though, I can see how it's a huge win for them. Personally I bought a few hashlets just to try them. They are all single MH/s and I just leave them alone. 
My biggest complaint here is that you don't actually earn the coin you are mining. I don't know about anyone else, but I'm not mining LTC because it's worth $4. I'm mining because I am hopping in six month it will be worth $10.
If you want my honest opinion on Gaw. I don't think they'll be going out of business soon. I also don't think they'll be around long either. I think they are just biting off a bit more than they can chew and in-turn it's causing customers to have poor experiences. Basically they are having growing pains.

Your numbers seem off. 35kh/s can't generate 1500 doge a day.  Also mining with a CPU/GPU is very hard on both devices. There is a solid chance they'll die on you after a short period depending on how much they mine. 
In short, you aren't doing any good by mining at that rate.
