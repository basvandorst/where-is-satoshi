You stole your friends money.  That's what happened.  Feel free to use this thread as evidence of your heartbreak and devastation though.  That's what it's for, right?
@_date: 2018-05-03 01:18:41
Sounds like some Mr. Robot shit.
@_date: 2018-10-22 23:45:30
I'm not particularly tech-savvy and I found it rather straight-forward.
@_date: 2018-10-22 03:45:33
Seriously.  I actually think of all other crypto projects right now, behind Bitcoin, Bisq is the most important.
@_date: 2018-10-21 20:56:57
Awesome news.  Once BISQ gains a foot-hold, there will be no coming back.  The banks will be disrupted.
@_date: 2018-06-04 03:20:02
This is the best exchange out there.  Wish it had more volume.
@_date: 2018-06-20 01:44:28
Will people please, please, start using Bisq.  YES, it is hard at first.  But it is better for the crypto-community as a whole.
@_date: 2018-06-04 03:20:14
Yes, it's legal, just pay your taxes.

He _literally_ just fucking explained it in the OP.

Not enough bandwidth at my house. :(

No price.  Clean.
Good job.

What's the issue with encrypting your keys (using something like Cryptomator) and storing that on the cloud?
If someone was able to crack that, then conceivably, Bitcoin itself could become compromised, so the loss is nil.

I expect it to become popular in the public utility/social economy spheres (e.g. pay per hour electricity, pay per minute ride-share).  Anything which can be charged more frequently than currently, would benefit from lightning payments.
Cell phone usage.  Heck, app usage could be a charge per use (think $0.0001 per function).

Thank fucking god.  He's the guy behind Satoshi Dice, right?
If yes, he fucked me out of hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Get fucking bent Voorhees.
@_date: 2018-11-17 17:01:08
Yes, I paid taxes.  Why am I an idiot?
@_date: 2018-11-17 04:25:12
I didn't know that, but I am pleased that he is able to see that people don't just forget these things.
Erik Voorhees is a scammer.  He deserves a full investigation, courtesy of the SEC.
@_date: 2018-11-17 03:40:49
Yeah, but he sold shares of Satoshi Dice on various sites (Havelock Investments being one).
He also fucked over tons of people when he sold the Company, made a fortune, and shareholders were left with bags.
I hope the SEC fucks him up the ass.
@_date: 2018-07-21 22:21:51
Probably not, he's a scamming piece of shit (I am a former Satoshi Dice share holder).  
I won't forget that.
@_date: 2018-07-22 16:41:30
A lot of this happened over at Bitcointalk forums and at shareholder websites (e.g. Havelock Investments) directly.  It was super shitty.
@_date: 2018-04-20 06:01:15
 What if they patented to protect BTC users and don't intend to use this patent?

Very bight future indeed!
