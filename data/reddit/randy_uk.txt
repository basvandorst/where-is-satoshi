Hello, noob question, but is it unusual for a transaction to take a few days? I sent some BTC to an exchange about 48 hours ago and I am still waiting for it to be confirmed. Should I be concerned?

Thanks for your replies, had 2 other transactions a few days earlier which took ~30 minutes each, this one however...!

Called my bank in UK and told them the situation, after being hold for a few minutes I am told 
"OK I have blocked your online account and if you can run a spyware scanner and then give us a call back we will unblock the account".......
I tell them someone already has my details and the security breach isn't on my system to which he says
"The spyware scanner should sort that out, and we can't see any suspicious activity on your account at the moment."
WTF really?

Lose* is what you want, loose is the opposite of tight.

It would only work if you have met him before, so then he could describe your appearance to his accomplice.  Without a prior meeting it would be much harder for them to guess who the person coming to buy bitcoins from them would be.

but how do you send bitcoins to a reddit username?
