A "secure" savings medium is one that won't lose you a large percentage of your savings all of a sudden just because somebody else decided to make a large withdrawal.

So your argument is basically, since the government created the Internet, you're a hypocrite if you use the Internet and advocate against complete submission to the government.

Cash belongs on the same side of the comparison as Bitcoin. You either use cash/Bitcoin and get scammed, or use a credit card and retain an option if you need it.
@_date: 2014-09-13 01:26:51
Don't worry. Criminals will use Bitcoin anyway because they have no other choice. This will provide at least some continued demand for Bitcoin.

That's an incredibly ironic statement. I mean, the advantage is there to be taken. For any hapless fool that would get caught up in such a scheme, it would be easy to convince you idiots that it was their own fault they got ripped off. You have to be stupid to think it wouldn't happen. There's simply no other explanation.

Consumers don't adopt Bitpay or Coinbase, merchants do.


If they believed that, they'd be doing it already.

I can withdraw my fiat money to the neutral pasture under my mattress any time I want, so that must mean that the traditional banking system isn't any more centralized than the Bitcoin ecosystem.
@_date: 2016-12-24 23:09:44
I've never had any trouble with Coinbase. You must be lying.
EDIT: When people tell *me* that, they usually get upvoted.

This happened with a TOR security bug that some researches bragged about without actually disclosing it. If you have something that greatly strengthens anonymity, and you announce that you have it but don't give out any further details, the US government will make sure those details  never see the light of day.

It's a screenshot from a 1979 arcade game superimposed on the chart. You can see the score and other info at the top, and the "4X" means you get quadruple the points if you can land on that spot.

You must personally know the Bear Whale.

Instead of bragging, they should just post the source code and the schematics. But of course the next guy won't learn this lesson either, so the rest of us get to continue having our security compromised. Yippee!

IOW, fucking big government, thinking it knows what's best for us, violated individuals' natural right to own niggers to work their fields, *and then* it went on to give those same niggers welfare checks (with money it was only able to steal from us because it controls the banking system), while making laws saying we have to treat niggers like white people. Bitcoin is gonna put those niggers back in the fields where they belong.

Here's an idea that might work better for someone of your caliber: Go ahead and buy that mansion, luxury car, yacht, or whatever with your unreported Bitcoins that you've made millions on, and then you can look like the fucking moron you are when the IRS comes to your door to ask how you could afford it given the little bit of income you reported on your 1040.
Have fun in jail, you stupid fuck.

There's not much point in being rich if you can't even spend a little money without going to jail, genius.
