Some news channels are more educated than others. This seems to be the low end of that scale.

Nicely done! I would most likely have said that these "nonsense coins" are just some peoples way to both pay homage to the Bitcoin protocol as well as showing the pointlessness in all the alt-coins.

It does not download the complete blockchain, this behavior is often preferable on thinner systems like laptops.

I really don't understand what the problem is for people. JUST LEAVE! Why aren't people leaving? And don't just go to BTC Guild. Pick one of the smaller ones below 10%.
@_date: 2013-10-16 17:22:29
I could not hear the word "Bitcoin" used once, therefore it seems like it's off topic. Please check the community rules.

Nice product. I wish I knew someone with a cat. :)

Public Service Announcement?
@_date: 2013-12-01 14:40:34
One of the best introductions, along with the obligatory FUD and the odd dinosaur.

Two thoughts:
First. About your website. It's pretty. But, the first thing I should see when I open your website is the "idea" or the "message" that you are selling. Since you are selling hemp products you obviously think that it's the greatest thing since sliced bread and therefore you go straight to displaying the products. But I don't know why I should care about hemp products, so therefore a list of products does nothing to me.
Remember that you have to lure the customer in. Use the prime space to sell an idea, a message, a mystery, a secret. It should make me curious to read more. Use few words, but let the words speak something that I understand even before I have completed the sentence. The Washington quote it good, maybe you could start from that.
Remember that very few people click the "About" page. That's something nerds look for.
When you have lured me in, you have to educate me. First of all: I don't even know what hemp is and why I should care. This should be clear for me even before I start scrolling.
There really is no one better than Apple at this. Study their websites, their commercials etc. 
Second. About bitcoin. I am starting to think that we no longer are in a place where we can support all new merchants that are accepting it. It was one thing when you pretty much only could buy alpaca socks, but nowadays it's starting to become a crowded market. I feel bad every time I scroll past a post about a new merchant, but it's a fact.
Anyway, good luck with your business!

Btw. That wedding video made me cry big time. I'm such a wimp. :P
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:10:56
So what if someone has mined since 2009 and made $20 000 000? Is that not rather common?
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:30:11
THIS! I wish my parents would have placed me in an advanced class when I was young. Treating a gifted kid this way is outrageous! Talk to your parents right away!
@_date: 2013-11-16 14:30:34
Great article! Really positive angle.

I'm not into photographing or video recording, but the product looks really nice. Would surely buy it if I would have any use for it. Good luck and keep it up.

Rick Falkvinge's blog post in 2011.

I really, really hope that the rest of the world doesn't think that Amir is representative for the Bitcoin community. He does have a lot of good points in this talk, regarding the decentralization of bitcoin development, and some clear references to Linux that are worth taking under consideration. But come on, leave the anarchy talk at home (or in your squat). It's very alienating and not the kind of face the community needs.

As I read this I am wearing Alpaca socks, paid for with bitcoin. They are nice this time of the year (at least in Sweden).

I don't think you fully appreciate the mind of a gambler. ;)

Nice guy. Polite, funny and open-minded.

I e-mailed them a week ago and asked them to correct this. I guess that I am not the first, nor the last to do so.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:56:09
I found reddit through Bitcoin, so I have never cared much for anything else here.
@_date: 2013-12-11 11:56:46
Awesome!! Too bad they don't have anything in my area... :(

It's in the nature of customer support that you never hear anything publicly from the 99 satisfied customers, but only from the 1 where something went wrong.

I guess that's a symptom of me getting older then, because I think she looks stunning! Could sit and watch her talk all day long.

Should it not be "cryptography" instead of "encryption"?

He got three pizzas for that price.

Neutral/Skeptical segment. Not very tech focused (and also not very well informed). Overall, I'm disappointed about the content but I am pleased to see the exposure. After all, this is the 21.00 news!
@_date: 2013-11-04 14:15:17
Paranoid or not, the first thing I think about when I see this is phishing; or rather spearphishing.
@_date: 2013-09-07 12:17:46
I like the simplicity of the interface. Keep up the good work.
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:28:52
Well, that's a matter of preference. Not all countries use comma to show thousands. For me everything behind a comma looks like decimals.
@_date: 2013-12-25 19:51:52
Maybe he's not from US. Most countries don't have that rule.
@_date: 2013-09-07 18:29:05
Nice! I know the feeling. The first time I got a donation it totally made my day. The amount did not matter, it was the fact that someone took their time to show some support.
@_date: 2013-12-20 06:43:58
Wow! Great segment! I love how your enthusiasm is showing Matt! This time you really took control of the studio.
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:22:14
Yes, I have also stopped talking about Bitcoin since it went over 300. Except now I finally told my family.

I would rather recommend Debian. Have a geek install it properly with full disk encryption and needed tweaks and enjoy having a stable system for 3-5 years.
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:04:21
And as usual, reading the comments makes it clear that Bitcoin is not anywhere near mass adoption. People don't really have a clue yet.
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:13:13
I don't understand how you can hide something like this from your wife. You are supposed to share everything with each other. That's my opinion.
I am however contemplating if it's wise to tell a girlfriend or a fiancee before marriage. Don't want to make it about the money...
@_date: 2013-09-16 05:55:05
Fantastic news! Armory really is top of the crop, and hopefully this goes a long way to help them keep it that way.

You made it sound as if you have to be licensed as a money transmitter to use bitcoin to buy things in the US.
Btw. Would it not be best to tell your co-workers to just shut up for 5 minutes and not ask any questions? Every time I see a clip with someone who knows what bitcoin is about, there is some other very nice person who has to ask all the wrong questions, all the time.
EDIT: Ok, so this time it wasn't that bad. But when it comes to the more technical parts of Bitcoin, just ask them to give you room to breathe. For me, it takes about 15 minutes to explain bitcoin to a new person (not talking about the elevator pitch).
@_date: 2013-12-13 14:44:10
My point making this comment was that any model except yyyy-mm-dd leaves room for misinterpretation. As usual, the american way of defining things is faulty.
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:37:18
...and he is very arrogant about it.
But then again, I don't think he cares about what's being said in a series of tubes laid out across the nations.
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:44:08
I am actually leaving as soon Bitcoin hits and stays stable over $10k. Then I'll be living out the rest of my life in a sunny place.
