Ah thanks a lot for clearing up my misconceptions! So miners signaling activation effectively has no bearing on whether Segwit will really be implemented? Also what is the communities major objections to the code changes if it isn't security? 
Thanks a lot for answering my questions man

That's the video I saw explaining the harms of SegWit - I'm not heavily involved in the bitcoin community but it definitely seems to me the Segwit decision is polarizing (more so than to one miner group losing an advantage). I don't have enough knowledge to say for certain anything, but to me it seems Segwit will alter fundamentally the bitcoins blockchain and I don't fully see the need to increase the block size since I feel network compensates for amount of mining power currently.

Segwit 2.0 still hasn't gone into effect - 99% chance it will this August since all the miners signaled (probably wouldn't result in a hard fork as a result). While I'm not a fan of Segwit, I think having a bitcoin core and bitcoin Segwit is a bad idea as fracturing the coin will just create more competition and halter growth.

Ah I didn't realize signalizing was non binding... but didn't the miners agree to SegWit because of the block increase? IMO Segwit is bad for security (not checking the private key signature on transactions for one) but only time will tell what will happen. Why would core accept the code changes and not take the bigger block size if core was against the code changes?
