Unfortunately not many people consider how ethical their business tactics are. "Good business" decisions and ethical approaches to business often aren't commingled. It's sad, really. If you strongly believe that patents shouldn't exist, then influence the right change with the right actions. No one ever changed the world by following along with the status quo. 
The actions of companies and executives within those companies say a lot about their character and future decisions they're likely to make when faced with a decision like "Do I do what's best for me, or do I do what's best for my users?". I wonder what Brian and others at Coinbase will choose to do when faced with that decision? Bitcoin will survive the selfish actions of Coinbase and others like them.

sounds like the opposite "ChangeTip indicated it is currently working on a "decentralized" version of its platform, where users are in control of funds. Currently, ChangeTip processes all bitcoin transactions off of the main bitcoin blockchain.
"We are moving small amounts of money, it's not feasible to have a 1/10th of a penny tip or micropayment to a publisher be an on-chain transaction," the company said.
Proposals are currently being considered by the company regarding how it could leverage payment channels on the proposed Lightning Network and other alternatives to further its support for bitcoin."

I think you still have a couple options - tipping them via G+ or posting to Tipworthy. Google broke their commenting notifications in general...
