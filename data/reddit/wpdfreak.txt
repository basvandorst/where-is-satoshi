A friend. Might check though to see if anything has changed. I did find some p2p exchanges recently but haven’t had the need. 
My suggestion if you have a trusted friend that can sell you it for fiat, do that. Otherwise just go p2p

Was considering this

Anyone have any additional updates about these people. I want to follow and see when this guy get's caught and not just because I got scammed (that was my fault, should have seen it), but because I want to see justice come to him. His site is still up just like before and he even showed his face, how arrogant!

Great to know, thank you! I'm glad they do that, for all the pros and cons to using coinbase, it's good know about this pro. I appreciate it!

I will be checking this out, thanks!
Edit: for the educational value :)

Thanks! Do you have anything else, his face is out there, what resource would you use to see for updates as to when he is ever caught..

For the discussion it's better to just take this as a given.

Are authorities likely to get them. I'll fill out the report, just curious as to what usually happens..
@_date: 2015-06-04 19:39:56
Okay that sounds neat and will definitely look into this so I can learn more. In finding out this isn't an issue if you use coinbase I still want this thread to be helpful for those those using other wallets.

That's an option, shady only because it's p2p and the other person could be shady.
