Hi there, I don't know an exact charity but donating to something that is working to push humanity itself forward I think would be a worthy investment. I love what you've done so far, but you might consider taking the Bill Gates route and having your own foundation manage the funds and where they go over the years, especially as Bitcoin continues to increase in value.

Crap, looks like I need to zero out my Binance balances before they crash.
@_date: 2018-08-21 17:14:36
I think I'll avoid it for now. Coinbase has a shaky past in this area.

Any good competitors?
@_date: 2014-04-29 11:30:02
Very cool.

What about a proxy pizza ordering service? 
@_date: 2014-03-10 13:46:16
What about detecting from source location? For example if traffic comes from then show the Bitcoin option,  then teamup with other known bitcoin sites like coinbase, bitpay, etc..

wow... and they didn't fire the guy/girl?

All of my clients pay via stripe, but I just started using coinbase for Bitcoin clients, I dont have any bitcoin clients yet but this might pose an interesting dilemma when/if I do.

Yup, it's based on psychology. The more options someone has the more likely they are to over think it. If you're interested in learning more look up "conversation optimization science".

Hi guys, total bitcoin noob here and professional SEO / digital reputation consultant. This is probably one of the worst attempts at reputation management I've ever seen, but I'm curious, what's the actual hatred on BFL for again? I remember when they opened up for preorders there was a lot of praise, but then a lot of hate.
Also, I see this move might help the bitcoin community by removing the jackass that has been spewing hate on it for so long, sure he got his payday but his reach will be significantly less now.
@_date: 2014-03-28 17:03:45
I'm guessing you could take pizza orders with like a 5% markup and place the order for someone else.

came here to say this. Video hosting is incredibly expensive. When I ran GamersTube we experimented with a tipping system using our own digital currency (gt coins) however, it was really difficult to build and secure and we would have lost money on it. I'd think Twitch or other smaller video providers might be a better fit for this kind of monetization, because they would see it as a marketing tactic not necessarily a revenue generator.

Op: as a marketer pushing this I love the idea, I have a few ideas for high profile targets if you want to talk.

If this is yours, pm me. Id love to help you with digital marketing.

I've been thinking about making a bitcoin only page. Thoughts?

Conservative Texan here, I agree with most of those points,  but I am ardent supporter of gun rights. How do you tend with people like me, a growing base here in tx?
@_date: 2015-08-22 23:22:03
I'd be interested to know what channels you find that accept bitcoin and are effective.
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:34:55
Stop using Google, they are doing this from a competitive angle. Start using DuckDuckGo or at least Bing. This story has happened with that same highly centralized corporation before when they went after startups building search retargeting adtech. After they laid waste to them all they built their own version.

Also work in Digital Marketing and working to get Bitcoins a bit more accepted here in Texas.
