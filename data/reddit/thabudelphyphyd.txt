It should be the only question.  Moreover, Bitstamp works in the UK.  They are not going to tolerate anything that threatens their financial services industry in their jurisdiction.

For all we know, half of the BTC trading volumes on Gox are fake.  I think it's likely they have a prop engine that is trading against their customers - in fact, I'm pretty sure all the exchanges do shenanigans like that.

Because if they go under, he's not going to get his money back.

I am not holding them to the bar of "regular private business".  I am holding them to the bar of a "financial exchange".  And, yes, every exchange opens their books.

10% still means there is a 10% chance they'll go bust.  That's hardly "confidence".

Actually, we don't really know that.  We have no information on their monthly expenses.  ...and given some of the capital investments they've had to make recently to scale (new servers, new employees, new ISP services, etc...) it is totally possible that they are using customer account money to finance themselves day-to-day.
In fact, that is essentially the opinion of the broader market - ie why Gox trades 20% higher than any other exchange.

Aside from the 20% haircut that would cost, it is important to realize that the collapse of the main BTC exchange would have a pretty shitty impact on the price across ALL exchanges.   Moreover, we would likely see some other exchange failures as they wouldn't be able to handle the volume of withdrawals themselves.
It is better to know now and perhaps refund people what money they have left in an orderly way, than wait for a total collapse.
We really want to minimize the volatility on the BTC price because the kind of vol we've been seeing make BTC not usable by merchants.  ...and if merchants aren't using it, then this currency is all for nothing.

All major exchanges, globally, report a number of important metrics publicly and to the regulators.   Including their own balance sheets, cash flow statements, and income sheets, quarterly - as well as a variety of DAILY margin and leverage reports, customer account segregations (as segregated from exchange accounts) to the SEC and global equivalents.  The reporting requirements (literally hundreds of them) for exchanges are significant and costly, but without them, these Wall St fuckers would have stolen everyone's money years ago.

His statement actually had almost zero details.  It was the catalyst that actually made me pull my money OUT!

Do you really trust any of the exchanges?
@_date: 2013-08-27 16:09:31
It may not be.  Honestly, I'm not sure - but I doubt the existing exchanges will not survive.  ...so it's just a warning.
