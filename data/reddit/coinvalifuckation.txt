You *did't feel bad about it* because it crashed a bit, and you were able to buy back in. In other words, you got lucky (even if you deluded yourself enough to imagine that you're a trading genius).
But what if it didn't drop at all after you sold? How would you feel then? What if you sold at 300 and sometime in February we're at 1500?
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:02:17
Ahh, technically you're right. But my point is that even at 200 at the time people were talking bubble because we had jumped so much, so quickly from 120.

I bought at the all-time high of 200 just weeks ago (not my first purchase). Then I bought at 160 and 180 during a flash crash that lasted hours. I was pretty happy about that.
I bought at 250 during an all-time high. I'm pretty happy about that.
I bought at 350 during an all-time high. I'm pretty happy about that.
I'll still be buying at 1,000 and 10,000 and I expect I'll be pretty happy about that as well.

Well there was that one dude who maxed out all his credit cards out to buy 30k of bitcoin at around ~10, and within a year had achieved 10x his investment and paid off the cards in full. If he held the rest he'd be at a 50x jump today.

Fuck them too.

Yeah, I said that being as conservative as possible. Numerous bitcoin experts have said they truly expect 1k coins by Dec. 31 and my skepticism about that has almost vanished.
P.S. when I said 600 I was thinking Coinbase price, because I'm American, etc.
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:53:44
Why are people so worried about *strangers*? The paranoia in America is just so weird.

We'd like to see your whitepapers please.

So exciting--just made a fair sized purchase. We'll see 600+ tomorrow for sure.

Would you care for some Grey Poupon?
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:18:42
Some know. But there are a whole lot who don't know yet and will hop on to buy more as soon as they find out.

It's a flash crash. You emotional peeps are going to feel foolish in a few hours.
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:25:57
Yeah, this is why you don't touch your *savings* to buy that sandwich. 
You buy X number of bitcoin with fiat every month that you will use to pay for daily/monthly expenses like food.
It's the best of both worlds. Bitcoin savings secure? Check. Supporting the bitcoin community? Check.

I believe this is correct--but it would have to happen soon before the whitelist gained enough traction.
What percentage of coins would be needed for just the U.S. to implement a mandated whitelist within its borders? I don't think it would take much, so whatever that number is, we need to beat it before the government is able to integrate everything.
Thankfully, government is usually very slow in doing things like this.
