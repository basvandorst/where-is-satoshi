Can anyone help explain to me the difference between how miners get rewarded for solving the equations while also verifying each transaction, whereas all other users of the protocol verify each transaction that takes place anyway? I must be getting it wrong but do both ordinary users AND miners verify transactions?

What if you buy at different prices though? For example if you bought one bitcoin at 1k, another coin at 2k, and another coin at 3k - all in one year. You’ve spent 6k USD and have 3 bitcoins. Then you sell say one coin at 10k, so you’ve made a 4k gain that year for the purposes of CGT? Then what if you sold another coin the following year at 20k, what gain would you make that year?

I know dat feel bro. Well, kinda. I wanted to buy at 35. Eventually bought at 90 (a measly 3 bitcoins). So exciting!

Same here bro. College student with not a lot of money but enough to buy 3 coins at 90$ each. I had heard of it a year or two ago when my brother began using it but was pretty ignorant to it. When the price started jumping I got really into it and started learning. It's not even about the money for me anymore, it's just really exciting to see where it goes.

YES! Just watched this the other night. It's incredible how so many features are lying dormant still. The level of foresight Satoshi had for this is incredible.
