Google Translate's renderings of this article make the author seem insufferably cheerful and confused. I'm going to learn to talk like this:  
"Bitcoin long-term existence of the long run, Bitcoin is a certain appreciation of the ordinary knowledge of economics will be able to understand. Which became today Bitcoin so crazy one important factor!"

I think people are smart enough (with some notable exceptions) not to be obsessed with the nominal value of their bitcoins. Just as we've all got used to the epithet "millionaire" carrying far less weight than it did in Jed Clampett's day thanks to inflation, we'll get used to "thousandaire" status going from no big whoop to something fairly uncommon as the purchasing power of bitcoin increases. It's not rocket surgery.

If it were adopted by the porn industry, there would be no stopping it.

Can anyone give a rough summary of the article? And how easy is it for Chinese citizens to actually buy bitcoin?

Kind of obvious now that you mention it. Thanks.

I'm not sure it's relevant either, but I'm not sorry I read it.

I sold on CaVirtex moments ago. Does this mean I get to buy them back even cheaper after the panic selling?

Dude, I'm not missing your point, I'm disagreeing with you. There's a difference. 
When I buy a stock and it appreciates in value, I have increased my savings with no increase in the number of shares I own. I feel like I have increased my holdings nonetheless.

Yep.
