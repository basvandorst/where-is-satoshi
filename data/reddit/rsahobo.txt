I doubt Facebook’s Libra will actually take off and become the world currency they hoped they would, Mark is about 5 years too late for that, many countries will ban Libra making it ultimately useless to what it wanted to be.

Possibly the best way of crypto advertisement. A journalist should ask POTUS every week about crypto.

I know it doesn't exist yet and I know it'll get a lot of trouble from regualtors, but still the news of it was popular
@_date: 2019-07-27 13:00:12
Been there, done that, bought the expensive Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-10 18:34:40
In the mean time, Libra is popular.

Why would you keep your paper wallets in your printer?

I spent $3000 on a mining rig during the $20 000 BTC boom, when it dropped electricity became to much, sold the rig for half of what I paid.
@_date: 2019-06-25 15:18:35
don't you mean private keys?
@_date: 2019-06-18 14:43:38
So bitcoin.org is the real deal.
@_date: 2019-06-25 10:01:48
Think he'll accept BTC for Libra?

Oh I know, think I noticed last week. After a while you see the difference between the 2 groups, they should change the sub group name thoug, unfortunately r/shit coin is already taken.

@_date: 2019-05-28 09:43:04
Dis you use your BTC to pay for this time traveled? Or which alt coin is top in 2030?
@_date: 2019-05-24 17:07:56
If we are looking at a $100 000 per BTC, what effect will this have on a fallen dollar? Referring to the 2019 financial crash. Like, how much worth would a BTC be worth. If I'm not coming through clear, just lemme know.
@_date: 2019-05-29 05:58:55
Well if you look at the adoption and the networks being built onto altcoin platforms....it will be a little stupid to believe they won't exist in 10 years.
@_date: 2019-05-03 14:02:26
so smart it's HODL
@_date: 2019-05-22 04:27:54
Aaaah, "I want the dollar", why? "Because I don't know anything about bitcoin but I know a lot about the dollar." - these genx pussies are retards
