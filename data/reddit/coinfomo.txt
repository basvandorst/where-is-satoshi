I just launched the site yesterday and I hope it's a fun "what if" calculator for people. It started off as just a hobby project because I wanted to figure out how much I could have made if I invested earlier. I came up with a couple other calculators like how much a coin might be worth given its supply or how much all the coins would be worth if the market cap increased to the January 2018 highs. I figure if I wanted to know then other people might want it too. Let's all get rich together :)

The coinfomo "market" page shows a "what if" price for each coin so you get a realistic idea of what it "could be" in the future given its supply.  It's not a crystal ball but it helps people who think their penny coins will be worth thousands one day :)

That is a really good question and I have thought a lot about it too.  These are my guesses =)
1) You spend it on something that may increase in value faster than bitcoin
2) You invested early and are spending your profits so it does not feel like a loss
3) You are having trouble or tax issues with converting back to fiat so you use it whenever possible at locations that accept it

hahahaha, no behind-the-scenes mining and completely free of malware =)  I got infected a few times with coinhive malware while I was researching coins. It's dangerous out there in the "wild-west" of crypto sites.

I would love to get people to use it :)  I just launched yesterday and I am not sure how to promote it.  Any ideas?
