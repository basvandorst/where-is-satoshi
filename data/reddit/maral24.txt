Consider that the people who've bought into Bitcoin recently are of a different type than in 2015. Back then it might have been "converted believers" - but in the past months it's probably more "greedy speculators". The more the people coming on board now show different agendas &amp; actions than the earlier adopters, the less of a predictable pattern you will have in that graph. Do you think a car driving slowly with 2 passengers will behave the same as one driving at high speed with 10 people on board? Also, with BTC value having increased so much, the stakes are higher and people more on edge - probably leading to increasingly rash &amp; erratic actions.

All graphs based on financial data ultimately show the results of people's actions (even if software - designed by people - does some of the trading, based on e.g. stop-losses also set by people) - and while people's actions might not be random, that doesn't mean what they will do (and what the resulting graphs will show), is predictable.
As an analogy: think of your graph as a road on which you are driving for the first time. If you don't have a map for that road, you won't know what to expect - even though the road was built by people. If, say, after 50 miles you realize that there was a sharp turn to the left every two miles for the past 20 miles, does that mean you can predict the next turn? The road might turn again, but in the opposite direction. Or it might now carry on in a zig-zag line for another 50 miles. Even if you knew the general direction and ultimate destination of that road, you have no way of predicting all the twists and turns it might take along the way...
