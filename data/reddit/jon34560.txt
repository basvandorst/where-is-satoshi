A lot of the details of the system were kept secret but one interesting thing is that the flash drives (wallets) were apparently custom hardware. They were not standard flash drives. I have a couple of them... 
The system was limited by maximum balance and transaction count maximum (The hardware could be reset after reaching 100 transactions I think). Almost like a prepaid card. I never liked this aspect of it.

When dollars are issued as a loan with interest attached there must always be an influx of new currency to pay the interest on the existing dollars. If there wasn't inflation (of supply) in a fractional reserve system all dollars would quickly evaporate to pay existing interest. That is also why in a FR currency deflation is so bad.

Ok thanks for the detailed answer.
@_date: 2019-04-07 01:38:42
Would you say personal freedom to own and trade property and capital is the root of the problem? I.e. the more freedom people have the more ability there is for people to act badly. People make this claim about bitcoin in another way in that criminals use it. Where a less utilitarian dollar system restricts ownership and trade under circumstances that don’t exist in btc. 
My opinion is that capitalism (an individuals right to own and trade property) shouldn’t be restricted because of some users commuting crime, I believe the bad behaviours should be individually addressed. 
@_date: 2019-04-07 09:06:13
What is the definition of capitalism then? What’s what I see when I look it up. My understanding is that private rights of the individual to poses capital and its trade is capitalism. 
I hear what you are saying but any group of individuals can freely of their own accord start their own corporation if they want to take on more responsibility. Most people want safety and security over that responsibility though. Corporations make sense to me because the amount of taxation private individuals would have to pay to buy things make products and sell them would be astronomical. People and their families lives depend on profit to survive. It sounds like your talking about public companies maybe not nessissarily mom and pop stores.
I agree with you about war for sure.

What is the problem with capitalism? I see it has played a role in the greatest advance of society and quality of life in the history of man kind. 
I know some problems with coal power including cancer and pollution but I’m not clear on what your analogy has to do with capitalism vs the bad behaviour banks, corporations and individuals can enact. 
It sounds like you are equating capitalism or the right of an individual to own and trade with a bad polluting source of energy? Do you see any virtue in the functionings of a society running on capitalism?
I probably agree with you on all of the bad things people in our society can do but I’m not clear on where you draw the line between what people should and shouldn’t be allowed to do. 
When I hear people say capitalism is bad I have no idea what could possibly be changed to remove capitalism and still have people in society engage and survive. 
Edit: maybe I should have started with this. The reason that I am responding when you say capitalism is bad is that I don’t understand what you mean. And I would like to know what is it that changes when you a) change capitalism so that it isn’t bad or b) what can people own, trade and do in a collective society when capitalism is not allowed.
Thanks

@_date: 2017-09-07 04:00:22
Yeah, and it is true that a lot of people don't want to spend it for the reason that the price will go up but some people are buying things with it. The point I make is that if Bitcoin was to continue to grow and be used more as a currency the negative effects of deflation don't apply to Bitcoin in the same way they apply to a dollar based economy.  
Edit: Spelling.
@_date: 2017-09-07 04:17:47
Good for you. Regarding how much to invest I suppose you will have to find an amount that is comfortable for you. I personally put between 50-90% of my spare income towards BTC each paycheque and the rest to cash or other investments. The key for me is that I chose the ratios based on how much I already have and my comfort level with an expectation of long term future growth. 
To help you choose I would actually recommend that you read about all of your investment options and the strategies others use even if they are not what you decide on. I'm reading Tony Robins book Money master the game and while it is long it is exceptionally helpful in this regard.

In the past it has usually been better to buy currency than to mine it. If you want to mine you probably expect the price to stay the same or go up and if that is the case buying will front load your holdings. 
I mined Eth for two weeks last year and it is now worth 10K but if I had just bought at the time at $120 worth I would have been ahead.  
@_date: 2018-02-27 21:27:27
Sounds like a good play to me. My article basically makes the porposition that it is a goo d idea to accumulate because in a few years the price will be much higher than it is now. The unique contribution is to buy and sell small portions when the market is in extream highs and lows. 
There are several people I know that bought Bitcoin at the peak in 2013 and have a very negative outlook on it. I think being aware of periods of high runups can be a risky time to buy.

Oh sorry for the poor explanation. I ran the report yesterday but they way I look for the past comparison date is to use 3 and 6 months of daily data.

@_date: 2018-12-01 03:19:45
This projection is independent of reaching the bottom yet. It does this by factoring in the direction of the market trend, in other words if the market is falling it uses past markers where the market is also falling. This means that projections when the market is dropping will always be farther out than markets that are rising. When the market is falling it just takes more time to level out and come back the other way.

@_date: 2018-12-07 21:26:20
I run a report on the relative price drop from past highs and count the number of days it took to go back up to an all time high and average them together. I use the current price drop ratio from the past high as well as the trend direction so that when markets are going down it only uses data from past points when the market was also going down. And vice versa. This is because a market going down takes more time to bottom and reverse passing the same values. Currently my report shows the average past data at the current levels took 439 days to reach the next high. Projected forward that would land on Feb 20, 2020.

Interesting idea. What I might do is run a back test against the entire history and plot the accuracy on a graph.

All dollars are issued as debt with interest attached. The currency to repay that interest was and is not ever created. You keep digging yourself deeper into this hole that is your argument. You owe 1% to the bank that does not exist, If you can get that from someone else good for you. But the last guy standing unable to make a profitable loan is SOL. It doesn't matter what you invest that loan in, any customers paying with dollars will also have their own interest charges attached. The more loans and dollars you add to the scenario the larger the debt associated with it grows... I say this with love for the benefit of your understanding or at least amusement.

This seems like backwards thinking to me. People rely on an economy more when their savings are diluted by inflation. The overall positions people hold should be more important than the speed of currency movement. 
I would say policies that optimize the best result for everyone are better than ones that promote fast motion. Ultimately the supply of resources and labor is independent of the current monetary policy and the best policy would allow people to save, spend and invest with others having the least friction. Taking purchasing power is a major source of friction. 
Edit: re: backwards thinking. 
To me your well being depends on your financial position and your financial position depends on income from an economy. Taking away from your financial position is more detrimental to your well being even when it helps the economy because the benefit of an increased economy is a lower order factor. 
Unless you think that forcing people to spend creates a bigger advantage to people than would naturally occur (i.e. increases productivity). I'm curious about your thoughts on this. I assumed that the devaluation would at best be equal to any gain.

That's how I read that too.

I have a question about this system. Does this flag addresses not coins? If you accept a payment from an address that is flagged you become flagged as well. And you can take yourself of the list by calling the registry. 
That sounds like a lot of work for something that doesn't add any real validation.

This is interesting for me because I am working on a Bitcoin based startup and participated in the RCM Mint Chip challenge. My team didn't win anything though :)  We did leave most of it to the last minute and I filmed the video at midnight on the deadline submission date:(
MintChip isn't a currency though it's just a digital wallet that is limited in dollar capacity (just a few hundred dollars) and has a hard limit on the number of transactions you can do. 
My criticism of MintChip is and was that no one can use it. I'm hoping that will change one day but for now Bitcoin is where my time goes...

Over the years I have offered to give people bitcoin and only a few accepted. The ones that did were excited when the price went up but as far as I know never bought any more. Some people call me asking how to sell bitcoin for cash and that coincidently happened at the low periods. Interestingly the responses from people declining were, no, no way it’s used for drugs, why would I want bitcoin? 
A co worker once made a couple hundred dollar gain and promptly sold and used the money to take his girlfriend out for dinner. 
One person I know did buy more btc and kept it. He seems to be an exception.
@_date: 2013-09-27 21:15:53
I did agree.

They have to do this. The more mining hardware they sell the smaller the return on future hardware will be. The mining business can't scale beyond a certain saturation level unless I'm missing something...

This is not strictly accurate. 90+ percent of all money is created by private banks through the FR system.
@_date: 2013-10-17 03:56:22
I don't mean to be rude. I'm happy to read your comments and hear your thoughts on this. It seems we have different understandings of the system. 
My understanding is that in our example the 1% interest payment was never created, only the principal was created. And while there are plenty of dollars around they are not free agents, they have their own interest attached. They had to be loaned into existence. 
To your other point I am also under the impression that "even if all money was debt" it would not be payable because the only currency that exists is principal not interest. If this is not the case I'd like to look into a source...
I don't quite understand what you mean by this: 
"what you seem to say that not only all money is debt, but there's some debt that is not money;"
When I say the interest owing is non existent I mean that it was never created and requires more borrowing, I'm not suggesting that it is not classified as currency. Is that what you were driving at?
Thanks

I would discount 10% with BTC. $6K is my opening offer.
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:44:13
I don't think you have to compare what a Bitcoin economy can look like to our current one. I also don't think you need to have credit to have a fast growing economy. The reason it grows is because people agree to exchange time and resources, that should be possible with Bitcoin. Instead of dealing with debt for motivating growth, investments could be made leveraged on equity shares for future returns for example. I.e. an example of how expanded growth could manifest is instead of a borrowers promise to repay with interest a project could be attract resources with the promise of future returns... Just one thought...

So, is it the case that there is so much hashing hardware headed to the market that no hardware will reach ROI regardless of the $/hash?

By that logic you could blame anyone for not buying in...
@_date: 2013-11-06 23:34:10
Right. The concept of intrinsic value depends on being able to relate to others. The intrinsic value of you or your gold, dollars or business would be worthless if they were teleported to mars and cut off from everyone else.
@_date: 2013-04-21 18:10:02
Sorry to hear about that. I'm happy for you though.
If I was in your position the worst part for me would be a betrayal of trust from family.

I don't think you are correct. Taking out a loan requires that loan to be paid back with interest. But the interest was never created so you have to borrow more to pay the interest...
@_date: 2013-11-06 23:30:10
The ability of the US to force people to use the dollar does not give it (dollar) value in the sense he compares the intrinsic value of BTC.  
Bitcoin is the opposite of fiat, not the literal sense. I don't think that word means what he thinks it means....

I think BFL is going to have a ruff year in 2014. I just punched in the specs for the 600GHs card into:  Assuming the current BTC price, If you don't get that card in your hands this month your sitting on a loss. There is no price reduction that could make up for the difficulty increase assuming it stays at current rates.  
I have a 60Ghs unit and one in the mail that was six weeks late (better than never) I ordered over thirteen months ago. I expect to make back a few hundred dollars. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 02:09:09

Canada used a national central bank from 1934 to 1973 without incurring a large debt or creating high inflation. The loans were required to be paid back within a certain period of time. I put a website up with some information:  
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:55:47
I'm not clear on this. My understanding is that dollars are entities so you can attach a flag to them: clean/not clean. But with Bitcoin only the addresses are entities the coins themselves are fluid. It would be like putting a post-it on the surface of the ocean to mark the water from your glass / (warning: may contain backwash). So the analogy should follow that any person that receives a 'not clean' bill would be flagged not the bill. Can anyone correct me? 
@_date: 2013-10-17 02:26:35
The point I took away is that if more than 10% of bank deposits are withdrawn at once the bank will not be able to comply. In that scenario most people would consider it stealing...

It's fairly loud and I'm moving soon so I don't want to baby sit it. Because there aren't many in the wild I'm looking to see if there is interest... I'm perfectly happy to keep it.
@_date: 2013-10-17 04:29:15
I actually did read your comment and was going to comment but decided not to. It stands on its own. 
This does remind me of a great book by John Perkins called confessions of an economic hitman. In it he describes this scenario but instead of nations citizens working off debt to bankers it usually takes the form of forfeiture of natural resources...
@_date: 2013-10-16 23:33:54
No, that doesn't address the issue, it would be better for you but someone else now has to pay %2 with currency that was never created. If you allocate your unpayable debt to someone else the system still accrues more debt than currency. 
@_date: 2013-04-20 02:20:42
This is very cool. I have been following the OpenRisc project for years. I wonder if the products will be open source?
@_date: 2013-11-06 23:16:16
I don't understand what you mean by this... I presume that the value is going up because people can trade between BTC and currency. Currency for one is BTC for another it's the same just in different hands.
