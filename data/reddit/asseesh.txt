Jio is telephone network owned by Reliance Industries. It was launched last year which gave users unlimited access to calls and data for 6 months initiating a bloody price war between telecom companies. 
I doubt they will launch a crypto so most likely it is fake news.

Explain why is this should not be used?
This will be easier for me to exchange for fiat and donate immediately. 
If there is security issue, I can provide the address of private wallet as well. 
Thanks.

Well, use the time to learn how to be less stupid and not to fall for them?

Donation != Begging

Ah well. I should have deleted it anyway. Received some pretty great racist comments. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 20:46:22
I understand. That's why I mention that you can skip if you skeptic.

Payment banks are different category (private eWallets). 
What you meant is Jan Dhan Yojana bank account (roughly comman man's account). These accounts can be opened in any bank and doesn't have any minimum balance limitation ( also known as Zero account balance AC), can be opened only by AADHAR number. It comes with basic term insurance and accidental insurance ( upto $3000 for premium of ~ 5$ a year)
It enabled government to bring people with no bank accounts in past to mainstream and enabled them to transfer the benefits (such as wages and subsidies) to bank account directly and remove middlemen.
And yes, UPI is revolutionary.
Sending money digitally was not an issue with Indians (few people use it). IMPS (predessor of UPI ) was fast enough. It sends money to any bank account in real time, cheap (~ .08$ for any amount, even free in many banks). But requires 2 different (and long ) numbers and codes to send money.
With UPI they introduced VPA( virtual payment address). It's syntax is "abc  (like an email).
Just open the app, type the amount and VPA, authenticate via PIN and done. 
What's amazing is VPA is just one way to send money on UPI platform. You can pay via QR code, to mobile phone number linked with bank account or AADHAR number. The last one enabled payment just by fingerprint authentication. 
And you may not need internet for that. Works without internet as well.
That's why bitcoin in India will not be adopted as currency by mass because it doesn't solve any problem for us. Other than ofcourse, privacy. 
AADHAR is getting a lot of flak for privacy now.

Great. It seems pretty easy to follow. Thanks for help

Laughed too hard when it says blockchain can be hacked. Those words link to article about news of hacks of exchange shows exactly how much research was put into this. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 10:10:23
Damn. India is way ahead of you guys. I transfer money in real time between bank accounts FREE of COST (I do have premium accounts but transaction cost is  less than $0.10) and banks are innovating really fast here.

Use Jaxx for altcoins but not Bitcoins. The fees is always higher and not manually  editable which is not right at many levels. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:37:19
They hack the exchanges. Exchanges are just like banks that holds everyone's money in their accounts and just shows what they owe you. It's like robbers steal the money saved in bank's lockers. Hence, one should not hold their cryptos on exchanges.
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:03:46
I don't think so exchanges also let you manually assign fees to transactions as they club many transactions. I use electrum wallet and it let me assign any fee I want to.
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:12:56
Hahah. Don't come to India. Indian government doesn't like anonymity and "aren't comfortable " with Bitcoin. Indian  bureaucracy will fuck him more than china.
@_date: 2017-09-24 09:53:48
Thanks. That is good explanation

I am mentally prepared for price to go to $0. 'Coz I didn't invest more than I can afford to lose. That's most important thing.

ELI5 how those contracts are made and executed?

There will only be 21 millions Bitcoins ever. Right now there are 16M in circulation with 12.5 mined every 10 minutes on average. This will drop to 6.25 by 2020 and last Bitcoin will be mined in year 2140. Hence there is scarcity inbuilt in the system

It is hilarious if you thing this "cash crunch" has anything to do with cryptocurrency.
There are elections in one state next month and that can be much plausible reason. 
Wedding season has started this week and cash required for 50 medium sized wedding can easily surpass monthly (high) demand for cryptos. (very liberal estimation). There can be more than 25,000 weddings on given day of season in city of Delhi alone, you can only imagine what that number will be throughout India.

No. 
In a country of 1.25Billion, 5 million people hold cryptos. A major chuck of them got on board during recent boom and only exposure they have is exchanges. Most of them haven't even heard localbitcoins, BISQ or can't even tell what is blockchain. Most of them will either sell during next price boom or book the loss.
Indians don't have any impact on crypto's price. 
Indians love to hoard cash in their homes and after currency ban, they have been trying to get back the cash from banks, which is again causing currency shortage in market. 
"Unusual demand" is just the reason govt gave. The demand wasn't "unusual", its banks who have failed to maintain good supply in ATMs. The demand actually increased yesterday after the news broke that cash isn't available. Bank branches are still able to meet the demand.

A lot has changed in India since Nov 2016 in cryptos. Back then, there were not many options to buy them in India and few that existed were selling at premium - as high as 20% even before Nov 2016. Also, that means few people trading were using international exchanges to do so. 
This situation was like this till sept 2017, when Indian exchanges came into existence and Indian "market" was created. No. of exchanges grew from 2 to 10 with 20 more in pipeline within 3 months. The "premium" finally eroded and the prices became almost equal to international price on normal day. 
Last week, when RBI announced the ban on banks to do any business with crypto exchanges, the prices in India were as low as 25% less than international average. 
This is enough evidence to conclude that Indian market/news have zero impact on prices internationally.
