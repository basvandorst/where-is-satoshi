In terms of sex workers, she's probably one of the more advanced in the space. It's very interesting to hear her perspectives on how crypto helps solve some of the issues she's dealt with.

It makes you look unintelligent and people will gloss over your posts if you type like that leading to less informative responses.  Due diligence pays off.

I was 12 when I opened my first account with a parent as a co-owner. From there I got a paypal card and used it like anyone else would.  Merchants don't check your age from a credit card number.

Exactly!  This a trial run that they are evaluating instead of ads.  TPB has some awful ads too as most people aren't okay advertising on torrent site.  I'd much rather donate a small % of CPU power that I'm not even using.

Coinbase is an exchange, not a wallet.  You can store cryptocurrency in an exchange, but there are risks.

Absolutely.  This is what most would recommend.  Buy with Coinbase and then transfer to a wallet.  This is what I do now.  I don't keep a large amount in Coinbase.

Yup, driver's license will bump you up quite a bit from the ridiculous level of $150.

There is serious money to be made on something that helps with the tax mess in crypto, but I think it's almost too complicated for an easy solution.
