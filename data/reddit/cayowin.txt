The law got changed when the HK stuff hit the fan. HK is a major route for Forex leaving china. 
Basically Chinese citizens with a bit of cash do the following 
1) open account in HK based in USD.
2) Find an international company that buys Chinese goods
3) buy the goods for them in China using local yuan, 
4) get them to pay USD into HK account.
Funds moved from China to USD. Now use the money to buy an asset, like property, in USA or Europe.

The limits are set according to the USD value, regardless of what currency you want.

The amendment on foreign currency restriction took a tougher stance for individuals who hold a Chinese bank card to withdraw money overseas, the annual limit was set at 100,000 yuan ($15,355) per person -- no matter how many cards a person has.
Travelers are allowed to take up to US$5,000 equivalent of foreign currency and 20,000 yuan of local currency into or out of the country.
Amounts up to US$10,000 will require a Permit for Taking Foreign Currency Out of the Customs Territory issued by a bank. Anyone who takes more foreign currency than US$10,000 is required to show a legal warrant issued by agencies of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE).
For travelers who leave the country a second time within 15 days, the limit of foreign currency is US$1,000.

That sounds like something on the internet. China doesn't have the same internet you do.

China has banned it's citizens from with drawing more than 1000 USD per overseas trip. 
My mother in law has to work out how to travel Greece for 2 weeks on 1000. She is hoping her credit card will work when she gets there.

It's the euro equivalent. Basically China is restricting Forex access.

Ok, the China Communist party runs china. They tell the banks what they are and are not allowed to do. If CCP says no money with drawn outside china then you can't, no matter what card you with.
Visa and MC exist in China but only since loosening up of access to china. Unionpay and alipay are the standards.

Chinese cards?
@_date: 2019-08-17 13:55:28
Yes and no. Most local ATM in China (except tier 1 cities) use unionpay. Visa, MC and  diners are new to china. Local banks only issue visa and MC on special occasion. Locals don't want them cause can't use them locally, cost more. Most young just have alipay on phone and don't use plastic.

China doesn't use visa. Uses unionpay.
