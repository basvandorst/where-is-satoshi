I’m asking you to educate me of the real reason why we can’t take a shortcut measure to end this mess as soon as possible. You know any reason other than what I have mentioned, bring it on, otherwise, you can’t tell me I have not done my research or I am shilling for bch. I have invested in BTC and I want it to succeed, but all I see on this sub is a cult like atmosphere smothering any legitimate debate.

Why would anyone in the community be against temporary solutions to removing high fees and delays which don’t hurt Bitcoin much?

Who has set these rules on hard forks? I guess it is just a matter perception about hard forks, otherwise there are hard forks on the altcoins left and right that go smoothly and don’t change a lot of things. But when it comes to BTC, it is perceived to be a big No No!
But you are right about the test time, however, I don’t think it should be as big of a deal for just an increase in block size. It is so easy that Satoshi himself saw a trivial block size increase as the answer to scaling (I don’t argue whether he was right) all I am saying, block size increase is not that hard.

That's the part I am worried about, if it gets outlawed its value will crash to under $1000
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:09:12
Could you please let me know why you think that?

Imagine tomorrow btc exchange is banned in the US, wouldn't its value crash to under $1000?
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:33:29
How can you easily exchange it to dollar when it is outlawed?
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:27:18
If you can't exchange btc with dollar, it will lose a lot of value and decentralization would not help in anyway preventing that.

As easily as how they banned poker in the US, by cutting bank transactions facilitating btc exchange. Yes, you can exchange btc outside US then, but this difficulty makes btc value crash.

Thanks, let me see how it works.

I thought I had saved the private key, but in reality I had saved the wrong private key.
@_date: 2017-09-17 22:07:47
Yeah, no luck.
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:30:21
Haha you are awesome. It's not worth it now, just 0.1 btc.
@_date: 2017-09-17 22:22:28
Thanks, but the situation is more complex than that. I saved the wrong address and private key. I fucked up but there was a fuck up on bitaddress.org, too.
