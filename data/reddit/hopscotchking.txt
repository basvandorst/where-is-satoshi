Back over $10k let’s fucking goooo

Well, yeah, dude. ATH was unsustainable. It was driven by hype. These market cycle extremes are pretty normal tbh. Check out BTC’s 5 year or all time chart. Shit steadily rises. The ones who are patient will (most likely) be rewarded.

Bear? We went from $3100 to nearly $14000 in like seven months. We’ve found a little stability now around $9600 or whatever. I think I’m very realistic when it comes to crypto, and im usually not all that bullish, but this is absolutely not a bear.
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:53:55
Cool. I downloaded coinbase an hour ago. Checking it out now. Thanks for the explanation. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:45:56
Complete noob, not trolling. 
Can I buy bitcoin normally on my Fidelity app like my AMZN stocks or do I have to use something specifically for bitcoin? Finally thinking about maybe taking the plunge...
@_date: 2018-05-05 19:09:06
Yup. My buddy and I have a bet going about when BTC will break ATH and we’re using Coinbase as the exchange. 
$9927.99 is what I’m seeing, and that ain’t $10k. 
@_date: 2018-10-30 16:35:52
Negative. Got a link?
@_date: 2018-10-30 16:45:06
Haha nice I’ll keep my eyes open. I also noticed Amazon Prime is now live streaming NLF games. That’s cool. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 01:40:38
You’re going to win that bet. 
@_date: 2019-08-14 23:22:58
@_date: 2018-06-27 08:17:09
Got out of REQ at $0.18. Better late than never. 
I’ll rebuy if it hits $0.05. 
@_date: 2019-08-29 12:31:09
That’s a decent joke

Lol where on Piedmont is this? Is it still there? Last week I saw a Bitcoin ATM in the Buddy’s gas station on Highland Avenue. I’ve been looking for some crypto meetup groups around the city - do you know of any?
@_date: 2019-08-24 09:06:48
I dated a girl last year that asked me how to get “a bitcoin”. She thought you could hold it in your hand like any other coin.
@_date: 2019-08-13 21:28:12
Huh? Average salary in the US is about $44k.

Get as far away from it as it can. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:36:04
What was the bottom when it crashed three or four months ago? $5300 or so, right?
@_date: 2018-11-27 06:32:03
You’re delusional. No one wants to buy your bags. 
It’s going to zero. Act accordingly. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 06:34:24
You’re the one trolling. Stop pulling numbers out of your ass. No one wants to use crypto. 
We’ll be sub $1000 for a long time.

I think you bought just a little too early. Good luck!
@_date: 2018-11-25 03:18:53
Not sure why you’re trying to bait me into feeling bad because that’s the way you feel and you want other people to be unhappy, too. That’s your fucking problem, pal. I sleep just fine at night.

Where in Atlanta? I saw a Bitcoin ATM at the Buddy’s convenience store on Highland last week but didn’t see a price. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:09:19
Under $3600 on Coinbase. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 06:39:18
Because they bought too high and don’t want to face the harsh reality that they have zero idea of how markets work and make trades based off emotion instead of logic. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 02:38:48
Bottom is $2788. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 02:00:29
$3200. If that breaks, $1900.

29% down for the week. 
Yeah, sure. Enjoy your p and d.

You’re too early. Wait.

@_date: 2018-11-25 01:56:21
They probably hated selling, but needed the money. That’s honestly the only reason I can see selling right now. In this game, you have to be okay with everything going to zero imo. Any money thrown at crypto should be seen as money spent. 
@_date: 2018-11-03 15:44:36
Hell yeah. I visited Berlin last year and would have loved to have seen this!

I’m okay losing tons of money as long as the memes are dank. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:39:37
Different exchanges have slightly different prices. This is where people arbitrage trade if there’s enough of a price difference to make the fees and potential taxes worth the trade. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 02:46:55
My portfolio is 86% down. Fucking lol.

I was expecting major FUD but that wasn’t too bad. The way he kept it short and kind of mysterious could spark interest from those who had only heard it as a buzzword.

Wasn’t it Lily Allen who turned down a huge payday in Bitcoin years and years ago?
@_date: 2018-11-25 02:34:39
I haven’t bought since $6300 so I consider that a win haha. It will keep going lower. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 12:32:41
Or it will go to nothing. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 00:27:03
So it seems I cannot copy/paste the receiving address on Bovada/Ignition when trying to withdraw winnings in BTC. I’ve had to copy it by hand whenever I make a transaction, with obviously makes me nervous. Any way around this? Thanks!
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:59:54
Me: Oh man it’s so low. This must be the bottom. *buys*. 
Crypto: hold my beer. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 12:36:18
Okay. $400 then. Basically the same thing for almost everyone here who bought too late. Anyone who bought Bitcoin after that price isn’t on this fucking subreddit lmao. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 05:28:52
It’s all going to zero. Sell now while it’s still worth something. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 02:57:51
Eh I’m okay because. 
I invested what I can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 06:01:14
Cool story bro see you at zero. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:09:54
It just hit $5873 on coinbase. Prices tend to dip every night around 4am/5am EST. I see it going to $5500 before sunrise. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 15:40:37
Repost but still funny. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 00:42:17
I’m okay with this one. The last panel is cute.

Great! Everyone starts somewhere. That’s $20 more in Bitcoin than you had yesterday.

I sadly can’t even tell if you’re trolling or not...
@_date: 2018-12-02 01:01:59
Nice. There's also one at Buddy's on N. Highland.

This particular article has been getting passed around lately by the normies. Soo much FUD on my fb feed with people posting it. Idk why it gotten so
much traction. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 20:33:38
You too brutha man. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 23:55:01
Just doesn’t make sense man. It’s like berating the guy who binks the runner runner straight after calling all streets with 72o. Don’t tap the glass.
You sound insufferable.

Sent some BTC to Ignition last night to play some nlhe tournaments and the transfer just now went through. Almost 7 hours later. Ridiculous. It usually takes 1-3 minutes. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 04:38:02
Ehh, I kind of disagree but that’s okay. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 20:41:08
I did, and I now realize I shouldn’t have done that. I’m sure that was the reason. Thanks for your comment. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 04:31:32
We were lower just a few days ago. We broke below $3600. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 17:05:51
Oh boy I can’t wait to store my $1000 worth of BTC. What’s the best wallet to use to store all $856 of it? I can’t wait to see what happens to my $691 of BTC over the next few years. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 19:52:28
A decrease in price. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:29:56
I sold a good bit over the past year and didn’t invest that much to begin with. Keep projecting though, its a good look for you. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 18:42:50
Eh I know but it’s a classic. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:30:51
That’s a good attitude man. We will all get through this one way or another. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 23:42:37
Nice! It takes balls to buy when something is low, and that’s why the average joe loses money. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 23:13:07
I saw a comic a few months ago about a guy in the future who shoots himself in the head because BTC “crashed” to $1M. The price is only relative to when you got in. 
$3900 is fucking heaps if you bought at $50. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 03:21:29
Nice. Where is this? Theres a crypto atm at Buddy’s in Poncey Highlands.

@_date: 2018-12-06 21:42:29
You want mass adoption but laugh at those who bought too high. What kind of sense does that make?
@_date: 2018-12-10 01:02:50
When $2975?
@_date: 2018-12-05 22:58:43
Then why are you here? Did you invest more than you’re willing to lose? Sounds like it. You sound stressed out and bitter. I haven’t bought BTC since $6700 but I certainly don’t think it’s headed for zero. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 23:10:07
Three normies on my Facebook feed have posted this article in the past 24 hours. It’s certainly making the rounds right now.

Is this how you spend the majority of your free time?
@_date: 2018-12-04 23:45:37
So, you want widespread adoption but feel the need to shit on the little guys that are still learning? Lol that’s pretty fucking stupid.
