Put your tattoo money in now and you'll have a ~50% discount on it... just in case.

Are you suggesting 1MB blocks forever then?

There is a record of this request in his picture here: 
I'd assume that the hacker requested the removal of 2FA, and since OP didn't change the password to the account when OP noticed funny business going on, the hacker already knew his password and no longer needed 2 factor authentication to do his dirty work.
EDIT: LESSON! Change your passwords at any hint of trouble (change it from a computer that you know for 110% sure that it is clean.. maybe even a live CD). And always make sure 2FA is enabled.. If it gets disabled, re-enable it the very instant you can.

The cost of a transaction is in *addition* to mining rewards.
When all bitcoins have been mined, the hashing power will dwindle to next to nothing, but the cost of mining today's little mining USB sticks will be low enough that anyone can keep it on to help process transactions for pocket change and next to no electricity.
Edit: 
According to this post, it costs $16/day to process all the transaction that happen as of 1 year ago when it was written.
So the real transaction fee is typically  [0.0001 BTC](

It has full offline functionality using the chrome app.
I understand, and I was very skeptical of using a web browser based IDE as well, but after making the plunge to actually use it, it's been pretty great.. 
Being able to develop from any computer I'm at without having to setup anything or change setting PC to PC is absolutely amazing.
Everything is cross-platform and synced :-)  EDIT: And I don't need to be online to use it.

If people want to find out how easily this will be cracked, then they can add to the bounty if they'd like ;)
I'd start cracking if there was more in there, but I'm not quite interested enough to add to the bounty either.

being wise with exchanges is most definitely very important.

Maybe the yearly "seriously, stay the fuck away" one.
I'm going to start calling the serious ones "the full stop period".

I'll be the first to admit that it's not for everybody...
But you've got nothing to lose to give it a shot!

And I'm suggesting people add their bounty to your wallet you've posted.

That stats page is including the mining rewards as part of the "transaction cost", because 70000 x 0.0001 = 7 btc.
They even say "% earned from transaction fees 0.41%" right there.
Edit: so that cost calculation will drop with time as bitcoin gets more widely accepted and/or all bitcoins get mined.

Also.. I don't want this to feel like an advertisement, but really if there's an IDE I can stand behind... it's this one. 
The development and support behind it is astounding.
Edit: And I asked for bitcoin to be accepted there.
@_date: 2014-04-01 17:43:47
Same here, but someone I know just got spam, and they're not on the list. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 17:18:50
This right here is what people don't understand.  
15 minutes to 12 hours or so to transfer money from paper into a wallet, and into an exchange may be too late to make the profit you see coming, or even waiting for a (possibly momentary) price strike.  
**This** right here is what has let me double what coins I've mined.
@_date: 2014-03-26 23:53:04
Lack of a what?
@_date: 2014-02-07 19:38:27
Holding onto a few hundred dollars worth of an altcoin (that I've mined) is nothing to keep in an exchange.  I'm sure as heck glad I used that method on doge when I started mining it.
@_date: 2014-03-05 01:09:01
This is true.
I guess a wallet would have to be made that no one knows the password to (randomly generated or something).
@_date: 2014-03-27 00:45:57
Sounds like some sort of variation on a feminine issue.
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:09:31
Yes... or did 2FA just magically disappear?
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:54:59
? Site isn't down for me.. It's actually performing quite well.
Edit: And what service/protocol you hook up is optional :-)
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:13:07
The hacker could have changed your email address associated with your btce account, leaving you with no withdrawal notices on march 1st/2nd.
Did you have 2 factor enabled on your account? (Yes I see that it was enabled during your problems, but just checking if you had enabled it prior to your issues)
If 2fa was enabled prior to the issues, then I'd want to hear about it... That might be serious. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:32:42
Upload them to  and post the link.

Which is why scams work with any currency.
This is why people shouldn't be doing business without making sure that what they are throwing their money at is trustworthy.
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:23:13
I see... so in the process of unlocking your account, they also disabled 2FA.
EDIT: also.. Was 2FA enabled through an app on your phone, or just email?
Once your account was unlocked did you change your password or just leave it the same?
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:29:53
I can't say enough about how awesome this IDE is, and the development/support behind it.
Best yet? Just added an option to pay for premium features using bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-05-17 14:58:15
If not, this has a pretty good chance of being a failure.
@_date: 2014-04-16 00:51:49
With bitcoin you are your own bank, and if you're not comfortable with that, that's fine, because it's your choice.
@_date: 2017-09-29 03:40:40
That sort of behavior is not abnormal drama in the development world. Right now there are other projects that have plenty of heated debates, SJWs, etc. namely nodejs and the CEO of NPM.
Bitcoin just happens to have a lot of spectators, non-dev community, and money on the line, so there are a lot more people chiming in and taking sides. 
Everyone has a right to take a side, even if they aren't a programmer, but many make misguided decisions because someone explained their side convincingly or maybe even incorrectly.
I don't want to get into it too much, but a lot of the "facts" on scalability of both sides are based on speculation.

Total sidenote... It's truly unfortunate that most of the awesome consumer protections got done away with this month. I really liked the built-in extended warranties on everything I bought.

I forward emails like these every once in a while to you. You always do a great job of handling the situation. 
Edit: also, mailchimp does not approve of emails like this.. They will ban them if this is brought to their attention.  
Mailchimp is awesome.
@_date: 2017-06-05 04:38:10
Me neither, until I was locked out of my account. Took weeks for them answer my email, then weeks until they solved the technical issue with 2FA on their end.
@_date: 2017-06-05 20:05:32
I'll PM you.
