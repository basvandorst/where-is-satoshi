Sounds very primitive when you explain it like that but I totally agree, its definitely going to take some time for our culture to adjust to such a radical shift though. I don't think this will be as easy as moving from DVDS to online media but I have heard this type of comparison made before.

Thanks mate, appreciate it. Sometimes its hard for someone my age to have stimulating conversations about topics like this so communicating with like minded folks online helps reassure that I'm thinking in the right direction.

Never once did I say either one of these guys where my heros, just stated that I thought they where reasonably intelligent people.

Interesting, and I'm assuming one or more of these markets will be adopted by bitcoin in the near future so this is almost an inevitability. That is unless another digital currency takes its place, though I have heard Andrea Antonopoulos mention that multiple different cryptocurrency's will infiltrate different markets such as Darkcoin for anonymous transactions witch would be attractive to drug dealers for example. So would you think it would be a good idea to invest in multiple different currency's or are you coming from the train of thought that these other currency's are only in there adolescent stages and wont mature enough for any of them to fully take off and get mainstream adoption like Bitcoin has?
