@_date: 2017-02-24 08:55:08
What the actual fuck
@_date: 2017-02-26 20:27:04
Just buy and hodl.
Doing faucets is just a waste of time.
@_date: 2017-02-23 18:17:22
@_date: 2017-02-24 09:47:24
It's back up.
@_date: 2017-02-25 19:14:33
You can also install the bitcoin ticker app from the appstore for free, I think it has the same result
@_date: 2017-02-28 15:53:46
I had the same problem so I used the accelerator and it actually worked
@_date: 2017-03-01 13:20:29
Nobody knows
@_date: 2017-03-02 12:15:11
@_date: 2017-03-02 23:08:06
Holy shit that's a good song! 
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:43:19
only dropped 50$?
@_date: 2017-08-01 08:16:40
Valar hodlhaeris.
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:02:03
The fork hasn’t even happened yet.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:29:38
What does it matter if you dislike a coin? I it makes you money it doesn’t matter right?
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:13:50
I think it’s both 1 &amp; 2
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:30:12
The Netherlands
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:40:07
I always buy at Litebit, no problems so far.
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:05:44
It was a bug.
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:51:01
Damn I would be scared if I was responsible with such an big amount.
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:20:20
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:10:20
Why? It’s always a wise investment. Buy and buy more when it drops.
@_date: 2017-10-19 04:39:23
I think you’ve made a wrong choice since bitcoin already had a pullbback yesterday.
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:58:40
Welcome! Enjoy the rollercoaster.
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:39:02
Imho it’s better to wait for the bitcoin gold fork to happen since a lot of people will be selling bitcoin to go back in the cheap altcoins. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 19:00:33
It’s just a bug, refresh the page and it’s gone.
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:16:35
Why you buy bitcoin xbt when you can buy the real bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:50:19
Fuck off.
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:21:44
Haha exactly.
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:44:35
Lol, what is this?
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:45:26
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:07:08
Welcome on board! Enjoy the ride and dont panic sell when it drops a few hundred dollars.
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:16:17
Thousands of accounts? They said 0.01% of all accounts on bittrex.
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:39:34
You can just change the fee.
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:20:54
You probably wrote it down wrong, if it says its invalid, it’s invalid.
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:21:20
Bittrex and binance support BTG, I think you have still time to move them there.
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:42:47
I think october 26 would be a good time to buy but thats just what i would do. So please don’t take it as my financial advise.
@_date: 2017-10-17 21:41:08
You need to clean your screen, lol.
@_date: 2017-10-19 06:30:23
No one knows.
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:06:18
And this month is not even over yet.
@_date: 2017-10-15 20:40:08
It’s not. I read it somewhere in a Dutch newspaper.
@_date: 2017-10-18 11:41:49
They're making the right choice. It will pay off big.
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:49:46
Still so many sceptics, they will be sorry that they didn’t buy now lol
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:23:10
This will always happen. There are new people entering the market and when they see the price drop, they panic sell.
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:51:45
Just get a normal job and buy bitcoin with the money you earn.
@_date: 2017-10-17 18:59:13
What’s the point? It’s just the normal ruble but just in cryptocurrency form.
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:17:13
Yeah right.. 2000 ��
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:04:43
Congrats. I wish I knew about bitcoin back then.
@_date: 2017-10-29 09:33:42
Hahaha damn.
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:27:40
The /s means he's being sarcastic..
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:59:28
BFG?
