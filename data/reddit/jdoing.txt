Keep in mind some of the people that invested less than 1K invested it back in 2012 :)
Good advise on the paper wallet, it gives you a bit more time to think about what you are doing before you panic sell, especially if you keep your key somewhere difficult to get to like a safety deposit box.

Most likely businesses will start up that will provide the hardware and software to other businesses for processing lightning payments and will also act as a hub for normal users to attract more users they will probably offer to cover fees or possibily even pay people for joining up and using their network.

He said they would never be spent, hopefully they keys were destroyed just to make sure.  I'm not sure what would happen if Satoshi Nakamoto dies 4 or 5 years from now and someone finds private keys worth 1,000,000 BTC if bitcoin was worth about 500,000 usd they would have half of a trillion dollars in USD but if they touched any of the keys thought to belong to him/her/them there could be a massive sell off if everyone thought the market was going to be flooded with so many coins.

Peer to peer on chain transactions will be useful for busines to busines transactions that are substantial or for large purchases like homes or automobiles that may currently be covered with a money order or payed in cash.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:50:38
Hubs will open up that will function like a bitcoin lightning bank to attract users they could offer to cover fees for opening or closing channels.  This would be funded by merchants through the hubs, the merchants are used to paying up to 3% on purchases with lightning this could be much lower thus attracting merchants to use the service.

You should expect this as long as the value of bitcoin is more than the energy cost to produce it plus the associated overhead for equipment and cooling.

Bitcoin CO2 emissions is a function of the value of bitcoin and the cost of electricity; block size has little or no effect on these variables.

Make sure you buy it directly from trezor DO NOT use eBay or some third party auction site. After you set it up move a small amount to it that you would be comfortable with losing then re initialize it and restore using your seed phrase you created when you set it up.  If the coins are there congratulations you can be confident that if something happens to your trezor you would be able to retrieve your funds.
If there is a seed phrase already included with your device that is a scam do not use it! I would also throw out the trezor because you can't be sure if it has been tampered with.

Bitcoin in its final form will be complex, but this is ok most people don't understand the osi model but that doesn't prevent them from using computer networks.  The devs are learning from past mistakes and building the base layer as robust as possible if the developers of the internet had this approach we would have a much better internet than we do today.

There is no doubt in my mind that lightning will gravitate toward a hub and spoke model that would look eerily similar to our current banking system. However, you would still have the ability to operate outside of the hubs if you wish, with modern banking you can't setup a funded checking account between yourself and say the grocery store you frequent or your mechanic.  Some people like regulation and will seek it out, but this system will still allow you to operate outside of the government approved system if you wish.

If it follows the same track we are going to see $4,000 bitcoin before it gradually rises then explodes to $300,000 and "crashes" back to about $150,000.
I held my bitcoin in 2013 and I will hold it today.  Its going to be real interesting to see what happens after the next halving and with second layer solutions.  This is an exciting time to be involved with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-11 01:23:58
You could make an on chain transaction to a hub node that could send the funds to you on lightning.  This would be a very low fee transaction.  But I don't think that will even matter because I feel like we will have hubs open up that are funded by merchants this would allow hubs to cover the cost of opening a channel or topping it off.  The hubs would offer this because the more nodes connected to them will lower their cost to provide the service to the merchants.

This is normal for BTC and why we have HODL mems
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:56:40
stick in there, dollar cost average or wait for a dip and buy what you can.  Maybe you will get lucky like me and your bitcoin will come back to you. I was fortunate that I didn't lose much and I could replace it. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:43:01
I'm a little concerned that this may be too complicated for your average user.  In essence, assuming mass adoption, this would work somewhat like a normal bank account. Most peoples funds would always reside in the lightning level savings would not, so having btc outside of lighting would be like having $$ in savings and anything tied up in the lightning network would be your checking account.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:45:14
I think ideally you would open up a channel with an intermediary you trust.  There could be hundreds of these and they would all be connected together.  If there was a bad actor you wouldn't be connected directly, the intermediary would handle terminating the channel this would be considered part of the overhead for running a lightning node as a business.

I think the reason for this is because they want to know if you are well off, rich, very rich, or about to exceed Bill Gates in net worth.  Sometimes its best to just tell them the truth, that you foolishly spent most of it on gambling sites and lost the rest when Mt. Gox went down and you were so jaded that you never invested after that.

Your about 4 years to late for bitcoin gpu mining.  You can do it indirectly using nicehash a gtx 1080ti should net you about .0004 BTC per day 
Check out a gpumining sub you will be able to find more help there
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:39:00
You can cash out some of your BTC and still be a believer, you just do it so you can pay for something you want/need.  Say for example you invested $5,000 back in 2013 when it was at $250 and have HODLED all of these years because you know it would one day replace fiat 
Also assume you have about $100,000 in debt it would be prudent to use your BTC to pay off your debt at this point because it would only put a small dent in your BTC holdings.  For a lot of things cashing out into fiat is the only way to spend your BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:09:11

@_date: 2017-12-15 20:29:47
Sure buy another Trezor, another option would be to transfer everything out to an electrum wallet or some other wallet like blockchain.info, leave only a few hundred satoshis and then do the restore.

@_date: 2017-12-26 17:11:03
Yes, I think of the lightning network as like your checking account and on-chain like your savings account.  We could create commercial hubs/nodes that you would open up a channel with and pay a tiny fee for transactions.  The node would be connected to other nodes, when you pay the coffee shop with lightning you may be going through a few different nodes.

This is bull shit, the guy hasn't even been convicted! How would you like it if the government stole your coin and sold it when it was worth 20,000 and it takes a few years for you to get your name cleared and in the meantime, the value has increased 10X.
On another note, this guy is an idiot and if he was doing something illegal (which I do not condone) what kind of fool keeps his bitcoin in a manner that would allow it to be confiscated. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:23:33
Coinbase is the way to go, just use a credit card and you will have your BTC in minutes. you will also get 10 USD free if you ever want to move it off the exchange look into transferring it to gdax (this is an exchange owned by the same company) then you can send it to a different wallet with no fees.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:55:08
Bcash is an offshoot created by a few guys that had very large incentive to not allow the segwit update (basically segwit fixed a bug that was making them money) it may have faster transactions but that is because they made changes that are reckless and possibly could compromise the security of the bitcoin network in the long run.

I lost about 30 LTC and about .5 BTC on full node wallets I had, the PC crashed and for some reason my passphrase wouldn't work.  The first thing I did as soon as I found out that I had lost the coins is stop my losses by buying the exact amount that I had lost.  This way I would never look back and say I could of had 15, 50, or 100K if I hadn't lost the wallet.
I think the total value at the time I found out was like 2K (when I created the wallets it wasn't worth $100). Yesterday when I heard LTC had shot up I started trying my passphrase again and somehow it came to me so I ended up doubling my money lol

@_date: 2017-12-15 15:26:03
If you haven't already transferred your coins it would be prudent for you to practice recovering your wallet using your seed phrase.  This will ensure that you wrote it down correctly and give you peace of mind in knowing that as long as you have that phrase you will not lose your coins.

That's what they say but, if you really get what bitcoin is about you will want to keep the coins on your own wallet.  Never forget "Your keys, your bitcoin. Not your keys, not your bitcoin"
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:34:43
It really depends on how much you bought and how much that is to you and what exchange you used. Coinbase is generally considered the safest in the US, they claim to be insured both by FDIC for dollar deposits and by other insurers for bitcoin holdings, but who knows that could be a lie and it may take months or years to get your bitcoin back in the event of a hack.
Most people recommend a hardware wallet like Ledger and Trezor, this would probably be the easiest and safest thing for noobs and if you are paranoid about using a hardware wallet you can create a paper wallet but you will need to find a good guide and be somewhat competent with computers to do it right.
For me as a rule of thumb, if its less than say 5% of what I keep in my checking account I just leave it on the exchange and once I bought enough to cross that threshold I move it to a hardware wallet.  When I have a substantial amount on the hardware wallet then I move it to cold storage.

It would take more disk space and processing power to store and verify the blockchain and it would take longer to download the new transactions. This isn't much of an issue today because the blockchain is relatively small but if you scale up just a few orders of magnitude most people couldn't afford a full node which would lead to only rich people or large organizations being able to run a full node thus fewer nodes --&gt; centralization. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:51:32

If bitcoin is truly successful most users will have no idea what a Blockchain is or understand cryptography they will just know they can point their phone at one of those qr code things and their phone will send someone money. There will be no understanding of transaction fees or verifications it will just work.  What percentage of the population understands how the internet works on even the most basic level.  Once we get to the same percentage with bitcoin users, we will be fully adopted.

yes!  we need to keep the bitcoin name as the commonly traded unit, we would effectively be increasingly the supply of bitcoin 1,000 times so bitcoin would be trading at $3 today.  Once we get our scaling issues worked out the developers could move on to something like this fairly easily.
@_date: 2017-06-21 12:54:23
I think the best move would be to increase the amount of bitcoin 1000 fold.  If you have 10 bitcoin in your wallet it would be changed to 10,000 this could be done with a code change and we can all continue to use the word bitcoin.  
There is no clear solution that involves people using some other term, this just causes confusion.  This solution could be done repeatedly as the market value of all bitcoins increases i.e. when bitcoin gets to around 1-3 K we increase the supply to make it around a few dollars again.  I think this would be a faster way to get to $100,000 or $1,000,000 bitcoins, there is a huge psychological barrier once it gets past a certain point.
