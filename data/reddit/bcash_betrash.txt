You can put gold into a reserve without knowing precisely how it is mined.  These guys annoy me with this pretentious, and rather elitist, idea that you must fully understand Bitcoin to invest in it.  People have expertise in other areas.
I would use the links on this page to the right and simply find out:
1.  How to buy it.
2. How to store it (to a **reasonable** degree of security - some people get completely obsessed ..)
3. How to make a transaction.
3. (And do make sure you back up your 'seed words' somewhere - maybe two places.  They are essentially a code that represents your entire stash.)
That's it.
Some posters are rude; have completely lost sight, and are simply unpleasant.

I had a great time at our 4th of July celebrations yesterday.  New Nursey and Brie Larson performed brilliantly during their topless mud wrestling display.  Then I took the Helldiver up and did a solo fly-past.  Eventually my bone spurs became too painful, and I had to sit down to watch the new sleuth of polar bears chase guests around the lawn.

Keep up to date Bitcoiner: the estate leopard took down Scottie 'Enterprise' Scot, my aircraft engineer, (RIP), and the beast was despatched by a SWAT team.  Now replaced by a Siberian tiger pack.  I have instructed Nursey to regularly throw joints of meat to them; to gain their trust, and avoid a similar fate.
@_date: 2019-07-03 14:50:15
She certainly does rock.  I've kept her on to help Cook, and maybe do a little tidying up around the place.  She's also a good defence against burglars (once she gets her costume and make-up on.)  It is win-win.

Everyone is a noob, my fine Bitcoining friend.  You should see Brie trying to polish the Helldiver undercarriage: useless.  Nursey doesn't approve of her - there may be some jealousy playing itself out there.  Who cares?

I'm puzzled.
Do you mean the maximum or minimum value by 'peak'? - is this some weird financial term?
And to be parabolic is must be quadratic - I doubt any of these curves are.
If the 'peak' (i.e. non-local maximum) is at x = 0, are you thinking of a parabola of the form -y = f(x^2, x)?  (note the negative sign.)
Crikey.  This has caused so much confusion amongst the quiet and rather gentle but brilliant staff running my underground supercomputer, that it has upset everyone.  I even found someone sitting on the stairs in tears*.

I promise to never, ever, say again that women are irrational, and then make some pathetic comparison with Bitcoin.
I have been thoroughly told off, and am now completely woke.
I have purchased Ghostbusters 2016 and have attempted to watch it; upvoted a Batwoman teaser; gone vegan; shot my Siberian tigers (on the basis they are carnivores and fart methane); sacked new Nursey (on the basis her employment was sexist, and purely due to her being pretty); discarded my fine leather footwear and bought plastic ones - which, due to my estate-wide plastic ban, I have had recycled and turned into an, er, another thing made of plastic.
I sincerely apologise for not being politically correct enough.

I can make an insecure transaction anonymously (e.g. post you some cash in a bag by mail without telling anyone, and then hope you reciprocate with goods in return.  Assuming my cash is delivered.)
I can also make a secure transaction without being fully anonymous; by allowing the transaction to exist on the blockchain.
Therefore they cannot be the same thing.

Bcash has caused so much confusion that it may need to fully collapse (it's getting there) for Bitcoin to recover completely.
Even the other day, there was a post on Reddit with someone asking what the relationship was between Bcash and Bitcoin - as if it were some sort of sister coin.  Well of course it is not - Bcash is a hostile, centralised, project attempting to pass-off.
I blame Ver for this deliberate and calculated confusion.

One of Roger Ver's tactics over the past year, as part of his desperate and nasty mission to undermine Bitcoin, has been to repeatedly foretell an ETH flippening of Bitcoin (followed by a Bcash takeover - ho ho!)
Well, that prediction is going as much to plan as his embattled and dying Btrash coin.

The 'live in a concrete bunker surrounded by guns, water, and stocks of beans' crowd worry about this.
It isn't a big worry IMO, unless you hold a large quantity.
I kept a 5 figure sum on an exchange for months, and all was fine.  But it has now been moved somewhere safer.
Also, if you control the keys (i.e. they are in your personal wallet, not theirs), you get any airdrops due to you.  If you leave coins on an exchange then it is up to them when to release them to you - if ever.

I have no doubt people will try it.  I also suspect Roger's cabal will pump that false opportunity for all it is worth.
So there may be a short term Bcash price rise, even though rationally it should be a collapse.  It will be interesting to watch.

@_date: 2018-09-08 23:01:02
Here's the logic:
Bitcoin underpins crypto for good reason: technologically, politically, economically and in terms of trust and decentralisation.  If Bitcoin fails, crypto fails.
So there is no point pissing around investing in other cryptocurrencies (unless you are a very smart day trader - and most lose vast amounts in the medium term.)
Bitcoin (and *one other* altcoin IMO) are worth investing in.
Both are mineable, and heavily decentralised.

Price also follows trust.  
Bcash has made no effort to gain any trust or respect.  
There won't be another coin deceiving the public claiming to be BTC again.  That's one good thing that's emerged from Bcash's abject failure.

The reason is: can you remember your street address from 5 years ago, that you used every day?  Including the zip code and phone number?
If you go down the memory route, you will need to practise that recovery routine every couple of weeks.
It is IMO FAR riskier than having it written down somewhere.
You can also tell your inheritor what the hint refers to - so they can complete it when they find your seed should you die.
Try to keep it simple.
I also use a couple of military security USBs.  You can set them to display the same password hint on boot up.  Guess it wrong 6 times and they self wipe.  20 USD or less from Amazon.
You will never get it totally secure, but to steal my funds you would need to be seriously committed, and it is really quite simple security.
I'll post more if you wish.

Absolutely right to be bullish.  
In the background there is a huge amount of interest building in BTC.  
I can't understand why folks seem a little disheartened on a day to day basis.
And what makes it even better is that Bcash are not even in the running regarding these interests - they are completely out of the picture - as a distrusted, funny altcoin run by conspiracy theorists and controlled by comedic individuals and chancers.

All I can add is that it is surprisingly difficult to judge levels of atheism based upon commonsense.
For example, it would be tempting to think that atheism would be strong among the 'hard' sciences, such as mathematics and physics.
But evidence suggests this isn't correct: atheism appears more common among biological sciences than among physicists and mathematicians.
It may be that the latter have a stronger philosophical feeling about the order of things.

Is this relevant to Bitcoin?  I say yes, immensely.  We've been held back by their market confusion. 
Did you know that if you download Ver's Bitcoin(dot)com wallet, you can only find the BTC wallet features under advanced settings?  Just how many innocent newcomers has this confused?  I daren't even go into the advanced setting of my X M R wallet, and I'm not a crypto beginner.

That is not the consensus of traders.  
They are split down the middle regarding price move up or down.
However, those that believe that the possibility of ETF failure is already priced in, predict little change.
So we're left with higher possibilities of either UP, or little change.
Your troll analysis of dump is far from the general opinion.
Hey, Everyman, it might go down, it might not - but quit with your repeated 'certainty' of failure - it is essentially a constant troll.

3.  Anyone can predict a price change, it can really only go up or down.  So there is no particular prescience or insight in a guess that it will decline.  I too expected some decline.  So what have you got to offer?

You haven't defined ecosystem - that's a word borrowed from biology.
Information is required to run complex societies.
Who owns their financial wealth? - for generations people have had to borrow to have, for example, mortgages.
Debt isn't necessarily a bad thing - even government debt.  It passes on some of the capital investment of the present to the future beneficiaries of the infrastructure.
Peace of mind, not piece of mind.
I think it is too early to politicize BTC in this way.

Ah.. I just understood Faketoshi and Ayres Bcash fork idea.
(Sorry for being slow)
They want to split Bcash and make a fork (Bcash cash?) which they will call - wait for it - Bitcoin SV!
(oh..good name)
SV stands for Satoshi's Vision!
So, it turns out that Bcash is NOT Satoshi's vision after all (uh?)  
They are going to have a contentious hard-fork to create the true one.
The other one (Ver's) would then be called, er, Bcash?  Or Bcash NSV (not Satoshi's vision?)

**Roger Ver: Sausages vs Bcash trading offer update:**
Apparently Roger Ver Skyped my mansion last night to get in touch regarding trading sausages for his worthless and dishonest Bcash alt-coin.  
Unfortunately McDoogle, our pot washer, was the only one manning our house supercomputer in our cooled basement.
Although our supercomputer is state of the art, with a few parallel experimental qubits, its 23rd century operating system is now incompatible with Skype and McDoogle was unable to take his call.
Apologies Roger.  I know (snigger) you are an honest man.  
I will raise my offer: 5 sausages for one of your lying Bcash shitcoins.
(Do bear in mind that when failing Bitmain sell off their bags of your fake Bitcoin, we may be looking at 1000 Bcash per sausage.  At which point we may need to switch to vegetables.) 
Got to go.  Nurse is pulling me away from the com[put .....
@_date: 2019-03-23 11:38:08
@_date: 2019-03-29 22:03:44

Gday Bitcoiners!
My ban is over.  'Twas a fair cop - I was being a f*ckwit.  
(So much for Ver's teary blubbing conspiracy theories - real Bitcoiners get banned too.)
p.s.  Bcash is still at around 4%.  Just how long does it take for a dishonest project to die?  Almost dead tho.  Just watch Bitmain sell all those Rogercoin bags ..
^(Edit: 'twas, not t'was - doh!)

No probs.
Bear in mind that the lying Bcash project has been bagged to  hundreds of millions of dollars by Bitmain.  It is a failed project for the simple reason that it is fundamentally dishonest.  
People and markets don't admire dishonesty.
And neither do I.
When Bitmain, which is objectively struggling financially, sells those bags, Bcash's value will fall to close to zero.
Did you hear that Roger?

Bcash under 0.08 again.  The barely 'heady' days of 0.1 are over for that dying scam coin.  But it's like one of those zombies in a movie that keep getting hit on the head with a spade.  Dying, but being rather slow about it. 
@_date: 2018-10-14 07:00:36
I see what you tried and failed to do there.

Just put it online, provide a link and stop fucking around.  People have printers these days :)
Or - 
Stick it in a frame, charge 100 USD and Bcashers will buy it - head over there.  
Don't forget to produce multiple versions for their upcoming hard-forks, because those lying fuckers can't even get on amongst themselves.

Nothing wrong with Windows.  It is perfectly secure for most people.
But why is your wallet info stored there?
p.s.  for the ultra secure boys, here's my advice:
Don't use linux, write your own operating system.
Install it only once on any one laptop.
After making a transaction destroy your laptop and buy another.  
Douse it in gasoline, set fire to it, then smash it up so the Feds can't reassemble it.
Also - never go online.

Nursey brought me my dinner earlier: sausages and turnips. (I suspect she pockets the difference between what cook is supposed to prepare for me, and what I get.  Friday is usually rare animal night, and a few thousand dollars for a leopard rib used to be the general rule round here.)
Anyway.  I will get to the point.
I have a spare sausage.  It is now a bit cold and dribbly.  If Mr Ver is reading, I was wondering if he would like to trade it for one of his Bcash shitcoins?  I have always wanted a lying shitcoin in my portfolio, and I have a spare sausage.
In short, I offer 1 uneaten sausage for 1 Bcash.  Please advise exchange Roger.
Cheerio true Bitcoiners! (and Roger.)

The price is limitless - but ONLY for Bitcoin.
Scam coins and shitcoins only have the attribute of being in existence - that is simply not enough, and is not a gold standard.
Ver thinks he can obfuscate to create a coin - that immediately makes it worthless in the long term.  Bcash is worthless.
There has to be authority, and genuine credibility.

@_date: 2019-08-04 10:55:41
Here's a more serious bit of advice: I don't think even financial experts know how to day-trade Bitcoin.  It is effectively a coin toss.  It is a really risky thing to get into.
A few years back I read about Bitcoin, and I bought some.  I didn't even check the price - I might have bought at the wrong time of day - I just thought I would get a few.  So I bought them, and I held them.
I could have made a fortune if I had bought and sold at the right times - but all of that is, of course, in retrospect!
Be a lazy bastard.  Get some Bitcoin.  Leave it at that.

Shor's algorithm is purely theoretical, and Bitcoin is not.  Bitcoin is a functioning technology.
Shor's analysis completely disregards quantum decoherence - a severe technical problem -  and consequently there is a poor number of available qubits.  (These little particles refuse to maintain their spin states :)
Maybe Bitcoin will be cracked one day, but I doubt it.  Certainly not within the next few decades, and by that time it will have evolved.

p.s.  Ruby is launching BatWomanCoin (BWC)  
It is a fork of RogerCoin (B C H ABC)
So it will be B C H ABC BWC.
It has a 16 yottabyte block size.
It is the ultimate shitcoin.  There are no computers capable of running it - so it is the future.
In 2030 you will be able to buy a coffee with it in a back street of Tokyo.

Top tip 
Every time you make a Bitcoin transaction, smash up your computer with a sledgehammer..  Pour a gallon of gas over it, and set it on fire.  Put the pieces through a wood chipper.  Then tow the wood chipper to the edge of a cliff and throw it over the edge.  If possible, set fire to the woodchipper, and torch the entire area.  Go home, and set fire to the sledgehammer.

Good to see lying Bcash: the most dishonest altcoin in history, now squatting in 5th place by market cap.
My under-assistant librarian, Ms Batwoman, who has short hair and a degree in economics from drama school, tells me that this Bcash failure is inevitable, because any currency tainted by dishonesty is doomed to fail due to lack of trust.
I don't often listen to ladies.  But who knows - she might be right!

There's very little that can be done about it.  Bitcoin isn't owned by anyone - so there are no trademarks or intellectual properties to protect in courts of law.
Bcash, thankfully, is failing, through (justified) perceptions of dishonesty.  it is now 5th by market cap.
RogerCoiners may have their points - but hijacking the Bitcoin name has, in my opinion, done huge damage to the emergent cryptoworld by causing so much confusion.
I would add that, to my knowledge (and he is welcome to write here to contradict me) Roger Ver hasn't sold a single 'real' Bitcoin, and by that I mean Bitcoin.  He owns many. 
He is no fool.  
But he has persuaded an awful lot of people to buy his Bcash, on Bitcoin.com.
I can also add, without any fear of a libel case, because it is true, that he is a convicted criminal who has served time in an American prison.

But also to call into question the legitimacy of pass-off coins produced by gentlemen like Mr Ver and that Australian Mr Faketoshi.  And the gentleman with the strange haircut, Calvin?  - although that could be any of them.

The MtGox coins are tinted slightly purple - a counter money-laundering measure carried out secretly by the FBI - so they should be easy to identify.

Bcash is a failing project that imitates Bitcoin, whilst constantly attacking it over fees.  Bcash has low fees because no-one uses it.  And even its volumes are faked - with multiple tiny transactions botted to make it appear it is being widely used.
Sometimes Bitcoin can be a victim of its own success - with this many transactions, and billions transacted, the network is bound to slow down a little.
I think that, at some point, Bitcoin will increase the blocksize - but unlike our unscrupulous competitors, this would be done sensibly and cautiously.  Because with an increased blocksize there are risks surrounding security, democracy and centralisation.  Concepts that the dishonest don't care about.

Really difficult to mine major coins now - operations are conducted by big companies where electricity is cheap and temperatures are cool.
It's actually quite hard to mine and earn more than your electricity is costing in most parts of the world.
As a project, you could think about mining coins designed for 'home' mining. I'm thinking Monero - but that info might be out of date.
If you live somewhere where it gets very cold in winter, your mining hardware effectively becomes a heater (the only tiny energy loss is the contribution to the increased entropy of the code I guess.)
So I might get myself a 'heater' over the winter - i.e. a mining rig, as it will keep the room warm, and maybe output some crypto.  But it would only be a few dollars.  Good luck :)

Such comments are a little meaningless without some sense of scale.  
The Dow operates around the 27,000 mark.  
So you're writing that the Dow is up 2/27ths.  
Because I can't calculate percentages, I asked Ms Rucker 'Princess' McFocker, in my accounts department (pretty lady), to calculate this for me.
She tells me that 2/27 is mathematically identical to 1/13.5 and is about 7.4 %.
Bitcoin is up around 37% over the month.
I was also chatting to Scottie 'Enterprise' Scot, my aircraft engineer, (not very pretty) a few moments ago, as we affectionately kicked the tyres of my Curtiss SB2C Helldiver WW2 US Navy dive bomber together*, and he has assured me that 37 is a considerably larger number than 7.4.

IMO, as a Bitcoin holder, future price valuation is somewhere between  100 dollars and 500,000 dollars.
That's a big range :)
If anyone knew for sure, everyone would be rich - which of course is not feasible.
As an investment holder myself, across a range of commodities, I think anyone with a modicum of sense, and some spare funds, should put at least 5% into BTC.

According to Grinwell, rather than being sanguine about FaceCoin, RogerCoiners are in paroxysms of anger, worry and panic about it.
Because it is essentially another RogerCoin, and no doubt faster (like many other altcoins that are already in existence), and it undermines their dishonest and similarly centralised project and makes it even more pointless.

Only three categories of cryptocurrencies:
Altcoins / Shitcoins:
If shLitecoin and other fast coins take off, which they will - it is inevitable - then there will be a massive increase in crypto payment volumes and convenience.
The Ultra Shitcoin:
Nearly fast, but not / centralised / scam coin Bcash.  Relies upon 0-conf workarounds: not trusted (for good reason) no future.  no purpose.  No trust.
Genuine Crypto:
Bitcoin.  TRUSTED.  DECENTRALISED.  DEMOCRATIC.  And Lightning is an amazing technology.  At one time admired by discredited shitcoiner Roger Ver.  But I (personally) see Bitcoin more as the gold standard, and the foundation upon which the financial revolution sits.

It is the mods absolute right to do that.

Instead Rog ran away in a big display of tears, and set up a rival coin that not only attempted to steal the universally regarded and recognised Bitcoin logo, and name, but also shilled that shitcoin on a site called Bitcoin.com.

This rather weighty WW2 US Navy Dive Bomber has proved unpopular with my staff, and to be honest, everyone in the vicinity. 
Its Wright R-2600-20 Cyclone 1900 horse power engine is rather noisy, and the machine tears up my lawns big time during take-off, which has caused a long-running and rather bitter dispute between my Assistant-Head Gardener [lawns], Kurt 'C*nt' Curtis and my aircraft technician,  Mr Scottie 'Enterprise' Scot.   
Destruction of the nearby small town will hopefully resolve this, and finally enable construction of a few miles of decent tarmac for a more leisurely takeoff.  Needless to say, this is rather unpopular with the town folk.)

That is impossible to say, and if anyone knew the answer, they would be in a very fine position.
I see no logical argument against an ATH of 100,000 USD.  
But others have predicted higher, based on gold volumes, prices and gold equivalency.
A simple exercise is to take the value of all of the gold stocks in the world, and divide by 21 million.  A rather large number emerges.
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:43:03
It could well be 50k in a shorter time period.
All currencies are ultimately based upon trust - if the trust isn't there, there is no coin of any value.
Next to Bitcoin there is only one other coin with similar levels of trust, and it is a surprising one.
It is certainly not RogerCoin/Bcash/FaketoshiCoin - the least trustworthy and most damaging of all cryptocoins.
@_date: 2019-06-22 08:16:24
Bitcoin.com is owned by Roger Ver - he is, in my opinion (and many others') dishonestly pushing Bitcoin Cash (Bcash) over Bitcoin.  
They are completely different coins.
The correct ticker for Bitcoin is BTC.
You sell Bitcoin on exchanges.  You would need to sign up to one.  I wouldn't trade if you're not sure - just hold.

All they are doing is - in the long term - pushing the price up.
@_date: 2019-06-25 07:08:42
Lets put it this way.  Every time I make a bitcoin transaction, I do it from a concrete bunker lined with lead using an off the shelf computer bought at a random store by my under-chief of security, Jack 'Jackie' Chan.  We then install a  bespoke operating system: an ultra secure version of Linux developed by Ruby 'Batlady' Rose.  After the transaction I pour a gallon of gas over the computer, set fire to it, and smash it up with a sledgehammer.  Then I set fire to the sledgehammer, put the computer parts through a wood chipper and blow up the bunker.
Although this is a little expensive and time consuming, it is better to be safe than sorry.

**Thank you!**  
It is high time us hodlers had some appreciation for our valuable work.
It is extremely hard conducting our hodling.  
We sit here at our computers, occasionally standing up, but mainly sitting down, with a bit of price checking and then some wandering about.  Saying good morning occasionally to people - like our wives for example.
Then a bit more pondering.  Maybe a walk outside to get some air, perhaps an ice cream from that stand over the road.  Maybe we will go and buy some socks, or other small undergarments.  Look! There's an animal in a tree!
This is how we struggle with our hodling.  It is an active activity. 
Our Trezors get dusty; we wake up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat because we can't quite remember our passphrase - because it has been so long ...  In fact, I'm not sure where my Trezor is ..
Oh yes.  Hodling is hard.  Hard, hard work.  Exhausting and challenging, like a polar icecap mission.
But it is virtuous.  
So to all you hodlers out there.  Take it easy.  Have a break from hodling.  Be nice to yourself.  Maybe go to a spa and have a makeover.
Disclaimer: I am a Bitcoin hodler.

Wright is a fraud and a liar, and a long time associate of Roger Ver, who is a convicted criminal.
I have reviewed some of Wright's 'maths' papers, and they are full of errors, copying and absurd references - in one case to the meaning of the kronecker delta.  This doesn't need referencing Wright, you fraud, any mathematician knows its meaning.  In your case, you referenced to a high school math book.
Wright, you are a fraud and a liar.  
You and Ver are as bad as each other.

We may not be at the bottom.  I'm willing to accept that.  But let's see.
People who claim they can continuously short Bitcoin and make money predicting its short term movements are liars and losers.  They are like the gambler who threw 3 sixes and think that will sustain.  But it doesn't.
That's why they are here: somehow trying to move the price to recover their foolish losses and help themselves.
It is impossible to predict Bitcoin movement short term; difficult to predict medium term, and long term - well, that is a matter of thoughtful long-term insight.
It's quite clear from the desperation from r/ShortyTheBearTrader 's multiple posts and sock puppets - his multiple accounts here - that he is in very deep trouble.
Take it easy mate.  I'm sure you'll make your shorting losses back somehow.
Bumping spiteful electrons around this board won't help you though - will it? :)

**Good evening my good Bitcoining friends!**
Just passing thru'.  Can't stay long.  A bit of an issue between Nursey and the household leopard.  Ended in tragedy I'm afraid.  Will have to get new leopard and pay Nursey's medical bills.
Anyway, haven't got time to read.
I guess the tl:dr is:
Trolls writing: it's a bubble / tulips / economics 101 / I predicted this fall in 1970 / 'nothing backing it up' / ponzi scheme /  I sold my wife on Forex / I shorted my Mom on    Gold stocks.
And Bitcoiners writing: Fuck off trolls.
That sort of thing?
Anyway, got to dash.  New crate of rare cats has arrived.
BTW: The Bcash ABC123XTZ-SV-0+RV-1-superhash-DEF_NOT_SHTCOIN family of lying shitcoins is almost dead at around 0.05.  Even when combined.  It is what Bcashers call reverse synergy.

But they are in a death struggle.  Even when combined, they can't even hold 5% of Bitcoin.
Shitcoins never die, they fade away.
I have always defined the death of Bcash at under 5%.
Arbitrary? - yep, OK :)
But the Bcash heart has stopped.  Maybe some hidden bullshit Bcash organ is still scavenging the final molecular remnants of the previously oxygenated blood supply.  But at some point, in modern medicine, death has to be declared.
Bcash is **DEAD.**

That is bullshit, and you know it.
This is not about emotional attachment - it is about honesty, integrity and logic.

I'm biased here against that shitcoin - that is in the open.  But I would ask myself these questions:
Where will you be able to sell it immediately post-fork?
Will exchanges be supporting its sale at all?  Or locked down against Bcash, trying to figure out what is happening (like everyone else, including Bcashers.)?
If there IS somewhere to sell it and get out, won't everyone else be there trying to sell at the same time?

When your Bcash was worth X% of BTC, it probably just meant your BTC holding were worth X% less.

Maybe, but exchanges have historically been slow to respond to Bcasher's demands to adjust tickers.

Bitcoin is a completely new and unknown asset.  Its 21 million cap is highly unusual.  For that reason alone it is almost impossible for it to have a floor of zero.
Imitators like Bcash, and virtually all altcoins, certainly have a potential floor of zero.
I spent a few hundred dollars for fun on ~~unnamed~~ coin in January, and its price now genuinely is zero!
Edit: and it is easy to overlook the fact that one Bitcoin is still worth over 5 ounces of Gold.  Think about that.

These, lady and gentlemen, are the lengthy and unwieldy tickers of true shitcoins :)

Another false argument.
I was saying that you couldn't.
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:51:59
But it was you who lost a huge amount investing in coins that that were not Bitcoin, due to your greedy, unwise, short term, fast and loose investments in altcoins (shitcoins) and ICOs (shitcoins)
But those coins were not Bitcoin.  So why continually come here to post?
There must be a reason for you to keep coming back here.
It won't reverse your losses and signal failures.

Bcash - what a mess.  They are scamming themselves now.
I hope people have thought this through: 
Buy Bcash in the hope of a profit from the 'airdrop' (the split coin.)  ?
But where are you going to sell that 'airdrop' - will the exchanges be open for it ?  I doubt it.  Even if some are, every silly bugger will be trying to offload it at once.
So you end up with two shitcoins.  One marginally or mightily shittier than the other. 
One unsaleable, and the other (the 'real' Bcash?) bought at an inflated price, but still dying and worthless.
This is popcorn time; not trading time in more shitcoins.
Bye Bcash.

And as for this 'conspiracy' that Bitcoiners like myself hate Bcash - well, of course we do!   Give me a good reason not to.  
Bcash has expended 90% of its fruitless energy and limited talents attacking Bitcoin; a coin without which you would be nothing.  So no conspiracy there I'm afraid. 
I honestly hope your shitty lying coin dies multiple deaths and fragments through the stupidity and mendacity of your corrupt leadership.

Unhackable as in brute force.  The private key written in word form has 24 (or optionally 25) words.  Chosen from a dictionary of 2000 words.  The words may even be used more than once, so the math is easy: that's at least 2000^24 combinations.  Which is roughly 10^79 combinations.  That's around the number of atoms in the observable universe.  Unguessable within billions of years using current computers, and millions of years even using some future iPhone - heh, that was a joke.
^(Edit.  The order matters, so I mean permutations rather than combinations, but hey, soz.)

I take a very simple stance: if it is not trusted, it can never be a viable currency, means of exchange or store of value.
Everything must be absolutely honest and up-front for any form of financial means of transaction to be successful.

My altcoin-loving shitcoin-gambling foolish friend, Lord Wankworth of Fuckton, tells me that it is now almost impossible to post or comment on the, allegedly censorship-free, r/ B T C.
Posting restrictions there, whilst they contentiously self-fork their own contentiously forked shitcoin, he tells me, are now so severe that almost all comments and postings are met with an auto-botty no-no message warning that accounts must mature by at least 6000 years for posts to be permitted.
'So much for lack of censorship', I said to him over supper last night.
'Fuck off' he replied, as he fondled Nursey in an ungentlemanly manner.
Lord Wankworth really is a rotter.  I privately suspect he is a Bcasher.  I always thought there was something a bit swivel-eyed about him.
p.s.  Lady Fuckton is charming though, and by all accounts lives up to her name.
p.p.s.  We had that computer wizz, Dr Wright, up from the village the other day to repair our laptop.  What a bore. He told us 'the electricity was going the wrong way through it' and wandered around my study in a pompous manner.  Not much help.  I'll get Mithins to take it to the experts at Walmart instead.

And that has been the massive strategic mistake made by Ver and his cadre.
I could create a coin today with a limit of 21 million.
All of these digital assets are just numbers.  Intangible electrons bumping around the world's networks!
So why - just why - would you put your valuable assets into an imitator?  And a discredited one at that.
Bcash is surrounded by controversy and characters like Faketoshi, convicted criminal Ver, dodgy character Ayres.

Yes.  But it doesn't work that way.  I'm no expert in, for example, irons (because maid does that for me.)
Should I really have to come on Reddit / and / or research irons to realise I am being ripped off in buying a rubbish one?  People don't have the time or inclination or energy.  Quite reasonably.
So I'd probably go to irons.com and buy the one that says 'recommended'.
In the same way that possibly hundreds of thousands of people have gone to Bitcoin.com and bought Bcash.
It is, in my opinion, unreasonable to expect everyone to be an expert in what they purchase and understand.

It makes a lot of sense.
If you need room heating, why push electrons through a heater, when you can push them through a processor that generates exactly the same heat output per second (current x input voltage), whilst potentially earning some crypto?
I suggest you research the power requirements of an S9 - because that, essentially, is its heat output.
A one bar electric fire outputs around 1kW.  1kW would keep the chill out of a good sized room, 2kW possibly keep it warm.
There will no doubt be better guesstimates online of the heating power required to heat typical sized rooms at different external temperatures.
Just a note of caution: some mining rigs go very cheap because protocols of coins have changed and superseded the rigs, making the rigs almost worthless.  
Techy note: the heating loss due to the energy consumed by the reversal of entropy in creation of a cryptocoin is extremely small.

All very calming for a true Bitcoiner.

Are you sure? - do you have to buy a mining rig, or have a large initial investment, to buy a fraction of a Bitcoin?
What nonsense.
@_date: 2018-12-14 19:22:36
It's just Bcash magnates selling off their millions of bags of Bcash shitcoins.
These failing bankrupt wankers have real Bitcoin holdings too - so selling real Bitcoin is the only way they can hold off the dogs.
Be patient.
p.s. Mods: Bcash is hugely relevant - central in fact - to what is going on here.  It is stupid to pretend otherwise, so stop shutting down my posts.

Ver was always a fan of second layer solutions like Lightning.  It is the only way to speed up a blockchain without compromising its security.
Only Ver's infinite capacity for being dishonest stopped him from saying this to his retard Bcasher acolytes - who are now looking at personal ruin.

Sadly I am serious.  Human freedom of will outweighs the rights of animals.  Personally, I would never hurt one of these magnificent creatures.  But most whale species are no longer endangered, and the Japanese are responsible and sophisticated enough to not hunt an endangered species.
There are people outside my estate right now who are freezing in the street.  
THAT should be the concern of humanity - and there are only so many 100 dollar bills I can give to people.
So, in short, fuck the whales and look after humans first.  Libtards.
Merry Christmas.
Oh, and by the way, I am an atheist.  But in the new testament there is barely a hint of hatred or violence (except Christ losing his rag in the temple and overtipping a few tables.)  There ARE religions that have violence built into their religious texts.  Why tolerate those beliefs?  Because why?  Because fashion?
@_date: 2018-12-12 21:03:57
Yes.  The sole reason for my hatred of Bcash is that it has been the only fork of Bitcoin that has had the bare faced dishonesty to pretend to be Bitcoin.
No other coin has had the mendacity and stupidity to do this, and I suspect it will never happen again.
I warned the Bcash oligarchs, months ago, including Roger Ver, that it wouldn't work; that is was fundamentally dishonest, and that they would lose credibility and value.
I've been proved right.

Evening Bitcoiners!
Now, whilst I try to be fair and reasonable with my staff, Cook recently tried to hide a pet kitten in her small room at the top of the house.  This is against estate rules.  No pets.  So I had McRupert the gamekeeper catch it and present it to my house leopard, and that was the end of that matter.
The reason I raise this, is that I did slacken my standards and deliberate cast a lazy eye over the fact she was then keeping a small goldfish, called Bcash, in her room to keep her company.  There are rules.  But I am known for my magnanimity.
Sadly, Bcash is sinking, and is now under the bottom 4% of its little tank.  Miggins thinks it is dead.  But it popped up a little, only to sink further.
Dr Faketoshi in the village - who is now claiming to have six doctorates in veterinary science, claims he can save it.  And Mr Ver, the bank manager, claims it is merely sleeping.
Anyway, far too much drama here.  I asked Nursey if I had reached the bottom.  She told me I was drunk and removed my hand from under her voluminous skirts.
I must have been drunk!  
@_date: 2018-12-19 16:13:07
You say tomato, I say potato.
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:29:05
Too much pumping going on.
Faketoshi just spent x-million pumping his version of Bcash shitcoin v2 up to 100 dollars.  To gain parity with Roger's Bcash shitcoin v1 (also at about 100 dollars.)
Sometimes - just sometimes - I wonder if Bcashers are a bunch of total fuckwits :)
Got to go.  Feeding time.

Oh, btw Chroko, you wrote above:

p.s.  That FaketoshiCoin is catching up on  RogerCoin in the race to the bottom!  100 USD each.

There's some serious high frequency wibbly-wobbly going on with RogerCoin's price.
Either it is trading bots overheating from the sheer bollocks and illogic of Roger's creation, or desperate attempts to stop that lying coin from crashing to near zero.

If his funds are in a wallet controlled by you - as you freely admit - then send them to him, and THEN deny him access to your services.
You have absolutely no legal or moral right to hold someone's funds in this way: it amounts to theft.

It won't happen again.
There are many offshoots of Bitcoin.
Bcash was unique in being the only one that not only claimed to be Bitcoin, but advertised itself as such and caused a lot of confusion.
Now Bcash - really the very worst of shitcoins - is struggling to hold any price.
Its credibility was shot long ago - and now it is 2 lying shitcoins - because these liars can't even get on amongst themselves.
No one - even someone as stupid as Ver - will attempt that stunt again.

Good question!
If the answer is yes, everyone would, or is, doing it, so you have no profit margin.
If the answer is no, then obviously don't do it.
If the answer is maybe - then maybe you need to have some special expertise, so posting on a sub-Reddit isn't a great start.
So, to summarise - for you - no.

Irrelevant.  
Wrong coin.
THIS CONFUSION is precisely what Ver and his criminal idiots have caused.,
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:49:17
It always has dragged down Bitcoin.
I honestly think it is hard to overestimate the damage that has been caused by Ver's stupid vanity / brand stealing project.
But Bcash is so close to dead now, that there is the opportunity to recover.
The only altcoin in history to claim widely and publicly to be another coin is effectively dead.
The only upside is that these mendacious liars have lost a shed load of money.
@_date: 2018-12-15 09:55:16
The definition of money is far more complex than that and you know* it.
@_date: 2018-12-16 16:01:21
I believe that the death of Bcash has always been a necessary requirement for Bitcoin recovering and flourishing - and it is happening.  Good times lie ahead for the World's greatest cryptocoin.
@_date: 2018-12-21 13:13:08
Yes.  A few million or less would do it.  Also, when they pump the price, wise guys get on board and ride it.
