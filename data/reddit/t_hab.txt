Yes, and that’s why a 10% reserve ratio can lead to a maximum of 10x money created ($1000 of inital deposit plus $9000 in total loans). Assuming every penny borrowed is redeposited you get $900 + $810 + $729 + ...
This is the origin of the common confusion that the bank can simply reloan ten times on each deposit and then do it again. 
Many people, especially scam artists and conspiracy theorists, play on this common misconception to peddle their wares.

Futures and options are, by their nature, useful for hedging. For example, if a company takes a purchase contract in bitcoin but wants to be hedged against the volatility of bitcoin, futures and options are the right financial instruments. 
ETFs offer no such hedging benefits. They are used to speculate and to invest. Strictly speaking, you can’t invest in assets that don’t and can’t generate cash flow. You can trade them, speculate in them, or, if they are certain kinds of assets, you can use them for their physical utility. ETFs do exist for speculative assets, but it’s a lot trickier. 
Of course, people will use futures and options to speculate, but that’s not their only function. Furthermore, most passive investors don’t use options and futures, meaning that the potential consequences to regular folk is contained.

Yes, but that’s equivalent to selling your long position. While there may be savings in transaction costs, ETFs are not a particularly compelling hedging instrument for assets that can be traded online.

Sure it does. Governments have a claim on the productivity under their legal jurisdiction. Whether or not this claim is morally correct or not, it exists. We call this claim "taxes". Most governments tax between 20% and 50% of GDP. While we typically measure GDP in the local currency (or USD), there is real productivity happening in the forms of goods, services, and capital investments. Since legal tender is the only way for you to cancel your debt with the government (except in rare, exceptional cases where debt is cancelled through imprisonment or by forfeiting property), this ties the value of the monetary base to a percentage of the net present value of the GDP, adjusted for risk and inflation. 


And in places where hyperinflation exists, this happens. At 2% inflation, it barely matters. 


No. Just because you can pay in a different currency, that doesn't matter. If you pay in BTC (or any other currency), that currency is converted into the local legal tender at the market rate. There is nothing that pegs the value of BTC to the production of any country (or anything else). While some future cryptocurrency might be legal tender, BTC is not. 


Why would you say that? About 10% of gold is used in industry, and that use is restricted by the high price. If the price started to drop, more would be demanded for industry. Even at its current high price industry demands a large amount. 


This puts the cart before the horse. The only reason it was precious in the first place was for its decorative value. It it pretty, does not tarnish, and is easily malleable. If it looked like crap and was brittle, it would never have had value in the first place. 


People living in those countries have better options rather than BTC. At most, only a small portion of people in those countries will switch over. Those are people rich enough to have good internet connections but not rich enough to have banking outside their home countries. 


This would only make sense if countries completely switched. That is to say, if the government abolished their own currency and made BTC legal tender. Extremely corrupt countries are the only ones where this might make sense, superficially, but those same countries would never do something that reduced their ability to steal.

Would you buy it at $1 if you could buy it at $.90? If the answer is yes, why? And if the answer is no, then you can see why there is no floor above zero.


Mining is already concentrating in the hands of relatively few companies. The six biggest already share about 80%. If the price goes down, that squeezes out the ones who have the least efficient operation. The ones who have the most efficient operation are the ones who are guaranteed to be left standing. If anyone can get a sustained cost advantage, it will represent what economists call a "natural monopoly". It's worth noting that, in real life, monopolies don't typically control 100% of the market. 80% is more than enough to consider a company a monopoly. Not only is this likely to happen, it is almost guaranteed to happen because of the inherent structure of BTC. 


Bitcoin's value is already zero. It's price isn't zero, but there is no underlying value. None. It is true that there will be forks and copies and, in the same way that when you shut down one pyramid scheme others pop up, scams like BTC will be hard to kill off. Each individual scam, however, will go to zero. 


Distributed ledgers have value. Blockchain technology is incredibly useful. Do not confuse those things with BTC, which has no value. It is, at best, a proof-of-concept of blockchain technology. It is a ledger that can only keep track of itself. 


BTC does not give you a share of the value of blockchain anymore than a hamburger gives you a share of McDonalds or a FB profile gives you a share of FB. BTC is just an application of blockchain technology. That's it. While scam artists will tell you it has value because BTC has a fixed supply, they are deliberately misleading you.  There is no fixed supply to the application of blockchain technology. When somebody resolves the remaining stubborn problems with blockchain technology and launches a coin with underlying value, BTC will not give you a claim on that coin. 


I'm open to being convinced by something that is actually true. You seem to have confused the value of blockchain (we agree 100%) with the value, or lack thereof, of BTC. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 05:43:06
Thank you.
$0 is simply based on the fact that there is no underlying value. None. The value of BTC is calculable and it is exactly zero. There is no commodity value (like gold) and there is not tax base (like fiat currency). There are no dividends or ownership (like stocks) and there are no legal obligations (like bonds). There is no source of value. It is an incredible proof of concept of blockchain technology, but there is no financial value to Bitcoin. 
Of course, price and valuation don't always coincide, especially in the short run. The price is whatever the marginal investor believes it should be. This market price gives Bitcoin an incredible amount of usefulness. It allows BTC to be a store of value (insofar as the price is stable) and as a means of transaction. If the price drops, its usefulness does to. There is no floor to the price of BTC established by extrinsic factors, just as there is no ceiling to the price of BTC. That's another way of saying the price is entirely, 100% speculative.

Warning: I believe that Bitcoin is worth $0. I come in peace and only want to share some insight on the article. If you think my valuation makes me crazy, feel free to ignore and down-vote. 
This article is, unfortunately, wishful thinking. Wishful thinking sometimes pans out, but saying "If the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs attracts 20% of the available equities trading market" is as baseless here as when some entrepreneur says "If my new search engine can attract just 1% of Internet users it will be worth a fortune."
Bitcoin ETFs are extremely easy to trade, but also make it possible to make derivatives (e.g. options) that are far more secure than the ones trading on OTC markets. That makes it possible for people like me to properly bet against Bitcoin. I can't currently make the bets against BTC that I want to make, but I will be able to once an ETF is introduced. I represent a relatively small amount of money, but I believe that there are some major players who want to make similar plays the moment they become possible.
In short, not all ETFs create net long positions. For an example, check what happened to volatility after ETFs like VXX were introduced. VXX isn't a great comparison for a lot of technical reasons, but it is a recent example of a net short position on an ETF. Maybe this net short position will never happen and maybe Bitcoin will prove resistant against it, but it is worth being aware of the possibility. 
The big players in Hedge Funds aren't just doing intrinsic valuations and hoping for market correction like I do. Instead, these funds look for markets events that they can make happen. One weak point on Bitcoin (an all proof-of-work cryptocurrencies) is that if the market price of Bitcoin is persistently lower than the cost of mining Bitcoin, many mining operations will be forced to cease operations. Mining is key to the functionality and security of Bitcoin, and in this way Hedge Funds can make a run on Bitcoin using ETFs. This play is quite easy and well-documented, as George Soros did it to the Bank of England when their balance sheet made no sense. The ideal timing of this play isn't clear, but as mining gets more expensive over time, the play becomes cheaper to do. 
TL;DR SEC approved Bitcoin ETFs would allow kinds of bets against Bicoin that currently cannot be made. Hedge Funds can, theoretically, make a run on Bitcoin using these short plays that would push Bitcoin's market value below the break-even point for miners. As always, don't hold your life savings in one single asset. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 01:27:56
Aren't the costs of mining about $2000 in China, where there is very cheap electricity and more than half of all new Bitcoins mined? 
As the price of mining BTC goes up (new competitors and difficulty adjustments), the break-even cost goes up. If the price of BTC drops below the break-even price, miners will drop out. As miners drop out, the break-even price goes down (i.e. if there are half as much hash power the rewards for mining effectively double), but each time the difficulty adjusts, the break-even price goes up. 
Pushing aside 99.99% of miners isn't realistic, so my comment comes across as facetious, but my overall point is what percentage would it take to make BTC significantly less secure. At what point could one single miner be doing over half the proof-of-work. Is that system vulnerable to attack? Or what happens if you have more than half the hash power move over to something else instead of BTC. Does that create a shift in power in the cryptocurrency world?
@_date: 2018-06-25 20:43:45
I agree that there is still a spectrum, but my understanding is that this spectrum has narrowed considerably. Remember, if you are mining at a cost of $2500 and BTC is priced at $6000, and you have the opportunity to move to a place with costs of $1800, you will do so. The pressure and benefit to migrate exists and has existed.
This pressure has created clustering. This clustering has created a narrower point where miners experience a break-even. 
This clustering is going to happen more and more and the spectrum will, by necessity, get smaller and smaller. This happens across the world in all sorts of markets, from finance to manufacturing. 
So while the hash rate has never collapsed, the risk of a hash rate collapses increases with time as break-even points cluster.

But remember we're dealing with whats probably the most volatile market in the history of the world.
It's one of the more volatile markets, sure, but there are plenty of others that were just as volatile, if not more. None that are particularly optimistic comparisons, unfortunately, but I digress. 


Absolutely, but there is a limit to how long they will, or how long they will want to. 


The idea, more simply, is that there are plenty of people/institutions (let's call them Hedge Funds) with a lot of money who don't believe in the long-term value of Bitcoin. Alternatives for shorting BTC are currently pretty bad, especially for these types of Hedge Funds. The existence of an SEC-approved ETF created by a robust institution and traded on a solid exchange creates opportunities for shorts that the cryptocurrency world has not yet seen. 
These short plays can force the price of Bitcoin down, at least temporarily, and many of these Hedge Funds will want to force the price down for their own purposes. 
Since so much of what BTC provides is based on mining, a convenient target for these Hedge Funds is the miners. If they can push out many miners, that could have unpredictable effects on the BTC network. The network, in theory, becomes a little less secure. The miners become less diverse (one or two miners might be doing most of the work). The miners who are no longer profitable with BTC might move their hash-power to other cryptos, which could make them more popular and divert funds away from BTC. In short, it's a bit of a Pandora's box.


This is an excellent point. While the equilibrium is constantly being adjusted in this way, the worldwide rewards for mining as measured in BTC are also going down. And unless electricity prices drop, or unless BTC goes up exponentially forever, the amount of computer power dedicated to mining will have to go down over time. How much computing power is too little?
@_date: 2018-06-25 20:03:44
What utility does BTC have that is not related to its price? Without price it is neither a store of value nor is it a currency. Without price it cannot transfer value either. For Bitcoin specifically to have usefulness in, say, Venezuela, it needs to have some promise of price stability as well as some promise for security. If it doesn't have those, Venezuelans will prefer other methods of getting their capital out of Caracas. 
Edit: And it's nice to share with you as well. Cheers for the exchange!
@_date: 2018-06-25 20:25:26


Of course they won't fold, but let's say that you are running a mining operation in China. You estimate that it costs you $2000 per Bitcoin. Most of that is variable cost (especially electricity), but there is a small amount of fixed cost (e.g. rent). If the Price of Bitcoin is above your variable cost, you keep producing. If the price of bitcoin is below your variable cost, it is cheaper for you to turn off your rigs and buy bitcoin on the open market. Your variable cost is your break-even. 


Agreed, but most mining is clustered in specific countries with cheap electricity, like China, so the vast majority of miners have similar costs and they have a reasonably good estimate. There are some miners running small rigs that require minimal upkeep and use solar energy, so their costs is negligible, but they are a tiny fraction of overall mining. Other miners have very high costs, but again, they represent a relatively small proportion of mining, so they aren't very important either. 


The difficulty in estimating something is unrelated to its existence. While I agree with you that the break-even is not universal, obviously, that just makes the analysis slightly harder. Not much harder, mind you, but harder. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 19:59:50
What about 99.99% of miners? 
@_date: 2018-06-27 05:52:09


Not at all. 
Dollars can be used to cancel your debt with the government. If you are referring to the US dollar, it's the US government. If you are referring to the Canadian dollar, it's the Canadian government, and so on and so forth. This property is called "legal tender". Governments have the legal right to tax a certain percentage of the production within their legal domain. In the USA, that's about 25% of GDP. If you produce anything of economic value while being a US citizen or resident, you need USD in order to cancel your debt with the government. 
Stocks don't actually work that way either. Stocks give you ownership over a company. That either gives you rights to dividends today or the hopes of dividends in the future. You literally have part ownership of a legal structure and real assets. There is an expected financial return to owning stocks, even if you don't sell them. 
For gold, about 10% is used in industry and about 50% is used for decorative purposes (especially jewelry). The price of gold does not impact its usefulness for these purposes. 


Anything is possible, but if the argument is that BTC has value because of Venezuela and Zimbabwe, that's only a small amount of value. And it's not clear that BTC is the best alternative for Venezuelans and Zimbabweans. 


Hedge funds are always looking for the next great shorting opportunity. 


Those exchanges all have ridiculous counter-party risk. They are either OTC exchanges (you are betting against a specific person who, if they can't pay, the exchange won't make it up to you) or they are exchanges that are heavily invested in cryptocurrencies themselves, so if there is a crash in the market, they have no money to pay you with. Why would anybody take a short position that they will never be paid for in the event they are right?
@_date: 2018-06-26 01:52:53
I am and I am. The difficulty adjustments roughly guarantee that somebody will always be able to mine profitably, provided the price isn't zero, but the computing power dedicated to mining can go up or down. 
People mining at a loss is economically irrational, but hey, that happens a lot, at least for some amount of time. Some people do it small-scale because somebody else is paying for their electricity (a parent, a landlord, an employer, etc), some people do it because they have high fixed costs (maybe they cover their electricity costs, but are losing due to the rent money they owe), and some people are doing it for financially dumb reasons. 
Nonetheless, I don't think that the BTC network should bank on a significant amount of hash power coming from miners losing money consistently.

The U.S. government has defaulted on certain commitments. 
If the U.S. defaults on stocks or bonds, it will have a harder time borrowing for a few years. That will reduce demand for U.S. investments and devalue the dollar a bit. Of course, to avoid defaulting, the U.S. could print more money (borrow from itself), which could push down the dollar more. 
Government defaults are a fascinating area of discussion, but I feel like it's a bit off-topic. Again, I'm happy to engage on that, I just want to be aware of not stepping on toes while I am in @_date: 2018-06-27 06:21:16
Sure. I'm off to bed soon, so I will write this up relatively quickly, but I will try to do it some justice. And feel free to ask follow-ups that I will be happy to answer at some point tomorrow. 
**The first part of the premise is to understand the difference between price and value.** In efficient markets, price and value are similar most of the time, and when they aren't, they eventually converge. 
**Bitcoin has a price, obviously, but it has no value.** All of Bitcoin's usefulness is linked to its price. There aren't that many sources of value. In finance, the most common ones are commodity value (e.g. gold can be used in industry and it can be used for jewelry) and intrinsic financial value (if you own a stock, bond, or real estate property, you expect a financial return on that, and if you calculate the risk-adjusted net present value of those payments, you can calculate the intrinsic financial value). There are other forms of value, however, such as emotional value (if you have a pet or a child, you don't think of their value as being the cashflow they can generate) and utility (your television is worth more than the materials that are in it because it can provide entertainment). 
**It is important to note that any "value" that is derived from the price is not true value.** It's market price. Your television's value is how much enternainment it provides, not the price you can sell it at and not its ability to store value. 
**All of BTC's supposed value comes from its price.** If it is useful as a store of value, that's because it has a stable or rising price. If it is useful for transactions, that is because it has a stable price. Those uses are all based on market price, not underlying value. None of the features of BTC give it any underlying value. BTC does not give you a claim on blockchain technology nor does it pay dividends in any legal tender.
**What this means is that BTC's price is entirely and 100% speculative. There is no floor just as their is no ceiling.** It only has a market "value" (which should be stated as "market price"), not an underlying value. Furthermore, there are structural elements of BTC that prevent it from ever acquiring underlying value. This may not be true for future applications of blockchain technology, but there are some tough technical challenges to solve. **The easiest way to think of this is that, if nobody is willing to pay you for your BTC, you can't do anything with it.** 
If you are with me so far, and you understand the power and dangers of speculative markets, the next step is pretty simply. Bullish trends can push it up (just as people emptying their Swiss bank accounts before new disclosure rules last year pushed it up) and Bearish trends can push it down. 
If there is a run on BTC (shorting puts downwards pressure on an asset as it effectively creates a temporary over-supply) that will severely reduce the amount of hash power dedicated to BTC mining and it may consolidate mining into the hands of very few mining companies, perhaps even pushing over 50% of mining into the hands of one company. 
**How do you think the market will feel if BTC loses 50% of its value every two weeks for a few months in a row while the mining gets concentrated in fewer and fewer hands?** How do you think the average person will feel? Would that not create a bearish trend? **If there is no stability BTC is useless as a currency. If prices fall for a while BTC is useless as a store of value.** The path to zero is the same as it was for tulips or any other speculative good. 
**As for why shorting of this nature can't happen without an ETF, there are a few reasons. The institutions with enough capital to push this play are the same institutions that are not typically allowed to invest in unregulated markets. The main reason, however, has to do with counter-party risk.** If this bet were made successfully, you would currently be betting against people who couldn't afford to pay you if BTC dropped significantly. Unregulated OTC markets basically let you bet against people while the exchange acts as a matchmaker. The few exchanges that guarantee these positions are overly invested in cryptocurrencies, so would be just as vulnerable. **Why would anybody make a billion dollar bet when they won't be paid if they win?**
**The moment an SEC-regulated ETF created by one of the big ETF originators exists, all that changes.** Counter-party risk drops to almost zero and investment restrictions vanish. It's open hunting season on Bitcoin. If any major Hedge Fund decides to take this position aggressively, it could create drastic changes in the price of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 05:37:45


This has never been true for any asset bubble. If it is trending towards zero, speculation will not be its saviour. Obviously that's a big "if", but the consequence is fairly clear. 


The only reasonable "valuation" is $0. There is no dividend payment, or potential dividend payment, from owning Bitcoin. There is no ownership over anything tangible. Bitcoin only has market price. It has no underlying value. On the market, it is worth what people think it is worth. No more, no less. There is not price at which a "reasonable valuation" can save further decline. This should be an obvious and clear fact to anybody considering putting money into bitcoin. Just as there is no ceiling on the speculation, there is no floor. 


There are currently no good ways to take major short positions. I know that many people who don't have much familiarity with financial markets think there are, but there aren't. Each shorting method has too much counterparty risk. That is to say, if you bet on Bitcoin going to zero and you are right, the people you are betting against cannot afford to pay you. 


By this logic Madoff's scam wasn't a scam until it was and Dutch tulips were worth fortunes right until they weren't. 
Are you really telling me that if Bitcoin drops in price and one single miner has 80% of the hash power because their operation was more efficient, that won't have any impact on how people see the future potential of Bitcoin? I mean, you could be right, but that sounds very strange to me. Bitcoin has built a large part of its brand on democratization of security and finance. If one firm is responsible for most of its functionality, that won't tarnish the brand?
@_date: 2018-06-26 00:56:25
That's an excellent point. That's not where I spend my time in investments, but perhaps I should. If you have wallets on various exchanges, and you are proactive, you might be able to rack up a fair bit of money. You could even write basic scripts to warn you when opportunities arise. Of course, I'll leave that to somebody more active in the crypto space. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 20:15:36
I don't think that brokerages will bother to hold significant amounts of BTC, except on behalf of their clients, but creators of ETFs like Blackrock or Proshares might (and should) in order to cover themselves from major losses. Investors (or, more accurately, traders) such as Hedge Funds and arbitrage traders should also buy BTC or something reliably linked to BTC in quantities that make sense according to their investment position. 
It is certainly relevant, but its importance will depend on scale. If it happens large-scale, it might help create resistance to the effects of short-traders. If it doesn't happen large-scale, it might allow the price to be pushed down more easily. 
It also might have an undesired effect on regulation. If any major player in the financial world starts to hold a significant amount of BTC, regulators around the world will focus on the cryptocurrency world in a way that they never have before. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 20:27:53
Arbitrage opportunities don't seem to exist because arbitrage traders are extremely efficient. As soon as an arbitrage opportunity becomes available, a computer programme executes the trade. If they can make fractions of a penny, they do so. This is precisely why derivatives are almost perfectly linked to the underlying asset.
@_date: 2018-06-25 18:46:32


My understanding on this is admittedly superficial, but I thought that the vase majority of mining was already done in countries with cheap electricity (especially China) and that their break-even point was currently around $2000. While their cost of electricity shouldn't change much, their pay-out as measured in BTC will drop. For those operations to remain profitable, BTC needs to stay ahead of the break-even price for mining in countries with cheap electricity. 
That is to say, if the break-even point for low-cost producers is $2000, a drop from $6000 to $2100 would have virtually no impact on hash rate, but a drop from $2100 to $1900 would. 


When you do valuations, you have no idea what will trigger a correction. Some correct valuations take decades to bear out. Identifying triggers is often more difficult than doing a good valuation. 
For example, one trigger that forced the price of Bitcoin up last year was the reduction of secrecy in Swiss Banking that came into effect January 1st, 2018. On Jan. 1st, Swiss banks began to share information with the US government. Some people took the time to set up structures in countries like Panama, but others decided that the easiest thing was to put their money in Bitcoin and then move it into a new account, fully laundered. A massive amount of money moved into BTC and then back out again. This trigger for a massive rise in price is ridiculously easy to identify in hindsight, but incredibly difficult to identify retroactively. Many of those same people got an extra gift when Trump allowed money to be repatriated at a discounted rate, so the newly laundered money could come back home cheaply, but that was an unintended consequence, so I digress. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 18:49:30
Derivatives always impact the price of underlying assets because of arbitrage trading. When you have a fully developed financial market for an asset, you can trade multiple derivatives to guarantee instant profits if there is any disagreement between the derivatives and the underlying asset.

I think you missed (or ignored) my point about Hedge Funds and shorting if a proper ETF comes along.
If you want to focus on why I think Bitcoin is worth precisely $0 in the long run, that's an entirely different conversation, and while I am happy to engage (please feel free to send me a PM), I'm aware that I am posting on and I am not here to denigrate those who believe in its long term value. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 18:33:12
I pointed out that for technical reasons, VXX is not like any prospective Bitcoin ETF. The point of using it was to show that ETFs can create net short positions. That's something the author didn't seem to consider. 
And I am fully aware that this is only one side of it. I bring it up specifically because the article ignored this side and many Bitcoin enthusiasts that I speak to seem to be completely unaware of the shorting possibilities that do not currently exist in the crypto world.  
As for comparisons to GLD, you can make that comparison. In the end, a Bitcoin ETF would be somewhat unlike any ETF that currently exists, so it would each comparison is just a narrative with nuggets of usefulness. 
GLD doesn't have the same shorting opportunities, however. The usefulness of the underlying asset does not depend on mining or its market price. If you could get enough capital to short gold to $1 for a full year, you might kill some smaller mining companies, but gold would retain its industrial and decorative properties. The commodity value of gold exists independently of the market price, and no financial manipulation can make gold less useful. 
Bitcoin "miners" (a term that is deliberately misleading), on the other hand, play a fundamental role in the security of Bitcoin. If a significant number of them can be put out of business, it might open a huge can of worms. There is nothing underlying the value of bitcoin (which is at the heard of my argument for its long-term value of $0), so it is unclear how Bitcoin would react under a short-term run on miners. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 21:09:47


Thank you. And so long as we're getting into the weeds, I would like to clarify "price" vs. "value". It can be misleading to refer to the market price as "value", because then we can think of any price being justified. Value is what exists independent of price. 
While you can (and I do) make the argument for underlying value of legal tender (money that can be used to cancel debts with the government), it's often easier to think of currencies as having a price but not a value. Aswath Damodaran makes this argument a lot, and he's a lot smarter than I am. 
That basically means the usefulness of Bitcoin, as a currency, is directly linked to whatever its price is and how stable that price is. It also means that analogies to commodities (like gold, silver, aluminum) are dangerously misleading. You are correct, though, that if Bitcoin retains any price above zero, and does so somewhat stably, it has some usefulness.

It’s only funny if you don’t have money in it. Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme. There is zero doubt about it. It’s a textbook case. It generates no profits, can pay no dividends, gives you no ownership over anything, is not a commodity, and has no other source of underlying value. You buy it hoping that you can trade it later at a higher value. The only way for an investor to do well on a Bitcoin investment is to be paid out by later investors. That’s the definition of a puramid scheme. All profits from early investors come from later investors.

Bitcoin will go to zero. It is a pyramid scheme. It has no underlying value. Please do not confuse it with a store of value.

Okay, so let's take my broken analogy and fix it a little. I am having a few conversations in parallel here and I do feel like I am learning more on the subject, so bear with me while I try to get it. 
Let's say that the coat hangers are integral to the transportation system, but the transportation system can only transport coat hangers. Would these coat hangers then have value to you? 
If yes, why? If no, what is the difference between these coat hangers and bitcoin? What else does bitcoin allow you to send through as information and is this where you see bitcoin having intrinsic value?

Nothing. The value of US dollars comes from the legal legitimacy of the US government to levy taxes on its tax base. Society may continue to accept it for a while and it may continue to have market value indefinitely, but it loses its intrinsic value the day the US government falls (unless the subsequent regime decides to adopt the US dollar). 


Just to clarify, when we say "interact with the Bitcoin network" we are, in part, talking about the bitcoin marketplace, correct?

I think your post highlights a fundamental disagreement here. I will respond, line by line, so that you can highlight where I am missing something. Essentially, I think everything you are saying is true and accurate and that's why I have a problem with bitcoin. 


Agreed, but one side of the transaction receives Bitcoin, which means they should have some form of intrinsic value to back up this market value. 


Yes, Bitcoins are limited, but cryptocurrencies as a whole are not, correct? Is it a stretch to say that new cryptocurrencies can be created with all the same technological benefits of Bitcoin? Anyway, this isn't the core of my argument, so you can ignore it if it will take us on a tangent. 


Agreed. 


Agreed, which is exactly the problem I am trying to highlight. When market values grow apart from intrinsic values, we get speculative bubbles. When things with no intrinsic value have large market values, we get the most devastating kinds of bubbles, that is to say bubbles where early investors lose everything. 


Yes, with the added benefit of being able to pay your taxes in it as it is legal tender. This is where it gets its intrinsic value from, so the rest is a bonus. 


And here is my fear. If I buy Bitcoin am I just buying a coat hanger that people currently ascribe market value or am I buying something that has fundamental, intrinsic value for which the game simply can't just end?

I would agree with this. The main use of money is to act as a ledger. For this to work, however, there has to be some guarantee that the money will be worth something next year or you will render a service today and not be able to buy a service in the future. This is where the concept of intrinsic value comes in.


Economic history is full of different types of money. The two that have the longest staying power typically either have intrinsic value as commodity money (either it's made of a valuable metal or it can be directly exchanged for a valuable metal) or as fiat money backed by a large government. Because fiat money is legally used to pay taxes and taxes are a legal claim that the government has on all the productivity in the country, fiat money has intrinsic value, albeit through two legal jumps. 
I would suggest that any money that does not have intrinsic value in one form or another is vulnerable to go to zero. 


I have heard of this, but I do not know much about it. 


I do not know what the societal laws, norms, or taboos were. For example, was a stone disc given a conversion value into goods? Was 1 disc, for example, equal to 1 cow, 12 chickens, or 15 bags of rice? Was there taxation of any sort payable in discs? In a small enough society social pressure can effectively replace laws and the value of these discs could be enforced through law or through culture which would give them the same value as a commodity money (worth a certain amount of food) or a fiat money (worth something through taxation. Because I don't know the finer points, I can't give you a good answer on whether or not it has intrinsic value. 
What seems to be clear, however, is that the society's continued use of the system meant the currency had staying power. This hasn't typically been the case with currencies that don't have intrinsic value. Free banking has existed before. In the USA, free banking lasted less than 30 years and most of the currencies became worthless much faster. In Scotland, to take the other extreme, the most stable currencies in the free banking era were backed by commodity or legal ability to pay taxes and this free banking era was shockingly stable for a long time with few currency issuers going out of business.

So this would qualify as a market value (price), not an intrinsic value. This would be what I meant when I said the "bitcoin marketplace."


Could you elaborate on these a bit? What kind of arbitrary data are we talking about? What kind of digital assets are we talking about?

Listing the reasons why people make changes is the heart of it though, so I'm glad you went there. For example, if the only changes you can make are to do with transaction record-keeping, then bitcoin is only useful to track itself. Without underlying value, it's a bit like the myth of Sysiphus, where a man had to do a lot of work pushing a stone up a hill only to see it roll back down and repeat the cycle for eternity. It would be work for work's sake. 
Editing the blockchain for other uses, even one as trivial as a concert ticket, gives real intrinsic value. It's hard to calculate what that intrinsic value should be, but it exists, which is the core of what we were discussing. If this were an you would get a delta on this point alone. While I might still struggle to understand the very high market valuation of bitcoin, I no longer struggle to see that it should have a value. 


This would be my next concern on trying to attribute a value to it. Why would somebody need bitcoin? Couldn't any cryptocurrency theoretically work? Couldn't another cryptocurrency be better designed to transport deeds, dollars, tickets, secret formulas, etc, by expanding those 80 bytes to, say, 1MB? Couldn't bitcoin be the Altavista to somebody else's Google? Or is there something special about bitcoin that makes it unique and inimitable?

I will answer directly myself with the analogy I gave Imagine that somebody invents a teleportation machine. Currently, they only use the teleportation machine to sent broken coat hangers. Sending broken coat hangers is a wonderful, safe, and elegant way to show that the technology works. This is clearly a technology that will change the world. 
People start collecting these coat hangers because they want to be part of this technology. Does the fact that these coat hangers, which give you the rights to absolutely nothing and have no intrinsic value all of a sudden become valuable because they have been sent through a teleportation machine?

To clarify, are you suggesting that bitcoins are like empty transports that today carry no useful content but that, one day, could, and therefore they have use as the method of transfer? 
@_date: 2015-11-04 03:53:14
Why would you say that the concept of intrinsic value is stupid? 
Some people do make this argument and argue that market value is the only value that matters, but these people are few and far between in economics, because it then follows that all market bubbles, all speculative investments, and all Ponzi schemes really made sense because there was a subjective value. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 15:28:35


No problem. If the analogy is no longer useful, I will drop it. 




Wonderful. With you so far. 


Is it really in finite supply though? Isn't the technology perfectly reproducible? Is bitcoin the only secure cryptocurrency with these features? Is it impossible for other cryptocurrencies to get these features? 


I'm reading through the whitepaper now in an effort to improve my understanding, but what I'm trying to get at, and is still eluding me, is where is the intrinsic value in a bitcoin. The perfect record or ledger is wonderful, but only if it is recording something of use. A ledger that records the history of the ledger doesn't address my concerns. 
There's lots of people who believe int he value of Bitcoin, which means that if you guys are right, I am missing something. That something isn't to do with the cool applications of the technology or its record keeping, it has to do with the intrinsic value of bitcoin as a currency. I just don't get it. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 04:38:37




Yes, up to here I am good. To clarify (I just asked a similar question to somebody else who made a similar point to yours), are you suggesting that the value of bitcoins is that they can be used to transfer other information and not just themselves? And therefore that they have intrinsic value not as cash but as a transport mechanism (for information)? 
Edit: just to be sure that I am being clear, are you suggesting that the value in bitcoins is that they can transfer all sorts of information or is their value still primarily that they can transport themselves in a secure way? 
@_date: 2015-11-04 04:34:03
I guess the easiest way to explain what I mean is to differentiate between two kinds of value: market value and intrinsic value. The first is typically called "price" but both are often used interchangeably. In perfectly efficient markets, both should be the same. Still, we know that markets aren't perfect and on many occasions we have seen investors lose everything after paying a lot for something that was worth very little. 
So try, if you can, to forget what somebody is willing to trade you for a bitcoin. The most common sources of intrinsic value are direct usefulness (e.g. the nutritional/culinary value of an apple), productivity (e.g. you own a company that produces goods or services that people want and can be expected to continue to want), or a legal claim (e.g. you own shares in a company). There can be other sources, such as you like to own a book, movie, or piece of art because it gives you pleasure (utility).
And this is where I struggle. I see that people are willing to pay and trade for bitcoins, which shows that they clearly have market value. That's not in dispute. I also see clear value in a network that allows the secure transfer of information in a decentralized manner with essentially no counter-party risk. That means the technology in and of itself clearly has value, as I see it. 
What I don't see is where an individual bitcoin, transferred through this technology, creates any form of wealth transfer beyond a market transaction. The bitcoin itself does not, as far as I can tell, have direct use (you can't eat it, make something with it, watch it, read it, appreciate it, etc) and it does not give you any legal dominion over any asset with direct use. 
So without relying on market value, I was hoping to understand where bitcoin gets its value. This might seem like a strange distinction to you, but the best definition of an economic bubble that we have is when market values and intrinsic values start to get really far apart (or, in extreme cases, where an asset has a value of zero but a price above zero). So I find myself in the bizarre situation where I really like the idea of the underlying technology but I fail to see any value in the currency. Any time I ask somebody to explain it to me, they either rely on telling me that the technology is cool (agreed) or that other people are willing to accept it in exchange for goods and services (agreed), but neither of those responses resolves my confusion.

Price is actually the only thing bitcoin has. It cannot give you a return on investment, it is not a commodity, and no government links it to GDP through taxation. Bitcoin is only worth what the market is willing to exchange it for, for better or for worse. There is no underlying value, only a market price.
