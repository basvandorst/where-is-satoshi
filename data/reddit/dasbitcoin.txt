No that won't work because the block headers would not match, once the fork happens nodes would not accept bitcore blocks and vice versa.

The down voting blockstream trolls are numerous here.

If you look at all the BIPs that have been sent in aside from BIP101 they basically don't compromise at all. One of them allows the block size to be reduced to 8KB in 2 years with just 25% of the hashing power.  Another one is just an increase to 2 MB. The last "compromise" was an increase to 2 MB by something like 2020 and would been implemented in 1 and a half years from now.

You see you did that thing where u called it an altcoin.  An altcoin starts off with a different genesis block and blockchain.  When a fork occurs in Bitcoin it's still Bitcoin, like the last 3 times we had a fork.

He did not fork the bitcoin block chain he forked the code, he started a new block chain.  There is a difference.
@_date: 2015-08-20 18:29:46
No you are quite simply wrong.

Price and adoption was set back by the current dev team that has been stalling block size solution for 2 years.

25% of hashing power can reduced block size to 8 kb in 2 years.

There's a block stream crowd?
@_date: 2015-08-27 17:50:44
I've been running several nodes for several years and I don't have a problem with 8MB blocks.
But they also ignore the fact that blocks won't be 8MB for years.
Also if 8 MB blocks where all full it means Bitcoin would be very successful and the price would reflect that.

Gavin gave control of Bitcoin Core to the current dev team.  All he wants to see is the block size implemented in a way that is compatible with user and infrastructure growth.
It's just a BIP 101 implementation. The current dev team could just add BIP101 to the code base.
After the block size issue is addressed, there would be no way to fork Bitcoin again for any agenda based motive.

Ya we got Gavin.

Yes but with BIP100 one miner can impose that restriction onto other miners.
@_date: 2015-08-26 22:10:33
How about BIP101 and then re-asses in 4 years?
@_date: 2015-08-20 19:58:44
I think he's referring to IBLT

Blocksize was never part of the consensuses layer, its a transport layer metric. Like when the genesis block was created.

All those proposals are the same. 
This sounds like a cold fusion workshop, lots of talk and money but no results.
At the end of the day you can't practically store more than 1 change in a ledger with less than 1 bit of information.
Transaction data is already so optimised that any attempts at compression actually increase the size of the transaction.
Even if some magical formula allowed for 10x transaction data to be stored in the same amount of space as a single tx none of the BIP proposals by the core team would allow for enough space to allow Bitcoin to scale in any meaningful way.
This will be clear in time.

With regards to price/transaction I don't think previous history is anything to go by, especially when u consider that the run up to $1000 was not as market driven as some people might think (Willybot etc)
Most bandwidth usage is not taken up by  sending or receiving blocks but by relaying transactions, which can be throttled by limiting the amount of connections a node has which is easily set in Bitcoin.conf, maxconnections=20 for example.

A fork with 25% of the hashing power would produce a block once an hour, nobody is going to wait around and have their mining power wasted.

That's true, which is why we should switch proof of work to sha512 and let individual users vote with their GPUs. It would be good for resetting decentralisation.
@_date: 2015-09-01 18:19:50
Touché lol

The community of users that have been running nodes for the past 6 years and knew all along this change was necessary.  Then u guys showed up.
