I have done, 
Simply a case of 2 adverts on localbitcoins, one to buy in my home country at spot price and one more to sell with a small markup in the country where I wanted to send money, both trades were done with a national bank transfer and the intended recipient simply confirmed me that they had received the bank transfer on the other end before i released the bitcoins from my lbc account.
When the money arrived it was 5% larger than when it was sent.

So side chains are not able to be trustless or decentralised initially ..


Can you elaborate on this because it seems like a hard fork level consensus is required for every individual side chain that wants to transition to being trustless, unless I'm not understanding something..
Edit .. also how can we measure popularity of a side chain?
@_date: 2016-08-01 11:42:52
First you need your private key, you can hopefully get that from your seed and using bip32.org
Then you'll need to find the original transaction on a block explorer so you can determine which inputs it used.
Then you have to construct a raw transaction which uses the same inputs but with a higher fee. You can possibly use bitcoin core or bitcore library from bitpay or similar to create this.
Then you have to contact mining pools and send them the raw transaction and ask them to mine it.

Large multi sigs are taken care of with Schnorr and message signing keys are resolvable simply with zero improvements by people just simply not being worried about quantum attacks or if they are by signing a message that includes 'next address' and then by immediately moving coins to that address.

For larger amounts I pay £25 for an international wire to bitstamp then the money gets converted directly from GBP to USD by bitstamp bank at a reasonable exchange rate, for smaller amounts you can only really pay a markup via bittylicious, coinfloor brokers etc .. these at least use faster payment and are therefore almost instant.  I don't know why you'd use sepa .. that means going from GBP to EUR and then to USD and having 2 banks fees involved with 2 separate spreads in the exchange rate ..

theymos kindly tried to explain some of this to me recently but I still don't quite get it ..
Am I right in thinking that each sidechain will need to obtain soft fork level consensus before it can be decentralized and trustless, so this federated beginning is a way to bootstrap before that is achieved ? 
Does that mean all the members of the initial signing federation need to be publicly known and identified ?

Could be a couple of things, 
First, People can profit from price movements in both directions.
Second, people often use walls like that to support a certain price. For example If I want to buy a lot of coins and Im happy to pay 100 but I don't want to pay more than that, I can use my existing coins and put a large sell order in at 101, that way while I'm scooping up all the offers as they come in at 100 nobody can move the price higher. 
@_date: 2016-08-31 03:27:48
A 3% markup is pretty standard on LBC, there are costs involved in buying bitcoin from exchanges and reselling them on LBC and of course its fair to make a little profit if you are saving people the hassle of waiting for registration and verification on an exchange. The country I was selling in has no bitcoin exchanges and the markups from other vendors in that country are often 10-15% because it also has capital controls and bitcoin is a legal grey area so there aren't really many options for people there. I had no trouble finding buyers who were prepared to do a national bank transfer to my intended recipient. As for your second question, why not have a look yourself ?

If you want your mac and your iphone to both hold the same set of keys and then you create a wallet on one device and export the seed and then use the same seed to  create a wallet on the second device.

No, thats exactly the opposite of correct. There is a reason why most voting today is done on slips of paper inside curtained booths.
If a voter can prove which way he voted then he is able to be coerced, if her cant prove it he cant possibly be coerced.  Its as simple as 'either you prove to me that you voted how i told you too or im going to break you legs'. But if a would be coercer knows that the voting is implemented in such a way as to prevent anyone from being able to prove it, why would he attempt coercion or bribery, there is no way for him to be sure he is getting what he wants.  
This is basic stuff that goes right back to the ancient greeks who devised systems of coloured balls in containers behind curtains with everyone being given one of each colour on the way in and told to throw one in the 'my vote' pot and the other in the 'not my vote' pot, then they were searched at the entrance and exit to make sure they could not game the system by bringing their own balls etc. After they left there is no way they could prove to anyone which way they voted and that was the idea. Anything else and there would be bribery or threats.

No it was not 5% higher because of volatility, it was higher because I was selling on LBC with a 5% mark-up. There is no need for volatility risk for more than an hour or so if you are careful. I've done it now 3 times, each time was for between $100 and $200 worth.

Though a popular meme, there is no actual evidence that barter economies preceded money in its current form. David Graeber has written a very interesting book exploring the idea. 
Its actually highly unlikely that any economies were ever run on barter systems, written debt obligations and community based credit networks where people simply recorded who owed who and how much of a particular commodity are a far more likely to have evolved as a response to the problem of the distribution of labour in society.
For many years university level textbooks have been full of misinformation about money, its history and how it functions in society today. Even the vast majority of bankers and politicians were taught wrong in their school years.

No, price will be fairly stable right up until the halving, and there will be no mass exodus of miners after block 420000. What miners do drop out will have their hashpower replaced by those bringing more efficient machines online. Some weeks after the halving price will start another rally in which fomo will take over, however it will still stumble as it approaches $1000 and settle around $600 some weeks later.

It doesn't improve size or privacy for any transactions that are currently being used on the network. 
I've yet to find anyone that has a use case in mind that will benefit from it.  
Its a bit odd to say it reduces the size of smart contracts when actually there are no smart contracts of the type that can make use of this being used today. More accurate would be to say, that the future complex smart contracts that might one day be used on the network can now be smaller in size than they otherwise would have been. If someone has an actual use case for these types of smart contracts.

I'd be surprised if that were true, for each transfer of money from UK to USA circle needs to transfer money between it's UK and USA bank accounts. Yes it will probably be able to sum everything and only send the net difference but it won't be able to continually maintain a forward balance to be netted because eventually it will run out of liquidity. Since it operates bitcoin buy and sell operations on both sides of the pond and since the regulator's will want to thoroughly audit the operation I suspect they will do the simplest thing to solve all problems which is to send the funds over the bitcoin network proper. 
Also if they were just dealing with IOUs there is no great barrier and many companies would have been offering this service already. The fact that it's zero fees means they have been able to circumvent allot of the costs of regulation, I suspect they've done that with the transparency of the block chain negating the need for such thorough and regular audits that a closed ledger would require.

Second was the the first congressional hearings in america exploring bitcoin were held and published on YouTube, most early bitcoiners expected that the hearings would paint bitcoin negatively but since they were largely positive the sentiment at the time was that bitcoin was now on the verge of institutional acceptance and mainstream with blessings of the powers that be.

I think you just had incorrect expectations, stores being closed is not the fault or responsibility of the open bazaar protocol. Also a store directory is not really open bazaar either. Yes there is a rudimentary search but over time if the protocol takes off there will need to be many external open bazaar search tools and not one single centralised one.
Try using one of the stores that is open to go through the purchase process, with and without a third party moderator, try buying both a digital good and a physical one. Your experience of that would be valid criticism of the open bazaar protocol.

If your suggesting that this operator is in fact in the USA then it's all the more reason why people should not this service. The operation is in fact illegal and therefore risks having customer funds confiscated. Those who wish to gamble should use operators who are not breaking the law in the jurisdictions in which they reside.
Customers who use legal gambling sites have recourse and are therefore much more likely to get a decent service.
Since bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world quite why anyone would use gambling site in a jurisdiction where it's illegal is beyond me. I notice also that there are no disclaimers to that effect on the site.

You've described a few things which could be said to be innovative and clever regarding the implementation of lightning, the basic design concept though is as old as the hills, fairly obvious in design... And responsible for the centralisation over time of the money supply in fewer and fewer wealthy hands. Exactly what we will see with bitcoin as the lightning network funnels fees towards those who can provide the most liquidity. In the real world we have leeks liked the Panama papers that can show us where the money is hidden, thanks to the anonymity and cryptography involved in the lightning network, one giant hub providing all the liquidity and slowly collecting up all the available fees will be able to easily disguise it self as a decentralised distributed network of many separate actors.
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:13:57
There's nothing innovative or clever about lightning, it's basically how banking has always worked. The only difference is that on traditional banking you have to find an route through paths built on trust ( or the trust that comes as a result of a governmental monopoly on force), with lightning it's dependant on liquidity.

No you couldn't do cross border transaction because the recipient does not have access to the UK govs internal blockchain api. The government could chose, either open access for all - which comes at a cost of not being able to prevent laundering / criminal activity and not getting able to enforce taxes. Or restricted access to it's citizens - which comes at a cost of requiring an identity database and not allowing cross border transactions.
How is the average Indian market trader going to redeem his britcoins from the bank of England? And if he can't, why would he accept them as currency? He wouldn't. Therefore it's a national only system..
Keep thinking about it and you'll realise that this is a non starter, if it had any benefit to the government they would have done it a long time ago .. There's nothing new about ecdsa and the system you describe does not require a block chain...
@_date: 2015-12-15 17:27:33
What you describe wouldn't be a challenge / competitor for bitcoin because it would not have the same features.
It would not be able to send money across borders, let alone with bitcoins speed. It would not be able to offer security of your money without depending on a third party, it would not be able to offer free market prices of transactions as such it would not be cheaper then bitcoin. It would still require a government run identity database attached to the blockchain addresses thus introducing risk of identity fraud. I could continue but hopefully you can see that what you describe is no threat to bitcoin and actually has very few benefits for a government to make it worth their time and effort. 
If the British government wanted to be the keeper of the ledger, it would simply abolish all high street banks and mandate that every citizen has an account with the Bank Of England, then it could have some fancy API to its backend for shops and individuals to submit transactions.  And yes it could make use of ECDSA to prevent fraudulent transactions but again it wouldn't do this without also maintaining its own ability to sign any transaction it likes with 'master signing key' for the purposes of reversals. catching tax dodgers etc. As such the signatures from keyholders who actually own the money arent providing anything like the same level of security and are essentially pointless.

I don't think you understand how those sites work very well. Each bid extends the time in the auction by a few seconds .. That's a necessity to ensure auctions can be extended long enough to cover the initial cost of the item to the company.
If you have a set amount of blocks available for bidding in you have no guarantee that enough bids will be placed to cover the item cost and the business could quickly bankrupt itself...
Those sites are horribly really they take advantage of the psychology of sunken costs to encourage people who think they are shopping to become gambling addicts.  It's no different to gambling so shouldn't be allowed to be referred to as an auction and should require gambling licences. I'm pretty sure in many parts of the world they do.

Because either you educated yourself on Bitcoin's original vision and design and bought into the project on that basis, or you didnt. If you did, I think you have a right to argue against it being subverted for no good reason. Micropayments of a few cents and uncensorable and almost free  / free transactions are the key areas where bitcoin trumps traditional payment systems. Without those features it has little hope of cracking developing and poorer economies, which are a necessity if it has a chance to become a global mainstream currency.

Fees go up ... Usage declines ... Price drops ... Miners panic ... Miners agree to increase block size 'just a little' as a temporary cure .. Capacity increases ... Fees go back to normal levels ...

Micro transactions down to a couple cents work fine and will continue to do so as long as the block size isn't artificially restricted. Confirmation times are what they are, and that's perfectly fine for the intended use case of bitcoin, internet cash.  There is already the possibility to use crypto tokens with claimed pegs to fiat value and it solved nothing because you still have to exchange your fiat for some crypto in the first place.  The only pegging mechanism that can actually work requires a trusted relationship with a regulated institution, which immediately limits it in many other ways.

It matters not one bit too the economics of bitcoin if it gets further subdivided. It would only happen for one of two reasons, either the value of a satoshi grows so high that they are no longer suitable for micropayments, or the fees market as replacement for block reward incentive process unworkable and we subdivide further to enable the reward halving to continue after 2140. Either way there is zero reason for anyone to complain about further subdivisions of bitcoin.

I doubt Satoshi would have left the fate of his 800k + bitcoins to a team of core developers no matter how well he trusted them.  He had written a lot about bitcoins ability to scale before he left and I doubt he would have much more to add. I suspect he left once he was confident the incentives were aligned such that the free market would take care of the rest... Which it will. 
@_date: 2015-12-31 11:49:22
You're just talking nonsense, of course that's how it works. I know that not every new user will run a full node but if you expand the user base a small percentage of the new users will.  If you stagnate or decrease the new users because of high fees or long delays then off course your won't get more nodes. I would expect maybe 1 in 50 users run full nodes.
@_date: 2015-12-30 19:07:36
Exactly .. That the developers of Core are trying to twist bitcoin into something other than what it was designed to be is a huge cause for concern, but only because of Cores prevalence on the network at the moment.  
Bitcoin is useful for payments that can afford a ten minute plus delay to settle .. Which sadly means it can't replace cash in retail environments. 
@_date: 2015-12-15 11:59:51
Fill deployment across the entire ecosystem will never happen because for many there is no need or purpose for it since bitcoin works fine without it. and it potentially distorts the incentive structure of bitcoin itself, for others they live in a country whose regulators are barely OK with bitcoin and will insist on throughout vetting and licencing anyone who uses their money as liquidity to facilitate the moving of anyone else's money to the point where any hubs will either be at best unprofitable and at worst criminal.   And there is no way to 'decentralise exchanges' because of the need for the transfer of fiat.  At least not more than 'localbitcoins' has already done, and they are today's exchanges.
@_date: 2015-12-13 14:50:57

Those people that think Satoshi was acting altruistically creating bitcoin are simply naive.  There is no way Satoshi would consider $1000 per bitcoin after five years to be a opportunity to sell at a profit. Satoshi will start using his stack when they are worth at least a fraction of what he thinks they will be one day which is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.

That's the wrong question.
The right question is would a government want to do this ... The answer is no because they are still sacrificing their ability to 
- keep their money out of the hands of terrorists and criminals
- monitor citizens balances, holdings and financial activity for tax purposes
Also, you have a contradiction in your description, a system can't both be considered instant and reversible. Neither can a system be both free and managed by a central organisation that has server costs.
In short, any government implementation of a blockchain like currency would end up being so different to bitcoin that it would not be competing with bitcoin.

Its completely impossible to limit the amount of mining power any one entity can have. As such further questions about how to do it are moot.
Wallets are software, mining is a process that is done on hardware these days. There's lots of old software mining programs available though, nothing stopping anyone from running them but you wouldn't want them interfering with your wallet.
And don't worry about mining centralization, study more the theory behind bitcoin and how it works and you'll be convinced for yourself that the incentives are aligned well enough and the network is secure enough to rely on.

Seriously, I'm not trolling, I'm invested in Bitcoin and I'm really excited by it, I'm just trying to keep it real. Even though i believe there's no reason why DollarCoin network couldn't work, it doesn't negate bitcoin use as as international currency for use between governments who dont trust each other, bitcoin still wins overall. But the fact is every reason why DollarCoin network would fail that Ive heard can also be applied to bitcoin, it too by design requires that one day miners will be incentivised by transaction fees alone. Either this design is plausible in which case so is the DollarCoin Network, or it isn't, in which case bitcoin is doomed to fail in 2140. I believe it is feasible to incentivise miners with a floating tx fee which will be based on the marginal cost of running miners and that implies you could do the same thing with a premined government backed DollarCoin network.
edit, as for who mines, well anyone can, but those that certainly will are national banks, companies, citizens, anyone who would prefer to see their economy run on a secure cheap open blockchain instead of behind the closed doors of central banks and policymakers offices would have in a interest in mining it.
This isnt great for bitcoin, but its not bad either, and its great for freedom and democratic oversight of monetary policy.

No, there's no way it can be done, mac address/ip address, anything that you cant think of to identify miners can be spoofed.

This is not possible, if it were, bitcoin would never have been possible in the first place.
Also, there is no threat from firewalls to bitcoin traffic, its easy to route around or disguise your traffic.

It's possible but why would you do this ?
Bitcoin is designed to be easily sent around the world to other people via the block chain transaction mechanism. 
Doing it this way is the equivalent of opening a bank account, putting some money into it, then going through a legal process of transferring ownership of the account to a beneficiary.. You wouldn't do that, you'd just do a bank transfer...
Just get them to provide you their bitcoin address and send them a transaction.
If your motivation is because they either don't have a wallet/address then you should persuade them to set one up first, it's a lot easier telling someone how to set up a wallet and give you the address than having to explain to them the process of importing a private key ( which would have to have been encrypted to prevent the postal service being a vulnerability )

if you control the quantity in circulation then of course you can peg it to the dollar, simply have the central bank say, we will buy and sell you these at a rate of 1 per dollar. Then its pegged.

Good question, I'm amazed that after five years of bitcoin there is no ecommerce solution that is really available that doesn't rely on any third partys.
Even open bazaar is not ideal for replacing web shops until they introduce 'gateway nodes' which could be a way off and won't necessarily be comfortable to those familiar with setting up web store front ends.
As soon as it's easy to get a little server space and upload your items to a web store and recieve payments to your HD wallet in your phone, bitcoin will take off considerably faster.

Based on my understanding, which could well be flawed....GovCoin is probably inevitable, they'll be forced into it when the people realise the cost savings. Initially it would be pre-mined and issued at 1:1 with the USD, then to get the benefits of the decentralised open ledger they will have to let anyone mine it and earn transaction fees for doing so. It would bring 'all' the benefits of the blockchain tech to fiat currencies. In the process it would greatly simplify much of the administrative functions of government.  Although they would  lose alot of their current ability to control and account for the movement of funds, they could retain control over the issuance and amount in circulation.

The only way to peg a decentralised trustless cryptocurrency to a fiat currency is for an incredibly wealthy organisation to step up and offer a lifetime legally binding guarantee to always buy and sell said crypto at a fixed 1:1 ratio with said fiat.
How does bitsharesx work ?   It doesn't.  Check the charts for yourself and you'll see that there is no effective peg. Volatility has been huge.

No one would take a loan denominated purely in BTC and offer to pay back interest purely in BTC because BTC has historically risen 10-30x in value against the USD with each of the bubbles/adoption waves.
Someone taking a loan this way could find themselves paying back 10-30X more fiat value than a loan in traditional fiat currencies. Youd have to be mad/scamming to do this.
Were this a real offering they would stipulate that the currency of the loan is USD and BTC network is simply being used to facilitate transfer of USD value.  As such by loaning out you bitcoins you can not benefit from the rise/fall in value of coins over time.

Most wallet will do that, just scan the address and you'll be able to monitor that address including any transactions in that wallet. Obviously you can't spend from that address without also scanning in the private keys. This is known as a 'watch only' address.

I'm sure bitpays great, but its a third party. 
ecommerce was central to the motivation for creating bitcoin and I'm pretty sure Bitpay is not how it was intended to be.
Also, really we want to encourage merchants to not immediately converting bitcoins to fiat currencies, rather we want them using them for business costs / salaries where appropriate. For business that are keen to do that, its a shame to have to use bitpay and then withdraw the coins to their own wallet, They just want them paid straight into their wallet. Thats what bitcoins about.

There simply no way to know. Not even the nsa would have any idea. You can't count wallets because HD wallets and custodial accounts like coinbase.
Also what's a user? What about people who have used it once a few months ago and might again but currently don't hold any... 
You could look at software downloads and try to reason from that, but there's so many wallet and node implementations, it'd be a fairly useless number.
You could look at the various community forums and extrapolate from that but I'd wager there's allot of bitcoin users who don't frequent forums ever.

 its difficult to tell, It is likely though that whatever regulations they settle on finally, will be the model for regulation across lots of US states.
Regulating bitcoin is a bit like a chain in that its only as strong as its weakest link, since bitcoin is global, its likely there will be some international regulatory standardisation too.
So if the final regs really do foster innovation and create a culture of acceptance it will be massively positive for bitcoin and adoption and in turn its price will come to reflect that, but equally if they err on the side of caution and succumb to the wishes of the incumbent banking sector they could really slow adoption and in turn, slow the price rise.
Eventually though bitcoin wins, so your approach to the questions of 'when to invest', 'whats a good price'  etc depends alot on if your in it for fast easy short term profit or for the long term benefits of the technology for humanity.
Me, I'm a long term holder, not enough to care if I lose it all but enough such that in ten plus years time, It ought to serve as a nice add on to my retirement fund.

Fair enough, no, your right, moving house is not a reason to sell mining hardware, their sell price is obviously more BTC's than they expect the miners to make.
I think if you're very wealthy you should buy them and run them purely for a hobby and contribution to the network, but if youre trying to get a few btcs for long term investment then simply buying the btcs would be a better option.
To try to answer your question, you should look for as many mining calculators as you can find, there are some that allow you to forecast the difficulty increases price rises etc. Because you will never be 100% sure about what the bitcoin price is going to do you should run lots of sets of figures for every possible future scenario. Particularly you should see what the ROI looks like if difficulty continues to increase on the trend it has for the past year and also if the price continues to decline at the rate it has for the past year, If you can find a way to squeeze out a ROI in a reasonable time frame with those parametres,. maybe buy them...

I disagree with your premise, many users have a good incentive to store it even if its 'massive'.
Also its not massive, its can be fit on a flash disk that you can buy for less than $10, and that will continue to be the case as disk space gets cheaper as the blockchain grows.

Yes they could technically do it, theres lots of projects that let you issue colored coins/tokens via the block chain, there is no reason one of them couldn't be a USD token, with a promise from the FED to back it one to one with the dollar it would be use able as digital dollars.
However, its unlikely they would do that since it also increases the usefulness and value of Bitcoins blockchain, in turn increasing bitcoins price which ultimately is in competition with the USD.
More likely they would try to bootstrap their own USD blockchain, but how they would achieve the decentralisation required to make it an actual competitor to bitcoin  and not just another paypal  is another question.

Heres reasons why they would mine it.
Everyday Joes  would mine it to earn tx fees they can use to pay taxes.
Business would mine it because It takes power to conduct monetary policy out from behind closed doors and into the open. and they can earn tx fees.
Banks would mine it in a bid to secure back some lost revenue.
Also, since theres no way to constrain the geographical boundaries of this network, poorer countries governments would mine it to give them cash to spend on Exports from that country.
I don't understand why you think no-one would mine it, sure no libertarians would mine it, but we seem to be in the minority. It all the benefits of bitcoin, without the volatility. With a more democratic open implementation of monetary policy. Surely vast numbers of citizens would mine it, even if it was at a small loss in the name of maintaining a technical implementation of democracy over the money supply.
 
Basically anyone that's got large amounts of fiat currency that is concerned about it being devalued in the event that bitcoin becomes popular would have a huge incentive to mine it. Protecting their interests.
We seem to be going in circles a bit, perhaps we ought agree to disagree. I appreciate the convo, but you've not convinced me that this isn't a workable implementation of blockchain technology to fiat currencies.

For the duration of the split there would be two blockchains, coins mined pre split, would be spendable on both.
However as soon as the connection is remade, one of the blockchains becomes invalid (whichever had less mining power for the duration of the split)  For this reason, it is unlikely that any merchant would ship goods based on transactions made during a chain split.
What would actually happen is that as soon as it became apparent that a split had happened, which would be immediate to the to loss of a chunk of mining power on either side causing long delays between blocks, someone would implement a way to get the chain data across the split, since it would be in everyones interest to do so. Hence space nodes, or even a dial up / satellite connection relaying block data. All it takes is one bridge between the two half's to rectify the situation.
tl:dr Dont worry about it. Its would quickly resolve it self.

They will be forced to do it, because of the pressure from the existence of bitcoin. I dont mean to suggest they are going to be jumping for joy and patting each other on the back for digitising the dollar. They'll hate it but they either up their game or the dollar dies its that simple. They will slowly implement all of bitcoins features as they struggle to compete and the final and most valuable one, the fixed supply, will be the last one they will hate to be forced to implement it the most. That's why I suggest we will see a dollar blockchain with all the features of bitcoin but with a protocol rule that still allows them to control the supply.

It was caused by all the existing bitcoiners, who had been waiting a while for their moon rocket, hearing the US Senate hold its first hearings on bitcoin and realising that they were quite positive and open to it.

Heres another possibility because of course you are right a premine isnt the way to do it for that reason, but what about a protocol rule that enables one user, one public key, to create as much DollarCoins as they wish on the fly. That way the creation of new money is done in an open auditable fashion on the blockchain. 
I understand that DollarCoin now has features that the establishment does not want in its fiat currency, i.e open auditable money creation and uncensor-able pseudonymous transactions. I dont think well see DollarCoin  anytime soon, but if bitcoin really goes mainstream, it could be a last line of defence for national fiat currencies struggling to compete with bitcoins features.

This would provide the low fees, instant transfers, uncensorable pseudonymous accounts that we enjoy with bitcoin. Eliminating identity fraud in the process, it would also open up a new revenue stream to anyone that wanted to earn transaction fees through mining.
It wouldn't be a centralised blockchain, it's essentially a block chain identical to bitcoin except with a pre mine and a government backed exchange rate. 
No block reward, just floating tx fees to incentivise miners.
@_date: 2014-10-24 21:37:16
Yes, one of the protocol rule could be that any transactions from a certain key would have the ability to create as many new coins as they wished, which would be similar to the way they create money today except it would be auditable by the public which would mean they are more accountable.

You cant have a blockchain without a native token of some description. Bitcoins blockchain requires bitcoin, other blockchains can have other tokens.

An 'off by one' quirk/error in bitcoin core means that the genesis block reward can never be spent.
Also you cant exactly trace bitcoins back to their genesis block, imagine if I use 3 block reward transactions as inputs to a transaction with a single 75 btc output. then I use that single 75 btc input to create 75  1 btc outputs. There is no way to determine the originating block for any of those 75 outputs. Best you can do is a 1 of 3 guess.

Bitcoin will retain the decentralised mining network even after the block rewards have ended.  Why couldn't a government pre mine an altcoin, have its central bank offer a fixed and guaranteed  1:1 exchange rate with their national fiat currency and then allow anyone to mine it in exchange for tx fees?
Then you have the benefits of the blockchain, decentralised, open uncensorable, cheap etc. But applied to a fiat currency.

Neither Counterparty nor Ethereum can replace bitcoin because they are not doing the same thing.
Ethereum technically could be a platform that someone launches a currency on top of, which competes with / replaces bitcoin but Ether is not that currency.
Counterparty requires bitcoin to continue doing what it does in order to function so it technically cant replace bitcoin.
In short, nothing can really replace bitcoin at this stage, but other blockchain based currencies could be launched that also gain considerable traction, although they'd have to be different enough to serve a different/particular use case and bootstrapping them would be a challenge.

Your absolutely right in everything you say, my point is not to suggest they want this, but that they'll be forced to compete with bitcoin. 
Since it is possible to put the dollar on the block chain and offer every feature bitcoin does without giving up control over the quantity/ supply, they will be forced by the free market to do it or lose everything.
The point of pegging it to the dollar is to give people the initial feeling of security that its not going to be volatile. The peg wouldn't last long as dollars become irrelevant and the traditional format was phased out in favour of the ones on the blockchain. 
Thanks to bitcoin, they don't have a choice about 'accepting a currency they cant inflate' its here, they adapt or they lose, its simple. And they will try to adapt.. and the only path for that where they can keep some of their power is the one i described. A blockchain based dollar, identical to bitcoin in every way except a government backed exchange rate and either a premine of the entire lot, or more likely a protocol rule that lets them create and destroy coins into and out of circulation at will.

It simply cant be done, the closest thing that's possible is ripple which still requires trust in a gateway.
The main reason is that you cant 'decentralise' the fiat transfer portion of the exchange, fiat can only travel along traditional channels, which are by their nature centralised and slow. 
Imagine if every buy and sell order on stamp or bitfinex took as long as it takes to wire funds via traditional channels.
You cant protect the bitcoins with multi sig sure, but you still need a centralised account into which people can deposit and withdraw fiat currencies.
Any business that claims to be offering this is misleading their customers.

It's an interesting network that allows users to create arbitrary IOUs and trade them in a fashion similar to how bitcoins traded. These IOUs can represent anything, a pint of milk, ten hours of work etc however the company behind ripple confuse things by pitching it as a way to transfer fiat currencies, really they are IOUs of fiat currencies and as such require you to trust the issuer. Or indeed to know someone who trusts the issuer that you also trust since the ripple protocol searches through the who trusts who relationships to find a way to process any transaction through parties that trust each other but might not be able to find those trust lines themselves. Ripple the currency, which your thinking if investing in, exists for the purpose of facilitating transfers of those IOUs where no such trust lines exist, in essence it's a token exactly like bitcoin except that the entire supply (200 billion I think) was premined up front by the company and they now hold most of them. As the value rises they will sell them for expenses/profit.

One aspect of Bitcoin network protocol is that if a node repeatedly sends another node malformed data (txs / blocks etc) then that node is blacklisted and future data is ignored by the receiving node.
Using this feature you can mount an attack by cycling through tor exit nodes sending malformed data from each of them until every single tor exit node has been blacklisted by every node on bitcoin network.
Then you can run your own tor exit nodes which end up being the only place bitcoin traffic on tor can reach the rest of the bitcoin network, thus you can begin to associate the nodes within tor to their transactions data.

It doesn't enable just anyone to implement a provably fair voting system from scratch immediately, but it does allow a government to prove to its citizens that a particular vote was conducted fairly and transparently.
The difficult bit of a voting system is connecting real world identities to online voting accounts in a 1:1 fashion such that nobody is missed out and nobody has multiple votes. Since the government already has a list of its citizens it could use a blockchain to issue a token to everyone in its pre-existing voter registry. This token can then be used to cast a vote in a fair and transparent fashion such that you as a voter can be completely 100% sure that your vote was counted effectively and fairly.

Ripple requires that users trust an issuer/gateway and that gateways trust each other, by definition its about transactions rippling through networks of trust (Except for the XRP itself).

The only way to peg a decentralised trustless cryptocurrency to a fiat currency is for an wealthy organisation to step up and offer a lifetime legally binding guarantee to always buy and sell said crypto at a fixed 1:1 ratio with said fiat. This would definitely require government approval/licensing in most countries of the world.
Does your currency need to be geographically constrained to your local area? because that might be the hardest part..

Whilst the designs are great, I'm afraid there is only one way to turn this into a viable product and that is to let people add their own private keys and have them be a cold storage only product.
There is no model under which you or your trusted third party vendors generate private keys that will inspire enough trust to make people actually use these for commerce.
You mention a 'minute chance' that your key generation could be compromised.  To be frank I think your being a little naive. Its a 100% percent certainty that eventually someone in your supply chain that is involved in key generation / printing will decide to simply record the private keys and steal peoples money.
Bitcoin transactions happen on chain ... me giving you my private key to 1 bitcoin instead of using the blockchain to send 1 bitcoin to your private key is simply a terrible idea. I can see the theoretical appeal but in practice its simply not a secure way to transfer value for either party.
@_date: 2014-10-24 23:02:26
No, you miss the point, the only way govcoin can work that makes it different to a simple database is if they retain the decentralisation brought about by an open network of miners. So they have to sacrifice their ability to censor transactions or attach identification to them, but they can retain control of the issuance of coins via the protocol. That's the real power they want because that's the power to control boom and bust cycles and i suspect they'll be forced into this option when people realise it's possible.
@_date: 2016-03-22 19:48:27
No, bitcoin is decentralised by design. Even if by some circumstances it becomes temporarily true that one owner controls a majority of hashpower doesn't mean anything. For instance Satoshi had &gt;50% for a long time, various pools have at times held &gt;50% and in this moment one country has &gt;50%. To claim from this that bitcoin is centralised is a nonsensical and worthless observation.

1 ) Why wait for Google?
Build a service similar to 'Play' where app authors can upload their android apps and sell them for bitcoin.  The f-droid market would provide a good starting point for research.
2)  direct payment processing
There's lots of payment processors who covert to fiat and send to your bank etc, but Bip32 provides for exporting xpub keys.
I'm sure there a market for a site that simply let's people upload there xpub keys and then generates receiving address via a web front end/api
So people can receive their own funds direct to their trezor or mycelium wallet. Could be used for tipping or merchant services integration.
3) how about a provably fair version of madbids, where an address is published that corresponds to a product, anyone can send fund to the address and when the total value received meets or slightly exceeds the value of the product, some provably fair, weighted, random selection picks who wins the product. ( like mad bid you'd need to give the losers the opportunity to top up their bids to the full value and still receive the product), volatility could be an exciting element of shopping in this way.

Someone could reimplement all the 'trust rippling' and asset issuance functionality of the ripple payment network on a sidechain to bitcoins blockchain.
Ripple the currency as it is currently distributed, will have to stay where it is though. Then Bitcoin, at a fixed exchange rate, could take the role of ripple as the intermediary currency for when no trust lines exist.
@_date: 2015-01-22 13:48:49
Precisely my point, fiat on a block chain is not technically possible. I'll concede that if you can convince enough people that it's as good as fiat, then it is in fact as good if not better, but in that case its in no way comparable to fiat, it has counterpart risk and costs to get into and out of just like any other crypto. If it achieves critical mass then one tether USD would actually be more valuable than a regular USD because its got different properties, in what sense then is it still a USD? It's not.

Ripple the currency is a trustless decentralised currency like bitcoin (except entirely premined, and unfairly distributed hence most people dont think much of it).
The other, oft overlooked, but far more important and main part of ripple is the asset exchange that is built in. Any asset exchange requires trust in that if someone sends me a token representing ownership of something (usually an amount of Fiat currency) I have to trust the person that sent me the cryptographic token proving my ownership will actually deliver the physical asset when I ask him too. 
What ripple facilitates is the spreading of trust along social networks, anyone can set themselves up as an issuer of assets, but no one will trust them except the people that actually know their real world identity and have physical access to the person, so ripple tries to remove this problem. 
For example, Bob wants to issue an IOU onto the network representing the right to $100, to be claimed from him at anypoint in the future. Alice doesnt know bob so wont accept an IOU from him, but Alice knows Jane and Bob knows Jane. So Jane publishes the fact that she trusts BOB to the tune of $100 and Alice publishes the fact that she trusts Jane to the tune of $100. Now when Bob tries to use ripple to send Jane an IOU for $100, ripple the protocol will discover that there is a trusted route from Bob to Jane and the transfer will complete. No actual crypto-currency has been transferred, its a credit money system. However if there is no trust lines to use for the transfer the ripple protocol, falls back on ripple the currency.
BTW I don't like Ripple, some of the ideas have merit, but the implementation and initial distribution is too flawed. Its like a system that could be really good for mankind but has been corrupted at the last hurdle by greed, Not surprised Jed McCaleb left the company and rebooted it as Stellar
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:22:23
About a really ineffective and corruption prone method of voting.
Voting must be anonymous and secret and private otherwise it is corruptible. The challenge is not to make voting transparent the challenge is to make a voting system where the voter can in no way prove which way they voted to anyone after the event. This they can not sell their vote or be pressured to vote a certain way.

There is no such thing as a decentralised exchange,  because in order to exchange fiat currencies at a speed faster than the three days (minimum) it takes to wire money from one account to the other, you need a centralised account to hold it in.
The notion that you can prevent the price from dropping by stopping people selling is ridiculous and the sort of thinking that bitcoin was designed to defend against. 
Both mtgox and bitstamp will turn out to be compromises from within and Stamp handled the matter very well.
Bottom line is that your annoyed cause the price is dropping, which suggests you've invested more than you can afford to.
Bitcoin will continue to have long and pronounced downtrends interspersed with the occasional dramatic run up and periods of stability.

"Once it gets bootstrapped, there are so many applications if you could effortlessly pay a few cents to a website as easily as dropping coins in a vending machine." - Satoshi Nakamoto circa 2009
Up until very recently I've been able to send these sorts of payments without a hitch and with fees that still are palatable considering the size of the payment. So unless there is going to be a radical change in the design of the system, away from what has worked exactly according to plan until now, like perhaps an artificially limited block size, then there is no reason bitcoin can't be useful for 'few cents' payments for both internet commerce and developing economies. In fact it is a huge part of its appeal since it's the one area existing payment methods can not do.

@_date: 2015-01-17 13:09:50
Yes,  in a sense, the launch and successful initial distribution of a new type of money is very much like a pyramid scheme in that early adopters get wealthy of the back of latecomers.
Yes they are selling at their profit, but why do you say it is  'at the expense' of everyone else  ? and 'destabilizing the market' ?
Like it or lump it, because when that new money removes as much corruption and levels the playing field as much as open distributed ledgers like bitcoin can, its inevitable that it'll take off. 
This analogy could also be made about gold, or oil, or any number of things for which there is limited supply and use cases which are being continually discovered.
The difference to an actual pyramid scheme though is that in those, the very top man, stays the same and the system is guaranteed to eventually collapse, not so with bitcoin or similar scarce useful resources.

Actually credit money is far better if only the credit reference function could be decentralised and globalised effectively.
Then everyone can simply issue their own debt obligations, and those can circulate as money.
The combined credit worthiness of the economic actors then is equivalent to the money supply ensuring that no inflation or deflation occurs. New money is a reflection of a peer reviewed promise of future labour, thus the economy grows in line with the output of the populations productivity.
Bitcoin is the best possibly design for a commodity money but, as we are still seeing, any type of commodity money suffers from a problem of huge volatility and difficulties getting past the initial circulation/distribution phase.

I haven't looked at the code but according to other discussions I've read,  it does pretty much everything that core does and claims to be far more efficient in many ways including initial sync and subsequent resource requirements. Only caveat is that in order that there can be no chance of any forking bugs, it does not mine.
@_date: 2016-03-21 23:49:02
Miners don't have to broadcast their own transactions to other miners, they can just generate loads of transactions with or without fees and keep them secret until they mine a block that contains them, In this way miners can fill blocks up at no expense to themselves other than the  orphan risk of transmitting a block full of transactions that have not been properly broadcast to the network.

When multi sig was getting more attention, Andreas and others espoused the benefits of a free market in arbitration/dispute resolution that would arise naturally as consumers insisted on some protection.
I'm not sure why this isn't happening yet, but when it does, those third party signatories /escrow providers/  arbitration companies will provide the reversibility needed for certain types of transactions.
Seems like it should be the payment processors and merchant services companies that to this out, or at least encourage third parties to do so via their their platforms.

Splendid idea but it doesn't really work on a technical level I'm afraid.

The idea is that channels connect up to form a connected network of channels. Then you only need find a route through it to your intended recipient. However this routing is one of the most controversial aspects of LN and, as far as I am aware, no one has quite figured out how to do it in a way that doesn't cause the network to centralise over time into a model with fewer and fewer hub nodes facilitating many connections. 
It's a similar problem to evenly distributing bandwidth provisions in a mesh network.

Good post but 'fact' 2 is kinda wrong.
Bitcoin is not free to run, true, but as people find it to be useful that gives it value and that value, through the block reward is what pays for bitcoin .. not fees.  
Well obviously that only stands until the fiat value of the block reward diminishes then the fiat value of the total fees must substitute the block reward to incentivise miners. However this does not mean that the fee for a given transaction should increase as the block reward diminishes, rather the number of transactions paying the same tiny fees they always paid should be the way of increasing the fees total.. At least that was the original idea.
I can't see any reason why it shouldn't work that way so long as bitcoin continues to grow in usefulness to more and more people, and the block chain can accommodate more and more transactions.
@_date: 2016-01-05 17:01:46

Perhaps you should look into leveraged trading. I don't know much about it and certainly don't do it as a profit making exercise but I've read that some people consider it a means of protecting your own coins from exchange hacks etc whilst still getting the benefit of being able to trade the whole balance of what you own.
For example if you own 10 coins, keep 9 in cold storage and trade 1 on 10x leverage whenever you need too.

Its useless to discuss 'Mining Centralisation' since mining is anonymous by design, there's no way to measure the number of mining hardware owners. So there's no way to measure the 'centralisation' . Hash rate distribution between pools is certainly not an indicator of 'centralisation' as claimed by many.
And why are you worried about the long term number of miners ? The system also self corrects for this ... no ?     If it gets so that you can 51% the network with a small amount of hardware then it also means you can profit from mining again with even less hardware, therefore rational actors will always mine rather than try to 51% it...

For the same reason that banks apparently want 'permissioned blockchains'. Speed, efficiency, transparency and the 99% of transactions that can now be done without a third party mediator.  I don't think any one ever suggested that we throw the entire legal system out of the window. Besides, in my example look how easy and irrefutable is my proof that I was victim of a transaction reversal attack. Not only is the proof that the blockchain provides me with sufficient to prove beyond doubt that I am the rightful owner of Apple Inc, but it also provides proof beyond doubt of who it was that tried to scam me. 
What Tim says is largely nonsense, first he was championing private, permissioned blockchains as superior to public ones like bitcoin, when really they simply serve two very different purposes, and now he thinks banks want too put their trading/settlement systems beyond legal recourse... Not gonna happen is it.  To be honest I'd be very surprised if that were true, there's lots of benefits for them using private blockchains but final irreversible settlement without recourse can't be one of them, surely ....

I much prefer bitcoin too because it's incentive structure is such that nobody can manipulate the money supply to their own advantage just by having a lot of it.

I understand perfectly how this works. All you've done is point out that these days most cold wallets are multisig, that's true but you can't possibly know that this wasnt a cold wallet just  because it may not have required multiple signatures. Cold non multi sig wallets may not be best practice for an exchange but it doesn't mean they don't exist.

This is a classic example of my point above, you don't believe that bitcoin will be valuable or play a large part in the global economy. As such you believe it necessary to find a solution for decreasing block reward at this stage. This demonstrates a technical mindset with little thought for the interplay with economics that is so central to bitcoins design.
There is no need to find a solution for decreasing block rewards because they won't decrease for at least 100 years! Possibly never ... The Btc value yes, but the fiat value No ... so long as the network is allowed to grow. 
The only reason we need to worry about decreasing block rewards is in the event that the growth of the network is stunted by failure to increase the block size.

Its true that every user requires at least one actual on chain bitcoin transaction to open a LN channel and another to close it.  So a cap on Block Size is a cap on users even with LN.

I don't know how you arrived at your understanding but it is a radical departure from the understanding of the designer of the system...
Why on earth would full blocks be necessary for a healthy network ?
As for network effect ... hard forking may split the network assuming there are participants who are inclined to throw their money away by trying to mine a minority fork instead of a more valuable majority fork that the economy prefers. Those people are welcome to try to continue their own dysfunctional chain if they wish. However the far greater loss of network effects is that lost by not allowing the user base to grow as a result of capped block sizes.

Im a smart guy, but i have no idea how this relates to my question ...
To me it seems completely obvious that what makes litecoin litecoin and not bitcoin is that it started with a different genesis block, uses a different hashing algo and has a different blockchain. In fact if the users of bitcoin wanted to make bitcoin litecoin, I dont believe there is any way they could do it .....
So forgive me if I don't think your answer explains anything at all ... ill ask again .. What can I do as a user to enforce the rules of bitcoin ? 
@_date: 2017-03-17 06:50:24
How do you know that he didn't mean that?
LN threatens to centralise the money supply into a few hands and seriously corrupt the balance of incentives behind bitcoin, let alone the fact that unless block sizes are raised in accordance with the number of users, those users will still not ave access to micropayments because of the prohibitive cost of opening and closing channels. 
The question is not 'how large would blocks have to be ?' the question is 'could the networks requirements be handled by the hardware and bandwidth available to average users ?' and so long as we dont grow faster than disk space and internet speeds  then yes there is no reason why all the worlds transactions couldnt go on chain.. These calculations were worked through as part of the first discussions Satoshi had after release his paper. 
There is nothing wrong with a confirmation time of 10 minutes, even an hour except for merchant use..
What was Satoshi wrong about  ?

Well probably people either didn't have much value at stake or didn't think about it but I suspect if an exchange refused to allow me to withdraw the coins onto the chain I used to deposit them because they agreed with a controversial fork and I didn't I would certainly sue and I fail to see how that case would be easily decided, it's an interesting legal question that's  all I'm saying...

That was my point - that it's decentralised by design even if not in a practical sense 100% of the time.
However, because it will always be decentralised by design, those times when's it is centralised in practice are not permanent.   Just because there may be periods when holders of hashpower/development influence/large numbers of nodes is centralised, only means that bitcoin has become temperately centralised, until those actors start abusing their power.

Nobody really has to pay that.  That's paid for out the value created by the usefulness of bitcoin. Deducted at source by the network itself.

You havent thought this through, and i dont think you understand the intricacies of international politics and economics at all. 
A government would never permit, and can never work with a 'GovCoin' as you describe it for the simple reasons that governments need to be able control the monetary policy of their country, that is to say they need to be able to add and subtract from the money supply as and when their current economic situation demands it. Also they can not permit a currency for which they have no control over its boundaries. The GovCOin you describe has so few similarities to Bitcoin that when it is released people will instantly recognise it as something entirely different from Bitcoin and there is no way it will be able to take bitcoins place in the market for currencys. Its like saying the government is going to replace all the worlds ketchup with apple sauce and people are going to continue happily putting it on their fries.
@_date: 2016-01-16 14:19:55
They don't have, nor did they ever have control. neither does anyone else. That's as it should be. Once that fact is finally established through diversification of development, multiple competing implementations and the economic majority repeatedly winning out, bitcoin the protocol will finally have laid to rest the idea of 'control' by anyone. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 03:15:00
I see what youre getting at , but what your really saying is that individual users can affect the rules of bitcoin as far as their own vantage point is concerned. That's obvious, I can make anything in the world be anything if i'm content with having only myself as the arbitrator of what is what.  
Thats not me affecting the rules of bitcoin, thats me affecting the rules of my local copy of bitcoin.  
Let me rephrase my question with more accuracy, How can I as a user enforce the rules of bitcoin for the benefit of other people ?
As a miner I can enforce the rules for the benefit of other people by only mining blocks which conform to the rules that the majority of the users are happy to accept, I can get feedback from users as to what they are happy to accept through price movements and by mining blocks and seeing if others mine on top of them... No such mechanism exists for users to enforce rules for anyone but themselves. 
Is there a way for me to enforce the rules of bitcoin on other people? Other than mining ?
edit - and honestly I dont thnk enforce is really the right word to use, if you're only 'enforcing' on yourself. 'Accepting' is far more appropriate dont you think ?
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:04:57
Satoshi never intended block size to be one of the consensus rules.
@_date: 2016-01-19 12:36:15
If only 49% of hashing remains on minority chain then the blocks interval becomes around 20 minutes, main chain blocks also go slower but it grows faster that losing chain. For miners to decide to stop working in longest chain and decide to support the slow chain that is now many blocks behind they have to be willing to give up a lot of money in block rewards based on a very unlikely chance that they will be able to catch up and overtake main chain.  The more time that passed since the split the less likely it becomes that they can possibly achieve that, hence why forks resolve themselves very fast, miners must decide very quickly which side they support our risking losing alot of money. After losing chain is 6-7 blocks behind chance of catching up is minuscule. That's why we say for high value payments even in the millions of dollars need only wait 6 blocks because after that the chance of a forked chain catching main is practically nothing.
This is all well described in the original white paper, have you read it?
@_date: 2016-01-16 14:37:34
That's just nonsense .. If classic wins a majority it will prove that no one can control bitcoin except the wishes of the economic majority. If any implementation goes against the wishes of the user base they get ousted.

What your witnessing is not bitcoin supporters falling out and disagreeing, it's the push back from existing money powers who've infiltrated the debate.

But the government wouldnt be so stupid as to spend so much time or money on trying to control all the hardware, there is no way they can ever predict if such a venture would be successfull, and if it is not successfull it would have the opposite of its desired effect, even if it was successfull it would only be a temporary success. Whichever way you look at it, they will only end up strengthening bitcoin in the end and making it more difficult to control it on the long term.  This is the result of the incentives and was what satoshi mean when he said 'any adversary would be better off contributing to the network than trying to control it.
@_date: 2017-03-17 02:12:46
Its not all about technical arguments though is it .. 
I dont know if this is the reason but if I were a miner I would be very hesitant about enabling lightning networks for fear of losing fee income to liquidity providing hubs.  Also, until someone can demonstrate how lightning networks wont centralise the money supply into the hands of large liquidity providers Id be very reluctant to faciliate it. Also there is the issue and very real danger that users who may be priced out of their settlement transactions and may turn to other arbitration methods amongst themselves rather than the blockchain making th miners essentially irrelevant. The idea that lightning networks will solve scalability is hugely optimistic and there are plenty reasons to be concerned  that they actually could facilitate the demise of bitcoin as we know it today altogether. 
If I were a miner I certainly wouldn't activate segwit for those reasons.
@_date: 2016-01-16 14:42:18

Wording wasn't the greatest 'farm operators' I took to mean pool operators rather than hardware owners.
The 'value' added to a coloured coin doesn't rely on the security of the blockchain though.  If I bought a satoshi that was coloured with complete ownership of all Apple Inc shares and was subsequently victim to a reorg attack that reversed the transaction I'd simply use the existing legal system to regain my property, providing irrefutable proof of exactly what happened would be dead easy.
@_date: 2017-03-09 22:52:47
First question that springs to mind ...
How can a miner be sure that switching their hashpower back to the minority chain will result in that chain becoming the majority chain .... Even if they have sufficient hashpower to make the difference at the time they intend to change they better not be far behind in terms of work because if they are, there is time for the balance of hashpower to change again resulting in a failed attack and a lot of lost revenue.  The further behind they are, the less likely it is that they will be successful.  Seems fairly obvious that a profit motivated miner would not take the risk considering the damage even a successful attack of this stuff would do the value of all coins involved and by extension, their hardware.
@_date: 2016-03-24 14:45:26
Localbitcoins, bittylicious in UK, bitsquare ...  All example of platforms where the fiat is sent directly from user to user instead of going through an exchanges holding account. However this is slow and has trust issues, as a result no p2p exchange can ever operate a live, fast order book like you see at bitstamp et al. To answer your question .. We have them and they're not all that. The reason is simply that moving fiat money is slow and requires third parties.

No it's not a problem if you don't mind living in a world where one person has 99.9% of all the money in circulation. But it's not exactly the decentralised fair economic system that bitcoin originally promised. In fact I'd prefer the current system where at least monetary sovereignty is held by the heads of state of multiple competing nations. I'm well aware of the almost infinite divisibility of bitcoin. And you may not think this would happen but I think, looking at the game theory and economic side of lightning network that's it's inevitable that that is where it would lead us.

That hard fork is clearly not the same situation miners were mining a bad chain in error of course when they ask discover it they switch en masse .. Have you checked the actual numbers on 6 blocks??  Never mind what Gavin says it's the math that matters. But even 120 blocks is only a days mining so even if the numbers weren't so astronomically minuscule any fork would be unbeatable within a day.
@_date: 2016-01-17 13:43:36
Mining fees are totally different thing because they first require an investment from money that comes from out side the bitcoin economy. Thus they grow the bitcoin economy by drawing in more value.
I wish I could find a way to prove myself wrong but it seems to me that if I can earn fees from a global market without any risk to my own coins of course I'll do it. Everyone will ... So lightning fees will be rock bottom in accordance with expected results of a free market in fees .. However Satoshi with his million coin stash can earn more than anyone else and undercut everyone else and offer channels the cheapest so obviously will win all the business and as a result will only grow his stash and in turn be able to provide more channels in a self reinforcing cycle. No? 
Worse still he could do it completely anonymously and create the illusion that he is multiple competing entities.

I'm neither a paid shill, vote brigader or a member of a mining cartel. Simply a guy who got into bitcoin off the back of a news report in 2013, quickly became fascinated by its potential impact on the world and it's inner workings. Like many here I spent months reading and researching until I really understood it and then took a large proportion of my savings and converted them to bitcoin. 
I've followed both sides of the block size debate with continued frustration and am off the opinion that hard forks to increase the block size should take place every few years such that we never have consistently full blocks. 
I've still not heard any decent reason from those who oppose such a plan to why that would be a bad idea but I do find that when evaluating their arguments they usually tend not to believe that bitcoin will ever be hugely valuable or grow to play a major part in the world's economy. 
@_date: 2017-03-29 09:41:10
Nodes accept or reject consensus on an individual level and decide whether to comply with it. Mining nodes create consensus by appending blocks to the most work chain.
The claim that somehow the cumulative power of the 'economic' nodes is combined to 'enforce' consensus on the mining nodes is simply wishful thinking. Non mining nodes can consider anything they like valid or invalid according to their own preferences and follow branches of chains accordingly but if their branch suddenly died or stops because the majority of miners are doing something else then they will be 'defining consensus' on a stump as opposed to a chain.

Your quite correct, that is how it would go eventually but I was thinking about that interim period while the fork is still unresolved ... During that brief period the exchange that doesn't allow customers to use both sides if the fork is on very shaky legal ground.
In fact I could argue that I had intended to withdraw my coins on the small block side of the fork and then spend them on mining equipment which, if many people did the same could have even prevented the large block side of the fork from eventually winning out ..

Do you know how pools work ? IP Proxys ? Networks ?
The vast majority of the IP addresses you see transmitting blocks are not miners.  Any miners that wants to hide behind TOR can do so. Any miner that wants to connect to a pool via a VPN can do so. Just because you see a node transmitting a block and its the first node you see on the network to do so ... doesnt mean the block originated at that node. There is no way to be 100% ure about the originating IP of a block without monitoring the entire internet and even that would be easy to circumvent if I wanted to mine anonymously.
There is zero connection behind IP address and miners. 
Mining is anonymous, by its nature.

That would be a separate kind of attack. This attack is simply brute forcing random private keys find ones with funds on. The safety of using a new address each time comes from decreasing your susceptibility to an attack against ECDSA from a quantum computer that is able to derive keys from the public one that are necessarily published when you sign a transaction with them.

Big blocks also can boost utility which in turn boosts price which in turn attracts more miners.
Big companies for example, when they are confident bitcoin can scale to meet their needs they might get involved. Since they like control they'll possibly run some mining hardware, even if it's at loss because at least then they are progressing their own transactions and have some access to fresh clean coins. But they won't participate in this way if bitcoin is restricted to a few million users.

1. For storage, learn about cold storage paper wallets, try to make a few, redeem a few and when you understand how to operate them, consider them as an option for your long term  cold storage.
2. Don't dismiss mining completely but do ALOT of research to understand what you're getting into. Many people will tell you you 'cant make money' or its not worth it but in truth every existing miner is incentivized to prevent more competition in the mining marketplace. Its possible that it looks like you wont make money but as you have seen recently, bitcoin price can rally at any time and it might push previously unprofitable miners into the profit.
3. Sell products or services in exchange for bitcoins, there is OpenBazaar plus various bitcoin Jobs boards. Google will help you here.

Very few points of contention but one large error in the mining article - "While mining was quite easy in 2009, the Bitcoin protocol is designed to make it increasingly difficult as more bitcoin are generated."
This is incorrect, the bitcoin protocol is designed to make it increasingly more difficult as more miners come on board and more easy as more miners leave.  This has the effect of ensuring that fluctuations in the amount of miners on the network doesn't affect the speed at which the blocks are generated. Which ensure that bitcoins are produced at the rate which was decided at the definition of the protocol.

Because when it was $900 the blocks weren't full.
The problem now is blocks are full and many people think that with full blocks, the main reasons people have for using bitcoin (cheap and fast) are becoming less reliable. As a result it loses utility and this is reflected in price.
That price is currently increasing doesn't mean this is not happening, is perfectly possible price would have increased a long time ago and be much higher today were it not for peoples doubt about the future.

The old adage 'buy the rumour, sell the news'. Lots of people with a little cash on the side know that people expect the bitcoin halving to cause a rise, so they buy in advance and cash out when the halving comes. I'm expecting a 10-15% drop immediately after the halving which will quickly pick up again in the days after. For my strategy, I'm coming all out in a few days time before the halving and getting back in afterwards. Also this means that you are not stuck on chain in the (admittedly unlikely) event that a big drop off in miners causes the worst congestion the network has seen to date.

Honestly in times of high volatility like now buying is more risky than in times where the price hasnt moved for ages. Buying now you can be assured of one thing, your bitcoins will either gain or lose value in the very short term.
Really you should research bitcoin more before investing any substantial amount of money. if you come to really understand it you will probably agree with something that bitcoins creator said in the very beginning which is that one day bitcoins will either be worth ALOT or NOTHING. That means in the 10,000 - 100,000 range or zero, within the next few decades. However that doesn't mean that when price goes up fast it wont ever come back down again.  I first bought bitcoins half way up the 2013 rally and spent 2 years watching them lose value ... until two weeks ago.
@_date: 2016-06-22 13:08:48
The point is that the status of 'currently being on the network' is decided by whether or not it exists in anybody's mempool. Because there is not one central mempool it is entirely correct to ask the questions about what do you mean by 'on the network'. 
Some peoples mempools can be configured to store everything unconfirmed forever and other peoples mempools can be configured so that if a transaction doesn't make it into the first block, it is dropped from their mempool.
That's why the question of 'What transactions exist on the network that are currently unconfirmed ?' really doesn't make sense. You cant say that one transaction is 'on the network' if it exists in multiple mempools because you have no way to know how many mempools a particular transaction is in.  How can a transaction not be considered to be 'on the network' if it does exist in at least one nodes mempool. You seem to be claiming that if a transaction exists in the majority of mempools then it somehow has  different status to transactions that exists in perhaps only one or two nodes mempools. Thats not a distinction thats useful because you cant know how much of the total nodes mempools a transaction exists in..
@_date: 2016-06-14 15:15:31
Its not obvious at all that the price will increase post halving, its quite possible that the pre-halving increase we are now seeing will over shoot and we will see a decline post halving that brings us back to a fair market value with the reduced inflation priced in. This is what happened with Litecoins last halving. Bear in mind the old saying about speculation 'Buy the rumour, sell the news'. 
I'm predicting a decline starting quite steeply about a week before the halving and continuing but more shallow for the couple of weeks after the halving back down to about 500 USD which will provide some support, then in the coming 6 months a slightly rocky ride back up to around 650.

There is no good reason to believe that large blocks encourage centralisation, all arguments that support that tend to overlook the fact that larger blocks will lead to increased price and that will lead to more new miners entering the competition.

Also Whilst I agree that the world economy is totally corrupt I'm not sure its going to completely collapse for that same reason.

Name one such miner ..because i suspect that no miners were in the least bit phased by a few nodes wanting to fork themselves off the network and leaving themselves with a dysfunctional chain.

We should encourage developers to at least take the tiniest step toward a compromise on block size after years of attempted concessions by the sizeable portion of the user base who invested in Bitcoin based on the idea that it would scale according to its original design. ( And who are completely unconvinced as to the arguments presented by those who would steer it away from that course as to why it cannot). Since core have utterly failed to take into account what a large proportion of the users, miners and business actually using bitcoin want, is now time for that large proportion of users to take responsibility for their own money and go their own way. Forgive them if they don't now feel like making concessions for those who want to stay behind.

This is not about waking up, decentralised vs centralised exchanges offer different feature sets. Since bitcoin began people have been using exchanges like bitstamp which provide an order book and fast trades but carry third party risk and also localbitcoins which is a kind of first (and partially centralise) attempt at decentralised exchange.
Bitsquare is a truly decentralised exchange but many readers will still always prefer the speed of execution that a centralised offers that cannot be done in a decentralised way due to the inherent slowness of transferring fiat over traditional wires.

Easy first transfer your 2x coins to yourself to yourself using a fee level that means it won't be confirmed on the legacy chain for at least a few more blocks after the 2x chain. Then once you're 2x coins are secured you can send your legacy coins to who ever you want using a transaction fee that will confirm faster.
Worst case scenario is that you have to try this a couple of time before it works.

This is another way to increase the fee associated with a transaction after it has been initially broadcast. Whereas Replace by Fee allows the original sender to replace the original transaction with one with a higher fee. Child Pays For Parent allows the recipient of as yet unconfirmed transaction 'x' to create another transaction 'y'.  Y spends the output from X to a new address but includes a higher fee.  The higher fee from Y will now influence transaction selection to effect a faster confirmation time for both X, and Y.

I don't know why you think it's too early, it seems completely obvious that the network effects inherent in providing liquidity for channels will cause hubs to form and consolidate over time. Worse is that the fees earned by such hubs will facilitate them to open yet more channels with yet more liquidity, this is a self reinforcing network effects that not only will centralise the movement of money through fewer and fewer hands but also threatens to eventually centralise the supply of existing bitcoin itself into those same hands. 
The only thing that gives me any hope for the future of bitcoin is that it seems the miners know better than to activate segwit / facilitate Lightning networks and also of course that Satoshi still has a stash large enough that at least someone other than the existing monetary powers in the world will end up in control of the biggest lightning hubs.
The prudent thing would be to allow the network to grow as originally intended such that the increase in block space will facilitate more users which in turn will boost price and encourage more miners to join the competition enhancing decentralisation.

No its not, even if you personally refuse to accept the chain that the miners switch to is still called Bitcoin, many people will consider it Bitcoin. Also, labelling issues aside, if all the mining power defects to another consensus ruleset it will absolutely affect the original network on the original consensu ruleset because either it will have no miners and therefor a unusable chain or it will have to hardfork to a different consensus ruleset to facilitate the continuance of the chain, thus becoming something other than Bitcoin according to its own (rather useless and lame) definition of what is actually Bitcoin, namely whatever network follows a certain consensus ruleset (as defined by the current core dev team).

In the event of a split one coin would quickly die, Ethereum is fundamentally different to bitcoin, those differences allowed a minority chain to survive. That would not be the case with bitcoin.  To maintain a minority fork of bitcoin it would be necessary to change the difficulty level and the mining algorithm, such changes even would probably not be enough to maintain the forks value in the face of the economic pressure from the majority chain. After all those changes there is no question about what is and what isn't bitcoin proper, the only remaining question is why anyone would be foolish enough to try to fork without majority economic support and mining hash power combined as opposed to simply start an new alt coin, which at least has a tiny chance of life.

You make a point of difficulty increases potentially lengthening the break even time but make no mention of the possibility that bitcoin price rises could potentially shorten the break even time, why?
OP it's important to do your own research, mining is not guaranteed profit and will always be a gamble because it depends mostly on the price of bitcoin, which no one can predict.

It doesn't enable them to find blocks faster, that's not what I said. It enables them to start working on finding the next block faster. That's a subtle but crucial difference. The time it actually takes to find a block is completely random. Of course validationless mining costs the miner because they aren't able to pickup any of the available fees but better that than spending the electricity on blocks that will be rejected because either they lose the race or contain transactions that were already confirmed.

It's possible that some miners believe enabling lightning networks are a bad idea.

No it doesnt. Starting work in the next block sooner doesn't mean that you will find the next block sooner because finding blocks happens in a random amount of time.

@_date: 2016-12-15 16:50:34
No, the previous poster is correct, there is a lot of history around the topic of validationless mining including input from various developers if you care to search to really understand the issue. Miners mine empty blocks because the fastest way for them to know that a block has been found by a competing pool is by connecting to that pool directly and pretending to be a miner for that pool. That way when ever that pool finds a block it instantly updates all it's miners with a new block header to work on. The secretly connected competing miner now knows that it is wasting work by continuing to search for a block at the same height, even though it hasn't yet received that block via the p2p network (which is slower than the direct connection it has made to the pool) Note the miner can begin to search for the next block because it has the header but it cannot verify what transactions were included in the recently found block because when a pool distributes new work to its miners it only sends them the block header as opposed to the full block. This means that although the miner can start to build a new block based on the header of the recently found one it cannot know which of the transactions it has in its memory pool have been included therefore the only safe thing for it to do in the short time period before it recieves the full block via the p2p network is to mine blocks with no transactions in them. This is known a validationless mining and is a common well understood occurrence on the network. It benefits miners with a slower connection and anything that is both available to all miners and helps them mine ought be considered beneficial to the network. Actually it doesn't even reduce capacity because blocks are not a finite quantity and the chance of finding one is essentially random. Had the miner included transactions he wouldn't have found the block, hence nothing is lost.
@_date: 2016-12-15 18:25:19
The timestamps of blocks are not accurate, (which is the reason why the block chain was invented in the first place. There is no central clock that you can rely on for reporting the order of transactions or blocks) There is no reason to mine empty blocks except the one I explained above therefore the only reasonable conclusion is that they are doing it for that reason.
@_date: 2016-12-24 16:08:15
I don't think you understand my comment. A minority chain would be clearly and unarguably dead because it's chain would have stopped being appended by new blocks. No more mining would be taking place because before any more blocks could be found a hard fork would need to happen to change the difficulty of the minority chain, such a hard fork would be impossible to code test and release in a timely fashion to say nothing the process of trying to achieve consensus on what the hard fork should contain, even if it was limited to a simple difficulty change, at what value should the new difficulty be set? This would be a question as difficult to come to consensus on as bitcoins block size has been. Main chain miners would have a financial interest in poisoning the discussion and if the number ends up being too low the chain can easily be attacked, to high and it doesn't achieve its desired result. These are just a handfuls of the challenges facing a minority fork of bitcoin, whilst all this is happening the would be minority chain miners are literally throwing money away every ten minutes by not simply switching back to the majority winning chain, the profit motive is clearly strong with miners or they wouldn't be doing it in the first place, you really think a minority chain can survive?

Interesting.. Thanks, I thought miners could mine in a way that ensures no one could identify their blocks with a little care, are you sure this is not possible and someone else would identify them??
And I hadn't considered it before but I suppose you may well be correct that until the harmful effects of limiting block size are clearly filtering through to price, miners might be foolish enough to believe it's in their interest to aim to boost fees over enhancing price through network growth.
On reflection I guess you must be right, attributing this many small blockists to entrenched interests in the incumbent financial system is probably giving them to much credit and there's nowhere else they could be coming from except the mining community.
 I can't see any benefit in the ability to identify benign centralisation though.

Think it through, there are no costs to providing liquidity, yes the free market will drive down profits to the minimum, but he who has the most coin will, without any risk to his coin, be able to under cut his competing hubs. Since payers are going to naturally select the cheapest channel ( probably a function of the software) over time the inevitable conclusion is that LN will eventually become one hub with many many spokes.
Combined with the the issue of miners becoming hubs and or hubs becoming miners, you have a huge deviation from bitcoins original well balanced incentive structure into one that favours the wealthy and inevitably results in a centralised network.
@_date: 2015-08-07 18:36:17
It wouldn't matter one bit if 50% of miners dropped out, the network will always be decentralised, even if, like what happened a while ago one miner controls &gt;50% of hash rate, it will only be temporary, network was fine last time and will be fine next time. As for 'legislated tax' if you chose to look at it like that, thats up to you but it's nonsensical to me.  BTW the difference between 'mining industry' and 'individual miner' is absolutelt crucial and fundamental and the correct way to think about it is 'individual miner', you're way is nonsense. The whole thing rests on mining being a collection of individuals, as you well know, and not a collective of miners.

Nothing nonsense about that, but that's not what you said.

Agreed, my reasoning for suggestion we stop identifying blocks was because it has no positive effect on anything in terms of identifying centralisation or the possibility of a mining majority attack and like you say, does bolster people who would use flawed statistics to bolster a failed argument.
 
If you also agree that miners will make more profits if the network grows it usefulness which can only happen with larger block sizes then, can you see your way to agreeing that it would be in the miners best interest to stop publishing their authorship of blocks? Since this will result in less detracters to larger blocks and therefore eventually more value in bitcoin and by extension more value in the block rewards. It's a small thing but your average potential big player could easily be put off by looking at blockchain.info/pools and reading the doom sayers posts about 'centralisation of mining' and decide that bitcoin is too immature. If we convince miners to convince pools to stop publishing their authorship, we take away a tool from the dissenters with no discernible loss to those who would see the network prosper with large blocks.
Satoshi didn't foresee mining pools as far as I can tell, his original belief was that all mining would be anonymous and there would be nothing other than the trust in the protocol rules and significant likelihood that &gt;50% of miners would be self serving to convince the user base of the decentralised nature of it. Blockchain.info/pools helps no one except propagandists.

I was with your right up until the end, why should the cumulative block reward be the amount it costs to 51% the network.
Today mining rewards are circa $828000 per day, by your logic that means you can 51% the network by spending $828K??   I don't get it..

No, I'm referring to the original spec as described by satoshi nakamotos early writing, primarily the white paper. That's what I read and bought into and the most impressive bit of it was the inclusion of the first ever direct technical implementation of a democratic system where by the rules of the network were whatever was decided by the majority and implemented through the software version they choose to run.
I'd be interested in your attempt to describe the consensus system by which bitcoin has been built thus far.
There IS clearly an overwhelming consensus of people who, like you and me support a modest block size increase imminently but it's being blocked by a few devs of one version of the bitcoin software. And now it seems the subject is being censored,  I feel ill.

It's nonsense to say bitcoin costs money to run that is being paid for by debasing existing coins because all the value those existing coins have comes from the usefulness of the network. It's true that the network pays for itself out of the value that it creates itself but that is no more a cost to users than bottle beers are a cost to a bar owner, they are an operating cost paid for from previous profits and necessary for continued profits.

Your first isn't worthy of a response other than, don't be a muppet. You know I mean the original design and not the original codebase, that's my whole point.
As to centralisation of mining, its nonsense. In reality you can't measure such a thing, you have no idea who controls what hashing power and things like blockchain.info/pools  are only serving to create the illusion that you can. It's apparently 'decentralised' enough as evidenced by the fact that there have been zero issues for which 'centralisation' could be accused of being responsible.
You have zero evidence to show that the reasons miners were not validating blocks is because 'it takes to long'. Far more likely is that they simply thought they would save on costs and cut corners because they thought they could get away with it and now some have paid the price they probably won't do that again.  That's the system working well. 
As for rapidly dropping number of nodes, that too is nonsense. It's been stable at around 6k for months if not years. Your leveraging the switch people made away from bitcoin core and onto web and mobile based wallets as evidence for this but reality is the large number is nodes bitcoin had in its early days was simply because there were no other wallet options. 6k is more than enough for now again as evidenced by the fact that my spv wallets work fine and if I want a copy of the chain I can easily get one, and my payments propagate to miners perfectly efficiently.
In short, the justifications for not having timely small increases in block size are nonsense and trying to usurp bitcoins built-in method of preventing corruption and centralisation through letting your software be your vote is under hand, unscrupulous and stinks of the old guard.
BTW lightning network will destroy bitcoin quickly yet surreptitiously, using it makes the rich get richer since the hub that has the most coin can make the most in fees, but there will be no way for you to know that the seven hubs you get to choose from are in fact all controlled by the same entity.

@_date: 2015-08-02 22:08:53
No, it's a key feature. What I mean is, you can't really accurately measure the 'centralisation' in mining, it's anonymous.  People can allocate their hashing power to multiple pools if they want. If someone wanted to intentionally subvert and centralise the network for the purpose of censoring payments there is no way we would be able to detect it until it it started happening, and by then it would be game over. You wouldn't get a heads up from   You base your valuation of bitcoin on your understanding of and level of trust in the protocol, then, unless your a miner, you forget about mining completely.
@_date: 2015-08-10 00:32:56
Before you even get to the technical side of LN, one things jumps out.
Hubs earn fees for provision of payment channels, which require liquidity. The more liquidity you can provide the more payment channels you can offer and the more fees you can earn, which in turn means have more coin to provide more liquidity to more channels.
The rich get richer, the money will, over time, centralise in the hands of the largest hub.

Yeah but if I give you a million dollars, you don't have anything like enough money to buy enough hardware to 51% the network today.  So your logic is wrong somewhere, I think it's in the fact of the hardware not being buyable for a days use only.  Therefore when there is only a satoshi per block on offer and its worth the equiv of 2.5 of today's dollars, you're no closer to being able to 51% the network with a days worth of mining rewards unless you can find someone to sell you hardware for a cost effective price that allows for the proviso that it'll only mine for a day.

If 2x wins it will be because the market favours it, no matter how much money you have, it's not enough to force millions of users to value something indefinitely.
Equally if the current consensus rules wins out it will be because the market favours it. 
The fundamental characteristics of responding to the economic forces are a consequence of the design of bitcoin.
If you believe that only a small handful of elites and companies can force their will on the millions of users then you are rather naively suggesting that Bitcoin users are lacking greed. A quality which is found in abundance in all humans.

Lightning incentivises the worst kind of centralisation. That is centralisation of the money supply.  The bigger hub earns more fees and so can provide more liquidity/channels to earn yet more fees.

I'm not being pedantic, nothing you've explained above alleviates my concerns that who ever has the most coin can provide the cheapest routes, undercut others on fees and in turn earn more fees to strengthen their position further. Eventually resulting in a single hub with many spokes. 
Traditional mining is not the same, Who ever has the best chip design or cheapest electricity or best run of luck can get an edge temporarily, preventing the same situation in mining from occurring. Payment hubs require only bitcoin as a cost and the more you have, the more competitive you can be and therefore the more you'll get. To me it seems obvious and inevitable where this will go...

The decentralised exchange concept will never deliver what most people actually want. Traders want fast execution and so there has to be a central account, in the custody of some third party between trades, for the store of people fiat currency, without that the trades can only happen as fast as traditional bank wires can be executed which means that in countries like the UK and Eurozone it can be pretty fast, but from one country to another you cant trade in less than 3 days.. Really the best that can be created has already been created in the form of bisq exchange, it has been running for months now and still has gotten very little traction because people simply dont want to wait, they want their orders to execute fast. To be able to do a buy, then a sell later then a buy again without having to wait 3 days each time for payments to clear..

Im not in the slightest concerned about the block size issue, miners are strongly incentivised to maximise the value of their block rewards and maximum value comes from maximum utility, micropayments and low (close to zero) fee transactions are bitcoins biggest advantage over already existing payment networks so are a area of huge utility. As a result miners will earn vastly more in block reward in a blockchain with very low fees than they will from high fees of a restricted block size.  tl:dr The market will resolve the block size issue in the interests of the economic majority.

I'm not suggesting that hubs with the highest fees will be the problem.  As I said, simply the fact that more liquidity provides more fees which provides more liquidity will inevitable result in centralisation of the money supply.  If satoshi decided to use his stash to create 250ish hubs, one in every country of the world and under cut everyone else on fees soon he would have cornered the market. Over time bitcoins value would keep rising but he would have an ever increasing % of the total 21M.  Also, he could do this in a way which was undetectable, due to the anonymous nature of hubs, no?

So we agree that there is no protection/benefit from identifying blocks if you assume the attacker is malicious.
I have seen only 3 justifications for the 'small blockist' position . First is - miners are not validating because it 'takes too long', which is countered by the fact that they lose money in the event of building on an invalid block and the incentive structure will soon oust this kind of behaviour, the system working as designed. Second is 'number of nodes is rapidly in decline' which is countered by the evidence that in fact we are stable at around 6k for 18+ months and there is ample nodes for SPV wallets and propogating txs to miners works perfectly efficiently with this number of nodes. Third and most often is that larger blocks will further 'centralise mining' to which I reply, that's unmeasurable in reality and as a retort I am pointed to blockchain.info/pools and the like. The lay person with little understanding of these things would likely agree that it appears we are in danger of being subverted by collaborating Chinese miners.
In a world of identified blocks an opportunistic attacker can see they are approaching an opportunity and can take steps to hide their approaching opportunity from the community by diverting some hash power until they are ready to launch their attack. In a world of unidentified blocks they can never be sure they are approaching the threshold or simply having a run of good luck. No?
What benefits are their to identifying the authors of blocks in reality?  I think it's clear their is a detriment.
Edit- BTW thanks for you time, I appreciate the discussion.

Research the Skyhook thoroughly, It hasnt got the greatest reviews in terms of Hardware / Software or customer service. Its a shame cause it seems like the best ATM available at first glance.  I used the one they had setup at NYC Bitcoin Center once and it was slightly lacking in the ease of the UI but seemed ok otherwise. I subsequently emailed the team a few times to try and get one for use in the UK and never got any response.

If you are intentionally working towards a 51% attack you want your hardware earning up until is time to launch the attack, you mine in various pools to hide your power until you are ready to leave the pool and launch your attack.
If a certain pool is creating a disproportionate number of blocks they are advertising to the world their hash power and that's a foolish unlikely way for an intentional 51% attacker to behave so it's not a cause for concern.
Identifying blocks achieves nothing except create the illusion that you have some idea how hashpower is divided. Reality is you have no idea and you have to simply trust that &gt;50% is honest.
However it has a detrimental effect as we see now in that people can erroneously cry 'centralisation' and use worthless identified block statistics as 'evidence' to support the cause of keeping blocks small and limiting bitcoins potential.

You do talk alot of nonsense, I repeat my question.... How do you know that miner income is going to drop? You can't possibly know what price is going to do....a doubling is perfectly plausible, in fact considerably more likely than anything else however... It's also possible that 50% of miners will drop off at the halving therefore mining income will remain the same for the remainder.
@_date: 2015-08-16 00:04:59
From the further subdivision, instead of the 34th halving reducing the block reward from 1 to 0 satoshis, it becomes 0.5 satoshis and so on.

Dude, I understand and agree that if by printing to much money you cause inflation your robbing from everybody and that's bad, hence why I said, "if you can find a way to do it without causing inflation" then and only then is it fine.
For example, there's no reason for a government to issue interest bearing bonds in order to raise money, the fact that our governments do is heinous. If they want more money for public services they should simply print that extra money and then spend it on public services, then to counter the inflationary effects of that they can simply destroy the equivalent amount of money post facto when they receive it in taxes. So they have provided public services without the need of borrowing the money at interest or risking causing inflation.
A household can't do this sort of thing, hence why macro and micro economics are very different animals and why austerity in the face of public budgets deficits is a nonsensical policy.

Personally I don't keep bitcoin core running 24-7, rather I fire it up and sync it and run it for a few hours every few days as I need it. but that's not because of cost, simply that I don't see the need to do that with hundreds of nodes already in my country.

No, and that's kind of fundamental isn't it ?? You think this would only apply if.... Is that enough?
That there are other ways to earn bitcoins is moot if there's only one way to spend em.  
Also what about the fact that multiple hubs can have the same unidentified owner does this leave any way for us to even know that the centralisation of the money supply is happening? Doesn't look like it. 
At a cursory first glance of LN seems that the economics and incentives structure of it will result in fewer and fewer wealthier hubs over time until eventually there is just one ( albeit disguised as many ) and that hub will eventually buy out all the miners.
Edit - and you can close of the network to others because if you have more liquidity to provide you can offer the most in demand channels and routes the cheapest. No?

Sounds like bigger blocks will hinder miners in China a bit, where mining seems to be slightly more concentrated already and perhaps make another orphan or two per day...

Bitcoin was described in its whitepaper and Satoshi's early writings very thoroughly. That description is what people signed up for and bought into. Unless that spec for bitcoin actually fails, no-one has any business attempting to change it.
LN, from my own early attempts to understand its workings, seems to be entirely flawed from an economic perspective in that the hub that has the most bitcoin, can earn the most in fees. Ultimately it appears that this would tend towards centralisation of the holding of the existing money supply, which would be undetectable with simple obfuscation methods.
I may be wrong but Bitcoin has scaled up successfully for 6 years according to its original, well thought through spec that included technical and economic considerations. Lightning network is a totally different system designed by technical minds with no apparent studies on the economic or game theory implications of its approach.

No it's not, that's just your ( rather lop sided) way of looking at it. It makes no sense to say 'if they weren't minted at all' because they were minted at block one when the protocol was launched. There has always been and will always be 21 million bitcoins. The amount neither increases or decreases. The only variable is how many coins are circulating compared to being saved. If I get some bitcoins out of long term storage and spend them, has that cost the rest of the bitcoin users money? No of course not and what's the difference in terms of impact on the economy between my releasing them from long term storage and the block reward releasing them the new block. It makes no difference, there has always been 21 million bitcoins.

It will be interesting to see how much 'lack of revenue from halvings' actually is in USD terms as the network growth progresses.

How so?  I'll read the book you suggested but I can't see that lost wealth or opportunity cost are relevant in the question of whether a countries budget is the same or fundamentally different to a households, that a country can print money (albeit with great care and responsibility if they don't want to turn the populace into debt slaves or steal their wealth) means they are fundamentally different things.
You know there is a theory that the pyramids of Egypt were a huge public infrastructure project whose secondary (poss primary) purpose was to provide the entire populace with jobs, the pharoes simply printing money to pay anyone who wanted to work on them and carefully managing the value of said money by monitoring prices and destroying money they received in taxes to ensure it retained its worth. My point is that there's all sorts of ways of managing an economy, money printing, even interest bearing, is not inherently bad in and of itself.  It's what else is happening in the system that determines that. In the current system of course we are all being stolen from and turned into debt slaves, I'm not arguing with that.

As iwolf said, running a node has ample incentives on its own and the idea that somehow the block reward is a cost to all holders is just your choice of how to view it, in my mind all the 21M bitcoins exist already and so there is no difference between then being minted or not, tomorrow's blocks are having the same economic impact as any of yesterday's block that are in the hands of long term holders. Already existing and boosting value because they are not currently being circulated in the economy.

Macro (country) and micro (household) economics are completely different because in one you can create an unlimited supply of money. Actually budget deficits in the absence of inflation are a good thing because it means that the government have provided more public services without any real cost. ( assuming they are spending on things the public actually wants ). There is NO requirement for the money issuer to balance it's books in the same way that a household must. This is not to say they can just keep on printing of course but if they can find a way to print and spend without causing inflation ( or plundering natures resources to her detriment) then it's perfectly fine and to everyones benefit to run a huge 'deficit.

No it doesn't, it depends on the percentage of existing bitcoins that are being used as 'units of account' as compared to 'store of value' and when the latter reaches zero. 
Mining is not an expense any more than Satoshi deciding to liquidate his coins could be called an expense, all 21M bitcoins exists as far as inflation is concerned because everyone knows about them and that is true up to the point that all bitcoins are circulating as units of account.

True, but the number in regular circulation provides the constraint on price, not the amount in existence (this provides a constraint but its 'looser' and so has zero impact). If all the bitcoins in existence were circulating then it would be true to say that new blocks mined have an immediate cost to users but because the vast majority of bitcoins are in 'store of value' mode in the economy and all the users know that there is 21M coins in total its not correct to say that each mined block costs users money through inflation.

My initial comment was in response to your request for 'a convincing argument against segwit'.  And that has been provided with my points about facilitating 'Lightning' type multi hop payment channel networks being a net loss for the miners as it risks their fee income and threatens to reduce the second tier into a few centralised hubs which over time means less necessity and dependant on the main chain. If it's all the same I'd rather not get into block size since I also feel that the debate just goes around in circles.

Your initial assumption is not correct, the period of validationless mining is not because they are validating the previous blocks content and signatures, if it were you would be correct. It is because they have not received the previous block and this is not due to bandwidth and propogation delays, it is because they are connecting to their competing mining pools and as soon as they see new work in those pools they know a block has been found. In effect they have found a way to get a head start on mining the next block by connecting to each other but it requires a short period of validation less mining, for which they bear the risk and possibly the reward.

Whether Satoshi would or would not support Segwit, is not something I am prepared to guess at.

I was simply remarking on the facts that Satoshi plainly wrote about his support for unlimited block sizes, and Nick Szabo has written about the need to keep blocks small, therefore it is very likely that they are not one and the same person... I didnt even mention segwit.

Pretty certain ... Good ...
The thing is a huge use case for poor economies and indeed for richer economies is sub dollar electronic payments which aren't really feasible on credit/debit card networks due to fees. Bitcoin originally held that promise but it seems to be being unnecessarily subverted. 10c is too much of a fee for a dollar payment. Whether it's lower than other cost options is not really the point ... The question is whether it can fill that niche or not.
And yes I know LN will save the day .... Except that no one has figured out how to prevent the routing from reducing the network to a few centralised entities over time. Which is a far far worse outcome than concentrated hashpower in a few hands.

None of those fines have stood up to challenge, although a few have been paid by people who didn't challenge them. That's not the same question though.
I don't think your right and haven't been able to find / shown any evidence to the contrary. All WiFi hotspots in hotels and public spaces would have to be shut down if that were the case, btopenzone is huge in UK and works by letting BT users access each other's hotspots, we have WiFi on the buses and tubes etc. None of that would be happening if operators were held liable for misuse by their users.

Because segwit is unnecessary for litecoin, litecoin is not at max capacity therefore it's not a like for like comparison. Is a LN on litecoin going to be representative of a LN layer for bitcoin? No, because there is almost no economic activity on litecoin.
Is the price movements of litecoin indicative of the benefits of segwit? No, with such a shallow liquidity pool, low price and with such a politicised issue such as the scalability of a challenger to the incumbent banking system means that the price of litecoin is bound to fluctuate with the introduction of segwit. This can more accurately be attributed to simple speculative activity rather than any real foresight into added utility and value, litecoin doesn't need segwit because it doesn't have any use cases at the moment and segwit won't open it up to any either.

Miners mine empty blocks while they are still validating the previous blocks to ensure they don't include any of the already confirmed transactions, it allows them to negate the time to validate which benefits them and therefore the network generally.   If the hardfork to 2mb is successful that will be the most helpful thing they could do with regards to helping with transaction load.
@_date: 2016-02-18 17:11:05
Yes except in the case we are discussing here the miners don't yet have a copy of the block, they have connected to a competing pool and so have seen that that pool has found a block because they have received a new block header to work on as a miner in that pool but they don't yet know the full content of the last found block by that pool. Make sense?

I understand leverage perfectly well and your right, for those that have coins on the exchanges that permit leverage they can possibly sell extra coins in advance of depositing them, however, I highly doubt exchanges will permit this because they are able too see that those trades are dependant on crippled chain and there is no guarantee that the coins will be deposited in a timely fashion to cover the leverage, those positions will be watched closely and likely closed against the fiat security requirements. Also this only accounts for a tiny proportion of the coins required to actually buy up the price of a crippled chain.
@_date: 2016-02-25 18:43:50
There is no cost to 'actually relaying them'.
There is a risk of having your coin in a hot LN wallet which is proportional to the amount being held. This risk is the only justification for any fees at all on LN txs.
Fees of course will tend towards cheapest as there will be huge competition, every body with coins in long term storage will want to provide liquidity and earn a few bits for doing so because it will be so easy and almost completely risk free ( save hackers accessing your node and stealing your keys).
Ultimately the biggest btc holders can offer the cheapest fees and the most liquidity, which earns them more btc in a self perpetuating cycle.

Fiat funds are sent directly over traditional wires between trading parties. This is slow admittedly so it's more akin to LBC than Stamp for example but they have developed a way to cryptographically prove that you have initiated the fiat transfer that is really innovative.

Same economy or different, whatever, they're connected certainly. I agree that "Bitcoin network thus cannot sustain itself...etc etc " That much is obvious, but you started by suggesting that mining is an ongoing increasing inflationary cost/expense to bitcoiners, which it is clearly not by any reasonable definition of inflation or cost. And there is no incentive to run nodes... which there are.  Anyway, I'm bored now.

The absence of anything in the white paper that restricts block size is what I'm referring to, and of course the other early writings and descriptions by Satoshi that describe how the system can scale.
You kind of twisted my point about fee income into a reason to keep block sizes small, let me clarify ... if I was a miner I would want to maximise the fee income through number of fee paying transactions as opposed to amount of fee per transaction because it seems to have a lot more potential for increased income. Fee per transaction will hit a ceiling because of competing payment networks fees and or psychological resistance a long time before number of fee paying transactions hits a ceiling, assuming that block space is NOT a limiting factor ... then human population is the only limiting factor and of course in this scenario the block rewards also have an opportunity to increase their value considerably.
Multi hop payment channel networks would be undesirable to me because upon my cursory analysis it seems likely that they would reduce the system into a small number of hubs with high liquidity and the need for on chain settlement would, over time become less and less necessary as more of the user base became connected to fewer and fewer hubs. Over time this scenario results in those with the most initial capital ending up with all the fee income and the mining network becoming irrelevant, even more so if the block space is restricted making settlement expensive.

Care to justify your claim of instant confirmations? 
Looks more to me like pre-confirmations of an incorrect amount then my refund transaction when I want to actually close the channel will require just as many confirmations as any other regular transaction and will be just as susceptible to chain forks.

Its not hard to tell, is easy to tell. Miners want to be able to sell their coins which requires a chain that works. A UASF will quickly became a user activated chain stump if it doesn't have sufficient mining power along with it.  How are users going to buy up the price of their UASF if the few miners that are mining it can't meet the difficulty required to transfer their coins into the exchanges?
@_date: 2016-02-22 11:35:45
What we are talking about is one specific change namely the max allowed block size, this is something that was always part of the original design and also desired by most of the user community. Certainly if more than 50% of miners are happy with blocks larger than 1MB and the most of the user base agree then it can and should happen. That does not apply to other protocol changes like the 21m coin cap for example.
Yes 50%+ of miners can change the protocol with the agreement of the economic actors whom they serve and it doesn't matter if you call that an attack/hard fork/network upgrade, labels are not what's important.
@_date: 2015-07-22 15:38:02
No its not, a blockchain with  1mb blocks forever and some sort of sidechain / 2nd tier network approach was not specified in the bitcoin whitepaper.
If the blockchain starts with Satoshi's genesis block, it is designed according to Satoshi's Whitepaper and it has the most work, It is Bitcoin blockchain and bitcoin currency. 
Thats what I bought into, and that's what I'm sticking with.
Labels dont matter much anyways.

Nonsense, micro transactions were partly what inspired the creation of bitcoin. They were well considered in its design. They appear frequently in the ledger. They are a serious competitive edge for bitcoin over competing payment/monetary systems which are truly unsuitable for microtranasactions. They are a crucial aspect of onboarding 'the other six billion' and poor economies and unless the network deviates from its intended design by failing to lift the blocksize regularly I'll continue to use them to send a couple of pennies from one phone to another to demonstrate bitcoin for many years to come.
@_date: 2016-02-25 15:34:06
Except in the case of mining you need more capitol from outside the bitcoin economy to grow your position within the bitcoin economy therefore more mining is beneficial as it grows the bitcoin as a whole.
With LN routing you need more bitcoin to grow your hub and earn, in turn, more bitcoin. Therefore it contributes nothing in terms of bringing external investment into the bitcoin economy and does threaten to centralise the money supply into fewer and fewer hands, whilst hijacking fees that would otherwise be going to miners to enable them to pay for more hashing hardware/bandwidth upgrades etc.

No I agree, however I'm not sure there is a huge role for lightning if main chain scales and transactions remain in the realm of a few cents for next block confirm. I guess they could fill the niche of sub 5 cent micro-payments and possibly be a kind of HFT layer to help increase speed, security and transparency of exchanges.
@_date: 2016-02-25 15:57:33
As far as the bitcoin economy is concerned that's a zero sum transaction. No value has been added or removed from bitcoins market cap. There's no problem with this.
My concern is what proportion of that market cap is held by a single individual and how likely is it that lightning routing ends up further consolidating bitcoins into fewer and fewer hands. LN as currently explained enableds people to increase their bitcoin holdings proportionally to how big their bitcoin holdings already are... That's not an issue?

We can be 100% sure that Satoshi spent allot of time figuring out the scaling of bitcoin and increasing block sizes were a fundamental part of that plan.
There is evidence supporting the idea Nick is Satoshi and other evidence supporting the idea that Nick is not Satoshi , the fact that he appears to support the 'small blockers' who would cripple bitcoin and introduce substantial fees decades before any fee market is truly necessary is in the latter group of evidence. To me it's the final nail in the coffin of the 'Nick is Satoshi' theory.

Perhaps miners want to scale on chain as described in the white paper and are not convinced by the reasons given for that not being possible. Also perhaps the miners have serious doubts about the viability of lightning networks and their possible impact on the incentive structure, centralisation hazards and loss of fee income. Perhaps miners are refusing segwit specifically because they don't want to facilitate multi hop payment channel networks.

Actually running XT is a great idea because you vote on what you want bitcoin to be by choosing what software you run. If that means their is two competing versions of the blockchain, so be it. If that slows down mass adoption, so be it. 
If bitcoin-core isn't going to scale according to the original design I'm going to switch to something that will. If that is bitcoinXT then that's what I'll use and if enough people do the same, then that becomes bitcoin and no well funded propaganda campaign to distort bitcoin into something else entirely can change that.
@_date: 2016-02-18 17:21:13
OK, I concede you're point, but it doesn't negate mine. 
Larger blocks can also draw in more miners as a result of increased price facilitated by increased adoption.
Can you find me a miner who will drop out if the classic fork usurps core? I'm pretty sure I can find some people who would invest in mining equipment if price begins to show some signs of life again.
Larger blocks therefore may both increase and decrease the amount of miners and mining.

Im assuming its controvsersial because a majority of miners dont support and at least more than an inconsequential number of the user base dont support it.´
The miners will continue to mine the non segwit, original side of the chain and the UASF side will grind to almost a halt. Its true that users could sell down the price of the non segwit side, but they couldnt buy up the price of the UASF side because the chain is not functional ... Without the price of the UA segwit side increasing what motivates miners to switch to it ? And are the supporting users really going to sell their original chain coins before they even have any support from the miners on the UASF chain ? No they are going to want to make sure that UASF side is at least functional before they sell their other coins....
@_date: 2017-04-11 02:54:07
Your hypothesis doesn't take into account the problems that a minority hash rate chain has in terms of continuing to function.

It's in accurate to claim that lightning provides instant payment verification. It takes an equal number of confirms to open a payment channel securely as it takes to get security on a regular bitcoin transaction. Equally to close the channel and finalise the payment takes an equal number of confirms and is just as susceptible to network forks as any regular bitcoin transaction.
At best you can say that lightning is  'instant' only because you have prepaid with an incorrect amount and waited the correct amount of confirms for your prepayment to clear. Only difference is now you need to be given your change in the final transaction, which still requires that you wait the recommended amount of confirms before you consider it safe from forks.

The instant it actually becomes a problem it will be resolved.

Generally when people are very emotional in conversation it signifies that they are not entirely comfortable with their own arguments. 
Your time to verify quadratic signatures argument is easily countered with simple routines regarding max verification time, or max signature operations which is already in some implementations of bitcoin. 
The recent fork as a result of bip66 rules worked out fine, only the miners who took the risk lost out on their block rewards.  Everyone who uses SPV or bitcoin generally should educate themselves and then take responsibility for their own level of confirmation risk.

 When you say a constantly expanding economy do you mean the continual creation of more interest bearing debt based money? Because actually the other way to pay back the principle plus interest of previously issued debt based money is for the borrower to be able to continually re-earn the same money back from the lender.

I think its quite plain that by 'expressing their acceptance of valid blocks' means that they decide for themselves what is valid for them.  This works of course, because of the constraint that if more than 50% of the hashpower disagrees on 'valid' then they will be orphaned. There is the consensus mechanism of Bitcoin. Not conferences, developers meetings nor user or even miner votes embedded in the chain.  This mechanism ensures that the miners respond to the will of the economic majority.
@_date: 2015-07-09 14:42:27
Your right it's a shame to have to resort to this but I think it's inevitable, the status quo and entrenched interests in the current financial system have to much resources and reach, they will fight dirty. Hiring all the 'core devs' plus huge numbers of shills plus manipulating forums etc is nothing to them.  The design of bitcoin is such that it deteriorating into a majority rules scenario with multiple competing blockchains popping up and fading is probably inevitable and while this is not good for its reputation and reliable growth it's better that way than a system that can be co-opted by those with entrenched interests and huge financial resources.
@_date: 2016-02-25 14:27:44
Bitcoin fees depend on the number of bytes in a transaction.
Lightning fees depend on the amount of bitcoins in a transaction.
No one has shown how the routing will work in lightning, it seems very likely that it will centralise over time into fewer and fewer 'hubs' with more and more spokes. This will centralise the money supply into fewer and fewer rich hands.
This is a far worse outcome than centralising of mining which can always be re-decentralised through the addition of more miners.
Lightning can be useful for certain things but if it becomes the only way to do small bitcoin transactions at reasonable cost, I'm out.

@_date: 2016-02-26 15:18:41
I understand fine how it works. At some level it needs to facilitate pathfinding from A to B through available liquidity providing channels much like how the original ripple was supposed to work. The path finding algorithm will need to be optimised for fee minimisation and as such hubs with the most liquidity, which can provide routing with the least possible hops ands fees will win the business. Earning themselves more fees that they can plough back into liquidity and opening more channels in a self reinforcing circle.

Its cost is in the fiat economy, and its paid for by the miners when they buy their rigs and pay their bills. And they are very happy to do that because they make profit in the fiat economy.

I think you should re-read the prior comments. Feel free to edit in light of your new understanding afterwards.
Either way, the point you failed to make is still wrong because like so many others you seem to believe that mining pools are the same thing as hardware owners, they are not. Mining pools were invented to allow hardware owners to combine their resources and share the profits, by definition they are made up of multiple hardware owners.

The idea that the blockchain as originally designed cannot scale has never been demonstrated in reality.  Satoshi certainly thought it could 'it never really hits a scale ceiling' ... it has scaled up to today's size exactly according to that original design and those who insist it can't continue have only their theories and assumptions on which to base their ideas.  The attacks and problems they postulate with continuing to scale according to satoshis ideas have never been seen in reality and as such to describe their notions as fear mongering is accurate.

For instance what happens over time if one hub had slightly more startup capital available than the others and decided to attempt to make as much profit as possible. Would that hub not undercut other fees and in doing so end up with more open channels, which enables it to earn more fees than others which in turn gives out more capitol to use to open yet more channels and earn yet more fees in a continuing cycle until LN has completely centralised the supply of bitcoin into a few rich hands..
This is strikingly similar to how fiat currencies enrich the banking system to the detriment of the populace.

What costs are you referring to?
There is opportunity cost of not having your bitcoin available for other purposes and there is a risk premium for keeping it in a hot LN node. Both of these a proportional to the amount and therefore fees also will be proportional to the amount of the transaction.
The only other fixed cost is negligible, the cost of running the node which will require far less resources than a bitcoin node does today ... It's more akin to a wallet application.
There is no way that LN fees will not be proportional to the transaction amount, even the technical papers confirm that will be the case.

Controversial uasf is a fallacy, it would result in the user chain grinding to a rapid halt and the users quickly realising that they are more dependent on miners than they believed.
@_date: 2016-02-18 13:40:22
No because you again claim that empty blocks are somehow a problem, which they are not and also because you suggest that '1mb is already causing problems'. Actually mining empty blocks IS THE solution for those few miners who are looking for ways decrease their validation times, to claim that they need too because blocks of 1 MB are to large however is guess work at best. More likely is that they simply are connecting directly to their competing mining pools and receiving an almost instant notification that a block has been found by that pool, circumventing the p2p block propogation network entirely. All of which is miners finding their own solutions to their own problems. Which in turn means they are not waiting for work and their hashpower is always on which benefits the network in terms of increased security.

Because with 51% of miners co-ordinating anything can be accomplished in the same way as a 51% attack on the network can be successful. They 51% simply agree to orphan any blocks coming from the other 49%.
@_date: 2017-04-28 00:47:27
So, explain how is it that you know that exactly? Because I understand bitcoin very well unless I'm missing something huge,  mining is anonymous and there is absolutely no way to know anything about the distribution of the hardware amongst it's owners.

I disagree, that one CPU equals one vote was obviously equivalent to one hash equals one vote from the off.
Also I don't believe that bitcoin is subject to the control of a couple of people in China as you say. Pool operators are not miners... And even if it were true that one or two entities do wield control over 50%+ of hash power at the moment it's not a permanent state. So long as the network keeps growing more miners will join to rebalance ... Unless it's not allowed to grow.
By your logic, the only way to change bitcoins blocksize is with the consent of all the users and the only way to contact them is to go out and meet them. Which is pretty much impossible since they are globally distributed... So how will it ever happen?
@_date: 2016-02-06 03:11:55
No ...
It will be at least 50 years before the bitcoin blockchain needs to be able to handle 'all the world's transactions' and neither you nor anyone else has any idea of what processing power / storage and bandwidth will be by then. If growth trends for those things continue, and theres every reason to believe they will actually vastly outperform their historic tends as we move into the era of quantum scale computing, then it's certainty well within the realms of possibility that bitcoin nodes will be able to handle that and more. Possibly all the solar systems transactions. 
Inherent in the design of scaling for bitcoin is a continually kick the can mentality as technological progress allows, and this is perfectly fine.
As for 'lightning network' , rather than solve all the problems that small blockers imagine exists with the original design in bitcoin, if you examine it objectively, ignoring the fact that yes technically its clever,  from a game theory and incentives alignment perspective it appears that it will inevitably centralise the money supply into fewer and fewer hands. 
If the more btc I have, the more liquidity I can provide, then the more I can earn in fees and then the more btc i have etc etc until we end up in a situation where the so called lightning network had facilitated a single entity possessing practically all the bitcoins... 
@_date: 2016-02-18 17:14:06
Yes the new block would be invalid if it contained previously confirmed transactions.
It's possible but very unlikely since if it were the real reason for empty blocks then it would be consistent and all blocks from a particular pool would be empty, that's not what we are seeing.

The thing about nations, that only becomes apparent with a lot of questioning and thinking, is that they are largely defined by their currencies, so it doesn't really make sense to ask whether nations could adopt bitcoin. Rather the pertinent question is what becomes of a nation when most of its citizens are not using the national currency anymore ... Does it still even exist?  Bitcoin can't really scale fast so any transition would take a long time but I think it's more likely to be the case that the internet and all its users could adopt bitcoin and as a result the idea of separate nations will start to become less and less important. 
Re bitcoin mining .. it will always have an element of gambling to it, those who say you can't or can definitely make a profit are talking beyond their ability because the key factor in profitability is the value of the block rewards in fiat terms and this is something that is highly volatile and unpredictable and will continue to be for some time to come. Once you really understand bitcoin and also how the current fiat system really works you'll probably wish you had a big chunk of cash to invest in hardware and a cheap electricity supply.

The health of the mining market is not what I was referring to, only miners care about that. the health of the network and the experience of the end user suffers no detriment with a majority of power in a single yet honest hand. and yes a majority mining per can change the block reward upwards and in doing so they would cause a hard fork in which the rest of the users would have to decide to follow them off have a dysfunctional network for a while.

No I'm not saying that, all I'm saying is that profitability is impossible to predict because it's dependant on an unknowable factor, namely future price movements.
I can tell you for sure that if you need to ask advice about whether or not mining is a good idea for you then you are still lacking in terms of your knowledge about it and bitcoin in general.

There simply does not exist enough hardware in the world, you would have to seize the existing hardware and for that you would have to be able to locate enough of it within your jurisdiction. The only government that could theoretically do that is the government of the PROC and if that happened it would not be difficult or controversial to get consensus amongst the users, and business's for a POW change rendering the entire seizure attempt a pointless waste of time.

If it makes all sig smaller then that is a scaling benefit which should reduce fees, which in turn will help bitpays business model. Aggregation though is useless to them because the vast majority of spending on bitpay is done by individuals who only need one signature on their transactions.


You didn't understand my remark, or don't know what MAST is .. MAST only benefits complicate smart contracts, it doesn't affect any simple basic transactions whose redemption criteria are simple signature checks.  Ok so if alot of other people were using complicated smart contracts with many conditions then the reduction is space would have a knock on effect to regular sig check transactions, but how many of those types of transactions exist today ? Essentially zero..


SA or Signature aggregation, is of no benefit to transactions that only have one signature. Like people spending their own money on their own purchases.


Point me to the research, the papers, the solution .. 


Bitpays business model, is about converting bitcoins into fiat currencies, they provide an api that makes it easy for merchants to accept bitcoins and then do an instant conversion so that merchants recieve money in their local bank accounts, in their local fiat currency. This gives merchants the ability to benefit from bitcoins speed, global reach, security etc etc without them having to deal with keys, exchange rates, nodes and mostly volatility.

The P2P network was never intended to function at large scale in the same way as during the bootstrapping phase. The only consensus relevant to Bitcoins design is the consensus on the chains contents arrived at thorough the competitive mining process. If people want to spin off new consensus rule sets, if miners want to switch chains ... And even if people want to have a go at hijacking the Bitcoin brand ... It all perfectly fair game. That's what decentralised means, there's no one controlling any of this.

There is no actual evidence that bigger blocks lead to centralisation just hypothetical hand wavy theories pushed by people who are pissed off that they never figured out how to do decentralised digital currency and aren't sitting on Satoshis millions.  Now that the mining market has become so incredibly competitive they cant compete on that playing field either and so have decided that the whole thing cant possibly work as designed and therefore we are going to need layer 2 which, surprise surprise they have a solution for and which will allow them to earn fees.
To try and dispel some of the nonsense arguments they come up with ....Just because it cant scale to Visa levels immediately, doesnt mean that it cant ever. Hardforking evey couple of years to a bigger block size, with consideration for technical limitations and node affordability is the correct approach, as the designer of the system always intended.
Just because the coin amount of the block reward is diminishing doesn't mean that the value of the block reward will diminish. Competitive mining can continue to pay for the security of the network for many decades yet, so long as the network is allowed to grow in users and therefore value. 
At the end of the day, if you are suggesting that the market forces, will kill bitcoin if left to their own devices, then unfortunately bitcoin, by its decentralised nature will kill itself.. nothing can govern it except the market forces. If developers do succeed in controlling it against the will of the market then its not an exit from centralised monetary control at all, its just a different set of masters.

The users can enforce what they like on their local copy of the chain, if enough of them share the same enorcement rules then they may have a chance at getting miners to mine for them. Equaly the miners can mine whatever chain they want and if they mine a chain thats attractive to users, maybe those users will buy and use that chain.
Honestly I havent heard many people claim that s2x has anything other than overwhelming consensus amongst miners, i think most s2x supporters understand that any claims about consensus amonst users are essentially unverifiable and as such are not worth much.

I've read it, I can't see how is even relevant to this conversation. PayPal never had a distributed network of miners maintaining their transaction database that was spread across at least 50 different legal jurisdictions. Some of which were completely anonymous and untraceable. It was quite clearly always open to accessible to and subject to the rule of law in those jurisdictions in which it operated. A crucial difference is that if for example the US government told the US PayPal that it had to suspend services, then they would have no choice in suspending services in the US. If the Korean government decided to ban mining in Korea then those transactions will simply be mines elsewhere, no users will be affected.

They don't, they only help the person running the node to verify their own transactions and to verify that they are following the chain they want to follow, the idea that somehow they pressure miners into mining blocks that they will accept is a misnomer, if you want to pressure miners into mining blocks that you will accept the only mechanism you have is price, buy or sell coins you like or don't like. Your node doesn't achieve anything because nodes can easily be faked, if they could achieve any influence over the miners then Bitcoin would be broken by design, at the mercy of anyone with a tiny amount of capitol who wants to spin up a few thousand fake nodes.

No, you say this because you did not fully absorb and accept my other statements. Consensus in bitcoin is only relevant in the context that it is something to be arrived at through the process of competitive mining, and the only thing it indicates is that the users of a particular chain agree on the contents of that chain.
Your comments only make sense if you are still of the erroneous mindset that consensus somehow means everyone agreeing on how the chain works and by what rules things are considered valid. This, as i mentioned previously, is a recent invention, ... completely nonsensical and used and abused by those who intend to prevent people from having the freedom to choose the what they consider valid or not, and sharing economic activity with those who happent to agree with them.

The chase is this, there​ exists no reliable way to measure consensus, for that very reason Satoshi invented a very clever mechanism using proof of work such that a consensus could be arrived at by way of haahpower .. that is a consensus of the contents of the blockchain.   
I don't claim that there is consensus for s2x because I don't claim to be able to what many have tried and failed to do before me, accurately gauge the opinion of a large diverse group of people . . There are no voting systems that can't be gamed, no social networks that can't be gamed and no possible way to know whether something really has 'consensus' or not reliably. For that reason the s2x crowd are going with what they have which is a reliable measure of consensus amongst miners by way of block signalling and statements of support from the biggest and best known business in the sector.

The belief that large blocks encourage centralisation is a myth, unproven, completely contrary both the design of bitcoin and also to the common sense that larger blocks encourage more users, a higher price and therefore more miners and .. or course more decentralised network. Maybe less full nodes .. but that way always a part of the plan and doesnt speak to centralisation in any way.

If people want to fork off and follow a different set of validity rules that's up to them. If a majority of miners and a few large business want to follow different validity rules, they have every right to do so... if the devs dont want too, they can stay on whatever chain they like. Consensus is not required to make changes to bitcoin, only individual action... What I call bitcoin or what you call bitcoin has no bearing on what the next person calls bitcoin .. none of them have any bearing on what bitcoin actually is. the only person that really has any right to try and define what is and what is not bitcoin vanished in 2012. 
My node has a copy of the chain, i can put whatever i like in my blocks.dat, those changes do not require consensus .. If by chance many business and miners also  have the same thing as me in their blocks.dat then we can share in economic activity. Its in my interests to go with the majority, but if I want to make changes i can do so without asking any devs / miners or business. At the cost of being able to participate with those who don't join me. In the case of s2x, those that want to go along with it can, those that dont dont have too, they are free to continue mining whatever validity rules they like and are free to continue calling their chain Bitcoin, the exchanges are also free to use the term bitcoin however they like, as are devs and users.
@_date: 2017-09-28 03:01:36


No, if 97% of the miners stop mining 1x then according to all the economic incentives that make bitcoin work, eventually it will have to hardfork or die. It will be the hardfork that will inevitably be coded and offered to the community by the existing core devs that results in the survival of the 'legacy' chain.
@_date: 2017-10-18 03:03:13
If successful this split will provide support for the fact that developers don't control anything. The idea that the current developers have somehow lost control and new one have gained it will mean that the new ones will equally lose control when a proposal cooked asking that the miners, business and users rally around.

So your saying that in order for bitcoin to stay bitcoin, all it needs to do is hard fork to a different consensus ruleset with a tiny proportion of its original hashpower. And in the same breath you claim that the huge majority hashpower, who has also split off to a different (although far less deviant) consensus ruleset now is an altcoin and is not bitcoin.
I dont quite see how miners lose anything by mining a fork of bitcoin and in the same process forcing what remains of bitcoin to hard fork to stay alive. I think they would gain quite alot, well at the least they would gain what the vast majority are signalling that they want. 
Obviously you believe that the minority chain is entitled to still be called bitcoin after this all happens, but the reality is that what you or I believe has no bearing on what the user community, (which includes all the miners and business in support of s2x) will actually do. I suspect that in order to avoid headlines like 'Bitcoin loses 80% of its security, the return to GPU mining means its now trivially easy to attack' or 'Bitcoin civil war results in transactions that never confirm despite exorbitant fees' the majority will probably start calling s2x Bitcoin, and there is not a thing you or i could do to stop them ....

Sunshine ? Really ....
Did you even understand my point? even if the numbers were off a little, the point is still valid. It is in miners interest to kill off one chain or the other, if the attack comes in the form of mining empty blocks on the minority hashrate chain, then what exactly is it that you think the nodes are going to do about it ? Co-ordinate over twitter to come to consensus about what is valid or not ? Start calling invalidate block on blocks as instructed by r/bitcoin admins ? No, the node software will of course keep following the longest valid chain even if it means they are following the attackers chain that contains zero transactions. If a majority of miners want to kill a chain, they can do it regardless of how many nodes dont want them too.. unless those nodes have some external means of arriving at consensus .. In the case of s2x, I highly suspect one side of the fork will try to kill the to other.

This doesn't change the validity of my assertion that private keys are worthless in a regulated environment. It doesn't secure my real assets from their custodian nor does it provide our prevent my access to those assets because the law serves that purpose regardless of keys.  Whomever is custodian of the real assets is going to have an interesting time when they get audited for kyc because they will effectively have to say, "well we hold these assets but we don't know who for because users of this blockchain don't have to register with us to transfer these assets between themselves. However we will only allow them to be redeemed by verified customers". Well that's no defence as far as AML and KYC go because they could be facilitating any amount of laundering as assets in their custody change ownership without their oversight.

That's my point, if the criteria for the decision on whether or not your coins are redeemable for fiat by the issuer consists anything other than 'Do you have the private keys', which by law it must do,  then the whole block chain serves no useful purpose in this service.  You haven't put fiat on a blockchain at all, you've simply created the impression of doing so until people want to get hold of their actual fiat and discover they are still subject to the same rules/regulations and friction points as any regular non blockchain fiat currency. Private keys don't mean anything if they don't give you sole, complete exclusive control over your actual value and in the case where your using a blockchain to represent fiat held in custodial accounts by some third party, the private keys don't give you that. The only thing they can possibly give anyone is a legal regulatory headache for the custodian of the funds in the event that someone actually tries to use any of the main features of the blockchain like pseudonymous transfers.

I'm delighted that it's happening, it will be a defining moment in bitcoins history and finally cement the truth in people's minds which is that the miners, as a decentralised collective are the only one who have a vote about the rules by which the protocol operates.

I haven't checked the numbers but bear in mind that signaling segwit is very different to signaling UASF.  For a miner is very easy to signal segwit without risk, but if a miner follows the UASF and it doesn't win they have lost a sum of money proportional to their share of the hashrate, plus their electricity costs.
Don't assume that signaling segwit means they will follow UASF, to do so would be foolish for a miner.
@_date: 2017-05-31 03:35:05
You can repeat it as many times as you like, it doesnt change the fact that for a chain to have value it must be functional and for that you need miners. Therefore its nonsense to say that miners will follow the money because unless they go first a chain has no value.

Because, very much like in the Byzantine generals problem that POW mining was designed to solve, they have no way of coming to consensus on the fact that they are all going to mine it, if just a few of them do then those few face a huge financial loss. Signalling on the blocks themselves would be the best method of declaring their intentions but since only around 30% are signalling segwit at all it seems that signalling a controversial and potentially costly activation method for segwit is even less likely to happen.

Segwit is only an 'effective' block size increase because the devs have simply decided not to count the Sig data within the 1meg limit ... it still needs to be transmitted and recorded so there's no justification really for not counting it inside that limit.  If they weren't playing central economic planning policy committee then they would have kept the sig data in the block size count and simply raised the max block size to be 1.7 or whatever to give us the same overall effect but without the policy committee.
Schnorr SIG's will save block space for some transactions.
What is AS?
MAST doesn't save/reduce any of current block space but does facilitate the creation of large more complex scripting without an associated increase in block space.  Equally it doesn't 'improve privacy' for any existing use cases as oft claimed but it does allow new complex scripts be used and they have a nice built in privacy aspect in that only a portion of the script will ever be revealed.
Nothing here is really a long term solution to the necessary block size increases that are the inevitable result of more users wanting to make more transactions, which is a prerequisite to bitcoins continued growth in terms price and corresponding network security.

And how exactly are the users going to buy up the value of UASF coins when :-
1) no miners can risk mining then UASF chain until they are sure that all the miners are going to mine it, they cant be sure that others miners are going to mine it without some sort of signalling, which so far isn't happening.
2) Exchanges cant process deposits or withdrawals on the UASF chain because there aren't any miners mining it.
3)  Even if they are a few altruistic miners prepared to risk their cost and potential profits to keep the UASF chain alive, the exchanges cant run the risk of operating both chains because of replay attacks and the possibility of one chain dying out which would leave them in a position of having liabilities which they cant settle to their customers...
To summarise, you think you know how this is going to go down but you are assuming that its as simple as the market choosing between two chains and you are ignoring the technical aspects and economic forces that prevent the two chains existing side by side for long enough to permit the market to choose. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 14:37:37
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:51:40
It is a risk because miners cant spend their block rewards for 100 blocks.  That might be the first few days of a minority chain ... With a degraded useability and lack of customer services the risk is that whilst a minority chain might have enough miners to keep it ticking over initially, once the user experience begins to show it self for what it is miners may begin to drop out ... this can quickly spiral downards to the death of the chain and miners know this too well at the outset. Also how are miners going to know the value of the minority chain ? Buyers cant buy up the value of the minority chain if confirmations are slow because sellers cant move those coins onto exchanges .. the immediate price movements of minority coins already on the exchanges (if the exchanges even permit trading without the necessary replay and re-org protections ) will most likely be down. Etc Etc .. the economic incentives involved do mean that its a risk for the minority miners, a risk proportional in size to their share of the hashrate.

It doesn't work like that. With zero mining support the chain simply stops. Those miners that are signalling support for segwit may or may not be prepared to also follow the UASF ( a very different thing than signaling segwit) and actually follow through with attempting a split. In the case that they do they and they alone will be building a chain with initially a very long block time, no guarantee that the chain will still be alive by the time they can sell their block rewards and a lot of frustrated users complaining about confirmation time. All the while the profits from the actual main chain are a simple reboot away ... that's called the 'economic incentive' by the way.
How is a 'small segwit signaling chain activate segwit even if there were no miners mining actual segwit transaction blocks' actually going to work? What does a chain with no blocks actually look like? Success?

None of your points refute my assertion, I was careful to specify that 'decentralised trustless' part. Federated sidechains are not that, rather they are a response to the fact that decentralised and trustless sidechains are as yet unsolved ( without a hard forking change per sidechain as I previously mentioned ).
Neither SPV proofs nor drivechain negates the need for bitcoins nodes to know the state of the sidechain, it may not be necessary to know the entire utxo set but it's necessary to know something. That means that every bitcoin node, must be upgraded .. on a per sidechain basis. It'll never be the case that anyone can simply fire up decentralised trustless sidechain to bitcoin without first gaining consensus and justifying resource usage from the entire bitcoin network.

I don't think the network will ever have to rely solely on fees.
I suspect more likely is that well before the 33rd halving when the block reward is due to be reduced from 1 Satoshi to zero, the consensus will converge on increasing the resolution of each bitcoin to perhaps 16 decimal places. Then the block reward can continue its halving schedule for another couple hundred years.  There will still never be more than 21M bitcoins.

A shop can refuse to serve anyone they like based on their chosen payment methods. True enough if you eat in a restaurant then ask to settle with legal tender they are obliged to accept it because you have already incurred a debt but if you go to a restaurant and announce first that you would like to eat a meal and then pay in legal tender they can refuse to serve you based on the type of legal tender you want to use. The difference is subtle but it is certainly not the case that every shop in iceland will be forced to accept bitcoins just because they become legal tender. They can simply refuse to serve anyone who wishes to utilise that method of payment by posting a notice on the front door that they don't accept it.
edit - wikipedia articles states the same thing in its opening paragraph  - " The right, in many jurisdictions, of a trader to refuse to do business with any person, means a purchaser may not insist on making a purchase and so declaring a legal tender in law, as anything other than an offered payment for debts already incurred would not be effective.

Perhaps you didnt understand me the first time, in a world where everybody uses lightning for everything why would layer 1 be needed ?
So in order to buy my coins I open an account with a exchange that already has channels open with other exchanges and merchants and the routing to any other merchant, exchange or user is possible through the network of existing routes that I can access directly from my exchange account. I don't need to open a channel ever  .. and i never need to close a channel either because i can just forward my funds through the existing network of channels to an exchange that lets me convert back to fiat or gold or whatever ....
Hopefully you can see that in a world where everybody uses lightning for everything, layer 1 becomes completely redundant. 'Settling' will never be necessary and opening a channel will be a reserved for when new merchants or exchanges open and need to connect to the existing network, for a little while until merchants realise that they too don't need to pay to open channels if they can simply use their exchange which already has channels open to everyone (within a few hops) that they need to pay or receive payments from.
This scenario is already an eventual inevitability with the current design thanks to the inherent network effects but will be sped along by propoganda and rising base layer fees until such time as the network is just a collection of fewer and fewer centralised hubs that never settle to main chain, only between each other.

While it's true to say that there are fees, his statement that you 'get 100% of the value' is more correct than not because in bitcoin is the sender that pays the fees up front. The recipient receives what he asked for with no fees deducted.

Those values aren't the payout values, they are the amount of the claims that have been verified as what you would actually be getting if all hadn't been 'stolen' the actual repayments are likely to be some between 10 and 25% of the original amount, according to rumours and best effort calculations.

No its not, its you that apparently doesn't understand LN. The point is to have a trust less layer 2 which is what is achieved, no-one has control of your funds and if someone tries to rebroadcast an old channel state onto the network you have a timeout in which to contest it with your updated transactions.  However just because you are being sold on the idea that L1 will be the arbitration layer doesnt mean that is how it will play out. in fact having thought it through myself, rather than just taking the inventors word as gospel ... it seems likely that l1 will either be congested and expensive or simply redundant as better arbitration methods are built into layer 2 itself.  Like for example multi party channels where arbitration is done without resorting to layer 1, simply by having a third party arbitrator co-sign on all the channel transactions... or falling back on traditional court process to arbitrate disputes, which would be incredibly straightforward because all parties have cryptographically signed proofs of the channel state at all times ...

@_date: 2017-05-29 14:55:26
Let me repeat again for you ...
Why would I ever need to 'settle' to layer 1 when, after buying my coins, I can simply deposit onto an exchange and sell them directly to fiat using L2 .. or when I can transfer them to anyone or anywhere I need to directly using L2.
The more popular and used L2 becomes the less reasons I have to ever need to 'settle', until eventually L1 become totally redundant.
Eventually there won't be any reasons for anyone to ever 'settle', it'll just be an expensive unnecessary step.

The easiest way is probably too take a sha256 of the document. Use this hash as the private key and generate the corresponding bitcoin address, send some coins to it and then transfer them out again immediately.

Nonsense, Which exchange? 
If you mean those that have said they will support both sides, they don't count.
Bip48 involves refusing blocks that don't signal segwit. Any exchange that accepts both is putting zero pressure on the miners to support BIP48. 
Exchanges that properly support BIP48 are committing business suicide as well as opening themselves to tons of users complaints and an inability to process deposits and withdrawals. Which is why there aren't any.
The problem is that USAF only works if everybody does out at the same time, both miners and exchanges have a lot of money on the line if they go first and don't have the support of the rest of the economy. The is no easy way to measure that support ..   this is a classic example of the Byzantine generals problem, which is what bitcoin solves with POW.

It's not about the satoshi, its about the value of the satoshi. If bitcoin still exists by the time the mining reward diminishes to that level it will be because it has continued to grow in value and one satoshi in 2140 could be plenty to incentivise the mining network.
Edit, besides, by your logic, who will mine for 2 satoshis, or 4 or 8 etc, that's over a decade of mining during 2128 - 2140 you think it won't happen?

Yes it does, wether the signature data is part of a separate data structure to the rest of the block or not is irrelevant on how the bits are counted. New rule is 'regular block + sig data can not be more than 1.7MB'.
Instead of 'block size is 1MB but we will allow up to .7MB extra data that is appended to the block so long as it is in the form of segregated signature data'  - That is purposefully incentivising seg wit use and a new centrally planned and imposed economic policy decided by core devs.

You do realise that for a block to be accepted in a chain it must include the hash of the previous block ? 
A valid segwit block can only be accepted on one chain, the chain onto which it was intended to be built.
You seem to think that a minority chain is going to build itself, even if its dedicated miners are actually mining another chain ... Without a good quantity of miners giving up one chain and focusing exclusively on another, that second chain cant exist and unless those miners number greater than 51% of the total of miners mining both chains then they are likely to lose out to the economic incentives that underlie blockchains and strongly incentivise the minority miners to rejoin the majority chain.

I think you, like many people, are overlooking the interconnectness between the dynamics of mining and the value of the coin in the aftermath of a fork.  
You seem to be of the opinion that a minority chain, that has value to few people will survive with what it has. I'm trying to get you too see that the functioning of the network on a minute by minute basis directly after any fork is directly affecting its value proposition and continues to do so for the first few days until it stabilises.  After the ETH fork thinkgs stabilised very quickly because of 2 factors 1) a 17 second block time and  difficulty adjusted every block. 2) Its was cheap and posible to mine with basic graphics cards setups.  The coming BTC fork is in no way comparable and the chances of it stabilising into 2 chains that both survive is, practically nil, even within the first few weeks.  However what will likely happen is that the minority chain will be forced to hardfork its difficulty down, introduce replay protections and possibly change its mining algo, even then it will suffer from huge price drop. The point is that the sheeer quantity of hardforking changes necssary to sustain a minority fork of bitcoin mean that actually you  would have less hassle simply starting an alt.

I didn't say that bitcoins consensus mechanism requires a central authority. I said the respun version where non mining nodes supposedly have to enforce the rules is a version that requires a central authority so that those non mining nodes can agree on what is and is not valid. The original consensus mechanism as described in the white paper required no such central authority, only the 'longest' chain rule.
I'll also take the opportunity to note that who ever make the erroneous claim that mining has become to centralised is either ignorant or spreading FUD because it is also impossible (like measuring the users support of proposals like segwit) to measure the number of hardware owners and therefore impossible to know wether there is a problem of centralisation in mining.

In theory, but the reality is that whilst exchanges can support both chains, miners can not. They are risking alot of money by supporting UASF and as a result as of yet there is no dedicated mining power in support of BIP 148. As a result it won't be possible to put much buying or selling pressure on it because the coins on it can't move.  That said of course there are no doubt alot of coins already being held on exchanges so I guess that's a possiblity.

It's a tiny bunch of people who believe they can split off and operate their own chain even without any mining power or any exchange willing to facilitate trading of their coin.
They have a theory that if they simply stop accepting blocks they don't like it will force the rest of the network to produce blocks they do like.
The problem is that this only works if literally everyone does it at the same time and for anyone that goes first, that actually has an measure of influence in the system ( miners ), there is a huge financial risk in going first if not everyone goes with you.
This is a classic example of what's called the Byzantine generals problem and the UASF contingent are trying to solve it simply with a mass media campaign.

Take note here, basically this necessary and sensible step on the part of the exchange operator nullifies any pressure that might be put on the miners.
I know your all excited about UASF and all but realistically you can't have the economic pressure you need because it puts exchanges in an untenable position with regard to their ability to service their clients and their obligations to the same. As a bittylicious user I can assure them that I respect their stance but in the event that they refuse my use of the non USAF chain for my trading through their site I will have to go elsewhere and if I have coins tied up during the attempted fork I'll have to take legal action to regain them... But of course none of that is necessary because they're not really supporting it, their stance is equivalent to saying 'if everybody else supports it and the miners yield, then we will.'. Which of course puts zero pressure on anyone.

Fixed quantity commodity money is a totally different economy than centrally issued credit money. 
In credit fiat money the government can easily authorise the creation of the money to pay a basic income to everyone. With bitcoin though they cant really do it because they actually have to get the coins before they can give them out.  Its not really possible but then .. the problems that a basic income policy would solve wouldn't necessarily exist if the economy was operating on commodity money like bitcoin.

Think about it, if you issue token which you claim is pegged to GBP and is backed by an amount of bitcoin, first problem is price fluctuations what happens when the markets move and the amount of bitcoin have used per token is now not worth the GBP it's supposed to back? Second problem is that then your users trade amongst themselves and eventually a guy in Nigeria ends up with one GBP token, how can he exchange that for an actual GBP?
Answer is that he can't because because there is no one in Nigeria that has GBP with which to buy it from him, even as an FCA licenced institution you don't have a bank account that's denominated in GBP and accessible from Nigeria, if you did it would cost you traditional wire transfer fees to move actual Gbps to Nigeria which mean you token would need to have a premium attached to cover your expenses. Finally the FCA are going to withdraw your licence because you can't comply with their aml and kyc for Nigeria based identities.
Many small alts have tried to issue fiat denominated tokens on blockchains, that all fail because it's not possible. BitUSD a classic example, the way they implement their 'peg' means that token fluctuates in value away from a dollar quite regularly and if you have them you can't exchange them for actual dollars anywhere useful.  Tether, another example, they managed to get the peg working because they literally do maintain an open offer to buy and sell them at a dollar each but that restricts their geography and again means they need to comply with aml and kyc and as a result nobody uses it.
Fiat can't go on a blockchain because the value of money depends on its properties and fundamentally money on block chains has different properties to money held in regulated bank accounts. If you think it's possible, you can of course try but many have thought the same and tried and failed before you, other wise if it were possible don't you think one of those small alts would have gotten somewhere by now?

So in bitcoin, where only a fraction of the money is used for actual commerce, and a large portion of early coins have never moved at all, and everyone know that there will one day be 21M coins total, and price seems to trend upward overall since its inception. Can it really be true that the block rewards reduce the real value or purchasing power of other existing bitcoins? Personally I say no, in an economy where all bitcoins were circulating in trade all the time,  the money supply is saturated with economic activity, as opposed to     just storage / speculation, then yes its likely that the block reward is probably impacting purchasing power but even then, would I say its a cost that bitcoin holders are paying ?.. I'm not sure... because it doesn't really make sense to say that without the new coins existing coins would be worth more .. Satoshi picked an essentially arbitrary number for the supply. I think for the purposes of debating inflation, the fact that the coins were defined at the beginning means that peoples perception of the worth of the coins is not decreasing as new ones are brought into circulation and the fact that many are in cold storage and not circulating, means there is not yet enough actual economic activity in bitcoin for the introduction of new coins to reduce the purchasing power of the existing ones. Rather their purchasing power at the moment is, majoritively, a byproduct of speculatory demand.

You miss the point, with bitcoin you are actually transferring the asset on the blockchain. For that you want decentralisation and security.  NASDAQ aren't transferring assets in the blockchain, they are transferring tokens that can be used to claim assets from the issuer on the block chain. It's a fundamentally different thing. All NASDAQ wants is the benefit of the transparency and speed of the block chain, they will continue to use their contractual obligations and the relevant law and associated processes to actually transfer assets in a way that complies with the law.

2) The miners cant activate seg wit alone, until wallets support seg wit there is no increased throughput from it.
3) The main wallet in use on the network today is, for better or worse, blockchain.info web wallet, they are long time supporters of a block size increase.
I'd be very surprised if the combination one of the biggest wallet and one of the biggest mining pool both stating that there is no segwit without a block size increase wasn't enough to make the core dev team the ones that fold first.

So your saying the tokens don't need value if they are representing assets that have value.... Not sure I follow. Surely that's the same as saying the token has value.. Unless of course the users of the blockchain are going to fall back to another arbitrator in the case of an ownership dispute of one of the assets, but in that case the reason the token doesn't have value is because the blockchain is not the thing that is securing the assets.

If miners wanted segwit they would already be signalling for it.

No but zero fees for the first few decades of bitcoin is perfectly possible whilst the network security is being paid for out of the value that the network itself creates. There is no good reason to discourage a large portion of the possible market ( poor and developing economies ) for bitcoin at this early stage.

I didn't say that unemployed people are thrown in Jail.. I said that if you refuse to pay your council tax you are thrown in Jail and that is correct.
Yes its true that you can 'apply' for a council tax benefit payment for periods of unemployment, but in order to be granted a council tax benefit payment you first have to bend over to pick up the 'application form' and then you have to comply with certain orders with regard to work. Specifically you have to sign a contract to say that you will follow the directives of the Dept for Work and Pensions with regard to job hunting activities and then follow through with those directives and report back bi-weekly to have your compliance signed off on.
 
Its the same either way, just a different work... Either way you are forced to work and forced to hand over them majority of the benefits of that work. Under threat of a lot of grief initially and eventually prison and asset confiscation, probably by armed officers.

I'm not kidding myself, there is a cost it's true, but nobody pays it. The network creates value and uses a portion of it to pay for itself.

The idea that nodes somehow enforce rules is a recent invention, completely contrary to the design of the system which considered that only mining node would store and validate the chain. By its nature, this twisted new version of bitcoins consensus mechanism requires a centralised authority dictating what constitutes validity.
Nodes can't enforce anything except what they put into their own local copy of the block chain. The idea that nodes somehow collectively force the miners to adhere to validity rules that they as a collective decide is sadly nothing but wishful thinking since there is no mechanism by which nodes can come to agreement about validity ... which is why the original authentic nakamoto consensus mechanism was invented in the first place.
I didn't claim that the was evidence that the majority doesn't want segwit because I know that it's an unmeasurable claim.
I'm tired of explaining the reasons why the UASF IS a non starter and has more chance of proving that hash power is king once and for all than anything else, but if you want to pursue it feel free. When you arrive at the end of the user activated chain stump and find yourself unable to move your coins into the exchange to sell them for the tiny bit of value they might retain perhaps you'll think about rereading the satoshi whitepaper and early descriptions of the system and trying to understand it properly.

Thats not a re-org attack or censoring though is it.. that's a zero confirmation attack that worked because of a vulnerable service. Nothing to do with a centralisation problem with bitcoin. You could do that attack with zero hashpower.
Have you really not thought about this enough to see that the consequences are very different for solo owners as opposed to pool operators ? That's odd ...
A solo operator could repeatedly do 7 block reorgs ..  they could pull off a very profitable double spend every day and remain completely anonymous. The network and all users would be defenceless.
What would happen if a pool operator did a 7 block reorg and a double spend in the process ?  ... Same ?

It only takes 50% of them to drop out and the remaining 50% will still be earning the same as they were pre-halving, very few will drop out because they all hope they will be in the remaining 50%.
Bear in mind that in terms of miner revenue, a reward halving is equivalent to a difficulty increase. These may not be 50% but they have often been quite large and they happen every 2 weeks and very rarely do we see the total amount of mining power reduce as a result of them.

Its very likely that as time passes the block reward will continue to go up in fiat value as it has done, on average, continually to date.
PSA - Today's 12 coin blocks are worth far more than the 50 coin blocks where when they were mined in 2011. and in 8 years time the ~3 bitcoin block rewards will be worth far more than the 12 bitcoin blocks rewards are worth today.

The reason it cant be reversed is because its updating the balance of a previously confirmed transaction, not because it has received a confirm of its own. In every possible sense its pre-confirmed and not instantly confirmed.  If it was instantly confirmed there would be no need to wait for confirmations on the transaction that closes the channel. 
Locking up funds in a channel and still having to wait for channel closing transactions to confirm is not a better user experience. But we are both speculating a bit here, we ought to wait and see what software is actually delivered before we go making judgements about user experience.

Nobody can possibly know anything about the expected profitability of bitcoin mining unless they can predict the price movements of bitcoin, which clearly they can't.
Every existing miner is heavily incentivised to discourage new competition from entering the mining market.

Except there's still no trustless 2 way sidechain peg, even if one was invented it would require at least 2 years for the tech to be specified, debated, coded, tested, tweaked and adjusted then consensus sought and activated for a soft fork for the new opcodes, then there has to be a period of testing for users prepared to risk small amounts of money, eventually merchants might be happy to accept sidecoins.  Again no chance of it happening within 18 months. and that says nothing about the centralising forces that sidechains will face that may be just as scary the main chain centralising forces ... which are the reason for not simply increasing the throughput of bitcoins chain.

I don't think it'll drop overall but there could be some down pressure as well as the up pressure you mention.
Unless the core development team offer something more than just seg-wit and compact blocks, as a scaling plan, I've a feeling the main mining pools are going to begin supporting a block size increase independently, if the actual miners follow along with them and it actually happens ... a few large holders wont be happy about that and will sell out, not many but enough to see it reflected in price.

My point was that a pool could absolutely not get away with doing a 7 block reorg that included a double spend attack more than once. 
You offered up something which seems irrelevant as evidence of why that is not the case, namely a zero confirmation attack that can be performed with zero hashpower. 
Have you any evidence to show that hardware owners would not leave a pool that was responsible for a 7 block reorg ? I ask because, to my understanding, and I may be wrong, I'm not an expert... a 7 block reorg for the purpose of reversing a confirmation 7 blocks deep requires alot of hashpower that is prepared to sacrifice some block reward. Which is fine if there is the proceeds of a lucrative double spend to offset it.  So is the pool operator not in a position of having to either share the profits of the scam with the hardware owners or risk an exodus of miners due to, what appears to them to be, the pool having remarkably bad luck and corresponding low profits.

You speak to the 'wage' portion of the phrase only. In an anarchist fantasy world we could give up the 'profession' to live solely on what food, accommodation and medicine we can gather from what nature has provided (like every other living inhabitant of this abundant planet). We could also stop being forced to labour for the payment of 'taxes' without fear of being thrown in jail and having our homes stolen.
In England there is a 'council tax', Its about a tenth of a typical months income for low earners and if you outright refuse to pay it, they jail you quite quickly. They only accept UK pounds in payment. If you do earn UK pounds you have to pay around 20-45% in Income Tax and the vast majority of the remainder is subject to VAT at 17.5% when you spend it.
So in England, and I'm sure the same is true in most places, You are both forced to work and forced to give over the vast majority of the fruits of your labour to the government in taxes. Hence the term 'wage slave'.

If you really believe this is demonstrates an astonishing ignorance of basic economics of bitcoin.

I think you might be making this more difficult than it needs to be.
Just watch the transaction stream for a while and you will see that plenty of people use bitcoin for very high value transactions, so its obviously not that hard.
Transacting parties simply agree on a rate provider before they transact. There are plenty of rate aggregators also like bitcoinaverage.com which can also be used.
Bitcoin is inherently volatile but because the chances of a move in any direction at a crucial moment in any transaction is just as likely as a move in the opposite direction, and whatever moves happen are just as likely to be reversed within a few minutes as not ... its not something that people worry about. At least no one Ive ever transacted with..

Its spelt 'Theft' and No its not, as I said before, intention matters.
For a contract to be upheld in law there must be a 'meeting of minds'.  Since the attacker did something within the contract that was not foreseen or intended to be possible by all parties to it,  there is strong grounds for any of the parties of the contract to petition a court to consider it void. Which they undoubtedly would because, aside for anything else, its automatically invalid for a contract to write terms and conditions that attempt to put it outside of the law.
If this case went to court then the attacker would certainly go to jail for decades, and the contract authors would probably be liable for charges of promoting unauthorized investment vehicles.

Yes, apparently you have decided to redefine the word for the purposes of marketing lightning tech, like many others.
Doesn't make it correct .. simple way to look at it, if you and I open a bidirectional channel and both commit $10 dollars then you send me a lightning transaction that moves your 10 dollars to me, you claim this is instantly confirmed, right?    but if instead of using this transaction to close the channel i d keel over and die unexpectedly and I lose my copy of that transaction ... would my children have access to that 10 dollars you sent me via my will?  
No, they wouldn't, in fact they wouldn't even know about it because it's not until the channel close transaction has been broadcast, and a sufficient number of actual new confirmations have happened that they can actually even see that they have that money.

I've read it and there are many valid points, my issue is simply with the alleged communication mechanism.
If it were possible for the nodes to communicate to the miners through their sheer number, then why is mining even necessary .. surely the nodes could just vote on transaction ordering.
I don't take issue with the fact that the miners are eventually forced by economic incentives to mine what users use, i agree 100% but the miners feedback mechanism for learning what the users use is not node count. Nor can it be because that is easily faked. The feedback mechanism that the users have at their disposal for signalling what they are using is the price of the coin. That is what miners are eventually forced to follow. Economic incentives are at the heart of bitcoin not node software.

Whitepaper no, but his early writings, email responses and forum posts handled the question of network scaling more than satisfactorily. Wether he was god or not is a mute point on which i dont care to speculate but certainly he has been shown to be correct about  all of bitcoins fundamentals to date. The network growth is playing out exactly as he envisiged, including the existence of fanatical small blockers, data center scale mining operations and ever increasing prices that correlate with the size of the user base.

You absolutely wont make a reliable grand a year.
You might break even and make a small profit before the difficulty increases so much that your miner is using more in electricity than it mines.  So then you'll have to shut off your machine ... but then a few months later bitcoin price might rocket and it might be worth turning it back on for a few weeks / months until the difficulty rises again and prices you out.. There's really no way of knowing how much it'll earn because it depends on how many other miners there are and what the price does, both of which are unpredictable.
Whether you profit or not, it definitely wont be a case that you can make x per year easily.  You really ought to only do this if you genuinely want to support decentralization in the network and have a cheap source of power and can definitely get the latest hardware delivered without any delays, and can tolerate it humming away and generating heat in your house.

I was missing your point, because I never would have imagined anyone could be so far removed from reality as to try to make such a point.
Your quite right, anyone can fork in his basement ... they might even select a validity ruleset agreeable to a huge chunk of the userbase of the prefork chain ... But as the second user, why on earth would I join his fork rather than simply set up my own?  Anyone can fork, but if you don't have the user base on side first your coin is not valuable to anyone and hence their is no mining incentive.
Do you have any idea how many coins have already tried what you are suggesting? And how many lasted longer than the amount of time it took for their creators to get bored of waiting for people to join them? And of those that did manage to muster up a tiny user base ( of mostly friends of the creator), how many survived more than a few weeks? Those that didn't change POW were attacked and killed of by Bitcoins miners. Those that did and eventually made it onto an exchange had their price dumped into the ground by prefork holders.  Just scan through history on BitcoinTalk its all there ...

Not at all .... there is a lot of people who hold a lot of bitcoins who have said they will dump if the block size is increased with a hard fork.  At the same time there is a lot of holders who were expecting block size increases as necessary in line with Satoshi's vision for scaling the system.
We are clearly approaching a crunch one way or the other because the Hong Kong agreement is almost at its deadline, ( or what the majority of miners present assumed was the agreed deadline ) recent tweets from pool operators suggest they re expecting something soon as per the agreement and its quite apparent that there is no chance of any consensus amongst core devs to implement a block size hard fork .. at the same time, fees are rising, network is congested, other coins are getting merchant and mainstream finance acceptance .. Not sure what can happen from here except disappointing one large chunk of the user base or the other .. in which case there will be dumps.

If I had enough mining power I could fork bitcoin without the nodes agreeing with me and here is how it would play out...
the nodes would disappear off my network, I wouldn't pay attention because nodes don't mean anything to me because I have no way of knowing if they are even real nodes, let alone operated by actual economic actors. then all those node owners would figure out a way to introduce replay protection, into their side of the chain if necessary,  then they would figure out a way to continue extending their chain, then evenutally they would convince an exchange to allow trading between their fork and mine. Then they would dump my side of the fork and the value of my block rewards would plummet, then I would take notice and switch my miners back over to the more profitable chain that the user base have communicated that they value, through a mechanism that i can actually believe in. As opposed to one that is incredibly easy to syble attack.
That is the economic incentives playing out as bitcoin was designed to work.

I should have stopped reading here considering the blatency of this shameless and ridiculous comment, however


How exactly do you know this? Even if it were provable ( which it is not ) why do you think that is a useful measure of centralisation?   To give you the benefit of the doubt, the only possible risk this entails is a state level intervention by the Chinese government. If they were going to do that they would have done it already and even if they did it would not be a particular problematic not interesting incident. Worst case is they commander the miners and 51% the network. A sustained attack would be incredibly expensive and give them zero gains. It would simply prompt a proof of work change.
@_date: 2017-06-18 04:50:15
You yourself know full well that so called non mining full nodes are a recent invention and Satoshi fully intended for mining nodes to be the only ones that even store a copy of the full blockchain. The idea that non mining full nodes enforce anything on the rest of the network, like i said before, is simply wishful thinking. All a non mining node can do is decide what it accepts as valid on an individual level and decide whether it is going to fork itself away from the most work chain or not. Nodes can only 'enforce' on themselves.  Its a nice idea to believe that somehow, if there are enough of them, they can somehow force the miners to behave but it simply isnt true. The mechanism available for the users of bitcoin to dictate to the miners what they want is price movements. Sell and get out if you dont like what the miners are doing.  No matter how many people fork themselves off from the longest chain in protest at the miners validation policy, it wont affect a single thing because it doesn't give the miners any feedback. How do the miners know  ?  They cant know because nodes are so easily faked. This is kind of why Nakamoto consensus through POW was invented in the first place.

Name one single reliable signal ?


Claims with no evidence, how exactly do big blocks promote centralisation ? .. more importantly how does the larger price that results from larger blocks not encourage more new miners to join ?


Again nonsense, the block reward is set to expire in 2140, if price continues to rise, the VALUE of the block reward can continue to rise until at least 2100 and will serve perfectly well to pay for mining until then.


Well see what happens on 1st August, I'd be happy to put a $100 bet on UASF being a total failure if we can find a third party arbitrator for the bet that we are both happy with. edit - Segwit I don't doubt will eventually activate but through a miner majority mechanism.

Its not a like for like comparison because of the difference in the difficulty adjustment algo.
A bitcoin minority chain would have to manually adjust difficulty pretty sharpish or they would not be able to find any blocks at all. Also, since poloniex has now added EthClassic, the other chain can sell their holdings in to the ground .. this may or may not happen on ethereum because its price was not adversely affected byt he split, bitcoin again would be different, price would be affected by a split and holders of both sides would want to see the other side destroyed because its a threat to the network effects, an exchange offering a rate between 2 sides of a split bitcoin chain would absolutely end up with one of them dying as the majority side sold its minority coins into the ground and miners therefore lost all chance of profit from continually mining it.

Never going to happen, my counterparties buy on LBC and withdraw directly to an address I supply. They won't ever be paying fees like that and even if they did is the same as a bank transfer. International wire takes 3-5 days, a low priority low fee bitcoin transaction would still probably be faster. No alt is as far along the path of achieving stability as btc ( yes it still has a long way to go) and this is a matter of time. I can't therefore store value long term in anything else ... Suppose I receive an alt because it's faster. And cheaper to recieve a payment that way, I still want to move it into bitcoin because of the higher security, better stability etc so I'm then going to end up paying a transaction fee from whatever service I use to convert it ... It's a nice theory but the actual logistics of switching to an alt mean that Bitcoin will always remain ahead.

I have no idea how consensus works ?!
You believe in something that was explicitly excluded from the consensus forming mechanism according to the actual design of bitcoin.
Consensus never meant majority in Bitcoin, Satoshi never intended for so called non mining full nodes to even exist let alone somehow vote on consensus by their mere presence.
Consensus in Bitcoin emerges from the competitive nature of hashing to find the next block. Not reddit polls, reddit troll armies or node counts. Consensus does not need to be sought or gained, it emerges naturally at the chain tip because of the economic incentives of selfish greed and how they are aligned with the production of security for the network.
Really I suggest you go back to the whitepaper.

So many posts that claim capacity is increasing, all of them ignore the reality that people don't want to transfer 'bitcoins'  they want to transfer 'bitcoins equivalent to the sum of X usd'. 
In that sense the lighting networks capacity had dropped dramatically in line with drop in value of Bitcoin, of course this had been partially compensated by people putting more bitcoins in as liquidity but this is expected and compensatory behavior to try to maintain as much as possible the networks ability to transfer USD value.

Nodes don't define consensus, the simply choose whether or not to accept the blocks they are offered on a individual level. The idea that cumulatively the nodes can force the miners to behave a certain way is simply wishful thinking. Economic activity, price movements on exchanges possibly can do that but nodes.. no and we should be thankful of it because nodes are a dime a dozen, any script kiddie with a credit card could spin up enough to double the total with an afternoons work.

Speechless eh, that's also the same thing that happens to people when they have been shown to be wrong and have exhausted all the ways they have at their disposal to argue their side.
What do you think Satoshi intended then when he said that eventually users would be using SPV only and the chain itself would only be being stored in datacenters owned by operators of large mining operations ? How does your version of the consensus forming mechanism operate under those conditions? which were invisaged by the designer of the system according to his early writings..
@_date: 2017-06-18 05:00:02
What has this got to do with my comment? .. of course I know that mining has to be decentralised ...
Satoshi stated early on that eventually mining will be done on specialised hardware in datacenters, he knew full well that every user being a miner was only ever temporary, but there is no reason to believe, as some would have it, that that is somehow antithetical to decentralisation.

The alt coin flippening is and always will be a myth. Until Bitcoin fails for some other reason it will always be so far ahead in terms of network effects that alts are essentially invisible to all but die hard crypto fans. All new entrants to the space start with Bitcoin, some users are into Alts as well but because Bitcoin Is the common denominator for everyone that's where the economic activity goes and that's what really matters.  
I use Bitcoin for 3 use cases regularly, store of value long term, phone credit through bitrefill and receiving international payments. Apart from the third, there is not a single alt works and Imagine the hassle id have to go through to receive my payments with an alt, it took me long enough to convince and train my counterparties how to send it to me in bitcoin....

I'm not sure why you think I believe in the chinese mining monopoly theory. I know that mining is a fully anonymous activity and anyone that claims to be sure of knowing anything about the distribution of mining hardware amongst its owners ought to be re-educated or viewed with suspicion.  Chinese or not, BIP 148 has essentially no mining support and any miners that signals it is probably simply posturing because they would have to be seriously nuts to risk all their profits on such an unlikely gamble. Id be prepared to put a fairly substantial bet on the UASF being a total non starter and not even getting to 10 blocks without a further fork of some kind being required.
@_date: 2016-07-02 21:47:53
OP is mostly wrong. Any fork that doesn't have majority support from the economy's users will quickly die. True but a fork that has the support of 51% of miners and 51% of the economic activity will quickly render the other chain obsolete.
For a minority chain to stay alive it requires miners who are prepared to throw away money for nothing on a dysfunctional chain.
Exchanges are facing possibly very expensive legal challenges and will likely have to allow users to withdraw on whatever chain they like, meaning that exchanges will have to support both chains, while the fork is yet unresolved.

With the amount of changes necessary to maintain a chain without the support of the miners, you would effectively be creating a new coin.
Your idea that it doesn't really matter what the difficulty will be changed to does not make it any easier to come to an agreement with the rest of the user base. Any body who suggested any number will face claims that their suggested number will be to high or too low or give them unfair advantage in terms of the first few block rewards.
Of course the discussion will also be sabotaged by miners and other coins, look at the mess of a conversation we have had for 4 years over a simple variable like block size. The fact that you think you can simply do a difficulty reset/adjustment demonstrates that you haven't really thought through the impacts of that.

"If the network becomes very large, like over 100,000 nodes, this is what we'll use to allow common users to do transactions without being full blown nodes.  At that stage, most users should start running client-only software and only the specialist server farms keep running full network nodes, kind of like how the usenet network has consolidated."

Most people have bitcoin so yes they want the price to go up .. but have they got enough bitcoin ? If not they want the price to come down so they can buy more before it goes up.
For day traders their is greater profit potential if the price is lower. Because eg, $10,000 spent on btc at $500 gives you 20 coins, if price moves $50 dollars you can make $50*20 = $1000 dollars. However $10,000 spent on btc at $1000 gives you 10 coins so for the same price movement of $50 dollars, now you only make $500 dollars... For many pro traders, a lower price gives them more opportunity to profit. Also of course they can profit from price drop through short positions so when it goes down.
The market is made up of people who profit when price rises, other people who profit when price declines and a final group of bitcoin that actually use bitcoin as money, which theoretically care less about price movements but do put on some upward pressure on the price by reducing the available supply of coin.

To be honest, its just what I imagine is the most likely .. I don't think there is a turkish exchange, is there? Even is there is I don't think banks are able to facilitate transfers in such a short time, so the only possible  trades that the price can be based off otherwise is localbitcoin and its kin and or money that people already had on the exchanges.  To be honest, If my country were in the first few hours of a military coup and there was a curfew in effect, I would neither be arranging localbitcoin cash trades nor logging into my bitcoin exchange account .. I'd be getting home, possibly swinging past the store and the cashpoint machine en route ..
Also I know that the some popular price feeds are based off the USD price converted at the spot forex rate for another currency and passed off as the bitcoin price in that country. eg preev's prices are all based off the USD Price converted to other currencies
So yeah, possibly wrong but that's my hunch.

I don't think you understood my point.  Nearly 3 years ago sidechains were proposed and nearly 3 years later still no one has actually figured out they can be made to work in a decentralised trustless fashion like bitcoin.  In order for a 2 way peg to work trustlessly, bitcoin needs to understand the side chain and be able to check it's block chain.. this is a huge change that is required to bitcoin on a per side chain basis.  So if you think it's easy to "spin up a sidechain" id challenge you to go right ahead. But unless you can convince the rest of the ecosystem to make big and fundamental changes to bitcoin, purely to accommodate your specific sidechain, then it is nothing other than any other alt coin.  Good luck with that consensus.

Go ahead then, assuming you have support of the entire user base to divorce yourselves from the existing miners let's ee how you get on with the incredibly easy discussions and coming to agreement on a new difficulty value, Mining algo, forking block height and to what degree you are going to honour the existing utxo set.
Of course there won't be any problems generated by people who believe the difficulty will be to high and advantage preprepared miners or to low and cause a dysfunctional chain. Neither will there be people who have mining power ready for a particular algo trying to sway that discussion in their favour, or those who want to prevent that very thing. No chance of problems agreeing on a forking block height, because the won't be anybody who wants a little more time to prepare their mining hardware, and everyone will be completely in agreement to honour the existing utxos because there is no fear of dissenters from the old chain purposefully crashing the price.
It's incredibly easy to fork like you say, but to fork with success that result in a healthy functional secure chain with a committed base of users ..... it's effectively impossible without first getting complete consensus on a whole variety of massively controversial points. It took Bitcoin 4 years to arrive at a compromise on just one of those, and it's still not assured. That's called decentralisation.
@_date: 2017-06-20 00:41:51
You still banging this drum .. I thought I explained this to you the other day.
Consensus is not something that is 'defined' in bitcoin, it is something that is arrived at through mining. The most work chain is the consensus.  Validity is defined on an individual level and no one, not nodes or miners can force their validity rules on anyone else.  This results in a possibility of multiple chains and that is why we have the economic incentives that underlie the whole thing, that pressures miners to look to users for what they consider to be validity through the feedback mechanism of price movements. (not node count)
@_date: 2017-06-24 13:16:06
What you are basically saying is that if the miners don't do what the users want the users will start a new coin.

First there is absolutely no way the UASF chain is ever going to overtake the main chain. The chances diminish exponentially with each passing block ..So my next comment is completely pointless but ...
If by some outrageous breach of all that is rational, logical, sensible and in compliance with the known laws of the universe the UASF side did look as if it was going to catch up and overtake the main chain, there is no way on earth that the user base of the main chain would permit it to be re orged out of existence, they would simply hard/soft fork to include some re org protections and the chain would continue as before.

That would apply, yes, to mining nodes. However I was referring to to the fact that actualy nodes cant 'enforce' anything on the rest of the network, only on themselves. If I decide that my node will only accept transactions worth more then X bitcoins doesnt mean that im only going to be sent transactions of that value, but I do have the ability to delete anything that doesnt conform to my desires. That is effectively the same thing the UASFers are attempting, they believe that if enough of them agree to only accept certain blocks, that it will somehow force the miners to produce those blocks.  Actually they are going to discover that miners dont put any faith in node count or reddit posts to provide feedback about what the user base wants because both of those are easily gamed. The miners receive their feedback from the market through the mechanism of price movements.
