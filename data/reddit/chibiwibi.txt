I actually bought uranium once.  Now I'm on a list somewhere.

sure I'll get right on that 5 star review because you said so.  Fucktard.

I get that it takes money, but there is so much free stuff out there... Maybe I'm just cheap.

yah, and it sucks for porn, try Bing. You might be surprised.
@_date: 2015-09-24 00:54:09
dude who downvoted me: porn is free, just Bing it...
@_date: 2015-09-24 00:46:14
who the fuck pays for porn?

Man, that site doesn't look like a scam at all.

whats up with link shortener?
edit: nevermind, I just read the rules.
@_date: 2013-09-06 18:00:40
wow man, Thanks!  I didn't know you could do that on reddit.  I'll get started on that reading and pay it forward ;)
edit: Realized that sounded sarcastic, its not... I am just really excited about this whole thing.

security suggestions.  There was a post a few weeks ago about a guy that put 50K of his savings into Bitcoin without really doing the research,  lots of posts about what he did wrong, but I didn't fully follow them

I hate it when people quote stats like this.  It should say: "6% of people polled didn't think Bitcoin was any of the other choices, so they picked Xbox Game.  Had they not had this choice, they would have chosen something else."

I see your point.  Welp, BFL Jalapenos go for about $200 and they do 5GH/s, where as the USB miner does 1/15 of that for $11 (8.99+2.99 shipping). So to get the same processing power you'd spend ~$165, and still wouldn't break even for months *at the current difficulty*  Oh, and it goes up every 2 weeks.  Seriously, spending any amount of money on mining is by and large a poor investment compared with just buying bitcoins.

You won't see a return on investment from it.  The cost to run it and the speed at which it runs are just too low.  This one does .333 GH/s.  A BFL Jalapeno does 5GH/s and makes about .01 BTC/day and they won't break even for months.   You'd be better off calculating the energy cost to run it and invest 10x that in BTC.
