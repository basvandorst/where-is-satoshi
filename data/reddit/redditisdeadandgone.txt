It's coming from bankers trying to crash the market.  Just like what happened during 20k Bitcoin.  Youre a fool if you don't think the banks are not aware of the threat of Bitcoin and are doing everything in their power.  Including spreading FUD on subs like these to try and get people to devest.

This is nothing.  Start doing research on pedogate and the cabal.  Those are mental scars.

I'm saying the real inflation is not as low as the projected inflation rate makes it seem.  Much of the inflation is siloed in home costs.

Yep USD is seen as the baseline.  Obviously people don't understand the FED if they think that USD is some how the ideal currency.  Constantly inflated, over-leveraged, based on nothing, massive reserves over seas based on collapsing Petro dollar, everyone switching away from global reserve status of dollars...
Need I say more.  BTC might not be the future, but one of the cryptos will and BTC will be a big one just because of brand recognition.
Only a fool thinks in USD.  Don't be a fool.

Your looking backwards at a system that has steadily lost value over time. Inflation is like a hockey stick at some point it shoots up.  I'd recommend looking up Mike Moloney's secret history of money for a more in-depth analysis.

Not all cultures are the same.  You are projecting  western values on to middle eastern goat farmer and tribal low IQ Africans.  Your globalism Utopia is the same Utopian thinking that has caused millions of death in the last 100 years. 
 Bitcoin is great and will be a major blow to the hegemony, but that does not mean no borders open immigration is even close to the agenda of crypto.  Bitcoin is about destroying Fiat not about globalism.  In fact fiat is globalism and therefore Bitcoin is more anti globalists than not.
I have no doubt that your indoctrination is thicker than my post however and it will fall on deaf ears.  It takes experience to break through the conditioning.  I have had my full helping of dealing with these people and I am now fully aware that whatever nation allows in vast quantities of these people will collapse.

 Globalism creates conflict because people like you are willing to push people like me against the wall.  Stripping of us of our rights and freedoms.  You will not survive the future you seek because people like me will win. You will not have the military, you will not have the police, you will not have the food, you will starve and die.  If you attempt to take by force what is not yours you will be shot.  People like you have no place in free societies as you only seek to impose your world view on others.
You do not belong in cyrpto go back to your fiat because that is the very people who push this globalism, The fiat bankers the global cabal.

They are your opinions not facts.  Everything you believe is based off a false premise.  The Russian narrative is a hoax.  Russia does not have the power to do what they are accused of. They are literally blamed for anything and everything that goes against the globalist agenda.  The reality is the fool globalists are trying to stem the tide of the grassroots nationalist wave that is sweeping away gloablists forever using propaganda pumped through unscrupulous captured MSM outlets where truth is only an annoyance on for the pursuit of power.
You are a joke.

The left are the ones who see foreigners as people incapable of fending for themselves in their own nation.  The left are the dangerous ones, because everything the left accuses the right of they are the ones guilty of.  The left projects.

If you're trying to get Normies to take it seriously as a coin and increase adoption I disagree with the premise.
  If your trying to keep the price high, which in my opinion, is irrelevant because real value is created through adoption and mainstream normalization, then you have a point.  
I'm looking for generalized usage, and darknet human trafficking AND drug use is not helping the Bitcoin brand.  Mom and pops don't want to touch something they believe will go to funding the suffering of another whether it is true or not.  
As a community we should have a publicly perceived stance against these actions.  Even if it hurts us in the short term to spread adoption to the masses.

No you are insane you have redefined words to fit your belief system.  China is a threat, but not as much a threat as globalism.  Globalism is burning down your house before the enemy does.

Yellow vests have been in Brussels and even Tiawan. You don't know what you are talking about and are highly misinformed.  Dems won through massive voter fraud. The MSM is controlled and are globalist puppets.  If you get your information from them you will never know the truth.
President Trump won 3 more seats in the Senate despite illegals and massive voter fraud.  Balsonaro won in the highly socialist country of Brazil.  Salvini in Italy, Merkel is losing support, Macron is about to resign, the Eastern European nation are led by nationalist with massive support, Sebastian Kurz in Austria and this is just the beginning.   Globalism is dead even George Soros says so.  The time to panic is now.

I'm bitter, because now I'm asked by a man who lives in an ivory tower that I must sacrifice more.  You are a threat to my children and their future.  You are a dangerous idealogue.
You are not winning and you will soon see how much you are about to lose of your precious globalism.  The future is nationalism.  I'm just glad that when I see the hammer fall, I can think of you crying into your soy milk.

You assume you are the majority but you are not just the highly vocal hysterical left.  I'd rather be a racist then a globalist.  Globalists are just retards who think that people are plug and play cogs in a machine.
Their claims about diversity are false their is no diversity that is allowed on the left only state based oppression on all those that refuse to share the same ideaology.  State enforced moral relativism.  No one is allowed to critisize the barbaric religion that is Islam or the parasitic immigrants coming in mass that vote for more leftism.

Anyone who uses an exchange.  I'd assume some unscrupulous wallets use a similar approach and do backdoor trading and selling for increased profits.
The exchanges in China are especially bad for this racket.  You can see by the  impossible trade volumes what they are up to.
It's why it's important for us to pull out our coins on the 3rd, to clean up the markets, destroying the bad actors.  Which is all of them.

Not if the market crashes so hard that people never trust the derivative system again.
All it takes is the consumer demanding the physical along with outlawing of all non physical trades, including crypto codes.  It would defang the money manipulators and fruadersters.  The impetus for this change can be created through pain.
The collapse is coming and nothing can stop it.  As Warren Buffett says "Derivatives are weapons of mass financial destruction."

All cryptos and stocks are artificially price controlled through derivative trading.  If you don't know this yet it may be time to understand that gold and silver are not the only ETF controlled commodities and that everything is controlled by these same ETFs by another name.
Look at the trade volumes coming out of Chinese crypto exchanges.  High frequency trading of derivatives being applied to the actual value of the underlying currency.  The whole system is fucked and the regulators are in on it.
At this point only a total derivative wipe out can fix the markets.  People need to realize if you don't own the paper stock or silver bullion or cryptokey. You DO NOT own the commodity.
Just ask Venezuela what happened to their gold.
@_date: 2018-12-23 00:36:32
I don't disagree in the fashion that you presented.  The only point I take interest with being scale.  2008 will be nothing compared to the kind of crash we are headed to.
The animosity that will be generated will be so large as to, with our current white house, be able to implement dramatic reforms to the system.
Sure these reforms will be dismantled over time, but some is better than nothing and the battle against corruption is eternal.

You are more right then you know. 
 They were planning on a nuclear war with Russia.  That was the purpose of Uranium One.  Why they sold it to Russia but also some to Iran with the purposes of framing Russia.
If you remember before the election Clinton's plan for a no fly zone above Syria.  Russia was, at the time, flying planes in Russia.  Hillary's posture was highly aggressive and would have catapaulted us into war.  Thank God President Trump won or America would be a wasteland.
