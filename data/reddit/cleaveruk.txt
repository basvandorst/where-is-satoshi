yes its incredible for sure, calm before the perfect storm coming for bitcoin in the middle of 2016.
in the next recession when governments start directly confiscating wealth with bail ins (instead of indirectly with inflation and bail outs) people will be trying to secure their wealth, and lets not talk about gold its to impraticle to use for any spending and if its stored centrally someware its up for grabs aswell. 
Also the US gov seized all private gold in the 30's in the last period of great depression, they will do it again if they 'need' too.
Increasingly socalist governments will need to seize alot of wealth to fulfil their "free stuff for everyone if you vote for us" promises

sweep them before someone else does. then contact the owner and give 50% back is what I would do.
you can include a message in the transaction with how to contact you. use a burner email.
it might seem immoral but most people who found that would take 100% and one of those people will find it eventually so he gets to keep 50% instead of 0%

its quite likely that [coinjoin]( will be implimented at some point greatly increasing anonymity. 
Obviously this will make governments and banks hate bitcoin even more so it needs to reach a much higher user base before it can be. 
Also sidechains will probably provide anonymity somehow although I cant describe how but as with anything in this world, when there is demand there will be supply and the incentive (demand) already exists for anonymity. 
I dont really know what your idea of a darknet bank would be? a lender? a place to store bitcoins? a place to donate to the Clinton Foundation? Maybe you mean a place to exchange fiat for bitcoins anonymously?

about 10% mainly because I need to hold stock as I am a bitcoin broker.
I am well placed to buy more if the price starts to rocket as I have alot of fiat on an exchange, no open positions though because i'm on holiday (although I cant stop checking this reddit lol) 
100 trillion, is approx value of all current financial assets 
if 1% of the worlds wealth gets held in bitcoin thats 1 trillion. 21million bitcoin will ever exist
1,000,000,000,000 / 21,000,000 = 47619.04761904762 so if bitcoin ever holds 1% of the worlds wealth they will be worth $47,619 each so I would say they are massively undervalued at $224.36 
Also worth noting alot of coins are already lost (ie in a lost wallet with no backup or lost private keys)
The question is when to buy in on a large scale, for people who are not into crunching numbers id say just drop 10% of an investment portfolio and sit on them for a decade.

yeah its some kind of private blockchain thing, still a step in the right direction. once private blockchains start being used and then get hacked or go wrong it will emphasise why they need to have a trustless currency built ontop of them with proof of work hashing instead of some centralized currency generation method

@_date: 2015-12-31 12:22:32
all an ASIC is is a chip dedicated to a specific type of computing, so no matter what hashing is used its possible to develop an ASIC for it, the question is would it be cheaper to fund development of an ASIC or just buy more CPU's.
maybe if the hashing algo changed every month then it wouldnt be worth making an ASIC.
ASIC are used in everything, from network switches to your kitchen fridge 
also the expense of producing advanced ASIC's makes the network resistant to attack, nowon can turn their super computer onto mining bitcoin and threaten its security, and if they developed their own ASICs they are better of mining with them that trying to disrupt the network, its the genius of this whole system and why private blockchains wont work also because they require trust which is what makes legacy payments so expensive in the first place.

How We're Trying To Change The Public Perception Of Bitcoin
Jonathan Chester
Had you ever heard of Bitcoin before seeing the title to this article? What do you know about it? That it’s a way to buy illegal drugs? That the CEO died? That it’s gone bankrupt? There are grains of truth in each of these statements. Those of us with going concerns that aren’t engaged in crime or falling into ruin have to cope with the perceptions those grains create.
Released in 2009, Bitcoin is still very new, as far as network-centric applications go. The blockchain and the peer to peer connections used can be compared to other network applications like DNS, the domain name system, which was released in 1984, and which is still being refined and extended today. Immaturity in blockchain based currencies like Bitcoin is clear; the seven transactions per second and half hour verification times are issues that will have to be addressed as volume increases.
There have been spectacular, tragic failures in these first years as Bitcoin has spread, and these events, coupled with sometimes hasty journalism, have led to beliefs that are only loosely connected to reality.
Autumn Radke, CEO of First Meta, died at age twenty eight after she jumped from the balcony of her 25th story apartment in Singapore. Echoing the manner of death of stock brokers and bank executives during the crash of 1929, reporters unfamiliar with the industry cut the name First Meta out of the narrative and dramatized Radke’s tragic death the loss of “the Bitcoin CEO”.
Mt. Gox was a site associated with Magic: The Gathering, a trading card game, where players traded cards in a manner similar to stocks. Like Ebay, which started as a site about the Ebola virus, Mt. Gox stumbled into a burgeoning need for Bitcoin related services. When the company collapsed in February of 2014, 850,000 Bitcoins worth $450 million had vanished. This was an eye catching number, but less than 10% of the total market capitalization at the time. The media again dramatized this event, billing it as the bankruptcy of all Bitcoin, rather than lucidly exploring the need for regulation and insured exchanges.
The biggest criminal case thus far involving Bitcoin was Silk Road, a darknet drug market whose owner, Ross Ulbricht, made $80 million on $1.2 billion in transactions over fifteen months. He is currently serving a life sentence for six attempts to hire hitmen to deal with problematic users of the market. Since then there have been several Silk Road look-alikes that have either been taken down or run away with everyone’s money, with half a dozen competitors remain in operation today.
All of this adds up to a multifaceted perception problem for those of us who are operating legitimate businesses that are dependent on Bitcoin. Both trustworthiness and terminology matter.
These problems became painfully clear for us at San Francisco’s Launch Festival last March. We had a booth with a big Bitwage banner and many people paused, intrigued by a service that is faster, easier, and cheaper than banks for international payroll. All went well until they asked about the underlying mechanism. When one of us said “Bitcoin” their smiles turned to frowns, as they tried to balance the exciting features we offer with prior mistaken reporting.
@_date: 2015-12-28 15:21:10
actually its quite the opposite. miners want full blocks so people compete for space in blocks with higher fees (that the miners earn from)
the bitcoin ecosystem as a whole needs to be able to support more transactions if it ever wants to be a truly global payment network.
@_date: 2015-12-25 05:09:43
they are not doing that because by doing soo they would legitimize bitcoin and accelerate their own decline.
if I was running a bank i would try to compete through a trojan horse type of attack, lobbying and controlling regulators to make bitcoin unusable or seem unsafe. imagine if the whole world was using BTC and it only takes a few thousand $ per hour to cripple the whole network (spam attack)

Tbh nodes should really only be run on servers, currently the bitcoin-qt client counts as a full node now but due to them only accepting 8 connections they are more like leaches tbh.
I run a full node on an ubuntu server, I get free hosting but I really think it should be incentivised somehow. The problem is how to do that....
If it was done on pure bandwidth it could be exploited by just deleting the blockchain from a pool of nodes and then uploading just to them over and over.
Also creating more bitcoins to pay node operators creates more inflation which is bad for obvious reasons.
Increasing the transaction fee slightly and then paying this to node operators might be a  small incentive. I think most nodes though are run on servers with space capacity, by people who have a business hosting whatever and use their excess hardware and bandwidth to run a node.
Increasing the node count is essential to reduce the time it takes to get 6 confirmations, if BTC is ever to become a viable method of payment it needs to take seconds (not minutes) to confirm a transaction.

nothing is free, you pay for facebook by letting them sell your data and target advertise you for example.
content creators getting paid by the readers through micropayments lets them focus their content on the end user and not on what will generate the most ad clicks 
I absolutely cannot stand watching adverts, but when I watch TV I am forced too because there is no other way to pay for a single episode or a single sport match, instead I must pay £40-£70 a month in the UK for Sky Digital which has monopolized most of the sport.

Its going down because alot of exchanges now allow traders to short  BTC. And alot of BTC holders are noobs and its easy with just a few hundred thousand dollars to crash the price a few % and then let all the noobs panick sell.
This is in contrast to established markets where most of shares or whatever asset is being traded is held by people who know what they're doing.
They will keep shorting and keep forcing the price down to make profit. Like most day traders they couldnt care less what happens to the asset, only what money they will make.
This coupled with early adopters cashing out and all the miners who bought expensive kit in the boom trying to recoup losses.

super slow in compared to what? its broadcast instantly and 1 confirmation takes 10 minutes on average (slightly less when the difficulty is increasing) that to any address anywhere on earth. the cost of double spending in 1 confirmation is hundreds of millions (if not over a billion) investment so small transactions dont even need to wait for a confirmation.
Its lightning fast compared to other payment methods except some of the shitcoins.

requiring human oversight to validate blocks is not a great idea. if it did things would just centralize to areas with cheap labour costs.
captcha doesnt prevent bots, only crappy bots. I think someone even wrote a bot that when it cant break a captcha it pays a human (in bitcoin) to solve the captcha for it.
my opinion is this, their may be some way to increase capacity with clever engineering but we are not there yet (segwit isnt enough) 
this whole debate is silly to me, hard disks are getting cheaper over time and they will keep getting cheaper, I dont think we will lose very many nodes even if it went to 20mb per block, nodes are going to become more and more centralized over time, we probably need to incentivize node operators somehow, probably by paying them fees for transactions.

Completely agree, I work in IT security and don't feel comfortable keeping my life savings in bitcoin at the moment, my Grandad doesn't stand a chance! 
There was so many hundreds of millions of VC money into the bitcoin space last year, in 6-12-18 months their products will start coming to market and lets see what they come up with, the backend is excellent, anyone with a bit of knowledge knows its far superior to other payment methods and money transfer services, the problem now is usability and lets hope someone figures it out.

its funny how any bad news for bitcoin is jumped on by mainstream media and good news is almost never mentioned unless its extremely good news.

@_date: 2016-01-08 19:41:01
I live and am based in the UK, I am a UK bitcoin seller. Its my full time job now.
I started off with personal accounts, I have had 5 closed due to fraudulent payments (on 4/5 occasions the sender of £ sterling either got hacked or pretended they got hacked in order to recerse the bank transfer (after they got the bitcoins ofc)) one of them was closed because the volume exceeded what was deemed accessible for a personal account.
I now have 3 business accounts, I could not of course tell the banks what the accounts are being used for but they are still open after 1 year which is great. I did try to open bank accounts for bitcoin selling, all were declined.
I even got a business bank account approved in EUR at a bank in Estonia, I had to fly there to sign paperwork, bought plane ticket a few weeks in advance, 1 day before my flight I got a call telling me they changed their decision and wont be opening my account, goodbye £250.
I feel once some basic regulations are passed banks will start opening accounts, especially smaller banks, the problem in the UK is there is a banking cartel who run the FPS (faster payment service) which is basically near instant payments between UK banks. The smaller banks need to be sponsored by the large ones to get access to it, its essential to compete in the UK. I know that a new disruptive bank (Metro Bank) was told by its FPS sponsor (Barclays) that if it opened any bitcoin accounts knowingly they would cut them off from FPS.
If I was a large bank I would do the same but they cant hold back the tide forever, the question is when legislation is passed will it be so expensive to comply with it will force the little guys to go underground and operate cash exchanges or will it be accessible to small business.

I think its very likely retailers would operate their own off-chain networks maybe with LN to suit their needs, all backed by BTC but more specialized.
any big retailer like wallmart or amazon using it would be amazing as they would probably force their suppliers to accept it. ultimatly if they dont have to pay 1% to cash it out they will save huge sums of money.

So what do you consider a different protocol? Any change that requires a hard fork? In that case we are nog using the origional bitcoin as it has been hard forked before.

right now much less than WU, but it is prepared to scale its just not a massive issue at the moment. 
Most of the market cap in bitcoin is not because of its use as a currency, its store of value / hedge against inflation etc. The scalability and speed issues will be solved with side chains and transaction compression in various forms.

Ohh crap, bitcoin is going to die for the 99th time guys.
Centralization is a problem, the ASIC miners are now at 16nm which is the same as intel / AMD chips etc. Now we have hit that quite hard limit the chinese rapid manufacturing foundries lose their edge.
Remember the miners also know that if they get seized by the Chinese gov then all their profit goes to 0, they also dont want this to happen. They will sell their designs and equipment to 3rd parties to mine with in different countries.
Now we have hit the 16nm rating it is electricity cost that will determine the ideal location for mining farms. Datacenters in the arctic circle work well, low PUE ratings and cheap green electricity in the case of iceland. 
We are too centralized now:  but this has happened before (it it will happen again)

No it isn't the slight premium on GBP is the same as ever, the spead between the global price (measured by something like the XBX index) and the GBP price would get bigger if there was alot of demand coming from the UK. (There is capital flight though indicated by the weaker £)
I am a full time broker here and there is no noticeable volume jump. Its possible huge discrete OTC trades are happening but I don't think so either, it would have gotten around the community here which is very small. 
Contrary to all the doomsday scenarios and panic caused by monkey brain shamans premonitions the EU and / or the world is not going to implode if the UK leaves the EU. I think we are about to enter another recession at the minimum, depression likely regardless but thats a whole other topic. 
The single currency might suffer and maybe some countries will go back to their national currency..... Greece cannot survive using the euro, they either need to ditch it or the EU entirely. It is actificially low helping mainly Germany which coincidently has the most  bargaining power being the strongest economy by far. 
This is just the economic hit-men getting to the end of the most recent cycle of unsustainable debt burdens and privatised state assets.

and whats the problem with that? for an individual this is a good thing. Maybe not for governments with huge notational debts.
the trick they are pulling is trying to call CPI a measure of inflation, real inflation is measured by how much the money supply is expanding. CPI is a measure of a particular set of goods (which is not even publicised) but its kept low so public sector wages / pensions / healthcare spending etc tied to it dont need to be increased at the real rate of inflation.

exactly, how many people use bitcoin core as their main wallet now? thats why node count is dropping.
yes nodes will become more expensive but if volunteers are not doing enough then they can be incentiveised easily. I host a node because I get free hosting at work, if the blocksize went to 8MB the hard disk would be full in a little over a year but so what?
Has anyone even really had the depate how many are needed? of course specalized companies will offer the service to other companies. no need to be jack off all trades companies outsource minor roles to specialist companies all the time.
to be honest in an ideal world the people with 1000's of bitcoins from the early days just sitting on them waiting for the price to skyrocket need to spend a bit to collectively improve the network and not just sit on their ass all day waiting for the moon launch........ game theory type rationality means they dont though.

I think there are too likely scenariois
1. Central banks cant really lower interest rates any more, they will probable secure government bonds and pay them off with high interest creating massive inflation causing their currencies to depreciate against all others. BTC is about 10% a year now and thats going to half next year.
2. People will look for a store of value that is easily transactable, bitcoin could be this thing or just physical cash of their chosen currency but that will be hard to get hold off.
bitcoin has a few major problems now, 
1. not new user friendly, its quite alien to most people having to be in charge of their own money. most people are happy to pay their bank (through fees even if there is no account fee, or the profit the bank makes on their money)

VC funding was ~550million 2014, this year its already more and thats only publicly disclosed amounts. when these apps start coming to market lets see what happens.
Yes whales do control this market but thats because the market cap is so low, less than 5 billion....
yes bitcoin is massively inflationary but it becomes less so over time, remember most fiat is also massively inflationary and forget CPI's real inflation is measured by the amount of money being created compared to the amount currently in circulation. 
bitcoin is still very much in its infancy, not ready for maintsteam adoption at all. A friend of mine finally decided he wanted to buy a bitcoin, he asked me where he should keep it (ie online wallet, phone wallet, PC wallet etc) and I didnt have a good answer for him.
Hardware wallets will come down in price over time due to economies of scale and manufacturing efficiency increases. I think the best solution for most people is to keep spending amounts on their online / phone app and bulk of wealth on hardware wallets but the cost of hardware wallets is quite high and telling a person who is only just coming around to buying a bitcoin that they need to spend 0.5 bitcoin on a new piece of hardware they didnt know existed in order to secure it doesnt really make sense.
Most of the people into bitcoin now mostly fall into a few categories
1. Techies
2. Finance interested folks
3. Libertarians who want away from debt slavery fiat money
4. Drug users and similar who want the pseudonymity

im subbed to this guy, watch almost every video and he is a massive bitcoin advocate and ofc takes donations
This is their BTC address 1Fd8RuZqJNG4v56rPD1v6rgYptwnHeJRWs (which can be found here: 
bit silly blaming the greek people, they were duped. their government spent like crazy with cheap credit and now the countries assets are being siezed in exchange for euros (that the ECB is currently printing out of thin air at 6bn EUR / month)
@_date: 2016-02-12 03:51:53
negitive rates will first be applied on banks which park their funds in government bonds. at the moment a bank can borrow at 0.5% and then buy a gov bond (not necessarily UK) around 2% pa.
so at the moment banks have run out of quality borrowers to lend too so the governments are trying to force them to lend to less credit worthy borrowers (sound familier? 2008 anynone?)
the problem is right now some central banks are loosening, ECB /BOJ and other EU banks that have currencies roughly pegged to the Euro. while the fed just raised rates which was a total mistake. they raised because they were saying they would all year and didnt want to lose credibility but now they are caught with their pants down, needed to lower but would look stupid so cant.
so now everyone is buying US gov bonds because the yield is still quite good so the USD keeps getting stronger, meaning US companies cant export and most commodities are priced in USD aswell so they are going down by comparison.
when commodities go down, producers produce more because they are already spending that revenue, more productions means price goes down so here we are with commodities crashing everywhere.
could that with lower consumer demand because consumers are already in as much debt as they can afford.
interest rates being 1% negitive will hurt banks, any more than that might be carried onto consumers.
what will happen is more cheap credit and lending to lower credit people will inflate assets like houses for a short time but the bubble will eventually pop. look at house prices in Copenhagen as a case study, 20% pa is not sustainable its waiting to pop.
very clever by the banks, people put all their life savings into over inflated assets and then pop goes the bubble and the lenders (ie banks) seize the assets and like magic transfer their customers life savings onto their balance sheets, with money they borrowed from their customers (through inflation / low interest rates) using their customers deposits as collateral!
central bankers like Yellen and Draghi will say "we didnt see it coming" "nowon could have predicted this" but do you really think they got where they are being that stupid?
no, they are very clever and have this all figured out.
ohh yeah, and if their plan fails dont worry because tax payers will bail them out, and they will bail in by raiding their customers deposits.

I think this is more public though that they are manipulating things rather than raising them with spam.
It would be harder to claim their alt-chain coin is needed because fees are too high on the main chain if they are publicly manipulating fees higher on the main chain.
This way they could achieve it a backhanded way and get a significant amount back in mining fees.

with this solution you will obviously have to convert to EUR first and then do a SEPA transfer. Most UK banks charge ridiculous fees (upto 5%) to do this conversion. 
If you have an EUR account you could do GBP &gt; EUR with transferwise and then SEPA from your EUR account.
Im a UK broker and can convert any amount of GBP into BTC for you at 2% above the spot price. We could do this once per month on payday, I have a few other buyers who do this monthly. If you are interested in this please email me danny  and we can discuss more.

Law enforcement is hardly trying to track the individual users, if someone knew address a was linked to terrorist x then it would be quite easy to follow the chain back to the place bitcoin was origionally exchanged for fiat, these places are quite highly regulated, some exchanges dont even accept bank statements as proof of address because they are too easy to fake (other banks accept bank statements).
the thing is terrorists are not using black market sites, they take cash to their local arms dealer or receive them direct from the US and other NATO partners through proxy governments etc

I have never met a women yet whose eyes dont glaze over when I mention bitcoin. IT and finance is dominated by men in the 'real world' and this is no different.
Computers / email / the internet etc were originally male dominated but now its women who are glued to social media and online shopping. 
When bitcoin becomes useful on social media and shopping in general I predict women will get more involved
Men also spend more on large items whereas women buy more smaller items and bitcoin is perfect for micro payments.
Also its only a matter of time until attention-whores on facebook start collecting from changetip from all their selfies.
Women will start using bitcoin more when it is more relevant in the areas they frequently visit.

If drugs wern't monopolized in the US then competition would make them more economic for the consumer and save lives.

the Irony in this statement is incredible, its Bitcoin that powers the Blockchain! without it there is no incentive for anyone to mine.

the reality is that unless 100% of brokers commit to doing this (and they wont) you may aswell sell to them because someone else will anyway.

well Russian had to jack its interest rate upto 19% earlier in the year to stop it imploding (how else would they sell their bonds?) 
all these production based countries that are basically just feeding american consumerism peg their currencies to the $ to keep some consistency with export prices, but with this and many commodities (oil, gold etc) being prices in $ allows the USA to export allot of their inflation, infact the USA would have imploded already if all their $ was domestic only.
it is literally only central bank manipulation preventing a true global financial crisis. Most countries already have massive amounts of true inflation. Inflation really should relate to the expansion of the money supply but countries have their CPI figure (which doesnt even include housing, the single most expensive outgoing for almost everyone) which they rely on to justify low or even hilariously negative interest rates.
The federal reserve isnt raising interest rates because they are concerned the CPI (ie cost of living) isnt high enough. Tell that the millions who cant afford food and rely on food banks. 
global growth has slowed right down, all the people will collateral are already over leveraged upto their eyeballs, last time this happened they started lending to idiots (sub-prime mortgages) but now legislation prevents that to some extent. there is such a small amount of growth now central banks are devaluing their currencies boost exports and chase the dwindling growth thats left.

no they're not, they want to clamp down on bitcoin because its a massive threat to governments who cant defecit spend and print money to buy their own junk bonds. also they will try to ban cash on the same premise 
they just needed an excuse to start the clamp down on freedom of money / privacy. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 20:25:52
the price has to be high so the market cap is high enough to make double spending as irrelivant as it is today

The cost of counter fitting is the same as the cost of producing real coins so there is no incentive to make fake ones.

Lol ok, bitcoin is still an extremely speculative investment btw. Dont risk your entire families future on it.

Im a UK bitcoin broker and cant use it, no fraud protection as its too anonymous.

Probably worth mentioning that alot of these countries are known to harbour tax evaders on a very big scale. Most of the shell companies headquartered in Panama and Belize etc use banks in the Caribbean. 
They are high risk countries to operate in, good for bitcoin but bad for the residents.

Yes I do because the sender of fiat can call their bank any time and claim they got hacked and reverse the payment, then they have their money back and the bitcoins, the bitcoins dont get held in escrow forever, only until the payment clears. 
I have even asked this to Manfred (one of the Dev's) in person and he couldn't answer it.
I do trade P2P and broker larger deals if needed.
The bitcoin market will split in 2, the trades which people are happy to do KYC for and the rest will go underground and away from business like mine which pay taxes and into cash and burner sim cards.

Yes its incredibly easy to reverse, you have no idea what you are talking about I have been doing this almost every day for 2 years.
You have probably been smoking too much weed. Buying bitcoins with escrow == no risk of scam. Selling bitcoins without extensive KYC means you are going to get fraud very quickly, within days.

You are misinformed then, they are almost defiantly insolvent currently with ETC encase you haven't heard.
What criteria would have to be reached for you to stop using them?

Lets not kid ourselves, this is a for profit coin.
The dev's premined it (scam alert) and they are talking about proof of stake (scam alert)
Everything they have done it about pumping the price up, there is no reason that individual eth tokens should hold any value, there is almost no real demand for their intended use (smart contracts)
They are now talking about rolling back the chain to take coins from someone who exploited a vulnerability with something running at the application layer, not the core protocol. Ie bitcoin rolling back the Gox hack. 
So either they roll back the chain and save the price in the short term, or they let the hacker keep the coins and save the protocol, the whole point of a blockchain is its supposed to be immutable.

Having a US passport and falling under US regulation is a curse in the modern world, no wonder people are renouncing citizenship at ever increasing rates.
