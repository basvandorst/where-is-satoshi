I'm not sure I understand how this is a captcha. Can't a bot send bitcoins to an address as easily as, if not more easily than, a human?

So... 
Copyright law doesn't make it illegal to sell copies - it makes it illegal to *make* copies. If you burn a copy of a DVD and give it to a friend for nothing that's still a copyright law violation.
So the fact that you're getting bitcoins instead of dollars for your copies is totally irrelevant.
Also, the law isn't really that dogmatic about these things - as far as any judge is concerned trading something in exchange for another thing that has an ascertainable market value is the same as selling it for cash. There are plenty of bitcoin exchanges where you can trade bitcoins for cash, so that pretty much settles the issue.

At least within the US copyright law is consistent across all jurisdictions. Damages for making and giving away copies will be pretty much the same as damages for making and selling copies except insofar as you could also be required to disgorge any profits you made if you sell copies.
A court is also a little more likely to assess punitive damages if you're selling vs. giving away copies I guess, though whether punitive damages are even available in copyright cases is an open question.
What jurisdictions are you thinking of where copying is legal, but selling copies isn't? My understanding is that copyright in most European countries is in line with US law on this point, though I'm not an expert. Just as a practical matter, a legal system which allows making copies, and allows selling licensed copies, but doesn't allow selling unlicensed copies is going to be really hard to enforce.

So, a second question here. Won't it take substantial time for the captcha to validate since you'll need to wait for at least one block to confirm the transaction?
Without confirmation, my understanding is that it would still be pretty easy for a spammer to generate a bunch of invalid transactions (by double spending, say) and bypass the captcha. But most of the time people aren't willing to wait 10 minutes for a captcha to validate.

While I agree with you mostly, I would point out that blackjack actually has a positive expected return if you count cards, so there's at least one example of a table game that isn't -EV.
Of course if they figure out you're counting cards the casino will kick you out...

This is an interesting idea. 
So, first of all, it's worth noting that standard transaction fees are still less than $0.01 USD so bitcoins really are practical for very small donations, just not quite down to 1 cent.
In principle, as I understand it though, miners get to *choose* which transactions to include, and a lot of the power to decide which transactions are included belongs to the big mining pools. 
Someone should correct me if I'm wrong, but in principle they could decide to allow all transactions which go to a registered list of 'charitable addresses' if they wanted to. It might be possible for a charity to negotiate with the mining pools to suspend their fees for donations.
So that's an idea.

The world economy reflects the value of all human industry, and as we get more efficient at producing things we want/need the per-capita value of the economy goes up. Some resources are zero sum, but many of the important ones aren't. When someone discovers a new way to get greater yields from farms, for instance, this increases the net welfare, and that means that there's more total value to be shared by society. If we're talking game theory, this is basically the definition of a positive sum game. I get the sense that you don't really know what the economy is. Or maybe you don't know what a zero sum game is. It's hard to say.


And I have exactly zero respect for bullshitters with credentials.


Well, as long as we don't buy into our own bullshit, I'm ok with that. But I hope you realize that the reason it works that way because the elites like a system that keeps things ambiguous and allows them to advance their own interests even when they go against the greater good, and not because ideological approaches produce the best results.

I would suggest that dreams are not the best source of economic policy.
Actually, your suggestion has nothing to do with bitcoins at all, this is just the standard communist "lets redistribute the wealth and that will solve all our social problems" idea. 
While I'm the first to agree that in our current system the distribution of wealth leaves something to be desired, the fundamental purpose of currency is to facilitate efficient allocation of wealth and any attempt to reallocate all this wealth by fiat is going to cause a lot more problems than it solves.
Also, the world economy *isn't* zero sum, the economy is steadily growing making it a positive sum game. Where are you even getting this stuff? Are you just repeating phrases that sound cool?

Just some general investment advice: buying into *anything* when it has gone up in value by close to a factor of 5 in the prior 3 weeks is rarely a really good idea.

This is an incredibly trite and intellectually lazy attitude. Especially coming from someone with a masters in philosophy.

For what it's worth, I not only reported on the form, but sent coinbase.org an email also, so I'll let you know if that produces any results.

You know, I'm not normally not a big fan of advertising posts, but you're doing a good job of selling me on the site.
Do you guys have plans for linux support any time soon (I can play in windows on a VM, but native support is a pretty big plus for me)?

I'm also having some difficulties. I sent the payment, it shows up at the address on blockexplorer with 6 confirmations, but they're not confirming payment. I'm kind of wishing I'd just paid with paypal or something now...

As improv32 pointed out, the miner who mines the block decides what the fee threshold is for inclusion. As matters currently stand a large enough fraction of the miners out there are happy to accept zero fee transactions, so getting a transaction in a block is simply a matter of a little patience. It might take a few hours, or a couple days at the worst, but you can count on getting any transaction through eventually.
This state of affairs will eventually change - once the rewards go away transaction fees will be the only incentive to mine and probably few if any miners will accept zero fee transactions, but at least for now, if quick confirmation isn't important to you you can avoid fees.

Mine came through two after ~3 hours, so if anyone is having doubts they shouldn't worry too much!

I suspect that the main reason is that Mt. Gox hasn't been processing US cashouts for the last week.
