I held on tight. I'm not investing 'with' bitcoin, I'm investing in the future and 'in' bitcoin. I promised myself I wouldn't touch my savings of 10BTC for a year whatever happens. and I have a 2nd "current" account as well with a few more coins, but I held those too. And when I get paid on Monday I'm going to buy more, hopefully they go even lower, because I know that in a couple of months this little wobble will be over and they'll start to rise again.

Hey is it 5pm EST? 10pm here in Beriln :D
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:05:46
You didn't sell did you?
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:09:33
Depends how many you need.
If you're looking at just buying a few the best way is probably localbitcoins.com - it's pretty quick if you buy online. But you pay a few quid above market rate per coin.
If you want to buy more there is a method using transferwise and bitstamp.
Check out it's in the sidebar and its one of the posts.

Bitstamp is my Favorite.

fair enough, but is it not fair to say this is indicative of the general flow of the market?

These people were warned, "never invest more that you can afford to lose". I just lost thousands of dollars, but I don't care cos I'm easyyyy, easy like Sunday morning!!! By which time, coincidentally, the price will be back to normal.
**Edit** I might add; I only lost 1000s of dollars in value. I held, so I haven't really lost. You only loose when you sell out. but I'm a buy in kinda guy.

Can you just cash little bit at a time out? Is there some sort of yearly threshold?
@_date: 2013-03-27 22:10:44
I'm up for that. I'm a Film-Maker from London so it's cheap for me to fly over there. I was actually considering making a documentary about Bitcoins soon anyway. There are a ton of people we could try and interview. Max Kaiser lives in London I found out the other day.
@_date: 2013-03-27 11:09:14
Exactly. People are treating Bitcoin as if it is a mature stock, of which it is neither.

I love this graph, you can see the volume on the left side outweighs the right. Supply and demand in full effect.

Hey I would definitely be interested in hearing more. You can see some of my films here 
What sort of films are you looking to make?

Yeah, I've had this a few times with blockchain.info
When it works it's incredibly easy but it often has that message, which by the way, seems to reset at random and not at 5am. This is my observation anyhow.
Also: Can someone explain to me how blockchain acquires their bitcoins? Are they like a buffer of some kind?
@_date: 2013-04-02 02:27:21
How about googling from A to D then back to A and then to X!

WTF is happening! I'm scared.
@_date: 2013-03-24 20:50:48
I know a lot of people are saying it could go either way, but are there any conservative estimates or a sort of median outcome calculation. say if BTC stayed at ~$70 and difficulty increased my an estimated median amount if you see what I mean.

There are a few differences between Bitcoin regular Stocks/Shares etc.
Firstly a vast number of the people buying Bitcoin are not seasoned investors they will continue to hold even through downturns in value.
A lot of this has to do with the "idea" of Bitcoin. People believe in the concept of it. You're not just investing for profit you're investing in a new "idea" a new "way".
Bitcoin is not a company, they won't come out with a new product that no-one buys, there are no "Targets" or "Reports".
If apple makes a bad product their shares drop.
The Price of Bitcoin is determined by a few factors one of the main ones being the number of users. This number is only going to rise over the next year.
There is also still a very small market for exchanges. Once Mt.Gox gets bigger and/or other companies start to pop up making it easier and quicker to buy and sell Bitcoin we will see a huge rise in value I'm sure of it.

I agree. I never meant normal as in $266, but I meant back on the constant rise.

No one wants *your* currency.
@_date: 2013-04-01 01:05:58
Either that or use localbitcoins.com, it's really quick but it cost a bit more. But it's normally about 10-15% over market prive which isn't too bad if you're not buying loads, in which case I'd take the extra time to use the Bitstamp/Transferwise method.
@_date: 2013-03-27 22:26:12
I bough 8 BTC on 01/23 for about $130, played a little dice at fist, now I have 9 BTC worth almost $800.
Only wish I had bought more. When I get back from vacation I might buy 1 more just to make a nice round 10 BTC for me to sit on.

No, I doubt faith in the Euro is much better than it's been for the last week.

I wake up this morning and, like every other day, the first thing I do is check the price of BTC, and over night the prise has risen $25!!
I'm a bit nervous at the moment for a few reasons. I'm waiting for my deposit to come through on Bitstamp I just hope it comes through soon.
@_date: 2013-03-27 23:36:50
Yeah, but people on Facebook own businesses. We should add a bit saying if they own businesses how Bitcoin could benefit them.

Theoretically bitcoin could never exceed the global GDP / 21million. So around 3.3 million per coin is the limit.
@_date: 2013-03-28 12:35:46
I'm going to put half of my Bitcoins in one wallet which I will save for the next couple of years.
The other half I'm going to wait till this rocket boom stops, a time when the price stays roughly the same for a month or so then I'm going to use them.

Currency is defines as "A system of money in general use".
I know what you're getting at though, but a currency's value is based on demand if your wife and a couple of your friends and family are the only ones who accept your currency then it's gonna be worth next to nothing.
Just because anyone "can" do something doesn't mean shit. that like those people who say "I could have painted that "Warhol"/"Pollock"/"Rothko"". -"yeah well you didn't and they did"

I'm not asking people for money at this stage. I don't get it I proposed my idea in the aforementioned thread and it was really well received. Now I post I need some ideas and I get down voted?

Once the price kisses 100 it's smooth sailing from there on out!
@_date: 2013-03-27 10:55:31
No I agree and this post is just my opinion.
I also agee that people should only invest what they wouldn't mind losing.
I'm just saying that I think there are a lot of people waiting for the "perfect" time and you could end up wasting more money that way too.

Iv'e been setting up a project to do with this called BTC aware, I'd like to talk to you about it, at the moment we are thinking about targeting mainly London &amp; New York but I would love to expand.
It's still in development stage but I would love to hear from anyone who would like to contribute their time.
The rates you quoted seem a bit expensive, however the billboard is huge, I say it's better to go for the smaller ones and have lots of them instead. That way you reach a more varied audience. plus with a project like this you can get a new billboard every time you hit a certain amount.
Message me and we'll talk anyhow.

Here in England you have to be born upper class. It's not about how rich you are. So you'd be Middle Class if you came here.
