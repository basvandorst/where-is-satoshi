We went with Coinbase. We found their API and developer tools a breeze to use. 
The integration was pretty straight forward. Coinbase makes it super easy.
The most difficult task for me personally (as the developer doing the integration) would have been the testing. AFAIK there's no sandbox environment so all our testing was done using live payments. I had to move some funds between wallets and find the right testing price before things worked smoothly. I originally set our test titles to be about 5 cents but those transactions took forever. I ended up setting them to be a dollar each and they moved quicker.
We currently don't offer bitcoin payouts for the filmmakers. Once a filmmaker asks for it we'll definitely look into it.
Haha, yes our blog post does need a link to our site.

A number of us on the Reelhouse team have been big bitcoin fans for years now. It's been super exciting to work on this feature and we're really happy to see it live.
You'll find quite a few interesting independent titles on Reelhouse, along with a few Hollywood hits such as Gravity, Man of Steel, The Dark Knight trilogy and others.
If anyone has any questions about how we worked on this I'd be more than happy to answer them.

According to the Vogogo interac online page I get redirected to, this is only supported for BMO, RBC, Scotia, TD, Envision Financial credit union in BC, libro credit union and windsor family credit union in ontario.
I'm with Vancity in BC.
I'm assuming Coinbase is ironing out some kinks. Or am I vogogoing wrong?
With virtex I could just add the Vogogo details in my bill pay options.

I've gone ahead and set up EFT. FWIW I use Interac Online all the time and it lists hundreds of options (including all the credit unions for each province/territory). Not sure why your method only lists a few.

I've just double checked the options available. You support 4 major banks and 3 credit unions. I can assure you this is not "the full list of supported banks and credit unions"

I tried to check if the list is updated to include more than three Canadian credit unions but now the Interac deposit option is offline.
