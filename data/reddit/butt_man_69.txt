Alex Jones is this theatrical nut job who pretends to feel deeply about everything. He considers himself a libertarian. The guy in Chile I’m talking about was an American businessman who sold real estate to which he had no rights to libertarian apologists.

They tried that in Chile and got swindled by some Alex Jones type huckster.

I love that you can buy it with bitcoin which I'm not going to do, but still appropriate.

Bullshit. How the hell did it go up under Bush then more than with Obama? Just because they beat that over our head doesn't mean they don't LIE. These two insane ears are halfway privatized anyway so there's tons of corruption inherit in them financially.

No I'm not. Let me ask you this. What do you think would work better a universal healthcare system where the costs are spread out by a larger pool or no Medicare, cobra care, veterans assistance and privatized healthcare?

Well what the hell did we do before all this debt? The period between the late forties and mid seventies was the greatest economic expansion.
@_date: 2017-04-27 17:17:42
Eh those are good points. I will say though that Bush managed to get away right before the economy really started to tank. 
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:15:31
I did. It looks like Bush did slightly worse than Obama. We're in 20 trillion dollars of debt not because of "the stimulus package", but because wars aren't cheap. Don't forget Cheaney saying that "Reagan proved deficits don't matter."

Dude people get emotional about money. Have you ever met a Tea Partier? Also bringing up Rome and fear makes you sound like Reverend John Hagler preaching about revelations. How about we just believe in a common sense government like the rest of the developed world instead of a pre-modern era America that is only in theory.  Those things sound great, but they won't work nor last. I live in the South so I can tell you that the reason why we have a large federal government that intervenes is to prevent things like one group taking the rights of a minor group. Right. Is in places like Chechnya, Iraq or the Balkans things are a bit harder if you're living under a regime where certain institutions get to powerful for instance, the church, the police, an ethnic group, or even the government. All this talk about hating government here is followed up by how we need the military or police to have sci-if weapons to get the "bad guys."

I feel like someone should act like a kid in the nineties watching a dramatic movie. “YEAH! GET EM!”
