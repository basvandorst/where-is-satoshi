I thought I covered the truth machine comment well when saying "people use [full nodes] to validate Bitcoin transactions and blocks in a trustless manner. Full nodes communicate with each other by relaying block data in a peer-to-peer network forming an ongoing immutable chain based on proof-of-work"
As for the cost factor, I will have to do more research. I believe it is up to the node software website to be honest and upfront and list the pros and cons of their software. Therefore I directly link to their individual sites for more info. This way our site remains neutral and unbiased.

Just a design decision. Maybe we'll add an export tool to download the data! :)

You can easily convert the time to GMT if you wish. Also, nobody knows for sure if Satoshi is British.

I listed all the major Bitcoin clients that I'm aware of, if there are some missing please let me know. As for the client, if it forks to allow more data it doesn't mean that normal users won't be able to run the software. It may make it harder for some users, but storage these days is on the cheap side and I don't believe that would be an issue. With that said, it's not my choice, and as stated on the page I left the choice up to the users to make that decision.
