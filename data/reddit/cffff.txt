How'd you profit from the higher prices if you were buying back in what you spent??

since when do 'journalists' use memes..

enjoy it while you can. i baught some at 150 while they were on the rise in the end of March. they just went up and up and up!^then ^down ^and ^down ^and ^down

3-5% off isn't going to make me spend my coins when there's a chance they could be worth 10% more in 3 hours.

I'm guessing you meant to write "World Science" and 1945 is the class number? 
Your title is confusing, cool presentation though.

Haha nice, should have him hold a QR code though

I was wondering how this would work, as I know its not possible to change the icon of an app on the fly. For everyone wondering what he is doing is using push notifications to change the red 'new notification' bubble on the top right of the app to display value. Pretty clever, two thumbs up. 
ps. I need a weather app like this. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:51:41
i was just kidding lol. I've been in since $150/BTC and plan on holding
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:41:41
copy and past the whole code into a google spreadsheet. it should fetch a price when you press enter

Fantastic! This is just what I needed. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:20:40
I just got verified for instant. Is this different from what you're talking about? 
@_date: 2013-12-12 00:45:35
im using
and it dosent seem to be getting the right price. I'm trying to get it before the fees are calculated, so i can do my own calcs based on how much i want to buy. any ideas? 
edit: it seems like your original function returns the wrong number also, maybe its an issue with cache-ing? do you use it in googledocs?
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:00:43

Bitcoinwatch doesn't list coinbase problems, thats where im having problems
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:56:40
I guess you if you put it that way you could say any percentage drop is a tank. "Bitcoin tanks by 1%!!"
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:41:40
This is the way to go. Even in small amounts people will still be interested in claiming their new 'free money'. Just last weekend my girlfriend saw me checking the price of my BTC but quickly became disinterested once I started explaining. 
Sent her $0.25 USD today and she has been going nonstop research on it. Being a part of it, no matter how small, makes all the difference. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 22:17:26
since when does mint support coinbase?!?!?
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:38:49
found the thread! 
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:32:50
can you point me to more info about this money transmitter law? 
@_date: 2013-12-04 20:51:27
something might need to be tweaked. its showing everything at 0.00 mBTC for me. I'm pretty sure it would let me check out like this too but I don't wanna screw you over. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:58:00
As for in person I'd go with the same as my craigslist places:
* Public Place
* Bank
* Police Station
As always when dealing with large amounts of cash changing hands between strangers its always a good idea to:
* Bring a friend
* Never give more personal information than you need to
* Never meet at your home or theirs 
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:53:47
thats exactly what I'm doing. I get the price and then can multiply it by my holdings to display my profits on my desktop
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:23:08
this is what i needed to hear 
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:57:35
ohhhh i didnt know why it kept changing and didnt have the time to check into it
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:33:37
panic sell now

I've been looking for this website for ages. Thank you.
@_date: 2013-11-26 02:43:14
..and what is your passphrase?
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:58:31
can you send money back to coinbase just as easily? why do so many people complain about getting money out if you could just send bitcoin to another service, aka coinbase
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:49:54
nah, upward correction is the term you're looking for

Sounds like somebody just got some cheap bitcoins. ^so ^did ^I
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:28:56
depends on how you look at it. We've made 20% progress in the last week or two. 1k by christmas. 
^lol ^i ^wish
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:35:13
glad to hear it!
@_date: 2013-11-26 08:44:34
sounds like he wants to put something on display at his school to physically represent the coin to his classmates 
@_date: 2013-11-17 17:08:53
same over here.
note that this post was from 5 hours ago. I've seen other people saying they've had trouble connecting in between that time too. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:38:10
Exactly. That's how I think about gifts in general; something someone would love but never buy for them self. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:04:21
Don't. Try. To. Time. The. Market. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 11:51:57
Buy some bitcoin! Or any cryptocurancy. Once you're invested in it it's much more interesting to learn about. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:40:23
I don't think so.
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:43:26
What the fuck is a worldcoin? jeesus christ this is post is going to get downvoted to oblivion. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 00:50:50
seems like they only refresh the data once an hour. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:32:42
Without having to open the website? I think not. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:34:16
yeah but how do we *pronounce* them /s
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:49:09
They've gone down before people, with the same "Application Error". You're not gunna lose your coins, they're just bogged down with all the crazy trading today. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:14:19
I hate 'satoshi'. I don't know about anyone else but it sounds made-up and childish to me. I would have a hard time explaining bitcoin to a friend if I needed to use that word. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:57:31
shoulda done your research*
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:10:35
said in a thread earlier that he would be changing the default on bitcoinity to mBTC once we had an steady price over $1000. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:05:05
any questions from your bank? 
@_date: 2013-11-23 19:29:16
almost* look at the trees, something funky is going on.
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:55:21
it always seem like whenever I buy or sell it immediately moves in the other direction 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:05:29
naturally. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 03:51:34
might not have curl installed.. not really sure, i've only used it in Terminal on a mac. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:05:21
but they gave you the rate at which you clicked buy, right? 
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:27:54
how about where you're getting your current value from/ 
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:45:37
its been around 1k for a few weeks, its been around .3k for months. look at the big picture buddy. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:32:04
Take the 50mBTC you would give to the top two entries and use it to tip generously around reddit in non-bitcoin related subs.  
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:23:50
midnight tomorrow we're hitting $10,000. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:42:10
Give it time. If you look at the transaction notes it says when the expect to have it deposited in your account. It took them one day more than their original projection for my last deposit. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:09:13
do it. right now! 
but seriously, if the price goes up 50 bucks tonight you'll be kicking yourself in the morning 
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:49:31
That guy looks fucking miserable. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:59:24

@_date: 2013-11-19 02:49:20
anyone know if this is legit?
@_date: 2013-12-08 04:13:13
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:54:53




I might be misunderstanding it but it looks like it's saying that the $1000 limit does *not* apply to Bitcoin as it is a virtual currency. Correct me if I'm wrong. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:36:36


nor is gold, silver, or cash for that matter


Fun fact: you can't send vegetables over the internet. 
Had to stop watching at that point. 
also, what's a goot?

I was trying to figure out how to do this for a while but gave up. Couldnt figure out the sed command. Ended up being for the best though cause I was able to take the raw numbers and manipulate them to show current earnings/profits and whatnot.

Change the character in bold to the line where your favourite exchange is on bitcoinwatch (they change the order sometimes so check every now and then).
Does anyone know how to get the buy/sell prices from coinbase into a google doc? 
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:31:40
please don't beg for coins, no matter how subtly. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:38:17
yeah after looking at the altcoin charts it's clear that dogecoin is the only stable coin not tied to BTC. Such stability. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:54:27
bitcoin market is always open!
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:53:44
I was under the impression that gox would hold the fait in your account. You could then rebuy MORE BTC at a lower price later and move that out.
