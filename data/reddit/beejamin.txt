Bitcoin _is_ real money. It's just not accepted by as many merchants as the currency you normally use day-to-day (yet). Yes, you can exchange BTC for your currency of choice, but you can also retain your BTC and realise its 'profit' in the form of its increased purchasing power over time (if you're happy to assume it will increase over time).

Amazing car. Even more impressive given that you paid AUSTRALIA TAX on it.

Yep. Australia has a 'Luxury car tax' of 33% on vehicles worth more than ~AUD65K / USD48K , in addition to the cost of importing things to the arse end of the world.

Depending on where OP lives, there's no guarantee he had many multiple coins. There are plenty of places in the world where 2-3BTC will buy a more
than reasonable house.

That’s just saying “everyone else will do it, so I don’t have to”. There’d be no adoption if everyone has that attitude.

What are you trying to say with that response? Attitudes affect how people use any asset, and how they use it affects its adoption, stability and value.

Australia for now AFAIU - basically because btc is not recognised as a currency. It's legally pretty untested though - as purchases done this way scale up, a precedent will be set one way or another.

And then what? Cross back to your home country with a suitcase full of cash? Top plan, mate.

Ah, is that right? Not surprised. Thanks mate.
