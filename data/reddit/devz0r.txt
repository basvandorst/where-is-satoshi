I averaged every result on the [Mining Hardware Comparison]( I'm thinking of maybe separating the overclocked and the stock to address this issue.

Currently $90 with rebate, $5 shipping.

Thanks! It's appreciated. I hope to get one of those cards at the top myself. I currently have two from the bottom of the list :\\. Here's mine: 1FGwMXTaQHgzCwa3nJsWT9HrFXMWGWHXKq
Are you asking how much of a difference you'll make relative to the energy used in rig?

I took an average of all the Megahashes on the HW Comparison wiki for each card to give the most likely scenario.
I put the price of the cheapest available card with a preference to a higher rated card. If a 5 star rated card was within $15-20 of the cheapest card, I included that as I would assume it was what most people would purchase.

You are right. I could only find price ranges on Newegg for the 5970, but it seems that the lowest one was actually an Open box item. I can't seem to find this card anywhere, but I have seen some references to the price being around $500, so I will update that. Thanks!

I used Newegg and the [Mining Hardware comparison](  I couldn't find the prices on some of them.
*EDIT: I'm not entirely sure how to allow guests to sort columns in the spreadsheet, but if you click View -&gt; List, it will let you sort them in that view.

That was for prices that I was unable to find on Newegg. They either weren't in existence on the site or were currently not for sale.
*EDIT: Newegg included the ranges for some of them, but not the actual numeric price. I searched Google for sites selling those ones that fit within the range. Other than the 5970, the others (mostly lower 4000 series) don't seem like they are going to be going on sale again.
