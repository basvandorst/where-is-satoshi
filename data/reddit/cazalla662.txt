When Josh is arrested, convicted and imprisoned, just remember it was CoinDesk, CoinTelegraph and CryptoCoinsNews that promoted GAW to their readership via paid advertisements. Scams like GAW rely on such outlets to be successful. Those sites are complicit, they know it's fishy but take the money and look the other way thinking they can wash their hands of it simply because they are not directly responsibile.
They don't have their own pool because if they did, it would be easy to verify the blocks they have mined.

There are enough red flags when it comes to GAW Miners that it should give anyone pause about associating with them. Just because lots of other sites run scam ads doesn't mean it's right or that it's OK. A ponzi reveals itself once no longer sustainable, not before but there are clear indicators that an objective person would see if it wasn't for the fact it pays their bills as it is in your case.


Despite your attempts to make such behaviour acceptable, there is no misunderstanding.. selling ad space to scammers is not a business, it actually gets in the way of business because you push the price up for legitimate actors. Legitimate advertisers end up paying more because of all the scam money flowing in. Legitimate publishers find it more difficult to attract talent because dodgy outfits can afford to pay more and waste our time sorting through the bullshit.


Selling ad space to scammers is not an established or accepted practice. Companies such as Google have been fined for it. Lots of people might engage in it but that doesn't make it anymore acceptable.


Because you are corrupt and I want you to know that once this is all said and done, Bitcoin wins and the scammers go away, your acts will not be forgotten. Nor will the corrupt acts of others in this space.


In my experience,  is the most diverse group of people I've ever met and none of it was forced with leftist bullshit. So go ahead, label me a bigot but I guess it's easy to be optimistic when you line your pockets with victim's funds.
@_date: 2014-12-08 23:48:32

If you have enough bitcoin to warrant the use of something like this, there are better options. If you don't own a lot of bitcoin, there is no point spending a large sum of money on a trezor in proportion to your coins.
Can you check whether it has been fucked with prior to arriving in your letterbox? How do you know you can trust the people who make the Trezor not to send you a special edition that phones home first chance it gets. The bootloader code being available is no reason to trust the device simply because most people cannot read the code, so you have to rely on other people, but there are options available which only require you to rely on yourself.
Don't waste your money despite how many people recommend this device.

It's not different because the money GAW Miners pays to CoinDesk helps keep CoinDesk afloat, pay the bills, pay the staff, keep the lights on. How is that not support? How is that not an influence on what CoinDesk does? Sure, you could argue that it's subtle but it's there all the same.
The proof is in the mistakes, problems and management issues aka lies and deceit. You already know all this.. I get that you have bills to pay and you're not the boss man at CD, just don't act that there is no proof until the day GAW Miner's doors are kicked down by even bigger scammers.

Best approach, for me, is to keep 99% of coins in cold storage, never to be moved until day X. The other 1% can be used on desktop without a second thought, it gets stolen? Big whoop, more a heads up someone is scoping me... bring a fucking army, cunts.

@_date: 2014-12-21 21:15:14
No, Garza did not buy Qntra and has no influence over Qntra. Garza is a scammer, a liar and clearly, a sociopath. People who take his money and think it's OK because it's labelled "an advertisement" or "a sponsored story" are kidding themselves and are complicit in his scams.
You should also be calling out the mods who I suspect, but have no proof, of being paid off to enable sites like CryptoCoinsNews to continue posting their rubbish here. I think it was mid to late 2013 that CCN was called out here for just recycling content and feeding it back into the system. People like Caleb Chen aka [bitbybitbybitcoin]( are actually shadowbanned but continue to post comments/links.
Qntra is listed on [MPEx - same place Satoshi Dice was listed)]( barely any shares have changed hands and we're yet to produce revenue or a profit. I'm not anti-advertisement but I am against advertising obvious scams and dubious products from people who cannot be verified to be honest or to have an honest product or are simply pumping some fucking altcoin/token in an attempt to claim seigniorage because they feel they missed out on Bitcoin. We currently have no advertisements and part of that reasoning is the fact there are so many fucking scammers in this space. Scammers like Garza actually get in the way of doing real business and are an overall net loss as CCN will eventually find out.
Despite being pro Bitcoin, I do not invest much time or effort here at and I wouldn't advise others to do so either as the comments will give you a warped view of who and what the Bitcoin community consists of. It truly is the peanut gallery.

It's a nice thought but you're better sticking to baby wipes and nappies.. you know, something they can use immediately. If you give them a paper wallet, it's going to be overlooked in favour of more practical gifts and likely forgotten about.

I can't read anything more than HTML, some CSS, basic python so if I use a Trezor, I have to trust that someone else will review the code and continue to do so because the fucking thing can be updated and I have to trust that they aren't lying to me and no matter how hard I try, I can't guarantee some idiot won't inadvertingly plug the trezor in to an internet connected machine. Perhaps I'm taking a shit and the kid, rummaging through whatever, thinks it's a gameboy and plugs it in, who fucking knows? There are a million ways in which it might happen.
If I use a Trezor, I have to trust that no-one at the hardware manufacturer fucked with it, I have to trust that no-one is leaning on the Trezor team and forcing them to keep quiet as to force them to ship a product which can be exploited broadly or specific to me. God knows just how long the chain of people the device has passed through the hands of before it arrives in the letter gox. Even if you trust satoshi labs 100%, that's not a good enough reason.
For years people such as Andreas have recommended people use blockchain.info under the guise that it allows you to control your own private keys. That has been shown to be a total load of bullshit time and time again, now he recommends Trezor, well fuck that too!
Every second company in Bitcoin is producing either some type of wallet whether it be a web one or hardware device. I don't trust anyone that acts super concerned about my money let alone bitcoin.
None of this might seem plausible or likely when the price of bitcoin is $350. You are likely to find that the people you entrust at this price might go rogue when the stakes are much, much higher.
The better option can be read here -  - you don't need to adopt every recommendation, just enough of them so that the only real threat is a physical one which is arguably easier to guard against.. Sure, this advice flys in the face of all the bitcoin has to be easy to use so it's adopted bullshit you will read here but you want to avoid such idiocy.

You're either complicit in the scam, in which case you cannot be trusted or incapable of being objective and doing a background check on the advertister, which again means you cannot be trusted. So, which is it? You first said Garza does not sponsor CoinDesk but what the fuck do you think his advertisements are?
The funny thing is, when we spoke a few months back on IRC, you claimed there were no GAW Miners advertisements on CoinDesk and you expressed your disappointment when I showed you otherwise. I wonder why that would be, eh?

Fucking countless others are running or have run them over the past year and it's not just websites either, you've got the likes of [Steve Beauregard]( of GoCoin doing deals with Garza and calling people haters if you call it out. Who's a big investor in GoCoin BTW?
Honestly, when the SNI say [everyone is a scammer]( and to act as such, they are not fucking kidding. People have no idea just how much money is being made from scamming and not legitimate Bitcoin business itself.
They've also sponsored conferences such as
* Hasher's United 
* Inside Bitcoins conferences - 
* North American Bitcoin Con-ference - 
These events cannot run without sponsors, who are often scammers using scammed funds and the conference brand and its speakers to leverage their scam as to scam even more money. Half these fucking things wouldn't even run or could be done a lot cheaper if they actually scrutinised their speakers, sponsors and exhibitors.
Probably others.. point is, the scamming is so fucking pervasive, there is no shortage of people lining up to take his money. People who lost money in this, you best look to the people that runs these websites, these conferences and their speakers because that is where some of the money ends up.

Trezor because its bootloader is not (or at least, was not) open source, not to mention the fact that it passes through the hands of an unknown amount of people before arriving in your letterbox. How would you know if it had been fucked with or not? I wouldn't store bitcoin on something which can be updated and connected to the internet either. If it's useless for storing large amounts of bitcoin, what use does it have in storing a small amount too? I can use a mobile wallet for small amounts, don't need a trezor.
Shapiro wallet because this idea of women in tech thing is utter bullshit and leads to mediocre products paraded around simply because a woman is involved because.. you know.. equality, because SJW type bullshit. I wouldn't use anything bitcoin related if it was made by a woman because the majority of women (not all) in bitcoin are there simply because of the leftist faggots who go to every conference and claim we need more women, more minorities in Bitcoin.
FWIW, I can think of like.. 3 women (hanbot aka MPOE-PR,  and  in Bitcoin who I respect, not because they happen to be women but because they are intelligent and have intelligent things to say. The fact they are women has nothing to do with it, which is as it should be.

The audience will ask him about this $20 Paycoin floor, something which they've heard about online but not seen the actual quotes. Garza will respond that he never said that, people will shrug their shoulders and say oh well because everyone in the room can't fact check what he says at that very moment in person when all his scamming shit is done online.

Pretty much.
Look at it this way, if the only downside you faced when placing a bet on a wager which has a known outcome and is closed was that your coins were returned in full, why would you not do it for every single bet?

Let's use a sports match as an example. 
Bettors place their wagers pre and mid game but the angle shooter comes in places his bet post game, after the outcome of the wager is already known. Some people think they can outsmart the system and peel off a little bit of profit in the process without risk.
Warning people that attempt to engage in this practice that they risk forfeiting their bitcoin is the deterrent, but a few idiots ignore that warning, thinking it's a bluff. Without such a deterrent, you basically create a risk free opportunity for these people to skim off the top and have them waste your time issuing refunds. Bitbet.us, just like any other site, cannot stop people from sending bitcoin to an address, but why should they work for free and waste time issuing refunds to these idiots? It would be an endless amount of work if there was no risk to the angle shooter, you'd end up with more of them.
It's not some big bad bitbet.us conspiracy, other sites, such as [newsandscore]( give angle shooters the same warnings:

Relative to bitcoin, it's almost back to what it was when litecoin was 5c or something like 0.003 btc. Expect to see it unwind even faster as more and more people from 2012 to early January 2013 realise they're getting close to the same price they bought litecoin at with their bitcoins and their long term hold has resulted in less bitcoin even if litecoin is still in the 50c range.

This change is beyond fucking stupid. If disk space and bandwidth were always increasing at such a pace faster than the blockchain, surely we would be seeing an increase in the amount of nodes and not the on-going reduction year after year. Despite more and more bitcoiners, there are less and less nodes.
There are 136 people currently running a node from within Australia. I would wager that within 3-5 years after such an increase in the blocksize limit, there won't be any. It already chews so much of my fucking bandwidth and this scheme of USGavin's is going to force people to shut down their node.

NewsBTC was one of the best news sites around. The former owner had planned to shut the site down around October/November of last year because he couldn't keep up with the likes of CCN (who are able pay for so much content by advertising every scam going around), but it was purchased from him by an unknown individual or group.
Given NewsBTC has run the same advertisements as CCN and that Caleb Chan moved from editor of CCN to editor of NewsBTC (for a short time), I speculate it's actually now owned by Jonas Borchgrevink. I have no proof or any evidence for such a claim though.
As someone involved in the Bitcoin news space, I can tell you it is fucking depressing to see the amount of fraud, payola, bullshit that goes on.

[BTCjam is a scam](  You basically threw away 1 BTC, the reason that that's all you have to throw away is because people who own more are not typically as stupid to lend bitcoins to scammers and the ones that are had their coins jacked in years gone by. 2012 might've seen people willing to lend 1000 coins, 2013 100, 2014 10 and 2015 1.

If you keep reinvesting then yes, you will have thrown the 1 BTC away little by little.


If these investments were such a good offer, surely BTCJam would be investing themselves instead of skimming off the top of each investment.


90 days isn't ideal because many people on there borrow for the sake of building trust. Sure, they might pay back during the first 90, 180 days until they can lend enough to make that investment of their time pay off by borrowing/stealing a larger amount and returning on a new account to rinse/repeat.
As for irons in the fire, that's what bitcoin itself is. Buying and sticking it under the matress is hands down the best investment.

I attempted to engage Gavin with an anecdote of running a node in Australia and how the sorry state of Internet access here and an increase in the blocksize limit would likely spell the end of Australian nodes (This won't happen, but not because Gavin's plan is harmless but because we have an alternative client so as to continue to keep the network running.)
If the numbers bitnodes provides are to be believed, Australia floats between 100-150 nodes a day. One might argue that the NBN that the Australian government is building/destroying would lead to an increase but it's unlikely to be the case. As an example, look at the countries known to be broadband meccas and you will find dismal numbers. South Korea, with under 30 nodes, is the perfect example. I'm one of the few Australian's who run a node, paying for it out of my own pocket. We're supposedly a first world country and yet we're struggling to increase the number of nodes.
So, I shared some screenshots with Gavin via twitter to give him an idea of what happens to someone's home internet connection - quota of 250Gb exhausted before month ends, capped internet is the result keep in mind, I've upgrade twice so as to specifically continue running my node.
Do you know what Gavin's response was? [To block and ignore me]( He clearly read what I had to say given such a reaction. This is a good example of how Gavin is able to go around claiming consensus, he simply ignores anyone he believes to be a dissenter.
Unfortunately for Gavin, but fortunately for us, a real [Bitcoin foundation]( is developing a real client, one that will see us through the disaster that Gavin is all too willing to unleash upon the world for his friends at the CIA.

No, not flukes or random transactions. We can see a transaction on the blockchain but that doesn't mean anything as for all we know, the coins are being passed around by the same person. Look, the real point here is that the USG lies, even when it tells the truth, it's usually to benefit another lie that they've told. The USG also uses stool pigeons and has long ties to the mainstream media.
If you believe Bitcoin has the potential to topple governments, it only makes sense to believe welfare programs such as the USG are also aware of this and will stop at nothing to keep their grip on power just a little longer.

It's not surprising, for if you look at who writes for CoinDesk, you will find many of them identify with lefties, feminists and similar ideologies associated with the mentally ill, SJW and white knights found enmasse here at Reddit. For example, Tom Sharkey is just one of a few beta limp wristed white boys who prattle on about about equality, poor black people and so on when not writing for CoinDesk.
The good thing is, people like Tom Sharkey and Andreas Antonopoulos don't actually hold any considerable amounts of bitcoin, therefore their opinion is worthless. Even better, Bitcoin does away with socialism and that political ideology and its followers will die because there won't be any fiat to fund the communist professors that taught this shit to people such as the above named.
These types of people are going to grow more vocal over the coming years, but sit back, laugh and enjoy yourself because Bitcoin is going to teach them a very harsh lesson. They will die begging on the streets and deserve nothing less. These people cannot subvert Bitcoin, but Bitcoin is subverting them, they just won't know it until it's too late.

This line of thinking only works if one believes that everything the government says is true and is therefore an indisputable fact. For people that doubt every word the government says, ever said and will say, anything and everything they claim remains in dispute until such time it can be verified.
A couple of transactions on the blockchain and some flunkies who quote the USMS PR rep is not sufficient evidence that the USMS held Bitcoin auctions or that if they did, that any bidders were actually successful in purchasing coins from their beloved government.

The increase will make Bitcoin inaccessible to normal people because if you don't run a node, you are not a part of Bitcoin.
A pruned node is not a full node and it's full blown brain damage to think otherwise.

How is it a big deal when I can pull out my credit card and make a deposit right now? A big deal would be pokerstars actually doing some market research and acknowledging that people, such as myself, want to play for bitcoins, not cash. Let them collect the bitcoin rake and sell that for cash if that is what they want.
With bitcoin to fiat and back again, you might actually come out a loser despite winning at the tables if the bitcoin price moves during play. In that case, the +EV move is not to play at all, defeating adding bitcoin as a deposit option in the first place.

I'd have avoided anything to do with shady characters on a personal and business level. Sure, that might mean you're no longer welcome amongst the perceived big boys club but that's a decision only you can make.
If you're happy with your decisions and don't believe anyone that attended or that you associate with is anything but an upstanding honest person, then I wouldn't give it another thought to what other people think. Lots of people here at make the same claims about some of the people I look up to (such as Mircea Popescu) but I don't let it worry me.

LOL c'mon now brucey bruce. You were [pumping it on reddit]( and [twitter just a few weeks back]( but because you didn't get the validation you were seeking (0 comments), you're back at it with CoinDesk for another attempt.
This list of "elite" are bunch of shady fucks. A good example is right at the top of your list.. Steve "[haters are only motivators]( Beauregard. That guy runs a bucket shop and even teamed up with Garza's Paycoin until VC's told him to pull his fucking head in.

@_date: 2015-02-19 21:11:31
I don't know that it is, but I work on the assumption that a password manager on an internet connection machine spells trouble. GPG encrypt your private key from an offline machine and keep it safe that way instead.

It's not about the tweet, it's about him either being a) too stupid to know better or b) saw an opportunity to fuck people, either way, he can't be trusted. Clearly investors had enough concerns about his getting into bed with Garza that he was told to get back out or there would be no more rounds to keep his shit afloat.
If you're going to associate with such people, don't act surprised when people associated with them begin to use your name to further their own scams.

Oh, so that violence doesn't count? Half these fucking hippies who use SR won't even buy a coffee if it isn't fair trade yet dealer to dealer violence is "part of the game" heh OK. None of this should exist, but it does and SR isn't the solution to these problems.


I never said SR users, I said people have been kidnapped and that the people doing that sort of thing might be inclined to look for softer targets known to have bitcoin aka SR users.

Clearly none of you run a node, for if you did, you would not be so trigger happy to raise the blocksize.
There's is what.. 132 Australian nodes right at this very moment. I already began coughing up an extra $20 to keep running my node, how exactly are people in less fortunate countries going to participate in the network or do you just expect rich people to maintain the network for them?

Sounds like more reason to use bitcoin as the unit of account, not dollars.

It's not really a metric of any value as the wallets can be created at whim by either them or another party to inflate the numbers. On the other hand, one might be inclined to believe the number should be higher than claimed as only idiots use web wallets and there is no shortage of them.
