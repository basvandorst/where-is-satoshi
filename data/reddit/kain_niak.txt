What they mean by blockchain is a database in the cloud, while Satoshi offered the first practical solution for people to have their computers work together without having to trust the other people but without people being able to cheat. So if you deploy a blockchain within a organization that is not trust less then you have not used blockchain technology at all, you have just used a database that's maintained by different computers, but if you own all those computers it's not decentralized the same way as Bitcoin.

But Lightning is not here yet and in the mean time Bitcoin Core is slow and expensive compared to other crypto currency, so why would people choose a payment system that does not exist yet over one that already exist? Like I said, the debate is not about offchain transactions. The debate is about what the first stable layer looks like before you start building on top of it. Right now that base layer is already pushing people away because of long confirmation times and high fees. 
This will lead to an ecosystem where directly building on top of the base layer is not for everybody, only the bitcoin rich. Then if new comers want to build a business on top of Bitcoin they are forced to go through a offchain solution because otherwise it would be to expensive for them. While if you keep that base layer open for everybody in the beginning, when use adoption is still low, you get the opportunity for many many different systems to be build on top of Bitcoin. That will keep offchain system decentralized so nobody can get a monopoly on a offchain system. 
As long as there is not the Bitcoin usage that NEEDS scaling, offchain is a pipe-dream and a blocksize increase as simple as changing some code and finding the consensus for it.  And by the time Lighting is there, Bitcoin will have pushed people that want a payment system to other crypto and then Bitcoin will be a settlement system and a store of value ..if it can retain that value which is going to be hard without the use for it (it's not a soft shinny metal that does not rust) .  But maybe when all the banks and governments see it's pointless to fight crypto they will embrace it and make Bitcoin core at the center of that. Then Bitcoin will again be something for the elite. 
Technically for everybody but realistically only for those that can afford it.  But by that time the people will use a crypto that does for them what they want. For example: I like to be able to directly pay online and tip people on social media. And send funds to my family directly,, that they can use to buy stuff with. Bitcoin core is no longer on it's way to become this tool I am looking for. But that's okay, there are alternative. Right now I even prefer Ethereum over Bitcoin Cash bcause confirmations are faster. As for it being centralized, that's only a problem when it will actually be attacked. And right now crypto is still way to small to pose a significant threat to any government or bank. And Ethereum is still decentralized enough, before it becomes a threat it needs to grow and when it grows it will become more decentralized just like with Bitcoin. So that's a problem that fixes itself. Something decentralized in software and something decentralized in human beings is completely different.  
There can be 5 million Bitcoin nodes online but if 4 million of those are operated by a group that listens to a single guy then it's decentralized on a technical level but not on a political level. Anyway, crypto is survival of the fittest so time will tell what the right way of going forward was. It's all unexplored territory so nobody has a goddamn clue, we have not been here before.

This is not true, all we wanted was a temporarily relief so Bitcoin stays a payment system that is usable and  remains to have benefits over other payment systems (or you might as well keep using paypall). The very nature of the system where everybody always needs to see everything will always create a giant amount of overhead. If Bitcoin ever needs to scale up off chain systems are unavoidable. However if the blocksize limit was just increased even to 2 MB like 4 years ago everybody could have worked together towards offchain systems.  The reality is that right now offchain systems are not needed, they might be in the future if user adoption grows exponentially but not now. The only thing that was needed was an increase in the blocksize, any increase for that matter. With Bitcoin Cash bitcoin now has that and we will see what was the right choice, the market and the users will decide. Anyway Bitcoin Core is now going to become a settlement system and more a store of value (that you can still use for payment) and Bitcoin Cash more a payment system (that you can still use as a store of value)  And only time will tell what happens next.  If the developers had been a little more reliable around 2013 then Ethereum would have been build on top of Bitcoin and we would already have had a good offchain system. Luckily Butterin saw the danger and did the right thing.  If Bitcoin is becoming an ideology it's because of no even beyond that; it's becoming a cult. A cult where there is no room for thoughts or ideas that go against the cult leaders.

Today the volume was 
3787 million Tether
424 million USD
335 million other fiat currencies. 
Source: 
This is the traded volume of cryptocurrency today. Tether is a coin that belongs to one of the biggest crypto currency exchanges, Bitfinex. It is a token that  runs on top of Bitcoin. Bitfinex is the issuer of that token. They can create or destroy as many tokens as they want. The token system is just a database where the data is stored as a special field for data in a Bitcoin transaction. They are using the blockchain as their database file. 
80% of the current market is trade between this self made token and crypto and not trade between fiat currencies and crypto. 
Imagine going to a [big auction]( for flowers. There are two lines. In one line traders buy and sell their flowers and pay and receive euros for them.  In the other row traders buy and sell their flowers with tokens that belong to Royal Flora Holland. 
80% of the traders are in the token row, 20% in the euro row. 
You want to sell one of your flowers. The traders in the euro row want to give you 1 euro for your flower. 
But the traders in the token row want to give you 10 tokens for your flower! 
In what row will you sell your flower? Royal Flora Holland promises that when you are done trading and you are leaving their market place they will give you one euro for each of their tokens. 
But unknown to you,  Royal Flora Holland is using their own tokens to buy their own flowers to increase the price of their flowers. There are always traders on the floor willing to trade tokens and euros with each other for a 1 on 1 price. Everybody knows that since Royal Flora Holland will always give you 1 euro for 1 token, that's the price! There is no point in selling 1 euro for 2 tokens or 2 euros for 1 tokens because Royal Flora Holland their promise can be trusted (so far). 
The price per flower in both rows is now 5 tokens/euro per flower. Without the token row the price would be 1 euro per flower and without the euro row the price would be 10 tokens per flower.

What happened you say? yesterday the price was 5 and today it's 1! 
"Have you not heard the news", a trader says. "The CEO of  Royal Flora Holland  has been arrested for artificially driving up prices on his own auction, which is illegal."
But this is a different auction, we are at Kraken Flora! 
"Yeah but you can't make a profit anymore buying flowers for 4 euro's here at Kraken Flora and selling them for 5 euros at Royal Flora Holland so the new price is now 1 euro, just like it was before Royal Flora their tokens. "

Stuxnet was able to jump the air gaps between Iranian computers used in their laboratories and the computer of the engineers are home over thumb drives. Not an easy thing to pull of cause you got to write a virus that can flash the firmware of a thumb drive from a computer, and of course you have no idea what type of controller that drive is going to be. 
A bitcoin virus that works that way needs to be even more advanced cause data needs to also jump back in the other direction. Stuxnet was a 20 million dollar virus ....

This is not true. There is some use, maybe not that much. But it will only grow. 
I could link you hundreds and hundreds of videos of people using Bitcoin and other crypto in Venezuela to buy stuff with. Some of which I am partially responsible for with my own projects to stimulate and promote adoption. I outsource internet based work and I have lots of people from Venezuela that do small jobs for me here and  there. At least 25% of them have local places to spend their Bitcoin and/or other crypto directly. 
in fact I can honestly say there is way more crypto adoption in Venezuela then there is here in Canada. And why would't there be? In Canada the current banking and money system works just fine for 99,9% of society. In countries like Venezuela they don't. So Bitcoin is a good alternative and usage in Venezuela will only grow.

the fact that it's not grandma friendly. that your funds gets locked up. large transactions have problems sending. That it's a hassle to have to maintain an open channel with every vendor you transact with restricting your freedom to eat/shop at new places. That you don't really own your money with a custodial wallet. It's a hassle to have to pay exchange fees to convert your LN coins to Bitcoins especially if there is a minimum and/or maximum amount. That there's no clear roadmap or time frame for any company that's working on the LN, I really wanna know what's next to look forward too.

- old computer that can go online (or new, but old is cheaper)
- take a popular and trusted distro of linux
- Download and check hashes
- Install Linux
- Install Electrum. 
- Remove the network card or do whatever it takes so this machine can NEVER EVER GO ONLINE.
- Generate priv keys on this machine and write down the backup seed phrase on a piece of paper.
- Export the watch key to your online computer using a thumb drive.
- import watch key in to your Electrum on your online computer. 
- make transactsion in your Electrum online computer from your watch wallet. But they are unsigned. Save them on to a thumb drive. Open them on offline computer, sign and put signed tx on thumb drive.
- Check tx before broadcasting from only computer.
Quite a fail proof method, but less convenient than a hardware wallet. However it can be cheaper when you use a  computer that is old enough to be free. 
It can only be hacked by a virus so sophisticated it can jump the airgap on a thumbdrive, extract the priv keys and smuggle them back to your online computer. Creating a un targeted virus like that is almost impossible, creating a targeted virus is to expensive. 
If you ever go online with this machine, consider it compromised the moment it goes online. 
If you can't take the network card out. Disable the onboard in the bios and put tape on the port so you never plug it it.

Why would banking blockchains come online? Banks are only interested in replacing current communication systems with better ones that are cheaper and more secure. Big parts of banking networks run on their own little internet and are hard to connect to from the internet. And even if a hacker would exploit something the bank dudes would come together and issue a roll back. The banking system is based on trusting each other and not giving acces to players that are not trusted. So what can zero trust technology do for banks anyway?

You can also memorize a private key or come up with a unique enough passprhase (like 12 random words) and use that to generate the private key.

- Go to an online system and transfer funds to the adress you created on an offline system
- Put the piece of paper and usb thumb drive and external hard drive in a safe. 
- shutdown the computer you generated the address on. 
Your coins should be as safe as they possibly can be.

All you need it an old computer and a thumb drive. With Electrum or Electron Cash setting up a hot wallet/cold wallet system is a piece of cake. And moving a thumb drive between a computer that can not go on the internet and one that does is not even that much work.
Yeah hardware wallets are more convenient but I'd say if you use a 10 year old computer as your cold wallet, it's even safer than a hardware wallets. Hardware wallets are targets, it's very unlikely that a 10 year old computer would already contain malware to steal your Bitcoins ....  
All you got to do with such old computer is take the network card out, or disable the onboard in the bios, or put a piece of tape on the network port. Than install linux from a thumb drive that also contains an installer for Electrum.
With all of that being said, hardware wallets are expensive. 10 year old computers are not.

No not the wallet itself, that only had code to take a 0.5% transaction fee on every transaction and forward that to the wallet of one of the developers. 
The scam that really got some users good was websites that would help you claim your bitcoin gold, all they needed where your wallets seeds. That scam made a million dollars in just 3 or 4 days as people basically did the same as putting their bank-locker account information and keys in a envelope and mail it to a random stranger.

Still better then giving a way 11 bitcoins to a random stranger on the Internet cause you got a mental illness and became a retard for a couple of month. (this was at the end of 2011, they where worth about 70 euro when I gave them away) 
To be fair I would have probably sold a percentage of them when the price hit 200 if I had still had them. But I am still sour about the whole thing. From all the 20 bitcoin I had, I gave 11 away. I lost 4 on bitfinex when I gambled and lost and I still have the others on a RAID 5 config that needs a LGA 1336 motherboard an areca card. And then I need to figure out the windows password (because of windows encryption) and then the wallet password. This sytem was working till 2013 when I shipped it to another country and the airport people trew it around so hard the weight of the heat-sink broke the motherboard. I have not had enough money since to put the system back together, which might turn out to be a good thing since it forced me to hodl.

DHT mainline bittorent, the distributed hash table network that makes bittorrent more decentralised has between 15 and 30 millions nodes online every day. The data that goes over bittorrent and bittorrent like protocols accounts for more then 10% of all data. The majority of that data transfer is produced by people like you and me. If people go out and buy a 8 TB hard drive just to store porn they download for free I don't really see the problem with bitcoin scaling. Now I am not saying bitcoin scaling to 200 000 transactions per second. But there is very large gap between 10 tx per second and 200 000 per second. If bitcoin wants to see more user adaption it will need to offer a better service then alternative.

Just wait until another bitcoin fork becomes popular and somebody writes software for it with the explicit intent of leaking your private keys to the network when you make a transaction in the hope there are bitcoins connected to that private key. That's why before trying to sell forked coins you should send the original coins to a newly generated address. But even then, running any unknown software on a system that has any private keys stored is a huge risk. And a smartly written bitcoin stealing virus might just sit there and watch for a long time before it does anything, and then steal from hundreds of users at the same time.

TLDR; Nobody knows the future price of Bitcoin unless you have to power to influence the entire market (like some people from China apparently have, also since like between 50 - 70% of the bitcoin mining is done in China.)

Be careful, be patient, try to only take small risks, and only play with funds you can afford to loose.

I still have a number of hard drives and broken computer configurations with a little bitcoin here and there. Don't know how much and I am glad all the  configs are not working and have not been working the last 5 years or I would have probably have already spend it. I am talking about RAID 5 configs with like a broken areca controller. To access my funds (and again just little scrabs here and there) I need to invest to replace some hardware so I can get all my old computer stuff out of storage and rebuild. Most of them have windows encryption on and I am not even sure if I will be able to remember all the paraphrases needed to unlock the wallets but if bitcoin keeps going up in value one day there might be enough payoff to go through all my old hardware and see what can be done. That's why I have not sold or gotten rid of any of my old hardware since about 2012 when I immigrated to Canada. On a similar note I had 11 BTC that I gave away during a mental illness break down. And I still monitor my addresses and on some people have send funds. (I make a lot of free music that's spread around the internet that sometimes has one of my BTC addresses attached to it). So yeah not having straight forward access to my own privatekeys might be a good thing in the long run for me. Even if it's half a  bitcoin on that address and 0,01 on that address.  In 2011 half a bitcoin was not much.

Not in the beginning or In the beginning the community was awesome and it was very excited to be part of something like this. Then people started making big profits and became a tool in safe guarding those.

TLDR; What goes down might go up, what goes up (too much to fast) probably will come down. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:26:19


No because of the hack and because banks are trying to make it hard on them.

If only there was another place on reddit where we could take about bitcoin.

NEVER SELL BITCOIN! EVER!

What if the price suddenly is 3 times as high or 4 times as low. You would scare the shit out of you and drop your phone in it. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 15:10:26
I usually take a shit first, then I come here and see if I can find more shit in my toilet or here.

Yeah well on of the cliches about the bitcoin community is that everything is always good news for bitcon. But when is something good for an entire community, many people are in it for many different reasons. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:46:33


I too dumped bitcoin, although I never thought it was dumb.  
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:44:35
20% gain in 24h is pretty insane. Question is when will the drop come? 
@_date: 2017-10-05 12:57:30
You can always join us at We are a shit sub too, just marginally better then this one. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:31:28
So far after every all time high there has come a point where there was another all time high  but logic demands there will at one point in the future be a all time high that will never be broken, the trick is to sell before that. Good luck! 
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:54:47
What about bitcoin cash? 
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:28:55
In the current fork race would you like to see Bitcoin Cash, SegWitX2 or the current Core version of Bitcoin become the dominant chain? 
@_date: 2017-10-08 14:08:57
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:15:33
Then why are you checking the price like rabbits in spring season? Forget about bitcoin for 20 years and  then have your retirement. What is more likely to happen is that the price will go really high one day and you will sell.

You know how he got his first seeders? Take a guess. Mainline DHT has between [15 and 30 million nodes EVERY DAY]( The traffic and storage involved in [what-the-internet-is-for]( in comparison with the current bitcoin network is like giving a blue whale some food and being like: did you like that, that's a tictac! 
I wonder why nobody is building a killer app that gives the user some other benefits that can be completely separate from bitcoin but have the user pay for it by doing something to benefit the network. Like a netflix for [what-the-internet-is-for](  The network effect of that could be HUGE. Bitcoin alone just does not cut it if we want a grow rate like successful internet applications and mainstream adaptation. (like facebook or reddit)  how-money-works-behind-the-screen is boring for the average person. 
Bitcoin can use another kick to the starter (no not that website).
Would be nice to have a summit of world leaders (send by bankers) somewhere in the next 10 years about this new global threat of crypto.

In other words the banks are annoyed that we still use coins and paper money. They would like to know it when you buy a pop from a vending machine, you know ... for protection!  Basically they want to be the gate keepers, cause that's a fun job that comes with riches and power. But we protect you! We PROTECT YOU!!!!! COME BACK TO OUR PRISON IT IS SOOOO VERY SAFE HERE.

I lost 4000 dollars on bitfinex years ago when I had a short position around 70 and it rose to much and I got liquidated. But the 4000 dollars came from 400 dollars I turned in to 4000 dollars. And that 400 came from selling crypto. So I lost my profit! Still sour about that one. Also gave 11 bitcoins away when I went crazy and had a mental breakdown. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:30:36
Yes, we will break 6K soon and then 7K probably monday. And then after the fork there is no reason for bitcoin not to break 10K.

I once said the same thing when I bought at 72.

349 240 482 CAD per bitcoin.
That's my absolute MAX. When that happens I will all my 0.00000003 BTC  for 10 CAD and live the retired live.  
@_date: 2017-10-05 14:38:43
Yeah but you missed their value in bitcoin, so this is incomplete.
@_date: 2017-07-31 05:49:03
What do you expect? It's something purely digital that has value and can be stolen with greater anonymity then anything else if done right. A world running on bitcoins is the dream of every black hat hacker.

Just because it has never crashed way under the previous low of the previous bubble does not mean that will never happen. Things that happened in the past are no guarantee for things in the future.

When I generated one of my vanity addresses I got part of my belgian last name in the end of the address! Totaly a freak of luck. 
I mean I did generate a couple of thousand vanity adresses with Niak in the beginning, but still ... 
Verheyen is a dutch/belgian last name and close to my own last name. 
And I had fucking 11 BTC when their combined total was worth about 70 EUR, and during an episode of mental illness (I was in a mental hospital for about 4 months) I gave em all away to a stranger on the internet, because my mind stopped working properly. Still sour ...

We don't need segwit. We need a segway to abandon this thread with. But I like your MMA style of causing havoc. Exactly what this community needs to revolve everything, an MMA fight between Roger Ver and Greg Maxwel.  But if might take three years before we would have consensus on the size of the gloves to wear.
