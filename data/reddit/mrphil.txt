This is an interesting perspective and at first glance I’d assume the network would agree to increase difficult to compensate. But maybe there is something special about QC that fundamentally breaks the computational hardness assumption?

Consumption taxes would make everyone’s lives much easier, but I expect that’s the more challenging path politically.

My view is Bitcoin has the longest track record and always will assuming no serious flaw is discovered and exploited.  Satoshi left behind 1 million coins in beginning of Bitcoin, or about $10 Billion assuming 1 BTC = $10k.  It seems reasonable to assume that these coins act as a prize encouraging people to find a flaw in Bitcoin because a $10 Billion payout is worth the trouble.  This reward coins goes up over time, increasing the certainty the code is secure and the theory Bitcoin is built on works.  Those coins act as a proof of security because they've never moved.

Sounds like you could sell a part of your stash and live off it and instead pursue anything that you find Interesting.

I think the short answer is the: spot and point price determination method agreed to in the contract.  I assume that CME standard contract ignores the new fork in that determination but others could do something different.

Maybe you need a cause, like raising awareness of non-tradition gambling additions like day trading, loot boxes, etc?
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:13:03
If forks aren’t part of the spot or point price calculation method it doesn’t matter to the contract.

Cash settled means you’ll take your profits at the end of the contract in cash instead of the commodity, bitcoin in this case.  
Naked shorting means selling the commodity without actually owning it vs a farmer does not naked short because he has or is growing the commodity.

Yeah, it's not magically fast, just much faster.  It's certainly not something I fully get yet.  But in my mind, it wasn't square root?  I think it's 2^(n/2)  and classic computers are 2^n but square root would be n^1/2, right?  My math skills are meh.  That fits my thinking with entanglement though, because, for each answer you find, it also reveals the entangled answer, so n/2.

You are looking for a man named Vizzini

My poor understanding of a quantum computer is this:
Because of entangling, by solving one grid in a formal's result matrix you get access to all the results.   To me, that means if you have the result you are looking for, then it will be possible to inexpensively backtrack to the inputs because it's more like looking up the answer than "cracking" with brute force.

What would be better, to use money that buys less at the end of the month or more?

He's actually got it backwards.  Thank GOD its complicated.  That is what the terrorists aren't good at.  There are so many complicated things out there that are vulnerable, but  because they are not sophisticated we are safe!

Actually, all I was thinking was, if I was facing loosing a 1/3 of my paycheck by the end of the month, I sure as hell would move anything I didn't spend on payday into Bitcoin.

Inflation doesn't mean the price of the money went up.  Inflation means the price of *things* goes up.

Yeah, notice my used of the word 'could' in the title.

Have you considered what the World GDP is?  I think was over $70 Trillion last year.  How much GDP ends up in cash?  Hard to say, that's what's weird about money, because time is part of the value.  Money spent today is worth less than money spent tomorrow, usually, sometimes it goes the other way.

Not any more or less absurd than:
- The Venezuela bolívar inflating 36% a month
- Hyperinflation getting so bad in Zimbabwe printing One Hundred Trillion Dollar Bills
- US Dollar's valve dropping 99% since the Federal Reserve was created in 1913
There are a lot of people in the world that have connected the dots between the crappy crash boom cycle in the world and the stupid paper money we use that is manipulated by the politicians.  Bitcoin isn't perfect, but is better than the poison that is FIAT currency.  That's all you are seeing, a crowd running to the light at the end to the tunnel.
Not all "parabolic charts" are doomed to crash.  Every animal and planet you see around you is part of the most parabolic of parabolic growth curves you can image, it's called life.

If the US has proven anything with it's current monetary policy, it's that people will accept money backed by "nothing."
