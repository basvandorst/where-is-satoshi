Why is it everytime I try to type bitcoin on Android it autocorrects it to Buffoon?
Getting really sick of it man.
@_date: 2014-11-03 22:06:11
I love circle and I have been waiting for this app. It's the first site I have been able to buy btc at and have it in my account within seconds.
Opening my account was simple too.
Trust me I have tried many many exchanges and this is by far the best.
Hope that the app soon becomes available to the UK.

So does a multisig wallet work in the same way of Bitcoin Core?
Are they programs / applications you download.
How do you get your coins from Core to the multisig?
Should I forget about paper?
@_date: 2014-11-15 22:52:10
I don't have ubuntu, just windows. I want to change from Bitcoin Core because it takes up to much disk space and slows down Windows.
My password isn't that strong, I use it in a few different places but I wouldn't want to get keylogged or something and get them stolen.
I have no idea what bip38 keys are, sorry.

For me Circle has been the only one that enabled me to transfer funds to my account and convert to Bitcoin the same day.
Also, the account wasn't that hard to set up.
I literally spent over a year trying to buy bitcoin reasonably cheaply and tried to setup accounts on many exchanges but the amount of info they required was just ridiculous.
I am UK based btw.
Anyway, as far as your suggestions.
As already mentioned, localbitcoins is a very expensive way to buy bitcoin although if you really want to start using I guess it's a way.
Buying a miner is pointless these days. Sure I could maybe get small amounts of bitcoin doing so but I would spend more than the btc would be worth.
Using btc sites and scanning QR codes is a waste of time. People want like 1BTC not 0.0001 btc.
Where I live there isn't a bitcoin ATM for about 50 miles and that's in a local Cex store.
@_date: 2014-12-16 21:50:17
I don't see a Bitcoin option. Only ccard or PayPal
@_date: 2014-11-10 11:23:56
I have been using Bitcoin for a year. I use Bitcoin Core. I want to 
1./ Keep my Bitcoins safe (paper)
2./ Move away from Bitcoin Core to something that doesn't use GB of space
How do I do both of these?
@_date: 2014-11-10 11:20:12
Keep the user safe? All I wanted to do was send £1.05 20 miles down the road. 
Actually it took a bit longer than 20 seconds, more like a couple of minutes and if I had been on a mobile device it would have taken double that.
@_date: 2014-11-09 22:56:46
But how can this work in a real life marketplace. Surely businesses can't wait 30 minutes for confirmations?
@_date: 2014-12-11 22:47:19
Ok I downloaded mycelium but how do I copy the btc address from my mobile device to my laptop.
The only way I can see is type it out manually but that must be prone to errors.
@_date: 2014-11-09 23:00:38
I bought a casascius bitcoin for my daughters 3rd birthday. I got is framed with a note enclosed.
The note described how to redeem the btc and when it could be redeemed (her 18th bithday).
@_date: 2014-11-03 22:16:21
I couldn't find it by searching circle for bitcoin either. I had to follow the link in this thread.
@_date: 2014-11-25 00:01:48
Reddit uses should create a rickroll type for this.
@_date: 2014-11-09 23:04:41
Well the btc has now arrived. Time to get tipping.
@_date: 2014-11-15 23:42:55
Ok, maybe I shouldn't have mentioned Electrum... is this just for ebuntu?
I don't have that..
What I meant was an alternative to Core that means I don't need to store the whole blockchain.
@_date: 2014-11-17 23:12:42
That is actually fucking amazing.

I think multibit would give it a run for its money. Best wallet I have used.

I love Cex.

Anyone used bitcoin with takeaway.com recently?
I just tried to order and although the bitcoin option is available. I don't get redirected to any payment processor.
@_date: 2015-01-17 21:25:36
Nice experience buying online using btc from Cex. Very smooth.

Bitbargain.Co.UK is good too.
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:33:03
Count me in if I can buy it on the 24th instead. I will get a nice curry from takeaway.com

I think it's 
@_date: 2017-03-08 22:25:43
I will try and remember this for future. Not sure why but it was a regular transfer from Multibit to Bter.
I have sent hundreds from Multibit to various places before.  Normally I see the transaction immediately and it's processed within an hour or so.
Can different companies specify what is a low transaction fee?
@_date: 2016-06-21 22:08:13
So I guess no-one from Strip4Bit is around hmmm
@_date: 2016-06-22 21:54:07
How does one browse items on Openbazaar? what is the web address? I went to the .org site and it was just info and a link to download the source code.

I live in the UK and don't ask me why but I needed to send the equivalent of 6eur to Estonia. Cost £25..
I was actually told by the teller to try western Union or moneygram instead lol
@_date: 2018-06-19 23:32:29
Everyone that bought bitcoin in Dec and Jan this year should just sell up and fuck off.
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:15:02
I was never very good at Hodling. I preferred to buy stuff.

Cool, so Satoshi was staying at the Holiday Inn in Trafford Park.
@_date: 2019-10-05 20:21:27
To be honest, I feel like I have done alright out of it, I got in around 2013 buying at about £130.
I had 4 at one point using them to buy takeaways and such stuff.
The price increases have paid for holidays, Quadcopters, car repairs and my mortgage for the last 5 years.
Unfortunately I sold the last of it at about £8300 a couple of months ago.
My daughter still has a casascius that I got her for her birthday years ago.
@_date: 2019-10-05 23:37:37
Best answer.

Can you explain how long I will be waiting then please 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:14:50
Panic over the bitcoins are now showing on lbc however on electrum it seems to be stuck.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:23:14
I'm using Electrum
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:29:41
In 2013 the price was like 120 before rocketing to like 1200 in November.
A 10x increase.
Earlier this rear we were at 1k and we are close to 10x that.
By December it had crashed to half that value.
Based on previous I reckon we will see a max $8000 with a crash to 4k in mid December.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:17:24
pfft. How much more patient do I need to be.
Imagine I was stood in a shop wanting to buy a fab ultra 4k HD TV and the shop keeper was like this set is only £3999 and I was like can I pay by bitcoin and he said of course sir.
I scanned my QR code and we waited for a confirmation.
The shop keeper then did that awkward thing where they keep glancing at the device waiting for the transaction to confirm before after about 2 minutes saying "huh. New technolgy eh?"
After about 5 minutes we both just shrug our shoulders and I walk out of the store not really knowing whether I have actually bought a TV I can't yet watch or not..
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:44:19
I think I am pretty much on day 3 and still no sign of getting this transaction confirmed. Something is seriously wrong
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:13:45
I have no idea. I never expected an issue as I have sent many btc from electrum without an issue. The most I would normally wait is around 1 hour.
@_date: 2015-07-12 21:39:27
When I scan the QR code with Mycelium it crashes mycelium, don't know why..

So when I was buying curry and pizza back in 2014 what was that?
Admittedly I don't see many TV salesmen offering bitcoin as a payment method but I should be able to buy things instantly. Surely that is the whole point of digital currency.

The way I see it the guy spent all his money on hookers and booze or something and went 3000 euros + into the red. He's now frustrated because he has to pay it back.

I think we are at panic rather than disbelief. Therefore we have a lot further to go.

If the world really did turn to shit and there was no electricity for months on end then no one would care about bitcoin... or cash ... or gold...
The only things people would care about are cigarettes, alcohol, guns and food.

Fuck em. There's a billion just like them.

How the fuck you going to buy more BTC?

Apparently the money in your bank is secured by the financial ombudsman which is basically an insurance policy to protect you from a bank run.

@_date: 2015-03-20 21:29:47
It doesn't mention on the site that you accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-12 00:07:49
Yeah, I can hardly believe it myself. I have owned bitcoin since 2013 and I am a believer that it's the future of money.
With the halving coming soon I figured now would be a good time to buy.
I won £8mil+
@_date: 2016-05-12 00:16:05
I know how to buy bitcoin from circle and localbitcoins. I can but and sell at circle but I never thought I would be wanting to buy a quantity so big.

Umm, you seem to have forgotten about Circle..?

Works great and I love the idea.
@_date: 2015-02-25 23:51:37


I have never heard of Kaltura before. Can you integrate Kaltura into Wordpress and can Kaltura be used to accept Bitcoin for on demand videos like watchmybit?

@_date: 2016-07-08 22:15:27
These are out of control. I have another one wallet.blokchain which links to blockchain-legacy-wallet.space
or some nonsense.
Apparently I was ip banned after one visit so they know what they are doing.
@_date: 2016-07-03 19:29:58
I don't really get this?
Is the number of bitcoins you hold not relative to value?
So for example if you have $500 of bitcoin today you would have around 1 bitcoin.
But if the market crashed tomorrow to $250 you would own 2 bitcoins?
So owning 21 bitcoins is depending on the current market price is it not? The 21 bitcoins you buy today might only be worth 18 bitcoins tomorrow?
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:54:22
Don't know, I have 2 bitcoin and I was only trying to send 0.1btc.
The bitcoin hasn't sent at all as it doesn't show in transaction history.
I have tried playing around with the fees but could do with some help as to how to get it right.
@_date: 2017-06-05 17:56:11
It's fine now. I had tried to send the same amount to the same address multiple times as I thought it hadn't sent because it wasn't showing in the electrum transactions. I have only just started using it, previously used Multibit and the transaction always showed instantly.
I guess I was a bit impatient.
