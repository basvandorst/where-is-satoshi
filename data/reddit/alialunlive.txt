it didnt drop to 6K$
I was telling everyone that it won't fall bellow 6K$ and if it does, I'm going to buy triple the BTC I already have lol.
But as expected, it didn't hit 6K$.

Well the way he was correcting him is really important in this context I guess. Don't think that calm and advisable comment would be removed and/or banned. Maybe word from the other side as well would help to explain it. Remember that the storyteller is always the innocent one in his story.
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:35:20
Laughing in just 0,011 BTC.
I think we're going bellow 6K really soon.
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:26:56
There are cards.
@_date: 2018-06-21 02:59:15
No it didn't
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:11:24
Well maybe you're right, I'm on neither side because I don't know facts.
@_date: 2018-06-23 11:47:56
I'm buying as low as posible.
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:04:52
I feel like advertisement is not allowed in this subreddit? Also price or anything about money around bitcoins should not be discussed here. Just look at the "Submit text NOT about price" button.
@_date: 2018-06-19 04:27:30
Yes, we're just starting new cycle, best time for buying.
@_date: 2018-06-23 11:42:30
Yeh, bought triple the bitcoin I had as I promised.
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:48:56
Get fucked? What? Noone's fucked, it's just the time to buy. Who didn't sell during the last growth is too greedy or is long term investor that doesn't care about short term drops.
@_date: 2018-06-19 17:00:45
Market price is not about people selling and buying but about the volume of people that want to sell and buy. When there are a lot of people that want to buy, selling people would rise the price because with higher need you can sell things more expensive and still find buyer. And vice versa.
@_date: 2018-06-21 11:58:33
I'm telling you it didn't, gosh. Maybe it did for your walet but global BTC price didn't drop under 6K$, search for facts, for minimum price last month.
@_date: 2018-06-23 11:41:28
Wait what?!
I've registered to coin base like a month ago, uploaded JUST my driving licence and my limit is 100,000€.
@_date: 2018-06-14 17:11:47
BTC will not fall bellow 6k this crysis. Everyone who knows even a little about market and economy knows that. In next few months we'll see price recovery and then another inflation will happen.
BTC market already had at least 3 cycles of inflation and crysis and it'll have another just like any freaking market in the world.
People are buying without knowledge and then selling in panic and that just makes the market work in this "cycle" way.
Since BTC market is unregulated it will just follow natural market progression.
Just don't panic when it's falling and buy more. Every time it falls just buy some. And every time it grows sell some (not all). That'll keep you safely in profit.

When someone is trying to scam people thinking that they are as stupid as he is... This is the most transparent scam I've seen in my life.
@_date: 2018-06-23 19:34:42
It's falling because people like you sold and hurt the market.
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:01:51
Example of some fact that got banned? Haven't seen any lately, just scams and aggresive posts are deleted by my opinion.
@_date: 2018-06-24 12:13:25
I'm not investor at all, I own bitcoin to pay with it, to support the technology and idea. I don't give a shit about price.
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:30:49
Well, give me money to do that and I'm all yours.
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:39:44
Pssst, don't tell everyone lol.
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:41:33
He is asking me to do that, why should I bother?
@_date: 2018-06-23 03:46:51
I'm buying LUL, why would anyone sell?
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:56:02
Yeh, as usual after spike. It won't drop lower that it was before thought. And in some months spike will come back STRONGER THAN BEFORE.
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:52:24
Did you really fall for that. it's the beauty of crypto, when you put your hand off it you cannot control it anymore. Just get used to your loss.
@_date: 2018-06-24 12:10:46
Doesn't even know that dollar as any other currency in the world is changing its value constantly as well :facepalm:
If you hate this community just leave, we don't want people like you here, you're not making any good to anyone. Just jerking off your ego.
@_date: 2018-06-23 16:42:37
I have 1K buy limit from credit card and 100K buy limit from euro wallet on coinbase. And 100K sell limit.
@_date: 2018-06-14 17:32:56
Give this guy a bitcookie
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:16:46
What do you mean by "without using friend"? Just sell them via some market service.
@_date: 2018-06-24 12:19:50
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:52:27
It's not that bad for such a drop honestly.
@_date: 2018-07-03 10:44:10
No, you should sell low and buy high... What are even those questions, we have no idea when you bought. I believe in you, you can think this through by yourself instead of filling this subreddit with price-oriented trash.
