I feel like one of those people.
Thanks bitcoin.

That’s good, realism will get you the money not blind optimism. But it’s hard to not be excited about legal bitcoin is and what it can become.

Cheaper fees, cards don’t have “pre-paid card” written on the front and they are backed by an actual bank unlike many of the crypto-debit cards.

It’s everyone on that exchange willing to sell their particular token or coin for that price. 
You will usually find the largest buy walls at psychological levels like 1,000 , 10,000 , 15,000 (round numbers) and when they get “destroyed” it means the buying power has taken that wall down and we are on the way to next one, although it’s never guaranteed once the wall is gone that we won’t go back under it.

I can invite you to the slack if you have any questions 
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:19:53
That’s what I’m trying to do but “google” wasn’t much input lol

They have a wallet that allows you to spend multiple currencies, I don’t think there is another crypto debit card that lets you spend 8+ different crypto currencies
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:41:41
How did you even find this lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:51:32
They are adopting it, they are taking their time though.
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:14:27
Are you in the US? Centra is certainly a better option if you are as they are US based

I have searched and read, what’s wrong with asking other bitcoin users for anything I may have missed?
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:05:13
You can purchase from the official Ledger website with Bitcoin.

Please for the love of god do a roger ver scene with his face getting red and everything.
Maybe chuck in a wholesome reference to Andreas getting donated bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:47:16
Haha this is so spot on
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:11:59
CentraTech is the competitor they are talking about in the article.
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:51:18
IMO Centra has a lot more to offer.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:12:15
Have you seen Richard hart vs roger ver?
@_date: 2018-02-18 07:29:44
They don’t ship worldwide.
@_date: 2017-05-18 11:55:47
From my view, right now is a bad time to buy but I feel like it will drop again soon, can you give me an estimate of what is considered a good low for Bitcoin right now?
@_date: 2017-05-18 12:17:01
@_date: 2017-05-18 12:07:49
That's what I'm looking for, I had the chance to but when it was $20 a Bitcoin but I was too young, I'm not missing another chance.
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:31:29
