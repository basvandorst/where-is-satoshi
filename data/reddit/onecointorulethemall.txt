Add a x% fee or get a partnership with a major wallet provider as a sponsor eg: coinbase, xapo, etc. So xapo or coinbase would pay the atm owner 5000 to 10000 or more satoshis per transfer from the atm to their wallets while keeping a "0% fee" transfer for the user. The minimum amount could be 5$ or more to avoid spam. The user could log in to an escrow account where he deposits the funds which will later be sent to a xapo or a coinbase wallet after the fund reaches 5$.
Log in process could be like this: The atm should have a camera that scans a qr on the mobile phone of a user representing the wallet address that will get the funds after the minimum amount is reached.

This might be silly.
Add a "Change to Bit" machine.
Search your pockets for quarters from a change and turn them to satoshis.
You might have 0.75$ on you and would like to add that amount to your wallet.
To prevent loss of funds because you have to pay ~5 cents  as a standard transfer, you could add the exchanged amount to a Change to Bit account to add more funds later and then send those funds to your bitcoin wallet.
Or just send 0.75$ instantly and get 0.70$.
I don't know if this already exists.

Step 1: Buy bitcoin and hold it instead of buying cheap mining equipment.
If you do get mining equipment, try slushpool.com or ghash.io .
They are not worth it if you are mining with less than 4TH/s and the price of electricity is too high in your country, if you want to get back at least the money that you paid for your device.
You could mine some altcoins and then exchange those for bitcoin. That is not a guarantee that you will ever make a considerable profit.
I do not own any mining equipment because the ones that matter(High TH/s and energy efficient) are too expensive.
Moreover, with the ever increasing difficulty level, the amount of bitcoin that you mine today with a 4TH/s miner will be less 2 weeks or a month from now, but your electricity cost will be the same.

Your payment will be cancelled after a few days.
You will not be charged in any way.
Use localbitcoins or get a SEPA account.

This happens on some unsecured wi-fi networks. Use mobile data or use another hotspot.

How much is the fee for such a transfer? Is there a minimum or maximum amount that can be withdrawn? Is it a SEPA transfer, or can I withdraw to any debit card?

It was ok.
I got up to 220k satoshi.
Then lost it all.
It was fun. :)

Make it cpu only, asic resistant. Share the reward instantly by the amount of work done by every cpu for each block time, all over the world. Send the rewards through a separate channel in order to not slow down the network.
