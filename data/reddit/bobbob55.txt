That’s not how software development works. If you double the number of developers, you’ll get 0.5 amount of work done the first months. The new guys need to be tough, helped and be allowed to make mistakes. Eventually you’ll get 1.75 efficiency increase. 
I just made up those numbers, but you get the idea. Throwing in more devs at an overdue project is a classic upper management mistake.

You understand that a segwit block is segregated? One part (main/base part) of the block contains the transaction data (coins in, coins out, nSequence etc), while the segwit extension contains only witness data. 
New transactions fit in the main/base part. By segregating the witness (moving it to the extension) you can fit more transactions in the main block. This peaks at about 1.7MB (base+witness) in a segwit block.
When you start to exceed 1.7MB block the weight formula starts to eat away the base block in favor of witness. Thus a 3.7MB segwit block fits significantly fewer transactions than a 1.7MB block. Just look at the testnet blocks.  
A good non-troll source for this is BIP141

Except they don't benifit because they are competing with artificial segwit discount.

Yelling bullshit is not pointing out errors. Keep on parroting your idols and pretend to be an expert.

If LN is a success you'll be sure to see it on other coins too.

Funny thing, segwit is not an increase unless wallets upgrade 
@_date: 2017-08-09 11:47:25
You show no understanding of what you are talking about. You simply refute my arguments by calling "bullshit" and by means of personal attack. I guess this conversation stops here. 
Enjoy your ignorance. I'm glad you found this place. It's perfect for you. 
Out of curiosity, how old are you?

Am I wrong? Do you understand what you are parroting?
Did you know that segwit doesn't even use the full 1 megabyte it has available? This is where we can fit more transactions. Because of the new magical 4MB limit and the supposedly simplifying weight formula. It incentives fewer, larger transactions rather than many transactions. That's not scaling. 
A 3.7MB segwit block fits fewer transactions than a 1.7MB segwit block.

Are you trying to misunderstand or do you not understand segwit? I don't blame you, it's been oversold. Segwit does indeed have to respect the 1MB main block limit. All extra space gained is only witness space. 
Let me repeat: segwit doesn't even use the full 1MB it has available (by existing consensus limitations). Effect of this wasteful weight formula is that a 3.7MB segwit block fits fewer transactions than a 1.7MB segwit block.

Segwit is optional to support

BIP148 doesn't need to trigger. The futures market is currently saying that 1 BTC =~ 11BCC. So there is value in diverting ~10% hash power to the split, regardless of BIP148. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 18:32:54
It's a clean split. It doesn't harm BTC. You can ignore it if you like and continue to use BTC as before.

It's not scraps and NYA doesn't forbid anyone from mining on an other chain
@_date: 2017-07-17 07:11:58
If someone besides Bitmain publishes a big block then Bitmail will orphan their private chain. There is no premine.

One will have marked dominance, on-chain scaling AND L2. The other will have bunch of raspberry pies running L2 settlements and no users.
