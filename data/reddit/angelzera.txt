Thank you, I think I get this now, you have explained it/worded it well.
The part about "...that it survives on at least one node, and gets rebroadcast."--how many nodes are there, approx?  It seems like there would be a very high probability that at least one of those nodes would (for whatever random reason) still be broadcasting a given transaction--but I suppose why would a node do so if it's very old...
Do nodes automatically have some preprogrammed criteria?  I would imagine that all but the most technically adept users aren't going around and setting their own node parameters.
Thanks for engaging.

Interesting--but I thought that the limit was 2 weeks before it would get booted from the mempool?  Whereas the situation you've described is more than 14 days.
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:03:49
I see.  But I'm still a bit confused--I want to be clear on what makes the difference between a confirmation that gets booted, and one that just floats forever.  By the description you gave above, doesn't it seem like a low fee Tx could theoretically just float in the mempool forever, if nodes for whatever reason never decide to stop broadcasting that Tx?
Does "amount of time spent in mempool" factor in to this equation somehow?

Can somebody help me with something I've been wondering?  All this talk about LN--it's a safe assumption that if LN takes off/is effective, that a huge number of other coins will then seek to/eventually succeed in implementing it themselves, correct?
Obviously we can make arguments that BTC has the superior dev team--which very well could be true--but the point remains that they can just "copy" LN and apply it to their coins as well...right?

Yeah so in my case it was me sweeping a small paper wallet that I made as an experiment when I first got into crypto, into my Trezor.  I initiated the sweep with Mycelium (which is really wonky on iOS) and Mycelium's "priority" fee ended up coming out to 117ish Sat/B (lol).
Mycelium doesn't allow me to Replace by Fee (this would be me double spending, but with a higher fee the second time, right?) so I'm a bit lost on what to do (aside from simply waiting it out, which is what I'm currently doing)
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:35:14
I see, thank you.  So when you said "the tx will be booted only if it has less than 40sat/B as fee" you meant "booted" as in booted prematurely--prior to the 2 week limit.  But you're saying that ANY tx, no matter what the fee, will eventually booted at the 2 week mark?
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:52:34
I guess to be more specific--since my tx has more than the minimum to be booted, in the event that it isn't confirmed in couple weeks or whatever, what can I do?
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:40:47
I recently initiated a transaction for...117 sat/B or so?  It's been 2 days and it still hasn't been confirmed, so I'm curious--at what point will the tx exit the mempool?  And when it does, is it as if the tx was never broadcast (i.e., the input address will have its coins back)?
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:11:39
If the profit/loss over a time period of less than one day is of concern to you, I'd recommend you covert back to fiat ASAP and abandon this venture, because it's going to be stressful for you.  Especially if you later decide to put in a significant amount of capital into it.
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:30:03
So, do we have Bitcoin Gold now?  How can I sell all of mine ASAP?

When I look up the address mentioned, why does Blockchain.info say that it only holds 5BTC (and has only ever received approximately 5 BTC)?
What am I missing here?  They say that is the address within which he's holding the money.
@_date: 2017-09-19 02:22:12
When I scan my paper wallet's public address with Mycelium (after clicking "Cold Storage"), it informs me that "This is a public address with [x] USD."
However, when I scan the address of my Coinbase bitcoin wallet, it says "Not a valid bitcoin address or payment request." 
Now, I thought both were the same thing--QR codes for public addresses of wallets.  What is making Mycelium unable to recognize the coinbase wallet, but able to read the balance/recognize my paper wallet's public address?
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:49:00
Also just like...who cares...I have no idea why these threads exist
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:50:45
What about Bitstamp?  I assume the same thing?
Also, when you say that the trades will get reported, I assume this would mean I would need to declare them as such when filing my returns?  Or do people just ignore this?
@_date: 2017-09-17 12:16:09
I should add here that this is facilitated with keeping BTC across multiple paper wallets (as their final destination, to be stored there indefinitely as I hold the coin)
Though with HD enabled wallets, I don't know if it's even trackable to begin with.  That said, I just prefer paper wallets regardless for security reasons.
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:39:11
The fees aren't *awful*.  They're like...1.5% if I recall correctly?  For bank account purchases?
You can get 0.25% through something like Bitstamp, but that requires depositing money with them through a bank wire, which is both a MAJOR pain in the ass, and incurs bank fees.
I think coinbase is fine for buying, just that there's no reason to not immediately move coins out 1 min after you receive them.

Newly into crypto--want to purchase some BTC to get my feet wet.  Very wary of using anything that requires identification (is this paranoia, or is it justified?).
Weighing my options for purchase at the moment.  There is an ATM nearby, but the vig is around 22% (lol).  I also don't know if it requires ID/fingerprint or whatever, but figure this level of ID is okay (vs. something like an exchange, which seems less than desirable if autonomy is my goal)?
There's also LocalBitcoins as an option as well.  I suppose my main concern is that in the event crypto blows up (or, rather, the USD implodes), I don't like the idea of the govt. knowing that I possess X amount of BTC.
Any thoughts or tips?
@_date: 2017-09-19 13:36:25
yeah good stuff--i mean really you could just be sending it into a mycelium as you wait (does the coinbase mobile app allow you to send BTC from your wallet?  I would assume so but have never used), but unless you're sitting on some huge amount it's almost certainly fine in the short term
@_date: 2017-09-13 05:36:56
I posted this as a topic a day or two ago, but it didn't generate much traction.  I apologize if this isn't the place to post it, but I'm super interested in hearing the thoughts of those more experienced with crypto than I am regarding this.
"Now, hear me out here. I'm new to crypto, but once I realized how it worked (roughly a week) ago, it seems I can't stop reading about it whenever I have the time to do so.  
I'm well aware the government could never stop bitcoin transactions or ownership. They could never do anything to harm the core technology.
My question: in the (hypothetical) event that the government goes berserk (some time 5-10 years down the line) and declares that all bitcoin ownership is illegal, that publicly-facing businesses cannot accept payment in bitcoin, how will bitcoin ever overtake fiat for good?
My thoughts on this are that in the event the USD (or whatever fiat currency) begins to suffer the effects of inflation/reduced real purchasing power, people will naturally gravitate toward crypto as the preferred means of conducting business--the preferred unit of account.
But if all "official" business--paying for big purchases like a home, or paying one's taxes--is red-flagged the moment it is conducted in BTC...how do we overcome this?
I'm sure there's a solution here, but I'm having trouble drawing it up right now. Perhaps some nakamotoinstitute articles I should read? I'm trying to imagine a hypothetical past where the government declared the Internet illegal in the 1980s--what would have happened as a result, in the 40 years that followed?"

Only in the sense that your keys are not distributed, and remain within your (and only your) control.
The beauty of paper wallets is that, if created securely, they are utterly insulated from electronic thievery.  My biggest fear is not a hacker stealing my coin--it is a fire in my apartment building.
@_date: 2017-09-26 02:36:18
Ah, the fabled platinum bitcoin.  Mr. Satoshi has been looking for this, but you may consider giving it to Caesar's Legion or the NCR as well...or even keeping it for yourself
@_date: 2017-09-28 04:55:21
this makes no sense, you can invest any amount of fiat in btc (btc is more finely divisible than the dollar is, so this is true even down to cents)
regardless of what you invest, your % return will remain the same.  would you pass up a +EV investment opportunity because others can afford to engage in the bet more vigorously?
% return is % return be it on a $10 investment or a million
@_date: 2017-09-19 14:54:54
Yes.  You (and only you) are given the 12-word mnemonic, and it is only stored on your phone.  Contrast this with Coinbase, where your private key is held by the company itself--really, it is their coin, not yours, until you take it out of the account.
I highly recommend getting a mobile wallet and transferring your funds into it the moment any get put into your Coinbase wallet.
I should note that although I'll probably get a Trezor for the convenience at some point soon, paper wallets are a very low tech (yet high security) option, if you make them securely.  Unfortunately, for some users, the steps taken in creating one can seem a bit tricky (though, really, they're not), and so something like a Trezor is a very user friendly alternative.
(For what it's worth--here are the steps in creating a secure paper wallet, summarized:  )
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:28:41
Is there any theoretical concerns with me buying my BTC from Coinbase but always immediately transferring the coin off Coinbase, into Mycelium, and then from there into my offline paper wallet?
I.e., would I have fear of being chased down for taxes, etc., down the line?  Up until now I've only used cash deposits from LocalBitcoins as well as bitcoin ATMs.  
@_date: 2017-09-19 06:53:31
good stuff mate
just please, please, transfer your funds to an external wallet (paper wallet, hardware wallet, hell even mycelium/any wallet that gives you control of your private keys).  i'm reading way too many of these posts that seemingly indicate users that leave the funds in coinbase and use it as their wallet
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:16:22
So, is 2X bound to happen?  I know it seems really unpopular whenever it's talked about, but is it true that ~80% of the hashing power (in the form of the big miners) will support it?  If that's the case, how can we possibly prevent it coming to fruition?
I really hate the fact that it seems another fork is inevitable.  Nothing could be worse for making BTC accessible and understandable to the common person.
@_date: 2017-10-02 01:07:31
I hold the vast majority of my BTC on paper wallets.  If the hard fork occurs, how will I claim my altcoins?  
I assume the process would be similar to how I'd extract my coin to begin with--that is, find a wallet that supports the alt, and sweep the alt into that wallet.  Is this correct?
@_date: 2017-09-19 13:33:37
Lots.  I personally use Mycelium for my mobile wallet.
@_date: 2017-09-30 03:02:38
Good points.  Would you care to give me some of the arguments that are in support of 2x?  Even if you don't personally support it, it would be helpful to hear them.
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:10:07
Haven't signed up with GDAX yet, for some reason after providing my info the site said something like "cannot confirm this identity through public records."
The % differences we're talking here are pretty minor unles you're talking really high trade volume.  1.5% vs. .25% is a difference of $12.5 on a 1000 USD purchase.
Headache factor is also very real for those of use that aren't dropping 5 figure purchases regularly.
@_date: 2017-09-21 18:13:49
Anyone?  This is killing me...I'm so curious as to why this distinction is occurring

Couldn't tell you--just began tracking bitcoin and learning about crypto in the past year or so.  It's completely captivated me since and I can't seem to stop trying to learn more.
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:59:51
I'm of the belief that anyone holding &gt;1000USD or so should buy a hardware wallet and not think twice about doing so.  $90 is a very small price to pay for the terrific security they provide.
I used to recommend paper wallets more often but I now reserve that recommendation only for extremely experienced users.  
@_date: 2017-10-02 01:16:47
It's not so much a matter of care/not_care as much as it is a matter of determining the extent to which the market has been given sufficient time and informational exposure such that it can "digest" the event ahead of time.
Look to the bitcoin cash incident--people were expecting a big drop, but none occurred.  The China news happened out of nowhere, and so it resulted in a negative shock.  The November event has been talked about extensively, and will continue to be talked about extensively, and so I don't believe it's going to cause much of a negative price shock.
@_date: 2017-09-17 12:13:49
localbitcoins is relatively anonymous if you're using something like cash deposit.  there's a bit of a grey area in the sense that if I'm continually making &gt;1000 USD cash deposits to some random company at my local bank branch, I imagine that would raise some flags, to someone, at some point.
what i do is purchase 1000 or so USD in BTC at intervals using local bitcoins.  however...i also purchase a bit via Bitstamp and record it, with the full intention of paying taxes on it.  in my naive view, I figure that if I'm reporting gains on 2500 USD of BTC (that was purchased via Bitstamp), there isn't a ton of reason to expect that I have another 15,000 purchased incrementally via more anonymous methods
@_date: 2017-10-20 13:43:27
Mycelium app on iOS glitching for me--no ability to switch to any currency denomination aside from BTC (and mBTC and bits)--no ability to switch to any exchange rate, the exchange rate page is totally blank.
Is anyone else experiencing this?
@_date: 2017-10-02 01:04:24
or, it won't go down at all because of so many investors in the space thinking along the same lines as this.  if everyone is anticipating a lull, the selloff required to actually lower the price will never occur.
it's hard to tell what will happen, price wise
