I keep a small percentage of my portfolio bch. I call it my "in case I'm an idiot stock". I believe in btc, but I believe in the cryptocurrancy market before btc, and so while I may be convinced bch will collapse I am also confident in my ability to mess up this sort of decision.
My worry is coinbase collapsing due to insider trading violations. That would devastate the market like we haven't seen since Mt.G

The one question I have with this device (despite owning one, I know I'm an uninformed investor) if ledger the company were to collapse in anyway similar to the exchange that desolved would I still be able to get access to my Bitcoin?

Stock markets will go up in the short term because this bill was great for the wealthy, but it's going to cause a massive recession in the US over the next few years. I for one will be moving as much of my USD into bitcoin or other currencies as I can.

That's what I said last night at 16.6 :( will be at least two weeks before I have the funds to drop another good investment. Ripple really helped keep my portfolio from completely being trashed if only they weren't also the evil empire.

I haven't looked into Gemini much yet but I'm wanting to go elsewhere from coinbase for my USD to crypto transfers so I'm interested. At first glance though it seems they only deal in btc and eth. While BTC is still king, I wish it had xrp and litecoin so I didn't have to transfer between exchanges so much

I've been telling my girlfriend this is the Christmas of Bitcoin. We will continue to see a steady climb until then. I see big change potential somewhere around the 27-28th as people decide whether to sell or hodl gifted btc. Could also jump with younger people who get money as gifts invest it. 
If it doesn't take a giant dip then, than my stupid guy on the internet prediction will be a 20-40% dip mid January to March. Hopefully I'll be able to buy during them.

Is this true? I'm sorry to essentially all the same question twice, but I'm intelligent enough to know that I'm an idiot, especially when it comes to crypto currency. Can I really buy a trezor use my 24 word seedphrase and get access to my ledger account? Would this also work with say "blockchain.info" or other online wallets?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:08:24
I really think this is two parts, 1 people have made a decent amount of money from crypto in the past few months/weeks, some are very likely cashing out to spend on holidays. Secondly big investors may be waiting to see what happens with the coinbase insider trading. It can't be understated how big of an effect that would have on the market as a whole.

Or we could just drop our military budget to that of the 2nd highest funded and actually prosecute tax evasion so that 99% of us can get real tax relief rather than cover the bill for the 1%

Ready your downvotes libertarians, there is merit to limiting how much wealth one person can possess. When poverty and homelessness are rampant and Jeff Bezos has wealth valued over 100 billion dollars society is in trouble. The US built all of its infrastructure and become the wealthiest country in the history of the human species upon the back of 80% tax rates for the wealthiest. It wasn't until Republican rule chose to attack the pillars of what built this country in favor of consolidating wealth to only the elite of elites did we begin to see the mess we have now. Crumbling infrastructure, lack of living wages, mass incarceration, out of control military spending are all easily blamed on the party of sexual assault and Nazi empowerment.

Haha not like that. I'm happy with my simple Excel sheet that says how my coins are performing compared to my other coins. I'm of the opinion that if you're looking at graphs you're just gambling. Still the setup looks cool and if it works for you go for it!

It's completely self made using a bunch of arbitrary conditional formatting to help me decide when to buy/sell to keep my coins balanced. I'll look at it today and see if I can tweak it to be understandable by anyone that didn't expressly write it themselves. Translation, I'll try to add some notes and see if I can put it up here. I'm actually really proud of it and have thought about trying to do this and make a post about it in the past but haven't had reason to.

Possible, I'm not a stock trader so I really don't know. I'm going on the idea that is generally only positive news for btc right now and it's much easier to buy into than traditional stocks. Hopefully I'm right, but in the end it won't matter because we're on our way to the Moon with or without sudden jumps.

The real issue with using bitcoin as a currency right now for me is that I live in the US which does not recognize it as a currency. I purchased my bitcoin within this past year which means I would need to pay the 39% short term capital gains tax on the increased value from 3500. 
Not an accountant but I believe that means, If I paid my $100 utility bill in btc and the current price is 7000 I would owe the 100 plus $20 in taxes plus the typical $3 transfer fee.
There is a bill currently being pushed to apply capital gains taxes only on transactions over $600 to help with this issue. Once that or something similar happens I am far more likely to make regular payments via bitcoin. Currently I do use it on bovada as that's the only way to make online sports wagers in the US

Title is wrong. That's what makes crypto-currencies the way of the future. While btc is number 1 and it's not very close at the moment it is not the only 24 hour option.

Looking back, major events have caused 20-30% dips. I expect when we cross 10k sometime in the near future that it will dip back to 8.9-9.2 the likelihood of it ever dropping below 8.5 again is pretty low. Imho

We'll start with shrinking the military budget down to only as much as the second and third highest budgets in the world combined.
A better question would be how will the US continue it's military growth without a dent based system. Somehow the rest of the world seems to continue without spending over 50% of it's "budget" on planes that don't fly and ships that don't float.

To start, we could begin funding education in poor cities. Basing education funds on real estate prices guarantees to keep the poor poor and having to resort to criminal activities to "lift themselves up by their bootstraps" as they say.

The issue for most is the drop happened after the start of the new year. To me the idea that if you trade on coinbase and buy $10 in btc and $10 of eth you owe nothing, but if you buy $20 in btc then $10 of eth with btc you will now owe a tax is completely ridiculous and asinine.
A better example is if you pay $100 to a friend in cash for .1 btc and then trade only on binnance with it you are expected to pay USD tax on something that you had no access to convert to USD. They are giving it an assumed value in USD but in reality is worth $0.

You have this a bit backwards, for the most part Bitcoin users are indifferent to Bitcoin cash users and it is the BCH folks that despite BTC. R/Bitcoin has a tendency to despise BCH but at least that makes some sense at least compared to r/BTC hating BTC. If you mostly follow r/cryptocurrency instead of r/Bitcoin you'll see that most of the saltines you're seeing comes from here or r/BTC.
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:33:36
I definitely fall more on the BTC and an indifferent on BCH. I own some bch but call it my "in case I'm wrong" investment.
My issue always arises from despising r/BTC. I understand its beginning and I get the hate for r/Bitcoin moderators treating bans like this is the_donald but r/BTC has turned into a cesspool of hating on the product its named after. I wish they would just move over to r/bch and shutdown that sub.
