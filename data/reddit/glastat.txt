It's text, it's not like it takes up much storage. I have chat logs from 4 years ago because they were auto logged.

Yeah I'll be surprised if it goes below 800, as that's what it was about before the rapid growth around Dec 21st.. I still buy when I think it's likely to go up (as opposed to a regular schedule), just don't have any plans on selling, so I'll probably pick some up in the low 800s as well.

Must be the same phenomenon that causes people to bring up unrelated politics in a bitcoin thread. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 13:46:58
Same, that's kinda what I do. "If I prep all my lunch this week instead of buying I can put that $ towards btc", etc.
Anyway, thought I'd come back to this comment now lol because I think we're at or close to buying time

Oh. 
I was kinda hoping you'd say like Minnesota. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 19:05:10
Damn, I knew I shut have placed a buy order for like 840 before going to bed.
I'm a little more reluctant to buy much more until my hardware wallet arrives in the mail though, so it's all good.

As a hodler:


neat, the value of my bitcoin is increasing


good thing I'm a hodler. it will probably go back up eventually. maybe I'll buy some more now.
@_date: 2017-01-06 22:16:33
Yeah as a hodler these are just kinda exciting

fuuuck should have bought in the $900s

I mean it's no different than a married couple getting life insurance. Same idea, that's basically what life insurance is for. Only it's weird because OP is talking about his mom and perhaps a better safety net would be getting a job and becoming independent lol.

yeah but how much did he save on his heating bill?
@_date: 2017-01-18 22:29:43
I'm not sure if you're agreeing or disagreeing with me but that's essentially what I'm saying. Right now I don't care about fancy cars or houses. If I had more money I'd spend it doing even more of the same/similar stuff I do now.

Is there a "Beginner's guide to physical wallets" anywhere? I've been using bitcoin for nearly a year so I'm very familiar with acquiring it, wallets (I use Electrum), transferring and receiving it, etc. but I'm completely in the dark about physical wallets. Like what's the difference between paper and hardware wallets? How do each of them work? What are the pros and cons of the different Keepkey, Ledger, TREZOR, etc. wallets? I hear that hardware wallets are more secure - how is that? I'm interested in holding long term so that is of interest to me.

Thanks bud. Just ordered myself a Nano S.

I got into btc the beginning of this year,  &lt;400. Cashed out july 14th I believe (right around the peak coincidentally), then got back in around Sept 1.
I'm playing around with small money, only made about $500 so far, but still I'd say I picked a decent time to enter.  
@_date: 2016-12-29 22:59:30
Any reason on Trezor vs Ledger Nano S? Don't mean to hijack, but I've been on board with bitcoin for about a year now in smaller amounts, and now I think I'm just going to put larger amounts in and hodl instead of trading. So I want a hardware wallet, and I'm having a bit of trouble figuring out the pros and cons between the two, especially for someone like me who is just interested in secure long-term holding rather than daily transactions.
For the past year I've been using Electrum with 2FA (although that was annoying when my phone broke and I know it has its weak points) and written copies of the seed in secure places.

was the IRS not recently doing an investigation into coinbase?
@_date: 2016-12-30 06:02:57
I mean just because I don't agree with it philosophically doesn't mean it's irrational. Are income taxes irrational too? The rationale is the government wants my money and they find ways to take it from me. Some of which I'm ok with, many of which I'm not. Either way I still have to give it to them how they want it.

Every once in a while I think about how rich I'd be if I had invested my hs summer job money into bitcoin and I'm totally fine with it because I'm a well adjusted person. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 01:26:11
My (admittedly loose) understanding is bitcoin is legally treated as property rather than currency, so you would technically have to report it as a capital gain
@_date: 2016-12-09 18:19:43
I used to use circle and was very happy with it but now I'm sticking with Libertyx (which I've used before) and localbitcoins (which I still need to learn how it works).

So like I agree with you that the MSM pushes a lot of propaganda including "fake news" (which is not to say it's the only source of it), but I'm not sure you're effectively communicating your point.

It's driving me crazy that I can't find the example on google but isn't there a famous movie quote where a dude is like "I don't have to, I *GOT* to"? I would have guessed Rocky but this might have been a movie scene I dreamed once.
@_date: 2017-01-18 01:55:53


I don't disagree but getting a sports car is definitely a stereotypical middle age crisis thing to do  
Personally I have no interest in a fancy car or fancy house. If I were rich I wouldn't spend much time at home or in a car.

Out of curiosity how does that work? Are you a "digital nomad"? (edit: I realize I sound like a grandpa when I put it in quotes like that)

Sure and I'm all for dank memes but not in this setting.
Which to be fair I'm not sure calling someone edgy is asking for a legitimate engagement but still you did kinda set the tone first.

Yeah it very much seems like a phrase someone would make up to make them seem cooler lol
