Not sure there is enough ASIC miners available for a 51% attack. 
And enven if they manage to get them, they would probably need to build a Nuclear plant to power such a farm. 
And Bitcoin could still hardfork to protect himself.

Hi Matthew,
Even if it's not an issue for them, it doesn't change my opinion about the sticky topic. Read the "New" section, you will see a lot of topics/questions about the high fee. 
May I ask you to explain me why the high fee are not an issue (if I'm not wrong they are about 15-20$ right now) ?
And when they say it's not an issue, it's mean "as it will be solved is not an issue" or "20$ fee (e.g.) are OK in general and Bitcoin will stay like that (aka Bitcoin should be used only to store value?)".

I would also know what are the next steps for Bitcoin from Core team.
Would be great to have also a draft timeline. This fee / scaling issue can really discourage newcomers interested by Bitcoin.

Thanks Andreas !
You have opened (and you will open) the eyes of a lots of people about the true power of Bitcoin.
I learn so much about Bitcoin &amp; money with your videos. 
Hope to have the change to see you live in Switzerland!

I don't know if BCash is in better position than Bitcoin, but I agree that there is not so much communication from Core team.
Would love to see more communication about the scaling issue, fee, 2018 roadmap (Segwit, LN, etc...). It would be reassuring for new peoples. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:25:24
I agree with you, but Core / LN need to clearly communicate on those solutions. Peoples need to be aware of what is ongoing and how it will solve the issues. 
Currently it's a black box, there is few tweets somewhere, few discussions on github but nothing concrete in public forum like r/Bitcoin. 
The only thing needed now is communications from dev's.

I used Kraken during the year multiple times without any issues.
**BUT** some users reported issue this last two months (fund not credited, unstable, etc...)
And as you can see on their frontpage they admit to have issues:




So better to use another exchange for now. I subscribed on Bitstamp last week, still waiting for my ID validation...
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:14:28
Yep you should be able to do it with Electrum as u/MinerSystems say.
I had the same issue few month ago. :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:43:17
I don't think we need a marketing guys, but just more communication about the next step and how we will handle the fee/scaling issue. 
And this need to be communicated on this sub-reddit / bitcointalk, ...

I wasn't speaking about a PR / education campaign and I agree with you, it's not the job of Core to do education. 
I was speaking about a sticky post, here on r/Bitcoin, with (**e.g.**):
* ELI5 of what is the fee "issue" (How/Why)
* Tool already available to improve the situation (Segwit)
* Ongoing tasks from Core side
* Ongoing tasks from LN side
* Other developments (Schnorr,...)
No need to go in deep, just a topic from "official" guys, updated monthly to inform / reassure peoples. IMO it would require only few hours to write it and 1h a month to update it.
The OP is not the first one to ask:




A sticky would clarify everything for a lot of peoples. 
I believe that Reddit is a good place for such discussions. 
I was not aware of IRC meetings, I will try to found more informations about them. I will also have a look on the github repo. Thanks.

The rescan was done. 
But importaddress has imported 2 address instead of one. I'm wondering why.
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:18:43


I really agree with this question from OP.
I still don't understand why there is no sticky post from Core / LN Dec about the actual fee "issue" and the progress to solve/mitigate them.  
Core / LN Dev could together update a sticky post each 2-4 weeks to inform the communality about the progress and roadmap (e.g Core wallet update with native Segwit ? LN developement progress, other developments, Schnorr, rootstock,...).
Now, there is no visibility on on-going development (yeah, you can maybe found something if you dig on twitter/github...not convenient at all). 
And it would only need max 2 hours a month.

Thanks I will do that, 11 coins flips to get number between 0 and 2047.
Seems to be the best way to do it. 
And Yes! I will definitely test by sending small amount, delete it and recover it. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 16:57:39
Thanks, I will do that.
But the tricky part for me is to generate a seed in a safe way.
@_date: 2018-10-08 20:57:09
Hey, very interesting video.
Question: How it's secure to use a cheap, always offline, android phone to old the funds and to sign transaction? (assuming that you generate your own BIP39 seed with coin flip, protect the phone with a password, never connect it to a computer, etc).
Can it be a viable alternative to hardware wallet? The fact to never have to connect it to any devices seems nice.
@_date: 2018-02-26 18:38:23
I have successfully done my first two trade and Bisq and yes, it's an amazing alternative to centralized exchange!
I encourage you to try it next time you want to buy/sell BTC.

Totally agree,  I live in a country which is probably one of the best in the world in terms of democracies but still, (most of)our political guys are affiliate with big companies (banks, farma, ...).
Money and profits of the big guys will be always preferred to people rights, health, etc..
@_date: 2018-12-17 21:24:12
Thank you, unfortunately now working for me. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 21:39:43
Very nice! Amazing work!

I agree with u/Rmr1881, I'm not using twitter and it's really a blocking point for me. 
Do you have an easy way to create a fake account? They always ask for a phone number, and I don't want to give them my real number...They also block most of the fake email/phone number.
