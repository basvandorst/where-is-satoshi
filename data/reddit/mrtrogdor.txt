I had similar issues when I had 1mbps upload. The node would max out upload and make it look like the connection was down, where in reality requests to the internet were having trouble getting out. Faster speeds became available and with at least 10mbps up I no longer see the issue.
Kinda lame the core client doesn't have a way to directly set a bandwidth limit, but there is a command line switch for limiting how much upload per day.
Tries to keep outbound traffic under the given target (in MiB per 24h), 0 = no limit (default: 0)

TL;DW: This isn't financial advice and I am not a financial adviser. 
Do you own research. 
Past performance is not indicative of future performance.
Agree or disagree to the following questions:
Is there value in a monetary policy based upon savings rather than debt?
Is there value in a censorship resistant, non political means of transferring value around the world?
Is there value in tokenising asset classes and opening them up to the world market, in a way that is independent of monopolistic interests?
If you agree more than disagree, you should probably be saving and/or accumulating crypto assets.
If you disagree more than agree, you should probably be selling if you have not already.

I dont know about allocating an entire paycheck. 
You specify how much pay is being sent to bitwage.
I use them to automate Dollar cost averaging. 
I do know that you can give them any public key, like from a Trezor and they deposit coins direct.
There is a delay, 2-3 days as well after pay is deposited.
I can confirm what u/cointastical is saying, the exchange rate is wonky through them, they email you a report once the coin is sent. EG: spot price is 10400 but bitwages exch rate is somehow 10800 etc.
Strangely though as far as i have seen. If the "Cross Currency Rate" is higher than the current spot from the report, the price tends to catch up to that rate a few day later. 
I call time periods around the middle and end of the months. "the payday pump"

Having to wait 9 days to send Coinbase funds via ACH is the way to go.
Just accept the wait and buy your coins 9 days ahead of when you need them. Use Coinbase Pro if you want lower fees. I think chilling is trying to say the 9 day wait is a consequece of using an on ramp like coinbase. The wait time is typical for the ACH processing that banks use all the time.
Or use something like bitwage to convert some of your pay check into coins.
@_date: 2019-04-19 23:21:29
I do agree 9 days is absurd, when most bank ACH transfers are 3-5 days normally, but it is easy to plan around it, it isn't like bitcoin expires or is going to go anywhere. ^other^than^the^moon.^.^��^��

*What am I missing here?* check out the subreddit, i'm sure people will post a comments how you arent mining bitcoin and or something about garbage altcoin posts not belonging in the bitcoin subreddit.
*Would this work?* This absolutely works but it depends on how much house you are trying to heat. I do this for the winter and you need to have rigs distributed evenly throughout the home, instead of one big one. Do you have a summer? What are you going to do once the seasons turn?
*Anything I should look out for?* If you have never GPU mined before you are going to have to learn a bunch of stuff.
Be aware of he thermostat location, if it thinks its warm the central heat won't kick on as much and then you start getting colder rooms that are far from the rig. Also power consumption. I have a 6 card rx580 rig that only uses 830watts at around 29mh/s per card with bios mods and specific clock settings. running 6 cards stock would overload a 1200w psu and running 10 cards stock would probably overload most residential circuits.
Also you probably are NOT going to heat your house for "free" since it is currently not profitable for even ethereum. Hopefully you have very cheap electric rates.

It is slightly more complicated than a bitcoin full node. Half of the reason is lack of detailed documentation. 
Save a few days of troubleshooting:
Run **Bitcoin Core v.0.17.0** as a full node first. Port forward 8333.
I wasted many days trying to get it to work because all the documentation I have found assumes you just innately know that v.0.17.0 or older is what you should use. NOT 0.17.0.1
If you already have this going, with the full chain synced. You are mostly done.
Make your bitcoin .conf file look like this and restart the node.
    testnet=0
    server=1
    rpcuser=foo
    rpcpassword=bar
    rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
    rpcport=8332
    txindex=1
    zmqpubrawblock=tcp://127.0.0.1:29000

Get Eclair binaries -

    eclair.node-color="49daaa"
    eclair.max-htlc-value-in-flight-msat=10000000000
Port forward 9735 and you should be gtg. **Don't load/spend what you can't afford to lose because you can lose coins on lightning.**
If the Bitcoin core wallet you are using is encrypted and backed up, as it should be.
You need to goto Help &gt; Debug Window &gt; Console and unlock the wallet.
    lockunspent true 
(or restart bitcoin core, this will remove utxo locks)
    walletpassphrase "your super long passphrase goes here" 300
the 300 is in seconds of time your wallet is unlocked.
You then need to start opening channels with other nodes. Good luck.

I don't have any coding skills to speak of and run bitcoin and eclair on Windows. On the other hand, I work in the IT field.
I suppose it depends on how you value your time, and whether you have a proclivity for research and troubleshooting.
If you have spare hardware, can follow online guides and understand port forwarding, you can run a full bitcoin node.
If you know how to edit .conf text files in notepad, you can run eclair lightning.
For me spending my time learning about this stuff is more valuable.
Others might say "ain't got time for dat" and their time is better spent doing other stuff and might pay $300 for the convenience.

Desktop or laptop? laptops tend to have slow 5400rpm drives
What kind of external HDD? external are very frequently 5400rpm laptop drives.
If your external is indeed a 5400rpm drive, that definitely will contribute.
I used to use old laptop drives form my node machines and they are agonizingly slow. God help you if you ever need to -reindex.
What generation of i3? if you have an older i3, with all spinning disks, that would explain a lot.
Windows key pause-break is the shortcut for your system screen and should say what version of i3 you have like i3-6300.
Also, although the [system requirements]( for Windows 10 is low. In practice 4 gigabytes or ram is still pretty low, meaning your pc could be using some hard drive space as temporary ram. Even more so if this machine is your daily driver so to speak.
That in turn is a lot of data being shuffled around by your i3 and it has to wait for the data to be written to your spinning disks.
You may want to consider building or buying a dedicated machine to run your node(s), or upgrading your current machine.

average all the way down! 
For example if you double down, in bitcoin terms, the average cost per bitcoin in AUD is lowered. So once BTC goes back up you can get out sooner, if you want.
Buying .0187 BTC now at $5,387 is $100 and some change.
Average it with your first buy and it would be as if you bought .0374 BTC for 600ish at $15504

I also have a Asus router. 
You should first setup a local static IP for your bitcoin node.
To do this in the Asus router you with need the MAC address of your node's Network connection.
Assuming you are running the node on Windows, you find out your network info by searching for CMD and using the following command
    ipconfig /all
If you are using a wired connection, hopefully, you need to look for the Ethernet Adapter's Physical Address and IPv4 Address in your CMD window.
Make note of those and then login to you router.
In the router LAN settings is a tab for DHCP server. Usually you have 253 automatically assigned local IP addresses for stuff you connect to your router.
Here you can set the IP Pool Starting Address to something like 192.168.1.10, which will tell the router to not use 192.168.1.2 - 192.168.1.9
This becomes your pool of IP addresses that you can assign manually to devices MAC ids within the router.
Under the same DHCP server tab there is a Manual Assignment section that you will need to enable and apply.
Then you add the Client name or MAC address, AKA the Physical Address you noted earlier and the IP you want it to have from your pool, for example 192.168.1.2
You Add and Apply that and then restart your node pc, or 
    ipconfig /release &amp;&amp; ipconfig /renew
It should get that specific IP address if configured correctly. 
Sometimes you need to fully reboot your Asus router before rebooting your pc for this to work.
You can run ipconfig /all again to see if the IP matches what is setup in the DHCP server.
After the static IP is setup, 
You can open the WAN section on the Asus and under the Virtual Server / Port Forwarding tab
Enable Port Forwarding and apply
Then you can add the port forward info for bitcoin.
    Service Name: Bitcoin
    Source Target: can be left blank
    Port Range: 8333
    Local IP: the same IP as your new static IP
    Local Port:8333
    Protocol: Both
Add and Apply
Your router restarts, and then on your bitcoin node you should start seeing more that 8 connections. You now have a bitcoin node.
You can check if the network sees it from  as well.

I feel the need any time the amount exceeds the cost of buying a new hardware wallet, it belongs on a hardware wallet.
In my opinion, there is no good reason to keep coins on an exchange for long term storage, if you have a hardware wallet and secured backups.
In my case I've switched to bitwage, so I don't even have to ask this question. Just have them deposit straight to an address in the hardware wallet.
