This. I don't understand why you'd hold during a dramatic unpredictable downturn.  Get your money back into fiat and minimise losses, then buy back in when it settles.  
I bought last week when I thought the 'correction' was over, and since then sold 90% of my BTC/ETH/etc at an overall loss of about 10% including fees. But I'll buy back in when it's relatively low, and I'll hopefully be able to make that 10% back, without the market having to reach its old heights which could take a year.

Yeah, I'm a newbie, I haven't made a declaration yet, but so far I'm losing, so I believe there's no Capital Gains implication for me at this point. So no reason I can't sell and cap my losses when the price is dropping so quickly.
In my jurisdiction, my understanding is that you need to record gains on every exchange of currency, fiat-to-crypto, and crypto-to-crypto. (I think) crypto-to-crypto will have to be accounted for at the fiat exchange rate at the time you bought the traded crypto.  Which becomes horribly messy when you get a bundle of one coin that was made up of different lots of purchases/trades.  And, again in my jurisdiction, you have to take the 'oldest' coins first.
I thought cointracking.info might do all this for you, but it doesn't.  (See this link which I found the other day, I didn't post here, but they're discussing this problem: 
The closest thing to all this would be forex day trading, I guess. So if I ever get out of the red, I think I'll try and find one of these guys in my tax jurisdiction, and ask them what package they use.
Also, all of the above may be completely incorrect, I know nothing! :-)

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese authorities have ordered Beijing-based cryptocurrency exchanges to stop trading and immediately notify users of their closure, signaling a widening crackdown by authorities on the industry to contain financial risks.
Exchanges were also told to stop allowing new user registrations as of Friday, according to a government notice. The notice was signed by the Beijing city group in charge of overseeing internet finance risks and circulated online. A government source verified it to Reuters.
Platforms should also tell the government by Wednesday Sept. 20 how they will allow users to make withdrawals in a risk-free manner and handle funds to make sure investor interests are protected, according to the notice, which was also reported by state newspaper Securities Times.

(I wonder if all these Chinese exchanges will have enough hard cash to refund everybody..?)
