"Before joining First Meta, Radtke was the Director of Business Development at Xfire – a company that develops IM systems for gamers. Radtke was also the Co-founder, Business Development at Geodelic Systems, Inc."
If your guess is right that this is her:
And this is one of the reasons people have to learn how to fail, and fail hard, in school.  Schools have to teach this.
28 years old and never had a real failure before now.  And then she couldn't handle it.
This wasn't the end of the world until she made it so.

Apple, 1997, just as Jobs was returning.
Granted, it's only a $2.3 billion market cap, but this changes up to &gt;$4 billion in 1998, and was a higher $3.56 billion in Q1 1996 a few months before NeXT was acquired, and inflation has to be taken into account as well.
"What cost $3560000000 in 1996 would cost $5143430156.52 in 2012."

Even if they were paid by a collection agency, it was for pennies on the dollar.  BoA still lost out.

Yes, that's the point.  The commenter I'm responding to wrote: ""find me a 5 billion market cap that has the potential to grow to a trillion market cap or go to zero". The answer is nothing like that has ever existed."
96/97 was the beginning of that era for Apple.

Something similar happened to me and I filed a report with the FTC.  I have no idea if that did anything, but I figured it was worth a shot.

If you don't complain about (sub-)cultures you aren't a hipster of any sort.

"I mentioned "shady" because usually before you reverse your charges you try to contact the merchant to solve the situation, most non-shady merchants try to help you out."
It depends on your purchase and the size/busy-ness of the company.  The local branch of a multi-state-regional appliance retailer once failed to properly install a large appliance my father-in-law bought.  They did nothing to fix this, despite multiple calls, until he reversed charges on the credit card.  They fixed the issue quite fast after that.
