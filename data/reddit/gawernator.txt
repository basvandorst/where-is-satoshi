Didn’t happen
@_date: 2018-01-15 04:25:06
My IRA did more than 8%..... with basically no risk and no work 
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:25:39
It’s kind of dumbfounding. Plus if you only cashed the bad check and did nothing else, wouldn’t you get like a $35 return check fee?
@_date: 2018-01-22 00:50:52
It might not just be prepared 
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:30:44
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:00:01
No. This is why other coins have skyrocketed in value tbh.... bitcoin is not usable as a currency right now 
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:11:32
Of course they would hang up. Every company in the United States is registered for service of process with the state secretary. Do you even have a lawyer? 
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:41:49
I guess I missed that 
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:12:19
Maybe it’s your bank account? I withdrew all my USD funds from Coinbase and it was in my account 1-2 days later. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 09:22:01
They’ll never verify. I’ve been waiting almost two months. GDAX was like 12 hours 
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:56:40
My friends brother just got scammed out of $5,000.  He got a $5k check in the mail.. cashed it and sent some or all of it as BTC to the people? All under the pretense of some sort of acting gig ... I feel most people wouldn’t be stupid enough to fall for that but just a heads up. I think today is when that check will come back declined lol...
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:30:53
Yeah of course, a CS agent is not a lawyer, makes perfect sense to me. Plus, most guys like him will not follow through with any real legal action, it’s just a bluff
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:22:12
That’s because it’s all hype that went mainstream lol..... 
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:19:59
It could stay the same, drop to $1 or go up to $20,000 tomorrow. Nobody knows. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:59:29
He says he has a lawyer but both him and the lawyer are so unskilled/incompetent they couldn’t even google that.... I find it easier to believe he is lying about having a lawyer than a lawyer not being able to use google. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 09:21:47
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:21:48
Yeah and he’s in his early 20’s. I’m shocked tbh.  It’s such an old scam. Checks are an easy way to transfer large sums of money I guess. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:32:26
Why is that sad?
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:58:40
Well your lawyer must be complete garbage if he can’t find out how to mail a letter to a US corporation ������������ maybe hire a real one?
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:07:28
No to XRP, it has large banks already using it as a customer.  That is why the value is skyrocketing now
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:54:12
Around $45 right now? but yeah they're screwed 
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:33:01
Yeah but that won’t happen with bitcoin due to the high fees and extremely long transfer times 
@_date: 2018-01-03 02:42:43
There’s not much they can do to respond to bogus legal threats. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:49:40
Making money is 99% of peoples reason 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:18:45
What’s the best exchange to sell on? I.e. least fees. I originally bought coins on Coinbase but know better now 
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:27:36
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:40:45
If you can lose $5,000 without blinking an eye then you are very wealthy. There’s no way around that
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:59:02
except the volatile price coupled with crippling high fees and extremely slow transaction times means bitcoin isn't usable as a currency at all.
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:14:02
Wtf.... 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:51:15
Lol no it’s a McLaren. The price will go up on it,, a McLaren F1 sells for over a million USD now. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:31:16
24 - Sup 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:17:32
TurboTax is great 
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:26:19
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:11:34
I dunno. I’ve been using GDAX mostly anyways. I like the interface and low to no fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:43:47
Not really. For one, Gold is a real world thing. It’s relatively uncommon, has scientific and industrial uses, and looks amazing. Gold is ornate/beautiful and a unique item. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:55:37
My biggest annoyance is how if you bought on Coinbase it takes like a week or more before you can actually trade with what you bought. Couldn’t sell it move it. Never again. There must be a better way 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:58:02
Gold has intrinsic value though, while BTC is just a fiat. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:44:39
That would be amazing. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:41:11
I used shapeshifter built into CoinSpace wallet to convert my BTC to XRP. Already made a good profit!
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:54:50
Heck yeah.  I converted my BTC and LTC to XRP and more than doubled my money the past couple days!
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:26:50
Software has intellectual property rights laws.  And yeah, if a nuke wiped out all your systems your software is destroyed.  Gold would remain.
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:55:54
It is very possible, because of the real world usage of Ripple.
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:50:10
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:15:10
It’s not because of Christmas. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:55:27
Wat. XRP went up 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:15:16
I won't ding you for lacking the knowledge to answer the question.  :)  I'm sure you'll be able to figure it out soon too
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:42:51
So it’s even more gambling than regular day trading 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:46:21
My transactions have been pending over a week....
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:55:52
Yeah I’m aware. Like I said, I can’t even move or sell it. I have two wallets. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:05:23
How do you convert to USD once it’s in a wallet 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:40:46
Yeah I’ll only be able to buy one airplane instead of two 
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:31:35
Since 2011-2012ish my funds have made me thousands every year
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:29:35
I don’t think so but we’ll see
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:00:50
I’m early 20’s and strongly prefer paper books. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:28:20
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:46:58
Wow.... that’s just.. ow
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:29:00
Yes that's correct.
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:58:23
too funny
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:50:20
what about Kraken and GDAX
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:09:13
The fees are much lower than on Coinbase and GDAX has more functionality.  They are not the same, but owned by the same company.  Like saying Audi is VW.  Are you not able to answer the actual question? "What makes those two better than Kraken? What's wrong with GDAX?"
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:33:33
Reading an e-book makes my eyes hurt, reading a real book is good to go
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:42:13
Her last name is Sarkisian actually
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:55:39
“We investigated ourselves, and found no wrong doing”
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:35:01
It’s supposed to replace SWIFT 
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:19:41
They sold the day before Christmas? No, that’s not why. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:54:20
The government probably has thousands of pics of your face 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:04:26
If you do your taxes right you won’t get a refund or much of one 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:54:53
What makes those two better than Kraken?  What's wrong with GDAX?
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:45:23
So far crypto has been more easily manipulated than banks. Especially BTC with insider trading 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:36:11
Apparently that’s already going on
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:49:50
I just got approved, it took about 5 days including christmas holidays so not bad.
@_date: 2018-08-13 14:31:00
Escaped the asylum I see
@_date: 2018-08-09 09:30:32
Isn’t ironic that an art piece about “burning fiat money” is being used by the owner to generate fiat money .... 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:43:16
What is the actual value of bitcoin though
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:26:57
BTC and/or crypto is almost completely the opposite of a safe haven.  It's an extremely unstable asset with the price driven basically by speculation and gambling.  What??? lol
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:11:20
Except this was a bubble so it’s not typical 
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:55:45
probably like 1-2k I'd guess, if another coin takes over maybe less?
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:34:49
Best to educate
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:32:10
because Steam wants usable currency (USD) not BTC which is super volatile and they would have to pay fees to convert to USD, thus making them lose money.
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:56:47
No that’s now how that works. There’s no intrinsic Value it’s just what the market is currently deciding 
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:38:52
If it was profitable they wouldn't have stopped it
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:34:41
Except engineers don’t do sales .. lol....
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:31:05
I sold my BTC and bought AAPL, coincidentally, lol
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:40:02
Dude is super annoying, a shill with no good product but I’m not sure he’s actually a scammer 
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:07:03
Oh, you mean they’re engineering systems and not working in the sales department. Got it. :) 
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:03:08
It pretty much is pump and dump.
@_date: 2018-02-11 08:50:45
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:45:42
A satire article caused the market to dip?
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:52:24
Pretty much this.
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:30:31
except if the value keeps going down.... then all you did was lose money? lol
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:59:13
Yeah BTC seems unlikely to be the king coin for long
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:53:23
not clear at all
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:59:19
How so?
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:10:54
Yeah. Gold has great physical properties. It also exists in the real world and is scarce. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:44:48
HODL'ers will never own lambos either... they would have to sell to make a profit..
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:45:46
Funny article 
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:32:47
And if you don't have a computer?  Power grid failure?  You have no money?  It won't happen.  One EMP would completely destroy your life.
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:29:23
Fundamental, what?  Bitcoin has the name brand.  That's about it.  As far as the "tech" goes, other coins are vastly superior in actual usage.  e.g. transaction times, fees
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:58:46
But other coins do work a lot better
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:05:52
fast transactions with low fees
@_date: 2018-12-24 00:46:34
Nah.  We had two shutdowns when I was in the Navy and I always got paid.
@_date: 2018-12-30 03:08:34
Hahahaha. Nobody is forcing anyone to use western union’s SERVICES. You think it’s free to run a company? Entitled joke.
