Man what's up with all these recent memes trying to discredit Satoshi?
None of these Szabo or Wei Dai ever solved the actual problem Bitcoin solved for a long time. If they did, we would be using Bitgold or B-money instead of Bitcoin.
Trying to give credit to Szabo or Dai and discredit Satoshi Nakamoto is like saying "The genius company called Kozmo.com came up with the idea to do one hour delivery of items during the dot come era. Companies like Uber didn't do anything original.". 
No. Idiotic companies like Kozmo and all the shit dotcom companies never worked and they are deservedly poster child for the idiocy during that era. Just having an idea and actually coming up with a solution that solves the idea are two completely different things.
Just to be clear, not saying these people are idiots, just saying it's stupid to try to discredit Satoshi Nakamoto who gave us actual working product when all the previous "ideas" have been just ideas.

This guy blatantly says "Future of Crypto" and "Future of Open Blockchain Technology" and you guys support him as "Bitcoin Jesus"?

XRP is the real ECoin, not JPM.

As a human being, that's a lot of assumptions you're making over there. Sure, anyone can say anything is possible. 
And it's easy to say "if integration tests are well done and cover all known use cases", but as a programmer, I know better than to assume that such a thing is easy to achieve.

The problem is a lot of people don't see it as store of value. I think once Bitcoin "survives" to become a stable store of value it will be also used for transaction actively, which is not the case at the moment because of its price volatility.
I think "store of value" comes first, and then transaction. Can't think of it going the other way around. But would love to be corrected.

Interesting theory. I was also curious what the general perception of this 21 company is like in the community.
For some reason they get a lot of media coverage probably because they have VC money, but I haven't seen a single impressive project from them. The latest "pay to email me" scheme is sketchy at best IMO.
I wonder what others think about this company too.
