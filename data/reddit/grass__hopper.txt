Can somebody explain the concept of a Bitcoin ATM to me? Is it like transferring BTC from your 'bank'account to a wallet on your smartphone or does it print a paper wallet after you enter your wallet address and private key or something like that?
Thanks in advance!

Didn't you have to wait at least 20 minutes before the transaction was confirmed? BTC transactions sometimes take over an hour to process, depending on the amound of confirmations required.

I don't really understand how the blockchain works, but isn't the blockchain in danger of becoming very large when people start to do things like this often? (I understood that they will not actually place the books in the blockchain, but suppose they would, or someone else would do something similar)

Agree, no information whatsoever about bitcoin, only a little bit about planet and stars..
