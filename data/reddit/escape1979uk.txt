Its equally as risky (in terms of long term profitability) to own it right now... The same controls you fear could also manifest in a black swan event that renders crypto completely worthless overnight.   
That said, I am exposed to crypto right now. I just have a significantly higher proportion in cash waiting for more buy signals to manifest.

In terms of technicals, I have a couple of custom (paid) indicators that have been good at picking tops and bottoms 
Fundamentally, more alts need to die. 
With a strong capitulation event down past 3k, the scammier projects will get shaken out completely. Binance will delist a LOT of coins, then money will start to flow back in to BTC as a flight to (relative) quality in the crypto space
I'm not an expert though. We might have bottomed already... in which case I'll start to buy once it consolidates and finds support over 6k. 
(Not financial advice in any way. I'm not qualified to give it!)

It makes perfect sense with appropriate risk management
I personally believe it will rally and make new ATHs, many won't share this opinion after a capitulation event sub 3k.

It makes sense. There was a price study done that basically proved that the best time to buy BTC in terms of risk weighted returns was when it had already moved up 20% because the FOMO effect made profits a relatively sure thing.

Buying at 3k and below is a crap shoot as to whether it recovers at all.Personally, I'm a buyer sub 3k.
