Ya I got in at 3753. Oh well. I'm happy I got any piece of any for long term. I actually want it to stay low another 2-3 years so I can buy more before it balloons.

Ta I got Mycellium last week. Originally was going to do a PC wallet likeElectrum, or even an online wallet like blockchain, but after seeing many say an iOS wallet was more secure I elected for Mycellium for my Galaxy.

I just discovered Bitcoin (had seen it in places before but thought nothing of it and had no idea of it's $$$ value or that it was a currency. Just thought it was like a way to transfer money, which I suppose it is.) about 2 weeks ago when I decided to use it to deposit on Bovada. I had to read up on it to discover the proper process of sending it in and started reading other articles on it. Saw how much it had raised and saw it had dropped to $3,000 like 1 week before (was at $3750 at that point) and thought it looked like something worth taking a chance on. Still learning different things about it, but still massively ignorant on it. Only had $2,000 I could afford to spend (and lose) which was quite a bit for me. Prob sound like a moron to a non BTC holder investing in something I don't completely understand, but the charts don't lie. And the more I read on it the more interesting it sounds. Anyways, bought a half a bitcoin at $3750. Plan to buy more on dips even if price of it rises. If it dies oh well. That's why it's called an investment, and not a sure thing.

Wait a minute. I'm new to Bitcoin in general. How do I know I'm in the "right" echo chamber and not the wrong one?

Hah, I have no idea how to do any of that. I just bought my first piece of BTC couple weeks ago and really don't understand a lot of the technical jargon yet. I do own .50 of a BTC though. So I'll just sit back and ride it out. Thanks.

Just made 50% on my whole half a bitcoin in 3 weeks. Sold just now as I feel a correction coming and will come back in with hopefully more (hoping for a whole BTC. Either that or I'll kick myself when it takes off without me!

Must be nice. I just got in like a week ago. I almost have a half a bitcoin, Will keep dropping money in while it is relatively low. Can only do about $500 a month though, and no telling when it will start its true ascension. Oh well. At least I got half a BTC. Better than none at all. Though most people at my job have literally done little more than heard of bitcoin aside from 1 or 2 who kinda know what it is.

I just used both my bank and CC few weeks back. Took 3-5 days by bank $5k limit, but locked in my price I bought in at minus fees (altogether $3750 BTC). CC was instant but only $500 at a time.

Same. Just discovered Bitcoins (for the most part) last week. Can only afford a half a bitcoin currently. Can buy about $500 a month so hoping it stays low for a relatively good amount of time. Initially thought about selling the peaks and buying the dips, but cant take a chance it takes off when Im not watching and never looks back. So Ill just buy the dips. GL.

Oh yeah yeah I got that after reading on the forums here last week. Installed Mycellium and hand wrote words and hid them well.
