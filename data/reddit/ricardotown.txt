You seem to fundamentally misunderstand the relationship between block size and transaction volume.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:21:29
Ethereum already handles more transactions than BTC, cheaper and faster.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:01:49
Larger blocks have solved the problem, and by the time they aren't big enough, it will be just as cheap to make even bigger blocks.
It's possible to kick the can down the road so far that even if all transactions were done via the blockchain, there'd be enough.
LN isn't a matter of just trust, it's a matter of needlessly complex multilayered solutions to a problem that has already been roadmapped with a fix.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:42:55
The base layer has extremely high fees. If it remains unchanged, it's a problem.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:40:04
You can already do this with every other crypto currency not named Bitcoin, and you don't have to go through an intermediary.

More like "I like cars, just not the Model T."

But one of the most important parts of a Lamborghini is the engine. That's why a Lamborghini that doesn't run will be much cheaper and useless.
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:03:18
It's not the volatility. You yourself mentioned the problem. It's the transaction fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:04:20
Who cares? Lots! Typical.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:34:45
Shitty, faster, lower fee fork that does everything BTC does, but better.
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:58:51
Yeah, it's like what if bitcoin operated just like a bank, and did away with all the pesky stuff that motivated the creation of Bitcoin to begin with, like getting away from centralized hubs of currency exchange.
It's great! Now I can pay a large fee to an institution to finally use my money, rather than decentrally, cheaply move it around at will.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:58:09
Why even create a lighting network if we're only trying to store value?
@_date: 2014-10-12 14:15:02
Don't know where to start, don't really have the time to learn.
@_date: 2018-06-01 18:19:40
Why are you being such an asshole?
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:22:05
Hey, you're not wrong.
In the wild west, the only way to prevent things like this from happening is via word of mouth, so I'm doing my part to get the word out.
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:49:05
or you joined via clicking "Sign up" while looking at the bitcoin subreddit, which is why it probably didn't suggest the one you already knew about.
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:11:41
If you click that link, look at the url of the website it takes you to.

There's a difference between taking money from customers who lose a game, and taking a deposited amount and deleting it from the customer's ledger.
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:38:01
I know I have no claim, that's why my only recourse is spreading the word.
I was just enjoying being able to bet on boxing easily.
Now that's ruined :(

They stopped the faucet (which they should've done if they weren't paying out).  But they're still open.
On the transactions page the Faucet is listed as a comp.  I've never heard of a casino that steals your money for using comps.

somebody ban this man!

Wasn't everyone running the full Bitcoin Core node that included the nearly fatal inflation bug that a competing developer alerted everyone to, even though he was called a scammer?
@_date: 2019-01-08 19:16:20
The point is that full nodes all running the exact same software is just as prone (if not more) to catastrophic failure. Decentralize the protocol so people are motivated to run full nodes. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 00:37:29
Yet none of them noticed the near-catastrophic bug, because all the faulty nodes were in consensus.
People aren't manually hashing. People aren't pouring over tx's. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 20:33:36
BCH vs. BSV was a 51% attack in disguise. It was 5 node implementations vs. 1 .
The bug in discussing ng wasn't a double spend bug. It was an inflating n bug that could've been executed unknowably because all nodes we're running the same software and we're in agreement in allowing the negligent code to act. 
With multiple node implementations, the faulty software would've just been forked out of consensus with the rest.
@_date: 2019-01-09 00:17:56
Identical node software = identical eyes in this case. If one misses it, all miss it.

I tried to but the app kept freezing up when I tried to log in to my coinbase acct.
@_date: 2018-04-24 00:21:53
I know of one other user who had about 40 of his 60 mBTC "confiscated" as some sort of random fee during his withdrawal. When trying to withdraw, the site we'd just arbitrarily pick an amt they felt comfortable giving up. They stole the user's 40 even after he jumped through their "you must pay 30 casino games" hoop.
@_date: 2018-04-28 02:51:29
A combination of 0-conf and an assurance of very low fees to be placed on the next block.
@_date: 2018-04-28 05:12:37
It sounds unsafe, but the bit I've read on it makes it seem like it's been nigh impossible (from a physics perspective) to pull off a double spend. Almost like throwing a pebble into a pond and pulling it back out before it causes any ripples.
@_date: 2018-04-28 05:20:35
Safe enough for BitPay to implement it! 
@_date: 2013-03-22 06:02:19
Any idea what the easiest way to convert Bitcoin to USD is? 
@_date: 2013-03-06 05:05:39
Once Brazzers accepts bitcoins.
