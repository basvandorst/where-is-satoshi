I still prefer QR code. If you come to Asia, you see QR code payments everywhere.

QR code is cheap. Print it out and you can start to receive payments. No special device is needed. It's eye catching and easy to understand. Also phones without a camera can still display a QR code and gets scanned. Apple have not yet opened their NFC.

Thailand uses it a lot as far as I know. Singapore, a developed country, also uses it a lot. I live in Singapore.

This is the most interesting story that I have heard about bitcoin. But trading bitcoins can be quit risky. 
@_date: 2015-05-06 05:47:52

Bitfinex.com is OK although the interest rate there is a little low for BTC. I actually have been using Bitfinex for USD investment for about two years. If you trade options, you can also try our options exchange

We should avoid using hot wallet. No matter how well you keep it, you could be hacked.

Come and trade in  We currently have both binary options and vanilla options. 
Our binary options is NOT the UP/DOWN binary options you saw from many sites. You can TRADE it. It has different strike prices, which make no one can price them 100% accurate and thus leave to you profit chance. 
Our vanilla options is the same as stock options but for Bitcoins. You can use it to protect the value of your Bitcoins or make profit.

It's just selling a put option, as a put option can be used as insurance. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 15:04:39
Yes it should be around the current market price. Please send us an email at support if you are interested.

We are doing a short market analysis. Could you remove the questionnaire content? It's designed by us. Thanks.
@_date: 2015-03-01 16:03:55
Nice analysis. Yes, you are right if the seller makes a naked sell. But holding a naked sell position is too risky, I guess the seller should delta hedge the position so that he won't need to worry about the direction of Bitcoin. Given this, only 1) is then required. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 14:49:51
That's right. We just started to attract users.

Guys, I am a Litecoin developer and helped in getting SegWit activated on Litecoin but I don't want to get involved in the fight. But this is really a problem to many businesses. Solve it in whatever way. I just want to see it getting solved!

That one is more general and long term. This is an one time and specific task.

We just released the vanilla options a few days ago. That's why we are looking for market makers. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 09:25:25
Well, if the market supports BCC, we will let users withdraw.
@_date: 2015-03-17 12:45:12
That's right :-)

I am a Computer Science PhD. I developed a few websites before this one. Yeah, we have a few people checked our site. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 10:50:38
I and my partners developed it. Any suggestions or comments?

I believe this is also related to Bitcoin. Litecoin may help with Bitcoin development in the future. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 16:11:48
Yeah, the settlements are done in Bitcoin. We love Bitcoin :-) It makes transactions so much easier.
