Hahaha, looking back. It was the best investment I ever made. Thanks everyone for helping.

Yes I keep hearing that it's going to touch 3800, so maybe wait a week or so?

Here in India, the local money lenders give these interest rates. They make even more by letting it out to others (mostly real estate)

Leading B&amp;F sites think so, also Chinese are known to protect their people's interest.

That sounds good too. Having at least half of it safe in one place and play crypto with the other half.

Indeed. I want to put the money there at least for a few months. Not trade everyday. My second best option is 24% per year interest rate.

The only downside is that I will have to commit the money for atleast 2 years. If I need it before that, I ll get no interest on my money.

I do have something similar to 401(k), I do put some money into it periodically.

Makes sense. Thanks mate :)

Interesting idea. Sounds way more logical thn putting all the money at once. Thanks for this.

Yes indeed. Although I am hopeful that Chinese will allow bitcoin trading eventually with some restrictions.
