Is it against the law to write on dollar bills? 
According to "Money Facts," at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing's website, the "defacement of currency is a violation of Title 18, Section 333 of the United States Code. Under this provision, currency defacement is generally defined as follows: Whoever mutilates, cuts, disfigures, perforates, unites or cements together, or does any other thing to any bank bill, draft, note, or other evidence of debt issued by any national banking association, Federal Reserve Bank, or Federal Reserve System, with intent to render such item(s) unfit to be reissued, shall be fined not more than $100 or imprisoned not more than six months, or both. Defacement of currency in such a way that it is made unfit for circulation comes under the jurisdiction of the United States Secret Service. Their mailing address is: United States Secret Service 950 H Street, NW Washington, DC 20223

The answer is in application of the law.  There are many laws in Russia that can be applied to you if you get out of line... otherwise they are just on the books.  Like the proposed bitcoin laws... they may just get passed and would be used in specific cases as needed.  in drug trade for example, it's pretty rampant there

@_date: 2015-12-30 19:23:04
That's just a theory... I find zero evidence that larger block size leads to centralization.  Larger block size means that a block can be up to some size... Larger blocks lead to larger Blockchain... However, if block size is left as is, the blocks will be consistently fuller and this leads to a rapid increase in Blockchain size anyways... So I should conclude that doing nothing will also lead to centralization as nodes drop off.  Both scenarios then contribute to centralization?  I think not... 
@_date: 2015-06-03 20:33:36
The argument is flawed.  In reality nodes are already going down.  Does it mean centralization or large block size just occurred? Neither...

so, the lesson is, remove your btc from coinbase ASAP!!
reason being, no one in the future will be nice to them and reveal any exploits.  instead they will drain them and coinbase will lose money and have issues with access to capital (i.e. lose enough and you have to downsize, so service will suffer).  or like bitpay, they will be fighting their insurance company for compensation while operations will suffer.
but we all know already, if you leave your btc to someone else, it IS only a matter of time before you lose them

The decrease in nodes is due to the size of the Blockchain... Not block size.  I've had to shutdown several nodes once disk space ran out... I ended up buying a NUC with a large ssd drive and now host one node instead of 4 before.

Idiocy based on personal ideologies... That's the period we're entering in Bitcoin...
We're entering a period where the creator is desperately trying to retain and shape the creation but the creation wants to be free and have its own development path...  The creators will not succeed in holding back what Bitcoin wants to do in a free market.
For mostly libertarian views of much of the current Bitcoin community, there's an aweful lot of hipocracy...

3. theoretically yes if EVERYONE agrees.  thats just not gonna happen for many reasons.  however there would be a fork in reality.  Bitcoin would continue and the altcoin with changed rules would be created.  the most recent example is bcash

good luck buying 406 PH and deploying it quickly.  you will never reach the 51% goal.  you can't do this instantly and thus time is against you.  it's no longer a matter of $$
and you are not considering what happens to price when demand for equipment rises.  so the price tag is wrong too

I never suggested removing the constant.  No need to put words into someone's mouth to try to shape a debate your way.  Some dynamic method makes sense.  But between ALL proposals, there's still no agreements!!! Vote on them instead of beating chests about who's right/wrong and how Bitcoin should be used.  Also, the centralization argument is a farce.  If increases coincide with hardware improvements then I'm just as likely to be able to run a full node 5,10 or 20 yrs from now than I am today with my full node.
But I'm not here to advocate "my way"  let the Bitcoin protocol vote on size increase.

I don't drink coolaid, but I appreciate your concern about my well being! I did live through periods of time and certain places that allow me to see what RT is: gremlin propaganda for the west.
Use west's tools against them.  Germans didn't see what evils nazis/hitler did until they slowly lost their freedoms and were shown concentration camps.  Until those revelations, Germany had popular support in U.S. while naziism was rising... Russia enjoys a similar degree of admiration/support today from many U.S. Citizens.  Particularly because many citizens, rightfully so, are disgusted with all 3 branches here.  However, choosing the lesser evil is still evil and shouldn't be admired/supported.

you might be able to use iSCSI from a host like a Pi running farming software... 
Long term, we'll get manufacturers of storage devices to incorporate farming software into their devices.
For example, unused space could be allocated to storj and as you use up your storage as needed, the amount storj uses is dynamically changed.
This way you don't have underutilized storage at all times.
That's one idea...
We can reduce underutilization of resources in a way

By definition, even a running bitcoin qt/core client that does not accept inbound connections is a full node.
It just happens to keep 8 connections only.
So, what these graphs say is that ALOT of people are shutting down or simply not running their clients anymore.
The presented graphs/data does not distinguish if a "node" is accepting inbound connections beyond 8.
If this theory holds water, we are just going into doldrums for a while as far as btc is concerned.  Price should fall further.  Lots of miners will get out because of the upcoming powerful hardware that many private pools/operations will install like gangbusters, rising the difficulty by leaps we have not yet seen.
However, should btc become available to buy/sell on "traditional" exchanges (schwab, etrade etc...) we'd see more action again.

Competition solves this.
While you spend crazy $$$ to set all that up, a billion independent drives (people) will outpace you.  And people already have drive space on their computers that are underutilized.  It's sunk cost if you will, so to rent it out is a no brainier requiring no more $ expenditures.

The idea that a 2 mb block will lead to more centralization is theory.  Just like saying 2 mb or .5 mb block will lead to more decentralization.  I think network effect governs de/centralization not block size.

I legitimately want to see an analysis of what causes a decrease in the nodes (i.e. Block increase/decrease etc.) with statistical significance (correlation etc.) 
You now think that I'm saying that nodes are not decreasing, you've lost the context of conversation already. You also claim that it's pointless to do so because blah blah blah.  You don't know how but you wish to continue mental masturbation to espouse your achievements, which has nothing to do with the original math fact question.  It's ok to say I believe in it but can't show you the math instead of arguing pointlessly.  When you find correlation to something causing node decrease, please share.

going to 2 mb is easy followed by all the other proposals
so as a result of indecision to implement fast, the miners are taking charge.  that's a solution in itself, sort of a check and balance, separation of powers between different branches?

if core lies that would be the end of it as a single group.  also, then, the  miners would be able to justify their own fork because they were lied to... so core has nothing to gain by not keeping it's promise.

I'm talking about real censorship which did occur and hurt our community.  consensus mechanism are there to decide.  consensus on xt did not happen so it's done.  this is perfect how bitcoin works.  but suppressing real conversation and deleting threads and deleting some wallets is not a way forward.  censorship started here with theymos

It's not right/wrong.  In fact it's an awesome addition... The issue is the order... 2mb first then segwit.  Or segwit and no 2 mb... Thats the ideological battle, not technical.  I personally am concerned that segwit is more complex and potentially could have some yet unknown flaw vs. bumping to 2mb and then having plenty of time to try to break segwit.

Well, well, well.... Unfortunately Bitfury is reaping the rewards of their decision not to sell miners to the public. So george, Bitfury made a strategic mistake, you may still be able to change direction. If you sell enough equipment to the public, you are helping security and DECENTRALIZATION !!!
Fix your mistake and sell equipment to public so that BITMAIN does not have a monopoly.  It's the correct decision long term.  I encourage Bitfury to do it.

There are 8 decimal places after the whole number and the decimal places is what would increase, not 21m...  Each satoshi becomes more valuable and we can got to 16 decimal places for example if .00000001 bitcoins has a large purchasing power.  So the supply is much larger than 21 whole million coins.

@_date: 2016-01-21 21:18:16
the argument that scaling will cause centralization are opinions.  there's not proof of this.  if the blocksize goes up to 2 mb that would not cause nodes to drop.  in my opinion it would increase them because people would recognize that bitcoin will scale and more people will support bitcoin by joining with more nodes.  but either view is pure opinion...

So BitFury and KNC are going to 2 MB.  Hopefully the code is already getting deployed.  Now, we need Bitmain and the rest will fall in.  then Core devs can stop arguing over 2 mb and work on SW.  perfect!

not really an issue. protocol has mechanism to deal with determining what tx get into the next block and which will wait.
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:48:30
my understanding from a while ago is that is was "agreed" to for SW to activate followed by a block size increase via HF (or SF?).  why can't this happen?  is it all really because of immaturity of all involved? seems so because technically there's nothing preventing this. only excuses, opinions and hurt feelings are preventing SW followed by a block-size increase beyond 1 mb.

sending from an address requires the private key to be used... Theoretically it's less secure... And maybe QC vulnerable.  Receiving into one addy is fine, but re-using an address after sending out from it could leave you vulnerable, that's the theory.

I don't think this is smart.  By not selling any to them, they don't get any.  If they get some, they will tell their other fund friends who will go out and buy some and the price will keep increasing to reflect more demand.  If the word is out that funds are buying, there will be a stampede.  If no one sells to them, they will spend the dollars elsewhere.... Also, once they own some, they will act to protect their investment, so they will promote rules/regulation that help themselves and bitcoin.  This wouldn't be a bad thing for Bitcoin.  So, someone, please sell them a little bit to start with!  be strategic about it.

"Either way it doesn't really matter; what you are really interested in is using Greece's suffering as a way to pump your particular brand of cryptocurrency."  stay on topic with me... that's pretty presumptuous of you and shows that you wish to now engage in personal attacks.  EVERY country or nation in our known history that has gone bankrupt HAD the means to hoist themselves out and did.  they may have forgot their lesson decades later and repeated, but it is absolutely possible and this idea of not having means to hoist out is just bologna.  it's fear and uncertainty, that i understand, but the world does not end and recovery can be had.  get rid of central bankers (meaning the nation should take control of it's money and not relinquish it to central bankers).  it's really a matter of values and worldview.  either a person believes in serfdom and is brainwashed into dependency or people believe in personal liberty and independence.  from here stem their actions and what they do personally and via their governments.

he does not have a computer, but now has a smart phone that gives him access to these options is probably closer to reality.  In fact someone making wooden bowls to make a living for their entire life is a craftsman.  He just can't sell to the world, but now he could.  Before this, he would be ripped of by a wholesaler who pays him this low wage for his craft.  that wholesaler then resells that bowl to an american store chain and you buy it for 99.99.

I wonder what you'd say about DARPA back in the day? "What problem does it solve?"  your premise that inventions only should happen to solve a problem is false.  There are many inventions that didn't solve a specific problem at the time but became ubiquitous.  Also your statement that you don't have a problem with your centralized US dollar is lacking in understanding.  You are being robbed by inflation.  the dollar has lost over 90% of it's purchasing power.  your standard of living has decreased as compared to 10-15-20 yrs ago.
@_date: 2016-09-02 22:44:17
Why would you write an article that will equate bitcoin to fringe uses?  The dollar is really good for fringe activities, better than Bitcoin for illicit activities.  Instead, why don't you write about mainstream uses of Bitcoin and its potential for the worlds unbanked.  Articles that try to marginalize Bitcoin are so 2 yrs ago at this point, we've been through a hundred Bitcoin wakes and funerals already... Start embracing the change!
P.S. Those Feds who got caught stealing while investigation Ross U. Would have never gotten caught if they stole cash.  If they stole bitcoins and got caught due to the nature of technology, how much have they stolen in non-Bitcoin, government issued money before?  Do you think they were angels before Bitcoin?

Your cost can't be linear.  Every additional miner will keep increasing after some point and the cost will run away. If it's all done from 1 entity/buyer.

I was thinking about this very long term.  So, while it's really pointless to create models beyond 5 yrs, my question was, could they make 1 billion (today's $) in fees per year in 10 yrs from now if Bitcoin and whatever other relevant cryptos become everyday rails for transacting worldwide?  If you believe that Bitcoin will take over, maybe there's a greater than 50% chance this is a yes. (or absolute zero if it all crumbles).  I made my assumptions based on this question.  Also, if this is true, the profits are recurring? It's all conjecture and assumptions on my part, but that's how I've thought about it so far...

The are so many useful applications of Factom technology for the medical industry!!  On the one hand, it can help create a unified database, if you will, WITHOUT centralization.  Meaning that for the longest time, people have tried to centralize medical info and naturally, for very good reasons (which I personally support) this isn't a good idea from a technical stand point as well as ethical/moral reasons.  However with Factom and blockchain technology, we can achieve that outcome but the medical information won't be centralized and thus won't be vulnerable to hacks/abuse ala credit card hacking we see every month.  Once your medical data is exposed, it can't be put back in the bottle, if I may use that metaphor.  (If your identity or credit info is compromised, after painful 6 months, you can restore and fix it, but you can't put back an exposure of some medical condition you may have, it's out...)  Also it will give the consumer/patient control and security of access to their medical info.  Patients can control with their doctors who gets access to their info as needed in the continuum of care on a granular level.  These are just a few of some high level ideas for the consumer facet of our healthcare system.  On the other hand, solutions for fraud in claims and waste in processing infrastructure are geared towards the payer/provider facet.  For example we can secure a claim to show that services that are being billed did occur and the insurance company does not need to ask for nurses notes, super bill etc... to audit a claim.  Many insurance companies do this, including Medicare and Medicaids.  This is very inefficient and it costs billions.  Then, there's the whole facet of collections (agency or not) and reimbursement and determining benefits and eligibility prior to medical services being performed (being able to prove that a payer said a member is eligible for XYZ and they can't say no we didn't).  Explanation of benefits comes to mind, secondary claim processing, discharge protocols, follow up care and adherence to disease management protocols etc... We can also replace e-signatures with Factom utilizing solution where the signing of consent forms as well as others can be proven to have occurred in a specific context (verbiage, version etc...)

Agreed, but with a two party system we haven't been able to get other candidates on ballots.  Also, during primaries, the turnout is even worse, so better candidates don't have a chance.  However, with this said, if turnout was good then this issue can be overcome.  Unfortunately there's a mindset about this that has set in and the political parties like it that way...

There are scientific papers out there, just search...
I think, however, you will just argue that they're not "scientific enough"... My original comment stands.  We are discovering ways to communicate/transmit faster than light.  However, folks assume that this is attempted in the same medium that IS governed by the speed of light limitation... I see that we will simply use something else that doesn't violate known physics.  we will use different means that are not governed by the speed of light and therefore don't violate it.

"Useless" claim.  I don't know a better word that's not so abrasive to use honestly...

false premise on your part.  you are confusing "against the tax" with views and opinion on taxation.  The so called "bitcoin supporters who are against the idea of tax" simply do not exist.  you are not saying what you really mean to say.  namely, these supporters  don't like how their current tax dollars are spent now in the first place.  they are FORCED to accept spending they do not support: wars, unconstitutional behavior, unsustainable welfare etc... etc...  you think that they are anti-tax, but they are not.  they have no problems paying taxes for services necessary to the society: roads, licensing, law enforcement etc... but not for evil bullshit all western governments are involved in.  get it?  bitcoin provides some hope that in the not too distant future, taxation can change thus spending too.

A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy, always followed by a dictatorship. The average age of the world's greatest civilizations has been 200 years. "Attributed to ALEXANDER FRASER TYTLER, LORD WOODHOUSELEE. Unverified."

I'd be interested in getting involved on such a project.  It's the next step in decentralization of the world.
We also need this same/similar concept for communications (voice, phone, email etc...) we don't need google, AT&amp;T, iPhone to communicate and to do it in a secured, private, decentralized and de-identified manner. Snowden and NSA have opened a Pandora's box.
The one question that's been bugging me for a while is: can any of these future services/products leverage bitcoin transactions (hashing for ex.) to: further secure btc, provide incentive to run such a service, to leverage it for encryption. ?
