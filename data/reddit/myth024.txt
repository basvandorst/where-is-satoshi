Must be nice, all these idiots who are allowed to get credit cards, go on spending sprees, and never pay it back!! As someone born disabled, expected to exist on LESS THAN $8K PER YEAR, I wasn't lucky enough to be allowed to have any credit cards. If I were, I might have had the chance to get myself the shitty used van I desperately need to SAVE MY LIFE!! Instead, I get to sit in a toxic HUD apt, unable to keep my bare bones survival needs paid for, and watched my grandma &amp; my mom both get multiple cards they just went out &amp; spent until they were maxxed, then declared bankruptcy.

The thing being figured out is whether "Bitcoin" is a protocol or a software. The difference is that protocols (http, ftp, voipo etc) are not intended to be changed but to be stable so that things can be built upon them,. Software, on the other hand, is expected to be improved regularly through new versions being issued.
