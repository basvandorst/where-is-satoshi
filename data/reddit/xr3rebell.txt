that's my plan. this is how I've been doing it since yesterday.... ca. 22% more BTC in the portfolio - well, the hard way is behind me already; -)

Have just sold all BTC at 14.950... It's going down...!

Cool, didn't know that the study was in English, I changed the link. Thank you!

Even a bank can make mistakes... ;-)

Exactly, such "official" opinions are more likely to be believed.   
It's good news for the system around Bitcoin.  
**Keep it up...!**

That's true, but the name Bitcoin is being spread more widely and is thus gaining more acceptance among people.

Children and drunks are telling the truth!

Nein, wenn du mir das hier auf reddit bestätigst reicht mir das. Ist ja auch irgendwie seriöser als so ein Aktenzeichen... Schönen Feierabend und frohe Ostern!

When I just saw a Dimitri video, I thought I'd make one myself. So cheer up! Better times are coming again for Bitcoin &amp; Co and the Blockchain. Stick with it and tell everyone about the good sides of the blockchain technologie!

hm, there's trouble from the woman when you buy Cryptos but when it comes to the divorce, then they all want to get your BTC... ;-)
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:04:10
Yeah, other people, but I'm saying the bottom is now reached. My word counts more! ;-) lol

Who has sold the last few weeks, can be happy now. The HODL is valid for the current phase! I think the bottom is reached... Clearly, Altcoins are getting stronger, the portfolio shouldn't be 100% BTC.
