How in the hell could the price go from 16k - 19.5k in a matter of minutes, GDAX completely crash, and I log back on the price is 16k again? How much money must be pumped into BTC for it to jump 3k in minutes?
Seems like a clever plan on SOMEONE's part... Would my limit sell orders even trigger if I posted them at 19k or would they just be overwritten by it's bad server base?
Im starting not to trust GDAX more..

We are two regular guys who are really into cryptocurrency and music and decided to combine the two for a fun project. We would love to do more of this, and even make a more well-produced video for this track. We are accepting donations of BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC, and NEO to fund our future musical endeavors - addresses in the youtube link. 
If this has inspired you, share it.. we hope to use this track to get more attention to crypto, and also provide some funny moments for those of you who are deep in the space already.

One of my favorites. Gotta love Reddington.
