Can I pay with bitcoin?

You can disappear on Mexico though.

So you're saying he was probably a weeaboo?

The games aren't open source... I don't think

For what reason would anyone use newsgroups instead of regular forums for anything besides Warez? You're getting met with a lot of skepticism but I really want to believe you.

Well you're mostly right. I used to visit family and where they lived wasn't bad but a person could definitely live a new life.

Yeah. Especially since Kroger owns Dillon's, Food4Less, Fry's Marketplace,
QVC, Smith's, King Sooper's, Harris Teeter, Fred Meyer, Baker's, Ralphs, 
Owen's, and Fred Meyer Jewelers.

"Wait what!? Why!?" was my reaction to Windows only hosting.

I think he means that when his initial sell earns back $250 PLUS enough to cover the loss of the rest.

I have scripts that do various things network-wide on a dd-wrt router. I'm too lazy to find which one is blocking certain websites.

Wait... I'm think I understand now... its Bitcoin AKA Bitcoin but NOT Bitcoin AND(!) it's pronounced bitcoin? 
@_date: 2013-08-06 23:44:54
I can't go on bitcointalk because of my settings on my router. Can I pm you here?

If I have an address and privkey that I generated myself, can I start sending coins to the address without entering it into a client as a way to save my coins?

He looks like Jack Black.

There are people who had to lose the money you gained. For those who lost what they didn't have in the first place, they're SOL. Yeah, it's their fault but damn... that must hurt.

Generate the passwords and use them until you have them memorized. Lastpass is what I use to generate LONG and SECURE passwords.

I've been trying to get verified for a while now. I don't know the answers to these questions and they're supposedly wrong.
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:58:53
So what are you going to do with your moolah?
@_date: 2013-11-15 04:25:18
I bought a verizon gift card but couldn't use it because it didn't give me a pin. I'll have to contact Gyft tomorrow. 
@_date: 2013-06-23 00:49:24
I've thought of buying a shitton of bitcoins and funding a trip through England by selling them to locals.

Donated $100 to Charity: water. Sent proof in PM.
I have to say that I LOVE your idea.
@_date: 2013-08-16 02:04:43
This would be awesome... if I could actually get verified...
@_date: 2013-08-07 05:11:11
I can only afford two $3.33 meals per day. :-(
