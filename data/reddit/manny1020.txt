I understand that small business owners will still end up on this subreddit to ask questions even after doing some research, I've seen various posts by business owners (including the ones you've linked to) asking for more information about accepting bitcoins, and most if not all responses are correct responses, suggesting they go through coinbase or bitpay. OP made it seem like business owners are landing on this subreddit and disregarding bitcoin as a possible payment method because of what they read. Not saying it isn't possible, but if that is the case, then I still think they should not be using bitcoin if they are going to make that decision based on a subset of the bitcoin community, especially on a site like reddit. Not saying I don't want this subreddit to be more mature and taken more seriously, but it's not rational to expect any major overhauls to take place.

Not if they are using bitpay. Bitcoin funds are automatically converted to fiat at the time of purchase, so it is basically like accepting cash when they accept Bitcoin. If they are not using bitpay, they must know it is a risky thing to do and they are risking those funds to volatility.

As previously stated, the government doesn't have the resources to go after what would be commonly defined as a small player (buys a few tabs of acid on silkroad, a gram of weed, etc.). Even if they wanted to, they couldn't. Sure they could go after a few small players, but why?

It's funny because there is like, this cool thing you can use on the internet, that like, is kind of like a library or something, that when you want to know more about a topic, you can use it and tell it what you want to know more about, and it does this cool thing where it brings back articles and stuff about that topic you wanted to know more about, and if you read them, you can kind of understand that topic better, because you know more about it from reading those articles. Like, for example, if there was a difficult concept I wanted to grasp, I can look it up using this cool internet library program, and then it becomes less difficult to grasp. I'm bad at explaining things but these newbies should check it out!

I prefer you talk about the security issues around bitcoin and forget about the altcoins. There is nothing inherently different in any of the altcoins that is worth comparing them as alternatives to bitcoin at this point in time. Many people though, are still iffy about the security of bitcoins, and it would be a service to the overall public understanding about bitcoin if there was a segment about how one can go about securing their bitcoin the right way, using one of the newer password protection methods, namely bip0038. A lot of the general public still thinks their bitcoins can get "hacked", since those stories of people losing their coins tend to be sensationalized, and they need to know there are ways to protect your bitcoins so they are basically 100% secure. 
Basically... people hardly understand bitcoin, let's not drag a bunch of altcoins into the mix. Let's go a bit deeper into bitcoin, namely security, and how to go about securing your bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 20:36:20
Yeah, I just don't see the point of wagering .0001 at a time, especially with the lag on the site. I think it would also bring in additional revenues since users will have an option to increase their wager, and if they are on a hot streak, they might really consider this  / want this.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:23:10
Duh, that's like opening a business and having your main slogan be "we accept credit cards! And only credit cards!" 
Start a business that you'd be good at, and is profitable. Don't start one just cause you'd be the first business to accept bitcoins for that service.

Are you stupid?  Milkywaymasta knew someone else would steal it and just end up using it without offering to return it, so he took it in his possession to make sure it could be properly returned to an address that had not been exposed. He suggested a segment on the security of bit coin as a semi joke since it is obviously needed, but is still offering to return the funds regardless. Sure, he took the coins (only $20 worth btw...) , but it was based on good intentions and not to buy a present for himself. What would you prefer, for them to be stolen by some random person not part of the community and for them to be spent, or what Milkywaymasta did?

Talking to someone about difficult concepts would be great! When people know at least a little about a concept after learning a little about it (who knows, maybe from this library type internet program???) and can discuss the concept to learn more about it, it is always a good idea!

Really, you think business owners are going on this subreddit and making decisions about the payment methods they accept for their business based on what they read here, instead of doing some basic research? If so, then I'm glad if they decide not to use bitcoin.

It's not that I disagree with you, but what do you expect from this sub? There are plenty of bitcoin news sites that do not have the idiotic commentary you'll find here, and just strictly news. You know you don't HAVE to "sieve through all this shit", right? Just go to coindesk.com if you want strictly news. Remember this is a general bitcoin subreddit, and with general subs you will always find the demographic prefers quick memes and not in-depth discussions about news articles. Don't think this is going to change anytime soon, even with your "PSA".

No I deleted the multibit backups because I wanted only a wallet on a usb drive and a truecrypt encrypted one. usb one got deleted by my dumbass brother and my truecrypt one got corrupt some how.
I already wrote the bitcoins off. I bought them at $65 so it didn't cost me much, but figured I'd ask to see if I had options. The only option I have is the wierd .wallet I recovered that was only 1kb. But this is too small right? I checked with a hex editor and it only has a few hex characters which looks like they correspond to the file location. Not sure though.
What about sending the flash drive to a pro? It has hardly been used but I did run recovery software on it and found nothing. I've been using my laptop alot since I've deleted the files so I doubt they can be recovered from here, but maybe the flash drive?
@_date: 2013-12-25 15:17:41
I'm not good at calculating odds, but I think the odds are against this realistically happening with the game ACTUALLY being provably fair.
Technically the odds are 50% lose, and I got 93% lose.
The odds of that happening, I think, are low, in and of itself.
(Like getting heads once and the rest tails...yeah it could definitely happen, but very rarely)
Then I note that I won my very first scratch off, then lost 12 in a row. No odds needed there, just seems very weird, like getting 1 heads, and then 12 straight tails.
Someone else though, who also has odds of 50% lose, also got a 93% lose rate. Not a big deals it seems, but the fact that they also won their 1st scratch off and lost 10 in a row makes the odds seem shady and not actually provably fair.
Again, no math here, to me it just seems like common sense that SOMETHING is off, but if someone who can actually quickly do the math can chime in with some stats that would be awesome.

Isn't bitcoin a threat to the system?  Wouldn't the next logical step a government would take against a threat is to ban it?  Doesn't this confirm that bitcoin is big enough to cause concern to governmental institutions? I think this is a part of the process, and it is good because it is showing that bitcoin is progressing. The fundamentals around how bitcoin works have not changed, only governmental policies surrounding it. Did you gain more faith in the value of fiat currency because of this news?

Encrypted wallet with true crypt. Tried to access it about a month after. Entered correct password, opened file with multibit, get an invalid wallet message, contact Jim from multibit, let's me know that the hex code is probably repeating digits meaning it's corrupt beyond recovery, I check with hex editor and it is indeed repeating digits. Contact Dave to recover, also cannot help after looking at wallet. I sent the 1kb wallet I recovered to Dave but he never responded back.

Coinbase Fee = 1% + 15 cents
Transaction Fee = can be setup to be less than 1 cent
Using a $50 payment:
Total = about 1.4%
Usually merchants are charged both per transaction and monthly to process credit cards, and I'm not sure what the lowest charges are, but taking the Paypal Payments Standard plan:
3.5%   (using $50 payment, at their rates of 2.9% plus 30 cents per transaction)
We're at a 2% savings for bitcoin purchases, though I am sure I am missing something somewhere, likely from the paypal rates, as the bitcoin rates are pretty solid, I don't think I'm missing anything there unless your doing something weird.
You're crazy if you think using a credit/debit card costs you nothing. The merchants are passing off those expenses to you.
No such thing as a free lunch.
