Stick with something more predictable like the regular markets. As recommended below, invest that hard-earned money in an IRA or something. Bitcoin seems very appealing with insane returns so far, but it is wholly, absolutely wholly unpredictable, more so than the regular U.S. stock markets. 
Edit: Betterment is a cool site to start with.

Chicago Mercantile Exchange company, they're bringing Bitcoin futures to the futures market for the first time ever. A somewhat equivalent of BTC being traded in the NASDAQ if that were possible. That means real-world investors from around the globe looking at how to invest, or bet against, BTC.

@_date: 2017-12-11 03:30:44
Yes, look for yourself. Shot up $1k in a matter of minutes after CBOE started showing it at even 17k. CBOE supposedly just halted now so we're leveling off for a bit. 
It's more than just the Bitcoin futures, it's literally all connected in weird ways that make no sense. That is the nature of the markets. We're all just hoping BTC can rise above the rest of Wall Street and exceed expectations as revolutionary investment form / currency / whatever it will be 10 years from now. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:23:47

At your age losing $100 might seem devastating but if you can make a quick triple or double profit off of it in the next year you'll be glad you did. If it crashes, oh well, maybe getting a steady job in tech will treat you better moneywise in the end lol.

@_date: 2017-12-08 23:06:12
You have to go into the advanced section of the sell order stop and specify a number lower or slightly higher than your limit trigger to create a small gap. Example: $11,000 limit, advanced limit $11,050. That is it'll fill anything inbetween $11,000 - $11,050. If you *don't* define that, the price could drop from $12,000 straight *past* the desired $11k price to say $9,000, and then you'd get stuck selling it off at $9k instead. Even if it rebounds from $9k back up to your desired price, doesn't matter if there was only a single limit trigger set. That's why defining a range is VERY helpful in sell situations.

@_date: 2017-12-07 19:31:49
Well if you do the math, $11k to $15900 is about $43 profit off of a $100 investment. Obviously not a whole lot, and when the dip comes, can disappear pretty quickly. That's why a ton of people "hodling" on here are in it for the long run and have been since $300 per coin in 2013, $1k per coin, so on. 
I got in with a few more hundred bucks back in June at $4k per bitcoin...so I'm not going anywhere selling just yet lmao. I think the Bitcoin concept is brilliant and if it can get refined and picked up 5 years from now in the big leagues, it's going to change everything on the Internet and in the economy. 
Edit: Also keep in mind alt coins are a lot of fun, and way cheaper too. IOTA was a highly talked about coin that was sitting at $0.87 in June, and now recently shot up to $5.00 roughly. Speculating cheap coins with promise is mildly addictive.

It really is hilarious when skeptics come on here to tout how useless Bitcoin is. Exactly as other people above have said, electricity, credit cards, cellphones, automobiles, etc were all radical new concepts of travel, finance, and communication that were scrutinized as being useless. Not to say an idea doesn't have its limited lifespan, like the telegraph, but it in all likelihood takes hold or evolves into something else that *does* go somewhere. 
Bitcoin is going to go somewhere, whether or not its called by the same name 30 years from now.

Lots of red flags in your comments, this one showing how inept you really are. Buying low is one of the most desired actions. Even if BTC plummets to $5k, like any other stock that ever existed, there's time to get out when it starts falling. The opportunity to buy again at correction is music to our ears.

Futures are literally outside investors betting on an asset *30 days into the future*. So currently, CBEO is predicting BTC will be $18k in a month or so. 
This is why the futures were going to be a pretty big deal, regardless of what some ppl on here said. The regular stock market like the NASDAQ / Dow Jones all pivot on enormous news speculation, dropping at a whim of some CEO being ousted or vice versa. Welcome to the jungle lmao.
Edit: Regular futures you could bet on at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are lots of crops too like beans, corn, wheat, since those prices fluctuate by price per bushel granted what the weather does, etc.
