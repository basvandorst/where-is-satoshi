I'd argue, before it was a service you gave that to for savings. NOW it's just another thing you give your most private financial information to as an 'Investment Intermediary'.
Shame on me, they have mine. Not for today's service, but for yesterday's. Sadly, I can't take that back.

I'm confused by this.

When Gmail offered their service, they never pivoted. Gmail has always provided email.

These are the important questions.

Good for you. 
I'm not specifically talking about an experience. I'm talking how they are presenting their pay model. Why do they have to list off customer support as a 'premium feature'?
Why don't they just have customer support as a feature you don't have to pay for?

Yes, basically it's another [robocoin]( but worse, at least robocoin [rebranded]( Lawnmower just changed their platform and kept their branding as well as all the prays. In review of their ranking of 4.2 stars (today) out of 5, since announcement and new branding they don't have very many people complimenting their product like it once was. Their customers since their announcement (of pivoting) basically stand with my opinion, but they are bringing in new naive people off the old ranking.
It's an injustice, because they used to do something else (which was great) and that something else is what they were (and still) ranked on. This new service is just a shill and copy of others success. 
Bitcoin to change was a game changer, but they couldn't hold out and pivoted.

The fact that the pay for platform offers ['premium support']( I take that as a spit in the face for those whom don't pay for it.
I'm a long user of lawnmower as well, I just liked their old product.

This post is not fear, uncertainty or doubt. It's a general complaint that their model was 'changed' title sums it up. They went from a savings app/company into an investment one. 
I just wish they rebranded and am making a post stating so.
