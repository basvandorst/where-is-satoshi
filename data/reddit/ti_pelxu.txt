So the new coins are represented as a new *n* value, which are then not spent in the old transaction because that transaction only specified certain *n*?
And then to spend the new coins that were sent to that address, you increment *n* to the new value?

Sweet. I am glad that you have accepted them.


**Damn!** That's a fair amount! What was the rate when you sold them?

In Australia. That is why I am considering them. I am also considering *Coinjar*. I  like to keep my options open. :)

Fair enough.

Really? That's great. I have made a few transactions with CoinJar, so maybe I'm ready to take some money to igot. Especially with BPay, that makes things much easier, and faster I think. Thanks! This is great news!

**Thankyou!**. That seems worrying, I will keep watching. One of the things I liked about *IGot* was that I didn't need ID for a quick transaction. LOL, I guess. I hate it that people try to scam, and if this isn't a scam, I hate that they do a bad job of making a good rep.

Also, Australia needs **more** exchanges. So I want to help support this one, if it is legitimate, so that it has the chance to become more popular.

Why is that a bad thing? It isn't a trading site. Its an exchange/wallet.

Cool, Thanks!

Okay, so I've been *thinking* about this the wrong way. Thankyou and (love your name by the way). I think I get it now. The entire **output** is used up, as the new input. New coins sent to the address are in entirely different transactions, with entirely unrelated outputs. These are then used when the owner of the address decides to spend again.
