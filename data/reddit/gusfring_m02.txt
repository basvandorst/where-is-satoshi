Wow i dont know why your parents would take away stuff you bought. Anyway i wouldnt worry about my crypto taken away because my parents barely know how to work the internet let alone crypto.

I am asking if it is a sign of a bullrun in the near future (possible early next year). Turn that frown upside down :)

Thank you. Most of my friends are duggies or drug dealers thinking theyre like pablo escobar. Not lile im any better than them but atleast i only do legal things to make money.

I dont know whether my bank acc is linked with theirs or not (probably is) and they are getting more suspicious by the day. Bad thing is that they suspect me of being a druggie than investing in cryptocurrencies so maybe when i explain to them what I do theyll understand. Thanks for the advice!

My parents have a very strong opinion of drugs (both used molly when they were kids, trying to keep me away from drugs in general) and would hammer my face in if they ever found out i was using which im not. But all the money thats flowing in and out my bank account is soon going to be suspicious. And i cant have my entire life savings in crypto when it goes down (up and down up and down, i withdraw my money when its up and put in money when its down. So many transactions in a month to a year, it really gets my parents suspicious).

I have thought about it, using tether or dai and any other stable coins. But i would much rather be safe than a chance to throw my life savings down the drain. Ive thought about dai more than tether, thanks for reminding me!

Thanks. Maybe ill go to a jeweller and ask about gold bars and coins.

Haha i would agree with you but I'm live in a very bad part of dublin almost where all the people me and my parents know have openly admitted to using drugs (adults and kids) and arent sorry about it saying it is harmless. Also some people are small time robbers and burglars. These are the kind of people im mixed up with so its a simple 2 + 2 for my parents.

Theyre not techy people like i said. As far as theyre concerned, im throwing around money on the web and possibly risking it in scams. If not finding out about my cryptocurrency, theyll probably think I deal/use drugs.

My mouth is zipped from ear to ear but i dont know what will happen if they decide to confront me. Even if i steer away from telling them i invest to crypto (which i do) and dealing, doing hard drugs (which im not), theyre gonna do something rash like cut my job away or freeze my account (nowhere to withdraw my crypto until im 18).

Thank you. I'd happily go to college and study something thatll get me a well paying career. Maybe not as far as waterford or galway haha. UCD is looking pretty good though.

I checked irelands cgt rules and my gains are under the limit for taxation. As long as my gains are under, i dont have to pay any tax.

Do you think that maybe stock fundamentals wouldnt apply to cryptocurrency since it moves 15x faster and highly volatile?
@_date: 2018-11-06 18:03:14
Dont know whether thats a joke or being serious but thanks for the advice
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:14:27
Best guess is that for the next 2 weeks it will start to go down for around 10-20% until the cheapskate whales finally start buying in and start a bullrun around dec-jan. Anyone else agree?

All investing is essentially investing with data and you your gut to back up your decisions. Just so happens cryptocurrency yields hogh profots with high risk. If i were to go into stocks, i'd get 10 or 15 euro back from a 200 euro investment in a year (IF IM LUCKY! Why i lile cryptocurrency so much is that it is volatile meaning higher gians at high risk. I started in 2016 with 200 euro and now have around 6k (down from 9k because of dec 2017). I could never get money like that in stocks or bonds unless i have a large principal (starting money to invest) to begin with. Plan to move into stocks and bonds when i have large ebough savings.
