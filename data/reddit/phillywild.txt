I just stay away from the "Special Offers", they even have a disclaimer on the top of the page when you click on it. I don't mind spending about a half hour getting to the 100 uBTC requirement for a payout.

The Kings ownership group isn't a publicly traded company. If the owners want to accept bitcoin and hold on to it, it would be their decision.
Maybe one of the investors in the group could possibly be forward thinking enough to swap some of the bitcoin for a percentage of their share in the group.
We're talking about millionaires and billionaires here anyways. They can afford the risk should they choose to do so.

if you have a coinbase account, it's linked to your email address. so once you sign up and confirm your address to the OP, you'll get a email from coinbase that its in your wallet. For me took less than 15 minutes in total.

I'm thinking he's saying that as the value of the protocol itself, rather than an arbitrary number of individual BTC/mBTC/uBTC.
Bitcoin is unique in that its a currency and a payment/financial transfer system that uses said currency.

I'll just say one thing. Capital Gains taxes only apply if you realize a sale on a financial instrument (property, stock, bitcoin) for profit, and since he's owned these Bitcoins for over a year, IIRC he only has to pay the respective income tax on it. So I would say for OP to cash out what he needs immediately (rent, this and next months bills), then look into tax brackets and see how much he can take out this year (combined with the rest of his income from his employer), without moving up to the next tax bracket.

Same as having holding in stock market. Whenever you cash out the asset you report the income or write off the loss. But if your buying and selling using the asset itself (BTC), that's where it gets murky.
I haven't looked it up, but for example if I exchanged all of my USD for GBP, what would be the tax implications (as a US citizen) of that?

Which makes bitcoin a more efficient way of doing it, compared to cash purchases.

This is what I love most about the concept of P2P, there's no "central authority" making these decisions. There's no marketing department or PR budget and adverts. Every member of the BTC community can take their own initiative to spread the word. That's a great idea, kleer!

That's an obvious concern, also the fact that its customary in the industry to NOT request tips. So that's what has me a bit hamstrung. Being a concierge, I have a bit of freedom when it comes to how management treats us. We're seen as the main component to what makes a good hotel, a great hotel. And guest satisfaction is our speciality. I'm allowed to advertise myself. But its the question as to how I can incorporate bitcoin into doing so. A lot of travelers these days are very tech savvy, even the older generation.

Could have easily been that she bought some bitcoin at $15 or so. Sold when it moved up higher. Then used 70-80% of the profits when it declined to buy back in. And now she has enough to go to school in the spring semester and cover the costs and her expenses for a few years. It's not COMPLETELY out of the question. Conceptually, leaving a dead-end job at Walmart to go to school and get a degree would count as "life-changing".

Oh I agree wholeheartedly with that. I make it a point to NOT do that, its very unprofessional.


That's the biggest hurdle I'm trying to overcome. Right now I'm all prepared to accept bitcoin but no way to let people know without it coming across as pandering for a tip. One way I can think of is for when I get asked "do you accept tips" I can respond with "bitcoin or cash?" BOOM! Icebreaker. Then its in their mind and even if they still use cash, they can look it up later when they're like "Wtf is he talking about, bitcoin?" But individual business cards seems like the way to go. Then they can contact me on it in the future and tip me instantly from wherever they are, in the hotel, from their home, when they're on their vacation and/or business exploits.

Market cap gain is more of a measure of percentages than it is an actual amount. If Litecoin goes from $10 to $20 that's still a 100% gain which is substantial.

As bitcoin transitions from a tool to store wealth to more of an economic engine tool, it will continue to increase the value.
You have to be able to spend them so they can be worth more. Irony.

Then I would say that the only tax issues would be if you realized an income through selling your bitcoin, then the paper trail would be through your bank (unless you did it strictly P2P using a service such as localbitcoins.com) There isn't a tax on net worth here in the states that I'm aware of. The exchanges and companies such as Coinbase would obviously. But in regards to the IRS and the average Joe, bitcoin is still a product.
