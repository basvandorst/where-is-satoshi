I think its just a coincidence. If you look at the google graph. The first peak/bump is in 2011 (may) ,whereas the price bump of bitcoin is  March 2013

Obviously I am looking for a site that accepts bitcoins. Primedice does not offer automatic gambling. Also tried dicenow, but it seemed a scam. Play for a small amount(0.01BTC), but lost it all in 15 losing streaks(simultaneously), and that do in the first try~

:) Nope, I don't think anyone would take that deal. After all, we spend money on a lot of stores on campus. And since bitcoins are accepted in those stores and can also be used to purchase things online, it has a value of 100$ for everyone .

Its hard to know the exact number. But most of my friends did claim it.

I am an undergrad at MIT. Yes, we did receive the bitcoins last week. For people wanting to know why it took so much time, it was probably because of the process involved in verifying MIT students, and making sure the student is a current student on campus. There is a lot of verification required before they can give away 100$ to the students.
And those wondering about the introduction of bitcoin at MIT. A lot of students here are aware of bitcoins. I got into it, for playing poker as pokerstars shutdown here and it offers great technology. Students are very well aware of it, but some just don't care much about it. It has been brought up in classes as well, and after a discussion only some people follow up on it. 
I also know of a few people who are working on developing some great applications with it including some alums(LibertyX).  If you guys have any questions I would be happy to help.
I have also asked around about what other students plan to do with their 100$ worth of bitcoins. Responses have ranged from just holding it for now, testing services, and playing poker :) and some just spent it on supplies at Kendall Coop and on campus stores which accept bitcoins.

Certainly does, but we can't possibly have 100's of such keurigs :)
There are definitely students in ME very well capable to build such projects, but the interest in less as compared to EE .

What can we expect of the prices, as BTC is accepted?

What do you think have been the greatest innovations on the blockchain? And what can the future innovations bring up ?

Just to add to this. I posted a reply in the other thread as well. A lot of people know about bitcoin,but are simply not interested.
For a Mechanical engineering student, building a software might not be a desirable option, and they would be willing to sell it.

Merry Christmas! Thanks for doing this :)

Are questions which deviate from bitcoins to altcoins welcome?
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:59:10
Its mostly freshman. But most of the students are over 18. 
@_date: 2014-11-11 22:16:11
Some people aren't just interested, but most students definitely cared about it. Also, students below 18 had to get their parents approval and sign to apply for it, and that probably steered some students away.

You can gamble being in the US as well..Just Use Bitcoins!

I am actually visiting India next year for an internship for 2-3 months. And would love to try and get some people to try and use bitcoins there. 
What do you guys think would be a good idea to pitch bitcoins to them and get them to use it ?
I don't mind starting up a company with someone there, as I have an indian friend with me who is also interested in the bitcoin technology. I am thinking of something easy like the sms thing, which wouldn't require much technical know how, and would allow people with a normal phone to send and receive bitcoins as well. Ideas?
@_date: 2015-01-10 00:58:08
They gave us BTC worth 100$
@_date: 2015-01-10 10:21:35
Well , I am still holding it as its the only way I can play poker here in the US. I did buy from couple of my friends too for 80% of the market price when the price had started dropping recently.
@_date: 2015-01-09 23:29:07
Thats awesome. Great to hear you got it all back !
@_date: 2015-01-10 10:22:34
@_date: 2015-01-10 00:02:33
I am still holding on to mine. And Its almost 1 BTC now. ;)

I am part of the bitcoin club on campus. I was involved with bitcoin before it was distributed on campus as it was the only way to play poker on US soil. I am currently in Course 6 (EECS here) . 
Ofcourse I see it having a large potential in the industry but that would happen only after a larger adoption and use by people. I don't see it overtaking fiat to become the primary currency, but its definitely a better way to send and receive money than using paypal and credit cards.

Haha, I remember that post. Did that guy visit the subreddit to leave an update on this ?
