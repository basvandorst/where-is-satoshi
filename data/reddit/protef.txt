This is a great explanation of the way i which payments are made. Simple, yet straightforward. However, I think you could improve the explanation by adding in visuals for explanation. Also, the site looks sleek and clean. Keep it up!

I'm right there with you OP. I've tried explaining bitcoin to my fellow peers and people I happen to meet with the simplest of terms, and even those who seem interested about the subject still don't grasp it.
To illustrate, I was talking to a mortgage broker lately who replied that she had thought bitcoin "was dead". When I told her it was very much alive and doing well, she proceeded to pull out her phone and show me a Reuters News article with the headline "Bitcoin CEO Found Dead" and asked me for my opinion. I told her bluntly it was a terrible article. She then dismissed that notion, and instead stated flatly "But it's Reuters!", blindly putting her faith in a mainstream media brand.
Another fellow I was talking to just recently was asking me about bitcoin and why it is better than traditional currency. He then asked me how he could buy some and I explained the various methods. He focused in on the exchange brokerage option, but couldn't get past the fact he'd have to pay $5 for a bank transfer onto the exchange to purchase bitcoin. "So you're saying I need to pay to buy bitcoin?" I tried explaining to him that there were completely free options such as buying it in person, and that $5 is not a big deal seeing as the price fluctuates quite alot (while we were drinking an $8 pint of beer). He simply couldn't get passed this idea and dismissed the entire concept.
If there are redditors in the Toronto area who are interested in getting together and discussing this amazing technology. Please send me a PM and lets have a meeting of the minds.
