Please go to the nearest 7-Eleven and pick me up a melon soda. Try to pay with a credit card, let me know how that works out for you.
If you actually lived there, you would know that you  must have cash on you because more places don't accept credit card than places that do. You can't buy a train ticket without cash. 
Suica is more widely accepted than cash, and you can pay cash even for online purchases like amazon.jp or Rakuten by using a system where you pay cash at the nearest convenient store.  
Fucking pachinko balls are more accepted than credit card. So please, quit your bullshit you fucking tourist.  Literally the only thing less accepted than credit cards are buttcoins. But seriously, even Monopoly money is more widely accepted than butts, so that goes without saying.

Even if it was universally accepted, getting them is still a problem. I would either have to convert from a currently accepted currency, or sell something for bitcoins. 
They are great if you are a business and you can accept them as payment, but for your average guy or gal, you'll probably stick to whatever currency your employer  is paying you in unless you're buying weed or something.

Probably the same way they oppress the use of Chucky Cheese tokens.

Why just the other day I was at the gas pump and paid for gas with bitcoin. It was easy, i just swiped my card...
Wait...no, no i didn't. 
I misremembered. I swiped my visa - because you can't yet pay for gas with this currency. My bad.

Japan is a cash only society. it's not uncommon for people to walk around with their last paycheck in their wallet. That being said, outside of very large stores, you're not going to see anything accepted but cash.
