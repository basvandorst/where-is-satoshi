Yes you pick the period.  Then your ema is based on x number of those periods.
In OPs pic we see EMAs of 10 and 21 periods and the period is 1 hr so they are 10hr and 21hr EMAs.
Click 4h and those EMA would change to 40hr and 84hr EMAs but only averaging the prices seen every four hour interval

Oh I was wrong, completely completely wrong.
with SMA(x) ... x is the number of *periods.* I was stuck thinking x was in *days* no matter what. 
So with SMA(21) :
if period is daily, it's the average of the last 21 daily closes.
if period is hourly it's is the average of last 21 1hr closes.
if your period is 6hr, it averages 21 6hr closes.
and the smaller the period, the more recent the dataset, hence the closer proximity to price.

Names based on the fractions won't do much to help with the psychology problem. But if .01 BTC had a name that made that fraction feel *not fractional* but like *the "base" unit,* then we'd be getting somewhere. 
I know people will balk at this, but I thought at least interesting to think about...
What if .01 btc was a bitcoin DOLLAR. (or bitdollar... BTD?)
The word dollar has a lot of psychological weight as "basic," and its used by 11 countries, its not just a US thing.
So right now (roughly) 1 BTD = 1 USD
All the wallets, exchanges, and merchants, switch to denominating in BTD. Next thing you know, those of us holding a few coins have a few hundred bit dollars, and to those wanting to buy, the market seems accessible. Last price on mt gox is $1.09 :)
But perhaps more forward thinking to call .001 bitcoin a BTD. Then, wow, bit dollars are a real bargain at 10 cents. A "Bitcoin" becomes like a gold bar. Symbolic but not really what we're passing around.
Fractions sound like fractions. And the slangy names (mickey) just sound like slang; they have their place but not in trying to affect the psychology of adoption.

Even tho it's advised not to use coinbase as a wallet, lot of people do. It would be great if they'd let users subdivide their holdings into checking and saving, or spending and growth or whatever u wanted to call them. It would only be an interface thing since with coinbase your coins can be floating around who knows where. But that simple UI thing would really help people get their heads around spending.

thanks, yes this is what I figured. 
I would think its not uncommon people would jump on blockchain.info to watch their transactions... then see something like this and have a wtf moment. would be nice if coinbase site let you see these "internal" transfers on your home page... or even if there was a note on the transaction itself on blockchain that said 'coinbase internal' or something so you knew it was kosher?
