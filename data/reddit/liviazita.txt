Thank you! :) For international shipping, it depends on where to. Average regular international shipping for 1 pair of earrings is between 7-10 dollars. :)
As for the earrings themselves, I usually price them based on how long it takes for me to make them. One wouldn't want to work for 3 dollars per hour at a regular job :)
So based on that (and the cost of materials), the 11th Doctor earrings go for 23 dollars, but if someone pays me in Bitcoins, I always give a discount which brings them down to 20.
I can certainly make custom Portal earrings! I have done a pair for a friend, but I don't have any photos. It resembles this image: [Portal Example](
Of course, the clay is not see-through like that :)
Alternatively, I can work from custom sketches as well :)

I make clay jewelry (earrings) that I sell for Bitcoin :3 The last piece I sold was the 11th Doctor from Doctor Who:

I also make them custom :)

Does this mean anything for Bitcoin yet?
Also, where credit is due (cause I'm not an ass): [OP here](
Read the comments in that thread, if curious about a discussion on the article.
In my opinion, quantum computers are still a relatively long time off, but one step at a time. There are much more obstacles to overcome, but they're tackling them.

Forgot to write that a pair of Portal earrings similar to the one I've linked (but made of polymer clay) would go for about 15 dollars a pair.
The 11th Doctor took forever to make and is a very finicky job, hence the higher cost.

Great call! On the first day I created my wallet, I got bitcoin tipped on Reddit! I was SO impressed that I went through my favorite saved posts and content, and tipped the one I liked the most with the amount I just received :3
Spread the good! :))
