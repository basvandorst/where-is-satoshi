When you hold your own private keys then bitcoin is secure. When you transfer to a handler then you need to trust them (just like a bank or a money manager).

Sorry. I was being a bit facetious to your serious question. A more reasonable answer would be to diversify. Gold, USD, blue chip stocks that pay dividends, bonds, real estate, BTC, LTC.

Sorry to disappoint but the USD is backed by, at least in part, government debt. This means that actual humans (taxpayers) have to do actual work to pay it back. This fact helps maintain its value by a significant amount.
BTC is based on a lot less (useful for quick, cheap, anonymous transactions). It is backed by nothing whatsoever.

Real estate.

Has anyone ever estimated how many kW of power are required to maintain the blockchain?

No. It. Doesn't.

Shutting down bitcoin would violate yout right to freedom of speech. Transmitting the information in a blockchain and in any cryptocurrency transactions is communication. This is a type of speech and is protected in many country's constituions. They will no doubt try, but it would fail a court challenge.

I think this is how the current tax rules work: A taxable event has to occur before you should have to pay your taxes. The first type of event is if you sell bitcoins for a fiat currency. Then you would likely be taxed on a capital gain and at the applicable rate. This would be similar to selling a stock in a company or a valuable painting.
 
The second would be if you were paid for a job in bitcoin. Then you would pay tax on the amount that bitcoin would be worth in your country's fiat on the day you got paid.
There should be no need for new tax rules for bitcoin.
