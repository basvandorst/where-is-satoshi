Regular installments.  Spend $X amount every month/week/day.  There was a site for this, but I have lost the URL.
Definitely spread them around.  If you are holding them for a while (it seems you are), go cold storage.  Transfer everything out of the MtGox account into a wallet (where you hold the .dat), then put that .dat in a safe, offline place (flash drive, CD/DVD).  I would make multiple copies on multiple devices just in case one fails.  Then, securely delete the .dat from your computer.
Also, [Paper Wallet](  Might want to give that whole section of the wiki a read.

I've been out of the world a bit and as a result, have no idea what is going on.  If I'm reading right, robobot01 and CDanielOL were in a bidding war for  one bitcoin.  They are also bidding in bitcoins, so it's like I have a dollar and I want to see what I can get for my dollar.  Robobot91 offers me half a penny, but then CDanielOL offers me 6/10ths of a penny.  And so it continues until CDanielOL offers one dollar for my dollar.  Sensible people should stop there, but robobot91 offers a dollar and 5 cents for my dollar.
So either:
CDanielOL and robobot91 are idiots
CDanielOL and robobot91 used an autobid but didn't set a cap (or the cap was too high) (bear in mind I am not familiar with this site)
BidOnBitcoins manipulated or fabricated their bids in order to finalize their evil plans.  This seems to be the one you are leaning towards.
On another note, who the hell has a business idea where they bid on currency **in the same currency**?  I could slightly understand it if it were varying currencies, but this is just stupid.

I'm pretty sure you are having some problems with your firewall.  I ran into similar connection issues when first starting, especially with stand alone mining programs that won't automatically add exceptions.
What OS are you running?  If it is Vista/7, keep reading.
Start -&gt; Type "firewall".  Hit "Windows Firewall with Advanced Security.
Hit "Inbound Rules" and then hit "New Rule".
Hit Next ("Program" should be selected by default) and then hit browse, navigate to the mining program.
Continue hitting next and follow all the on screen directions.  The defaults will be fine.
Repeat for "Outbound Rules".

To figure that out, you would need to crawl through all the addresses [here]( notably the 8 that recieved 2600BTC each (well, only 7 did, the eighth only got 347.66BTC :(
If you mean through this single IRC log, just check each unique bitcoin address.  From the first and last few addresses that were posted, they each got 1 BTC each.

Yup, that's the one, thanks.

Oh, wouldn't that have been fun. The linked address was the original, the eight secondary addresses were the first wave in scattering the loot.

Makes sense, they don't want anyone exploiting it.  [Fordy]( says more info on the vuln is in GitHub, but I haven't been too involved (don't know who's who).
EDIT: And I hate GitHub.

Thanks for the heads up, though they were very non-descriptive about the actual nature of the vuln.
I guess it was this:

It is going to depend on the individual setups.  You might want to use a [proxy]( (all miners connect to your server) to make coordination easier.
As far as mining software choices go, I like phoenix.  It has a very large amount of tweakability.
Unless these servers have high powered graphics cards (not something traditionally used as a selling point), they will just have server level CPUs, which might have a rather poor hashrate.
@_date: 2013-03-13 05:43:15
I am strongly considering getting the $149 one once some banking details confirm (~$35 short, rest is in mined BTC).  Even with the huge increase in network power, it should break even in a non-unrealistic time frame (with BTC being at $45 and free energy).
But as arzos said, don't expect to get it soon.  I'm hoping for it to get here the last half of summer.

If you have free electricity (or rather, there will be no difference in the amount you or someone else pays to the electricity company whether you mine or not), then it is profitable.
As for mining LTC, it does offer a better return on time invested (as of pre-crash prices and difficulties).  I'll edit after I check the numbers, though I expect it to hold true.
Overall, is it really worth leaving your computer to run 24 hours a day at full capacity for 13 cents?
Per month BTC: 0.04 @ 22.2 Mh/s, difficulty 8974296.01489  
Per month LTC: 1.65 @ 22.2 Kh/s, difficulty 404.82011437  
//LTC hashrates are BTC hashrates/1000, or replace the Mh/s with Kh/s
At €105/BTC, you get €4.20 mining BTC per month  
At 0.03246 BTC/LTC, you get 0.0536 BTC per month = €5.62 per month  
Yes, mining LTC, trading for BTC will get you more BTC than directly mining BTC.
But with such a low hashrate, it isn't all that worth it.

Trying to send very small amounts will result in a sizable (in comparison) fee.  This is to prevent against flooding the network with very small transactions.

It isn't really a big deal (all TOR exit nodes are publicly known), but its kinda like saying that the the coffee shop stole all of your money when it was really only the place the thieves used to scout the bank you own.
They are just an innocent third party whose generosity was exploited to hide the identity of criminals (that sounds really harsh, but that's pretty much what happened).  Its not horrible to post, but no good would come of it and all the information we needed was that it was a TOR exit node.
@_date: 2013-05-01 04:23:03
No, and it would likely be detrimental to the economy.
Bitcoin mining does not utilize the entire card, most notable when it comes to memory.
Doing so would cause spikes in network performance, wrecking difficulty calculations.  Imagine 1000s of 7990s coming online, then suddenly vanishing.
The bottom line is that these companies are huge and do not need alternate revenue streams, especially in virtual currency.  How would they report it on their taxes?  It would take too much initial and continuous time and money investment to bother.

 (Sidebar)


Sell bitcoins on Mt.Gox, transfer money out of that account to intermediary (Dwolla), international wire transfer (check with your bank before doing this, Mt.Gox is based in Japan), or LocalBitCoins (in guide linked above)


You can use coinbase, I like using the bitcoin-qt client (the one you download and run on your comp, con you have to download the entire blockchain).  There are a few others that have their benefits, but I cannot speak to them.  You could keep all of the funds in Mt.Gox (it is easy to transfer BTC out of Mt.Gox instead of USD), but if you loose your account, it gets compromised, hacked, Mt.Gox goes down, etc. you will lose your coin.
EDIT: Expect to give many of these companies A LOT of personal data, including but not limited to Full Name, DOB, Address (with proof), banking details (routing and account numbers), social security number, photo ID...
This is to comply with Know Your Customer laws.

I do not pretend to be an expert.  My answers are based on my past experiences and should wait for more responses before passing judgement.


As far as I know, no.  I'm sure that they are aware of it and someone up there thoroughly knows how it works, but it has not become a big enough threat to actively pursue.


They wouldn't shut it down because they have no control. It is an international currency not entirely based in the US.  They could try to regulate or ban it (US IP blacklist for bitcoin related services), but bitcoin is spread P2P and that would be very difficult to ban.  They could try to attack Silk Road (drug trade done in bitcoin) and call it part of the war on drugs (and by extension, attack bitcoin if they deem bitcoin = drug trade more than money = drug trade).


Bitcoin is instead regulated by limits in the code.  There can only be a certain number of bitcoins in existence, so no deflation from printing more money.


Mainly the people using it.  Transactions that have been confirmed 6 times makes it mathematically very challenging to reverse.  Bitcoins themselves are unique and non-copyable (you can't suddenly say "I have 100 bitcoin, trade it to Address XYZ" as the network (made up of individual people) would look at the entire transaction history of Bitcoin and say, "you never got 100 bitcoins, that isn't a valid transaction".  Value is determined by what the people using it value it at, see my next answer.


If you are referring to the recent events: a block was larger than what Bitcoin v0.7 would accept, but Bitcoin v0.8 would.  The blockchain (contains all transactions) forked, creating two separate ledgers.  This caused panic and dropped the price, which then rebounded rather quickly.
If you mean fluctuations in price in general, treat it like any currency.  If people believe in the country of Bitcoinia, Bitcoinia's currency (bitcoin) will raise in price.  If Bitcoinia suffered government overthrow/natural disaster/financial computer system crash, people might not see Bitcoinia as reliable and value its currency less.


I cannot answer this because I do not have any idea.  Those who have great faith in Bitcoin will be able to answer that better.


As there is no main body regulating this currency, planning like that isn't the easiest.  It needs much more time to be heavily adopted, but it would help if it did get listed on currency exchanges (answered at the end).


The short answer, for the money.  Because of the slight instability of price, you can play the market to your advantage and make profit.
Long answer, for the idea.  Because it is decentralized, no one group can control it.  It is (psudo)anonymous, transactions verify within hours, transactions cannot be disputed after a few confirmations, transactions cannot be reversed without a very large amount of processing power.  There are more reasons, but better said by a more involved person.


Someone emailed Bloomberg, and they said if someone sends them the numbers, they would post it.  However, bitcoin is still too unknown for companies to make the effort to reach out to the community.
I hope that answers some things, let me know if you have followup questions or you want something clarified.
I had doubts early on (it got on my radar when Rick Falkvinge did a post on it, very early into its creation). If I had stuck with it, I would be ridiculously rich if I cashed out at the $30 peak or now ($45-50 peak).

It is odd that your NMC and BTC balances are not updating at the same time, unless the block did not reward the pool with BTC but there was a NMC reward.  I am not familiar with your pool, but I would not expect real time changes.  3 hours seems reasonable for balances to update.  I would not worry.
@_date: 2013-03-13 18:37:28
Things should lag a bit when you mine (like you said, GPU is being used for other things).
In additional parameters, enter:
      -v -w128 -f10
And see if you get a performance boost.  You can also overclock your card if you want more performance, with the cons being more heat and shorter card lifetime.
@_date: 2013-05-02 01:20:50
Hopefully we can just say "that'll be twenty-three eighty four" and the customer will now that they owe 23.84 mBTC.
But when it comes to public adoption, we need to give them an official name (millibit, dollar) and let them come up with their own representation (mib, buck).  It isn't something that we (as comparatively early adopters) can decide for the masses.
Millibit is fine for now, and even "mic" won't be used over "microbitcoin" as we are still very much in the stages of new users, who are going to have a hard enough time understanding millibit and microbit to begin with.

The [sidebar site]( recommends [Canadian Bitcoins]( though they seem like they are falling behind trying to fill orders.  They support Interac ($5 charge) and Check/Lettermail(Free).
To get money directly to Mt.Gox, you would need to wire funds there.  I don't know how to do this, but inquire with your bank the related fees and timeframe.
There is also [localbitcoins]( to coordinate meeting people IRL to sell/buy BTC.

That is all the time, 24/7, provided you can get 400 Mh/s out of it (speed your card can "mine" at).  You might get more, you might get less.  I'm running at a significantly slower rate (210 Mh/s), but I don't pay for energy.
One thing to keep in mind- ASIC's are starting to be released.  These are computers whose sole function is to mine bitcoins.  As so, they are much better- they give more performance for less money and less energy use.  I am going to get a $149 USD one that will run at 4.5 Gh/s, though I don't expect it to get here until 3Q 2013.  Once a majority of the ASIC miners come online, GPU mining will be much less efficient.

Another revenue stream that would generate additional profits that they could post, yes.  Perfect example was the creation of tri-core processors which were just quad core processors that had a damaged core.
Bitcoins and computer hardware are two completely different things (wheras tri and quad core processors are not).  A company isn't going to take the time to start creating a completely different product that will interfere with the product they are already making.
If these companies could replace their burn in programs with a program that did the exact same thing, with the added bonus of automatically depositing a substantial amount of money into an account they control in a currency that the could actually use, by all means that should and they will do it, and probably give a raise to the guy who suggested it.
Bitcoin mining is not that.
@_date: 2013-05-02 00:49:05
What is wrong with millibit?  The fact that it rolls off the tongue makes it perfect and conveys much more information than "mib". Also, I don't think that people would hear millibit and think that we are talking about a million of anything.  If we wanted to talk about a million bitcoins, we would not abbreviate it as a million bitcoins would not be a standard bitcoin measurement.
Millibit conveys amount very well due to the metrix prefix milli- and -bit lets us know we are talking about bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-01 04:25:42
Leave it to the bots, they do it much better.  For the hell of it, I decided if I could use the pretty consistently lower BTC-e price with the MTGox price (this was pre crash, where it was much lower than the $1 it is now).  It was a bitch, though I think that all the services I used had an API.
@_date: 2013-05-01 00:19:30
It is confusing what you are asking.  It seems that even though you are connected and submitting shares to your BTC mining pool, your balance still reads zero.
Have you been mining for a considerable amount of time (enough for several complete blocks to be mined)?  Is there a "pending payment" or "unverified shares" count?  Is there a "verified shares" count that is not equal to zero?

Bitcoin is a decentralized electronic currency.  It is not controlled by any group or person, transactions are pseduo-anonymous (all transactions are public, but addresses do not contain the identity of the person behind it. 
[This]( will help you understand the bitcoin process.
Using your 7870 to mine bitcoin should get you about .05 BTC/day.  As of right now 1 BTC = 48.63 USD = 31.36 GBP.  You should factor in your local energy costs to see if mining is profitable.
You should join a mining pool.  I'm a fan of [Slush's pool]( but compare and see [which one suits you best]( (payout types and fees).
Download [GUIMiner]( and just let it run.  If you want a bit more control, use [Phoenix](

It probably isn't worth it.  Ignoring pool fees, you mine 5/24ths of the day, bringing your daily average hash rate to 10MH/s (48MH/s * 5h/24h).
Per  @ 10MH/s
it will take 0.01/0.0005 = 20 days mining 5 hours a day at 48 MH/s to get 0.01 BTC, worth $1.41 USD, assuming you have "free" electricity.

Daily withdrawal limit is still 100,000 EUR, with separate 100,000 EUR transfer limit (US account).
