No, many banks understand how crypto works. AML laws are quite stringent (as they should be, imo) and have unintended consequences such as this. Legislation needs to make clear that using coinbase and such does not automatically imply money laundering, and then the banks will back off. Til then, this will get worse.

As someone who works in the AML industry: this has been in the works for quite awhile, and it or something similar is absolutely going to pass. Nothing is going to torpedo misguided regulations like this - there's too much money involved for concerned parties.

Which, again, are currently having a negligible effect on the global economy. It will come in time. Right now it's smaller than miniscule.

What does it add to the economy? I'm not talking in terms of its inherent philosophical value as an alternative to fiat money - what *value* does it add to economic activity? 
Note that I am 100% a believer in cryptocurrencies. I'm just not sure what you mean here. Because thus far it's served as a method to further capital accumulation, from my point of view.

Those are its (very positive!) philosophical values. I'm asking for the value it is adding to measurable economic activity at this point in time. Again, not trying to knock it at all. I think we're getting a bit ahead of ourselves when we talk about the impact of bitcoin on economic activity at this stage, though.

Sometimes there is a very thin difference between "mental" and "genius".

A commodity that has also lost a lot of its face value over the last few months?
