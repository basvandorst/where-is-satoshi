How about an imprint of a bitaddress on a credit card or debit card, so you have 2 ways of paying, less is more. You can go to a place and be like "do you guys accept Bitcoin?" "No? Okay I can still do Debit/Credit"
Just wipe the words on the back of the card off and leave a spot for the bitaddress.

No, I spent $40, and they took out all my money, then charged me $2500 in overdraft and interest.
EDIT: Also I must add that I paid my rent of $800 after they took the money out, and never told me that they took the money out, and so as the last time I checked my account I had the money I needed to pay for my rent and gas. But the bank overdrafted me $800, then $35 for every $100 over, and then because I didn't pay it in 1 week, I had $1,000 in interest. Then by the time we went to court the fees added up to $2500.
@_date: 2015-05-13 19:01:59
I filled up my buddies gas tank and had the receipt and everything, and the bank said "You have never bought gas before, so we took out the money due to fraudulent activity."
I even sent them the receipt and everything, and they said that it isn't there problem.
And no I don't have the ruling because it was 10 years ago.

This one did, the judge told me, "You can not blame the bank for taking out your finances and you not knowing about it, I know what is in my bank account because I check it everyday."
I tried to tell the judge that, that would be impossible for me as at the time I didn't have TV, Internet, or phone for my apartment and having no car would mean I would have to walk/ride the bus 5 miles just to get to the bank just to check my account everyday. And the judge said, there are no excuses for ignorance. And said, "I hear this case ruling in the way of the plaintiff (Bank of America), you have shown me no evidence that it is not your fault as the defendant. The defendant is hereby ordered to pay $2,500 to the plaintiff as decided by a mediator in ways of payment plans. Court dismissed."

I got frauded by the bank, they took out money from my account because they thought fraudulent activity was happening, there was literally nothing happening on my account, so they took out the money so it wouldn't be taken by the person committing fraud.
Long story short, I paid my rent, and the bank never told me about the removing my money from my account. So I paid my rent and got an overdraft of $800, then my bank still never told me anything, then never put the funds back into my account and refused to when I finally found out. And then says "It isn't our responsibility to let you know about the fraudulent activity on your account."
So I took them to court, and the courts overruled my case, and now I owe Bank of America $2,500 for no reason.

@_date: 2015-05-28 20:19:20
They ask for donations for non-college level education, and fake lessons. None of these lessons will actually help you in gaining education or credits in order to get a degree.
It is like going to a tutor and doing 2 years worth of work and then trying to get into college and be like, "oh I already did all the work, can I get a degree now?"
"Oh but I donated to this place so I could continue classes that were college level education!"
"You paid some random person online who said that you were getting a college level education that wasn't accredited?"
"Yeah, I don't see the problem here, where is my degree?"
Khan Academy is a group of people who get paid (by no means is this "free") You get an introduction for free, and then like any dealer you have to pay to continue.

Seems a bit gimmicky, not trying to put it down or anything, just my opinion. But it seems to leave a trail, like a digital signature and so on can be erased, and can be accessible by the owner from anywhere in the world, but this... it isn't versatile. It's like sending letters in the mail, that is a thing of the past because we now have email. In order to see it you have to be there, but for the digital age it is easier for you to be able to access the information from anywhere in the world.
I get that people would want this, because it is better than keeping a piece of paper with your password on it that could get damaged... but it seems cumbersome, it seems heavy too... how about a credit card sized sheet of metal, that has the password embossed?

You should be banned for 24 hours for feeding beggars. 
One of the rules is: Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy.
Which means that you shouldn't donate to them either.

 is that they never have any restaurants or food places on their site.

Grubhub needs to focus on finding actual restaurants... I live in the middle of Riverside, CA and even when I go to LA... it gives me 3 options for food. And none of them deliver and Grubhub tells you they do, and when you order you never get your food.
I ordered $35 in food on Grubhub for a local place, and after waiting an hour I called up Grubhub and they said to call up the restaurant. I did, and they said "Yeah we don't deliver, we have had your food ready for over 45min when are you picking it up?"
So I called up Grubhub and they said we don't deliver the restaurant is supposed to. And they wouldn't refund me the order. So I left my friends house while drunk and walked 2 miles just to get the food and come back. Fuck Grubhub.

And my reply was


Which is a direct response to your post. You pondered about how people don't have $5k, and consider those who have $5k to be rich. So I told you a fact about how even $700 of disposable income, not even $5k is extremely hard to come by for the average American.

I wish I had some kind of skill, I am think about whoring my body out on jobs4bitcoins, and just do stupid stunts like doing challenges like Sprite and Banana challenge and what not. I already did the ghost pepper challenge for no money.

In today's world you have to do job application and searches online, there is no reason to go out and look for a job anymore since they just tell you to do it online.

EDIT: actually now that I think of it, it might just be a ticket that she purchased online. But still if they can scan QR codes video the watch you should be able to do the same with your bitaddress.

I don't get your point, at which point did I mention bitcoin?

Those are all practical laws, and I back them 100%

I currently have $40.31 in my bank account, and have no job since I was laid off, and went to Truck Driving School, only to re-aggravate an old work injury and had DOT disqualify me, this is how easily someone can not have $700 of disposable income. I used to work and make $1,000 a week, and now am living on a couch of my former foster father who lives in a 1 bedroom apartment with his boyfriend.

This is just a scam from CEVO, no one is ever going to win because there is no money.

Checked your history too, seems like you are just using an account used to validate new possible scam accounts by using your 3 year status as proof, but I can say as someone with more clout than you, that this is fishy as fuck.
It is a forum entry that ANYONE could post especially a scammer, and then it is an extension that collects your log in information and cookies so that it can use it as it feels fit.


This is the response to feedback to people who want to cashout. He is buying more time so that you use it more and give him more information. Also the feedback that you ask us to check out... there is 2 feedback posts, BOTH of which are questions of why it doesn't work. But you know, I am scum of the community and what not.
How about this, you show me a video of this working, and then take it to some kind of IT department and tell me if it has or hasn't collected any of your information or some how scammed you, so do this and get back to me.

Did you make sure to tell your aunt that she shouldn't waste her money like that? No one buys anything on iTunes it is literally just a library for your stolen illegally downloaded content for your media devices.

I have like 2 submissions, so ratios are better than quantity.

Rich people investing in things that are making money, color me shocked

What does that even mean?

I just joined the Coinbit community about 3-4 days ago. So I have no clue about anything that used to happen.

All you have to do is have a witness sign a notarized letter stating that you did this with information from the advertising entity, and then when you don't receive your funds, you take them to court and you instantly win.

I didn't really think that would be a rule. But then again I haven't even been apart of the bitcoin world for 24 hours yet.

Thanks for the helpful links, I have been working on accumulating bits all day, I have about 4.5k bits, not a little over $1 in bitcoins. This really reminds me of Swagbucks lol. Any helpful tips on how to accumulate them faster for someone who is broke as a joke?
