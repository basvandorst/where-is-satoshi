I was looking at just September this year, and the price was &lt;600 $ per BTC. Indeed, very volatile. There was a time when I bought BTC at 300 $ just to try it... now I wish I bought more. 
I guess nobody knows if/when BTC will go down?

makes sense

Why do you say "for this amount" ? When wouldn't I want to compare prices?

I plan on using a passphrase for the hardware wallet. I am more concerned with the paper variant as if somebody has access to it, you're done. Is there a way to encrypt the paper (well, whatever you print on it at least :) ) ?

Yes, in my mind I basically burn the 10k, they no longer exist. I just want to be able to buy as much BTCs as I can with 10k. It would be depressing if tomorrow thye are worth 50% less than the value I buy in today.


I was reading somewhere here that this doesn't actually work not only for bitcoin, but even for dollars or other assets. I don't remember the technical name, but there were users saying that this isn't smart. Has the opinion changed?

Well, you *will* need to get your money back from your paper wallet, right? When doing so, it will require software. So isn't that at least "as safe" as hardware wallets?

Can't I just print and encrypt the hardware password the same way I can with a paper wallet? Wouldn't that allow me have the best of both worlds?
