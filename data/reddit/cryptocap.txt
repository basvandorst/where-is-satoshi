That is not a convincing way to put it, but yeah, one might ask, out of all billions of people on earth, why do this specific enourmous group of strangers have the right to vote about your body and income. Direct democracy or representative democracy, some of us just want to peacefully be left alone.

For a brief moment I thought you had attached the neon sign to the lambo. The horror.

Swedish tax agency shows what happens when you get too much freedom:  
Never mind that this was an ad from a tax agency.

We got to work harder to disconnect Bitcoin from liberty!

But what would [Sam Seder think](
@_date: 2014-06-01 06:52:21
Yeah, he is the kind of Internet hero who thinks privacy from government is damn important, except for when it comes to economic privacy. Then the allmighty governmenyt suddenly must spy the heck out of you to make sure you are a good boy paying your taxes.

That will do it!

Happy to see that you updated your website, it looks more trustworthy now. You blogging about development and how far things have come is very much appreciated.

How about a more professional looking ad, now that Bitcoin is getting pretty serious?
@_date: 2014-05-17 07:45:55
I am curious to know what these people think of Bitcoin. I bet they think innovation is all good and privacy is very important, but privacy from government snooping around in people's private finances? Don't they regard taxevaders as immoral citizens who should be caged by the state?

Funny thing is, some stranger gave me the equal amount. He sent me this mail explaining that I had been randomly chosen in a donation.

Ah, black and yellow.

All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace is great if you are into liberty and want to watch some particularly ridiculous bullshit.

In a world of Bitcoin and free markets, the "artist" would just spray a similair message about the unfairness of the economy and need of an authority ran by "the people".

What if individuals were to volutarily form associations with like-minded to live in the kind of society they prefered.

Are Apple not to decide themselves what apps should be available on their own App Store? Their users voluntarily agreed to use Apple's product and let Apple decide what apps should be allowed.

A decentralized market is a lot harder to stop and there might be other reasons for governments to take down a market besides drugs. It could be used for selling tax-free goods payed in cryptocurrency, for instance.
@_date: 2014-04-22 16:36:54
And here we were just about to separate Bitcoin from these dangerous free market extremists. Damn you, innovation and spontaneous order!

Why do you need to close the door when you visit your bathroom? Why be so exclusive?

I know one of the guys behind Mullvad and find him very trustworthy. They appear to be knowledgeable and value privacy and liberty highly on a personal level.

Silk Road sellers compete through good service and products rather than gang violence.

People like Matt claim to be anti-authorian, but at the same time they are dedicated proponents of mob rule.

They did not even use that [silly photo]( of Ross Ulbricht!
@_date: 2013-10-18 06:21:29
This is the point of seasteading, startup cities and economic freezones, to treat laws as commodities and compete by offering a less complicated legal framework.

There is a great chapter in Hazlitt's *[Economics in One Lesson]( that explains the important role of speculators.

Silk Road actually enables more competition causing higher quality drugs and lower prices. This means less drug users risking their lives and less incentives for them to commit theft in order to finance their consumption.

We simply don't let the politicians know about Zerocoin yet. It could be a pleasant surprise. Our protectors have a hard time unserstanding Bitcoin as it is anyway.

Socialism comes in many flavours. I can imagine some free market socialists are big fans. 
@_date: 2013-10-01 22:05:06
Of course they don't. Silk Road does not replace the entire process from production to use, but it reduces the violent competition over geographical areas.

Enlighten me on my errors then.

His "debate" on IP with Stephan Kinsella was really something...

I cannot refer you to any good sources at the moment, but I think I have stumbled upon a few articles recently about new freezones to be established in China, with economic freedom on level with Singapore and HK. Judging by how successfull many zones and entire nations have been, it wouldn't be an all too unexpected development. 
@_date: 2013-10-01 22:15:45
Through logical reasoning. Yes, Silk Road makes up a small share of the market, but hopefully it will grow.
@_date: 2013-05-17 09:55:32
...whatever people voluntarily choose to use as currency.

People just don't have enough things to tell eachother, I think Krugman once said.

What was their take on Bitcoin?
Also, did Matonis go full libertarian?
@_date: 2013-05-21 06:45:13
When Bitcoin has gained enough acceptance by governments, there will be this perfect moment to implement something like Zerocoin.
