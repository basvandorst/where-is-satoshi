Well, I don't get into the math of SSSS, but I do explain that you can split a secret into several shares, and specify that at least X shares are needed to reconstruct the wallet (where you choose the X).
Perhaps I didn't make clear that it's not literally splitting the wallet, which would be insecure.  One share doesn't give you any information about the wallet.
Meh, I tried.

Yes, this is a great idea! For some reason, though, every time I suggest using SSSS on it gets downvoted. There's never an explanation...

I see an easy loophole: "free &lt;additional thing&gt; when you pay with Bitcoin".

I think it would be fairly hard to do a well-controlled experiment with this.  Bitcoin might be the closest we will get :)

What are their incentives to betray the operation, though?

My hypothesis is that gold would still have value if it could not be used for jewelry (for whatever reason).  Bitcoin seems to confirm my hypothesis.

Gold has value mainly because of three things:
* there is a limited supply.
* it can be sub-divided, merged together, and transferred from person to person.
* it has held value historically, by a very large number of people.
Bitcoin has all of these things, and the last point (admittedly the weakest, given that it's less than five years old) will only get stronger over time.
I predict that over the very long term, its continued value depends on three things:
* the security of its crypto and the soundness of the blockchain concept.
* the lack of a better crypto-currency.
* the continued use of the Internet (i.e., the world don't slip into a pre-Internet dark age of some kind).

MultiBit needs a lot of work before it will look good on OS X, unfortunately.  I haven't tried it on other platforms--maybe looks kickass on those.
