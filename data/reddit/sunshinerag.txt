@_date: 2015-12-06 09:38:12
Thanks for the reply.
I would expect the market would determine the best use for the additional supply. It is possible new business models would be found that efficiently uses this supply. This usage will compete with any other utility like storing data on the blockchain. 
I expect we would soon see specialised miners, in terms of miners who will start ordering what will go into a block based on their business needs, like say a miner who will first fill the blocks with only machine 2 machine payments (think 21co) and other varieties.
Eventually different business-economic spheres will have their own miner representation reflecting their real world magnitude and compete for blockspace accordingly.
TLDR, the limited supply would eventually force the real world economics to remain where it is and the bitcoin blockchain only use would be settlement coin for fiat banks.

This approach sounds interesting. One thing I notice is why is everyone treating max block size as THE new minimum block size, don't you think miners are going to read the signals from the other participant of how much block size is acceptable.
@_date: 2015-12-06 11:50:03
mm.. lets consider the scenario with some extreme variables, 
what would happen if a Miner mined and published a very large block say 100mb, which every one else would take significant time to download and verify it, say &gt; 10 minutes. What happens if someone publishes a block in the meantime of size 2mb that others can simultaneously verify in a minute. If the 2mb block is also valid then the 100mb block would be orphaned? I don’t know if this is correct.
Assuming it is, then the miners are *only going to publish a block of a certain size that others are able to download and verify in a time such that no competing block can be found* to avoid their block being orphaned?.
@_date: 2015-12-06 21:52:33
Thanks for the explanation. Reading the "Selfing mining" paper. meanwhile do you know why miners are not maxing out the 1mb blocks right now.?

There is a subtlety to this solution which may or may not be a issue, person 2 and 3 can also combine their keys with one of person 1's key... meaning you can't enforce only 2 and 3 work together make a transaction.. so it is
1 alone

Because "Rooting" as done to mobile devices is more than just unlocking an administrator account.
From wikipedia
"Rooting lets all user-installed applications run privileged commands typically unavailable to the devices in the stock configuration. Rooting is required for more advanced and potentially dangerous operations including modifying or deleting system files,..."
So anything you install post rooting are all potential attack vectors. And thanks for illustrating how a "technologically smart guy" looks like.

Assuming by physical currency you mean fiat, the fiat paper guarantees ownership of a number, the value of which is remotely controlled by the issuer. It's value is as reliable as the issuer's whim. You need to track interest rates, quantitative easing amount etc. to determine how much that number on paper really means.
Re: a goddamn number on the internet that can be hacked.. not sure what you are referring to.. bitcoin is a decentralised currency which you can hold without having a central storage. what you read as getting hacked is not the coins but some central storage that some people left their money on. It is like putting your physical cash under someone else's pillow.

Nice approach. The right way to gently persuade someone to consider and open up to something new.

It's simply because most technologically smart guys are not really that smart. They are just reading up other people's analysis and just applying the instructions. Some of these kind of geeks assume they are geeks because they know how to install some software from the internet and that's it. They are poorly trained in terms of fundamentals and lack critical thinking capabilities. 
In the post you linked, the guy mentioned that he has rooted his phone. Which means he has taken out some of the OS built in protection, that would allow a variety of possible attack vectors. His other defensive mechanims like password protection, backing up elsewhere all are now weak links.
In short, yes be wary of listening to supposed geeks. If you are unable to verify such information yourself it is wise to keep your money away. I presume in the future real banks would emerge, which would hold your BTC funds in some manner and charge you for that. They would take care of these issues. Note these banks would be different from the banks of today who live on cheap printed credit. Of course now you need to evaluate them which might be a step easier than verifying some geek's instruction on the internet.
Note: Coinbase, blockchain etc. are not banks, they are optimised for trading.

Miners work on economic incentives, so yes, higher fees would help. I doubt miners trying to sort by transaction types would work without an economic incentive.
But if the fees keep raising for channel maintenance wouldn't it make running lightning nodes more costly? I wonder. I think lightning protocol implementer should publish a nice scenario by scenario case analysis of what happens if etc.. It would be useful to understand the risks/rewards.

The very process of forming(discovering) consensus differs in each field. If consensus is imposed as THIS IS GOOD FOR YOU because we are philosopher gods (kings) and we say so (platonic) we would just replicate the same fatal flaw of Fiat based systems in here albeit with different rules.
Both sides should continue to promote why their consensus rules are better over others and a discovery process among various participant types would yield different user bases (forks). Forks while threatening now might be the wall that we learn to master.
The Fork process would inform all parties of the values the other sides have and each side would strive to accommodate as much as possible while continuing to differ on some unresolvable differences.
I can understand why at initial stages Satoshi and original team could have been cautious of forks. Bitcoin was a hostile idea for most people ... the idea had to be seeded and people had to question everything they thought were normal (Fiat, money supply, distribution, government role) and choose Bitcoin over it. Now that process is largely done we should move on to experimenting with forks IMHO.

I think Core should use whatever they think differentiates their implementation of the consensus protocol and appeals to their specific userbase. 
Maybe "Lightning Bitcoin"? That would indicate it is the first implementation experimenting/bringing on a unique way to scale bitcoin.

Blockstream 1MBcoin does not communicate what it is about exactly. I was under the assumption that Core is much more than block stream with particular ideas of scaling and other enhancements. Closing the source would work, similar to R3CEV coin or whatever that appeals to a particular client base.
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:39:47

or the miners may choose to serve a different set of users.
@_date: 2016-01-17 13:08:40
I more see parallels to what happened with browsers HTML specs.. There can be multiple competing implementations but still agree on a common set of rules.
I too have been following Core for last few years and I think it is amazing (except the GUI client). protocol work is awesome though I think testing and modularisation of code can improve.
As I said if you publish your stuff as open source and accept contributions as open source you obey the rules of the chosen license, which in this case perfectly allows other implementations to fork and add their own variations/contributions. It is not necessary all the forks might survive though, that depends on which fork gets user base attention.
Considering Bitcoin is an experiment to see if people can voluntarily accept a different economic model compared to Fiat money (this is right, take it and you can't leave it), consensus will eventually emerge based on user adoption.
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:23:32

Why haven't they censored transactions already? do you think it is because of fear of protocol developers (or) potential loss of interest by the market on bitcoin. Unlike Fiat, bitcoin is a voluntary system. If people don't like its properties (ex: censored bitcoins) then they reject it and the miner loses revenue.
Or is the real fear that people might choose to want censorship?

Blockstream's products are built on the premise that the main chain is broken and large institutions with frequent and/or transfers are facing severe issues due to the main chain constraints, hence a product (liquid) to move inter-institution transfers to a sidechain. This is probably going to be commercialised as fees charged by the federation that maintains the pegged chain system.
Obviously if the main chain has no such problems there is no need for a federation and a product to move value between big institutions.
@_date: 2017-08-06 12:45:57
if the hash power for the 1mb chain is too low, won't it be the one that will be dumped, exchanges are also likely to label the segwit2x chain as the Bitcoin chain due to the hash rate driving more purchases towards that vs the 1mb chain.

As a hodler who supports blocksize increase via BU or classic now is that I am a user who is looking for a currency which is both a store of value AND for everyday purchases. Most importantly I think that a currency that exists only as a store of value and not for everday purchases will eventually be defeated in it's primary role. 
I think so mostly by observing why gold has failed to displace fiat all this time. Fiat rules the everyday purchase role. And the cost to convert gold to fiat is non-negligible (taxes, govt. intervention). If the same were to happen to bitcoin, it's value as store of value will keep falling.
Improving adoption and making it a day to day currency will greatly increase it's store of value. Bitcoin should not aim to just be digital gold as gold was a failure to counter fiat.

it would be nice if there was a mechanism to create a historical snapshot proof, so you wouldn't always need to start from block 0. It's also possible a future node keeps part of its blocks in a long term storage and only some in fast random access medium. It is inevitable.

I imagine, eventually we will need some form of semi trusted nodes. Let's say if my requirement is to quickly check my wallet balance and I don't have the blockchain at all. I have marked some of my peers as relatively highly trusted than other peers. I just download proofs(hypothetical) for blocks 1-10000.. instead of full blocks and start downloading from a recent snapshot proof.
This should consume less bandwidth and initial sync should be fast. the user should also have an option to fully download everything if needed. 
More than high speed bandwidth, as long as users have access to cost effective unlimited downloads, it should be fine, as blocks are only once every 10 minutes. 
Full nodes should also be designed to run in independent hardware not desktops, like bit seed. Combining the wallet + full node is a poor user experience.

and they get to decide how to secure the network. That is the incentive mechanism in the protocol. They are not employed by the developers but an actor in the system. They are a sort of proxy of determining what the market wants out of bitcoin as they risk/invest their resources upfront for a possible return. 
Ignoring miner concerns by a bitcoin protocol developer implies a disconnect by the developer from market realities.

As per 
"Outsourcable enforcement: if one party closes a channel in an old state in an attempt to steal money, the other party has to act within a defined period of time to block the attempted theft. This function can be outsourced to a third-party without giving them control over any funds, allowing wallets to safely go offline for periods longer than the defined period."
What happens when a party does not block the channel close in a defined period of time. Considering channel state monitoring is essential to transact on the channel... every wallet has to have a way to either itself monitor the channel state or rely on another node that monitors it on their behalf?
@_date: 2017-04-11 18:18:47

To be more precise, isn't it **evolution** of consensus layers the issue here. Any changes to consensus are not only at odds with other implementations but also with the current dominant implementation.
In this context **segwit** too is an evolution to the consensus layer. 
The Q is how best to evolve a newer consensus layer.  or how to decide which is the better? 
It is ok to warn people that adopting a particular client will isolate them on the network or cause other issues or raise bugs with a particular consensus implementation. Is it ok to prevent discussion of the same though?

@_date: 2017-04-29 11:09:00
precisely, everyone should realize that though core can write code, it is up to users to decide whether to run it or any of the alternative clients. Considering that is there are now multiple clients, it is interesting to see core developers reporting bugs and discussing approaches with other client implementations. Core has no monopoly on the preferred client. This sub definitely operated early on a single client model but looks like it is changing to allow discussion of alternate clients.

if the POW changes, the changed one would be treated as an altcoin. the current bitcoin based on POW would continue regardless.
@_date: 2017-04-17 10:58:05
Yes the technical part is getting there ... however the requirements to be constantly online to check channel status etc... would make it difficult to integrate it with wallets... you would need a lightning server provider which will likely become centralized providers again ... it would be interesting to see how practical lightning is on litecoin once segwit is active.

really why can't Sergio speak his mind? Bitcoin Shuns politics? Bitcoin is a political movement. I bought bitcoin because of that. If it isn't going to displace the fiat political movement then it is a failure. Could you do us a favor and stop wasting everyone's time?
@_date: 2017-04-22 21:12:59
by that definition, each time the protocol changes by some nodes and there is a non-zero number of nodes that did not change... the ones who changed are altcoins ... while the ones who did not change are Bitcoin. is that correct?

There could be overlap between all 3.

mmm .. nearly none of the points you listed are something the bitcoin protocol can guarantee, what you are putting as a prerequisite is a kind of continuous governance model enforced outside the protocol. An alt-government. I think there was a couple of alt-coins building that as a layer or building some central points where they can coordinate changes to uphold such features.

@_date: 2017-05-17 15:38:44
agreed. The order is something important, even a UASF segwit if it works (doubtful) will not deliver the scaling increase in time for businesses or for new users in terms of adoption. Core should have coded a blocksize increase to be activated after segwit increase. That should have given confidence to both businesses &amp; miners. Now I think it is too late.
We will see user adoption falling or businesses exiting bitcoin I think.

@_date: 2017-05-08 16:58:11
Those are signals and should not be confused as consensus. Each of those centralized polling platforms has their own issues and I am not sure it is a good idea to give them so much weight. 
This trend on relying on non-hash power consensus is worrying. It reminds me of people in fractional reserve economies continuously voting to raise the debt level and populism rules. Without the POW aren't we merely recreating the same environment here.?
What if a future hypothetical userbase starts a facebook campaign to raise the 21M limit? 
@_date: 2015-10-23 19:57:54


Maybe. But they need not be intentional. The issue will be moot as alternative implementations to core take root.
@_date: 2017-05-08 17:54:17
I am sorry but your observations are incorrect. Miners have a huge disincentive not to get out of alignment with their user's needs. This may seem odd to you. Because you consider yourself to be a user whose needs (protocol upgrade) etc. are not being met but for a miner who is burning resources if the price of bitcoin is not maintained at substantial levels he loses big time and exits the market.
Now why is the bitcoin price going up (demand) even with supposedly broken hash power and lack of protocol upgrades. because for now there are existing and new users who far outweigh you in economic power and continue to buy bitcoins. This demand is at a level where it is sufficient for miner's to continue with this state as long as they can.
These users may not necessarily participate in Reddit discussions or twitter polls. the only way they indicate acceptance is by buying bitcoins. They would also sell if they think their needs are not being met.. not a good store of value, can't use for microtransactions etc. the only way to measure it is by observing the price in the market.
Now if I am a user like you who want's protocol improvements to improve transaction speed etc. understanding bitcoin's protocol, the options available to me are
start mining myself with the parameters I want (or)
set up a mining firm specializing in mining research and outcompete the current miners (capitalism).
If none of these options are possible and the system does not serve my purpose I will exit and sell all my holdings to others for whom the current configuration is acceptable.
@_date: 2017-05-20 16:15:39

Yes. But you are oversharing sensitive info if you take the poll. The coinbase api should have allowed limited information about the coinbase user after authenticating.
@_date: 2015-02-19 20:37:34
It would be great if you can. At the minimum it should be a signed installer/app so I don't have to tell users to allow unsigned apps.

they are at odds because there is a single dev team for the protocol. As Bitcoin becomes multi-dev teams this will abate itself.

but but but greg told ....
@_date: 2017-06-22 17:51:41
I hope so. But I can't say it is implausible. The design of the protocol implies an overhead to maintain a well-functioning hub. Considering in order to scale the hub you need to lock in capital in proportion, it is likely only big corporations will maintain yet. There would also be a competition for channel open/close transactions with the 1mb fee market which eventually only large entitites can probably afford the fees for channel maintenance. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:23:23

looks like the discount part of segwit is implemented as it is. the discussion was indeed to understand why the discount was needed. jgarzik must not have been aware of all the reasonings as he was out of loop for a while. looks like jameson set him right and adam gave the background. so moving on.

For opening/closing channel you have to compete in the 1mb fee market. Hopefully, you don't need to frequently create channels. Not sure what is the risk with a long-lived channel.
I suspect there will be 3rd parties offering channel creation/monitoring as you need a software agent to cont. monitor the channel state.
@_date: 2017-06-24 19:34:42
heart surgery, marathon... hmm now you have turned into propaganda mode by choosing emotional terms.
Bitcoin is always going to be running. So this analogy is moot. What is needed is a way to iterate and improve on it while it is running. Testnet, staggered rollouts are various ways the risks can be minimised. The risks are borne by the people who can't any way stand the status quo.
There are far more complex systems which have gone through upgrades. So comparing it with flights and scared passengers isn't going to cause anything. Feel free to sit this one out, that is the nature of the decentralised protocol right. 
I for one am keen to see how the Bitcoin protocol will handle this upgrade. The outcome will let me know whether it has a worthy future.
@_date: 2017-07-13 06:22:00




It depends on the incentive, it is going to cost the miners dearly if their signaling led the network to choose a chain which if they betray they get orphaned. 
Is it going to cost a node dearly if they have just been toggling flags? They can easily change their mind and switch with no apparent loss making their signaling a less important one for others in the system.
