This is like saying "Aaaand we're back in the sunshine, so much for the 'rain'!!!" after a rainstorm has passed.

[Dodd-Frank, for starters]( which has now been repealed by Trump. Look forward to another 2008 served hot and steamy real soon.

What does "treated like sluts" mean? We are talking about rape. So when a girl is a "slut," she has no basis to complain when she gets raped? Wtf is wrong with you?

...to be fair? To whom? The rapist? What the fuck is wrong with you?


You don't belong in this century

"treated like sluts" is a quote from you. That's why I put it in quotes. So yeah, you did say that. Feel free to check out what a quotation is, the dictionary is free and online. 
You asked a loaded question that implied that you think women who "dress like sluts" deserve to be "treated like sluts" (still no answer from you on what this means). So far, the only treatment of women that has been discussed in this thread is rape.

Because the market cap of gold is $6.5 trillion dollars. Billion dollar moves mean nothing in that market, so they can't manipulate it the way the OP is explaining they can for Bitcoin.

Congrats on paying double the price for your coffee as compared to everyone else

No, my comment has absolutely nothing to do with the price of Bitcoin

QuadrigaCX is your best bet. Coinsquare is another option, but their fees are shitty and in my opinion Quadriga is the better exchange, even though fewer people use it.

GDAX is Coinbase. Just log into GDAX and your coins will be there.

What? So do I. I just don't understand why anyone would consciously choose to pay for coffee with something that charges you a fee that is the same price as the coffee, even though money works perfectly well. It makes literally no sense to do that.
