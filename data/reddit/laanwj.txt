This is not a new problem, there have been reports going back as far as 2014. See  . It was never considered a big problem when Bitpay still accepted manual payments, but now it is. From the Bitpay side this could be solved by adding the API pages to an exclusion list of Cloudflare, so that no captcha appears there. From the wallet side this is virtually impossible to handle as-is.
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:33:08
Finally a stand-alone interface for payment protocol, great, thank you!
The most annoying thing about Bitpay mandating payment protocol is that sometimes Cloudflare responses get in the way. Wallets are unable to handle this. E.g.  . It is not even clear how to handle this from the side of the wallet, as answering the captcha requires a browser. The only solution I can think of is some unholy tangle of "browser  integration" but that raises attack surface concerns, at least :(

People contribute to open source usually because they have an itch to scratch while using the software, or just because they find something interesting to write. I don't think "exposure" is a very common reason, although having something public to point prospective employers to may help for some coding jobs.
@_date: 2015-12-17 17:10:58
But this isn't your average company. If you hired devs then you're right to tell them to solve your issues and complain if they don't.
Personally I work on bitcoin core because P2P software, security and cryptography interests me. I don't have much interest in user interfaces, and no amount of "you should be doing this instead" shaming will change that. I'd gladly merge patches by you that improve things though.
It may be something personal and dumb that I have feelings, but I don't like to be told I have no imagination. At least where I live it is just as unacceptable to say that to a colleague at your company, no matter how bad their code is.

Yay for the new developers who not actually write code, but write wonderful science fiction about the future of bitcoin. Woo them who have spent years working on the actual network as they may insist on inconvenient realities, and they who call for restrained step by step progress. We don't need them anymore. In this new era we only want optimistic visions and whitepapers, and dream. Let the fractal block trees grow to fill the skies, so that we can climb to the moon!

It will only go into that code if your node is listening for external connections (directly, not through a hidden service). In that case you're advertising your node's IP to the world anyhow.
But if - for some reason - you dislike connecting to these services you can bypass the polling by providing the external IP using the `-externalip=&lt;ip&gt;` command-line option.

Yeah - issues automatically get closed when a commit mentions the issue id. That's part of the workflow on github.

Right, let's make Bitcoin look like the world's butt joke with silly PR battles. I'm disappointed in you Cody. This has nothing to do with anarchism anymore.
Bitcoin foundation is not a structure of power thus resisting it makes no sense at all, it's like protesting against a newspaper. You can freely ignore it and do your own thing.
All this infighting is wasted energy, that could be put into improving or promoting Bitcoin instead.

Using one of these may be a more successful avenue of research:  . If you could mine in a CTC you could effectively hash infinitely fast, as you could base your computation on the future result. Now, the challenge is to find or create one, but I'm sure you'll come up with something.
(thank Charles Stross in Singularity Sky for the idea)
@_date: 2014-08-04 08:29:03
The bitcoin foundation is *not* in charge of Bitcoin Core development. Yes, they fund some of the developers (including me) to keep the lights on in the project, but they do not make top-down decisions about it. 
Though it's hard to say in an open source project, the decision-making is as close to a flat non-hierarchical model as you can get in practice. If you want proof just follow the bickering on github for a few days.
"The amount of money and resources invested into the core team". Uhm. No, not that much actually. More developers would be welcome, and it would be good if they were funded by other organizations and not the BF (which *is* a central point of failure).
@_date: 2014-11-17 10:53:46


I'm fairly sure you're right. Although "terrorism" is only very vaguely defined, the purported goal of groups like ISIS is to attack western civilization and its "perverted" values. Bitcoin, along with the internet, is anathema to their vision. Tech savvy or not, I can't imagine them throwing in their lot with it.

What I see there is that people were investigating within an hour, action was taken not much later. What are you complaining about? 
What more can you expect, especially from an unofficial website mostly run by volunteers? I agree with gavinandresen that, maybe, it's you.
@_date: 2014-10-31 09:11:07


...and what exactly have you done to help this along? Does it make you feel happy to sit along the sidelines, complaining what a few already overworked people have not yet come up with magical solutions?
Did you know that bitcoin is an open source community-driven project? People like you are too much locked in the idea that a central group will solve your issues if you just wait hard enough.
Changes like this are intermediate steps toward a goal. Each step needs extensive testing and review to make sure that no regressions happen.
@_date: 2014-10-17 08:42:10
This is certainly not the way it's supposed to be. 
At least I have never, that I remember, called anyone names for submitting a pull request or an idea, and usually try to be patient and understanding. And if something angers me I try to not comment at all, although I have lost my temper a few times if people start off ranting.
I have seen some vile and crazy things thrown *at* the developers, especially in places like reddit or twitter. I also agree that the Bitcoin community in general is a reasonably hostile place. But I've always believed that the development community isn't that bad.
Seeking for "bad language" like "fucking" in the github issues doesn't yield anything serious either: 
Can you send me a private mail giving details, and concrete examples? Who is this person trying to be Bitcoin's "bad ass" Linus? Can we solve it with him directly instead of making a circus out of it?

No, he can't delete all the Bitcoins on testnet nor mainnet :) What happened is that testnet3, as the name implied, is the third testnet chain. It's started afresh with a new genesis block. That doesn't 'delete' the old chain, if someone still has that around they could mine on it on, but no one cares. That would never happen for the main chain, the new coin would be seen as just another altcoin.

Wut, attack vector? I don't see how this can be attacked externally. It is just a simple python script that executes queries through RPC the same way that bitcoin-cli does and shows the information in one screen. Some of you guys are too paranoid. Just read the code and decide for yourself instead of spreading FUD.

That's a very good question. It's a pity this is all the way at the bottom. Why does bitcoin still have only one foundation? If 'the' bitcoin foundation is so bad, what stops people from starting their own and partaking in development? It's not like 'the' BF has some unique ownership right.
My guess is also that the BF is doing pretty well, and that the group of loud, bitter people doesn't know how to do things better in practice.

In my opinion most likely it will transition to a server tool (infrastructure/node background process). That's where most of the development work is done: in making it faster and more convenient to set up a full node.
Although you can never be sure with an open source project, developers *may* suddenly start contributing en-masse to the wallet, but I doubt it. It should be split off in any case: a full node and wallet in one makes no sense. A wallet should be online only when you use it, while a full node is only useful when it has a lot of uptime. It also makes less and less sense to maintain user-facing and highly-critical consensus code in one repository.
In any case - other wallets are usually a much better choice for users.

It's an ongoing process on the master branch. Some pull requests that refactor the code in the right direction have been merged, some are still open (like  other work is still in progress. There is also an initial prototype by Matt Corallo: 
0.10 will have a script verification library, an entire consensus library (including UTXO management) will likely be in 0.11. There are people impatient and building entire bitcoind as a shared library right now   - but that's necessarily hacky before a stable interface is decided upon.

Yes, this! When calling for testing in a lot of cases what is needed is just for people to use it as they do normally, in their specific setup, with their specific configuration, and report whether it behaves like them expect it to, and provide stack traces/debug.log excerps on crashes.

Indeed. In itself it's good to have a healthy dose of paranoia in these territories. One goal of cryptocurrency is to be able to check for yourself instead of relying on trust. Unfortunately, some people mistake this for distrusting everything indiscriminately, or even as a challenge to think of the weirdest and most far-fetched theories.

A message that contains the alert key is encrypted to him - as well as a few other people, which I won't reveal for privacy and personal security reasons.
I am not sure whether he ever actually had access to it. He at least never used it. The part about the Japanese police is completely hypothetical. But it is only one example of how the key could have leaked to untrusted parties since 2010.
The idea of having an anonymous, opaque group, possessing a single key that is able to send messages that appear in 99% of clients shouldn't be giving anyone the fuzzies. I am honestly surprised that this is controversial for some people. 
In the same argument as against the FBI 'golden keys', there is no way to ensure that only those 'pure of heart' get hold of the key.
@_date: 2016-03-24 14:35:21
To be clear: this change went into the master branch, which will be 0.13, which will be released halfway this year.
I don't rule out *ever* publishing it, for history's sake. But don't you think it's terribly irresponsible to publish the key while almost all of the network is still running software that listens to the alerts?
(that's exactly the situation we're trying to avoid, we're removing this system preemptively *before* someone leaks the key, accidentally or deliberately. There is a lot of confusion about who has it, that should be enough reason...)
@_date: 2014-10-20 08:10:35
To be clear: In my interview I was talking about diversity in everything *but* the consensus code. So the network code, the wallet, the memory pool policy, the user interfaces, the RPC, the databases, and so on and so on. That's (at least) 90% of the code of Bitcoin Core.
The consensus code is going to move to a library starting with 0.10, so that it can be used by other implementations either as authoritative or if not, as a "second opinion" for validation. Having diversity in the consensus code could be dangerous, but that shouldn't distract from innovation in other areas.

It's mostly just a matter of: so much to do, so few people to do it. The Bitcoin Core project could really use more active contributors. Additionally, privacy features are usually quite abstract and hard to implement (esp correctly!), so there are fewer people even able to implement them.

Signing/verifying mail is complicated in all kinds of ways by mail programs and list managers alike... it took me three times to submit the 0.11.0 release notes and have it verify correctly
The key is also signed with my key in GPG itself (should be on the keyserver). That'd be the best place to check if you're paranoid.

That's one way of looking at it. I don't think you're wrong. If you want a solution to get started with a node quickly it's not for you, there are even pre-built VM images for that.
But for many people the idea of running a node on a small portable low-power box that you can attach to the network everywhere is an exciting idea (if you use Tor HS you don't have to worry about port forwarding).
Arguably they also learn a bit about embedded development, which is the point of the Raspberry series. During all that waiting you can read the source code and documentation! :-)

Raspberry Pi 2 has 4 ARM cores, which is fast enough for validation (most of my own nodes run on ARM boxes), although catching up with the chain will (obviously) take longer than on a meaty PC - you *could* copy the data directory from a PC to skip this.
The 1MB of memory is a bit on the low side, so you may have to do some tweaking (see 
For compilation I'd recommend to do cross-compile (from say, an Ubuntu PC) using the depends system and copy executables. It is possible to compile on the device itself, but it is slow and you may run into memory full issues (see  ).
Edit: also you need to connect an external HD for data directory. Do not use USB sticks or MMC for this, apart from the expensive storage they also tend to burn out pretty quickly under this kind of usage.

That's a weird and manipulative question which tells me that you've already come to a conclusion. Anecdotally, a look at the credits in a major release makes it evident that many people contribute happily 
As outlined in the grandparent post, the kind of work that I do differs from what most contributors do. I mostly facilitate the contributors and try to safeguard the coherence of the project. In general, full-time developers can learn the code on a deeper level and focus on the long term. In contrast to most other contributors which are motivated to scratch their own itch and move on.

Can't speak for others but I was doing this before any funding and I'm not leaving. I'll still be maintainer of Bitcoin Core. As I do need to keep paying my rent, no longer being funded means that I can dedicate less time to it, it will go back to an occupation in my spare time, but I will still do my best.
Expecting people to consistently do work of altruism (or "general interest and curiosity") is a mistake, though. *Especially* in a financially-oriented project like this. But even outside that, open source development doesn't run on magic. Nearly all large open source projects have a skeleton staff of paid developers. Maintaining a software project is more work than applying a patch here and there, the organizational aspects (as well as testing, reviewing, communicating with contributors) take a lot of time.

bitcoind has supported UPnP almost since almost the beginning. It is a bit of a hit and miss, with some routers it works reliably not with others. Forwarding a port is the most dependable way.

That's great! No, I had not heard of that.
@_date: 2015-03-25 11:17:34

@_date: 2015-03-20 05:52:36
How would you even measure the impact? No matter what else, if your goal is to increase the number of nodes, discouraging anyone from running a full node can not be a winning strategy.
I understand the idea to not encourage Bitcoin Core to novice users that want to play around with some dust, they have no stake so they are less likely to feel 'altruistic' toward the network. But wasn't that already the idea of offering a list of wallets with pros/cons on bitcoin.org? This is a solved problem.
I think what would be useful on bitcoin.org is a more thorough, friendly, frank, honest guide about running a full node. 'How to support the network'.

As said by others: most block database corruption issues and crashes are due to hardware issues. For example, CPU overheating or bad RAM. Bitcoin Core tends to show these issues more than other software because the (multi-threaded) validation is very CPU-heavy. Also anti-virus software is known to interfere in some cases (there is  mitigation for this under way, see 
That said, it's not impossible that there are some windows specific issues. Open source is a volunteer effort. Nearly all of the people contributing to Bitcoin Core are using MacOSX and/or Linux. If any developers want to contribute towards improving the state of Windows support they're very welcome.

I'm happy to see this. I have thought about selling dedicated nodes myself, but never followed through.
