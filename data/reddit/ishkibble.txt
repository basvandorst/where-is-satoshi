He's apart of the market, sure, just as am I.
I agree that in a completely 'free' environment, the strongest companies (monopolies) will rise, for better or worse. I'm just calling out this guy as a hypocrite for calling for manipulation of an open system. I wonder how quintin3265 would feel if BTChina did a 51% attack and/or forked the bitcoin chain. I'm not saying he can't or shouldn't do it. This is the internet, he's gonna do whatever he feels like, just like I'm going to do what I feel like doing. I'm simply telling him to go fuck himself for his call to arms.

What if you already have a large amount of BTC and you go back and forth occasionally? Lets saw I already have a bunch of BTC in MtGox and doing a few swaps would take no time at all. Also Let's say I'm not interested in withdrawing as cash. Would you still say it's not worth it?
Note: (unfortunately) I do not have lots of bitcoins or a MtGox acct but the logic seems sound, given you are prepared for it of course.
Edit: never mind, just realized I wasn't understand the question correctly.

One word: Liquidity. While I think the current price of $200ish is abnormal and mostly due to speculation, these prices are possible because 1) people are willing to buy bitcoins and 2) people are willing to sell bitcoins.

He didn't steal anything. While walking down the street you find a $100 bill, pick it up, and keep it. Are you going really tell me that you stole $100 from the person who lost it? If I am careless with my money (or bitcoins) and loose them then that is my problem, no the receiver's problem.
tl;dr: Fuck you, he isn't a thief.

That's because you'd be breaking the contract you signed with the bank when you opened the account. With Bitcoins theres no contracts. Unsavory as it may seem the onus is on the sender to ensure the proper amount is sent.

Cool story bro, but your post reeks of butthurt. I find it strange that you are advocating for the exact thing you are probably against. Control. You don't control BTC, I don't, no one does. But here you are trying to control it, or rather, control other coins.
Here's what I have to say: go fuck yourself with your control. Whatever you or I think is irrelevant; the free-market will decide. Trying to sway it one way or another is futile and just makes you look like a scared noob.
EDIT: Grammar.

Wow is right. Here's another commenter -Boghog "And that is way they need to regulate it. You cannot have currency moved out of government control or it destabilises the government." Holy shit. Is this guy just stoopid or a shill?
