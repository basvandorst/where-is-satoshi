Ok, Infinite number is not correct.
There is no network topology in any number of dimensions that is without upper bound (with respect to average node hops per message) so as to not start falling down the other side of its bell curve with respect to one or more of speed, signal fidelity (information degradation), and signal/information volume (in this case number of txs). 
Different topologies have different strengths and so are chosen for different purposes. You can tweak them. You can hybridize them, but there's still an upper threshold that must be prevented (in real world deployments) so as to maintain acceptable network operation with respect to one or more of the above 3 properties (as well as to prevent disaster). (Notice that cost is not even one of the 3. An infinite budget cannot force any topology to perform in an impossible way.)
That's why I'm asking. There is a max scalar or a max ratio. If you don't know what it is that's fine too.

It will be a selling point. Around half a year ago there was a hubbub about blockfolio storing identities. I think the outcome was that they study everyone's portfolio and trades but don't know who's who. 
Anyway, you'd need know that this is important to everyone. Either you're evil and gathering data to sell to nations, or your studying the patterns and claiming that nothing can be traced back, or, doing something in between, even perhaps for a fee, and being exquisitely honest about it. 
People will care which one you choose.

@_date: 2018-01-21 01:28:02
Ok. Let's keep politics out of it and keep our eyes on the tx count.
Well actually, BTC is currently engineered to intentionally max out the tx rate in order to develop a fee market, if I understand correctly, so that I guess having at least a little mempool is the only assurance that there is a fee market. So... As a BTC holder I should be happy if the mempool is large? No wait- small?

So Tether is used to sit between trades, but just as significantly to store value wired into the account prior to a buy. 
Then there could be a new type of exchange that converted your wire into a market order that executed when your money arrived. Then they can operate without Tethers, without regulatory hassle, and still allow people to buy in with cash. 
Would that work?

Ver is kinda like you. He really speaks his mind and explains to other people what he honestly thinks.
Unlike you, he is strong enough, sure enough, brave enough, to speak his mind in front of other real people, on camera, including those that disagree, and regardless how many thousands of people are watching him or a stream. He does this consistently, and always has, using his real name. He is a brave confident mofo.
To summarize, you are nothing like Ver.

So well designed that extensive research and simulations determined that 1mb is the optimal blocksize. Not 1.277. Not 0.6881. Not 2.0004. The system was well designed by the inventor. Certainly not at all optimised by its unwanted babysitter.

Saving is nothing more than a habit. 
Saving is a*good* habit, a great habit, but it's not learning.
Teaching about personal finance management in school is desperately needed. 
What is sweet but only a step sideways, is teaching the single habit of hodling. 
Hodling makes hodlers believe they only need to do something once and stop learning.
A nonlearner and his stash are eventually parted.
Teach learning.

You can find better opinions than mine. But yes I feel certain that if you just wait it out you can grab it for that or lower. 
Do look at the correction history. BTC has had serious run-up without a retrace footing confirmation or even much of a breather. It might even be supported by unbacked Tether. (Find this post and read it). Plus it has the miner competition with the new Bitcoin (which I prefer to btc because more upside and less risky imho, but hey both are high risk). All these challenges and it still goes up? Be wary. And good luck. Just look at the lifetime of the coin and note that it always corrects once in a while. ... It is due.
When it does correct, take a closer look at the other Bitcoin and the shared hashpower history and listen to ppl like adrian-x , a miner. Then choose.
Bitcoin between now and December is the riskiest major coin there is. You can probably get some safe mileage out of ETC until the correction. Barry is grooming it for institutional investment and it will certainly come whether it deserves it or not.
I'll pm you this in case the cops don't like my thoughts.

Money is awesome! Money greases the wheels! Money makes a lot of things much easier. 
But once you grease the wheels, extra grease doesn't change anything at all. It's just wasted grease that falls onto the tracks. 
Imagine how much money you want, and why that number. 
     $10k for my sister to pay off her car
     $28k to pay off my house
     $100k for the gift budget, just to buy stuff for my friends for the rest of my life
     $80k for all my future plane tickets
     Etc etc
No matter how far you go with the "etc etc" it still levels off somewhere in the millions. (If you're crazy and just want the biggest Castle in the world with gold nose hair clipper operated by virgins, then you're odd on the far off side of the bell curve.) So it levels off​ in the millions and you're fine in the money Dept. Ok triple it. Well, RV has been North of that for years, so he's not trying to go further north. He's after more interesting higher goals than that. You get rich enough you start space-x. You get rich enough you start Tesla. You get rich enough you rescue Bitcoin so that poor people can still use it.

But this also requires that everyone keeps reconfiguring the mempool so that it can expand as large as it wants over the next 1000 years.

Is this correct? What is the limit at the moment?

I've been here for years and no, elimination of L2 was never a rabid demand at all. Most big blockers, including RV, were never against L2. They just want it considered later when it's needed, not now when L1 still has plenty of room to run, enlarge and increase adoption while at the same time being cheap and fast as usual from 2009-2015. Some big blockers are even fine with segwit, such as Gavin. Their common objection is simply, "jeez, let's get max mileage and adoption quick from L1 while the establishment can't catch up. Because more adoption means harder to take it down."

Kind of weird that Tim doesn't ask Nick at all about the merits of the opposing viewpoint. Weird because (1) Tim had done his homework for this interview and (2) at this point in the podcast where Nick mentions graphite, they all suddenly laugh in agreement but they laugh before Nick finishes the phrase. So they don't actually know what they're laughing at yet. 
Tim is impressed by his guest but he is no sycophant, and not shy. The explanation is of course that this section of the interview was heavily edited. That's fine, it's his show. But I'm disappointed because it's what I most wanted Nick to talk more about, and it's just cut out!  Why? (The other thing glaringly missing from the interview is Tim asking or even teasing NS about being SN. As if there were agreements about no-go subjects. And BTW why does Nick need a handler? (Although I did enjoy naval being there.))
Besides that, it's a fascinating show.

@_date: 2013-11-17 04:20:20
Yes.  Good questions.  These focus on the coins carrying some negative stigma from past uses.  But mixing might also be beneficial to erase positive or neutral stigma.
- Maybe the wallet gets "made" in the future as a famous person's wallet, or a rich person, or a person who bought super early, or a law enforcers wallet, or a politicians wallet.  
- Mixing resets the last currency price point paid by the wallet owner.

As the OP says, 
"put together whatever [world] markets you think bitcoin can adopt, and a percentage and come up with a number. divide by 11.6 million bitcoins, or 21 million bitcoins. then divide that by the number of months you think it will take bitcoin to get there. What do you come up with?"
here's my go:
never mind applebees, llama socks, and teslas.
let's just consider the most ideal sectors of the economy to use bitcoin, which would not be hindered by any govt's regulation:
1. sending money: 0.25T for BTC
remittance biz worldwide is $0.5T.   charges range from 6% in southeast asia to 12% in africa.  global avg=9%
it's safe to say btc and/or ltc can steal half of that business, since it's easy to provide the service for less than 9% in spite of volatility, govt threat, or crash fear.  fuck western union, wells fargo, etc.
2. offshore stashing:  0.6T for BTC
article states 12T - 32T is held offshore.  lets take 5% of the conservative end of that market. 
3. ecommerce: 0.1T for BTC
ecommerce has over a trillion in economic activity. 
if you've ever paid an etailer in btc you know first hand this is a perfect marriage. 
even so, lets say amazon and ebay STILL never adopt it.  
but even if usa terms it outright "illegal," many websites will use it both in and out of the usa.
let's take &lt;10% of that market.
4. black market: 0.2T for BTC
the usa black market alone is 2T.
let's take 10% of that. = .2T
5. gambling: 0.05T for BTC
call it half a trillion and acknowledge a giant growth rate due to btc itself. 
let's take just 10% of that. = .05T
Total adoption we could easily expect to see as long as it doesn't "break" = 1.2T
this is btc activity that would take place whether or not a govt said it was ok.
this is without any govts or banks or major corps embracing it.
(there are many corporations and govts already embracing it, but we are leaving them out.)
currency eventually available
BTC: 21M btc eventually is created
LTC: 84M.  imho, we need to include litecoin, because there is no reason it can't serve these same markets (except maybe stashing) given the current network of nodes and capability.  scrappy businessmen will put it to use.  if ltc becomes accepted alongside btc, being 4x as common, then lets assume 4 will equal one btc.  
so the total amount of goocoin out there will be 42M btc worth (or 168M ltc worth of goocoin).  lets stick to using btc as a unit.
$1,200,000,000,000 conservative market cap of use / 42,000,000 coins &gt; $28k/btc (or $7/ltc)
i recently read an estimate that 30% of BTC are lost/irrecoverable from the times when it was not very valuable and it was thrown away with old hard disks.  but lets just keep it conservative and pretend all coins are already mined, and none are lost.
i think that the above conservative fractions of adoption will happen within 5yrs (if it doesn't break) = 60months
($28k-$1k current value)=27k/60months= an increase in btc value of ~$450/mon, IF all the coins were already mined.  I'm going to leave it this way, conservative as hell.
i want to stress what the OP did: of course it's not going to be linear growth from here to there.  there will necessarily be massive volatility.  but this calculation MIGHT help you answer yourself when at some future point you ask yourself, "is this a bubble?"
just take the number of months into the future from jan/2014, multiple by $450 and add $1000.  
lets try next halloween: 1000+(10*450)=$5500.  if btc is going for $5000 next time youre trick-or-treating, that's no bubble.
