This happened at my work as well. Now everyone there hates bitcoin because they associate it with criminals.

Is this the case for TigerDirect.ca as well? Please say yes :)

Hey thanks for the suggestion. Someone else suggested that I reset the blockchain and that worked. Case closed :)

I agree. What is wrong with giving a sincere thank you? Or in OP's case, what's wrong with a simple hand wave to say thank you? I would hate for it to be social norm that you have to tip someone every time they do something nice for you. The world would be a terrible place.

What makes $150 any more realistic than $500?

I downloaded a program called NetSpeedMonitor. At the end of the day I'm going to match that against what my ISP says I've used just to double check.
I managed to find a few people who have said they used a lot of data and it was because of the Bitcoin wallet they used. I'm not sure if there is any truth to that, but I switched to Multibit because I thought it would save me from downloading the entire blockchain (not sure if I got that correctly) if I used Qt instead.

I tried this on Chrome and it didn't work. I tried it on IE and it worked. It didn't work on IE when I opened up multiple videos though. I could only have 1 tab open at a time and watch each video one by one.

69 degrees. It's running 10 degrees cooler than my previous card.

Seems to be working well now. Thanks for the suggestion :)
