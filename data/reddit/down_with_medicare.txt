Exactly. I run a business too (and accept bitcoins) [posting from a throwaway because I may get a little opinionated here]. My margins are razor slim and my average sale gross is $12 USD. Not much, I know. I sell consumer goods, and gross about 5% of what he does annually. 
Well a few months ago I had a wholesale order (~US$1,000) get destroyed in shipment. Obviously it was my responsibility to make sure the customer received their order in perfect condition, so I had to pay for the replacement. At this point I was out $2,000 ($1,000 for the damaged goods and $1,000 for the replacement). With my small margins and low average order, this was big. Like, skimping on food for a couple months type of big. Even though it was just ~4% of my annual sales, with $1k in inventory and an additional $1k in liquid assets tied up, things were tough. But did you see me post on here begging for money, claiming I was going to go out of business? OF COURSE NOT. Anyone who runs an actual business understands the necessity for cash on hand or at least some type of "insurance" for the unforeseen inevitable. 
And claiming $1k (0.016% of annual sales) will put you out of business?! Is that how you build customer trust in your business? If I saw that I would do my best to stay away, as I would be worried if I bought an item and he lost *another* $1k, my money would be gone with his business. 
He's trying to use this to drum up sales but to be completely honest, from a marketing standpoint, he's as subtle and effective as a coked up baboon running a yoga center. His feeble attempt to strum at your heartstrings just turned into a shitshow where he openly admitted to either 1)squandering the millions he apparently made or 2)running his business so inefficiently that 0.01% of sales would destroy him. 
Either way, this is *not* the type of business I would want to give my money too.
