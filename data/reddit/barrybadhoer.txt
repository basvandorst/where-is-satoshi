I can imagine scenarios where block times lower then 10 minute could be helpfull and in that sense some blockchains outperform Bitcoin by at least a factor 10

I was looking for a place to quickly access both coins so I can dump my s2x but didn't coinbase still hold the bth from people that had their btc on coinbase? I would feel uneasy having my btc on there if they kept the forked coin away from the users last time.

i don't have a facebook profile and yet they still have a [shadow profile]( on me. that and tracking tools that almost every website uses. so i didn't willingly give my information to facebook but it still happens.

Disclaimer I'm generally on the real Bitcoin side (btc) and also I might get things wrong so please correct me if anyone reading this has better information.
Roger ver basicly created bitcoin cash because he had a different opinion on how bitcoin should scale, basicly every block mined has x amount of room for data (1mb? I think). Because of the relatively low size everyone and their mother could support the netwerk if you have so much as a raspberry pi. 
Roger ver said fuck that more is better and bitcoin cash has 8mb blocks I think with the reason being more mb = more transactions but this makes it harder for the general populus to support the network and benefits bigger players. Which in my mind undermines the very thing bitcoin stands for.
Right now the transaction fees lower for bitcoin cash but that's because the regular bitcoin [actually gets used](
Another reason I really don't like bitcoin cash is that Roger ver and the btc/bch subreddits have tried to pull a bait and switch where new people that want to buy BTC click on rogers website and would probably end up buying bitcoin cash thinking it was bitcoin. They still do btw. If you press the big "buy bitcoin" button the default is bitcoin cash. 
Tl;Dr BTC is the people's currency and BCH is Roger vers pet project
