Hey I didn't realize I was doing another dissertation. The buzzwords you see stem from much more complex talks, articles, and data that, if you really can't Google and need me to, I can find and put together for you. I didn't come here with my credentials trying to impress anybody, but I'm familiar with this technology - and while gold is physical and BTC is data,  they share economic functions and financial trajectory in the market, though Bitcoin exceeds gold in this way. Bitcoin is valued in a far more intricate but similar way philosophically. There's actually ZERO substance to your claim of "No, it isn't." You're really boring and unimaginative.

Gold increased in value even though industrialized and personal mining peaked long ago. It was accepted as a store of value and universal, as I believe Bitcoin has by many and will continue to be.

Search "Bitcoin social scalability", there's interesting info on how BTC still has advantages even while up against its mathamatical scalability.

That's nuts. I'm an iota man myself.

Bitcoin Futures will reasonably cause an acute swell and, after the shorts selling on a modest take, we could be riding some great waves to capitalize on short term, but ultimately I don't see how BTC as well as the strong altcoins will not eventually get massively valuable proportionally. It's literally where we are headed mathematically, all the FUD aside imo.  Fucking hodl.

It has far more similarities than differences, research proves this.
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:51:53
Oh thank you! See this is the one area I'm not familiar with, I read it thinking the issue was far more basic. Apologies to you OP!
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:02:13
Haha fucking clowns, man

I just read a story on tradeview about a man charged with kidnapping and robbery for putting a gun to a guys head for his ether.

Wow your response made realize that I used the wrong tense! "Increased" I meant. I completely agree with you! I was using gold as a historic example, but I do think that crypto will ultimately have better staying power, though in what precise form I don't know.

I always read comments about power consumption or hash rates, but can you tell me an estimate of the actual amount of BTC this pulls in over time?
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:05:25
Key phrase: This is FRAUD. Indeed, you are the one who will be defrauded.

It is during these quiet times that we ought to remember there is more happening then what we are shown in the media. It's interesting this is happening just as institutional attention has begun in the market. To hold onto your Bitcoin at this point prevents it's redistribution to those eating it up right now, who know that eventually it will take off like never before. It's up to you but I am optimistic.

If I buy one apple, and the price of apples goes up, does my Apple get bigger?

This is a robbery! Give me your upvote!

The original loss was about 65M at the time.

I forgot about that. To the wind.

I bought one Bitcoin in 2015 for something around 350. I gave it to my brother because I was homeless and needed to rent a room. He spent it immediately. It's funny where life takes you and the things you brush up against without knowing.

All I can tell you is that it has happened, I believe the two in particular that I talked to over Slack, and while it does seem objectively unlikely, it's not impossible just because those individuals didn't escalate the issue on Reddit themselves or tell a news outlet. Look I'm not anybody special or like an employee of some nano competitor. I myself, in my own little life, didn't have the inclination to run through the streets with this - I just spent a lot of time troubleshooting the individual cases with these guys and did research that interested me into the possibilities. My feelings are hurt and I'm going to have a Coke.
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:55:36
I TOLD YOU GUYS

I've been discussing this vulnerability for months on slack and discord channels. I've spoken with multiple people who have lost funds seemingly impossibly via their nano hardware wallets. I did some digging on Amazon sellers, companies who have contracts with Amazon to distribute the nanos. There is very little oversight on these secondary sellers. It is, as I have been trying to explain to people for a whle now, very probable that certain warehouse sellers are physically manipulating the hardware to extract seeds prior to shipping them. Incidentally, the packaging no longer has a particular seal that would indicate tampering, it was cited that the reason was that the nanos are impermeable anyway - but it's simply cost. Please beware when purchasing the Nano S. There may be no way of knowing beforehand who exactly is shipping your wallet. I've come across individuals deriding me on these forums saying that they aren't hackable and that I should stop spreading fear. Please. It's physical technology, if it exists, so does a weakness. Don't be too quick to think your security is "good enough".

That kind of blind tribalism is toxic. In 20 years can't imagine Bitcoin tech shoehorned in as the primary currency, up against other (unnamed) instant and feeless cryptos...

Absolutely, I just bought a new phone but I'll look through my photos on the old one - the conversations are from January so in the meantime I'll get back into slack and look for good examples of issues and losses people have had. I'm at work so bear with me.
Update: The one conversation I'm really hoping to find occurred in the iotatangle thread of Slack, but as I look at the forum now, the threads appear to have been changed? I don't recognize the current list of threads, so I'll have to wait till I can check my old phone for screenshots I took previously.

Boy, the impact isn't what it used to be, with these thirty second ads.

Looks like you can buy and sell, and referring to investing in a kiosk, you're asked to provide an Aussie dollar equivalent, so there's that as far as origin.
