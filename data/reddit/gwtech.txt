Actually there was another front page story on reddit today talking about a kid who bought 27$ worth of bitcoin that are now worth $800,000. It was  on the front page. I think THAT got a lot of people back into bitcoin.

That is significant.

First I dont think someone who could come up with the concept of bitcoin would necessarily need to be an expert in turing completness or what ethereum is doing NOW.   Its a whole new level of thinking that didnt exist before bitcoin was invented.
Lastly he didnt need to be a reclusive genius because he was shy. He would have been reclusive because he was scared  of taking on the banking world and of becoming known as being very wealthy. Becoming that kind of rich ruins your normal life forever.  Its something to be scared of.bit je could still be a very cocky confidient blow hard.
But over time he could have gotten more confident and pushed the incognito envelope more and more not brave enough to come forward but brave enough to drop hints so that event is triggered by someone else.  I suspect that is what happened and why he left clues and more hints as he saw bitcoin now has enough of an establishment that he felt it might protect him from whatever happens when he becomes known. 
@_date: 2015-12-09 04:18:59
He is saying he purposely attacked alt coin chains?  I think that frankly sucks if true.
@_date: 2015-12-09 04:16:23
That was my thought exactly.

Well dogecoin still has fairly stable value .
@_date: 2015-12-30 07:16:15
My understanding is if you have paper wallets today and bitcoin branches to regular and xt and unlimited that your  early stored coins will actually be good on all three branches.  Essentially a stock split if all three branches retain some value.
@_date: 2015-06-08 13:25:08
Of course that is possible.
But its benefits are undenialable.
It is money that can store immense amounts of wealth with no physical trace and no evidence of ownership thats needs to be carried on the person. It can cross borders with impunity.
Its accounting system that determines who holds what part of the wealth is not controlled by any government and, unless the whole bitcoin computer network is taken over by one government , it never can be controlled.
Those are IMMENSLY attractive characteristics desired by the same type of people and investment funds and  organizations and governments who like to put a portion of their wealth into gold. Therefore it is logical that more and more of them will consider it a  mainstream method of diversification.
And indeed that is exactly what is happening. 
And bitcoin price MUST rise as more and more money is put into it.
And bitcoin is BARELY invested now.
You are looking at a huge empty bucket storage which is barely wet that is being seen be more and more people who control floods of water coursing through gigantic rivers everyday.  It is going to get more and more filled simply because it is a cheap easy storage system for vast amounts of money.
I beleive we are going to wake one day maybe five or ten years from now and investment bankers will be talking about putting a portion of their funds in bitcoin for diversity just as they do stocks and bonds and real estate and gold now. It is at that point that there  will be hundreds of billions in bitcoin just as a small percentage of the worlds wealth. It wont even be news. It'll be just as boring as the discussion of whether Fidelity has more in stocks or bonds. And at that point bitcoins price will mathematically be forced over $100,000 per coin.
It is simply a matter of investment and investor slow steady penetration. And that comes naturally as adoption breeds more adoption. The more normal it becomes the more money will flow into it. Right now bitcoin  adoption is simply a continuing penetration over time exercise relating to money managers. Its not the average person I care about adopting it. They are an insignificant portion of the wealth of the world. Its the professional money managers who are slowly becoming more and more comfortable with this idea of digital assets and wealth storage. That process wont reverse. It can only get more extensive.
The only real counter to bitcoin as digital wealth storage is other digital coins. For example Dogecoin which started as a joke has actually retained immense strength and has some good reasons why it may continue to be the darling of the nerd world. Its value has rerisen dramatically lately.  So there is good reason to beleive that, just as wealth is stored in both gold AND silver , money managers may put a portion of their funds in Bitcoin AND Dogecoin and a few others. But even so that dilution is so relatively small and the total invested cap on ALL digicoins now is so small that it wouldnt change the huge rise that should take place as more money flows into digicurrency/digiwealth.

Turn on that website that makes a sound with every bitcoin sale.
What is that website? One turned out to be a virus site or something. Is there a safe one?

I do beleive the community will make any  needed correction like they have in the past.
@_date: 2015-06-08 05:22:06
Its gold 2.0 and that is a reasonable value if it adopts the same total cap value as gold does today.
Its not so much a target as a natural settling point if bitcoin attracts investment like gold does.

Yes but you could do the same thing by making a dated post with the lyrics and your name on pastebin or even reddit.
But you cant sue someone else for copyright infringement in the usa until you register the copyright officially .
Whst you posting could do however is prevent others from registering your lyrics as THEIR copyright because you would have public disclosed dated proof that you possesed those lyrics before someone wlelse tried to register he copyright and that is helpful in disputes.

Diversified wall street investors forced to sell assets to make margin calls on their stock losses?
Bitcoin is now more .ainstream that means it is SOMEWHAT tied in to those same wall street investors who buy a lot of stocks in short term margin call situations. I expect Bitcoin will bounce back ater those sellers have stopped.
@_date: 2015-05-12 10:51:39
Anything that makes large groups of money professionals take bitcoins and bitcoin longevity seriously means that eventually they will want to put some assets into bitcoin and that makes the price rise.
If bitcoin appears in any news article or internal newsletter from any established firm then it makes bitcoin go up in value long term.
Any news or action that increases the standard money manager asset allocation basket to include more bitcoin means bitcoin moves steadily toward its ultimate highest price valuation as gold 2.0 . That valuation equivalent is over $100,000 per bitcoin (total dollar value of all gold ounces today at spot price divided by  number of bitcoin = what a bitcoin would be worth if same amount of monetary wealth assets were invested in bitcoin as are invested in gold today)
If someone invented a new gemstone that could only be produced in limited quantities and it was better than diamond and was selling a less than 1000 th the price of diamond per carat today would it be a reasonable long term investment as it slowly was making way into the diamond trade?

Not even being funny or speculative.
The price is irrelevant to the reason I have some bitcoin. Those reasons dont change whether the price is $100 or $10,000 or $100,000.
Additonally regardless of finacial situation other than starvation i would not sell even to pay off debts becuas eit is likely the rate of appreciation of bitcoin is far greater than the internet on any debt you have.
If I was starving i would sell enough to eat because you cant experience appreciation in the future if you arent there.

what noises if any does the hardrive make?
if it is clicking then look up "freezing hard drive" on youtube. It (freeesing the drive inside a ziplock bag in your freezer for  hours) often will let you run it one more time to do a quick backup or search for a specific file until it warms up again.
The metal contracts and the heads separate from the platters so it can spin up again and read some data.
Try looking at the usb after booting your computer from a cdrom of linux 13 (not 14 becuase latest version has a bug making it hard to read other dirves of most types). DONT INSTAL LINUS. Just let the cdrom boot your computer form the cdrom and then use it to look at the usb after you plug it in.
Even if that doesn't work

buy what you can afford without going into debt or spending your food and rent money. keep some in other assets and some liquidity.
I am one of many who thinks the gyrations today are ripples on the toes of growth.
I won't even think it is NEAR a permanent rational level and stop buying until all the money managers are in and it is trading on major exchanges against silver and gold and before that happenes I expect it to be in the THOUSANDS of dollars in a few years.
No other investment has the potential to 100x or 10,000x value based on a real comparative rational analysis. Even if it doesn't the floor will be soft.
Also anyone buying a lottery ticket when bitcoin is around is just dumb. 
bitcoin has real chance for 100 to 100,000 your money  and is always going to have SOME value vs 1 in 1 billion chance of winning with a lottery and if you don't win the lottery you lose all invested.

A general comment simply doesn't help.
It clogs the replies and sometimes gets upvoted displacing real replies that answer what was asked and stopping the commentary.
If you are an expert in the legality of it then contribute specific compliance necessities. 
Are you in fact someone knowledgable about the specific legal compliance issues or just some one thinking they must be expensive?
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:41:59
Yes. 
Which is exactly why I am asking before I code.

RE: my complaint below
Charlie successfully resolved this and extra bitcoin (more than I paid for ) has appeared in my blockchain que.
well done bitinstant!
I love you again.
original complaint:
bitinstant/charlie 
just gave you a private message with all my missing order details I have (name bitcoin address etc. date amount )
bitinstant order was placed 4/6 . money was received by zipzap on 4/7  and confirmed by them via email.
I dont have order number becaase your website only shows last SUCCESSFUL transaction processed not our whole history (which isnt helpful) and the printout moneygram form doesn't retain that when you print it out. only ZIPZAP info. ( another problem in retrospect)
please look in your private messages not just postings here.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:15:31
