You chose to make your money by creating a digital image which if copied will cause your children to starve.

If I was in counterintelligence and I didn't want someone to know it I would misspell it.

You said a lot of qualifying words. You are less vulnerable with fiat.
@_date: 2014-03-19 17:01:47
I use fiat and I don't carry it all with me in a giant wad. I'm just pointing out that if feeding your children is dependent on no one ever copying one of your digital images then they will starve. I would rethink this strategy. Most people don't consider copying a digital file to be stealing and for good reason.
@_date: 2014-03-19 17:44:48
that's not the point. if your living is dependent on no one being douchey then you are going to have a bad time.

You can take a slightly above average woman and easily create his wife. I'm sure that was done.

I bought my first car by washing dishes. I literally paid for that car with labor. But I washed those dishes before I bought the car. And I also traded in those hours for fiat money. But really...the dealership took my dish washing labor as payment.

The dollar is pretty predictable. It will be worth slightly less each day. It's not volatile.

What you wrote actually contradicts your claim. Those seem like much better odds than bitcoin which offers none of those possible outcomes.

It's ironic that bitcoin people seem to be particularly gullible. This could easily be an "I go chop your dollar" situation. Even "legit" charities make off with a good percentage of the money. Oh well. As long as it relieves some people's guilt it has some value I guess but what's to feel guilty about anyway? As far as I can tell it wasn't bitcoin people harassing this guy anyway.

It's just powdered supplements which have recently been shown not to be particularly healthy and potentially unhealthy: 
Really, we have no idea if nutritionism:  is valid or not. I think not b/c we are always discovering new nutrients and there is likely synergy involved with nutrient absorption/use that can't be replicated.

Have no idea, just pointing out that it's simpler. Something shadier than mere incompetence is going on though.

By whom?
@_date: 2014-03-19 19:38:44
It doesn't matter what I or the cartoonist would rather anything be. The fact is that it's very difficult to make money off digital files and it's getting more difficult every second in an exponential way.
If I ran across a good cartoon I'd post the link in the original format from the original site and not repost just the image but that's b/c I'm lazy. If I ran across just the image on imgur I would post that. Again b/c I am lazy. It's not my job to research sources of material I randomly run across.
You have to adjust your goals to the reality of the situation. Digital files are not going to go up in value, only down. That cartoonist trying to guilt people isn't going to change that even if they agree with the basic principle.

Oh man, this shit just reeks worse and worse as time goes by. I will chop your bitcoin and then say I "lost" them at the nadir price that I fabricated only on my exchange.

Come on, you don't believe that image bullshit do you? I'm sure you think he's happily married to the same woman and never cheated. Look deeper into his biography. He's as much an image and PR man of late as he was an investor in the past.

I have no idea, just pointing out what they meant. It's probably an exaggeration.

Well, they actually live less than European dogs and this could largely be due to American dog diets being hardly any scraps (or none at all) and instead consisting of lower than human grade chow. I feed my dog almost all scraps and have some really high quality chow only as a supplement in between meals if they choose. It's not human grade for a reason, mostly b/c it's crap.

You can get conned more easily without regulation. Still, regulation doesn't make getting conned impossible and there's at least the possibility of restitution.

Everything that is being said about btc is almost identical to gold/silver 7 years ago among its devotees (of which I moderately was - though luckily I didn't have much money to play around with). I've heard all of this before. It's amusing but delusional.
Weak hands, if it becomes a currency and replaces the dollar it will be worth x, the market is being manipulated, we're part of a revolution, etc. All the same. What I realized is that I wasn't an investor at all, I was a believer, and beliefs preclude facts by definition. I see the world much clearer now and only believe in green. There will be another bubble and I will be in on it. I missed this one waiting for silver to go back up to its highs.

The basic idea is that the reason you're in a sense constantly reliving them now, that you have intrusive memories about past traumas, is that you repressed the primary emotions of the event at the time to get through it. This happens with PTSD. Your body/mind needed to get through it so it repressed the primary emotions, primarily b/c of intense fear. The reason why it keeps bothering you is that those original repressed emotions are like a river that has been damned. Emotions shouldn't be constant, provided that they are allowed to flow as freely as possible. In fact, it's quite a skill to learn to never repress and to fully feel whatever it is b/c if you can do so the emotions will actually have much less of an impact. You feel them completely, let them flow through fast and get them over with.
Now, this is just one model for how emotions work in PTSD situations but I've found it to always be true. Something in the brain, and I mean physically, has to be powering these intrusive memories. The brain could not be "designed" so that you constantly relive past traumas. The question is why is this occurring? E helped me a lot, along with talking with a very emotionally empathetic person. I remember crying over being spanked as a child (which was excessive) and I started to actually feel better over time. I was unconsciously clenching my jaw to hold in those emotions.
I'm not here to give advice on what you should do specifically. It's different for each person, the solution. The problem is very much the same as I've seen. Watch "My Strange Addiction" in TLC and you'll see this over and over. Something traumatic happens, they don't fully feel the emotions at the time and it's too scary to them to talk about it fully later, then they develop an "addiction" to something. Emotions that are being repressed cause a symptom. If you really search for a solution I believe you will find it. Some of the realizations may be the exact opposite of what you want to hear though.
@_date: 2015-02-11 16:15:25
You have to feel the emotions fully for those memories.
