It sounds like what you're saying is that these restrictions are being imposed at the card network level. If that's the case you should name and shame and let the community take on the task of remonstrating with the networks directly.

Sounds like however you sell whatever you sell, you're not afraid to muck about under the hood of your ecommerce software...
Why not do it Amazon style? When the customer hits your checkout and picks a payment option, calculate the savings for that order if it were to paid with Bitcoin and offer it (or a percentage of it) as a discount listed next to Bitcoin as an option:
* Visa
* Mastercard
* PayPal
* Bitcoin **SAVE $5.46 off you order today!**

We wish. While it may give a few people the nudge they finally need to move to a credit union, most will simply accept it after whinging about it for a bit.

While I admit that I'm not up on the current SI definition of a shitload, I'm pretty sure describing the population of the cryptocurrency community as one might be slightly premature. Especially in the eyes of a faceless corporate bank like Chase. You really think they give a shit if this costs them a few thousand accounts?

They were pretty open about it on their [blog](

You should try positing to the Bitcoin forum and seeing if other people using your currency want to trade.

Probably people trying to get out after reports of a possible compromise. I wish they'd wait a little longer. Dwolla's taking *forever* to add funds...
@_date: 2011-06-19 19:58:33
My recent (this past week) experience was 4-5 business day wait on Dwolla after the transaction posted to my checking account.
@_date: 2011-09-30 06:15:34
I have to agree that my credit union's site is pretty bare bones. They make up for it with a decent Android app and compatibility with Mint.
Of course we may be spoiled here in the Portland area. [First Tech]( sets a decent example.

The current protocol could be extended to allow more decimal places. The actual value wouldn't change,

No. How do you feel about [Namecoin](
@_date: 2011-06-22 16:07:05
Until MtGox releases exchange records, there's no way of knowing if the coins in question were "stolen" as in sold by a hacked account(s), or sold by others in the crash-panic.

It'd also be really really stupid to give a *"Financial Auditor"* access to the table with the auth info.

I think that 12 hour time might be for mtgox to imitate the xfer to Dwolla. Dwolla may take time on top of that. It took 2-3 business days for my USD from mtgox to show up in Dwolla, then another 2-3 business days to ACH into my Checking account.
@_date: 2011-06-08 22:10:49
Seeing as many of those people index against mtgox's prices, it probably just depends on your preferences.

No, it'd be more like bringing back the half-penny here in the US. Adding decimal places doesn't make a currency worth more, it just lets you split it into smaller bits.

I think powercow was referring to the recent suspected compromise when someone might have gotten a number of people's Lastpass (not the stored ones for other sites) passwords and Lastpass had to force a PW change for everybody just in case.

The only workaround I could see is is cutting a deal with a large pool to prioritize your transactions. Either way, miners get paid.
@_date: 2013-04-02 22:56:41
Traditional ATM's can take 30+ seconds to perform a transaction. It's not necessarily *that* bad. Besides, if they're getting all QR code happy with smartphones anyway, it may be possible to start the transaction before you arrive at the machine. 
@_date: 2013-02-26 15:05:35
A coordinated surprise shutdown? Mostly the same thing I'd imagine. It'd take longer to start coordinating a response, but if the pool operators I've met are anything to judge by, keeping them off the net for any length of time would be difficult.
There'd be a a lot of options. I wouldn't be surprised to see shell games involving namecoin and AWS or app engine. Eventually, the pools would probably just spin back up on I2P.

I doubt very much this thing would accept cards if it ever gets off the ground. The chargebacks would be insane.
It looks like all it'll do is sell you bitcoins for cash and buy them back for same.

It's not consistent with US corporates. It's a UK bank.

What's their ~~lack of~~ reasoning? Is PayPal claiming the goods weren't delivered, or that the transaction was fraudulent?

There's no reason not to buy in if you want to, provided you understand buy and sell orders and are willing to watch the rates obsessively.

Twitter is the address he tweeted a while back looking for BTC help.
@_date: 2013-07-12 17:39:18
Bitcoin will never support chargebacks. Some alternative may come along with that as a feature, and more power to them, but irreversibility is a feature of the protocol, not a bug.
That said, are chargebacks the only way to make buyers feel safe? You say finding reviews is a pain. Could that be improved? 
A certain popular and hidden site uses a web of trust to validate people. What if a DHT-based Web of Trust was built between buyers and sellers in the Bitcoin economy to make the review process more automatic?
What if people actually used escrow services for purchases?
@_date: 2013-11-04 19:40:05
And has been. Accusations of these sort of shenanigans have been thrown around by pool operators for about a year now.
The problem is that it's hard to consistently get very far ahead of the canonical blockchain before another pool completes and announces a block, which forces the 'selfish' pool to either discard all the work they did on their side chain and start from the new block, or immediately announce their block(s) and and let the network sort it out.
Whichever method the 'selfish' pool uses leaves telltale signs. In the former case, the pool can be observed taking longer than their hashpower would indicate to solve blocks. In the latter, network surveillance reveals patterns in the orphaned blocks with the blocks from the selfish pool being immediately followed by blocks from the same pool and with the transactions in the blocks always being older than would be expected from when the transactions entered the network.

If you really want to stay anonymous, LocalBitcoins may be your only alternative.
@_date: 2013-02-26 15:11:53
It's more a bet on hashing speed. If you (as a pool) get lucky and find a block in the first 1-2 minutes, you can bet nobody else will find it in the next minute or two and start searching for the best one. On a good day, you may be able to repeat the cycle for several blocks before another pool gets lucky and ruins your fun.

This differs from state to to state in the US, but in states where reimbursement is supposed to occur, it doesn't. Any server that tries to cash in on that deal will be promptly fired for *completely unrelated and non-trumped-up* reasons.

Bitcoin **is** a currency, but the Bitcoin network provides payment processing services just like PayPal.
@_date: 2013-02-25 20:19:45
Your scenario most likely fails in the first hour. Most of the major pools are watching each other closely and monitoring the shenanigans already taking place (Things like finding a block, but withholding it for a minute or two to get ahead on the next one).
The hypothetical NSA 51% attack gets spotted within the first 2-3 blocks. After quick consultation between the pool runners (15 to 30 minutes into the attack), they all email their users to immediately proxy their clients and blackhole the offending IPs. Exchanges rapidly follow suit, Twitter and Reddit blowup and memes get macro-ed.
Over the next few hours, a sizable chunk of the network responds and begins playing whack-a-mole with evil nodes trying to propagate fraudulent blocks into the network. 
Most of the users who don't respond fast enough get banned as potential NSA nodes and the network stabilizes. The forged blocks become orphaned and their transactions get pulled into new blocks. The bogus transactions fail and are discarded.
The pool operators, exchanges and users hit the forums and hash out a second "probational" blocklist banned people can get their nodes added to, to get back on the network via nodes that are setup to monitor incoming blocks for signs of tempering.
The planet - duly hacked, goes back to normal.

I'd argue PPCoin's proof of stake system for minting blocks is a better system than Bitcoin once all blocks are mined. Hopefully the Bitcoin network will consider adopting it in a few years.
