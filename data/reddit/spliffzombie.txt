I'm mainly in support of segwit because of second layer solutions, like sidechains on the bitcoin network. Do you think though after segwit btc will be able to compete with it's sister in fees?

That a nice way to put it, "buy some time." I am very excited for the second layer solution and what they'll be able to do. Guess I'll just hodl till then because unfortunately there are other coins better suited for money transfer atm.

There is a Bitcoin that works very well and has fees under a dollar!!! It follows sataoshi's original vision and works as well as Bitcoin did four years ago.

I wonder what will happen to all the paid shills on this sub when that happens.

lol BCH is not useless. I am a fan of satoshi's  original coin and use it now almost exclusively again. Because of btc' high confirmation time I switched to eth. But now I'm able to send my money for pennies again with BCH.

Bcash doesn't exist. Also btc and BCH are from the same chains and are sister coins. It amazing how anyone can view satoshi's coin, which works very well, as a Trojancoin, yet suck on cores dick while paying higher fees than what you're sending.
