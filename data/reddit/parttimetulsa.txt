I am so glad it worked out!
@_date: 2017-09-24 01:23:29
no fee. they sent 4 grand worth at the time of processing. the price has just dropped. I just want to know why the Kraken dashboard shows me a section that shows my bitcoins and under says total 4029 but the Bitcoins aren't worth that much. What does that total mean?

All I know is where other exchanges screwed me, Coinbase just worked. Use what works for you.

No USD. imgur took some of the quality away. Then why when I go to sell it doesn't offer me 4089?

I only use bitcoin to get gambling winnings faster. Well this is my first time cashing out my winnings. Buying a house and need down payment and closing. I'm right at the edge. Need to get all my money in one spot.

I am selling to retain the amount .Super scared about leaving 4 grand in an exchange waiting on them to rescan my id so my deposits stop failing. But don't want to risk losing money. Thanks.

NM I am looking in the wrong spot/...

Thanks. What software wallet do you recommend and what kind of fees am I looking at?
@_date: 2017-09-24 01:44:47
There are two boxes the real amount was tucked away to the right. Selling now to retain that amount. If Kraken doesnt scan my id Monday soI can start depositing then I will re buy coins and get it over to coin base. Having a super hard time getting kraken to get things done. coinbase I have to wait for the two deposits to verify my account.
If coinbase beats kraken then Ill start using it. this sucks stressing over getting money into my bank account. thanks for the help

Money is already pending in my account! 
@_date: 2017-09-24 01:50:20
I looked at the wrong box. I made $92 actually.

That's what I am asking. Do they not approve of gambling?
What is a mixer, what will it cost me?.. Why is this so complicated?
@_date: 2017-09-19 17:06:49
Youre cute
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:08:27
I don't sadly. I'm looking for a wallet now. I just hate the extra step and extra fees for legal gambling. I just want winnings in my bank account.. Thanks for the tip.
@_date: 2017-09-26 13:43:03
Taxes are a thing no matter what. I have to report the income anyway. I mean I could just stash away coins, but I am not in bitcoin to invest. I am in it to move legal gambling winnings into my bank account.
@_date: 2017-09-26 12:19:58
I am trying to buy btc not sell. Why would I be asking for money? I am giving my money for btc.
@_date: 2017-09-24 01:48:58
ok. I'll wait on Kraken. Kraken made me jump through a ton of hoops to get verified. Their form is buggy and they had me re submit 12 times. Then when they said it was ready to go my deposits failed. I contacted them and they finally got back and said the ocr software misread my id and they would manually scan it. Still waiting on a manual scan. 
It takes around 5 days for a wire to go through. I am not even at the stage where I am waiting on that... I need them to get my id scanned so I can request the deposit and get the clock started... 
We'll see if they scan it Monday. Thanks.

I ordered at the high price and it has dropped since.
