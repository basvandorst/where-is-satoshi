 aren't most fees percentage based? It's only $20-$25 on larger purchases, correct? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:57:05
Because someone can see the future and is trying to rip people off lol

Coinbase. Dropped down around 14k for about 90 sec.. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:15:54
BTC, ETH, and LTC ALL appear to be recovering. BCH still looks frozen. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:38:52
Just wait until whomever the insider whale was that pumped up BCH to move their money back to BTC now that they can sell high. ;) 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:24:22
Already did ;) got it right after 14k at ~15k

The only pros to using your checking account rather than your debit card are the slightly smaller fee and the higher limit. The con is the long wait time for the transaction to go through. Although, you can raise your debit limit through higher purchases. I use my debit card for small purchases and my checking account for larger purchases. Being that I only ever make small investments periodically, I've only used debit. It's nearly instantaneous from my experience.

I have some swampland in FL I'll sell you

Well, it's showing all the classic signs of a bubble. It's speculative, volatile, and has gone parabolic. Every time this has happened with an investment in the past, it's crashed and burned.  It's human nature to protect ourselves and by the transitive property, our investments as well. If a sell scare occurred, most people, including myself, would try to dump off our BTC before we're at a loss. If I'm already at a loss and it's too late for me to sell, i'd likely just HODL and hope it recovers. 
Here's one thing to keep you optimistic though: Every. Single. Day. There are comments about people saving up FIAT and waiting for the crash so they can buy low. Even if a crash happens, it will likely recover very quickly due to an influx in buying. Many corrections have already happened throughout BTC's history, and if we see another &gt;50% drop in value, I'm confident it will surpass the pre-crash value within the next year as it has every time before.

Funny you say that, because the reason tuition skyrocketed to begin with is subsidized loans. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:59:17
What if gains are reinvested? 
Ie. Short trading on highs and lows constantly. Someone technically made gains each time they've withdrawn at a value higher than they bought at. Even if it's put back into BTC, they STILL owe 40% of those gains at the end of the year, regardless of what currency it currently exists in. Correct?
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:22:05
Brilliant. Every time I dig a little deeper into the intricacies of BTC, I'm blown away by how much thought went into its creation. 
So, in layman's terms, I guess the reward for mining bitcoin will be so insignificant by the time it reaches its cap, that they just decided to cut it off there? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:29:44
Try later tonight. BCH is spiking high. There is too much volatility and anyone who bought in the last hour just tripled their investment. Be prepared for all that money to flow back into BTC while it's relatively low. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:17:28
I'm thinking people were trying to sell their BCH for a quick buck, so Coinbase "had lagging issues" in order to delay the inevitable. 
Edit: words
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:18:45
Either that, or BCH's blockchain crashed due to an overwhelming amount of traffic. The price is frozen so it's a possibility.

Kraken is a total mess rn. Sorry. Their CEO is now recommending clients use different companies. You may be SOL. Take a screen shot of your current investment and save any and all e-mails as evidence. If it gets any worse, you may have to join into a class action lawsuit. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:18:01
Yup. I'm on a construction crew that builds residential swimming pools. Weather, lack of work, etc.. I'll get a call soon enough to come back to work. Just have to find some side jobs for now. I'm just going to call it an "extended involuntary vacation." 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:48:20
Yup... that chart is insane! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:35:29
Price is heady
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:30:30
Avoid Kraken. They will be going under soon. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:28:50
So you keep track of your total gains and claim it at the end of the year? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:42:48
I'm not having any issues with Coinbase personally, but I def have seen some complaints regarding delayed verification. Even Kraken's CEO is recommending clients use different exchanges. It's looking a lot like Mt. Gox. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:56:01
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:40:34
You very well may get it back, but they are showing lots of problems. Many clients are talking lawsuits. A lot of people are pissed off. It's likely still there and you're just experiencing a delay, but they have proven to be unorganized and unprofessional. 
That's the big problem with online wallets. We don't actially hold the private key. I can't say for sure what's going to happen, but this whole ordeal with Kraken is looking a lot like My Gox. Best to protect yourself. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:04:36
On the charts at coinbase, it shows BCH at 8499.03 for the last 45 min.. it looks like a heart stopped. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:14:44
The whole purpose of cryptocurrency is keeping it decentralized. BCH seems to be a slap in the face of that idea.

The problem is how it's seemingly impossible to create a new ISP and be competitive in today's US market. Even Google failed. Too much red tape and too many mini monopolies created by (should be illegal) contracts between existing ISPs and local governments. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:51:59
Same. Maybe like 5 min tops

And my debit card was cancelled by my wife today due to what she thought was "fraudulent activity." Turns out I just got double charged by Home depot and they're refunding the money no problem. No fraud, but no card now :( No sale for me 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:28:33
Coinbase released it and people wanted to ride the wave and make a quick buck. Looks like there was an insider whale pumping it up since this morning too.. someone knew it was about to be released on coinbase and they dropped a huge investment.. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:21:19
I think out just put more faith in BTC as the king. Good ole reliable. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:30:25
I was wondering about this. Could one potentially make a profit by buying from one exchange and selling on another? I would imagine it would have to be at least several coins worth for the profit margin to overtake the fees and taxes. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:38:16
Same. Just got laid off too.. merry Christmas

Gains are to be reported as "extra income" to the IRS at the time you file your taxes. It's best to be honest about it, bc your bitcoin wallet is probably linked to your bank account. Your bank may report any information they see as "suspicious" to the IRS at any time without your knowledge. You only owe after you cash out your BTC to USD and only on "profits" you've made. Make sure to keep track of what you put in and what you take out.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:46:36
We'll get through it. Just like this layoff, the dip or correction or whatever you want to call it is temporary. Stocks predictably take a nose dive near the end of the year and rise like a phoenix mid January. Hodling. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:33:10
Is there a simple and inexpensive way to transfer from a Gemini acct to a hardware wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:43:47
It's half of the answer to THE question about everything. The other half is HODL. 
@_date: 2016-12-26 20:18:27
Yes. The only way to devalue it would be backing the USD with gold again. Their second option, and more likely scenario, would be to lobby for laws against it. I have a feeling this would just increase its value even more. I hope they go with option number 3, amd simply look at it as an opportunity to invest.

The housing market crashed 9 years ago.
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:47:50
It's never a guarantee... it could turn around tomorrow and start rising again. I don't see this as very likely, but if it was the case, everyone taking your advice would likely want your head. Never sell at the dip unless you fear that it will never rebound and totally collapse. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:02:38
"Classic bubble talking points..... they really don't understand..." I think you misunderstood his comment. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:45:30
The point of wise investing is to only buy what you are willing to lose. With this in mind, any person who invested "extra" money they had laying around definitely should have the financial security to continue hodling through this dip. If BTC somehow completely fails and disappears off the map, it was money they were willing to risk. 
Someone gambling with their life savings or their children's college tuition is the very opposite of investing wisely. It is the very opposite of investing only what you are willing to lose. Unless, of course, you care more about an iffy opportunity to get rich quick more than you care about your children.  
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:22:46
Came here for this specific comment. Thank you. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:42:34
Okay, gotcha.. So what you're saying in your initial post is: As transaction rates decline due to expensive pricing and less willingness to buy at higher cost, price/value declines as well? At least until there is a happy medium between price and transaction rate?
I guess it's safe to say that fear based sell off is exacerbating this drop too.
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:56:27
This would be a valid example only if you had the last ten bananas in the world.. it's the limit of supply that drives the price up. A random sale from a basket of bananas has no significance on the banana market if the supply is infinitely greater than the quantity in the basket.
