Nope, never used the term before. I presume you mean shanita10, who coincidentally used that expression when discussing Samourai Wallet and STONEWALL in another thread.

Yeah, that's what I figured. Thanks.
Is your contention, though, that: 
a) STONEWALL adds no transaction entropy. Or;
b) it does to some fairly neglible degree, but not enough to offer any real world privacy?

Do you have the link?

I've searched far and wide for Super Saiyan Blue levels of privacy and anonymity, but the subject is a veritable minefield.
Could I pick your brain on STONEWALL or similar decoy mixing implementations? Does it confer any tangible benefits, or is it mainly window dressing and wishful thinking?

It's a pretty serious accusation. I've learned not to trust anyone and always ask for the source so I can make up my mind for myself.
Don't trust. Always verify.

What card do you use? I wanted to get a debit card like TenX so I could buy stuff w/ BTC around Tokyo, but the powers that shouldn't be won't let me. TenX, Wirex and a bunch of other cards stopped working in or around Jan. of this year.

I see. In that case this feature is just window dressing, then.
EDIT: On a related tangent, do you think the Lightning Network can be used to achieve privacy? Or are there correlation attacks that render Sphynx Routing ineffective?

Hmm, this article oversimplifies a lot of crucial aspects. 
Centralized mixers are no good because they can steal your money and rat you out to whatever three-letter agency or tech conglomerate is out to get you. 
Even if it could be demonstrably proven the mixer can neither steal your BTC nor spy on its users, any given implementation is suceptible to Sybil attacks. There is also limited demand for this service from law-abiding citizens, so until Schnorr creates an incentive to use Coin Join, you're most likely getting tainted coins associated w/ criminal activity anyhow.

Users would be better off using Tumblebit as it protects against theft and information leakage. It can't protect against Sybil attacks, which is a shame, though.
