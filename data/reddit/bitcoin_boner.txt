.... I think you missed the point here buddy.  
Were not paying people to take bitcoins, were giving people an opurtunity to check bitcoins out without actually having to make an investment.  
My website gives people bitcoins for liking other peoples content, which gives them some bitcoins in return. I think you misinterpreted the website as paying people to take bitcoins rather than paying people bitcoins for doing a service.

All we need is for those big inverters to get scared... giving us time to build up infrastructure for BTC to be worth a lot more later. :D  
So yes, I really hope it scares everybody away... GIVE ME YOUR COINS   0_o

I linked to the page where you earn... the homepage is [Here](  
The point of the website is to give people bitcoins for boosting other peoples content... You can expect at least 1 penney payout per. That 1 penney payout is actually a really good deal for the person boosting too, so it's not just people clicking that benifit. Profits come out of the captcha the user (clicker) fills out along with the content that is getting boosted (payed up front by the person that wants their stuff boosted).  
To give an idea, that would be like 100 youtube likes for 1 dollar and thats without including the nickle that the captcha company pays people to do each captcha.

Downloading the block chain should take a day and a half in order to actually see your BTC show up under your "balance"... If I were you, I'd back up your wallet.dat file located in %appdata% in the bitcoin folder.  
Also, when your backing up your wallet.dat file, be sure to use a program like "truecrypt" to encrypt your file so nobody can steal it.

It sent it to your change wallet... Should just be your regular wallet if you are using an online wallet.

Ya but I was more excited about letting people know about the website while asking them what I should put on it for testing... Just more interesting that way.

This has been known for a while...

I'm not sure that it will... I've never seen anything before that would suggest so... Youtube, Facebook, ect. can't detect where exactly these ratings are coming from, only that it came from an iframe or through their api, ect.

Same with me... I will never sell my bitcoins back to dollars, but I will spend them for products sold in bitcoin. :D
