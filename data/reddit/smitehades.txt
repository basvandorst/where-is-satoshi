Did it jump 4k in a day?
To someone like me who knows zero about investing or crypto currency, it looks like people are just pumping in money to then cash out which would then crash the market in the end.
Bitcoin is clearly a bubble, and when it burst's the people who decided to wait because 'but what if it gets to Xk! I should wait!' are all going to commit suicide when they realize that the tens of thousands of dollars they originally put into bitcoin and were worth millions (total if they had a shit ton), are now worth a pittance. 
When it crashes (and it will) it will crash hard. 
Personally I rather be the guy that cashed out at 16k when I got in at 10k, even though it got to 20k. Than the guy that waited for 20k and it's now worth vastly less than what I paid for originally.
Maybe it's because I am a cautious person, but if someone like me can see that this shit is going to burst, it should be loud and clear to people that actually know about this stuff.
Besides, would you rather be the guy who lost 4k x amount of times, or the guy who had millions but now it's worth nothing.

I would not be surprised if people were trying to drum up excitement for it to make it grow bigger before they cash out.

Should probably sell now and make a profit instead of committing suicide when it bursts.

For someone with the wait and see attitude that is a not bad choice.
Lets them get a profit if they wait long enough, and if it tanks they can say they got out with no real losses.

One you do it will go up back to 10k, further fuelling your drive to commit suicide.

I am just advising caution.
People can do what they want though.
