Currently they don't. As of now there is overlap with the regular internet. There is a new tech on the horizon: 802.22. It's a newer standard for using unused analog TV spectrum for regional area broadband. Problem is those spectrum bands are in use by digital TV and aren't too useful in urban areas.

Speaking for myself, I don't use a bank because I thinks it's secure, but because of it's convenience of cashless transactions via debit cards and auto-deposits. However, since the bank makes paying people convenient, I want it to be secure and I want them to take responsibility for that security.
With BTC (or any altcoin) the need for a bank is erased. The problem is living without a bank is a little strange and confusing, and learning how to secure your own funds in a new environment that is totally different from current experience can be a little scary.

What would be sweet is if bitcoin had the ability to 'remove' coins from the system to be converted to cash. Anyone with a smart phone could scan the Qr on the bill to see that the note is legit. Later it could be 'imported' to your wallet and the bill would be worthless.

I feel your pain. My only other choice is Att, and hate them even more.

I was going to say that it wouldn't be that difficult, but now that I think about it, it is. While physical possession of that wallet isn't necessary to receive money, possession if the wallet and a trusted sending device are in order to send. Even with fiat, a debit card can be cloned with a hacked atm. But, one can rely on their bank in case of fraud. How would it be possible to implement the trusted sending device cheaply and durably without the need for a smartphone?
