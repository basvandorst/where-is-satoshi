A ***few*** random small payments? Do you have any idea the scope of how many sales these companies make off video games?
You really think it's a *few*?

Isn't this terrible? "China wants an 'orderly exit' from ***bitcoin*** mining"
So... converting all of those miners to ***Bitcoin Cash*** instead would probably sound like a great idea to them? :/

I love how just mentioning bcash got me downvoted. You got me, boys!

But, the lightning network won't fix that.
The lightning network won't hurt, but it won't fix your candy bar problem because the way it's being implemented is exactly the same way Bitcoin works now. So faster transactions, but nothing guaranteeing transaction sustainability.

Apparently a patch needs to be rolled out for all OSes and the one via Windows Update will supposedly cut performance of the CPU in certain applications by around ***30%***.

Thanks for explaining this to me. Everything else I posted in this context got downvoted into next week simply because I mentioned bcash so I started to worry no one would see it and I wouldn't get a legit answer. Holy shit the hivemind is real.

I'd argue the opposite, for a number of reasons.
- Doing things the way they're being done ***now*** debatably spammed the network. It brought damn near every crypto exchange to it's knees just a few weeks ago.
- A currency of the internet *should* have categories - if not for the infinite loop I mentioned above then imagine going to a store trying to buy a candy bar, but being told you had to wait 2 weeks so everyone else's Lambo payments could go through. That's how Bitcoin works now, without categories.
I might update this with some more examples in a bit.
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:02:29
Glad you agree with me.
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:37:43
Is it meant to be the currency of the internet? Or is it meant to be the next Gold?

Oh that's not good. Exchanged an altcoin for BTC, if the status remains unconfirmed I'd have to fight the exchange to get my money back. Hooray :/
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:14:34
Wait, how did you figure this out again? I'm new to the Bitcoin universe and I have a stuck transaction [here]( but have no clue how to even guess when it'll get unstuck :/
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:39:25
I would hope so, only it'll get worked out way after the market changed and my potential investment is gone. 
So not really, no.

Ok cool, I'll update the original post and add it to that but this is the tx in question: 
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:57:37
I'm still pretty new to this stuff, can somebody ELI5 what this means? ��
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:31:31
How tho? Wouldn't the money get returned to the exchange instead of me?
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:59:05
Can I post the blockchain link here? Or is there some kind of personal info tied to it (there isn't, right?)
@_date: 2018-09-02 20:35:14
It's ok, the massive shilling of lesser shitcoins is still welcome - according to the mod who banned me for calling them out on it. (y)

I think the more concerning part is the number of mobile apps linking to his website as a source of "reputable" information. 
Most of it is aggregated, but if I download a market checking app and it happens to have a news section (which a lot do), odds are the dot com is one of the sources - meaning it's not just Ver's dot com bullshit that's misleading people, but the majority of mobile apps as well.

You're right, the web archive confirms it and the replies to those tweets are an astoundingly perfect example of how deep the bcash brainwashing-rabbit hole goes.
Ironically, to this day there hasn't been one person I've seen on twitter who bashed Bitcoin and praised bcash that hasn't *coincidentally* had something to gain monetarily/behind closed doors from pulling the wool over the eyes of the crypto uninformed. 
But they wouldn't lie to us, right?

Do ***not*** use Shapeshift. Subreddit alone is filled to the brim with fraud accusations/failed transaction ticket numbers, has been for *months* on end and only held my money captive for 3 weeks causing the biggest missed trading opportunity in crypto history before eventually refunding me at what was unquestionably a much lesser value.
Do your research, all you need are two braincells.

It would be supporting coinbase though, wouldn't it? There are fees, plus it boosts their numbers because you need coinbase to use them. Plus donating directly to an address won't set off the streamers donation alerts, which is why I figured I'd ask about BTCPay.
@_date: 2018-07-22 14:04:37
That would be why I can't use it.
