My thoughts exactly. Why would I use these guys over the more established (and much cheaper) BitPay/Coinbase/GoCoin? 
@_date: 2014-02-15 06:56:43
Really cool! Any chance of shipping Australia..?

As an FYI, prices are generally cheaper on consumer electronics (including import costs) if you purchase from [CoinsForTech](

Nice! What store?
@_date: 2014-03-18 04:33:39
Always down for some healthy discussion :)
I'm not trying to spruik bitcoin as much as I am trying to explain the positives it has done for my business. Where exactly is my opportunity to scam them? They are welcome to buy/not buy bitcoin - it does not affect me. 
If they think I'm a scammer because I've listed why bitcoin is positive with proven real world examples.. well I don't think they're worth your time to be honest. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 22:57:32
Just following on from this- Overnight BitPay has confirmed they have identified both transactions and both should clear our bank in the next few days. They did not mention anything about their bank now allowing INTL transfers. 
Looking forward to getting some cash flow back!

Bitcoin has been used for legitimate purchases for a long time. Check out our order map on [this page]( and we are still a relatively small business.
A strong marketplace is needed though I'm afraid I can't understand the 5% commission on your end. Why are you charging a higher commission than eBay and why would I sell with you as opposed to CryptoThrift?

We are really lucky in Australia to have a service called Living Room of Satoshi that allows users to pay bills in bitcoin. 
I can eat out using my credit card and then pay the balance using bitcoin. It's less than ideal but still a good way to use btc for everyday purchases. 
@_date: 2014-02-05 02:54:50
Bitcoin favors small business more than it does large, though I believe the latter will help push adoption much faster. When you can spend your bitcoins at Amazon you can be guaranteed you will be able to spend them almost anywhere else you'd like. 
I say this as a small business owner who is competing directly with TigerDirect and Overstock :/ 
Edit: also wanted to note that its incredibly unlikely that most small businesses will keep 100% of their sales in BTC. That's the dream and it may well be possible in a few years, until we can pay our overheads in bitcoin though..

Private Internet Access has an outstanding reputation in the community.
If it's just unblocking websites my recommendation goes to [Hola]( It's a free Chrome plugin that works similarly to a VPN. I use it in Australia to unblock Netflix as well as anything else I want! 
@_date: 2014-12-07 23:29:35
We just launched something similar. You can see it at 
I truly believe an eBay style marketplace integrated with bitcoin integrated will be very powerful. We also run  which made it very clear that bitcoin and international trade are a match made in heaven, and a marketplace will only further facilitate this.

Eagerly awaiting an announcement. Once Gox tumbles the team should get together and write a book on how not to run a business

I seriously hope this is not true. We too have been having issues with $17K AUD sent on Friday that is yet to be received. We were told it was due to the snow storm in Atlanta. This does not explain another missing payment from the 5th of February however.
That said, up until this month BitPay have been excellent in both service and support and do not seem like the type of company to hide issues from their clients. It's worrying that CoinsForTech is not the only business affected though.  
edit: typo
update  (update 1 in comments below): All outstanding funds have been received. BitPay are back in my good books! 
@_date: 2014-03-18 21:48:21
We use BitPay to accept bitcoin. You'll see on [this page]( that they are compatible with a huge amount of shopping carts. It was as easy as installing a plugin and configuring our BitPay account. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 12:37:31
We've actually only had one package go missing. Ironically it was the Nexus 7 from [our December giveaway]( and it got lost in France. FedEx managed to bill him for VAT but did not deliver the product.. It was thankfully found in the end though it was a pretty painful process. 
If the package cannot be found it is insured up to it's declared amount. We ship with DHL, FedEx, TOLL or EMS for 99% of our range so this has not really been an issue. We use AirMail on video games if you're wondering what the other .1% is.

That's really strange. We use BitPay for payment processing and very rarely do payments come in late from Electrum. It's not unusual for payments from Coinbase and some other web based wallets to arrive late however.
The merchant will get an email stating a payment was received but came late. They will then need to contact BitPay and request it be credited to their account. You can also contact BitPay and request a refund (though if you are going to proceed with the purchase this would be the slower route).
Let me know if I can answer any questions for you as we deal with this a fair bit. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:37:01
I wrote this in another thread today regarding someone looking to add bitcoin payments to their store but it works here too.












@_date: 2014-01-21 13:01:33
Because they have overheads to pay. We keep only our profit in bitcoin and convert the rest instantly. I have no shame in that. It would be dumb for me to speculate with money I have to use for running my business.
I also think you are missing the point of bitcoin a little bit. It is early stages and almost everyone is buying to profit which I understand, but we are using it to efficiently process huge amounts of money for orders from a bunch of different countries. We are doing this on the cheap also. Isn't that what bitcoin is all about? 
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:49:59
Yep I'm getting it too! At least you're not involved in a bitcoin business! My family and uninformed friends think my world is crashing around me.

Nice! There has been one in Nimbin for some time though. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 07:26:59
If you pay after the invoice expires the merchant is still able to receive the funds. An email is sent saying funds were received late and requests you either contact BitPay to have the funds attributed to the order, or contact the customer to let them know BitPay has a refund waiting for them. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 03:17:52


Honestly, I think a large portion of our growth can be attributed to our products. Electronics and bitcoin fit together incredibly well. I’ve heard other vendors say similar things as you and as we've not done any strong marketing/advertising I’m afraid I don’t know how to help. We are looking at marketing and advertising avenues currently and I would be more than happy to share which are successful with you.  It’s tricky when your customers are so spread apart and when we are only interested in those in the BTC world. 


We redirect bitcoin customers to Coinbase at checkout solely to help with converting USD prices to BTC (not to sell the coins). I asked Coinbase recently whether they'll add a setting for merchants to enable a simple x% discount on all bitcoin orders and I'm waiting for a response. I hope they'll take the idea on board.
That’s great you are able to keep the coins! I do not think that it would be Coinbase that incorporates the discount but rather a plugin for your shopping cart software. I know that with Magento and WooCommerce you can set a discount for certain payment methods/other variables. This way if somebody chose to pay via PayPal they will be invoiced the full amount. If they choose to pay via Coinbase, your shopping cart will automatically adjust the price and send that info to Coinbase for the invoice. Quick, easy and automated!


We accept payments via BitPay. In a market like ours the majority of funds must be exchanged automatically. Our margins generally range from 3~10%. If we did not exchange the coins you can see how easy it would be for us to be in the negative. Even a relatively non-volatile 24hours could leave us with less money than we need to cover overheads. Essentially we keep the profit in BTC as that is mine and my partners money. We exchange the rest because otherwise we would be speculating on fiat costs that need to be paid. Not good for stress levels and not worth the risk! 
I've got no experience with Coinbase but cannot speak highly enough of BitPay. They handle all of the invoicing and payments incredibly efficiently for a grand total of $30/mo. To put that in perspective, we've saved over $2,000 this month compared to PayPal for a faster service with zero chargebacks.
EDIT: You are welcome to place an order if you'd like to see how it works. Please put 'test' in the order notes to stop our staff from contacting you re payment. 
Please ask as many questions as you’d like! The more merchants the merrier!

I did not mean for my comment to be insulting. It's just based on my previous experiences with eBay, which to be absolutely honest was limited with Israel.

Sorry I missed this!
Our profit is generally 3-10% on the fast moving products. You are right Australia is incredibly expensive for most electronics though computers and computer components are surprisingly cheap if you know where to look. The rest of our stock is sourced internationally. Very little stock is actually shipped from Australia due to high product and shipping costs. Asia was a much better fit for global trade.
Is it the sales figure or our service you don't trust? We've done a touch over $307,000USD of which $130,000 has been in 2014. Our average order is $978USD. In January we had 53 orders, in Feb 40 and in March we're up to 52. Here is a list of the country of origin for our orders in March. Not bad eh?
New Zealand

I too would like to know the answer to this. If it is true then I will be very disappointed as I am very interested in CoinKite hardware and could not find even a hint of this fee mentioned on their website.
It does not make sense for anyone to buy this hardware and use the exchange mode if that fee exists. It would be cheaper to set up your own in the long run.

Shipping time is no issue as our couriers are FedEx and DHL. The shipping cost itself is very reasonable as well. Less than $20 for 3-4 day shipping to Europe for a mobile phone or camera. 
You are right though that customs can be a pain, particularly in some parts of Europe. We can assist with the paperwork from our end but at the end of the day it would be much better for an alternative to come along that won't attract taxes on import.
 Honestly its only a matter of time (and we will have to lift our game!)

I run [CoinsForTech]( We are a global electronics store accepting only bitcoin as payment. We've been serving the community for almost 12 months. 
In March alone we've shipped to 15 countries.. If that's not a testament to bitcoin as an international payment tool I'm not sure what is. 
[Our TrustPilot]( in case you want to read some external reviews :)
@_date: 2014-03-10 01:10:01
I cannot put my word behind BitPay enough. We are currently using them to process a minimum of $15,000USD/week and honestly they make it a breeze.
Accepting bitcoin through BitPay has allowed us to process huge amounts of money between numerous countries at very little cost (not to mention almost zero risk). 
There was a perfect storm of events in February that caused our payment from BitPay to be about 2 weeks late. Other than that, the past 9 months with BitPay have been an absolute pleasure.
As an FYI, we are now active in many markets that most electronics resellers will not touch - these include India, Pakistan, Israel, Iran and some others. You would be crazy to ship to these countries if you accepted PayPal or credit card as they are very high-risk. **We have done a very significant figure in sales with a grand total of zero fraud.** Quite ironically we’ve had two attempts – both of which wanted to pay via credit card.
To sum it up – obvious market from lots of cashed up bitcoiners, very low entry and ongoing costs, almost zero risk, easy entry to some very tough markets (if you can support it) – what are you waiting for!

We decided to employ the same external review service as our non-bitcoin competition to try and bridge the gap between us and them. I also think that this will be better received by the non-bitcoin community. Imagine seeing bitcoin businesses with 100s of positive reviews alongside BHPhoto, Amazon and the other big boys. It would definitely instill confidence in me and I think also push interest in the bitcoin economy.
That said, I also do think your idea is a good one. Word of mouth is king in the bitcoin world and we do need to promote reputable businesses. If you do proceed please consider widgets similar to the [ones found on TrustPilot](
@_date: 2014-03-12 10:07:04
We've got a few regulars who sideways-spend their bitcoin. They replace the bitcoin as they spend it.

Yep I'm still here! The type of warranty is dependant on the product. Some will be covered by the local division of the manufacturer and others will need to be returned to us. This is confusing I'm aware so if you ever need clarity please contact us prior to purchasing. It all depends on the products origins. 
For example, computers, parts and components bought in the US can be repaired in the US. Same goes for these products in Australia. We should be able to source the OPPO though if it needs repairing it will need to travel to Hong Kong I'm afraid. Not keen on the [Vivo?](
As an FYI we've only had two warranty issues that I can think of. One was a Nexus 5 with a broken radio that we replaced with a new phone. The other was a PS4 in Denmark with the dreaded [disc drive issue]( Sony repaired this one locally.

As a high volume merchant I cannot recommend BitPay enough. [CoinsForTech]( has done over $60,000 to 15 separate countries so far in March without so much as a cent missed by BitPay. Our funds are received like clockwork. They literally take care of 100% of the invoicing and funds disbursement which allows me to focus on the business. Give [this thread]( a read as I gave a pretty thorough summary of what it's like as a bitcoin-only merchant. (SPOILER- it's awesome)
I've not tried Coinbase and doubt I will unless BitPay gives me a reason to move. They really do provide an excellent service for a store like ours. Let me know if you would like to know anything particular 
@_date: 2014-03-18 02:39:00
We hold profits in bitcoin and also pay our very few staff this way. It is a lot easier when you are paying people internationally. We've also just set up Live Chat on our website via Coinsecure. These guys are an incredibly professional support service who just so happen to be very passionate about bitcoin also - perfect for our store.
I replied to a similar question in another thread. I hope you don't mind me posting my response here


I also respectfully disagree that the 'point is lost' spending with merchants such as ourselves. It is early stages and almost everyone is buying to profit which I understand, but we are using it to efficiently process huge amounts of money for orders from a bunch of different countries. We are doing this on the cheap and using traditional infrastructure as little as possible. Isn't that what bitcoin is all about?

Our direct competition!! Honestly though it's hard to be upset at other businesses succeeding in the crypto world, let alone in Australia as well. A little bit of competition never hurt anyone ;)
I can also say the same about the total lack of fraud in accepting bitcoin. The only attempt we've had they asked if we'd accept credit card! 
@_date: 2014-03-18 04:22:51
The lack of fraud comes at the cost of consumer protection. By nature bitcoin transactions are irreversible. This means that you must absolutely trust the merchant you are purchasing from as they are in total control of the funds. For us this almost completely removes the risk of delivering internationally. Reputable vendor - no worries. 
The most common cases of fraud with electronics are chargebacks and stolen credentials (paypal/CC). The first is not possible with bitcoin and the second is much trickier. It's incredibly warming not to deal with this shit. Anyone who's ever sold on eBay or dealt with PayPal from a merchant perspective will tell you it's everywhere. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 13:02:17

It is the [Bitcoin Web of Trust]( which once upon a time was the heart of trading with BTC. It is a community based trust program.

I think anything that results in increased buyer confidence will be an excellent addition. 
We really had to fight for trust the first few months and new merchants will be no different. Rightfully so might I add given the permanent nature of bitcoin transactions. I am very much for any additions that can bridge the gap between legitimate new merchants and cautious customers.
@_date: 2014-09-12 02:39:37
They've got some catching up to do before they've serviced as many countries as us. CoinsForTech has now delivered to 56 countries with ZERO fiat transactions. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 01:44:09
As an online business owner myself I would very much recommend this option. We use BitPay and in general it has been flawless. Only this month we've had a couple of issues but it seems to be the CoinsForTech account only.
The largest positive to using a payment processor will be automation. If someone wants to purchase while you are asleep you do not want to keep them waiting. You'll pay $30/mo for unlimited processing via BitPay which is more than worth it for your stress levels alone. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 14:47:28

Until we can pay our overheads with bitcoin we unfortunately must exchange the very large majority for fiat at the time of sale. We keep only keep our profit in BTC and I cannot see this changing anytime soon. I would say that most merchants will do this, or at least those whose suppliers, landlords and employees won't accept BTC as payment.

We were reasonably early to the bitcoin party which helped exposure in the beginning. Up until now, we've grown almost entirely on word of mouth. We sent our first marketing email about a week ago and are now looking at some clever ways to promote our brand. 
If you'd like help accepting payments on your store I'd love to speak with you via PM. With services such as BitPay and Coinbase it's probably a lot easier than you'd imagine and you honestly have nothing to lose. Let me know! 
@_date: 2014-03-18 10:53:05
Great to hear you're joining the dark side! Do you mind I ask what your company does? Entering the space alone may get you off the ground. 
For the most part we've relied on word of mouth. The bitcoin community is super tight-knit and if you provide a good service people will talk/tell their friends. It was slow in the beginning but that was to be expected. Lots of scam accusations and not a lot of business.
The business growth is definitely not due to savvy marketing. In fact we probably should have focused our attention here earlier. So many in here have never heard of us but we've almost definitely delivered to their country! 
@_date: 2014-02-03 00:39:51
We have several repeat customers who purchase this way. They have created a decent amount of wealth from bitcoin and want to spend it, but do not want to part with their bitcoin. They buy bitcoin as they spend it and it works a treat. Essentially they use it as a payment method as well as for speculation.  
It works out much cheaper for someone to purchase from international stores (like ours) due to cheaper currency conversion. For domestic purchases I'm not so sure but you would still be actively pushing bitcoin adoption.  
EDIT: made a plugin for Electrum that does exactly this. You can see it in action [here.](

You wouldn't. We've only sold them across Europe and one to Asia to be honest. 
Essentially we've got one store for a whole lot of countries. We listed them knowing they likely wouldn't sell well in the US but would elsewhere.

Hi there! 
Sorry I completely missed your comment. We will definitely be selling the new Mac Pro though we're not taking preorders. Too messy for that amount of time with how quickly the value of bitcoin changes.
As soon as we've got stock to sell it will be online. Cheers!

No customers for us in Antarctica (yet). Check [the map]( though as we have delivered to some pretty remote countries.

Overstock did over $300m in sales between 2012-2013. They did $1M in bitcoin sales in their first two months of accepting it. It has taken us 9 months to get to 1/3rd of that level (and we were one of the very few early electronics merchants). I think our revenue is incredibly realistic, especially given we accept international orders while AFAIK Overstock does not for bitcoin. Looking at Overstocks pricing on phones and watches actually makes me think we should be doing considerably more sales.. 
[Here is our TrustPilot](
[Here is our BTCTalk thread]( - There are some reputable members discussing our service. This is where I first posted when the store launched and have continued to update since. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 05:36:40
Our stock is sourced and held outside of the US. Unfortunately this means for many items our cost price is higher than US retail. A prime example of this is our computers and computer components. 
We have looked at partnering with US based distributors, though this would have grave consequences for any customer not based in the the states. We pride ourselves on our INTL ability and would not want to shoot ourselves in the foot. In the future there may be a us.coinsfortech.com which is a step in the right direction (but an awful lot of work). 
Our prices on camera equipment, phones, watches and tablets should be very competitive with US pricing (excluding Apple). It's the computers and computer equipment that hurts the most.

Yep. The low fraud risk alone is worth a fortune in so many markets. Then when you combine all of the other benefits it really becomes clear that bitcoin is a winning idea. I can tell you first hand it has very positively impacted the way we do business and I'd say this would be true for a huge amount of other businesses. As each month passes it feels more and more like we are making history!

Yep! LTC should be active this week, otherwise it will be next. Doge we can accept with enough warning. The issue with Doge is that transactions must be manually processed. The majority of our orders happen overnight (Australian time) meaning we would not be able to accept it during this period.

There most certainly is. The United States plays a significant role in our sales but it would not be the end. We would definitely see a dramatic drop but as a BTC holder I wouldn't be too upset. If Amazon were to accept BTC it would be hugely positive for the community.
Our camera prices are better than Amazon US and we do provide a friendly/fast service. Hopefully this would allow us to retain some customers. 
We would still have our customers across Europe, the Middle East and Asia though.

Yeah it's been noted a few times with no response from CoinKite on any of them. The worst part is not being able to see this fee listed at all on their website or public documentation.. If the fee does exist, the fact they are trying to hide it at all costs does not paint a good picture of their morals.
I'm waiting for a response before passing judgement but given the question-dodging it does not look good.

That's strange. We use CoinURL at [CoinForTech.com]( and have nothing but praise for their service. They are our only form of advertising, and since upping our budget last week we've definitely seen a flow-through effect with sales and enquiries. 
I can also confirm that our traffic from CoinURL has a comparable bounce rate and session time to organic traffic. 
Edit- you could try anonymousads or bitads as an alternative
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:13:01
This is correct. Our overheads mean we can only keep our profit in bitcoin. Ironically we are currently using much inferior methods for transferring large sums of money overseas. One day wholesalers will catch onto bitcoin and boy will that shake things up. Anyone looking to make a fortune..?

Posting from my phone so apologies for the briefness. I'm a partner of CoinsForTech.com which is a bitcoin only store that has shipped to over 20 countries. BitPay has made our life incredibly easy. I find myself recommending them almost daily and if you do business with them you'll understand why. Great company with great employees. They also are integrated with QuickBooks which is a huge bonus.
Accepting bitcoin has a world of positives with very few negatives. It really is well worth it. Good luck!

Really cool idea! I hope you don't mind if I ask some questions. We've just launched our store so it would be great to see some insights into other Bitcoin-only businesses. 
How do you plan on growing your business? Primarily through word of mouth? Paid advertising also? Other routes?
Are most of your sales in the US?
Does your store receive a lot of traffic? What is the conversion rate?
Lastly, how did you gain your customers trust? As a new store were customers hesitant to purchase at first? This is currently our biggest setback 
edit: typo
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:24:02
I don't mean to offend you, but that's not a great way to run your business. At least we could not run our bitcoin business this way. You are banking on the price of bitcoin going up. If you did $5,000 worth of sales this week and the price dropped 30% I assume you would be in some trouble. 
Even though bitcoin has been relentlessly rising in price, I really advise rethinking your business plan. It would only take a spike in sales and a fall in the bitcoin price to do some serious damage. It may be worth mentioning that we think our business will spike significantly if (when?) the price corrects. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 11:58:01
You're assuming that all merchants have crazy huge margins. I also doubt that any established business is going to cut their profits in half to win over the bitcoin crowd.

Thank you for the feedback!
Here are the [shipping rates to New Zealand.]( Once your package reaches 3KG we would use EMS for shipping as DHL &amp; FedEx become very expensive. They are still a safe courier, it just would take an extra couple of days. Also IIRC New Zealand has a 15% GST on imports so be wary of that. You're on the wrong side of the ocean ;)
I also do legitimately think we are the  store for purchasing consumer electronics with bitcoin. We can't beat Bitcoinstore for computer parts and many (1,000,000+?) other products, but in terms of big brand consumer electronics, I believe our phones, tablets, cameras etc are the cheapest. 
We also definitely aren't shipping thousands of products, but we will be selling them. The store is not even close to full and our focus has been shifted to entering the market, but slowly we will keep expanding it.  I do agree that maybe it is a bit overzealous stating that our store has thousands of products as it stands, so I will make sure that is edited.

Being involved in a bitcoin business I can say that we are growing exponentially. This is partly due to the brand becoming better known and trusted, though we are no doubt seeing more people using bitcoin as a payment method rather than for speculation. Earlier this year it was tough to get enthusiasts to part with their BTC, but now this is not the case as some of our customers are enjoying their profits, while others are pushing bitcoin as a payment method and replacing the bitcoin they spend (replacing their BTC as they spend on goods/services). I will be looking for significantly higher growth than 25%. 
Don't just take my word for it though. Some of Bitcoins biggest players have had a wild year of growth.

Bitcoin Friday was our busiest weekend in our short history with nearly 45 BTC in sales. The majority of our BTC are instantly exchanged to fiat at the time of sale. Until we can pay our overheads in bitcoin this will not change unfortunately.
We keep all of our profits in bitcoin and will continue to do so. IMO, anyone that thought bitcoin was going to be a smooth ride to wealth was kidding themselves. It is incredibly disruptive to banks and government and Ive got no doubt that we will run into more backlash as bitcoin gains ground. I am a strong believer in the fundamentals of bitcoin and have been through worse crashes than this. Look long term and its just a small blip on the map

Hi guys,
We recently launched our store and are looking for some feedback. I have posted a great deal of information in [our service announcement on bitcointalk]( though of course I am more than happy to answer any queries here as well. 
Something we are very excited to offer is **fast international shipping.** Unlike many of our competitors, our shipping options are exceptional and are a cornerstone to our business model. Bitcoin was built to be used by people of all countries &amp; cities.  [CoinsForTech.com]( was built to serve these people. [You can see our shipping rates in USD here.](
We are hopeful that our service will allow consumers from across the globe to access technology at prices not found in their own countries. Our shipping partners are FedEx and DHL. Please note that if your customs are tough EMS may be used (Spain and parts of Eastern Europe among others we have needed to use EMS). If FedEx or DHL is used, once your package is shipped it will generally take 2-3 days to reach most countries. 
Please remember that these items will be imported, and as such you may be responsible for import duties / tax. Most of our products are duty free in the United States, and also in Australia up to $1000. If you are unsure if you will be charged tax or duty you may check here:

This is exactly how we run our business as well. Until our overheads can be paid in bitcoin we don't have a choice but to convert the majority to fiat.

Oh nice, what's your web site? If you'd like any advice or to ask questions feel free to send a PM.

We'd love to supply you guys with some electronics! Over 15 countries shipped to and counting at [CoinsForTech.com!](
Use the code 10off for the equivalent of $10USD off your order 
@_date: 2013-09-17 07:04:06
Good work guys. Get some natural peanut butter!! 
@_date: 2013-10-01 14:30:26
I've got no doubt that it will work, however you should confirm by comparing the supported network frequencies to those of your provider. 
You can find the supported frequencies under the specifications tab in the product listing. 
@_date: 2013-11-02 07:46:33
We at [CoinsForTech]( would love to participate
@_date: 2013-07-11 07:26:22
Thanks for your feedback!
We sell many phones that are compatible with the Verizon network, you'll just need to be sure the [network frequencies]( are the same as Verizons. This info can be found under the specifications tab in the product listing. You'll find most popular phones are compatible. 
All of our phones are unlocked also, meaning you can jump carriers once your plan is over!

Love seeing more business accept bitcoins down under! Really great looking site too!
@_date: 2013-07-11 01:35:58
This is a scam that was discussed here yesterday (I can't find the link). DO NOT CLICK
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:26:10
Over $100K in sales with 0 cases of fraud for us so far. Not to mention the super low transaction fees. The sooner you can afford to remove fiat the better! 
@_date: 2013-08-07 06:31:30
If you're in the market for electronics don't forget to check out 
We're not in the bay area but can get our products there in approx 2 days once shipped
@_date: 2013-09-16 06:38:30
Awesome! Now bring one to Brisbane! 
@_date: 2013-09-12 23:24:02
We've got the electronics side of things covered at [CoinsForTech.com]( Prices are generally cheaper than or on par with Amazon US (plus we offer worldwide shipping!)
@_date: 2013-07-16 23:22:56
Don't forget us!  
@_date: 2013-11-27 05:10:55
Are you able to sign up for the $30/mo BitPay service that does not have any transaction fees? 
@_date: 2013-11-12 07:24:12
I can see bitcoin rising a lot higher than that in the not too distant future. Of those on this list, which do you think has the biggest potential for growth? 
@_date: 2013-09-03 00:56:25
Thank you for the feedback! As a partner of [CoinsForTech.com]( it is really great to see some reviews of our service.
If anyone has questions please let me know.
You can read more about our business in our [bitcointalk service announcement](

Nice, even as a merchant I think that we are flooding this sub far too much. This was tried earlier with and didn't really take off. Having said this, we have many, many more merchants now. Will post our store now and best of luck! 
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:55:47
Awesome! A reputable directory not covered in ads/paid services will be a great boost for the merchants. Looks awesome and will be my second stop after CoinMap if I want to do some shopping.  A lot of non-profits I was unaware of also 
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:47:53
Depends what your definition of high-end is.. They all seem to be OEM models/clones straight out of mainland China.
@_date: 2013-10-18 23:26:28
Electrum for a wallet that even babies could use. Armory for something more secure
Cold storage if you're carrying a decent amount of btc 
@_date: 2013-10-05 05:07:12
Sorry I completely missed your comment. Unfortunately we can't source a lot of Apple products close to their American RRP. They are cheaper than most other countries though :) 
@_date: 2013-10-22 21:18:59
Plenty of electronics at [CoinsForTech.com](
@_date: 2013-10-01 23:11:00
It's not uncommon for Samsung to honor warranties on our products in local countries, though of course you definitely should not rely on this. Worst case scenario would be shipping the phone to us in HK and we will have Samsung repair it under warranty. This would cost the customer approx $30USD in shipping fees to HK. We will cover return costs.
We are able to dispatch these phones within 24 hours meaning our orders last night will likely arrive tomorrow or Friday. It's also worth noting that Canadian RRP seems to be $799USD which is more expensive than us (and I can only assume they won't accept your bitcoins)
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:30:26
FedEx/DHL will charge you on import. EMS will most likely charge you on import. 
@_date: 2013-09-16 11:46:08
Actually there is one this week! Beers and Bitcoins this Thursday at The Villager Hotel. Will be great to see who in the community is involved with bitcoin.
[details here](
@_date: 2013-10-02 00:39:46
I wish I could make that claim! There are other companies that will import them for sale in the US. As far as I'm aware we are the only company accepting bitcoin that will do so. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:07:53
Sorry to say that this is unlikely to change in the short term. Our wholesale cost is unfortunately above Google's price in the US. Once they are less in-demand the price will come down but that won't be until at least January (we can't even find a reliable source for the 32GB model)
@_date: 2013-07-20 02:11:20
Bingo! Sorry was half asleep when I commented. Good luck with your search!
@_date: 2013-09-03 01:16:19
I've sent you a PM. It depends entirely on your country of residence, however if you are in Germany it is likely you will need to pay some form of tax. 
@_date: 2013-08-10 02:26:35
I've donated to the EFF and paid for advertising with CoinURL using bitcoins. Both were incredibly pain free and I would say easier than using a credit card.
If you're looking for electronics be sure to checkout  We are a relatively new store, but have seen a great first month and are incredibly excited about the future
@_date: 2013-08-10 07:38:40
Nah bud its a pretty popular theme if you haven't already noticed. Its a shame you need to point it out every time we're mentioned. Talking down on your competitors is not a good look 
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:40:46
Can confirm that it's much like this in Kong Kong. Small groups of very passionate users + some speculators. No strong usage as a currency for purchasing yet.
@_date: 2013-07-06 23:17:25
I would be very cautious about putting your product prices in BTC. It will leave you incredibly vulnerable to market movement, and could mean you are updating your prices every hour (which could be hell depending on how many products you stock)
Most bitcoin merchants will allow you to set your price in USD and it will automatically change it to BTC at the checkout. This means that you don't run the risk of losing money if the market crashes overnight.
We are currently using BitPay on our store ( and have nothing but praise for it. 
@_date: 2013-09-13 00:05:44
Have you considered [Vapor Station?]( I've had no experience with them but remember a post of theirs on reddit not too long ago.
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:50:15
Well bitcointalk is down again but if you'll ship to Australia I will be entering :)
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:53:55
Thank you so much for posting this! You were an absolute pleasure to deal with and I hope we do business again:)
All the best. 
@_date: 2013-10-15 21:10:05
We've got a great range of consumer electronics at [CoinsForTech.com](
I believe we've also got the best and most affordable shipping services. Products are shipped via FedEx International Priority meaning your order will generally arrive 24-36 hours after being dispatched. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:10:42
How about a new [MacBook?]( Or a new [DSLR?](
@_date: 2013-12-01 01:03:50
Honestly we were planning on stopping about 12 hours ago.. Reception from the community has been really good so we've kept it going a while. Small price to pay to gain some new happy customers :)
Having said this, it is hurting a bit and we can't keep it going forever. If you do miss out please send me a PM.
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:59:20
We've had our busiest weekend so far but I think that was to be expected. In the past 48 hours we've received orders from 12 different countries; each of which paid using a single currency. Your move fiat..
My personal purchasing has included a donation to Seans Outpost, Reddit Gold and some love to my good friends at NameCheap! 
@_date: 2013-10-11 23:08:31
What benefits do you have over BitPay?
@_date: 2013-09-06 23:26:37
This is the issue we've been having with much of Europe. There are a couple of steps we can do to mitigate the VAT, however at the end of the day our prices are still unlikely to be competitive with your local retailer.
Thank you for the kind words also. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:54:31
Are you after a Hero3 or Hero3+?
Hero3 is becoming difficult to source because the Hero3+ was released.
Hero 3+ is difficult to source because they're so popular!
Once you reply I'll get onto our suppliers to see if we can sort anything out for you. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 10:35:52
Awesome, thanks!
