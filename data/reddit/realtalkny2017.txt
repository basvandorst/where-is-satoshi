Cool story bro. Communism sucks. I'm East Asian. All East Asian countries are safe as hell, even the crappy communist ones. Go to the non tourist parts of Cuba or maybe walk around Caracas (not communist but close) at night, and then write in your diary about the beauty of communism. You're a white guy who just took some college classes and like expanded your mind about how time is a social construct and capitalism is theft. They were only nice to you in Vietnam because you are white.

Nice explanation. But I definitely don't agree that it's like - does ny use Bitcoin? So totally different. The only people that have access to good computers and the internet in NK are the few communist elite. Not like ny at all lol. In ny almost everyone has a computer and access to the internet.
