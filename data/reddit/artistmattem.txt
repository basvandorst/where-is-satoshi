This is the best response ive ever seen from a customer representative. I am withdrawing a small amount today to cold storage and all my concerns have vanished.

A few thoughts after reading your post and the comments from others and yourself. 
In one post you say bitcoin is a store of value. But you also say you have 0.1btc because you don’t want to invest a lot. If you believed bitcoin was an actual store of value, you would feel comfortable putting as much money as you would be normally saving into bitcoin. 
Also, you said you’ve been trading for 2 years now and feel yourself an experienced trader. How many hours a day do you trade? What indicators do you use? Are you a long term or short term trader? If you really felt you were an expect with a winning strategy, you should sell it for bitcoin. Don’t risk losing your bitcoin trading. Gain bitcoin by tricking others into buying whatever method you have. 
Just based on your diction and sentence structure, I can tell you’re young. Maybe a few years younger than me. Keep your head down and stack sats. Don’t let anyone know how much you have and if people ask, be vague. Don’t make yourself a target. Good luck.

Start with epicenter episode 304 The Forefather of Cryptocurrencies and the Cypherpunk Movement. He talks about writing a paper that had the precursors for making bitcoin. The paper could only be checked out of a library. Look at who checked out the paper and youll find your next lead.

if this is your first time buying bitcoin, i recommend you stay humble

Good for bitcoin, bakkt, and the people who buy on bakkt. They could reck retail who chase or sell early

either is fine. Order directly from the trezor website.

The trezor wasn't but i took a picture of the seed phrase with a phone. It was never uploaded to cloud and has since been deleted, but since then i have learned you shouldn't do that

Depending on your time preference. You can chose to buy and hold for long term. You can trade it daily and weekly and try to make profits. You can buy it and send money internationally to friends and family within hours. You can use it to buy certain things like beers and dance classes from places that are on the boat. It just depends on what you want.

If you can adequately tell me the difference between the impact of direct spending and sale to fiat for spending, I will forgive you of your rudeness. Where do you spend bitcoin directly?
@_date: 2019-12-04 14:35:02
Send me your bitcoin address as well
@_date: 2019-12-05 17:11:08
If you sign up with crypto.com, they’ll send you a debit card and you can spend your crypto anywhere that accepts visa. Let me know if you want a ref link
@_date: 2019-12-04 15:28:04
okay, i wont send you anything
@_date: 2019-12-03 16:44:05
I had that feeling too, but then I remembered lighting network is OP. Right now you can send 1000 Satoshis, which is 10 cents, practically for free. And ideally, we want it to be scarce so it retains its value. Any dilution could flow into LTC and that would be amazing as well. Crypto future looks bright af

What do you mean bitcoin wallets? The wallets exist wherever you want them to exist. Hardware wallets can be destroyed and replaced. The seeds/private key is the only thing that matters. And depending on what you use and where you store things, it's a lot more secure than storing cash in a safe or on your person. Just as decentralization is a big thing in the industry, so is my distribution of wealth. Its all over the place in small parts and can be put together and moved in an instant. Andreas Antonopolous has a variety of good videos on seed and private key storage.

@_date: 2019-12-03 02:50:15
Bitcoin was programmed to be anti inflationary. If people could keep printing more, bitcoin would not have the value it does. Additionally, bitcoin is divisible so regardless of the number of whole bitcoin, the number of satoshis can be valuable independently

Get your bitcoin off any exchanges. Listen to Andreas Antonopolous, Trace Mayer, Anthony Pomplino and Mark Yusko whenever you feel weak. Don't trade altcoins unless you know what youre doing and youve seen watched in real time several boom and bust cycles. Ignore the haters.

thats not inflation, thats flow. And since the max number and flow have been defined since the beginning, the price will not be  affected negatively by flow. Inflation is when stock is added and dilutes the value by increasing the max number.
@_date: 2019-12-06 01:50:55

How old are you? I don’t think you understand banking or commerce at all.
I am a business owner that accepts bitcoin and I have customers that trade and hold bitcoin, but they have never paid with bitcoin. Right now is not the time to be paying with bitcoin. Especially with the Mayer multiple this low. Also most people don’t earn bitcoin so the incentive to spend is low because they have to rebuy it.

I am only waiting for an alt pump then pulling bitcoin out. Otherwise I feel its not worth the risk
@_date: 2019-09-14 23:03:41
why don't you pull out a crypto loan and use the BTC as collateral so you don't have to sell it until the price increases?
