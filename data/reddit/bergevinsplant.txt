I'm no longer up voting anything about or against BCash, and I think others here should do the same.
I'm open to the possibility that another crypto will steal the mantle from Bitcoin. Maybe a great team of developers can improve on the original idea, and crack fast, scalable payments.
I'm not open to the possibility that it will be BCash. It's just Bitcoin with 8mb blocks, poor leadership, and weak development.
If we ignore them they don't have a soundboard. BCH is boring, even if you want bigger blocks. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 13:47:59

This may seem like a counter to my last point, but I actually enjoy that sub. I find the shilling kind of funny, because it's a look into what would happen if the inmates could run the prison. No banks, regulators, etc. mean that people will act irresponsibly to promote their own self interests.
I'm more annoyed by two types of people outside of reddit:
1: People who now need to put blockchain expert in their LinkedIn profile - you're not an expert, and probably can't even code (not that I can). If you can't make a blockchain, you can't be an expert on the topic.
2: People who say 'Bitcoin is a bubble, will fail, is dumb... but blockchain is revolutionary'. That's the quickest way you can tell me that you don't understand Bitcoin or blockchain. If you aren't going to use a distributed ledger for money, what are you going to use it for?
I've had people tell me that they think banks will benefit from blockchain. Fucking how? They are a centralized organization, they can centralize their data.

With how much buzz altcoins are getting I've almost forgotten about Roger and Bcash.
There is no real argument that BCash is the best coin. Some alts have interesting value propositions, and I can see compelling cases why they might take over (though I don't share their beliefs), but there isn't a single person that can honestly say BCash has the best shot of usurping the world economy.
It's just Bitcoin with bigger blocks and shittier development.

I'm not against a block size increase. I think SegWit adoption is more important, but if LN and other solutions don't come sooner I think a block increase could temporarily help.
I see the block size increase kind of like the debt ceiling though. Once you raise it, that's now your go to when you have transaction fee issues. If nothing better comes it will be the only choice, but I think we can wait a little bit longer.

I like Jim Cramer, but he looks like a goof here. Recuse yourself if you don't have a clue what you're talking about
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:30:41
No problem man.
One of the biggest barriers to Bitcoin currently is that people feel they have 'missed the boat' because they cannot afford an entire Bitcoin. 
If they only see $16k USD or whatever the price goes to they will feel like it's too late to get in. That number is large, and deterring from a purely psychological standpoint.
If the masses realized that they can buy fractions of a Bitcoin then there would be more new participants into the space, which is good for everyone. If we display smaller units of measurement, they will realize this quite quickly.
This shouldn't be necessary, but even Jim Cramer and the panel CNBC had on this week weren't sure if they could own less than 1 BTC. Education is not coming from traditional sources, so it will have to come from communities like r/bitcoin.
For the record, the units of measurement were from previous posts asking to display different units of measurement for Bitcoin. I personally don't think that the unit matters as long as it breaks the price down to a smaller number to appeal to the uninformed masses. 
I also personally think that Bitcoin should be compared to $1 USD, because it's an easy conversion to a spendable amount of the world's reserve currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:56:42
Yeah and that's fine, they have the right to do their own thing if they want. I will never support anyone that uses malicious tactics like the Bcash cohort has, however.
The thing most people don't seem to get is that good development takes time, and this is still such an early market. Everyone wants scaling solutions yesterday, but that's not possible or the best route. Bitcoin *is* a bubble in the sense that the network is valued at what it could be, not what it is now. That bubble doesn't necessarily need to pop if scaling solutions that genuinely work get here eventually, but it will pop if there are issues like S2X or DAO. The MSM and casual supporters are just waiting for a catastrophe like that to pull out and write off Bitcoin forever. 
The higher it climbs the more precarious the position. Lay a strong foundation and you have something to build on forever. Use temporary fixes or poorly thought out alternatives and you might not get the chance to accomplish the ultimate goal of the project.

I've thought that the Washington Post produced great journalism for some time. It's amazing how every mainstream person or network is throwing the towel in on Bitcoin.

I don't mean world currency as in the whole world mainly uses Bitcoin, just that many people have chosen to use it. I should have worded the previous comment better.

@_date: 2017-12-08 15:48:53
This reads like it's speaking to institutions right now, moreso than individuals. If you run a financial institution (exchange) which they define as:


Then you are mandated to not allow the anonymous purchase of digital currency. As a holder, it doesn't seem to by implying that you have to disclose your wallet addresses to the government and register them to you *yet*.
That was a big part of the Patriot Act though, that the US gov didn't want anonymous bank accounts or bank accounts given to people who were not US residents. I had to open one as a foreign national in the past, and they made me give my passport + proof of address.
You have to guess they would like to get to that point again, but this bill *may* fall short due to it's broad nature.

The BCH pump won't last. Coinbase can likely only keep this up as long as they are in 'post only'. As soon as they allow selling the long-time Bitcoiners who just received their BCH will sell. 
We see an opportunity to sell BCH high and buy BTC low. Many will take advantage of that.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:18:10
These posts are literally fucked. 
Everyone knows transactions cost a lot. Everyone knows the technology is not capable of processing transactions quickly right now.
There are technologies that are aiming to fix these problems - and everyone knows this. 
Instead of complaining about fees to use Bitcoin as cash (which it is not currently capable of), why don't we discuss the potential ways to fix those issues? Complaining without a solution is just complaining.

Your transactions will be significantly cheaper because they are off chain
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:25:29
I respect that you are discussing transaction fees without just complaining. Whether you agree with this guys idea or not, this is exactly the way it should be laid out.
With that said, average on-chain transaction is about $15k USD right now (maybe someone can verify, I can't find a source right now). A $20 fee is negligible at the moment for that size.
I'm not completely against a block size increase, but the real issue is what users are trying to do with Bitcoin, not the network. It is not currently able to process small transactions quickly or effectively. This should be a deterrent to small transactions, but it's just caused more people to complain about 'high fees'. If you were transacting a worthwhile amount of BTC, this would not bother you.
This issue can be temporarily solved in a couple of ways: 
1: Yes, maybe a block size increase can temporarily ease some of the transaction pain we have currently. 
2: Use bitcoin for what it is *currently* intended for, and don't complain when you can't move $10 cheaply. We all know it's not feasible, so stop complaining about it.
As a third point, push Coinbase et all to implement SegWit wallets. We have a solution to lower tx fees and the major providers have not implemented it. This is such an obvious move. There should be constant pressure on them to make the user experience better, and SegWit is the first part of this.

So what is your solution you would like to discuss? Or is this just you complaining?
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:05:51
Agree with this 100%. If your wire is taking long then that's a bank issue. If the exchange is taking long then that's an issue with the exchange.
Many people accuse the exchanges of scamming them, when in fact they are just busy. I've used exchanges that are much quicker but I pay more. If you want the cheapest rate then you will get shittier customer service.

I would love to see Lloyd Blankfein say something positive about Bitcoin. He's seemed to be really thoughtful in his responses so far. 
It would be interesting to see GS come out for Bitcoin and then see what the JPM response is. 
We could all be wrong and this thing could go to zero, but each day it doesn't that chance becomes smaller. When Bitcoin has real sustainable utility it will be interesting to see what the detractors say then. The arguments are getting thin.

I will use Bcash as long as Bitcoin.com lists Bcash as Bitcoin. I will stop being derogatory towards the BCash brand when they stop trying to co-opt the Bitcoin brand.
That aside, the community can decide to support a chain not run by core anytime they want. They have decided to trust core because they like most of the decisions that team has made, and respect their ability to code. If S2X had gained approval and not failed then that would be the real Bitcoin - no questions asked. So they are centralized in the fact that they are democratically selected by the community I suppose.
Ultimately your beef seems to be with core, but if the community wants to support a different coin they will. They are not firmly put in their place.

I interpreted it the same as you, that no 'institution' can allow/facilitate the anonymous purchase of digital assets (crypto). 
'Redeemer' is a broad term, but it doesn't look like in this context it means 'a person redeeming crypto for fiat etc'.
This bill *could* eventually lead to that, but to get into hypotheticals I don't think that would be the end of the world. It's unlikely every other country takes the same hard line that the US does. 
I may think differently, but I don't personally care if my purchases are known by my government. It's important for them to be able to tax transactions, which I understand why they want to do that. Even in this new 'known purchaser' world of Bitcoin it would still stop the government from inflating currency, and take some power away from the banks. That's not the utopia many on r/bitcoin dream of, but I don't think it's as bad as some may make it seem.

Even a broken clock is right twice a day.

I couldn't disagree with this statement any more. 
Bitcoin will crash again when the casual buyers right now hoping to 10x their money realize it won't have that kind of upward momentum forever... and then it will rebound when it gains more usability.
The community is strong enough and not *completely* price conscious with their "investments". Many of us know that there will be solutions to help make Bitcoin scale, and when they come out they have the potential to be a gamechanger. It might not be instant, but Bitcoin is a technology - therefore it can be upgraded and molded into a better technology.
Why would there be a time constraint on it becoming more useful with lower transaction fees? 
There is no competition other than altcoins in this market, and if Bitcoin doesn't crack the puzzle then one of them will. 
Your statement is not against Bitcoin, it implies that technological innovation won't matter if it doesn't happen quick enough. That's absurd.

That's a good point. If fees keep bothering users then solutions will come to fix that pain.
Sucks LN is basically coded by one guy instead of a team, but LN could prove out that second layer Bitcoin solutions are profitable. That might become a template for future developers trying to help the ecosystem
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:43:49
That's great, and I agree with you completely. 
Part two of that is instead of *just* complaining about tx fees, let's push harder for Coinbase to adopt SegWit and do everything we can do encourage development for things like LN.
Educating the masses that tx fees won't always be this high is important as well. That this is merely a growing pain. If all they hear is that it's bad and not getting better then they won't stick around.
If people think they have a broken solution, they won't stay. If they think they are part of an incomplete technological revolution they will get on board for the long run.

We could just use multiple values like gold does. They have price per gram, ounce, and kilogram. 
We can do price per Bitcoin, mBTC, and µBTC. It's the best of both worlds.
We get to show how much the price has risen with BTC, give an easily divisible number with mBTC, and have µBTC for a comparison with one USD.
The first step is the price threads. If the mods or whoever is posting just includes or forces users to write "We hit $10k Btc ($10 mBTC, 100 µBTC/$1 USD)" then it will be easier to drive adoption. 
Everyone gets what they want!

Bitcoin doesn't have to be currency to be successful. I think it will be, but that's not the point.

Seems like from your post history you are a fan of BCash over Bitcoin anyways, so I wouldn't expect to persuade you... but I don't know how you support someone like Roger Ver. His motives are clearly not for the good of the community. IMO it's worth being political to make sure that guy never gets meaningful power over Bitcoin.
In my opinion decentralization is more important than temporarily increasing currency functionality.
The S2X disaster should show you how important it is to move slowly and make sure things work. Gardzic would have crashed the network if it was up to him. Ethereum had to hard fork to get past a mistake a dApp made. Proper development is more important than speed at this point, especially with the value of the network being what it is.
Solutions will come eventually, but it's a long road. Anyone who wants change overnight will be disappointed.

From the eyes of a Bitcoin enthusiast/citizen? 
They're way, way too broad already.
From the eyes of the US government, who's ability to monitor people and create money out of thin air (inflation) might disappear if this 'crypto thing' keeps going? 
Absolutely not. Bitcoin is undermining a lot of the power they hold. The government should rightly be terrified. This won't be the last law that's aimed at taking a chunk out of Bitcoin.
I think it's kind of funny though the predicament they are in. It's almost impossible to ban Bitcoin without it hurting the US gov. The only way Bitcoin can be crushed is if every major country in the world agrees to ban it simultaneously. If some do and some don't, it might survive... the ones that didn't ban it would control a large portion of a sought after global resource. The US needs control of oil because it's scarce. Bitcoin is scarce too, and if it's going to be widely used, it's in their best interest to control as much of it as possible.

Oh tx fees are definitely a concern, but nothing fundamental changed - that's been an issue for a while. In that context, if you liked Bitcoin a week ago you should like it even more today due to the lower price.

You take out a short on 1 btc. It costs $16,000 currently, so the CBOE or whomever basically 'gives' you $16,000. You must give them 1 btc by the date you determined when you took the short position.
If the price has gone down to $15,000, you can buy 1btc with your $16k, and pocket $1000 profit. If btc goes *up* to $18,000, well you're out $2k because the $16k they loaned you is not enough to get the btc you owe for your short. You have to liquidate your position by buying the requisite btc to cover the short.

It seems well-informed as well, which I really like. Some of the 'experts' on CNBC lately have been laughable with their lack of knowledge about crypto.
This statement is well-crafted, well thought out, and the writer has an understanding of the space above just the price gains.
It seems like the SEC is going to take a 'wait and see' approach before pushing regulation, and that's probably the right way to go. Regulation at this point could stifle innovation in the US, which would be terrible for the country. Down the road, regulation could be a good thing depending on where the space evolves to but it's too soon for that now.

You don't ever pay to receive Bitcoin, you only pay to send it.
Fees are high to buy and sell because you're doing it through an exchange which provides that as a service for money.

Roger has power now because the community is still small. He doesn't really have any whales to compete with, and therefore is the whale.

There will always be someone out there willing to lie, cheat, or steal to make a dollar. We're all greedy to some extent, but most people have limits they won't cross - Roger Ver's greed is boundless. 
He wasn't the first to fuck with Bitcoin and he won't be the last. The good news is that Ver's antics haven't seriously threatened the network, not that I can tell anyway. Bitcoin might be one of the only true democracies in the world where the users actually get to decide what happens.

Bitcoin has done great and I love it, but nobody can know what's going to happen with it.
If Bitcoin is not regulated against and continues to grow, yes, it will be the best store of value, but we can't know that yet.
I hate looking at it like a stock investment. It's more like a tech company that's been doing great so far. It might look on paper like it will replace the old tech (fiat, in this case), but it's too early to plan that parade when it isn't even 1% of the world economy.

Times like this are why it's important to understand how Bitcoin actually works, and why you are purchasing Bitcoin in the first place. 
Rule 1 of investing: Has any major event occured that made your security drop in price? 
If yes, reevaluate your position and see if you still think the asset you're buying will increase in value over the long run.
If no, purchase more. If you can't find any fundamental problems with what you bought at a higher price, purchase more - you're getting a free discount. This means that if you thought it was going to go up, you still should because no major event has occurred to make you think otherwise.

It's great that you have cryptocurrency, but that isn't a reason to avoid traditional investing. 
I'm sure you're probably joking, but Bitcoin might not go up forever. I think it will, but you should still be protected.
There are too many people on this sub that think throwing all of their money into Bitcoin is a good strategy. You can put a lot, but save using some other methods for a rainy day. It might not come, but you'll want to be prepared if it does.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:57:57
I think you're right on all points. I don't like to look at Bitcoin as a stock-type investment that will 100% go up, but a plan like that would make a lot of sense.
That business would work. I've also been thinking lately that there needs to be a good place that does online cold storage for people, a la a bank. It's not the most secure, but for Bitcoin to become very popular it will be necessary to have incredibly easy ways to hold coins.
I've relinquished myself to the fact that people may never grasp that they don't own and coin, and that they simply have right to a ledger entry on the blockchain.... but for simplicity sake it would be great if there was a place people could see 'their tokens'.
Wallets are great if you understand them, but most of the population won't. They need their hands held by someone.
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:52:12
We see things similarly, but I have a few differences.
I don't think Bitcoin needs to have utility and be a means of exchange to have value. It can supplant much of the value of fiat just being a stable store of value. 
I currently and in the future see Bitcoin as a 'world bond', of sorts. It's stable, un-inflatable, and easily transferable. It should have a modest rate of return YOY, and be very close to 100% safe if you use it properly.
Fiat in my mind has all of the utility and will be what we use to buy a pizza or beer, but likely won't be something that's good to hold long term (it already isn't).
Bitcoin will become more of a stable investment vehicle, while fiat will remain a great means of exchange.
The government will have to tax Bitcoin somehow, though, as they need to tax everything. With that said, it could force their hand and put them in a position to become less bloated. The government is not an efficient institution, and that will have to change regardless of what happens with Bitcoin - but btc might be the catalyst.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:14:56
Well it would be beneficial for the environment if the overall energy cost to run Bitcoin mining went down.
It seems if one company controls this feature then it's bad for everyone though. That obviously hurts the decentralized nature of the tokens

Haha consider me surprised. I just don't think it's reasonable to think that it should be able to handle thousands of transactions per second *yet*. 
It's one thing to make a website that can handle a serious amount of traffic quickly, but another to usurp the entire worlds monetary system. It will take time, and if you're in this sub you're in the small majority on board this early. 
Bitcoin doesn't have utility yet, we all know that. It's a great store of value, and will hopefully gain utility and become a means of instant exchange in the future.
If you want 100%+ returns yoy then you have to know it won't be perfect. If it was everyone would already use it.

It's easy to look for the cheapest exchange rates, trading fees, etc. but in a new space like Bitcoin I am more than willing to pay extra to go with an exchange that has decent support and a good reputation.
Coinbase is literally fucked. They currently have an advertisement running that says new users get $10 worth of free Bitcoin. Their support person claimed it didn't exist, and when given proof just didn't respond to me. That $10 has potentially saved me from bigger errors down the road.
When these clowns finally mean nothing to the space and we have credible institutions to trade with, you should feel ok with doing things like keeping your coins in an exchange. Until then, be very careful about who you let control your asset.

R/financialindependence will shit on Bitcoin all day, but their principles can be used for Bitcoin 'investing' (even though I think the price will rise, I prefer to consider it speculation not investment).
Use dollar cost averaging and don't try to time the market. You probably don't know what you're doing, and will end up like this guy did. Invest consistent amounts over time, and you will get a good average price.
Hold over the long run. Short term ups and downs are unpredictable, so don't pay attention to them.
Invest what you can afford to lose. Bitcoin could make you rich, but also broke if you're not careful and things go sideways. Don't fear of loss yourself into going 'all in'. 
Diversify among asset classes and rebalance your portfolio yearly. I don't mean only among cryptos, but stocks, bonds, etfs, etc. Make sure you have assets that don't react the same way to financial events. Be prepared and insulated for markets to rise, fall, and do everything in between.
Put at least 10% of your earnings every month into investment vehicles. It's not a lot and will allow you to retire comfortably if you do nothing else.
Have fun. That's what Bitcoin is. It's a fascinating space and we could be witnessing the world changing before our eyes. We could also be driving a bus off of a cliff - time will tell. Don't beat yourself up because you don't have 1,2,3 btc. $100 will get you the same roi as $10,000 - live within your means and be ready to laugh off anything negative that might happen to your holdings.

I think people would be completely shocked if they actually took the time to understand how inflation works.

'Happy' is maybe not the right word... I'm Canadian and I pay a 45% marginal tax rate, which is completely fucked. Our government misspends at every corner, and I cringe having to give them a single dollar.

That's kind of communist-ish, but communism on paper *can* make sense. I think the tax structure needs to be overhauled, and this is definitely a way it could work.
I haven't thought a tonne about how blockchains and smart contracts could be applied to other areas, but that in principle makes sense. 
I don't think the government is capable of setting up microtransactions  for everything, and I don't think they are competent enough to enforce it. In theory once it's set up it would work, but once again I doubt their ability to do so.
I personally would like to see less regulation for business and individuals and the shrinking of the government. I'm not completely libertarian though, and believe in gun control etc.

Good analogy.. Funny you say that, because I find myself explaining credit cards more than anything. People a) think they shouldn't use their credit card, or b) have credit card balances every month they are 'trying to pay off'.
A) Get a card with great dividends, it's free money. Use that card for everything you buy.
B) Only buy things you can afford, NEVER carry credit card debt.
Simple stuff, but it alludes most of the population. This is the fault of the education systems IMO. They need to force people to learn, because most won't do it themselves.

I think if Roger &amp; Co had just said that Bitcoin Cash is the coin that's the 'vision of Satoshi Nakamoto', and were honest in their communication they would gain more followers. They didn't have to ostracize the Bitcoin community by trying to hostile takeover the development. It would have been up to the users to choose. You would have people who believe in core, and people who believe in Satoshi's vision. 
There are lots of people on this sub who want to see a block size increase but were NO2X because they just didn't want these guys to be the ones who changed it. I think that's where a lot of the community stands.
Funny this tweet is by Charlie Lee, who has played Litecoin perfectly. He is pro-Bitcoin core despite probably thinking his coin is better. He's a friend of the community and well respected. If he made Bitcoin Cash instead of Roger and kept his same demeanor it would probably have twice the support it does now.

I don't like to say it, but there is definitely some form of tax avoidance happening with owners of BTC. I get what the IRS is trying to do, but this is probably not the best way to go about it.
Without regulation, these types of lawsuits will keep popping up. I'm wondering if there are any popular suggestions/ideas as to how the US *should* regulate Bitcoin? I doubt it can stay 100% anonymous, especially for tax purposes.

I doubt this is a real account I'm interacting with, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. 
Why was this wallet to wallet transaction so pertinent that you had to move it immediately?
Were you aware that this is not normal before trying to move your btc?
Are you aware that Bitcoin is still in its infancy and is not yet capable of mass-scale immediate payments? If not, does the previous statement change your mind at all?
If you're a real person that's just such a foolish thing to say.. you have to know before getting into the space what the risks and pros/cons are. Hopefully these statements aren't dissuading new people from getting in the space. Think of btc as a series a or b startup investment. You're speculating that the technology could become widespread adopted, but that it isn't anywhere near where it needs to be yet.

I'm just guessing, but the benefits for others have to be pretty high up there. Knowing you can dethrone a completely evil industry (banking) and take power away from wreckless governments has to mean something. 
I like when the price rises, but I care much more about revolutionizing an industry that has constantly failed the masses. 
Bitcoin is one of the few things in this world where the people not figuratively, but literally have the power. Bitcoin is worth what we decide it is, is developed by who we decide develops it, and is around as long as the people want it alive.
It's one of the most democratic things that's ever existed.

How do they have a monopoly if you can gain access to their patent by joining a pool with them?
Join the pool, get the patent. Simple. If they didn't have a pool (like Bitmain) to share patents then that would be a monopoly.
@_date: 2018-03-23 23:25:58


You're right. The IP in this case is a competitive advantage that could help Bitmain maintain a monopoly over sha-256 mining. 
I don't blame Bitmain for not wanting to give up a patented competitive advantage over their competitors, but you can't blame me for hoping they lose market share over the industry.
The thing is, I actually respect Bitmain a lot for what they've done for the sha-256 networks (saw you post in r/btc so I figured I'd include your coin as well). Bitmain technology has helped these networks become much stronger - every device they release into the market goes on to protect the indestructibility of the ledger.
The BDPL is removing IP as a competitive advantage for everyone who joins. Some will pay more, some will pay less, but companies will have to beat each other through operations and production - not legalese. Right now it's bad for Bitmain, but it's good for users worried about mining centralization.

@_date: 2018-03-02 03:14:46


Can someone explain this in more detail? 
I figured with a 51% attack you could create outputs that didn't exist from others to you - is this not possible?
Like I'm going through this in my head now, let me know if I'm right. You can't forge a tx signature without a private key.. that means you can't steal coins at all with a 51% attack. Why is a 51% attack even a huge risk then? I get that you could give yourself coins back, but that doesn't seem like it would be worthwhile for the cost at all.
If I'm understanding this correctly then a 51% attack isn't close to being beneficial at all. The only reason to do one would be to fuck the network, the financial gain wouldn't be substantial compared to the cost to acquire the hashpower.

The technology will catch up to the current network value of Bitcoin sooner rather than later. 
I have to say that the more I learn about SegWit, Schnorr, and Lightning, the more convinced I am that shitcoins will start to disappear and the Bitcoin price will rise again.
We all want the price to rise, let's be honest, but we're a part of something truly special. I hope everyone takes a moment from time to time to acknowledge that we're in the middle of a revolution. We'll be able to look back on it and appreciate what happened, but sometimes people don't spend time to look and see what's happening.
Hope you all have a good weekend!
