Nope still hasn't been won and the price is now 5 btc

Still a long.... way to go even if this is true before Bitcoin could be exploited. By this time all 21 mil would likely be mined and the code would, I hope have the protection it needs

Futures bastards are buying back in ready for the next dump no doubt. I have just seen the market jump from 5900 usd to 6300 usd in a matter of minutes. I really hope its the bulls back, but these dumps right before futures are too obvious

I hope so mate, sooner rather than later. My suspicion is the shorters have just loaded up ready for their next dump circa 8th and 27th of July

The shorters will be happy as the cme contract closed 4pm london time
@_date: 2018-06-29 23:09:37
No, the short contracts are every month and there are at least two of them cme (last working Friday of month) and cboe (around 14th of month) both of which have shafted crypto currency since January. It's about time the authorities got on top of this clear manipulation in the US

You've hit the nail on the head. Until we see multiple coinbase style organisations (ie simple to use), secure exchanges, super simple safe wallets (hardware wallets built into smartphones?) and retail/institute adoption we are stuck where we are.

Hope so!!

Nicely timed release of the ETF news right before the CME futures expiry tomorrow, coincidence anyone?
