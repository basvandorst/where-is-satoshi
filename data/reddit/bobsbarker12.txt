So everyone gave up on bitcoin as an electronic currency as envisioned by it's creators, so they want to throw their chips in to a 3rd party for-profit solution that requires paying central authorities 100usd to open and another 100usd to close a transaction channel.

Sealed cases of ammo netted me a tidy profit before.

I'm starting to be of the belief that this probably should be beginner material, not just running a full node instead of a light wallet. Will help people understand the abilities and limitations of their resources while ever so slightly boosting decentralization. 
After some years of bitcoin maturing 'beginners' material seems to mostly be howtos on buying shares from cloud mining enterprises, or similar rubbish that doesn't really address fundamentals. Back to the basics before ASICs?

Go back in history and you can see Luke attacking/killing other coins because he considered them scams. Luke has used his capacity to attack other networks claiming the fact they were trying to be listed on exchanges as proof they were scams: 
People should be fully aware that Luke now considers Bitcoin to be the alt and now BIP-148 is the one true path. Anyone not falling in line is open for personal attack.

This seems like a weird position for someone who is worried about centralization of bitcoin resources. Perhaps forget the profitability part, yes, but doesn't mining by individuals serve real purpose in securing the blockchain?

Sounds like almost the same situation. Authy came through in the end, I just had to hold my breath for a day or so while drowning in worries.

Gotta love that economic terrorism.

Hopefully this resolves for you. I had a similar problem but it was on Authy's end, after some waiting they manually reviewed the request and authorized it. Tedious process though. -.-

Substantiate your claims.
