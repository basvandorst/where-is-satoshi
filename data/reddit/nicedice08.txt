it wasn't that wikileaks changed... It was that they've likely forever been a propaganda arm for the highest bidder.

my DL and selfie photo do not match bc different  hairstyle
so i haven't been able to access coinbase to buy.
if you're going to have ppl upload their driver's license and then take a selfie
at least make a decent website to support this.


Agreed there's something shady abt Coinbase.
called support they set it priority but  it will still take 5-6 business days to get back to me

remember when btc center asked apple if they could start btc for payment use at apple,
apple said no  and started apple pay.
pls don't support apple pay.

He moved to Japan in 2005 after serving a 10-month prison sentence for illegally selling explosives. He renounced his United States citizenship in 2014 after he became a citizen of Saint Kitts and Nevis. In 2015, he was denied a visa to reenter the United States by the U.S. Embassy in Barbados, which claimed that he had not sufficiently proven ties outside of the United States that would motivate him to leave at the end of his visit...

Anglin, in a phone interview, confirmed to the Post that he uses Bitcoin almost exclusively. “Bitcoin has helped out a lot,” he said.

when i first got into bitcoin in 2013 
i was really excited about the fact that bitcoin was decentralized unlike the dollar in which the government didn't have a hold of but the ppl around were mostly all libertarians. i'm not a libertarian but still love bitcoin but you can't deny the fact that it is enabling alot of rightwing nuts.
