ok, i will tell you a secret. But promise me to keep it to yourself.
With a normal bank account u can actually make transactions without withdrawing money. It is widely known as online-banking. Cash can be seen as an addition to that for situations where it's not possible to pay online or just more comfortable. (like for example markets in south east asia, africa, wherever...)

So I basically can get a 100,000 $ loan to build a house from Bitcoin Sunday night at 3 am ?
Or am I missing something?

two parts are very interesting about that, first the identity varification at mt. gox (quoting the speaker: "very good company, very competent, they are very good at what they do"), which I guess I do not have to comment any further and second that you need to have "trust in the identify varification" because "people can lend money to themselves to improve their credit rating" - these are btw. also quotes of the speaker.
trust and lending money (especially to people you don't know anything about) is a biiiiiig problem and the huge amount of insecurities in such a concept would lead to an explosion of the interest rate, so that in the end noone affords to pay 15% pa for a 300,000 $ house.

I could not find any Bitcoin ATM though...
