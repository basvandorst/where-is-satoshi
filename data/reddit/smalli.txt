Our intergalactic currency just went from being worth 1 of itself to 0 of itself!! 
Just a bad reference to lighten the mood :)

I’d liquidate all my assets for flurbo coin

What if the governments do a hard shut down? The US says no more or you **go to jail**. Then they enforce it with the Army. Try fighting the US government over this. Get real, governments are not going to sit passively as their national currency becomes useless.
I think bitcoins future is not as a currency, but a store of value that is not tied with banks. And I believe it could be very good at that.

Didn’t even notice that till now lol. 
Another expert at ShortTheBitcoin.com claims the price is going to $3,000

I think bitcoin is a massive bubble and a kin to a pyramid scheme. If bitcoin is about eliminating the financial elite, then amway is about-eliminating the managerial elite. 
Investment banks are only embracing bitcoin because they are manipulating the market, then gonna short it. 
That’s just my opinion though, I could be wrong.

Also, we elect the people, but we are not the people who govern. And the people we elect don't always do what they say. THEY are the people.

You believe the USD will lose its role as the worlds reserve, Why?
Are our treasury bonds not safe enough?

Till congress says no? Bitcoins could be taxed additionally on top of capital gains tax and there's nothing anyone can do about it.

I don't believe so, stocks are based on companies that have real tangible value to it and they're subject to extensive regulations. An asset class it could be is cash-equivalents, but is much too volatile to be regulated as such by the SEC. This is a fiat-based cash system being regulated as some risky security. They could change their mind about that if it gets too big. In its current state, probably not unless it was discovered that the interests of the US were directly being compromised by bitcoins. It's just a novelty right now. It's being taxed as capital gains because the US government doesn't know, or care, what to do with it quite yet. They do want the tax revenue in the meantime. 
Just another risk factor to consider.

Tax policy would be an extreme measure, but an extreme event could happen to trigger it. Or it could gradually get too big over time (people start accepting it as cash much more broadly).
Short term: Id buy a few bitcoins for fun, but would sell right away if I heard a major company start accepting it as payment. That's when it transitions to security to cash. Not enough people take it as cash to be considered anything, but people are making the assumption it will over time (especially those hedge fund managers).
Long term estimates (5-10 years) bitcoin price will level out (at a level god knows what) once it does people may start accepting it as cash. It could be less volatile than today and more convenient id imagine. If it gets taxed like a dollar transaction is, then it must be converted to USD to pay the tax. The government will intervene and stop bitcoins before it's too late to prevent a financial crisis similar to mortgage backed securities failing in 2008. 
Could you imagine the fed buying 1 trillion worth of bitcoins in the future to prevent economic collapse?

Yes it's tax as capable gains right now, but if it's use as currency replacement or money equivalents (m2 money supply), then that would give congress power to add an additional tax on all bitcoin to USD conversions on top of capital gains. Right now with the market cap so low, I don't really think there's that much risk. 
It could be discovered or suspected that foreign countries are funding terrorism with gains made on bitcoin, countries all around the world may put controls or outright ban bitcoins. 
Not that I agree with, terrorism can be funded by oil, but not by much smaller % bitcoin. I just want people to take into account all risks before doing any investing. (Also I'm interning at a capital management boutique with $10 billion in assets). These bitcoin risks are what our senior analyst gave a presentation on the other day.

Where directly if it was brought up tomorrow, congress decides what congress does. I don't believe their to be enough support for congress to care, especially if they're were actually or perceived reasons to ban it. 
The government is a republic and is ruled by people granted power by a democratic process. Once elected, they can disregard the people if they chose.

I'm just very passionate about this subject. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:48:44
Fair enough, although it could be called money and be included in the M2 money supply metric
You're right that it's not currency, that's only physical cash. M2 money supply is less liquid than currency, but can quickly be converted to . These are called cash-equivalents.
Since it is a cash-equivalent, especially in terms of USD, it could be regulated as money. Congress could pass a tax whenever bitcoins are converted to USD, AND tax the realized gains as other securities. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:02:43
I know people thinks it's high risk because of price fluctuations, but that may continue to grow for a bit as the perception on bitcoins future seem bright. Creating some cool cyber-fiat system of currency, it's worth something because people think it's worth something. That's all, that's how the USD works actually. 
Right now it's going through a positive feedback loop and dramatically increasing in value.
However government regulations could be detrimental to the market. That could create another feedback loop and crash the market really god damn quickly. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:34:48
No, if it's viewed as the intent of the term "foreign coin" within the context of the banking act of 1865, then congress would have the power to tax over in one session. Implementing the tax would not even take that long. They're already in the system as securities! 
I don't even know if the Supreme Court would challenge it and set a new precedent paving the way for a more sophisticated and powerful crypto currency down the road.
And what would someone do if they did pass it? Once that news hits everyone's gonna sell and no one is gonna buy all at the same time. Market is now magnitudes less valuable, but it won't go away. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:31:19
Yeah, but a lot of countries still peg their value to the dollar. In order to this they must maintain a certain trade balance. 85%* of all forex exchanges are done in USD. 
Also the biggest pushers for a single world decentralized currency are Russia and China**. I'm sure they have a good plan to benefit the rest of the world and not just themselves. 
Having one common currency is a terrible idea in my opinion because inflation rates could not be secured enough in any country. Also if one country has a complete breakdown, the world value of the currency would drop for everyone.
Money supply has to be carefully monitored and adjusted to meet monetary policy goals.

I believe that if bitcoin gets too big in the future (like target or amazon accepting it big) it would be responsible of the government to prevent it as being used as cash. Not being to control the money supply that well can lead to more volatile inflation and interest rates, which is bad for the long term economy. 
Till then, I don't see a reason to ban it. It may never reach that level. Just tax it as capital gain. Although I agree, with the current US administration it could happen tomorrow. 
Trump could hear about a terror group funded by bitcoins (which wouldn't be a terrible way to do that right now, I'm definitely on some list now) he could enact dramatic measures which could be defended in the supreme court if congress agrees.
