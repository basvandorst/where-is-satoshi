But they are very likely liable for cases where individuals purchased stolen (read: non-existent) bitcoins from the exchange, especially when the lending system is involved.

Are you aware of any compromise to Bitfinex's user data (e-mail addresses, etc?)

If you can't cover your lenders' loss, given this language and the way bitfinex handled similar situations related to volatility, you are insolvent and lenders will gun for your bankruptcy.

Yeah, this is a bail-in using lenders' funds. Unfortunately for bitfinex, these users are the most likely to be able to afford lawyers and force the exchange into bankruptcy. Bitfinex also won't be protected under the guise of their "segregated wallets" claims against these users' legal attacks.

Your most recent post in this thread just effectively said lenders bear the entire risk if margin holders purchased stolen coins. ("What are you going to return to the lender?") This is unacceptable if my debtor still has assets in their account that can be liquidated.

I have the resources to take legal action. There are multinational legal firms that specialize in modern, global, corporate structures. Bitfinex is not untouchable. It's entirely possible that my realized haircut loss easily outweighs my potential legal fees. I guess we'll all find out tomorrow, eh?

Thanks, but it does feel prudent to immediately inform users if personally identifiable information (e-mails, addresses, identity documents) was potentially exposed in this compromise. This will also help limit your liability in civil suits resulting from identity theft, FWIW.
