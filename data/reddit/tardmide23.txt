Banks are trying to shake you and me out so they can buy cheap.... just look how desperate the big media has been to report a "crash" the past few months every time bitcoin declines by 1,000... and believe me.. big media works for them. This most recent crash occurred just after goldman announced it was opening a trading desk.
The bitcoin is currently nearly twice what it was at the end of November and yet so many "respectable" outlets are claiming crash. Let that sink in.
Why do they keep claiming it's crashing? Because big financial institutions have caught on and are doing dumps so they can buy it for cheap... and then the price will go even higher, and they'll sell it back to you.
CNBC has been practically publishing a new article every hour about the "crash." They're desperate to get what you have. Normal people aren't supposed to have valuable assets, only fiat which can be inflated, stocks which are crashed ALL the time (but you can't mention this....), and houses under 30yr mtgs where if you miss one payment the bank steals the house.
They are filled with vitriol that so many Joe Smoe's have gotten their hands on something valuable that they can't just print more off, heavily tax or take back due to a missed payment.
oh and before some faggot calls me out for being "new", I've been on this site for 5+ years, but if your holding crypto its a great idea to change your accounts.
