1. Will Bitfinex's own BTC holdings will be part of socialized losses or only trading accounts?
2. In care of considering business continuity which seems now more probable to me, have you considered offering certain loss points or tokens equal to social loss, which may be redeemed or adjusted against trading fees or credited gradually on keeping a balance in exchange.

If BTC was dumped for BCH it wouldn't be the case. Invalid argument as BCH fell much more vs BTC.
Infact it is overall crypto price correction cycle as usual.

Yes, it can. LTC went from $40 to $1 and $300+ again.

It will be below 10k within weeks. I will put buy order at 10.1k orders to be safe.

Could be. thanks. By the way I sold 2/3 BTC for Bitcoin Cash after paying 51$ and 38$ to get them on exchange.
