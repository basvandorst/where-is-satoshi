This is the best chapter in the Bitcoin drama yet. Who needs Game of Thrones when we have Bitcoin news.

I tend to trust actions more than words. Gox may be saying that this is a temporary problem, but ALL their actions taken together suggest that isn't the case AT ALL.

There is only one reason why Mark is not being transparent. The truth would freak people out more than having the price crash down to 100. That fact tells you how bad things really are for Gox.

Why does everyone use the word "founder"? It's so misleading.

Mark ran the first and biggest Bitcoin exchange. I highly doubt he's as incompetent as these events are making him look. More likely, the Gov is using him to taint public opinion of Bitcoin.

Now, is it security for what has happened, or security for what they know will be coming? I'm betting on the latter.

Awesome post and an apt metaphor.
We've talked before about recognizing features within alt coins that are working and using them in Bitcoin. I think we've all thought that would be code. There are two things that are great about Doge, but they aren't in the code, they're in the community. The first thing is switching to a format that uses whole numbers. We can do this with Bitcoin by using mBTC, uBTC or Satoshis, rather than BTC as the main unit of transaction. The other successful trait of Doge is the positive and encouraging community. This post is a great example of the second successful trait that we can adopt. Great job!

Watch only addresses go hand in hand with cold storage. It's a way to keep track of your money, without having the private key ever touch the internet.
Step 1. Print out a paper wallet from a device that hasn't touched the internet.
Step 2. In blockchain.info, create a watch address based on the public key on your paper wallet.
Step 3. Send .001 BTC to the address, just to make sure you have the address right.
Step 4. When it confirms and you are sure everything is cool, send the rest of your coins to that address.
Step 5. Use blockchain.info to track the funds on that address. It will show up as "Watch only", so you know that if your blockchain account is hacked, the coins still can't be taken. The private key is fully offline.
Step 6. When you want to use the money in the address, go into blockchain.info and import/sweep the private key. This will bring all the money online, and allow you to send the money around.
Step 7. Once you have spent as much of the money as you need to, create another watch only address using another paper wallet, and put money there, like before.

What happens if aliens come down and use an EMP and giant magnets to take down the Internet? or..or What happens if the guys at bitcoin decide to make more coins? or...or What happens if I don't have running water, electricity, a phone or an automobile?

This is just a shoddy way to set up paying in Bitcoin. A tablet that produces QR codes with the payment amount embedded in is the way to go.

Follow the smart people.
If you pay attention to the people who are suggesting that Bitcorn is a bubble or that it's over-valued, you'll very likely conclude as I have, that they are fucking idiots. Their hollow arguments fall apart on careful consideration.
However, is you listen to the smart people, they are all very positive about Bitcoin, and suggest the potential for growth is huge. Personally, I like to put my money on the smart people.

The time of Kings, Presidents and leaders is slowing ending. We've operated in this way for a long time, but it just isn't working anymore.
The Internet, Bitcoin and open source software are all examples of the new paradigm that is emerging in our society, a paradigm that does away with false hierarchies. We are moving to a new way of being where we don't need Government to "look after us" like children.
Transitions are scary, and facing this cultural shift will take courage. We have to die to our old world, and create a new one. Like every stage of cultural development, the new one will be worth the effort in creating it.

Some people prefer reading documents and FAQs. For others, interaction works better to learn a new topic. It's about learning styles, and being sensitive to different learning styles is a good thing for fostering a community.

Maybe look into the concept of multiple intelligences, or lines of development.
It turns out that people can be developed in certain things and not developed in other things. The traditional idea of a "genius" is a simplistic way of seeing intelligence. People can be a genius in math and have no social skills to speak of. Hitler is a great example. He was a really good public speaker, but was morally a slug. High social intelligence. Low moral intelligence.
The Winklevi are exceptionally good at recognizing potential. They might not have the presentation skills of Steve jobs, but that's no reason to say "Fuck em". Sociability is only one line of many.

Dead? Why then, if you look at the number of wallets created on Blockchain.info, does it appear to be growing exponentially? Thousands of ATMs will be deployed in the next two years. The world's first Bitcoin bank just opened. Investment is flooding into the space.
Bitcoin is the Honey Badger of money. Why do you think it got that name? It really doesn't give a shit. It's an anti-fragile crazy fuck.

Bitcoin is synonymous with crypto-currency, much like Kleenex is synonymous with tissues. Therefore, general news or events that affect crypto-currency in general are fine being posted in this sub, imo. The bobsled news was relevant in that it brought attention to all cryptos and their use in charity. If it's something that doesn't matter in the general space of cryptos, then keep it in the appropriate sub.
