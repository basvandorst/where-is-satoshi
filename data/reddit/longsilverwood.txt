holding worked for me. I would have lost a lot of money if I sold to fud when it first hit 4.9k. I held since 2k and i feel like around then was more worry than now. but than again thats because ill always be in the gains now but i still never sold and don't plan on it as long as technology is the countinously being worked on

if adaption really starts than eventually the IRS will have to see cryptocurrency as an actual currency and not an asset. Things can change in the future.

that's a really good point. that's another reason I like LN because it's like an advancement in coding which in other words is an advancement in technology. It opens the door to a lot more

wasn't directed towards you (: just a general statement so he can understand the ocean he is in so he can educate himself on different things! 
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:21:00
that's an easy one. Just watch Andrea's videos on youtube. He's been making videos for years and always been preaching the same points till this very day today.
"andreas antonopoulos" on youtube. Very informational.

Also becareful with scripts to make sure there is no code in it to steal your information.  I know some people might actually want to help but some people can also do the opposite. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:29:41
That's pretty small minded. You aren't thinking about the rest of the world. All your thinking about is USD. Here's a video that can give you some more ideas on another scale.

I don't think it exists to be honest. Majority of exchanges have to follow the law of the place you live. You can always use a bitcoin ATM though or buy bitcoin using cash from another person.
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:39:21
There is definitely a lot to learn! after learning you'll officially be more tech smart because bitcoin teaches a lot. 
Check out this guys youtube videos, He's known as the bitcoin legend because of all his informational videos he's been sharing for years educating many many people! He will teach you a lot you need to know.
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:08:54
it's not even possible to happen suddenly. People own bitcoin all over the world.Throughout any dips,half of the people are probably sleeping lol.

You don't lower it by paying less if that's what you assumed? It almost seemed like that when I read it. 
Fees already can be lowered. There's a pretty small percentage of the market who's adopted Segwit ino their wallets. Segwit increases the block size which would overall lower fees and make faster transactions. This is a matter of companies implementing it. Also LN will need segwit to launch, when LN launches fees can be nearly non existent and transactions will be nearly instant. We just have to hope companies get their shit together and hire some darn coders but you can be assure that they will when they realize compettion is adopting. The early bird gets the worm.

not true at all. You do realize freezing bank accounts won't have much an affect. Only noobs use coinbase who don't even have much in it. And anyone who has a lot invested controls their own private keys which banks have no control over. There's many other exchanges that trade bitcoin even more than GDAX. you just assumed GDAX is the main way to trade bitcoin but it's actually not. Also if banks did that than everybody would just leave their banks because this will add more support to crypto for it's decentralization. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:16:02
You haven't actually dove deep enough into how bitcoin actually works. You should honestly research it more because it's very interesting and addicting stuff because how brilliant it is!
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:03:28
It's also very easy not to lose your money. It teaches simple responbility. this is why bitcoin is good. See how easily people lose their common sense because of relying on banks and things like that. It's healthy to remember that you need to be in control of these things. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:09:24
bitcoin will have a similiar fate to the internet it's self. That's how big bitcoin really is.. Whent he internet first came out everyone doubted it. Now the internet has changed our world and bitcoin can have that same fate.

has no effect long term. They're simply doing what every country will do. They basically just want to know who's buying crypto. In Korea they allow you to be anonymous using your bank, To my understanding they have banks that can create a new type ID every time it's being used. So they are basically saying you must create an offical bank account, one that can't just reset it's ID when buying crypto's. This is mostly to try and prevent things like money laundering, so majority of countries will do this I believe. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:37:06
Those are some shitty banks! I would look to change your bank. If it's a purchase you authitorize and yet they still closing the accounts than it's a bank you can't trust.
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:05:31
complete shit post, just look at the nearly last sentence. People like this know NOTHING about decentralization. This is just another shit article supporting banks. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:10:50
I didn't see anything about bitcoin. What's with all these people posting irrelevant videos with clickbait titles. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:13:58
that was pretty painful to listen to. Any new crypto songs should include technical information to make it feel more legit. One like this is just annoying and illogical. 
Crypto can definitely be in hiphop but if you wanna write bars it needs to have logic in it not just random gibberish. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:05:42
Being real it won't drop all the way to 5k. whales could probably bring it down to 8kish but everyone knows in the back of their head 5k is a gold mine price to get a chance of owning a decent amount of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:00:03
If this is your way of advertising a shit video using a clickbait thread than i hope people give it a bunch of dislikes.
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:15:18
I'm pretty sure most of the things he mentioned are actual projects in development. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:53:37
he's from jersey? I live in nyc, maybe I can buy this? How would I avoid any scam in this? 
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:11:05
That's called FUD. Get use to it and teach them to be aware of it. It will always be around just like trolls are always around. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:30:48
people asked this same question when it first hit 5k, holding it always seems to work out because you just can't really stop it.
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:16:51
The last bitcoin won't be mined for over 100 years from now. There's probably better questions you can be asking!
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:01:06
I think the mods do a good job considering how heavily this sub is always getting flooded with spam attacks with the rapid growth of this sub. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:10:50
I noticed it was posted 21 days ago, did you just recently find it as a new post? I will try contacting them in case their legit.

They will have no choice but to adopt. Because the ones who adopt first will get the most traffic and attention and money and the others will follow. It's a chain reaction. And these type of adoptions are also good because it will encourage exchanges to be equipped with social engineers.

Coinbase is trying to be just like a bank, it's why majority of us in the community are against leaving your coins in an exchange. They can easily 'lose' your coins and you will never get it back. So you need to take matters into your own hands, download a wallet that lets you have access to your own private keys. Write down your private key on paper and store it somewhere safe and keep a copy of it. Your private key is very important since anyone that access's it can access all your coins. That's apart of becoming your own  bank. So learn more about the safest ways in holding your bitcoins. If you have a lot invested, the best way is usually buying a hardware wallet.

Made an account just to troll on here? It's okay I'll assume that's the best part of your life
