Sorry to be critique, but I wonder what extra security Glacier Protocol offers over my method as described below...
All the following operations are done on an offline computer with downloaded source code...
1. Create 3 different private keys with bitaddress.org source code and write them down on a notebook.
2. Generate 2-3 multi-sig with these private keys using coinb.in source code.
3. Transfer fund to this multi-sig address and remove all traces of private key generation from the offline computer by formatting it.
^^This appears to be the cheapest and safest over anything else. No?

It is pretty unfortunate that support to what the Ethereum Foundation is trying to do is coming from some bitcoin legendary like u &amp; Andreas. May be some of u are deeply invested in the DAO and ETH and hence doing it. But, please explain me the following if u can...
What happened to DAO is just bug. But, why the fuck Ethereum Foundation is trying to hard fork the Ethereum blockchain to recover the fund? This is bloody centralization. Where were they while ShapeShift was hacked? Why was not a hard fork proposal then? Why are u silent on that?

Considering the nature of problem Indians are facing, Bisq does no better than LBC. In the last 4 years, they have already built a huge database of bank accounts related to crypto with the help of centralized exchanges that were operating in India so far. Now they are monitoring those bank accounts. As and when they feel, they are enquiring about transactions. If the response is not satisfactory, they are banning both accounts involved.
Bisq is great and eventually Indians need to move over there. But, Bisq does NOT help in any way to solve the current problem.

Online P2P, that involves individual's bank account, **is not** a legal loophole. It **is illegal**. Exchanges and paid media are misinforming gullible Indians for own profit and thereby putting them into future legal trouble.
Here is the RBI statement...
*In view of the associated risks, it has been decided that, with immediate effect, entities regulated by RBI shall not deal with or provide services to* **any individual** *or business entities dealing with or settling VCs.*

Using Bisq is pretty risky in India as card fraud is pretty rampant over here. A seller on Bisq has no way to verify identity of the buyer. Hence, if the buyer is a fraudster and he transfers INR through card fraud, the seller is fu**ed. Because, police will follow the money trail and knock the seller's door. Seller cant claim that he sold bitcoin to gain the money as using a bank a/c for bitcoin transaction is now itself illegal.

I think, u dint understand the scenario I depicted. Fraudsters do card fraud and route it through bank transfer to buy crypto. I dunno how it works in your country.

If UASF like unscientific Sybil attack is applied to implement SegWit today, the same can be done to raise 21m market cap 21 years later. I'm in early 30 and Bitcoin is NOT an Experiment to me. It will be a question of my future and matter of my survival even after 21 years. And I'm sure, that is the case for thousands of young people across the globe. Hence, any process, that allows to raise 21m cap without having majority hash power or majority coin holding has to be resisted for a very long time.

Because private key is basically a big number. It is same irrespective of software usage. But, when u use seed, u need a derivation procedure, which varies from software to software.

*Good. But, here is what said about JS's usage in Bitcoin...*
As someone who has spent time reviewing cryptographic software professionally: Javascript is nearly impossible to review for security.
Reviewing software for security means making sure it doesn't do anything it's not supposted to do, but javascript makes that essentially impossible because there are no enforced interfaces and basically anything can happen at any distance: code far away from the code you're using can arbitrarily override things.
The execution environment, even the fastest of them is slow enough that best practice verification approaches cannot be used (and so arn't used). The execution environment also provides no mechanisms for standard security practice like constant time / sidechannel resistant operation or keeping keys out of swap.
In addition to the limitations of the language and the execution environment the ecosystem around javascript is toxic to writing secure software. Completely unreviewed and untested, even outright backdoored software is imported everywhere with little thought given.
I wouldn't say javascript itself is a main reason why the common paperwallet approaches are bad, but it contributes.

Not sure why u r here. I use bitcoin to buy domain &amp; hosting. Never tried drug and have no interest to ever try either.

Frankly, I'm not surprised. They are running the show for almost an year with 0% house edge. Rising fee is burning their marginal profit.

* comment is an eye opener. Thanks for that. But, historically we have not seen the randomness generated by bitaddress.org to be weak.
* Only Bitcoin Core can read wallet.dat. Almost any wallet software can read WIF. And I'm against storing naked keys in text format. Its better to be kept as image for hard drive storage. Otherwise, writing it in a diary is better option.
* Tools related to SegWit are not yet time tested.

Doesn't matter. Free money is good for us, the HODLers. I really wish BCH, BSV, BTG, BCD etc. rises along with BTC. Because, being a HODLer of BTC, I automatically own all of them. ;)
*p.s. Looking at the downvotes, it seems, people are pretty offended knowing my HODLing of BCH, BSV, BTG, BCD etc.* :D

How much was BTC at that point? Moreover, BCH has already given birth to BSV. I wish, few more children are born till we reach ATH.

I like your super clean mobile friendly ranking page. But, why should people chose your exchange over shapeshift.io, coinomat.com or changelly.com?

Is there anything unsafe in downloading the bitaddress.org code from Github in a malware free computer and creating 3 private key offline to generate a multi-sig address? All it requires to write down those 3 private key in a diary and removing them from the computer before getting online again.
@_date: 2017-06-11 14:27:08
 is not opening at my end. Is it  ?
@_date: 2017-06-04 10:33:46
Please be specific about your query.
**There is no MASF in 2009.** is a statement of yours, on which I have nothing to say.
**What do you know about Bitcoin? ** - A lot of things that u might not imagine.
Now, please ask me a specific question. :)
@_date: 2017-06-18 01:17:42
Good proposal indeed.

What if IBM &amp; Intel walks in?
@_date: 2017-06-07 20:28:27
I have 2 questions if u care to respond...
1. Is your holding just 1m+ USD or u r holding multi-million dollar in bitcoin, i.e. ~10m USD or more.
2. Do u have all your holding in BTC or is it spread across other crypto as well?
