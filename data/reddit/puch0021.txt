+1 for point  - for mining payments I have deposits that cost 0 so it would be nice to add them in without having to have an associated fiat cost

Wouldn't a multi-algorthm approach be a more conservative compared to an outright change, say SHA2 + X Y or Z

I have similar criticisms. Transactions and outputs across the board are down in crypto. I realize some are attributing that to segwit, batching, less spam, but realistically I'd attribute the majority of the low fee situation right now due to decreased transactions in the cryptocurrency market in general. If transactions went back to levels in Dec and January, we'd be in a similad high fee situation as before. 
That doesn't mean I'm knocking scaling solutions as worthless, I'm just being realistic with the data as presented. To me, you'd be hard pressed to say that the down turn of the cryptomarket isn't the primary driver of lower fees. 
In 2018 (shamelessly pulled from YeOldDoc)
[Average transaction fee]( dropped ~92%
[SegWit adoption]( increased ~4%.
[Number of outputs]( dropped ~14%.
[Number of transactions]( dropped ~28%.
I haven't come across any objective data of spam so please post some data that I can review.

It has, looking at that link it clearly shows overall transactions are down. Outputs are down. But consider the general context - all of crypto including ethereum is also down. Unless someone can provide objective data, I think it was FOMO that drove the market to all time highs and the mempool congestion rather than outright spam. 
I think that overall outputs/transaction the biggest driver by a long shot as to why the mempool is clear. That said, segwit and batching helps and we need to continually push to get better scaling regardless. 
The problem is not over just because the mempool is clear. If we again in the future reach a level of use near the last ATH, and do so with out massive fees due to scaling, then it will be bitcoins ability that speaks for itself. Otherwise you get other coins gathering market share when congestion is bad, adding to Bitcoin Cash's main argument regarding fees and speed.

Disruptive innovation that challenges the current system of currency to evolve.

Because mainstream media banks FUD Bitcoin as a vehicle for fraudulent activity and money laundering. It's ironic banks get caught for the same thing.

I wish more of the technical developments would stay on top of the front page. While fun, the memes cover up the the under the hood tech that is going on. It's exciting to think 2018 and on will for bitcoin.
