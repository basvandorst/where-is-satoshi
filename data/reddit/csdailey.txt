I think mythbusters tested this out and I don’t think it supported both of them

Did anyone actually purposely sell in december in order to buy in late january?
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:47:31
You would think.. but december 1st it jumped around $600 ($10,124 to 10,714) in an hour from 6-7am and then rose to $11,190 from december 1st 7am to december 3rd 4am. You would think it would drop at this point, but then rose $400 from 4-5am on december 3rd.

I'd put it all in btc atm until the market settles. litecoin and ethereum just follow btc whenever there's a dip.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:23:44
There was a big sell around 1:30 and 2:30. If it doesnt dip again at 3:30 then Im buying back in
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:14:36
It's been stuck below 12000 for a while and hasnt got up much. I wouldnt worry imo
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:02:23
11428/9000 = 126.97%
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:43:16
After futures maybe?
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:29:42
Every here says educate yourself... but bitcoin is different than anything seen before. If this was an actual stock, you'd cash out right now. No one knows shit
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:55:57
That could work. Read the FAQ. They have a section on buying and selling. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:19:46
When you applied how long did you hodl?
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:41:53
I sold before the dip, then bought at 11400, and then sold at 11150 and bought at 11050 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:38:58
Go to bed
@_date: 2018-09-13 17:11:24
With some basic TA, I've calculated that we'll hit 7k between Sept 16-19 depending on how fast things go. After that who knows what'll happen.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:40:31
I think its done dipping :)

Personally, I think it's a good idea to invest a tiny amount to get a better understanding of everything. Then when you realize how much money you're losing by not investing more is when you should invest more
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:42:33
Perhaps their records of you are outdated.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:42:04
I'm sorry
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:52:55
"It’s a utility token for criminals, terrorists, money launderers, tax evaders" I just assume anyone who says this is full of shit.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:45:23
11k too low
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:30:51
Isn't this the exact same thing as a lot of tech companies? It's the idea that it could be used in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:17:22
Well isn't the 21 mil limit because the reward for btc miners decreases by 50% every couple years or so? Where exactly does the reward for mining come from?
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:28:51
When to buy back in??
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:46:15
Made this mistake as well, only lost $400 though
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:45:41
Whats happening with coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:41:32
Just wait. They are so swamped with people on their network 
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:08:59
You bought btc with a loan? Damn. Atleast you've made 27k already
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:04:27
EDIT: Sorry, wait like 2 minutes
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:29:47
Facebook is where I go to get all my facts and information
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:16:53
Well crypto is not computer engineering, it's computer science, which makes sense why it'd not be widely talked about in that field. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:50:41
Transfer to an exchange
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:53:06
Do it. I started with $100 initially and then two weeks later put in like $1500 because gains
@_date: 2018-09-13 23:18:38
Hmm not really. There's more to it than that
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:56:05
lol noobies
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:08:03
I sold, hopefully it dips
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:55:19
What am i even reading
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:15:44
But what if I don't want to not invest what I can't not purchase if I don't not want to not make gains when I don't buy 
@_date: 2018-09-20 04:08:25
This is gold
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:39:23
Your family would rather have you than the bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-09-13 20:56:40
Let me guess, you heard that from other people? It's useful up to a point. I think the issue is when people follow it religiously. I find it pretty helpful for resistance lines.
@_date: 2018-09-13 17:44:44
If you follow the bottom resistance of today's rally, it reaches \~7k in 3 days. However, this is also assuming nothing else changes.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:17:45
Calling it. Another dip in 13 minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:14:49
Didnt the dotcom bubble recover though?
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:28:54
Hey when are you buying back in? I sold around the same time. I might just buy back in when it dips like 3%... and forever hodl. Korea is like 20% higher than us atm so I think it might go up even more...
@_date: 2018-08-08 02:26:01
I think it was fake

You sound really old and you honestly kinda have sheep like ideals. The economic gap is increasing. Crime happens because people are poor. People aren’t able to afford education. How do you solve this problems? Being self sufficient doesn’t answer any of these, but basic income does. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 18:53:59
Perhaps, this is my personal opinion, but the type of voice the article is written in feels like he's trying to persuade me, instead of presenting the information unbiased. Second, there are ads that look like they are targeted towards uninformed old people. There's an ad talking about 1000% return on bitcoin and at the bottom there's a section with "IS THIS TRUMP'S PROMISED INFRASTRUCTURE BOOM?". These all raise big red flags for me and makes it very hard to trust the source. Regardless of the actual content, I find it very low quality. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 18:40:12
So what you're saying is, less taxes mean more economic growth, which in return there are less poor people because of better jobs? My argument is that basic income can allow people to better themselves through education instead of working minimum wage, which in return increases economic activity because there are more well educated people in the country. 
@_date: 2018-07-25 02:39:51
Education benefits the country as a whole and can be used to allow upwards economic mobility. I am willing to pay more in order to have a more educated country. The fact that you wouldn't is concerning, unless your argument is that more of the country shouldn't be educated?
@_date: 2018-07-31 03:35:49
Doing that would cost \~$2k, assuming a .10% fee right? I just don't understand the POV of the trader. Sure, at that price range, there are a lot of profits, but it seems risky. In this case, it seems like it didn't do anything.
@_date: 2018-07-28 18:16:37
Looks like garbage
@_date: 2018-07-30 22:48:29
Someone put up a 200 btc buy wall and someone sold into it. There was \~260 traded within a few seconds at around \~8180. Thoughts? 
@_date: 2018-07-29 21:06:44
Hmm I don't think you're understanding the argument.
@_date: 2018-07-28 18:57:55
You should respond and say you're underage lol
@_date: 2018-07-25 02:44:37
You're comparing "poor" in countries with different economic levels. It's all relative. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 22:52:07
So you're worried about inflation or what? Correcting inflation is really just a matter of figuring out the correct implementation of the system imo. There's a certain threshold where the increase of basic income would not be beneficial. Currently, we basically already have a form of basic income with tax cuts, food stamps, etc.
