Represenative director is the literal translation of 代表取締役, which is the highest position in a company recognized in Japanese law, I believe. Any other titles like CEO or President are only for internal use and dont have legal meaning in company registration.

I put one in on the 24th and the 26th and both are still stuck at confirmed. If they don't go through on the 6th, I will start worrying.

Yeah, the first one went through a little later, but the second took over a week after that.

A lot of places dont take credit cards. Most nonchain restaurants, smaller supermarkets, etc only take cash.
There are plenty of computer illiterate people all over the world, so i cant say how Japan ranks there, but the continued usage and importance of fax machines boggles my mind.

They should fund NASA with it.

Damn, you are really nice person. You have inspired me to figure out how this tipping thing works and hop on board.

Mt Gox works fine for accounts in Japan, in fact they just switched banks, letting bank transfers happen within an hour during business hours.

I listened to this planet money podcast about the bank transfer system and had my mind blown by how arcane and inefficient the system is. Now with bitcoin, I can transfer my money around the world in a couple minutes, but it takes multiple days for coinbase to deposit in my account (and I don't blame the slowness on coinbase, they seem quite a bit speedier than regular bank to bank transfers).

Coinbase isn't really the place for fast trading, from what I understand, unless you want a couple instant coins. I'd buy coins through Coinbase, then switch them over to BTC-E, Bitstamp, etc., for trading, then transfer back to Coinbase when/if you want to cash out.

Yeah,  'naka' and 'moto' are ridiculously common as parts of names, eg tanaka, nakata, nakao, nakagawa, nakamura and yamamoto, sakamoto, motomura, inomoto, etc. 
This is the dumbest theory.
