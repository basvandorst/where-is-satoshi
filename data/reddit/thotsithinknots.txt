Bitcoin transaction costs were expensive af in December. No wonder. Congrats to all the miners!
@_date: 2018-08-16 03:34:26
Its centralized in China

Prepare to be downvoted for expressing the original intention of cryptocurrency. If youre not cheerleading bitcoin exclusively then you must be promoting a shitcoin!!11+ I still like bitcoin. My issues is it is slow and it is expensive for mainstream use. Hell. We all know that. It is the correct direction and I'm fine with it being the sacrificial lamb but it cant keep up to other tech when it is being throttled intentionally.

Decentralized apps are the future. Yes they issue tokens. Yes they are not btc. But they provide the value of that ecosystem. I am triggered. Getting sick of all these idiot bitcoin snobs who dont even realize that the demand for bitcoin is in large part due to purchasing for exchange of these tokens. Sure there are scams. Scams are everywhere. Do your own due diligence.

They're a minority. Nodes are 2ay too conservative active atm.

Stop with this shitcoin nonsense. I want to see decentralized app wipe out the middle man. It levels the playing field. If it's a solid app has a user friendly ecosystem is decentralized with it's own token I think it's a great digital currency. Also these digital currencies help bitcoin do better in price because if somebody wants that token they will generally buy btc first and exchange it. Win -win. STOP WITH THE SHITCOIN NONSENSE

Hindsight is 20 /20
@_date: 2018-08-10 04:52:08
I mean... eh whatever fuck it.. bitcoin is going to be a cash cow for Corporations now. I need to get over it. Bitmain and blockstream can still go to hell
@_date: 2018-08-08 05:12:43
We all do :(
@_date: 2018-08-11 21:22:07
Fuck that. Its a free market. Calling digital currencies outside of bitcoin shit coins is a huge hypocritical statement. Grow the fuck up.
@_date: 2018-08-16 03:38:30
That was the actually point of butcoin. 5o br treated as digital cash. Like bitcoin cash zinnnng
@_date: 2018-08-14 08:33:45
Bitcoin is not broken but it sure was slow and costly when things picked up last December. In fact I remember now embarrassed I was about it.
@_date: 2018-08-11 21:15:39
The reason why btc is over 50%dominant market cap on the downside is because people are looking to exit btc yo cash. Thus btc is in more demand on the way out. This is nothing to be proud of tbh
@_date: 2018-08-08 16:34:40
Well the fact that bitcoin is in the mainstream, now the mainstream will dictate bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-09 05:10:15
I found this entertaining. People need to lighten the fuck up.
@_date: 2018-07-24 17:58:11
Litecoin and Ripple are shitcoins also
@_date: 2018-07-18 02:54:16
Let free markets decide. That's the point of bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-07-17 22:30:07
Unless bitcoins bullrun effectively handicaps the network like last December.. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 14:57:43
Meh, no matter where you go it seems you'll get gouged. In the end it's worth it but nobody likes taking a hit.

In other words people should not use them period. Bragging about arms as far as adoption is concerned is laughable 
@_date: 2018-07-22 13:43:30
People talk about banks ripping people off. This kind of thing is what turns off customers.
@_date: 2018-07-17 15:17:48
While I agree. I think CREDITS (cs) will probably take the fastest cheapest TPS. Good name. Monero from what I hear are only used by hackers who need to wash their funds after a theft. I've never heard of people using monero outside of doing something illegal. Who knows 8f btc will reign king. I will always have some though :)
@_date: 2018-07-23 05:58:47
It's not hard to find somebody to meet in person  tbh. I would never use an atm
@_date: 2018-07-17 15:18:45
This hurts. Dont fucking remind me.
@_date: 2018-07-19 14:28:34
Bitcoin atms are huge ripoffs though. Fees are higher than the banks in canada and that's hard to beat!
@_date: 2018-07-28 04:32:21
Decentralized in China maybe... lmao. Most secure based on what?
@_date: 2018-07-19 22:02:17
Spending 3k a month for rent. I'd move. FUCCKKK THAT.
