It was copypasted from somewhere.
The thing that stuck out is you calling sha for a checksum.

If i kept all the bitcoins i have bought through the years for drugpayment, i'd have enough money for a mansion, a couple of sportcars and a trophywife.

It was a while since i studied hashing functions, still a wiki read is enough to answer OPs question.
Sha is secure and wont be broken by todays means.

Read about it on wiki before you ask stupid questions.
If you have a quantum computer and can factorise extreamly large prime numbers, you would be able to break sha256 ( and all other encryption/hashing algoritms in existense).

Actually enigma machine was very secure for a long time.


Encryption and hashing fulfill different purposes..i said encryption in my post when i said most of the algorithms will be obsolete.


That was according to my professor who taught the crypto courses, and he is a pretty distinguished mathematician.
I cba anymore dude, i have stuff to do.
Good luck and hodl.

Dude, like i said i was going by memory and it was 04:00 in the morning here.
We went thoroughly once one how every AES cyckle works, how SHA works etc, unless you are a mathematician and use it  everyday some stuff could get blurred with time.
Most of encryption algorithms will be obsolete when/if quantum computers happen and that is not exegeration.
I'm a just a codemonkey myself and not a mathematician, thats why you using arguments like you using cryptos every day which make you some kinda expert stood out.
I mean, no1 will implement those alghorithms from scrath anyway, and if you code in java (like 70%+&gt; of programmers in the world) its fairly easy to use the already implemented libraries and hardly impressive.
Unless you are a mathematician working for NSA/CIA and working on  your own encryption algorithm.

Wow, butthurt much?
Only one pretending here is you.
You read a couple of mainstream magazines and act like you some kinda expert.


It means the result is just a short string of characters that can verify integrity of a much larger data set. Piracy groups commonly use CRC32 for video distributions, secure software distributions (e.g. Linux distros) use MD5 and SHA-1.
Do you even know what the fuck you are talking about?
We were discussing sha. Yes, the result you get by applying the hashing function is a string. A checksum is the result of that function. And the size of the dataset does not matter. The main application of hashing functions in real world is to store passwords..
Calling sha "basicly a checksum" makes no sense. You basicly said sha is hashstring. "lol".


wow, impressive.
Like using the already implemented java libraries? Using a hashing function, thats supposed to be hard?
That might be impressive to someone who has yet to write his/her first hello world programme..
Or are you going to claim that you implemented the hashing functions/enc algorithms yourself, in lets says c++?
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:53:01


hahah, you try way to hard.
Whats your experiemce, using the MessageDigest class in java?
Or are you going to claim that you have implemented some crypto alghs/hashing function from sctratch? :D
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:48:48
Yes, i was wrong about that.
I was writing late at night going by memory, nice misdirection attempt tho.
So what, if i dont have anything related to programming on this acc? I use stack overflow when needed since reddit is not the best place for that. 
Are you really that butthurt that you went on to browse my posting to history just to try to give yourself some validity?
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:01:51
Or you are just some retarded troll.
@_date: 2018-01-07 10:44:47
nice copypasta.
the only thing you wrote yourself above is wrong


checksum is the result you get by applying the hashing function.

Hey, hijacking your post a bit.
But whats the biggest/cheapest exchange nowdays? User identification/bank transfer is not a problem, since this time i actually plan to invest rather than buy drugs for it.
Last time i used a proper exchange was Mt Gox...

Debitcard, took me like 1 minute..
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:47:06
Yeah,i currently only have a passport as a valid form of id, so i got to look for another exchange without fees.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:39:29
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:30:01
Same thing is happening with me.
Im verified on coinbase, but it seems my passport in not enough on gdax, they want additional id card before my acc is approved.

Sepa transfers take a long time+they have a huge backlog i guess.

Most have a big gold reserve thought.
U.S dont need it thought, as long as they have the biggest military in the world and can prop up the petrodollar with regular democracy injections in thr middle east on a regular basis.
