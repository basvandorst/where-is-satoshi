You can lookup the PUBLIC address on a btc block explorer to see how much is there.  Do not reveal the private key anywhere until ready to move/spend the coins

A fork takes a copy of the Blockchain and starts operating on it with a different code base.  Forks cannot affect each other by design.

The thing to be most careful about is protecting the pk.  Because it is the same on each chain you will need to expose it multiple times.  So sweep your BTC first, then BCH then BTG then clams and any other forks.
I’m on the fence here bc I have a circa 2015 paper wallet that I need to do the same with.  I’m waffling between the risk of sweeping and keeping it all intact for future sale like a casicus coin.

You just have to move it to any wallet/address where you 100% control the private keys.  Exchanges and some online wallets hold your BTC for you in custody.  Which means they control the private keys.
Ledgers, Trezors, paper wallets, others are good options.  Just remember every time you move coins between addresses you have to pay a fee and be prepared to wait on a busy network.

The market supports it.  People are willing to pay a premium on Coinbase.  They do the same thing on the sell side.  It’s a service and a way for them to make more per transaction on top of fees.  The way you avoid it is go to GDAX and sell/buy there.

No one seems to be talking about FATCA disclosure.  Searching reddit all the FATCA posts are years old.  I haven't found anything that says FATCA doesn't apply to crypto.
FATCA requires US taxpayers to disclose the value of HOLDINGS once a threshold is met.  Which means we're required to tell the US gov't that we hold a foreign asset and its value even if we haven't executed transactions with it.
My tax advisor, who is fairly up to date on crypto currency, is advising I submit this form because this year I now meet the threshold criteria and the penalties are substantial.  I do not hold any of my coins on any exchange, though I have transacted with exchanges globally in the past.  My assets are all in cold storage which means they are held globally on the various blockchains.
What are your interpretations of FATCA?  What will you do if you are subject to the thresholds?  Because this seems a far more egregious overreach than to have crypto transactions disclosed.

You should be good to go then.  I'm in Texas too and operate heavily in coinbase without any issues.
If you are just after quick payment then he can use the coinbase sell function when he feels the price is right.  You will pay a 1.5% fee to coinbase.  There will be additional fees to consider depending upon what kind of bank transfer is selected to deposit to.
You can avoid the selling fees by utilizing GDAX(this is coinbase's trading platform) to sell.  Pretty advanced stuff here though.  You will still need to pay transfer fees.  They are all listed and in the open before you execute anything.

Maybe this will help.  You have 10 "dollars" and a ledger of how you got those dollars in a cashbox with a combo lock sitting on your desk at home. When a fork happens this cashbox is cloned so you have a second cashbox(and ledger) sitting on your desk. That cashbox has the same combo as the first BUT it has "Dillers" in it instead of dollars. Dollars and Dillers have different values based upon market demand and share the same history up until the point of clone.  That's a fork.

Except there is starting to be and will continue to be a large influx of participants in the crypto ecosystem that do not care anything about Bitcoin or its purpose.  They will never even consider the HODL concept.  They are 100% interested in making short term fiat gains.  Hedge funds, individuals, neighborhood investor groups. 
I hear them in my office and social circles.  They brag and compare on their latest fiat gains and now crypto is beginning to be a part of that conversation.  Just this week a brag about how GBTC made a 75% short term gain on a large investment.  This was from a tech illiterate person who has no idea whatsoever what crypto is nor do they care.  All they cared about was that they made 75% on their money in a very short timeframe and blew away their peers comparitively.  Crypto isn't a small ecosystem, private club of techies anymore.  The astounding monetary gains so far are blood in the water to sharks that may very well in the end destroy our beloved ecosystem.

Yes it's illegal to use someone else's resources without their permission.  Doesn't matter if it's CPU, GPU, water or power and it doesn't matter if those resources belong to a school, company or individual.

The downside is that you lock up fiat in an exchange waiting for an arbitrage play to form that may never form.  In some situations a Line of Credit is used for short term to avoid locking up capital but I doubt that's available in crypto exchanges.

Because there are thousands of copies of the ledger distributed across the world.  To change a transaction you'd have to do so in every single node instantly and that simply isn't possible.

You need the private key for each address.
So you had BTC in a core wallet on your PC.  Sometime after Aug 1 you sent those BTC to Coinbase.  So your BTC balance is 0 on the BTC chain.  But the chain was cloned to BCH on August 1 and so your send transaction didn't touch your BCH(which is in the same public/private pair because it was cloned).
Consider these directions to get your private key that would be used in BCH collection steps.
To export a private key from your Satoshi bitcoin-qt client:
launch your bitcoin client as usual and wait for it to load the blockchain and start up
click on 'help' in the menu bar (top right)
click on 'debug window'
select the 'console' tab
type: walletpassphrase "your walletpassphrase here" 600
type: dumpprivkey [your Bitcoin address here]
this will return the private key, you can copy it now; ensure you clear your clipboard/history afterwards
type: walletlock
Now you should have your public address and your private key to use in the BCH collection process.
Use caution here, I'm no expert.  Verify first.

Yes this is pretty much the only way to be successful at arbitrage.  You have to have both fiat and bitcoin available on both sides at the same time.  You buy btc on one side and immediately sell btc on the other.   In combined terms you have just netted the difference.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:23:24
GBTC represents .092 real BTC per share.  So that's roughly $18k equivalence.  By that math it's trading at a 10% premium to actual BTC.
As the other poster stated its a recognized vehicle for use in traditional investment accounts.  So those who are familiar with buying other stocks can participate in the crypto crazyness without any new training or understanding of crypto.
Honestly they don't care about the premium anyway.  They just want the gains in a vehicle they know how to buy and sell.

Please go read Satoshis paper.  It's not long and not difficult to understand.  It's all explained there.
As explained below once all reward coins are mined in the year  ~2140 the network will pay miners to maintain the network via transaction fees.  The difficulty will be a function of the hashing power available to the network to do the assigned work.

Yes!  Go look in the block explorer for each altcoin by searching your original public address to see balances.
You should do this as soon as possible and at a minimum move those coins to a new address on the respective block chain because to move your other original coins you exposed the private key which is the same for the alt coins.

@_date: 2017-12-04 15:20:45
What are you trying to accomplish here?  A test of some kind?  Don't think in terms of fiat.  Think in terms of % gain/loss.  That way it doesn't matter the value of the fiat in question and you can adjust accordingly to your situation.  Exchanges are all middlemen and middlemen are out to make money.  This means they will add their cut to transactions.  They will also set buy and sell spread just like Stock exchanges do.  You are probably looking at needing a 5-6% increase in BTC to be able to grab a profit on a fiat -&gt; BTC and BTC -&gt; fiat transaction.

Paper wallets aren't obsolete...  and they don't have to be paper, they can be stamped metal for extra protection against the elements of flood/fire.  All a paper wallet is is a Public Key and the Private key that goes with it.   Once a transaction confirms to the Public address on the blockchain that Private key is the only thing that the blockchain will accept as proof that you are the rightful owner of that address and are authorized to send its balance anywhere.  Lose that paper to fire or flood and the balance on that address is locked up because the key is gone.  Folks like to say "lost" but it's not lost they are just inaccessible.  That's also why early folks who formatted harddrives have "lost" their coins, because the only know location for the pub/priv key pair for their addresses were in that wallet.dat file.
It is the ultimate instrument allowing you to 100% protect your balance because(provided the paperwallet generator is legit) there is no third party what so ever that you would have to depend on to ensure recovery.  You will hear ppl say a hardware wallet is an option but its still a third party in the equation.  I don't discount the hardware wallets.  I have one for small balances, but I won't trust a large balance on them(see this years defcon news for the Trezor).
If you are really a long term holder then a paper wallet is probably for you, because the downside of the paperwallet is that it is a cumbersome task to sweep the balance into an online location to spend.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:06:41
There is no way to tell.  You can post the public address and we can look on a blockchain explorer to see the transaction history, but unless someone is able to prove they accidentally sent you over a $1.5m in crypto you better not believe anyone who claims they are theirs.  Hope you have the private keys.
It's also extremely difficult and rare for an accidental send to happen like this.  Addresses aren't all adjacent to each other.  So i'ma call BS on this one too unless you start dropping some screenshot proof.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:07:19
No one can or will tell you this.  You have to decide on your own when to buy and sell.  Based upon your post here I recommend that if you do want to participate in the bitcoin ecosystem, just dollar cost average by making a set purchase on a regular basis no matter the price and accumulate.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:57:14
I think this is a bit of a toss up right now.  I thought it was fifo which means when you sell any coin it comes from the oldest cost basis coins you hold.  But my tax advisor says that there is a provision in the new tax code that removes the fifo rule which means you can pick which lot you sell from, but this also means you have to keep incredible logs of what you sell and when.

The thing is, is that all the stolen BTC and crypto was taken from third parties by using the blockchain as it was designed and not from attacking the blockchain itself.  No one has modified a transaction on the bitcoin ledger and no one will.  Same reason that addresses for which the private keys have been lost will not be recoverable by attacking the address or the blockchain otherwise the entire system would lose its credibility.
There are those who are attacking the genesis coins and early addresses in an attempt to get very lucky and obtaining access.

few hours to a few days.  All depends upon how busy both the exchange you use and the Bitcoin network are when you send them across.  I sent some from Coinbase to a paperwallet a few months ago and it took about 3 hours for all confirmations to hit and the transaction to arrive.  If you want to be ultra cautious, send only a small amount to your paperwallet first to ensure you have the right addresses and to gauge the time it will take.  Then send the remainder.

I hope you are over 18.  If not you are in a bad spot.  Coinbase will happily take the coins in but you will risk getting your account frozen once they start doing id verification if you are under 18.
Coinbase has withdrawl limits so don't expect to get all this money all at once.
If you go to a meetup, do not tell anyone you have 37 coins.  Talk only like you have a very small amount.  Like .25 or .3 BTC the process will all be the same.  
Be very careful!!!  a knowledgeable person can sit down at that machine and send those coins away and you'll never know it.  Never let that PC out of your control.  Do not let anyone say let me take it for the day to work on it.  Seriously.   Shields up from this point on.

We at Coinbase couldn’t be more excited by the explosion of interest in digital currencies. The last few weeks has seen an unprecedented increase in the price of digital currencies. More people are engaging with our platform than ever and that bodes well for the future of the digital currency. At the same time, it does create extreme volatility and stress on our systems. We take this very seriously and wanted to share some important thoughts.
We’re continuing to invest heavily to scale our platform
Over the course of this year we have invested significant resources to increase trading capacity on our platform and maintain availability of our service. We have increased the size of our support team by 640% and launched phone support in September. We have also invested heavily in our infrastructure and have increased the number of transactions we are processing during peak hours by over 40x.
There may be downtime which can impact your ability to trade
Despite the sizable and ongoing increases in our technical infrastructure and engineering staff, we wanted to remind customers that access to Coinbase services may become degraded or unavailable during times of significant volatility or volume. This could result in the inability to buy or sell for periods of time. Despite ongoing increases in our support capacity, our customer support response times may be delayed, especially for requests that do not involve immediate risks to customer account security. You can read more in our Coinbase User Agreement.
Be an educated investor
We also wanted to remind customers of some of the risks associated with trading digital currency. Digital currencies are volatile and the prices can go up and down. Due to the rapidly changing price of digital currencies, some customers may not have sell limits that are sufficient relative to the value of total digital currency they are storing on Coinbase. Sell limits are one of the many measures Coinbase takes to protect client accounts and assets.
As a proactive measure, we encourage customers to check the following items on their accounts:
Ensure your email address is properly receiving all communications and notifications from Coinbase. To learn more about ensuring email delivery, please refer to this support article.
Ensure your two-factor authentication is updated and functional. If you have recently switched mobile devices, your two-factor authentication needs to be properly migrated to the new device. In addition, please migrate from SMS two factor to Google Authenticator to enhance the security on your account, if you have not already done so. To learn more about two-factor authentication, please refer to this FAQ.
Familiarize yourself with your buy and sell limits. They can be found here.
Complete any pending identity verifications. During times of significant volatility, ID verification may become degraded or unavailable. To learn more about identity verification on Coinbase, please refer to this FAQ.
Expect payments to take the maximum number of days indicated when making a deposit or withdrawal.
Stay up to date
We will continue to update customers for our website, our status page, in our apps, via email, on our blog and on Twitter.
We will keep you informed
We are committed to safety, security and transparency. We are working tirelessly to provide the best service and support but we can’t promise perfection during the periods of extraordinary demand. We will continue to do our best to keep our customers informed.
Thank you,
The Coinbase Team

Because exchanges hold your coins in custody in addresses they control which means you do not control the end to end fate of your coins.  Also means you are at the mercy of the exchange to provide you coins that result from a fork like BCH and BTG.  Anyone who held BTC at coinbase for instance on Aug 1 hasn't had access to the BCH they are entitled to and won't have access until Coinbase does the work to make it available to them.  However if you held that BTC in a wallet where you control all aspects of the private and public key pair you would have had access to the BCH on Aug 1.

By this thinking you would see it as ok for someone to walk into my home because I left my door unlocked and take anything they want.
If I were to put $1000 on my front lawn, it's still mine but unprotected and someone is going to take it.  It's not philosophical, its a moral dilemma.
If I purchase or do the necessary work to become the owner of a thing then it belongs to me.  Taking it does not make it yours regardless of how easy or difficult it is for you to do so.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:46:53
You have the opposite issue of OP.  You should get credited with BCH by coinbase.  Might still be being dished out since they just seem to have turned that on today.

Think of GDAX as the place where you control the price you are willing to buy and sell.  On CB if you want to buy or sell your only option is at the price they give you.(Which is higher than market for buy and lower than market for sell).  Then you pay the fees on top of that.  GDAX you get to say I want to buy or sell X BTC at $$$ and if the market supports it it executes.  ezpz.
Their authentication is also all integrated.  Sign into CB then type gdax.com in another tab on your browser and click the sign in button and wham you are signed into GDAX.

Just like any market there are white and black marketplaces...  You can bet the big(WHITE HAT) exchanges have already flagged any addresses or history of these and other stolen coins so they will either not accept them or they will accept and freeze them.  There are blackmarkets though that will fence these coins.  Those black markets run higher risk and probably lower capability to liquidate them.  Stealing the coins was probably the easy part.  Liquidating them will be much tougher.

Well...  IIRC the client should show you the balance as of the point it has sync'd to.  So if it shows 0 then your balance is probably zero.
Do you know what version of the client you are running?  Are you able to see any transactions in the transactions tab?  Do you know your public addresse(s)?  You can type these into a [blockchain explorer]( to view their balance right now.

There is a Schrodinger's cat concept at play here.  We cannot know if keys are lost or simply hidden away.  Coins are all on the blockchain, it's the keys to access them that get lost.  All the coins are accounted for on the blockchain.  We will never be able to know exactly how many participants there are in the ecosystem nor what percentage of coins are inaccessible because the keys are lost or destroyed.  This is by design to produce a decentralized yet completely valid system.
There are estimates of how many coins are inaccessible, but they are just that, estimates and they vary wildly.  The active supply is where the trading price comes from and the active supply is pretty small compared to the 16m coins in the ecosystem.

@_date: 2014-03-04 13:53:00
Of course it will.  Crypto currency is a living breathing entity and has been for some time.  I'd even go so far as to say the concept follows the principles of evolution at this point.  There are numerous species, they will come and go from the ecosystem but the fittest will survive.
Every concept, as it progresses from infancy to maturity, does so through a series of advances and setbacks.  Some of them major(Mt Gox/targeted hacks) doing significant harm to the population.  However in the end those setbacks drive improvements to the system leading to a stronger ecosystem.  Polar to the setbacks are advances(technical strengthening, acceptance, etc.) which often do more good than the setbacks leading to a more stable environment.
Greed is a component of every evolutionary system(read about the selfish gene).  It's a mechanism for achieving fitness over others within the population.  Being prepared to win against the selfish gene also leads to fitness without the moral complications.

I can vouch for Bit Coin Force.  Legit and excellent customer service.
Many people new to scrypt mining will try contracts prior to diving deep into their own hardware.
Contracts can be used to spec against new coins where you want a short term burst of hash while mining a coin early.

This is wild freaking west man.  The US IRS does have rules for taxation(capital gains/losses short and long term upon realization) but crypto is global and there is no governing body.  The exchanges are manipulated to some extent and they operate 24x7 globally.
I don't trade stocks, so I don't know what you mean by 3 day rule.  Crypto transactions are cleared relatively quickly in escrow and confirmed by the networks as designed.   Fees vary by exchange.  coinbase is the parent of GDAX, their trading platform.

You better seriously be careful.  If you are not of age they have cause to freeze your account.  Look in the history of the sub there are several threads where this exact thing happened.  And it doesn't matter if you turn 18 later.  If you transact against their TOS, you are at risk.
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:38:39
I'm sure the premiums they pay are a function of the assets under protection.   From this older [article]( their insurance was only against online coins which was a small percentage of held coins.
How often the true up and when I'm sure are deeply protected.  I bet that policy is crazy to read since there are no firm risk profiles backed by history.  I'm sure there are clauses/situations where the insurer won't payout.

To see your BTC paper wallet holdings go to this URL and search for your PUBLIC Address - DO NOT TYPE IN THE PRIVATE KEY from your paper wallet.  
Use this URL to see your BCH wallet holdings.
A wallet is a piece of software to manage addresses on the blockchain.  The wallet could be web-based or it could be software on your PC/MAC/Phone.  A paper wallet isn't really a wallet, it's just a piece of paper describing the address, its contents and the private keys necessary to support ownership.  Never let anyone you don't trust see those private keys, that includes webcams, phones, anything...
Read more, from your response you are not ready to take this on yet.  You risk losing your coins if done incorrectly.
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:20:54
Your BTC and BCH are on both chains at this time.  They are protected by the same private key since it was duplicated.  You can use a BTC block explorer to see your BTC balance and a BCH block explorer to see your BCH balance.  Since you haven't done anything to them they should be identical amounts of each coin(not identical value).  You do not have to do anything at this time unless you want to spend or sell either.
If you do want to get BTC and BCH out of the paper wallet you need to either utilize an exchange that will import both for you or import to local wallets.  You will provide the private key and the address to the exchange and they will import both off the separate chains to their custody on your behalf.  From here you can spend or sell them or whatever.
If you want to control the whole process you will need to download a separate BTC and separate BCH wallet and perform the import separately in each.
You could then generate new paper wallets one for BTC and one for BCH and send them there to now have separate private key and addresses for each.

I couldn't resist so I did the math.  If you'd have bought $200 of bitcoin on the 1st of the month for the last 12 months 9/1/16-8/1/17 you'd have spent $2400 and it would be worth $9,818 at today's $4150 per BTC.  That's 409% return.  This is why everybody and their dog is scrambling to get a foothold on BTC.  /past performance is not indicative of future performance...
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:05:25
First things first.  The amount you have doesn't matter because that amount has different impact to different people based upon circumstance.  If you make $6/hr then $1000 is a lot of money that could change your day to day situation, but if you make $50/hr not so much of an impact.
I have used the 10% approach to on a monthly cadence sell 10% of a high performing asset to diversify into other assets to spread risk.
I would not suggest you attempt to (day)trade into cheaper BTC.  If you believe in BTC at all -- just leave it there and come back later.  Looking at a 30d chart for BTC, if you'd tried trading at just about any point you'd be behind where you are today, and quite possibly much worse off.  This is why we hodl.
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:35:49
Are these original addresses listed somewhere?
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:21:57
That depends.  If you think BTC will continue to go higher, then $50/periodically is a great thing to do(it's a sound strategy called dollar cost averaging).  Because it doesn't matter what the price of BTC is or whether it goes up and down.
It's a simple EXCEL exercise to see what would have happened if you'd bought $50/wk in BTC over the last year.  I bet you'd be surprised how much that $50/wk would be worth today.  If you don't think BTC has a future upside why are you holding your .23 BTC?  See where I'm going here?

Nothing to do with "business expense" unless you have an actual business to transact your crypto.  If you realized a loss by selling for less than you paid then you have a capital loss(vs capital gain)  That loss can be used to offset other gains.  This is also called a wash sale and has rules so be careful with it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:38:53
This is not correct at all.  Crypto is treated as an asset and are taxed on the rules of capital gains.  If you transact in crypto then the gain or loss is realized and you must evaluate for taxes owed.  It is not based upon turning the Crypto into fiat and transferring into a bank account.  For instance buying a Trezor with BTC triggers a realization against your cost basis and if you made a gain that gain must be a part of your tax calculations.

@_date: 2017-11-27 14:34:14
of course they would.  otherwise how could you protect coins that are sitting in paper wallets not lost vs those that a key has been lost?  It seems that you might believe that "coins" actually move around from device to device as they are transferred from owner to owner.  But that is not the case.  A laptop that mined coins long ago that was lost didn't have "coins" on it.  It had the keys that represented ownership to those coins.

Isn't there an IRS form for reporting asset holdings above $10k or something. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:10:28
Sorry bro, that's not going to get you anything.  MtGox is long gone and in litigation for the next 3 decades.  Unless you know where you sent it out of MtGox you are sol.  If it was an exchange or webwallet site where they held it in custody for you and they are still operating then you'd just need to remember the site and find your credentials for the site.  If they are gone say like Vault of Satoshi(who took off with .75 of my BTC in 2014) then sorry gone.  If you had a software wallet on a PC/pone where you controlled everything including private keys and recovery seeds/phrases then you might have hope.   If you happen to come across the address you sent the coin to just go search the BTC blockchain explorer for that public address to see if there is indeed a non zero balance.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:57:49
You can still mine for BTC with GPUs.  Look up nicehash for the ultra basic get going now setup.  My 1070 makes about .0003 BTC/day.  Super simple.  There are other coins too that are GPU friendly like ETH.
On your wallet issue.  You should be able to get the latest core client, install and let it sync.  Will take a few hours/days.  Then shut it down, find the default wallet.dat file and replace it with a COPY of your original wallet.dat file.  Reopen and see what displays.  You will still need your credentials and such to move any coins.  If you know your PUBLIC addresses you can plug them into blockchain explorers to at least see what balance they have.

You need to first go see if there is BCH in the public address on a BCH block chain explorer.  There should be an identical amount of BCH in that address as there was BTC at fork.  Once you verify the BCH is there you will need a BCH compatible wallet and your private keys to import the BCH locally.  Then send it on to where ever to do whatever.

Maybe this will help.  Two scenarios 1) You have 10 "dollars" in a cashbox with a combo lock sitting on your desk at home.  When a fork happens this cashbox is cloned so you have a second cashbox sitting on your desk.  That cashbox has the same combo as the first BUT it has "dillers" in it instead of dollars.  Dollars and Dillers have different values based upon market demand.  This scenario is when you have a private wallet on your phone/desktop/paper.
2) the second scenario is where you have your coins held at an exchange or web wallet where you don't hold the keys.  This is comparable to your dollars in a bank.  You trust them to have the dollars you say they do.  But in this case if the fork occurs it's up to the webwallet or exchange to access and give those dillers to you.

If you are in the US then you need to read up on these terms.  Cost basis, long and short term capital gains and understand that selling for fiat or trading your BTC for goods triggers realization of gain or loss.  Your tax situation will also determine what you have to pay tax on.  Since you are relatively young I'll assume you are in a very low tax bracket.  You will likely not be able to use the basic 1040EZ if you realize gains.
The blogs you've read that talk about yes or no are crossing the line between letter of the law and what you might be able to get away with.  The US IRS has published their guidelines and they are well interpreted.  Tread carefully.

Does this make sense with fee structure of purchasing options?
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:19:48
You seem to not be considering that that BTC is divisible.  Being too "expensive" isn't a problem.  The volatility now is confusing for both buyers and sellers.  Buyers don't want to spend BTC because it might increase in buying power.  Sellers might want to immediately convert to fiat to protect against a reduction in value that can occur in hours.  The volatility is what worries most in transaction.  I'm in this exact boat.  I paid for a Trezor a few months ago with BTC, that BTC amount is today worth twice what it was so I effectively paid double for the Trezor.  However it could have gone the other way had BTC value dropped i'd have paid less for the device.
The other point is that I can absolutely use gold to purchase something today.  Now I'm not talking about walking into McDonalds and buying a burger, but I could walk into a car dealership with $30,000 in gold an pay for a car that we've negotiated a price of $30,000 on.  In fact there are car dealerships today that will take BTC without conversion to fiat and that's a demonstration of the end game.

ok, so my response was based upon your comment "I can say with a fair deal of confidence that it will go unnoticed." as if you intended to hide it.  I guess you got it covered.

This is a basic ROI calculation.  Has been for a long time now.  The only exception now is that you have to build in an element of BTC appreciation to your ROI.
Here's my story from 3 years ago:
Jan 2014 I jump on the bandwagon after BTC explodes the previous December.
February 2014 I buy a GPU mining rig for ~$4k.  I chose to buy the rig vs BTC at the time truthfully was because I wanted to play with the mining tech.
Ran the GPU rig for about 2 months mining altcoins direct to BTC through wafflepool.  Netted .75 BTC and some alt coins.
April '14 I sold the rig for 4.5 BTC exiting the mining experiment.
At the time I'd spent about $4300 on the rig and power and had 5.25 BTC.
When BTC was &lt;$250 for many months in 2015 I looked pretty stupid.  With BTC at $2k I'm a not so dumb.  In the end though, I still would have made more in the end by just buying the BTC to begin with.

On  It's all about addresses in the end.  A wallet can have multiple addresses.  A wallet might be hosted by a service like an exchange or may be running as a desktop client.  There is a variable fee to move btc between addresses.  If you make an analogy of your pants pockets being separate addresses then you must pay a fee to move your btc from one pocket to another.  This is off putting to many who are new to bitcoin but is a direct consequence of the anonymity of the addresses.  That fee goes to the miners to incentivize the work required to maintain the system.

Your questions sound like a reporter for an old school paper financial rag.  Bitcoin is decentralized and mostly anonymous on purpose.  There is little way to answer any of your questions with any sort of accuracy.  Some of the exchanges or online wallets who manage addresses on the behalf of their userbase might be able to but they would all vary and not be indicative of the whole ecosystem.

lol.  the noobs are so cute.
Sorry friend, you are 7+ years late for CPU/GPU mining bitcoin

Uh no.  Condensation and humidity will fry your investment.
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:56:19
don't.  Just buy BTC with the $30k instead.  Seriously look back at the last 3-4 years of history in Same story over and over again, buy the BTC instead of the mining gear and you'll come out ahead if BTC appreciates.

Exchanges are not interconnected so they have different supply and demand dynamics.

This is a horribly written article.  The fundamental content is there, but jesus what an awful execution.  Get at least one person to proof or edit the work before publishing.

nope.  just buy a bitcoin(s) and hold on.   To do any level of bitcoin mining you must buy expensive hardware(like an antminer S9 that requires special power and cooling considerations.   Quick ROI calc says you might make $1000 running it for a year after the cost of the miner and power.  That's at today's BTC price.
 If you are dead set to play with and learn about mining, then buy a short term mining contract or investigate the cloud mining operations.

If you did the mining locally on a pc, then you should search all your old drives or backups for wallet.dat, that's the file with the real info in it.
If you used online services, try to search your email history for the services you used.  Lots of them are long gone though, I lost some minimal coin to Vault of Satoshi and many of the reddit tip bots offed with alt coins.

US IRS has published rules.  You must track your gains/losses and the dates of realization.  You must also track realized gains/losses if you use the BTC to buy something directly.

It's in the exchanges best interest to be ready to handle the split and to be prepared for contingencies.  But because you will not control the private keys you will be at the exchanges mercy and timing.  I'm moving all my coins off exchanges for the split.  I want 100% control of my coins fate and to be able to import them and sell them off whichever chain I want whenever I want.
There was a realy good primer for what to do to prepare for Aug 1 sometime in the last week on here or maybe on @_date: 2017-06-05 04:03:17
Safe is a deceptive term in the wild west.  Coinbase has been reputable for me for 3 years that I've used them, but I'm not a heavey trader I just buy and hodl.  They operate in the US and your state laws/age can have a big impact on your ability to transact with them so do your research.

I would not suggest doing anything at all even remotely related to cryptocurrency with Paypal.  There are hundreds if not thousands of horror stories regarding Paypal closing accounts over crypto...

Exactly, why pay someone fees to do what you can do on your own?
I have an acquaintance(who against our groups better judgement) took the 10% early withdrawl penalty to cash in his $40k USD IRA and put it all in ETH and BTC a year ago.  Looks like a hero now, but man could he have been a zero.
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:20:04
How do you justify an NAV of 120+%?  Did you do this because you didn't want to take the 10% penalty to cash it in and just invest direct into BTC?
