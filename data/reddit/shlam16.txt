Until the day they're not. I can do this multiple times per day, every day. That 10% was only the last week, not the whole return on investment. That value is close to 50% too, and as it compounds over time due to my bankroll getting larger with every trade then it goes faster and faster.

Your username is pretty valid. I'll address all your comments here.
* Fees. Yes, 0.25%, what about it? That doesn't change ROI. Current value &gt; buy in. So, it's you who doesn't understand.
* Contradiction. Not once. Read the whole chain.
* Trading vs holding. I've answered that about 5x.

I see reading comprehension is a bit out of your grasp, but at least you've been good for a laugh. Feel free to get one last quip in if you like but I'm well and truly bored with this conversation.

As someone who has been playing the 1-2% trading game, seeing this huge spike out of nowhere hurts my heart. I could've sunk everything when it was $3600 a week ago and just sat there letting it make 25%. Instead I've been jumping in and out and only made 10%. 
I keep thinking that the bubble will burst, and I have a pit in my stomach for getting in at $4584 just now, expecting it to deflate back down to what seemed to be it's stasis ~$4300.
Edit: Got out, got my 1%, am happy. 
To anyone else who wants to say "hodl", just don't please. 
1) Not playing with life savings. 
2) Just having some fun and making some money on the side. 
3) Since my initial buy at $4200 2 weeks ago I've made far more ROI from trading than the 9% I would've made from simply hodling.

You hit on some of the better indicators in your comment above. I like to use MFI too, plus Bollinger Bands can be a neat tool. They're the main ones I leave active but then I flick between several others too.
Something that I figured out a few days in after ignoring it in the beginning is the importance of the depth chart and order book. Studying these guys intently really give you an edge. Watch the live trades and see what the money is doing, find the support/resistance walls in the order book (values that lots of people are bidding which will take big amounts of money to overcome) then just underbid them by a couple of cents. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:49:43
God you people are salty about people who can do things that you can't. Yes, if I held from the $3600 entry then I would've made more over the last week. But I started playing this game when the prices were $4200 a couple of weeks back. Had I simply held from that point I would've been up about 9%. Woopee. Instead, I've made 46% in the same timeframe. Hmm, can you possibly tell me which number is higher out of 9 and 46. I'm apparently not smart enough.
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:45:57
Well said, I didn't really feel like writing that response since he was being a condescending twat. Before diving into the game I spent a lot of time studying the market and how to use many different indicators to analyse short term swings. I ghosted it for a few days making "hypothetical" trades and proved to myself that I could do it, then I jumped in for real and haven't looked back.
I'm a total amateur when it comes to this kind of stuff, but my background is in analytical science, so analysing data and drawing conclusions is my bread and butter. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:11:51
Until they don't. 
I'm not playing with life changing money here, even if I hold and it does 1000% then I won't be retiring on it, this is more of a hobby for me. But my above statement stands though. People are blinded by the light with BTC, the astronomical growth, they think it will continue forever. But some day, some time, this growth will hit a point and never touch it again. Every minute after that point, holders lose. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:23:07


2 weeks ago I bought in at 4200. Now it is 4535. I would have made 8% by being one of the herd.
I have made 46%. The only people who have made more by holding are the people who bought in at like $2400, well before me.


Yes, we've already covered that I'm the luckiest person in the world because you can't comprehend the alternative. 
This conversation is going literally nowhere, and it is circling the drain. I'm out buddy. Thanks for your ~~condescension~~ concern, I'll remember you when I'm broke and living in a ditch. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:58:30


It's literally not. Just because you can't do it doesn't mean it's the same for everyone. In the time we've been having this banal conversation I've made yet another 1% exit, was able to correctly predict the zenith of [this spike]( and get out literally 2c from the top, before it was able to rebound.


Lol, dude, this is a really stupid thing to say. I don't know what you think I'm doing, but it's focused entirely on getting in and out of BTC. Quite literally the only way to "wipe clean out" is by buying in at the highest point it **ever** reaches, and then the entire currency tanks. That's not going to happen any time soon. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:51:18
I use Bitstamp and make limit orders, so if you can predict where you think the peaks and troughs will be with a 1% margin then you set a limit order which will buy/sell when the price even so much as touches that value. Trying to use an instant order will just screw you over.
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:25:41
4333\. Sat there staring at the 4364 wall for hours, and then after I got back from dinner the wall was gone and the price had skyrocketed. 10 minutes earlier and I would've noticed it was about to happen and got in. Sadface.
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:43:07
Sit tight for 4600.
@_date: 2017-08-30 02:36:46
I can't remember exact prices where it happened, but let's take 4000 for example. Say I bought in for 4000 and was looking to get out at 4040. I saw the prices reach that value and hit instant order, but by the time my order was accepted some whale did a dump and the price dropped to 3995 in the span of seconds. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:43:29


Not tomorrow, next hour. [Here's an example.]( It's much less of a margin than I usually like but as I said I got a bit nervous up so high and was able to correctly exit at the utter zenith after my entry. 
Yes, I know and I agree that BTC will go higher, but as I've said to several people, I'm doing this as a game. I'm bored. I don't have the bankroll to "get rich quick" so I just want to be a part of the action. As I've also said below, that marks my 84th trade in the black against one single trade in the red caused by accidentally using an instant order rather than a limit order and getting reamed by a big swing.
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:37:59


Thanks man, good to see there are some reasonable people in this sub.


Precisely, it's nothing more than confirmation bias on their part.


I had no experience either, so I spent a couple of weeks studying everything I could possibly learn about the charts. I taught myself how all of the indicators worked and which ones were better/more useful than others. I have a background in analytical science so perhaps that gives me an advantage when it comes to reading data, but I think anyone can do it if they aren't rash and ease into it.


Best of luck with all of your diversity. I'm currently playing the single currency game. If I didn't also work full time then I'd perhaps have more time to do it across multiple currencies.


Just like I said above, really dedicate the time to learn how the indicators work and spend your time practicing finding these trends on charts *before* investing any money. My default view for example is a split window, one with 1m candlesticks and Bollinger Bands to assess volatility. The other has 15m candlesticks and Ichimoku Cloud. On both I like to have MACD so I can see short term ups and downs and compare it to slightly longer term to see which way you'd expect it to continue trending. I like to also have MFI which correlates well with MACD and I find to be one of the better indicators. Beyond them I also flick between several other things like Parabolic SAR, Chandelier Exit, RSI, etc. 
In addition to all of the above, I've found that once you've determined which way a swing is about to happen, then the depth chart, order book, and live trades are the best way to predict the peaks and troughs. You can look through and see how much money is moving and in which direction, then you look for how much support/resistance there is in the order book and find a big wall which you don't think it will pass. Then you just undercut that wall by a couple of cents with a limit order and voila, you get your trade and you hit the zenith of the trend.
TL;DR - Study, a lot, until you actually fully understand what you're seeing.

I mean, I can, have, and will continue to do so assuming I don't get popped on this bubble.
My entire history of trading with bitcoin I've only taken a loss once and that was because I accidentally used an instant order rather than a limit order.
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:00:06
I'm the luckiest guy in the world, apparently. Must be gambling with a 2 headed coin, because the odds of getting 84 straight coinflips are 5E^-26 and literally nobody in history has ever gotten that lucky.
Try less salt in future, not good for your health.
@_date: 2017-08-30 02:34:49
I don't pay any tax. I pay 0.25% fees per transaction.
@_date: 2017-08-30 02:40:45
I haven't contradicted myself once. 
1. Could've been more in the last week.
2. Been doing this more than one week.
3. Had I simply held from initial buy in = 9%
4. My way, far more than 9%.


Yes the cult has definitely made their opinions clear on this. Their salt has been immense at the fact that people can successfully trade while they can't.
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:05:23
It's not luck. 
Edit: 83 trades in the black vs 1 trade in the red caused by screwing up an order as explained above.
Edit 2: 84

Trading is not holding. I have no "portfolio" of coins which I am uneducated enough to think of as stocks. Trading is about smash and grab. You get in, you get out, you make a small profit. 
Literally means nothing at all that the market cap is down for an experienced trader. Even though the overarching trend is bearish, you can see tens of 1-2% bullish corrections each day which happen quickly and then are gone. Trading on those makes money. 
The thing that holders don't understand/believe is that these can be predicted (for lack of a better word - like, you can see the early warning signs) to a degree by people experienced at analysing the data. There were times where I was taken by surprise and left holding the bag, but when that happens you simply wait for the rebound and don't panic. I've never had a negative trade (sold at a loss) in my life. Conversely I sold at a profit hundreds of times. 
I'm not here to grandstand and say I've earnt 12 Lambos. I haven't. But what I have done is maintain a profit at all times. I couldn't care less about the crash, doesn't hurt me at all.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:00:30
Ding ding ding!
Makes me laugh how much the hodl fanatics hate the traders, and how short their memories are. A couple of months ago I was trading and was very successful at it. I made a decent profit on my investment, and this triggered the herd because according to them "it was all luck" and "holding is the only way to make money". 
But the thing is, they only speak like this on a bullish trend. They see the green arrow next to their investment and think they're geniuses. But now you've got people who've taken 66% losses by holding. Wonder how many of them still want to laugh at people who can trade and make a profit regardless of the overall trend.
