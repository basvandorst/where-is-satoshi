Would you rattle off a few decent wallets?

If only I didn't buy that Butterfly Labs miner...
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:57:57
For real! I love these stories!! BITCOIN!

Any Nvidia cards coming?

Of course, the dollar will be worthless so the trillion won't get very far.
@_date: 2014-12-19 14:27:26
Noob question: Aren't there any functional Ebay-like markets for Bitcoin yet?
@_date: 2014-01-23 18:44:03
Damn, I wish I knew about this earlier. I would've waited on the GTX760 and Barebones system I ordered! 
I'll be shopping at Tigerdirect from now on!

I'm still kicking myself for buying that Butterfly Labs miner. Argh.
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:27:40
Hold... Hodl... Hodor!!
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:24:41
Of course they are.

I love me some Alan Watts! 
@_date: 2015-07-12 12:55:01
I remember buying a BFL miner.
@_date: 2017-04-04 12:59:07
Argh. PayPal apparently still does not play nice. 
@_date: 2013-06-04 19:14:53
Do we have to Pre-order while you "Research &amp; Develop" them??
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:49:43
Haha, that's me... I spent my 10 bitcoins last April on the $1200 BFL 25GH miner... just got it setup yesterday... now I'm rebuilding my "fortune", sigh. Least I have something I guess.
@_date: 2013-12-28 02:39:24
I had 10 BTC then I bought a Butterflylabs miner and now I have .6 Bitcoins... I agree, don't gamble kids.

@_date: 2013-09-30 20:03:47
