Not but for real, socializing the losses would be lawsuit-worthy given the way they advertised their wallets as being segregated from exchange-wide hacking. They'll probably end up with criminal charges even if they are too insolvent to make non-hacked users whole.  
It's also Hong Kong/Chinese law we are dealing with here - the laws are somewhat more flexible than in the West, but that means real life consequences tend to matter more than the letter of the law. A large loss, even if the exchange managers were not found at fault, could still lead to substantial prison time.

You're overlooking the criminal charges they will face by issuing BFX tokens backed by an insolvent firm. That falls under securities fraud, not bankruptcy law.

a negligible amount of BTC (.07 or so) and it was in the deposit wallet, as was my Ether. And USD. All except BTC was being used for margin lending. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:11:39
What happens to USD margin funds that were used to buy bitcoins by the borrower?

if you're smart, you'd have gotten all your money out of the exchange by now and are free to pursue legal action  against Bitfinex to recover the 36% in assets they stole (minus whatever you got for your BFX tokens if you liquidated them).

I am a US-verified customer with a BitGo wallet I was forced to create, and I exchanged my BFX Coin and everything else for Ethereum and withdrew all of it on Thursday. 90% of my pre-hack balance was in USD. 
So I can confirm that not all US customers are blocked from all withdrawals, at least as of Thursday. This problem may be limited to (1) some BitGo users and (2) users trying to withdraw USD directly.

Dear Bitfinex: 
(1) you have misappropriated funds from US citizen holders of USD and Ethereum. We were not hacked; therefore, you stole from us, even according to your TOS, which clearly states that each customer's funds are segregated from others'. I have notified the CFTC accordingly; (2) BFX Coin, as a trade-able token, is an "unregistered security" issued to US investors as per 15 US Code 77e, and therefore, your TOS is invalid as a matter of law with respect to BFX Coin. As a result, though I dumped my worthless and fraudulent BFX Coin at $0.32, you still owe me money. 
The SEC has been notified that you issued unregistered securities to US investors. The CFTC has been notified of your misappropriation of funds of ETH and USD holders. 
Pay up or enjoy getting fucked in the ass.

I'm also going to threaten your Taiwan bank with legal action until they cut you off. Until, that is, you pay up the ETH and USD investors you stole from.

This is Hong Kong. Not the US. There is no "Chapter 11." If significant amounts of people lose money, they will go to jail. That's how the law works in that part of the world.

So when's the site coming back up so we can check our balances? 
@_date: 2016-08-16 23:33:44
of course it is! Securities enforcement agencies around the world are very gracious and forgiving of honest mistakes like the ones Bitfinex has been making by the dozens. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 23:43:32
there's probably different ways of counting exchanges.  Coinbase is the  USD exchange and was 2x larger than Bitfinex even pre-hack. In total USD equivalent transactional value, Poloniex is the world's largest exchange across all crypto assets and was even pre-hack.  
@_date: 2016-08-13 16:43:21
No, it was not locked. And yes, I was 100% verified, id, address, bank setup, everything. I've been verified for a year; however, I was using Bitfinex for a bit prior to getting verified (I deposited Bitcoin). I don't know if this makes a difference. 
@_date: 2016-08-14 12:45:26
I think Bitgo was holding the keys, but I am not sure. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 23:41:28
it's worse than Mt. Gox. At least Mt. Gox admitted they were insolvent and filed for bankruptcy instead of concocting an opaque criminal conspiracy to defraud investors to cover up their fuckups (BFX Tokens). 
@_date: 2016-08-11 03:04:32
Why would the hacker do that? He/she is probably in Russia, Belarus, or some other country without extradition treaties from any BFX jurisdictions now and set for life. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 02:56:04
Anyone who can recover the coins can probably take them for himself. No point in a bounty. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:31:07
zanetackett, you said that the site would be back up for users to check their balances yesterday? What's the new ETA? 
@_date: 2016-08-13 16:40:12
For those having Synapse-Pay issues. here's what I would suggest. Convert to Crypto and withdraw to Kraken, which does have functional SynapsePay, or send it as USDT on blockchain to Poloniex where it'll be safer till you can figure something else out. Obviously this doesn't help US customers with frozen BitGo wallets, but it's a way around the Synapse Pay issue. 
@_date: 2016-08-13 16:53:01
my pre-hack balance was about $9500 USD. Perhaps this problem is only affecting larger balances? 
@_date: 2016-08-16 23:39:49
you're a Bitfinex troll account. 
Enjoy prison.

If they socialize the losses, they are going to jail most likely.  Especially if they were to socialize losses among NON BTC holders such as myself - who held USD and ETH. That would qualify as fraud, unless it was part of a court-approved restructuring plan - in which case they would still likely go to jail like the Mt. Gox people did.
