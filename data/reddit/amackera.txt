You're irrelevant too, and so is this post, and 99% of these posts that pop up every single day. I'm getting tired of these empty posts.

Uhh I didn't hear about this bitmain takeover! What's the story there?
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:22:36
Hey, nice! 
@_date: 2017-08-10 18:20:59
My gut agrees with you but we will have to see how it shakes out in reality!

My advice is to read both subreddits as well as the wealth of bitcoin related information on the web and become capable of making up your own mind on the contentious issues in the space.
There's a lot of tribalism going on, for your own sake try to rise above it.

You might be right, but it doesn't change the fact that the miners can take their hash power wherever they want. IMO it's likely that most users will follow.

That's literally the only thing this sub talks about these days.

You're totally right: it's impossible to know without a crystal ball. The economics of the situation are somewhat complex.

Off topic, but I really hate the VC worship circle jerk

That's not what we mean when we talk about scaling.

Lol, it's "Rube Goldberg" not "Rude Goldberg".

Sure, and every cash USD transaction that happens is "off-chain" by that definition too.
When you buy / sell bitcoin the exchange is just moving btc around its internal wallets (on-chain transaction), and sending you fiat currency (not a bitcoin transaction). This type of interaction doesn't need approval from the bitcoin network since it has nothing to do with bitcoin.
When we talk about off-chain scaling we're talking about side-chains that still in some way interact with the blockchain. Like lightning networks or similar. They're still using the blockchain to settle everything at the end of the day.
In the future I could totally see exchanges taking advantage of off-chain mechanisms if bitcoin moves in that direction --- but before then we are talking about very different things.

I think we're talking about "off-chain scaling", which has nothing to do with exchanges.

It's Roger Ver and Jihan manipulating the market JUST TO SPITE US! I was promised BTC would be $10,000 by now and I'M NOT HAPPY!

Thank you for sharing your completely irrelevant opinion.
@_date: 2017-07-04 21:17:33
Please explain
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:02:46
At least you can live in a house. Hard to live in a bitcoin :)

BCC removes SegWit and also increases the block size. That means it won't support Lightning Network, and it will require more disk space for users to run a full node; however, it will also make for faster confirmation times and lower fees as mentioned (at least in the short term).
Good on you for doing your research. This sub is pretty biassed, but is also pretty biassed. Hard to figure out the truth from the FUD.
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:10:51
Seems pretty confrontational to me, pretty clearly not constructive. Seems to be like you had an agenda to prove. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 15:09:02
What I'm saying is that when we talk about "off-chain scaling" we *are* talking about "second layer" and "sidechains".
@_date: 2017-07-06 16:12:35
Relax, was just pointing out a funny typo. Who says I disagree with you? I'm not the OP you were arguing with.
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:42:51
I hate to get into it, but what about the 2x HF makes it not Bitcoin? 
Legitimately not trolling, just curious for your perspective. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 21:44:43
"official" lolwut
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:01:09
Interesting stats, I'd be interested to read more. Any resources you recommend to read about the activity linked to dark market?
