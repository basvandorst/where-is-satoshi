Elon Musk cant build the Model 3 or have quality control for his Tesla's. Solar city is pretty much collapsed. Thats the bubble thats going to burst.

Paranoid? Maybe it was the aliens?

Good luck man, glad you had the foresight and it worked out in the long run.

B cash is better than BTC for transactions, the BTC Satoshi created is just a hodling tank for what?
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:41:01
But they are right, BTC isnt usable in it's current form other than a storage for FIAT.

I think the dip is starting already.

The government has controls in place in the form of a central bank to create stability, Bitcoin should not be used to over throw the banks, rather as an alternative platform if the bank does not offer a particular type of service.

Really good post, a few other items are:
understanding sizing of your positions. Aka dont put all eggs in one basket. 
Short vs long term. Whether u are in it for warren buffet style hodl, or in and out on volatility. Find the style that fit you personality and schedule.

Time to move from BTC to a coin that we can use.

Thought the orders auto cancel if the swing went over 10%?
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:05:27
That process takes about 6-7 business days for me.

Just try to buy at the dip, corrections are played as a part of human psychology. As for Bitcoin, the end should be much higher, so you are not in a bad place at all. Etf coming too.

And back to normal.

hahahaha Funny. I do a small amount in Bitcoin, most in S&amp;P 500 index vanguard, and some in Oil production in anticipation for the Aramco IPO.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:43:18
When's the dip? :)

Write about the flaws in Bitcoin as a currency and what changes the Bitcoin Core Dev's needs to do to make it useful once again to compete against all the new comers.
