"Bitcoin Knots (until recently known as Bitcoin LJR) is a Bitcoin Core fork maintained by Luke Dashjr, and was launched in 2011. The name is a nod to the biblical passage in which Jesus expels the money changers from the Temple with a whip of knots (Dashjr is Catholic), and also refers to merging code."

It kind of rubs me the wrong way how you're advertising your own fork in response to a question like this, in a support thread. It just *seems* wrong, I don't think I'm the only one who will react this way - just thought I'd bring your attention to this in case it didn't cross your mind.
On top of that, the name having a biblical/religious connotation is just sad. This is tech, keep religion out of it, even if it's just a name.

I think this is a consideration a lot of people don't make when discussing the benefits of accepting bitcoin.
Although, to play devil's advocate; We don't know how many(if any at all) people buy from someone else because they have a negative view of bitcoin and don't want to be associated with it or anyone else who is.

No. Creating content does not automatically entitle you to get any form of payment for that content (ad revenues or otherwise.) Putting that content up in a public place also means that anyone is free to copy this content as they see fit, without you being able to do anything about it. (copying is _NOT_ stealing, not per definition nor in practice.)

In a vacuum miners benefit the most from not including any transactions into blocks - but they do, because a healthy bitcoin network benefits miners too. There's competing incentives, and "keeping bitcoin healthy" has been winning out since the inception of bitcoin, no reason to think it won't continue to win out. You lack deeper understanding of the problem and are only looking at specific issues without considering the whole, which leads you to the wrong conclusion of the issue as a whole.

In the short term larger blocks would reduce total fees(by getting rid of the fee market), not increase them (in the long term there's a lot of effects to consider though, like increased userbase/price.)
The only real point to fees is as an anti-"spam" measure. Technically the network would survive for many, MANY more years, even with absolutely ZERO fees for 100% of transactions, simply supporting miners via block rewards(since bitcoin price will increase as more users join - and if it doesn't grow the point is moot anyways - since then bitcoin would be for most intents and purposes a failure.) Obviously I'm only saying this to make a point - not arguing for hardcoded 0 fees since that would just mean anyone could DoS the whole network at any point with "spam" transactions.
Bitcoin should be a users market, not a miners market - the overall value of the network (to humanity as a whole) is higher with the lowest possible fees(yes, I know that miner reward is fairly 1:1 related to network security - this is a moot point for decades to come, assuming the bitcoin price actually goes up - and again if it doesn't, it doesn't matter since bitcoin would be *practically* dead.)

Yes, if everything was perfectly optimized within current limitations we'd get a few more % of room in blocks, but the demand is/will be orders of magnitude higher.
It's irrelevant and pointless to even bring up. For all practical purposes blocks are _full_ quite often (not always, but reliability is desired, so again, in practice that means blocks are _full_. Saying anything else, while technically correct, is intellectually dishonest and bordering on intentionally misleading.)
@_date: 2016-06-17 09:26:24
I agree with most of what you say, and your general point, but disagree on the risk assessment, what qualifies as "hitting the limit", what is an acceptable fee and what to prioritize.
SegWit won't do anything for at the very least 1 year, more likely 2-3 - it's great tech, but for solving the current issues it's completely irrelevant. We should scale in some other way before then or the risk of being replaced becomes way too big.
Honestly I'm tired of talking and reading about this, I've spent thousands of hours reading about bitcoin and listening to discussions/talks over the past 5 years - my mind is completely made up regarding the bigger points/broader issues and I'd be very suprised if I were to change my mind, so discussing and/or arguing about this is kind of a waste of time for me. Not really sure why I'm even here any more, I just get frustrated at stupidity, lies and political agendas. Ohwell.

@_date: 2016-06-17 05:07:39
Even ignoring both sides of the argument, this is some really flawed logic being used, and people gobble it up because it confirms their own wants (of what bitcoin should be.)
Using "there's no point in improving capacity because it'd just be used up right away" as an argument is dumb, and trying to work around that logical flaw by at the same time saying "for a penny a piece" and implying that the extra transactions that would now have room would be "non-legitimate" is at best dishonest and at worst intentionally misleading. Increasing capacity doesn't mean lowered price unless demand also doesn't grow by the same amount - right now a lot of people would argue that the bitcoin blockchain couldn't even support a simple "buy once and hold" approach by a lot of user if we were to enter another "bubble phase".
The bitcoin network is a _TERRIBLE_ place to store the kind of information you talk about (stock trades, invoices, medical records, etc), even if the blocksize was increased substantially, and no they wouldn't store it there - they might THINK they want to do that, but they wouldn't end up doing it because there are superior solutions for that kind of stuff already, more advanced ones on the way, and even more solutions in the future that noone has even thought of yet. Dumb argument.
The bitcoin network certainly doesn't "need to be protected", that's the whole fucking point of it! (open network, anyone allowed to use it/innovate with it without anyone else being able to say that their use isn't "legitimate".)
This is like beating a dead horse but the "But..a bug in bitcoin, or a network vulnerability, could lead to a loss of 12 billion dollars worth of value!" argument has a doom and gloom counter-point too, a bitcoin that isn't ready for mainstream and can't support the network effect if/when it were to take off is as good as dead. There's loads of other similar arguments too. Bitcoin will continue changing, there's always a risk of a bug/vulnerability - just look at the complexity of segwit (not using that as an argument against it, simply pointing out the cherrypicking of arguments.)
I believe the only remaining _major_ risk to the future of bitcoin is stagnation.
Personally I'm quite worried about scaling. A small/niche bitcoin is nearly useless when compared to what it can be, and in the tech world if you don't provide what the users want you quickly fade into obscurity - bitcoin seemingly isn't anywhere near that point now, but that point can VERY quickly sneak up on us.
It's painfully obvious to any even remotely tech savvy person that the argument about blocksize isn't an argument about technical limitations or decentralization any more(for 2/4/8mb) - the core developers have no better insights on it than anyone else(since their expertise is useless in this case), it's all political and anyone telling you different has an agenda, or doesn't know what they're talking about - it really is that simple.

I don't have any interest in arguing this for the 100th time (we'll simply see what happens in a week or so), but I'll just leave this one basic and easy argument to support my earlier point: it's an *upgrade* that is *supposed* to "kill off" the old chain when the hf is triggered, the goal with the segwit2x proposal was to simply upgrade bitcoin, not to create 2 chains.

I'm not entering into this discussion on your terms, I'm very confident in my own education, world view and opinions on gender equality/gender issues, and I've dedicated a large part of my life to it, actively working with politics (left-wing, with a focus on feminism) for 19 years, since I was 13.
You will not change my views in any way, you don't hold any insight that I don't hold that would change my mind in any way (I know this because I know your type, however haughty that may sound.)
I'm simply responding out of frustration of seeing someone like you act all high and mighty, you don't get to do that when your world views are so clearly warped and unpleasant.


That's not how proper communication/discussion works. That's how being an entitled asshole works. I judge you on the things you say, and the things you don't say. What you choose to comment *on* says just as much about your personal views on things as the actual things you *say*.


Communicating well isn't a competition to see who can obfuscate language the most, it's about trying to make yourself understood, and showing that you understand what the other party is saying. It just happens that I understand perfectly what you're trying to say, but I laugh both at your clunky r/iamverysmart way of saying it, and the point you're making.


That's literally the opposite of what I'm saying. I'm saying that you're judging based on generalizations of groups, rather than looking at the individual. Or are you trying to argue that there's a point to sexism/racism because "stereotypes are sometimes true"? I hope I'm just misunderstanding you here.


This is a terrible argument, even assuming it were true (I disagree, but that's besides the point.) As an analogy, not conducting human experiments like Josef Mengele also arguably "impedes development", that doesn't mean we should do it.
You mean a specific thing with your *very* general comment that by itself is at best meaningless and at worst says that you think the ends justify the means, then go on to say that you mean a specific thing, and that if *I* don't get what you mean that I'm the one who failed... That leads me to my next point:


It's always your failure if you haven't made yourself understood. Doesn't matter if you're talking to someone much more knowledgeable/educated on the subject or much less. You're obviously one of those people who still feels the need to *appear* smart and knowledgeable, mainly by using overly complicated language - you aren't writing a white-paper or essay here. You need to know *when* using a more descriptive/complicated word is appropriate, and doing it just to try and belittle someone or to appear intelligent at the cost of brevity is not something to strive for.
If you feel like responding to this that's fine, but I won't be engaging in any more discussion with you, since it's literally a waste of my time. I simply needed to point out a few logical fallacies and issues with your comments to other people, you yourself are already a lost cause, and your views are quite scary, in a "I worry for the state of humanity" kind of way.

@_date: 2017-09-28 21:38:30


I completely agree, I just think we have at least slightly different ideas of where to draw the arbitrary line of how much we value focusing on adoption vs other things (although, I'd argue we can easily do both right now, a 2-8x blocksize increase can EASILY be supported by the network at no noticeable decentralization cost, all actual research into it that I've read supports this view, and this is my personal opinion. It's fine if you disagree but you can not change my mind on this without *substantial* evidence, I've spend several hundreds of hours on this and I'm very confident in my assessment.)


That has nothing to do with 2x, and more to do with some supporters of 2x (mostly because of frustration with core, I suspect.) It certainly isn't any part of why I want 2x, I don't want to "get rid of core." (I just wouldn't lie awake at night and cry about it if it did somehow end up happening, some devs would continue, and others would join to take the place of those who left, this is OSS, I trust in that model, I've been around since the first few years of Linux etc, I'm not worried.)
I don't want to get rid of Core (although I think it would be best if we got rid of some of the devs that I personally disagree with on such a basic level that I'm certain they will never work towards making bitcoin want I want it to be, mainly luke (he's an absolute nutcase, and technology *ISN'T* apolitical), and to a lesser degree greg, but really that's besides the point, that has *nothing* to do with why I want 2x.)


Let me then ask you why core don't just say "fine, we'll increase the damn blocksize limit, we don't think it's priority  right now but since it's obviously splitting the community and causing WAY more harm this way than a 2x increase could ever even theoretically do, let's just get it over with so we can put this behind us."? This is really what baffles me, and makes me certain there are other motives at play, and I get really put off by that kind of authority, and on principle alone makes me *very* suspicious/cautious, basically it turns me into a contrarian. :)


This isn't actually true (not that I'm against off-chain scaling, but just saying. I take issue with these kind of arguments, it's the same argument people used about the internet back in the day, "it can never scale" - yes, it can, and it will.)




Very true, and I don't think 2x is even close to an optimal solution, I just think we're in such a desperate spot right now that it's better than nothing and has no real cost, so just do it to give us a tiny bit of breathing room, it's better than doing nothing, and it's already locked-in and on the way, it was supposed to be over with already. (Some dynamic scaling option would be better if it could be implemented safely, and that's something I'm not 100% sure can be done without opening plausible attack vectors (I know there will always be theoretical ones, but a 51% attack is also a theoretical attack and I'm not really worried about that either), I don't feel like I know enough at this point to be strongly for or against, although I'm leaning towards being slightly more for it than against it if I *had* to choose one or the other *right now*, again, just because we're in a desperate situation right now.)


I consider this only a theoretical threat, one that would completely disappear if core supported it from the start and didn't start a childish campaign against it, intentionally splitting the community. It's a theoretical threat of our own making. This is obviously a bad argument if it weren't for the "*theoretical*" part of it, but I don't consider that threat of being bigger than the long-term threat to bitcoin if we don't actually catch up on scaling *right now* (or, optimally, 2 years ago.)
I know we view things differently, we have slightly different visions of bitcoin, and that's fine. I'm simply just explaining my reasoning and my views, I'm not even trying to convince you that I'm "right." Honestly I'm so fucking frustrated and tired of this whole thing I can't wait for it to be resolved one way or the other. No matter what cryptocurrencies are here to stay, I just really want bitcoin to remain the "main" one.

If you worry about "miners being in control"(paraphrasing) then you don't understand bitcoin. That's the whole idea behind it, that's the main breakthrough/innovation Satoshi had, that's what solved the decentralization problem. If instead you actually meant that you're worried about miner centralization all I can say is that it's a theoretical issue that is *VERY* unlikely to be an actual issue, Bitcoin is anti-fragile.

That we can agree on at least.
On everything else you're either wrong, cherry-picked extremely rare situations based on fucked up laws (they do exist, but if you want to get into that, I think women win out on the most number of fucked up unfavourable laws, I doubt you want to go there), or you're grossly oversimplifying.
I'm not here to argue specific fucked up laws with you. I'm simply stating the fact that we live in a patriarchal society dominated by men, that's designed for men, by men. You pointing out one or two situations where men can also get fucked by the law does nothing to change that.

You really should work out your issues with women (and probably the world, let me guess you have an issue with Muslims/immigration/black people too?)
I have a really useful tip for people like you. If you ever find yourself wondering if something you're saying about women is sexist and/or misogynist, try replacing the word "woman" with "black" and the word "man" with "white", and then see if you think the comment is racist or not, like this: "Black people have an entirely different kind of intelligence than white people."

No, I don't know who StopAndDecrypt is, but after quickly googling it and seeing the [NO2X] tag, I have a pretty good idea. :)
Don't get me wrong, I'm for the 2x fork, but if it doesn't work out I'll still believe in bitcoin and all that, I just prefer to see Bitcoin go in the direction I think is overall best (which is on-chain scaling), but if it doesn't happen I still think Bitcoin is better than the alternatives (just not as good as it *could* be IMO.)
@_date: 2017-09-26 09:50:20


I also own bitcoins, and I've been interested/invested since 2011 (as if that matters in any way?). I don't run a full node because there's absolutely no reason for a normal user to do so. I'm willing to interact with whatever is "bitcoin", including segwit and all other future upgrades, but I'll be very disappointed by the harm to adoption caused by refusing to scale fast enough if 2x (or some similar block size increase hardfork) doesn't happen very soon (although there has already been significant damage.)
Bitcoin will survive no matter what, but it certainly isn't the vision I signed on for back in 2011, but I still hope that we'll get back to sane transaction fees so that we can actually use it as a currency/money and not "only" the other cool token stuff. There's absolutely no reason bitcoin can't scale fast enough to keep up with growth, other than political agendas that are misaligned with my own (which is benefiting humanity as a whole as well as possible - which will also benefit me.) This is why I don't like the way we're heading right now, there's lunatics (luke, greg etc) and corporations with WAY too much influence, and it's really sad to see, but bitcoin will still survive, adoption will just slow down.
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:11:54
What are you talking about? That makes no sense. People running a node are simply contributing to a general consensus of rules to follow, affected by, and affecting the other parts of the ecosystem (miners, exchanges, devs, etc.) 1 individual node could not possibly matter less.

I know that a large majority of people here are sexist, that's a fact, but he knew the rules before he got married and agreed to those terms, now he wants to back out of it, guess most people in r/bitcoin really doesn't like upholding agreements (NYA), lol.
A bit more on point: I agree that marriage is an archaic system that's "broken", but if anything it's biased in favour of men, just like all of society. If you decide to merge your economy with another person it'd be pretty fucking unfair if the only person being economically protected in case it end up not working out is the man, because of inherent inequalities in society often happens to be the one with higher salary, while the woman works 24/7 at home, cleaning, making food, taking care of kids etc (on average)... But I guess you think that work has no value and the man has a "right" to all the money he earned while being taken care of by the woman? If both of you agree that the laws regarding divorce are wrong, you can always enter into a prenup, the simple fact is that this guy agreed to something, and you're now trying to tell him he should cheat and steal to get out of it. The cognitive dissonance is strong in this one.
Every time a subject like this comes up and you see all the sexist and misogynistic comments in here it makes me feel embarrassed about this community.

Your comment doesn't have much to do with what I was saying, maybe try re-reading my post? But to answer your comment about BCH: there has been plenty of bitcoin forks, just like BCH is (with changes to blocksize, addition of EDA, etc.) BCH just happened to for some time gain a higher amount of hash power than other forks, but other than that there's not really anything special about that specific Bitcoin fork. If BCH ever gets a longer chain that is valid and has more cumulative POW then it would indeed become bitcoin, after a certain amount of time, but in this case miners, and the rest of the market has decided that BCH is *not* Bitcoin (at least not for now.) Quite simple.
@_date: 2017-10-25 07:32:58


Silly slippery slope argument. It simply wouldn't happen because miners know that they would lose money on it, both in the short- and long-term. You know full well that bitcoin is already at its core built on the idea that miners will act in their self-interest, they have had 8+ years to fork and reward themselves 1000+ BTC per block, or increase the 21M cap, or whatever - but they don't, and this is the assumption that makes the system work at all to begin with, this hasn't changed. Bitcoin works, as the upcoming fork will prove.


Things don't exist in a vacuum, if miners tried something like this there would be system-wide repercussions and reactions from users/exchanges/companies. Let's assume what you say is right, the miners fork to benefit only themselves by increasing block rewards, you'd instantly have the rest of the space take actions against them (miners know this, and *YOU* know this), and in this example you'd just have coinbase and gemeni make amendments/put in exceptions to the statement "we'll follow hashpower" and refuse to call that forked chain "bitcoin" anymore (or even list it, most likely.)

No thanks needed (but I appreciate that I might at least be a tiny part of the solution and show that there isn't only that kind of crap in here.) I'm just happy to not *only* be getting hateful responses back when I make comments like this myself, so thank you! :)


Yeah, I really don't envy being a woman in this space. I have no idea how long it'll take to improve noticeably but at least there has been some improvement (in general gender equality has has had pretty slow progress the past 20 years.) 


What the actual fuck.. Good that you got away from that shit.


I do think as cryptocurrencies become a bigger part of all aspects of our world that this improvement will accelerate as more women will start entering the space (because it'll just be such a big part of everyday life), and this in turn will bring more women into other areas of tech as well, I believe.


Yeah, how that part of the system works is truly sickening, especially after you see people go on about how favoured women are in the eyes of the law, that's just like rubbing salt in the wound, truly infuriating.




I've basically given up on trying to correct stupid people/opinions online, I've become quite jaded over the years, but whenever I see something especially infuriating (sexist/racist/misogynistic) in here I just can't help myself and end up at least pointing it out and calling people out on their backwards world views. So even though I'm a guy, I can sympathize with the backlash of that and can imagine some of how it must be just being a woman here, no matter your opinion (and holy crap if you happen to be *both* a feminist and a woman, people just go insane, that's when you get to see the truly disturbing misogynistic comments!) I've had A LOT of heavily downvoted posts because of it in the past. :)

It was an appropriate analogy. An analogy doesn't have to be literally correct you know. I'm not saying that miners are *exactly* like a government (but they do share some similarities.) Also, what does Jihan have to do with anything I said? I wonder who has the "agenda" here.


My "agenda"? My only agenda is correcting misinformation while wasting 2 minutes of time when I'm bored and happen to see something particularly stupid/wrong being said.  Or was that simply a flawed way to negate my opinion via some logical fallacy that I'm a "shill", because you happen to have seen a comment I made that you disagree with?

The reason I didn't provide any counterarguments is because it has all been argued ad nauseam, everything that can be said has been said (I've been in the space since late 2009, and financially involved since early 2011.) At this point I'm just frustrated with stupidity, hidden agendas and FUD and sometimes can't keep myself from pressing "reply", even though I should.
We know for a fact that a 2 or even 8mb blocksize won't cause any centralization problems at all, arguing with that will simply make me consider you as having an agenda, or franky, being dumb. It has been shown over and over again (ignoring the mad rantings of people like Luke-jr.)
"From now on, blocks will always be full" is at best a gross oversimplification aswell; today's "normal" usage wouldn't even fill 2mb immediately. Of course usage would start growing (quickly) again if we were to raise the limit, after being artificially restrained for so long(which is why segwit alone is too little, too late), but would eventually even out and keep up pace with technological improvements (both software and hardware) - sure people could start spamming, fill up blocks and start pushing transaction fees up a few cents until they run out of money (which they will), or they simply wouldn't bother in the first place because it'd cost so much money to even fill up 4mb blocks. People either wouldn't bother, or very quickly stop, causing a cyclical transaction fee. The higher the ceiling, the less impact spammers would/could have.
This is all just so incredibly repetitive, I'm getting tired of the same constant misinformation. It has all been said, all the information needed is out there for anyone to find for themselves to form a decently unbiased view (although it's a jungle of misinformation and FUD, from all sides... But the information is out there.)
I suspect that you already know this. You're incredibly intellectually dishonest, and I say that based on many years of reading your online comments. I really don't care to argue with you though, I know enough about you to avoid that, it won't lead to anything but logical fallacies coming out of you. Sorry to be so personal about it, but at this point I'm just too damn tired of all of this. And no, this isn't ad hominem, because it's talking about character traits directly relevant to my point. I'm tired of watching people like you stall bitcoins development because you want it to become something that benefits the few rather than the many. But hey, at least you're nowhere near as totally batshit insane as Luke-jr (both personally and within the bitcoin space.)

Inaccurate bullshit. Gavin himself changed his mind on the 20mb limit after additional testing and ended up going with a much lower suggestion. You're building straw men.
But let's just say that we implemented a 20mb blocksize cap, and ended up filling those blocks like you suggest we would(which is also a flawed assumption, I hope you understand why), that means that we're now only doing 1/20th of the number of transactions we WOULD be doing had we actually increased the blocksize - and this would obviously be a good thing.

You don't take control of the interview, you take a very long time to make any point. You were on the "defense" throughout the whole interview which to the layperson makes it seem like you're "losing" the argument, since they don't know that a majority of the interview questions were FUD/myths/flawed.
This was a "hostile" interview, and you didn't treat it as such, you needed to really squash some of those flawed leading questions much harder than you did. I think if you were a bit more offensive, I wouldn't have had as many issues with this talk.

I misunderstood then, 2% seems more realistic (albeit still probably quite low for a 20 hop route in a real world scenario, but at least it's in the ballpark.)
In this "spherical bitcoins in a vacuum" example where every channel has the same amount of bitcoins to start with, and only tiny(maximum "a few dollars" maximum) transactions sizes the 2% number might be a good guess, I just think as you start simulating closer to real world distributions you'd run into degradation issues (bottlenecking), causing inconsistent routing.
We've got to keep in mind that the real world scenario of connectivity between users/nodes won't look anything like the example used in this "simulation."
Don't get me wrong, I think the LN is some really interesting tech (mainly for micro/nanopayments), but it certainly isn't *the* solution to scaling issues, and it irks me that it's being touted as such. :/ (but it might be *part* of the solution)
@_date: 2016-05-17 14:15:10
This is such an incredibly flawed argument, in so many ways. If the max blocksize were to increase it does not mean the blocks would get larger without someone actually utilizing this space by filling it with more valid transactions. At this point I've given up on this whole debate, no matter what happens I'm sure bitcoin will survive - I just happen to think that keeping the max blocksize at 1mb could potentially be a disaster that causes the next wave of bitcoin hype to die out before it even gets going.
If we were to get a huge price increase right now (considering the extra users that would bring) the network would NOT be able to keep up - not saying bitcoin would die if this were to happen, but it'd be set back 1+ years at the very least because of the media shitstorm alone.
The network could already support a 4mb blocksize easily (anyone telling you different, no matter who, is either mistaken, lying or has another agenda.) The devs just happen to have taken another route with other performance improvements first. Hopefully we don't get punished by taking this "greedy" route of waiting and hoping segwit will be enough until LN and the other improvements gets implemented. I'm sure things will work out for bitcoin in the end, I just don't agree with the route we're on even though I mostly agree on the "destination" Core has set. Just to clarify, I'm AGAINST a fee market while the block reward is still relevant(and even after, I believe there will be other interests driving miners). It's not needed for/by the network.

TA is ofc nonsense (maybe a tiiiiny bit of psychology reflected in some of it, so it is technically slightly better than just pure chance, but yeah, nothing to bet money on, unless you're loaded, since the variance is enormous, assuming you even have a 1% edge on random chance.)
What isn't nonsense though, is the general ~4 year cycle bitcoin goes through (~3 years bull market, ~1 year bear market, give or take ~6-12 months.)
This isn't information you can day trade on, but you can certainly hold/sell within ~50% of ATH on it.
Check out this vid talking about it if you feel like it, worthwhile info IMO: [

I don't feel like arguing semantics, if you don't agree with my reasoning I welcome you to make an actual argument that isn't intended simply to derail.
I suspect you're trying to imply some semantic technicality based on a racist point of view, but maybe you can prove me wrong by explaining what you actually meant by this.

As I said, you've clearly not been in the space long. There's loads of quotes from satoshi about minimal/no fees, the code *LITERALLY* had free transactions (priority based on coin age) for the first handful of years, until it was removed. Bitcoin was always advertised as global, "free or nearly free", censorship resistant internet money. Instantaneous and free transactions was the first selling point you'd make to people when talking about bitcoin in the early days. (For example, look up some old Andreas Antonopoulos vids and you'll notice him saying it multiple times per video.)
Satoshi simply viewed fees/blocksize limit as an anti-spam measure (never ever intending us to hit that blocksize limit), and many decades in the future - after block rewards are (nearly) gone - as an incentive for miners to secure the chain, nothing more.
I could go on, but I suspect I'm wasting my time.
If you don't believe any/some of this, feel free to look it up yourself.
And yes, I know what "literally" means, and while I *did* use it in its "original" meaning, using "literally" as emphasis is also completely acceptable ('Literally' can be used for emphasis while not being literally true. Go look it up.)
Man, you must feel dumb? Every single thing you wrote was wrong. Heh.

Seems to me like it's you who's trolling/arguing for no reason here, not me. This comment of yours seems a bit ironic to me. :)
This argument is over, you're just a troll, just as I suspected from your earlier comment. I'd love it if you replied to me again to really prove that you're a troll though - but I won't respond to you. Have a nice day.
p.s. Next time, respond with a counter-argument rather than resorting to personal insults and other fallacies, this way people might take you serious for once.

First of all, if we're being technical here; simply adding data to a HD does not cause fragmentation. Deleting/overwriting files does.
Second; Most modern filesystems have very good fragmentation handling and are pratically immune to fragmentation, and even turn fragmentation into a positive (moving frequently accessed fragmented data to more optimal platter locations on-the-fly.)
Sadly NTFS is a -terrible- filesystem and can indeed get a noticable performance hit from fragmentation(mainly on large sequential reads), but luckily most people should have an SSD at this point, especially if they're stuck using NTFS.
If you have a SSD rather than a HDD the point is obviously moot, since SSD's don't care about fragmentation. (Fragmentation doesn't noticably slow down SSD's because an SSD doesn't really care if it has to read from a lot of different blocks on the disk, like a mechanical HDD with spinning platters does. (SSD avg latency is several orders of magnitude lower than HDD))
I oversimplified some things, there are some exceptions. Tried to keep it simple. (So please no comments on how SSD's aren't truly _immune_ to fragmentation etc. :)

The assumptions made in this simulation are really far away from the real world scenario though (even distribution of bitcoin per user/channel, and a uniform layout of routes between users, in the real world the topology would look nothing like that, there would be bottlenecks.)
And even under these perfectly *ideal* circumstances there's still some worrying limitations in scaling. For example, the assumption that a route will only fail 0.1% of the time, that feels like an *incredibly* low guess, I'd expect closer to 1-5% chance of failure (but admittedly that's just a somewhat qualified guess, I could be wildly off with that number.)
I'd be very interested in seeing another attempt at trying to model a real world node topology with less optimistic assumptions.

Even though it doesn't truly matter, and we should make decisions based on facts rather than authority, the article is a bit dishonest(by omission) when it says "This blocksize cap was implemented by Satoshi Nakamoto himself, as a means of preventing a particular denial-of-service attack on the network." - while technically correct it leaves out the fact that this was intended to be a very temporary solution, and that satoshi never intended for bitcoin not to scale on-chain.
Oh, and the rest of the article is basically just a bunch of personal attacks, populism and twisting facts. This is completely ignoring taking sides in the debate.

Well, it has certainly changed. The rest is subjective I think, but personally I rather enjoy it.


I can see that, and I understand. All I can say is that I like it.


I think the easy way out would be to finish the show in exactly the same style as previous seasons. I think you're in the majority and I'm in the minority here.


I certainly didn't feel like that, but I can absolutely understand people who do. I kind of wish they just made twice the episodes in this season to have a little bit more time to clear everything up, but I still prefer it as it is compared to what I expected based on the previous seasons. I don't think it is perfect like this, but I'd personally take this over what I expected to get (more of the same, with a vague ending.)

Offtopic: Why? She's like the strongest fighter of all of the main characters in the "universe", well, except the dragons... So it makes sense she got the kill right? Unless you wanted the dragons and/or random hordes of no-name soldiers to get the kill? I really don't get most of the hate on the latest GoT season... Yes, it's moving fast, but personally all I'm feeling is "FINALLY SOMETHING HAPPENS" without it taking 3 episodes for a small plot advancement.

I admit that I'm not a huge lore buff, honestly I'm horrible at the lore. I just watch because I like the show, and I do keep up (but I don't spend a lot of free time on fan sites, and I haven't read the books.)
So take what I say as something said by someone not "burdened" by the lore, but as someone talking about the series more as a loooooong movie without knowing any "spoilers" beforehand.
I'm sure there's inconsistencies, but I don't care too much. Yeah, I really disliked the very dark war scenes just like almost everyone else, but the increased pace of the story makes the show better for me personally (even if the "quality" is lower, I always disliked how slow the show was, even if I liked the show itself.)
I understand the criticism, but I just don't care as much about that part as other parts (and I'm obviously, judging by online reviews/sentiment in the small minority.)

Advice from random internet stranger (albeit with many years of experience, but noone can predict the price.): Wait. The likelihood that the price won't ever again drop below $2900 is very low IMO. Of course we could also shoot past $4k and never go below that again, but that would very much surprise me.
The worst time to buy is usually when there's a frenzy, like now.
Edit: Don't get me wrong, I'm bullish on bitcoin long-term, but I certainly wouldn't buy right now. If you bought, great, good for you, I hope it works out. You don't need to respond/PM me about how I'm wrong to make yourself feel better.
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:41:35
Actually, the advice I gave right here has value. I suggested caution during a buying frenzy - that's common sense to anyone who has even a tiny bit of experience with the trends/history of bitcoin and should be valuable to a new user.

No, I think it's very clear to any sensible and intelligent person what constitutes racism, so instead I ask *you* to give your definition of racism. If you don't think that comment qualifies, *your* definition of it must be very... questionable, to say the least.

The issue isn't that people would be willing to pay $100 fees, I'm sure they would. The problem is that they won't have to, since there will be other cryptocurrencies without these high fees that will simply make bitcoin irrelevant given enough time. First mover advantage only holds for so long, I truly hope we've sorted out the scaling issues before it's too late.

It isn't 100% safe, no one is claiming anything is 100% safe. Doing nothing is orders of magnitude more dangerous to bitcoin than hard forking to increase capacity. And it's safer than segwit.
Although, I'm personally at the point where I'd gladly take segwit at the same time to get a bigger block size increase than just a HF to 2mb, since I think a HF to more than 2-4mb would be politically impossible,  I'm willing to compromise about pretty much anything because I'm convinced that if we do nothing for another year or two bitcoin will be permanently crippled and will have lost its network effect. Pretty much anything is better than that, so.
I'm personally convinced that the complete removal of the blocksize limit would be best for bitcoin, but that isn't politically viable either, so why even bother pushing for it? We need practical solutions now.
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:53:44
Pace of innovation only accelerates, they will take lessons from bitcoin that will help them mature way faster than bitcoin itself did. You underestimate how quickly things can change in the tech field. Sure, some/most of them will fail, but one of the remaining ones will very quickly threaten to make bitcoin literally irrelevant (when the exodus begins it'll end VERY quickly.)
This is an existential crisis for bitcoin, maybe not this year, but if things don't start to look up next year I think we're in deep trouble.

This is a fantasy show, there's dragons ffs. She's as strong as she is made out to be in the show, period.


Ok. I mean I get your argument, and that you don't like the way they did it, but this isn't some glaring plot hole, rather a direction you personally didn't want the plot to go, right? While I don't mind the direction at all, so I guess we just disagree here, no objective truth in this so I'll just leave it at that.


Personally I just interpreted that as simple hubris on his part. I actually loved how abrupt it was, felt like a fresh breath of air compared to 99% of other series being so predictable. Sometimes the bad guy can just die early because he fucked up, I don't think that's bad, but I can see how someone who wanted something else would.


Here you lost me. This is a show where dragons and mystical forces exist. Arguing about real-world issues(where to be fair even a 3 year old kid could easily kill the strongest guy in the world if the kid had a dagger and the guy wasnt prepared for getting stabbed in the eye) is like complaining that some small detail doesn't make sense in an RPG game, while being completely fine with the fact that characters are literally shooting fireballs out of their hands. She had access to the "kryptonite" of the night king in the form of a dagger, I don't see how her gender, age or weight has any impact on her being able to kill him or not in this case, no matter how "strong" he is supposed to be.
