I'm not saying that theft at Coinbase isn't a concern, only that it is unfair to project the fear of the Mt. Gox crash onto Coinbase because their security is so far superior.

I've always thought that irony was when what is expected to be the solution causes or exacerbates the problem or vice versa. That's pretty much always worked with every use I've heard. Works with your example too. Since I haven't ever really heard a clear definition, I just kind of tried to create my own. Not sure if it's totally correct.

Yeah. I don't understand. How can you compare Bitcoin network expenditures with the above directly? Bitcoin is such a small network/operation in comparison to the others, especially banking which processes hundreds or thousands of more transactions than the Bitcoin network does per minute. If Bitcoin were to scale, wouldn't we expect it to cost more to maintain the network? By mining's inherent, competitive nature, shouldn't mining costs increase exponentially as the network grows?
On an unrelated note, "It costs $503, on average, to mine a Bitcoin". Wow, if that figure is roughly correct, I can see why there is so much worry among miners taking profit. Luckily, we have 21e6, an exclusive mining operation funded by people with deep pockets, who are willing to lose money for the short-term in the chance that Bitcoin will eventually increase in value enough for them to turn a profit.

Thanks for the well-thought-out reply. I know the reasons for limiting private equity to the wealthy are likely more complex than I made them out to be. I feel like creating an exchange for private equity would not involve so much overhead, but I do not know enough about computer science or finance to say this with confidence. 
This issue is becoming increasingly important as the landscape for private equity ownership changes. There are now more VC firms creating more value for their portfolio companies per dollar than ever before, more angel investors than ever (250k was decided in the 80's, when that was a lot more money than it is today), and you have online platforms like Angellist which make it easy to raise a ton of money quickly and gain a lot of exposure without ever going public. Lastly, with the advent of the modern internet over the last ten years and all its analytics, business, and social platforms, which makes it easy for many of these companies to be transparent about their work and their team. What you get is a ton of private companies that can quickly gain all the benefits of going public without ever actually going public. I will admit that the vast majority of private investments go bankrupt within a couple years of being founded, all it takes is one or two smart private investments to more than make up for the 10 failed ones most of the time.

I agree but that is only a counterpoint to my first point.

One thing that may often be overlooked is that I don't necessarily think Bitcoin investments are a bet that the value of Bitcoins will increase.
One, payment processors make money in the form of fees, regardless of whether the exchange rate goes up or down.
Two, Bitcoin is such a radically important technology that buying into a Bitcoin company is a great bet even if you don't believe that Bitcoin will pan out. In other words, if you thought that some technological aspects of the Bitcoin protocol are revolutionary in some industry (not necessarily as currency but possibly just in its security, contract, or data storage applications), it would be worth an enormous investment on those grounds alone. And it would be worth investing in the Bitcoin space just to get close to those who might understand the technology best.
Three, most Bitcoin investments are VC firms, which basically follow the high-risk high reward business model, wherein 80 percent of their investments tank but the other 10/20 percent.realize such phenomenal returns that everyone still makes bank.
Four, a lot of investment is from VC firms in San Francisco. The amount of investment money these firms has is ridiculous and it seems like every day multiple VC firms are making 10-100 mil investments into some app or something. Just look at Andreesen Horowitz, whose investments comprise over 50 percent of Bitcoin investment money globally. They invested 60 mil into Bitcoin companies. That is literally like 2 percent of the money they have available to invest (they manage a fund where they have about 3-4 bil to play around with.
TL;DR I am also excited about all the recent Bitcoin investments and businesses emerging to create a much richer blockchain ecosystem. I'm just saying that you should take the recent investment news with a big ol grain of salt.

If we're talking about star power in terms of amount of influence on people who matter (e.g. other investors, politicians, etc.), then the X-axis would be more accurate inverted.

I think that is a valid concern. However, it is not really fair to worry about Coinbase so much on account of Mt. Gox. I think people underestimate just how terribly unqualified Mt. Gox staff was. Mt. Gox was high school, Coinbase is graduate school. Gox didn't even have internal auditing so I'm surprised Karpeles could successfully locate his dick if he didn't think that was important. Compare that with the system Coinbase uses, which is essentially 97+% offline cold storage, huge regular audit checks (sometimes from competitors), and using a private key system similar to OpenSSL, where they encrypted dozens of USB keys each with a small fraction of each private key, put them in bank vaults scattered throughout the globe, where only certain vaults can be accessed by certain staff, making it a huge event to access offline funds where most team members would need to come together just to access the keys.

It's okay. I still read Dr. Seuss too.
@_date: 2014-06-05 04:44:38
Don't see anything about staff only having a fraction of each private key but that was discussed in an interview.

I know and I agree. I was just saying that throwing $100 at each undergrad student probably isn't going to get them sufficiently interested to affect meaningful change. There are a lot of people out there who think that kids at top schools could cure cancer over the weekend, and judging by the tone of many comments, a lot of people have that kind of idea in their heads. Just saying that there are definitely people out there who put certain schools on a pedestal and, even if the average MIT student truly were a child prodigy, $450,000 probably isn't enough to really get students interested. At a school like MIT, most students are probably pretty well aware of Bitcoin already, so I don't think it's going to be raising much awareness on campus either.

Cool. There are a lot of smart people at MIT, but hold your tits. That doesn't mean they will come up with a bunch of brilliant killer apps. Honestly, high school's not that hard and high SAT performance pretty much only requires fluency in ninth grade math. These people are obviously smart, but let's not get away from ourselves and think that kids who could do basic Calculus in high school have the general skill set to just immediately go and develop revolutionary killer apps for Bitcoin. I think this news is great but it's pretty overrated.

One of my biggest concerns is that some company with a huge bankroll like Apple comes along and decides to unleash their own virtual currency that essentially is a carbon copy of Bitcoin. I recognize that there will always be value in a currency whose value is completely divorced from that of any institution, but that value may be severely diminished once a major institution financially backs  its own ryptocurrency.

Swarm is trying to do something similar. They are a crowdfunding platform where you can buy actual equity in the company/project through coins that each company/project issues. I don't know the details on how Ethereum, NXT, or Swarm differ and I don't know enough about any of them to endorse them. But I will say that Swarm's core idea and manifesto strongly resonate with me and address the major injustice of the SEC laws that limit private equity to the wealthy angel investors. They entirely circumvent SEC rules and regulations through coin issuance, for the first time opening up private equity to the masses. If they are going to achieve their stated goal or be shut down within the year remains to be seen. I only brought up Swarm because I didn't see it mentioned. My impression is that Swarm's focus is more narrow than the others, being singly focused on becoming the go-to crowdsourcing platform.
It really is unjust that only people who make a certain annual salary can legally purchase equity in private companies. Meanwhile, people who are not rich often still fund a good portion of companies but get nothing in return (e.g. Oculus Rift). Adding insult to injury, gambling and the lotto are legal, which are statistically impossible to beat, while the government declares private investments illegal for the majority to "protect the ignorant masses from themselves" or something to that affect.
***Summary of the current state of affairs:***
* 1) Ordinary people back early projects on Kickstarter, Indiegogo, etc.
* 2) Early projects that look promising get additional backing from angel investors but angel investors get something in return- a stake in the company (people who make $250k/yr are angel investors; that is literally the only qualification to own equity in a private company).
* 3) Value of company may increase in value by orders of magnitude. Let's take the case of Oculus Rift. Initial 20 million valuation. Sold to Facebook for 3 billion. Early backer who pledged $100 gets free t-shirt instead of $15,000 return he deserves. Because he did not make 250k this year it is illegal for him to buy equity in private companies. Angel investor makes $15,000 for the same $100 investment because he made enough money the last two years to legally buy shares instead of invest in companies for t-shirts and coffee mugs as insulting consolation prizes like the 98% of "peasants" who participated in funding.
* 4) Meanwhile, government says people who make less than 250k/year can't legally buy private equity. Because having more money = more financially savvy/responsible. Mike Tyson and Justin Bieber should teach all those CPA's and CFA's who aren't hitting 250k a thing or two about smart investing and financial planning, eh? Justin Bieber made so much this year, I am sure his financial modelling algorithms are off the chain /sarcasm. Government says people who make less than 250k/yr are "stupid peasants", regardless of educational attainment and must be limited to buying stagnant public stocks that have already experienced their major growth phase, sketchy pink sheets which require exorbitant subscription fees to properly research, or trying their luck gambling at the casino or the lotto (virtually statistically certain to fail).
***TL; DR.*** In my opinion, this is one of the biggest injustices in our financial system and limiting private equity ownership to the wealthy is probably a big factor in the increasing income distribution gap between the rich and poor. Poor people can't participate in growing markets because they are "too stupid" to make good decisions, but by all means gamble your money away at the casinos, says the government.

Chris Dixon's first Bitcoin blog post is what also originally piqued my interest. He was talking about applications that I see brought up frequently now, but not at the time (when I only ever heard Bitcoin talked about as money). That guy has a great ability to see the forest and not get distracted by the trees. If you mention enough challenging implementation details, even really smart investors will usually lose sight of what made an investment so attractive in the first place (e.g. poor UI, string of thefts, property taxes, etc.). He has a good ability to not get psychologically sucked up into the negative hivemind and stick to his guns.

Thanks for linking answer above.

Thanks for clarifying. I suspected there would be a similar explanation but couldn't find anything myself. Although the investment is much less interesting in this context, the world's leading trading platform investing in its first blockchain-enabled financial company probably sends a pretty positive signal to the market.
It would also be nice to get an idea of NYSE's level of risk aversion. Most of the reputable big investors in Bitcoin so far are venture capital groups. And although they send a positive signal to the market, it is not one that most investors/institutions are too interested in listening too; most firms aren't organized around maintaining such a risky portfolio and don't have the stomach to follow VC money. Getting money from big, conservative institutions will be the next signal to stimulate an influx of money to support Bitcoin startups. In the long-term, I'm not sure how I feel about who's investing in Bitcoin but since what I'm most concerned about right now is just that people become aware of Bitcoin and that there is a healthy amount of money going to startups to do creative things with it, almost any investment is a good investment.

I feel like this is too ridiculous/good to be true; that the NYSE has never found it appropriate to invest in a single company for nearly 200 yrs until they were so blown away by Coinbase that they decided to start now. Can someone confirm this for me? Maybe their profile page is incomplete or inaccurate on CrunchBase. I was unable to confirm this by looking at their site; would be great for a very official source to corroborate the investment.
