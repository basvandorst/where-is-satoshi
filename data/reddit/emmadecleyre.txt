Jim Fulner, Candidate for US Senate in Michigan has been accepting Bitcoin for way longer AND he is defying the Feds ruling and not converting them into fiat as soon as he takes them in.
@_date: 2014-04-18 01:00:44
are they still accepting it, and has it began to roll out across other sites yet? 
@_date: 2014-04-17 15:08:08
Web based wallets, I believe that is their only real option now. Tell them to get out of the walled garden that is apple.

you get 3% off you purchase with BTC on Gyft, that is an advantage 
@_date: 2014-04-17 17:54:49
I don't know if I like this, it seems trusting your private keys to anyone is a bad idea. 
@_date: 2014-04-15 18:13:58
so, i was viewing your site and the girl you have listed as Belle is totally Faye Reagan

Well, anonymity is kind of important. Especially with governments wishing to tax bitcoin. Don't think that coinbase isn't submitting your information to the IRS. They can't tax what they don't know you have.
@_date: 2014-04-19 01:10:44
Because we couldn't have internet without government... yup seems legit
@_date: 2014-04-18 01:39:50
you don't actually use bitcoin as a everyday currency do you?
@_date: 2014-04-17 18:23:39
29% would then be happy to use bitcoin, not bad, not bad at all
@_date: 2014-04-17 15:04:48
Gyfy is awesome, one day I left the house without my wallet and was able to just use them to buy what I needed. I have been using them quite a bit since. I just hope they get a few gas stations partnered up, 3% back on gas would be tits.

Mycelium is a great app, love the addition of the local trader
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:42:21
Any wallet that you control the private keys
@_date: 2014-04-18 01:11:08
So what? Jim Fulner, candidate for US Senate, is accepting bitcoin AND he actually supports bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:19:31
It shows how easy bitcoin transactions are for the user, I love this video.
@_date: 2014-04-18 17:50:56
If you resist the kidnapping they'll kill you

The federal election committee came out a while ago, after US Senate Candidate Jim Fulner began accepting them, saying that if you accept Bitcoin you must convert them into Fiat immediately upon receiving the funds. Jim Fulner's campaign is defying this ruling. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 18:20:14
Which is why it is appropriate to use in order to mock people that hold silly positions like bitcoin isn't money
@_date: 2014-04-18 12:18:54
The government wants a piece of the pie without the effort. Also, should you have to keep all the records that would be necessary for capital gains tax on your currency it effectively makes it inoperable as a currency and encourages using fiat. With currency it is taxed in an entirely different way, and that is when you transfer them back and forth between usd, the IRS claims the right to tax you anytime a purchase is made.
@_date: 2014-04-14 17:44:57
right, i don't think they realize that they are getting bitcoin customers with gyft or something. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 17:59:48
why anyone would pay taxes on bitcoin is beyond me. if some 0s and 1s that some people find valuable are taxable then so are item drops in video games. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 15:33:55
Right, so simple a hippy can do it lol
@_date: 2014-04-18 01:38:58
fuck um
@_date: 2014-04-14 18:31:18
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:41:48
Funny how this happens right after Mycelium Trader comes out...
@_date: 2014-04-17 20:08:58
When you buy bitcoin and the bitcoin has a gain you are subject to capital gains tax according to the IRS, if they don't know you have them they can't tax them.
@_date: 2014-04-18 12:19:47
Exactly, they got the guns and will kill you should you resist the tax.
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:35:11
But when you get your bitcoin on Coinbase you have no shield of anonymity that a local bitcoin exchanger provides. It is allso a trustless transaction as you are face to face with the exchanger and get the bitcoin instantly without having to give all your information as you do with coinbase.
@_date: 2014-04-17 17:43:49
Muh gold
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:40:13
I guess I did
@_date: 2014-04-18 11:59:17
And that is ridiculous to have to do 8 pages of bullshit in order to spend a currency. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 23:57:38
Did yoou claim your Bitcoin on your taxes this year? Did I run into the one person who actually did that?
@_date: 2014-04-15 01:57:57
how would they lose customers by accepting another payment option? that is like saying if you accept master card by also accepting visa you would be losing customers.
@_date: 2014-04-17 15:01:20
I don't see how that ties in
@_date: 2014-04-17 14:59:57
@_date: 2014-04-18 01:38:22
exactly 
@_date: 2014-04-18 01:04:17
they must have stopped, i don't see it
@_date: 2014-06-13 23:21:33
I have never used eGifter before, do they really offer 6%? I always thought it was 3% just like Gyft
