the other subs are getting better (whereas the quality of this sub goes down), it just takes some time and involvement of everyone

I suggest you write about this sub and how it is run by shady mods. Other bitcoin subs are growing in users and getting better in quality posts. More attention would be good for Bitcoin and the community.

it seems people love those who you call trolls and hate arrogance and censorship :-)

the mods here react to freedom of speech like those bank managers react to Bitcoin

The dictator of this sub deletes everything that is against his opinion. When he got downvoted, he deleted the scores. The only reason I'm still here is to see what comes next.

- in the eyes of many, it's mainly used by criminals, druggies, and that weird nerd species  
- discussions mainly controlled (manipulated?) by one person, which is pretty ironic for a decentralized and "free" currency; makes Bitcoin look shady  
- price dropped from once &gt;$1000 to now $230; makes it look like a failure  
- many scams  
- you need to have some computer knowledge, otherwise you can easily lose your coins (accidentally, stolen, virus)  
- few possibilities for everyday usage
