Pretty volatile pension if you ask me - are you willing to risk your retirement money on a currency that might be worthless in ten years. I'm not saying it will but why take the risk.

How powerful is the node's hardware? Is it a low-powered device like a raspberry pi? 
If you can't find any bottlenecks in the hardware you're using (like a slow hard-drive), try tweaking the Bitcoin node's settings by experimenting with some of the ram cache's memory limits.

Seems more like a design flaw with blockchain. Also you have to consider that while the size of the blockchain increase the price of storage hardware decrease - in a sense they cancel each other out (kind of).

Who pays with gold? If you're not going to use a cryptocurrency then at least use a bank transfer which has similar fees to Bitcoin and will probably get confirmed quicker.

Keeping the block size as small as possible does have its advantages. 
It means the blockchain size will scale linearly with time at the same rate forever into the future and you can predict accurately how large the blockchain size will be in ten, or twenty years. This is a good thing, but it is really a balance between txps and stability of the network 20 years into the future. 
I personally think this is a non-issue since running a full node is not a requirement for most clients and the network would still reliable enough with only a couple hundred full nodes with high end hardware nodes capable with large storage capacity and fast bandwidth.

Satoshi also said that the 1mb block size limit was a temporary setup to prevent spam attacks and wanted to increase block size ��

Did you just assume satoshi's gender?
@_date: 2017-01-18 12:37:47
Is this because new blocks have to hash all the previous blocks before them?

it’s not like you needed my permission, my Reddit history is public. And tbh you could probably dox me pretty easily if you went through it all. The only thing is i don’t really care. I understand I’m being cocky but I know the basic principle of how private keys work. Frankly without it, even if you had my address, all my personal info etc, you still would not be able to take my crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:04:57

Haha thanks man. I your description was pretty accurate. I’m a huge fan of coding in my spare time. Hopefully crypto becomes mainstream and what you said becomes true. Tbf I was already fortunate enough to come from a fairly wealthy family and had an older brother who used bitcoin a lot (mainly to buy shit on Silk Road). Guess I was just lucky ����

How would this effect a miner's income at all? There would likely still be other transactions in the mempool they could try mine, or even worse: an unlimited number of empty blocks they could still mine.
@_date: 2017-04-10 22:24:16
If it doesn't get confirmed the money will be returned to your account. In the meantime, you can still move you Bitcoin if you sign another transaction with a higher fee.

Don't think it still works with such high fees, wouldn't make sense to send a $0.10 transaction with a $0.50 fee x2

Because I will get downvoted to oblivion for being of the opinion that ethereum actually scales **better** than bitcoin. 
Firstly, a transaction sent with a gas price of 2 gwei will confirm in three minutes and cost only $0.004, check for yourself - 
Secondly, if you look at the ethereum roadmap eth is planning to implement sharding and POS in the future which will further improve scaling compared to bitcoins non-existent scaling plan.

@_date: 2017-05-23 19:42:06
First you wanna try boot the laptop, if that doesn't work I would recommend carefully removing the hard_drive and using something like [this]( to make a backup. 
Go through the files and look for the wallet.dat file which has the private keys. Hope you become rich!

Sorry can you enlighten me on what the current consensus is? UASF? BU hard-fork? Do nothing because the price is increasing?
