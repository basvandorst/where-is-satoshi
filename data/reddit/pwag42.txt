The fact that you think that *elected* officials are the only significant ones demonstrates *your* "deliberate misunderstanding of the very core concepts of politics". The Federal Reserve, the Supreme Court, the ATF, the FCC, the FBI, the CIA... there are too many *unelected* officials with essentially legislative powers to list. And that is hardly an "amerocentric" problem.


No, the "popular and democratic choice" is that it's not worth *getting killed* over, and that voting for the incumbent is easier than *thinking*. Furthermore, you're still making an appeal to the majority; that it's ok to trample on the rights of individuals and minorities just because it is the "popular and democratic choice of the people in your jurisdiction" to do so.

You can buy things with it, so that's verifiably false (as is your assertion that it never can or will improve).


At least you didn't make the same absolute(ly wrong) statement as before, but it still functions, right now, as a store of value; I can buy some today, and reliably be able to sell it tomorrow.
The idea that gold has "intrinsic value" is just as fallacious; both as a currency and as a store of value, it's just as dependent on public perception as bitcoin is. If you want to make the case that it's "intrinsic value" comes from niche industrial applications, then consider that bitcoin can also be used to write arbitrary data to the blockchain, serving as a decentralized, unfalsifiable public record. That's obviously pretty valuable, if you're technologically literate at all.

Name a "currency" that is "100% useless as a currency", and I'll admit that usability isn't a necessary function of a currency. Until then, though, if it's usable as a currency *then it's a currency*, and vice versa.


No, it's literally not. Because you can spend it, thus *literally* "using" it. You're trying to equate "does a job sub-optimally" with "doesn't do it at all". And regardless, if bitcoin "isn't usable", then neither is the dollar, for the reasons I already mentioned.


Yeah. Because a store of value *literally only has to store some value*. I first started buying in at 4k, it's done a *tremendous* job of storing value, if not always on a day-to-day basis. "Wildly" fluctuating is only a matter of scale, the dollar's lost far more over its lifespan; in fact, it's had an overall downward trend. Again, being momentarily bad at a job is not the same as not doing it at all. All bitcoin has to do to achieve its purpose is retain *any value at all* as fiat currencies around the world crash and it will still have served as a store of value.


Your logic is circular. Jewelry's *appraised price* is derived from the prices of the materials from which it's made. In other words, your argument is "gold has intrinsic value because jewelry has intrinsic value because it's expensive because gold is expensive". Appraised price =/= intrinsic value.


CS is what I got my Bachelor's in, but hey, as long as we're playing the "making things up to discredit claims" game, here's one: you're illiterate, because you keep ignoring claims and moving goalposts.


*Brute forcing* a decryption is impossible. However, no mathematical proof exists for it being unsolvable via other means; but thanks for revealing how new *you* are to cryptography. And *you're* the one that presupposed a potential flaw in bitcoin's protocol (a sha256-based blockchain) in the first place.


*Name it.* We already established that jewelry doesn't have intrinsic value, and gold as a store of value *predates* it's industrial applications (so unless you want to claim that it recently *gained* its "intrinsic" value...)


Well, considering that the use-case I described is literally the entire rationale for a blockchain (as a transaction ledger primarily, but technically for any arbitrary data), *you're* the one making false claims, and have no leg to stand on.

You mean all the blame of a system that allows the government to print money and extend credit willy-nilly at the expense of the working class? A system *entirely at odds* with capitalism, as demonstrated by its need to use violence to separate people from the products of their labor?


Your English is too broken to even derive a point from here.


Yeah, *if you work for the government*, you communist. The fact that you'd equate the government stealing everyone's gold and forcing them to use unbacked pieces of paper with "capitalism" (when it's an example of central planning if there ever was one) only demonstrates how much you're willing to disregard reality (economic and otherwise) in your blind worship of the state.

So just because transactions don't make sense at certain scales, it isn't a currency? Great! That means the dollar isn't a currency either, because some transactions don't have a high enough profit margin to cover the cost of a credit card transaction. And you know, fee-less transactions are pretty easy, too: just print off a paper wallet and hand it to somebody. Boom! Free transfer.


Yeah, so it retained 90% of its value. It doesn't have to keep *all* of it, gold doesn't do that either. That BTC is *more* volatile than gold is irrelevant, if *ever* losing *any* value means it isn't a store, then gold isn't one either.


Ah, so nothing can ever become a store of value, because it must first go through a speculatory period. Weird, and here I thought that at some point in history someone would have had to *decide* to use gold as currency, not that the universe was formed with gold coins already in peoples' pockets...
(And I love the new qualifier "reliable", I think you're already realizing that "BTC *isn't* a store of value" is literally untrue.)


You're clearly confused about the meaning of "intrinsic". Jewelry's value is entirely subjective; useless except as conspicuous consumption. Likewise, the uses for gold in electronics are a recent invention, with gold's use as a currency (and thus store of value) predating it by *millennia*, and it's not used enough there to significantly impact the price, which as you admitted, is largely a result of speculation. Many of the downfalls you attribute to bitcoin could just as easily be applied to gold or even dollars, too: governments could (as they have in the past) ban/seize it, platinum has *already* overtaken it in terms of price, a flaw in SHA256 would compromise nearly all encrypted internet traffic (such as credit card transactions); and a 51% attack is *mind bogglingly* difficult, and would not go undetected (considering the sheer amount of power and hardware it would take, not to mention how counterproductive it would be). Again, if you complain that bitcoin's *small but undeniable* intrinsic value doesn't count, then neither does gold's. They're both overvalued relative to their "intrinsic" value, that doesn't stop them from being stores of value.

And in what way was it not? Or more correctly: how can a thing be "owned" by "everyone" at all? A thing cannot be owned by 2 people: if you cannot do with it as you like (because others do not), how can you be said to own it? If someone else can do with it as they like (without your consent), how can you be said to own it?
The fact is that no non-trivial economy can be entirely understood by everyone; therefore, certain parts must function regardless of the consent of those not immediately involved, and if it functions regardless of someone's consent, they cannot be said to "own" it. That's why socialism is fated to centralization: an administrative class will always exist, and the most abusive sort is the kind that can't be supplanted by the market (i.e. the people).

*And* you're already "no true scotsman"-ing. Per [the dictionary]( anarchy is:
* absence of government
* a state of lawlessness or political disorder due to the absence of governmental authority the city's descent into anarchy
* a utopian society of individuals who enjoy complete freedom without government
You admit that "words mean things", however, *you* are the one twisting definitions around to suit your own purposes. I can't help but notice that your "means of production" doesn't factor into it *at all*, let alone that they must be "shared", so excuse me if I quit responding to any of your redefinitionist attempts here.


If *you* knew anything about *capitalism* you'd know that the term's first usage in English is a recent one: the Oxford English Dictionary places it in 1854. You cannot be "explicitly" against a thing "for literally hundreds of years" without even naming it; the closest you could get is to be explicitly against *something else*, and then conflate the two (the communist's gold medal event).


In another example of "twisting words around", you clearly have no idea what "involuntary" means. Let me put it to you this way: you could go out in the woods somewhere, right now, and live off the land, and nobody would stop you. You could do it with a bunch of your socialist pals and start a commune. You *don't*, because that would be harder than selling your labor. Thus, you *cannot* claim that you, or anyone else in a "capitalist" country, "involuntarily" sells your labor. There are myriad ways that you could provide for yourself; that selling your labor is the *best* option is a glowing *recommendation* of capitalism, not a condemnation of it.


Have you ever had a job? Or do you just imagine that everyone who owns a business swims around in a pile of money all day, without a single thought to how the business is run? If you know of a field where capital just magically accumulates without constant shepherding, *tell me what it is*. Not to mention, of course, that it's all a matter of scale. You clearly have a computer, that's capital. Are you saying you don't work? Then why do you speak for those of us who *do*?


Because "common ownership" *is a myth*. Two people cannot own a thing; either you have the ability to do with it as you wish, or you *don't*. Lets imagine that we have a boot-making machine, our "means of production". We'll set aside the issue of where it came from (hint: it was somebody's labor). Now, I suddenly decide I don't want boots anymore, I want sandals. So, I start modifying the machine to produce sandals instead. "But wait," you say, "I still want boots"! How do you resolve this? Only one of us can have our way, and if you cannot have your way with a thing, how can you claim to own it? There must be an authority that determines who can do what with what, and *they*, whether it be you, me, or someone else, is the one that *actually* owns the thing, and thus there is a hierarchy: some are able to dictate who can do what with what.


I'm saying that *because* the necessity of labor is a physical reality, and capitalism is merely a tool to allow the laborer the most efficient means of deriving value from it, that any derision of capitalism under the claim that capitalist labor is "involuntary" applies in *greater* measure to socialism, which is always less efficient *for the laborer* than free exchange is. Nothing about capitalism precludes voluntary cooperation, it is only your *socialism* that mandates that the means of production must be wrested from the hands of those that created them in the first place.

In other words: any coercion-less society would be functionally indistinguishable from anarcho-*capitalism*, and because socialism is largely defined by its incompatibility with capitalism (specifically, individual property rights), anarcho-socialism is a contradiction in terms.

But "quantity of wealth" and "quantity of bitcoins" aren't the only relevant variables to tracking inflation/deflation.

As a trivial example, imagine a 2-person economy, in which there is a total of 8 dollars. If they are buying each-other's labor, the currency is inflated if they are doing it at a rate of 2 dollars per day compared to 1 dollar per day, even though the money supply and production are the same.

No, if it were "backed" by their labor, you could demand an exchange of one for the other from the currency issuer; but per the 14th amendment that's illegal. The dollar was once backed by gold, and then the government stole and sold all the gold; that doesn't magically make it "backed" by anything.

Again, I have the *choice* of whether or not to work for dollars. In fact, the rate at which I work for dollars changes *very* frequently. Thus, the dollar is in no way "backed" by my labor.

I've got a B.S., I know what I'm talking about. Furthermore, if you're comparing the quality of education received at a university to that received at high school, you're only underlining my point: high schools purposefully provide woefully inadequate educations so that they can better serve as a pipeline to colleges: that's why there are so many remedial courses offered at university. There's a reason that there are no jobs you can get with only a high-school diploma outside of the government; it's barely even proof that you're literate, let alone educated.

Is that why colleges like to recite the numbers about how "higher degrees equal higher salaries" at recruitment fairs? Is that why student loans, especially for degrees focused towards high-paying jobs, are so expensive?

No, central banks do it because that's how they make money (heh). Central banks causing inflation is the real cause of most economic bubbles: when people are able to make investments without shouldering the risk (because the money invested was taken from the producers by inflation) they over-allocate resources to a segment of the market, leading to an inevitable correction (aka "crash").
A currency going deflationary *permanently* is impossible, because people will still need to buy goods and services, and thus will still spend; if no-one's spending, no-one's working, and if no-one's working, prices rise, cancelling out the deflation. The long-term goal of bitcoin (or any other quantity-limited crypto) isn't truly a deflationary currency, but a *stable* one: one that stays level with worldwide production.

Hey, you were the one who first said "I can't even respond to this" to perfectly reasonable statements.
But I think I've diagnosed you: your ego is so wrapped up in the notion that higher education makes you superior that the existence of people who don't esteem it as highly is an affront to you. That someone might possess a point of view you hadn't considered is a personal insult: after all, you can't stop talking about how much better your ability to discern "nuance" is than those filthy, uneducated plebians. That your own arguments are fallacious is irrelevant, after all, you're educated; even if what you said is wrong, *you*'re still right.
How dare dissenters not pursue education for as intellectual of reasons! How dare an engineer pursue the study of physics, not to critique literature, but to learn to create labor-saving devices! How dare an entrepreneur study business, not to "fight the status quo", but to provide for himself and his family! How dare a doctor pursue the study of medicine, not to consider Marx, but to heal the sick! *How dare they pursue education not for its own sake, but as a tool to better the world?

Neither is the dollar: what's the problem with trading an unbacked currency for another one? Heck, you admit the dollar's worth less than a third of what it was 30 years ago, you'd think you could look at that and realize what a godsend a deflationary currency is.

That's the funniest thing I've heard all day! If you understood basic supply and demand, you'd realize that because demand is artificially inflated to the extent that it is, but supply isn't growing at the same rate, they can charge whatever they want and still get "customers". They're all packed to the brim by a high school system engineered to push as many students in as possible, there's no need to compete.


And how, exactly, does the government "ensure" that someone will always accept it? Can I call up the police and have them point a gun at the head of a store owner because they don't want to take my money? It must take *astounding* historical and economic illiteracy to believe that a currency has any value just because it's issued by a government. Heck, it takes regular old illiteracy to believe that a currency exchangeable for nothing by the issuing body is "backed" at all. If it's "backed" by the government, then what's the exchange rate? How much "faith and trust" can I redeem 1 dollar for? The fact that you think a ledger has no value just demonstrates the depth of your ignorance: companies and your vaunted government both pay *fortunes* to keep track of their money.


No, the value of *all U.S. dollars put together* has increased 3x. If you put money in a savings account in 1980, and then withdrew from it today and tried to buy something, you'd only be able to afford 1/3 of what you could back then. I shouldn't have to explain such basic arithmetic to you. The fact that you think bitcoin's limited supply is a *bad* thing for its value only demonstrates just how backwards your knowledge of literally everything you've mentioned is.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:28:19
Sure, but that's essentially where the perceived value of government-printed fiat comes from too: the speculation that it will retain its value. Frankly, I suspect that bitcoin will be over-valued (and thus experience a correction) before it levels out, but I also think that it's going to be quite a while before that happens, and that it won't happen until *after* it has become an accepted medium of exchange, simply because until it does, it still has the potential to reach a wider audience.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:47:04
But if it never becomes spendable, then it can't keep rising. And again, the problems of hyperinflation aren't relevant to deflation. The "instability" of Zimbabwe's currency was only a problem because it was *losing* value.

b. that you're narrow-minded enough to believe that that was what I was referring to without any verification (I was actually referring to identity politics that prevent people from seeing eachother as individuals, but as demographics, but you still prove my point)






And thus you truly tip your hand: your arguments can't stand on their own, so the best you can do is slander me, lying about the state of *my* education while expecting me to take you at your word regarding *yours*. If *you* "knew how to think", you'd realize that putting words in someone's mouth, *ad hominem* attacks, unbacked assertions, and *outright lies* do not an argument make. That you imagine what you're doing is "seeing nuance" is laughable. That you think that "everyone who's been to college will agree with me, and since you don't, you haven't" only proves how ignorant your idea that "college isn't indoctrination" really is: if you really understood diversity of viewpoints, you'd realize that two people can experience the same thing and have different opinions about it.

If you care that much, then save it for after they respond.

I've already noted in the other thread (another point against double-responding to a comment) that your worldview is too based in false equivocation for any logical conversation, but this dead horse is worth beating. "Most humans" is not *everyone*.

@_date: 2018-02-06 02:09:22
But we do have an example of a stronger economy with lower employment: compare the US economy today to the one 200 years ago. Employment is much lower, and yet the standard of living today is much higher. You can say "that's because of technological advancements, not deflation", but those advancements were in no small part produced by deflation enabling capital accumulation by the masses. Employment and production aren't directly correlated. An economy in which 1 person can use a tractor to produce 20 tons of food is better off than one where 10 people can produce 10 tons by hand, even if the latter has 100% employment and the first does not.
Inflation is not the result of economic growth. Just think about it for a second: how do you expect prices to go *up* when valuable production (and thus supply) *also* goes up? That's a violation of the most basic law of economics right there: higher supply = lower prices, lower supply = higher prices.
Deflation doesn't hurt the economy. Deflation trims the fat of the economy, and because there is a *massive* industry built up around producing that fat (I'm mentioned central banks and government "stimulus" already) the lie that deflation is bad is perpetuated.

I'll tell you what. If you can find me a *single* legal precedent of the U.S. government forcing someone to accept payment in USD instead of another currency, I'll admit that the dollar has some force behind it.
However, I've allowed you to stray from the real point. "Backed currency" is short for "commodity-backed currency". USD is backed by no commodity. Thus, it is no different from bitcoin with regard to *literal* backing.
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:22:17
But reaching full adoption necessitates a rise in price, because the market cap of bitcoin needs to reach parity with the world's production in order for it to be used for all (or at least most) transactions. Also, stock values aren't tied as closely to company sizes (or more accurately, profits) as you might think; the *dividends* are, but most stock trades are simply speculation, because speculation is what drives it's volatile nature.
Also, deflation isn't a bad thing. That's a lie perpetuated by the people in the business of causing *inflation* (i.e. the federal reserve).

A currency that will never be spent is a currency that has *no* value, let alone an increasing one, saying "X is bad because of impossible scenario Y" is fallacious.

Juilliard v. Greenman isn't applicable, because dollars *were backed by gold*, and thus the court could assert that X dollars was worth Y silver coins.
You admit that it's merely a "figurative" backing; even if the government can force you to accept payment in dollars, because dollars are backed by no commodity there is no official exchange rate of dollars to *anything* to use for valuation, and you could simply demand a price in dollars too high to be paid; there is no law against "discounts" for certain payment methods, after all.
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:41:23


This is entirely false. What gives it value is peoples' *perception* that it has value. Nothing more, nothing less. They're called "fiat" currencies for a reason; they are *literally* unbacked. The US's economic output correlates to the dollar's strength only inasmuch as America's producers are willing to trade what they produce for dollars, and they contribute no more than *foreign* producers who are likewise willing to trade for dollars. Military might, meanwhile, has *no* bearing on the dollar's strength whatsoever; if you think it does, then tell me what the exchange rate is: how much "military might" can I redeem $1 for?


That's only half-true. A small group of buyers could buy up the whole liquid supply of bitcoins, sure. But a "price" requires a buyer *and* a seller; in order to increase the price for members not of their cabal, they have to buy more *from non-members*; likewise, to drive down the price, they have to sell *to non-members*. "Pump &amp; dump" schemes don't work in a vaccum, they depend on panicky suckers who can be tricked into selling low and/or buying high.
And regardless, that's distracting from the *original* point, which was arguing against bitcoin based on it's merits as a *currency*, which by definition implies widespread (if not 100%) adoption. In other words, with statements like:


you're arguing against bitcoin's viability as a currency by implying that its behavior *now* is indicative of it's behavior *in a high adoption scenario* without accounting for the fact that high adoption itself alters the behavior. How many people "enter" the USD market in a week? Probably more than hundreds of thousands, but you don't notice, because there are already so many people using it. *As adoption increases, so does stability*. (Also, people "entering the market" can only drive the value up, not down. More demand == higher prices, that's econ 101.) I'm not arguing that it's a very good currency *now*; I'm arguing that it has great *potential*, and that any argument against it's use as a currency must take into account *all* aspects of it being a currency, not just some of them.

The best way to avoid being taken advantage of is to not base your buying decisions on current price, because that mentality is what pump &amp; dumps prey on.
If you think bitcoin will be viable as a currency, we're nowhere near the top, and if you think it won't, you can't get out fast enough.

@_date: 2018-02-09 17:48:23
But that's the thing: deflation *can't* remain a factor for extended periods. If prices fall fast enough and for long enough that people stop spending, then companies start going out of business, production decreases, *supply* decreases, and prices come back up, thus stopping the deflation.
And debt is a bad thing by default; motivating people to get and stay out of it (unlike our current inflationary system, which is hell-bent on keeping as many people in debt as possible) is a good thing.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:28:18
There's a difference between "encourages spending" and "makes everyone try to dump it as fast as possible". Nor is spending a fundamentally good thing; a currency that is dropping in value causes people to invest in things that are *also* dropping in value, as long as they aren't dropping as fast. In essence, it robs people of the ability to plan for the future, and that's shown by the boom-bust cycle resulting from current monetary policy.

Lower spending doesn't imply lower employment, nor does higher spending imply higher employment. In fact, a monetary policy that motivates "use it or lose it" spending serves only to prevent the capital accumulation that allows for more efficient investment and higher societal productivity.
The inflation that bitcoin is (partly) intended to solve is the direct result of a monetary policy specifically designed to encourage *inefficient* investment. Any time the money supply is increased, that new credit is extended by the central banks to maintain its lending monopoly. Because the organization lending the money didn't need to do anything to gather it in the first place, they can make loans without worrying about them being paid back; as a result, they fund riskier business ventures, which needlessly eat up society's resources, resulting in things like the 2007 mortgage crisis.

They can hire just as many people if they pay them less. And lower spending doesn't necessitate fewer goods and services changing hands, either; they can move just as quickly as long as the price drops.
Likewise, investment is not the same as positive economic activity. There are plenty of bad investments out there; business ventures fail all the time. If you invest in a company, and that company uses the money to hire an employee, and that employee makes a product that doesn't sell, then at the end of the day you've paid money to ensure that employee does not produce anything worthwhile for the duration of his employment. The business venture was a *drain* on society, and because you were the one that enabled it, you lose your investment.
Holding bitcoin, like holding any money, isn't about generating value via economic *stimulation*. *Abstaining* from investment can itself provide value, when spending has become a drain on society. Quality and efficiency of goods and services don't increase when producers are guaranteed an influx of customers who are just trying to get rid of money as quickly as they spend it.

That's some incredible goalpost moving; jumping from "currency rising in value is bad" to "bitcoin can't be a currency because it doesn't have a military" demonstrates that the depth of your economic illiteracy is matched only by your intellectual dishonesty.
Yeah, I disagree with "every government and currency in the entire world", because I'm not so ignorant as to believe that they exist for the benefit of anyone except those that administer them, and if you imagine that the U.S. military is what causes the basic economic laws of supply and demand to dictate that the dollar has value, I'm afraid that I don't even know where to *start* correcting your misconceptions.
And hoarding the currency is irrelevant, because
* again, it can't keep deflating once adoption reaches 100%, people who hoard expecting further increase will *quit* hoarding when it *stops* increasing, and because people *have* to spend to meet their basic needs, there will *always* be a liquid supply

That's the thing though: if bitcoin is universally adopted, the only "return" it will be making is the deflation caused by economic growth; it can't hurt the economy by gaining value too quickly, because if it hurt the economy it would lose value, and thus cancel out it's "gains".
And I've said it before, and I'll say it again: you *can* have less spending and a stronger economy, because not all spending is productive. Some companies *should* go out of business. Some employees *should* be fired. In fact, the first ones to go in times of reduced spending are usually the ones we needed the least.

It's true, we do have different economic views. That's why you believe there is a paradox, and I don't. At least one of us must be mistaken, and I believe that earnest debate must be undertaken with both parties being interested in uncovering flaws in *both* of their thinking, so I must thank you for this exercise. I've certainly had to approach things from new angles.
The problem with the assertion that "deflation is terrible" is that it assumes that the economy, right now, is perfect. That *all* current employment and *all* current spending is productive. They aren't. The very fact that we are being coerced into inflation means that there are business enterprises that exist despite the fact that the economy, if spending could never exceed production, could not support them. Deflation can only be destructive if the market is coerced into it, that is, if *valid* enterprises are forced out of business because they aren't profitable *enough*. It's telling that the very first result on Google when you search for "costs of deflation" is the federal reserve; it's natural that the very same organization that makes its living producing inflation will tell you that deflation is a bad thing. I forgot who first said it, so I'll paraphrase: "when you find that you have the ability to legally print money, you'll suddenly find yourself surrounded by friends, especially economists who produce increasingly complex theories to explain to the masses why you printing money is a good thing."
Economic activity boosts demand, but that's not the same as causing inflation, because economic activity *also boosts supply*. Simply creating more of a thing does not make it more desirable, it just means that the bidding war is more in favor of the buyer. Economic activity pushing the supply curve right pushes the quantity up [*but the price down*]( and I suspect that this misconception is what leads you to believe that you can have "runaway" deflation in an economy with a fixed quantity of currency. If the currency supply is fixed, then the currency can only deflate if production (and thus the economy, but not necessarily spending or employment) improves, and by extension cannot self-destruct, nor damage the economy in anything but the short-term.

That's Keynesian nonsense. Consumption isn't inherently good, and trying to trick people into consuming faster than they otherwise would via artificial inflation is what lead to the great depression, the 2008 mortgage crisis, and basically every example of the boom-bust cycle since the creation of the Federal Reserve. Inflation doesn't increase production; in fact, the opposite is true: when the value of currency drops, margins decrease, causing formerly profitable businesses to operate at a loss (and thus usually go out of business), and causes people to stop investing in business (because returns sufficient to overcome inflation are unavailable at the scale the poor and middle-class can invest at) and focus on personal comforts instead.
Furthermore, because the Federal Reserve increases the money supply by extending credit, *insolvent* (and thus unproductive) business ventures receive disproportionate investment. A private lender that lends to failing businesses would eventually go broke (and out of business) itself, but the Federal Reserve operates under no such restrictions: it can (and does) lend to even failing ventures, because the government will pick up the tab if its debtors can't pay up.
The "race to the bottom" rhetoric is based in a glaring logical/economic contradiction: a currency (or more correctly, the sum of all currencies) *cannot* increase in value as the economy's production drops. As production decreases, so does supply, and as supply decreases, prices rise, thus cancelling out any increase in the currency's buying power (in other words, it's value). Bitcoin is only growing because it's taking value away from other currencies; eventually (with 100% adoption) it will reach parity with the world's production, and thus can only increase in value if the world's production increases.

I bought .25 a month ago, when it tanked for a bit I got scared but now I've made it back and more besides!

So you admit that despite all evidence to the contrary, you're too full of yourself (and trust in nanny government) to admit that you might be wrong? Brilliant.

There is literally no such thing as "freezing" a price. If there's not someone willing to buy and sell for a given price, then the price does not exist.

That's not protection. Literally. The government is protecting you from *nothing* when it threatens taxes out of you. If I come up to you with a bat and threaten to break your shins unless you give me $20, and you pay me off, I haven't "protected" you, no matter how badly you try to abuse the logic of the situation.

Yeah, neither is the dollar. What's your point? I'd rather use an unbacked currency of limited supply than one that could be printed into oblivion any day.

That's why I specified "3.7 Million in today's dollars", 2017 dollars aren't worth the same as 2018 or 2016 dollars.

Except that's impossible, because a currency can't deflate to a value greater than its share of the economy, because there would be nothing to buy with the excess bitcoin. People *need* to buy things (food, shelter, etc.), and if it's made sense to convert all their liquid assets to bitcoin, *they'll buy those things using bitcoin*, because that's what they have. Money is never worth more than what it can buy; if the value of money is great enough that spending slows, then production will slow, supply will decrease, prices will increase, and the currency's value will equalize again.
This is nothing more than an example of looking at half of an equation and then saying "this doesn't make any sense".

We didn't move off of the gold standard because there wasn't enough gold, or because of the country's economic growth. We moved off of it because the government wanted the ability to print more money, because that's a less unpopular way to fund its projects than increased taxation is. And the price of gold is still *vastly* higher than the value of it's industrial applications impart; that's why even after going off the gold standard it was still worth a fortune, despite most of those industrial applications not being invented yet, and why is was used as a store of value for all of recorded human history: gold, like anything, has value because (and only because) people are willing to trade for it.

[citation needed]


Come back when you've actually learned anything about real economics, such as that there are *multiple schools of thought within it*.


You admitted that inflation is a tax on savings, therefore printing money to pay for government debt *is* about how the government spends money.


Literally never mentioned the budget, but thanks for demonstrating that your arguments have no bearing on reality.


You first, kiddo.

money requires institutional backup, which is best provided by a central bank.
Wow, central banks asserting that we "need" them, despite all evidence to the contrary. What a surprise.

I think you're the one failing to understand: I neither misunderstood nor ignored it, I said you were *wrong*. The Federal reserve is the driving force behind inflation.


Being the "best" fiat currency isn't saying much when they're *all* terrible.


Spoken like someone who doesn't understand their own copypasta arguments: your own source was only referring to *unadjusted* GDP, after all. 
Why are you so set on insisting that the Fed printing more money isn't contributing to inflation?
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:05:13
You mean one of the *worst* forms of investment, because it returns interest at a rate lower than inflation. You're literally throwing money away when you lend to the government.

The debt is how much we owe; the deficit is how much *more* we'll owe this year. It's the difference between position and velocity.

Where do you get the idea that gold "failed" as a store of value?
I'd also mention that a currency *can't* "rise exponentially in value" and that as such any argument against bitcoin based in that assumption is inherently fallacious, but I'd just be repeating what I've already said further down the thread.
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:31:21
You're not seeing the contradiction in what you're saying. You say that people buying bitcoin "for other purposes" is what causes it to crash. That is true. *However*, you fail to see that buying stocks in .com companies was the exact same thing: people weren't buying stocks because they believed the particular business ventures were exceptional, they bought stocks because they anticipated selling those same stocks later for a greater profit.
And the internet's purpose *is* tied to .com companies. E-commerce, pay-per-click advertising, etc. are all the backbone of the internet as we now know it. They didn't die out when the .com bubble burst, they just reduced their supply to match the *actual*, instead of *perceived* demand.

The GDP rising would have made the dollar worth *more* if it hadn't been for the Fed.
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:09:19
Not so much "more likely" as "at least as likely": it's possible that if bitcoin isn't well enough established then it could die with the dollar, but in that event there was ho harm "hodling" on, because one worthless currency is just as good as another worthless currency.
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:03:47
...how is this related to *anything* we were talking about? You're just infodumping in lieu of addressing the actual issue, which is that ever since we went off the gold standard, the Fed has been printing money faster than national production has been growing, and so the value of the dollar has plummeted, and shows no signs of stopping.
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:23:35


You mean like how the U.S. dollar has lost 96% of its value since going off the gold standard? I'll take my chances with a non-government currency, thanks.

You keep asserting, completely without proof, that it's been "disproven". If anything, the housing bubble proved that it *wasn't*; even the wikipedia page lists its defenses.


Spoken like someone ignorant of the very real and *contemporary* disagreements between the Freshwaters, Saltwaters, Keynesians, Austrians, etc, and ignoring the question of "if economics is such a "settled" science, why do we still have economic crises?


I'll take "what are treasury bonds" for 500, Alex.


Sorry, I'll admit I got you confused with another poster who was saying that inflation was a good thing because it was a tax on "unproductive investments". However, it still is a tax: a tax on savings, which is collected and spent by banks underwritten by the federal reserve to issue loans at rates that would not be profitable were the credit not essentially produced out of thin air.


That's literally all you need to know! Prices are how society determines efficient allocation of resources. If the price of pencils rises, for example, it doesn't matter whether it's because pencil factory workers went on strike, or the graphite mine dried up, or the forest burned down: all I need to know is that it might be a better idea to switch to a more efficient writing implement. Therefore, any coercion (be it a literal tax or a virtual one)


Wrong, it applies to *any* use of force to allocate resources contrary to their original destination.
