Just took a look on my desktop, yeah 10 k looks like a possible point of resistance, short term for BTC. More solid resistance could be at 5750 area. But that would be wishful thinking with a bubble like this. Ill be optimistic and say post bubble, price of 2000 ish
For clarification, price points I mentioned were sourced from charts.bitcoin.com and I'm not wasting too much time looking at it because I don't have any positions in any sort of crypto. Bubbles are bad mkay?

If that's what makes you feel better about yourself. Blocked.

K. 
I'm not the one confusing trading strategy with advice targeted at 'investors'

Then why did you comment? That's pretty childish. Akin to "lalalalala cant hear you"
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:15:58
I was mistaken. After breaking the 12500 level, it wound up finding support again, before entering a consolidating triangle around 14 and after a longer pause than i thought was going to happen it just popped a bit to 15 and hit some resistance. there was some higher volume in the pop as well, which looks bullish. kind of looks like it'll rally back up again to $20+.

Anyone can make typos. And not everyone does well at grammar. Being weak at grammar doesn't make you weak at evaluating technical patterns, nor does your ability to outline an argument properly with perfect use of the English language on an online forum have any relevance in technical chart pattern recognition, let alone any other descussion other then grammar usage discussions.
**But nice red herring.**
Furthermore, if you base the validity of an argument on grammatical errors that don't make any impact to the actual substance of the argument, instead of the actual argument itself, you are being illogical. Take some time to understand how to actually logically evaluate a claim as well as getting yourself familiar with pattern recognition in technical trading. Come back to me when you can counter my claim with something that actually has weight to it instead of a pointless retort on word usage.
Just for reference, in the hours since my first post, bitcoin peaked at  about $15,000 on December 23rd before beginning to slide back down. On 24th Dec (today) its at just under $13,000 with a general downward trend. If you can recall, I clearly stated the right shoulder should peak at about $15,000 to $16,000 before another downward slide occurs. I even suggested that people sell between those price points if they are in bitcoin to protect themselves from the next downward slide. A sale at this point would have successfully protected against a 14-15 % capital loss. And thus, was a successful prediction.
Full confirmation of the pattern will occur when the slide reaches the neckline of the pattern again. Given that its a descending neckline, I would say that this point lies between 12,000 to 11,000. Possibly even as low as 10,000 given the steepness of the neckline, but that's a bit of a stretch.
 I'm going to put my guess on 12,500. If I had a long position on bitcoin at this current point in time, I would sell should the price go below 12,500 to protect capital. Obviously a successful prediction would mean this proposed sale at that proposed point would shield the seller from sizable capital loss.
But I probably used a word wrong somewhere or accidently used a homophone incorrectly so apparently my argument and analysis is completely invalid, even if its already being shown to be correct. *eyeroll*

11.5 k already??? On a slow ass phone, so can't take a look really myself so ill take your word for it. If true then Jesus Christ, that neckline is a damn guillotine. Unless its already in the drop, and this isn't a head and shoulders. Guesswork sucks but all indications say bad from where I sit.
If I had, I'd sell like crazy right now, screw that. I would not risk the possibility its not a head and shoulders. 12 k would have been my line in the sand.

Eh, ill give you that. Couldn't really come up with a good tl;dr other then the market is looking like its doing pretty close to what I said it would. As well as how basing the validity of a claim based on grammar usage isn't a reliable indicator of the validity of the claim nor does it generally have an impact on the claim. It is a red herring argument if it has nothing to do with the premise.

Not a cryptofan, but there's this.
Stock markets and other investment vehicles are not ponzi schemes, but can be used in ponzi schemes. Likewise, crypto and blockchain speculation in of itself is not a ponzi scheme, but they can be the method in which a group can carry out a ponzi scheme.

As opposed to the morons going *yeah sure crypto is a safe long term investment.* all swing trading is is holding a position around 2-6 days, maybe a few weeks, to capture short term speculative swings.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:37:46
I still look, just more of a focus on technical then fundamentals with my swing trade money. I dont confuse swing trading positions with my regular investments. Unlike some people. Diversity is important!
I set myself pretty simple rules to follow, portfolio wide. 401k and Roth set up with moderate risk tolerance 5% and 3% contributions respectivly. Short term investment that's got a pretty decent focus on bonds and dividend stocks, and some allocation to things I see long term growth in, robotics, aerospace, and green energy.
And then around 10% of my earmarked investment budget is for swing trading. Usually break even with a couple trades every now and then that net me high return. TOPS and LODE treated me well.

So, I am a swing trader with a few years of experience under my belt. I by no means do it as a fulltime job, and I by no means like crypto, but should you have any holdings in cryptocurrencies, the following information is extremely important.
The past few weeks showed the setup of a possible head and shoulders pattern. It seems crypto is in the right trough. What happens next really depends on how it behaves over the next couple days.
An educated guess is its running through a head and shoulders pattern since we already have established the following set points.
- left shoulder around December 7th 16,500 realm
- left dip, 13500 realm around December 10th
- head, 19500 realm around December 17th.
And it looks like we are establishing a neckline at around 12,000 right now. Which suggests a falling neckline. This is Bad. If you say this is good you are an idiot. If it is a head and shoulders pattern this is in, it will rebound to the 16000 realm to complete the right shoulder before it falls off a cliff to god knows where.
This bubble looks all set to pop, possibly in the next week or so. If I had any holdings, I would be watching the price very closely for signs that confirm this pattern.
Recommended course of action if you hold crypto for some stupidly retarded reason: watch it over the next day or so, see if it sinks past 12000. If it does, *sell immediately to protect capital*. If it starts to rebound, target your sell point at around 15,000 to 16,000 as that should be where the right shoulder will peak. If you miss that you are fucked because bitcoin will fall off a cliff and the entire crypto market will crash. Optimistic guess that lower bounds of crash would be to low thousands high hundreds, since wall street is starting to poke around with it. But it could crash to 0 and die in a fire.
So, all of that is Assuming of course you could pull you money out quick enough, like any other security that exists ever. But crypto, being a retarded combination of volatile and not very liquid at all, probably won't let you get out with any sense of urgency, which could mean you miss the boat and lose biggly. So, with that fundamental taken into account.
 **Sell, sell it all and run for your life. Don't look back, leave. Get the fuck out. She's going down captain! You will not go to space today.**
Hopefully that's memey enough for the densest of crypto heads to understand. 
If your lucky enough to pull out in time, and still wish to invest, I encourage you to look into investing into green industries, robotics, and municipal bonds. The skills you all are learning still translate to other securities, and you stand to make money, as long as you don't make the same mistake of getting cocky and putting all of your eggs into a rocket powered basket without thinking about buying a parachute. And last bits of parting advice: when trading, the worst thing you can think is that 'this time its different' it never is. Don't let emotion make the decisions for you, base your decisions on the fundamentals and the technicals and not *hype trains*
Good luck, and I hope you get out in time.
