Decentralization is desirable, but security is a function of the absolute level of hash power (actually of the absolute cost of the hashing). If Bitcoin was more secure in the GPU era, it's because the lower price didn't make attacks worth it, but any attack has a price and it's currently bigger than ever. (Of course, a single phone call from a Chinese government official is cheap, but still has a political cost).

Quantum computing would give a quadratic increase in hashing speed (i.e. reversing a 256-bit hash would become like reversing a 128-bit one). This is by using Grover's algorithm.

Resist the temptation to trade swings unless you really know what you're doing. Don't be depressed on local price drops; the eventual value of it will almost certainly be higher (because we're still in early days) than it is now. Put it in a safe offline wallet, hodl and forget about it until you see the headlines in a few years.

The problem in a nutshell is this:
ETC survived because Ethereum has a fast difficulty adjustment algorithm. Similarly, BCH survived because it has a semi-fast (although asymmetric) algorithm. Bitcoin has an algorithm that takes up to 2016 blocks to drop the difficulty and, even then, can only make a four-fold adjustment at the maximum.
If the canonical chain dropped to 10% (that's a guess based on current intentions), block rates would go to hours and that could continue for several months until a difficulty drop occurred. If this block-rate slowdown caused a price drop, then the remaining miners could switch as well. In this case, it's not really going to help if some guy fires-up a legacy miner that's going to find a block every 100,000 years.
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:20:33
Then it's your duty to short BCH. You'll make a ton of profit and aid price discovery.
@_date: 2017-08-20 10:04:08
You're wrong. Miners running a speculative empty-block hashing round in the first few seconds after the previous block while they prepare the the real block from their local mempool doesn't impact transaction rates at all. This is a block which wouldn't have been mined otherwise - it always helps network security and has no effect on transaction rates. These are the blocks you see on the chain a few seconds after the previous block.
Now, there is a strategy which a particular miner may be using to game the system which involves deliberately mining empty blocks so as to fine-tune the block structure in order that they can use less cycles hashing it. This you can certainly view as a flaw in the system, since it's subverting the basic proof-of-work rule.
However, this flaw will ameliorated by SegWit. It would be certainly be a mistake to forbid empty blocks, since that rule itself could be gamed and, as I've pointed out, 'legal' empty blocks are nothing but a positive for the network.
@_date: 2017-08-22 09:06:57


That's not how statistics works, asymptotically, every mining node will eventually find a block. And that's not even the point: the point is that mining stochastically selects the next block creator (read that simple statement again - it's the very invention that is Bitcoin).
As I said, you can spin it how you want and second-guess what Satoshi actually wrote to your heart's content. The fact remains that validation is a pointless task without mining and is certainly not independent of miners (all miners have to validate a block before they start building on it - read points (5) and (6) again).


Who cares about a sub-reddit circle-jerk? How long have you been in Bitcoin? I started in 2010 and mined continuously until early 2014 (when I switched off the Avalon and started using it as a bedside table...). I've run full nodes (multiple ones) ever since.
@_date: 2017-08-21 09:30:14


You keep reading the white paper and still don't understand it. That text describes a mining node (the bit about 'vote with their CPU power...by working on and extending blocks' should give you a clue) not what is now called a 'full node' (which can be cheaply spun-up by the thousands, unlike mining nodes).
I would prefer not to double the blocksize now either, I think it's bit reckless and premature; but I don't actually have a choice since I don't mine these days. All I can do is choose to transact on the chain or not. Problem is I can't transact on a chain where there are no blocks being mined.
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:40:45
Somebody could do that anyway. It won't be built on unless &gt;50% of miners are actively mining that type of block. (Mining BCH doesn't count.)
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:16:52
You're right. All nodes mined in the whitepaper. If we could still be doing that, these issues wouldn't have happened. The centralization of mining is the real tragedy here. 
And it has other implications apart from how evil certain miners are in trying to force a hard fork: essentially our mining is under Chinese political control and could be shutdown with a single phone call from a government official.
@_date: 2017-08-27 11:01:56
That's your inner 14-year old talking. And you really do care about me, don't you? Yet again I say: come up with the quote or shut up. Of course you can't (either come up with the quote or shut up - in fact it's a bit too easy to press your buttons (dopamine, as I said)).
And let's re-introduce Satoshi's wise words to maybe get back on topic a bit:
"The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it."
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:46:57


Yes you did. You wittered on about fake miners and said stuff about trusting all miners or none (there's no such dichotomy - it's a trust-free network).
Read the whitepaper, do some mining, and then get back to us once you have a bit of learning.
@_date: 2017-08-21 12:48:54


Ok. Ethereum node count is a bit above 23000:
Bitcoin node count is a bit above 9000:

The majority of the nodes; not all the nodes. And full nodes are as cheap as chips to spin-up.
In the event of a contentious hard fork, there will be nodes on both sides (they're cheap, remember). The market will probably choose the side that has the economic heft (exchanges, payment services, etc), as long as there is a sufficient block rate.

Come on. Stop being disingenuous and try to have an honest debate (it's hard on reddit, I know. That's why I don't come here very often). I gave you an answer: markets decide the value and Miners mine until they selfishly decide not to.


Every block will not be rejected (there's more to this world than the reddit circle-jerk). Some people will run the new nodes. The market will then take a view on this. What we do know is that if the canonical chain drops to 10% of its previous hash power, block times will be in the hours and difficulty adjustment may take months (the market may take a dim view of that). If that did happen (I hope it doesn't), the remaining miners will see the Schelling point and jump over as well and the old chain could die. In that case it's not true to say that "People running bitcoin nodes will remain unaffected.".


Again stop persevering with this nonsense. We have a difference in opinion on how to interpret the white paper. (But, of course, by Aumann's agreement theorem, only one of us is right (that's me, by the way...)).


Ethereum has more nodes than Bitcoin (which is really a factor against your argument that the nodes define the coin - as I said, nodes are cheap). Is it that you don't think they're decentralized?
BTW, why not let's take a break from all this back-and-forth, crack open a beer (or some wine), sit back and watch the Vuelta. It's a great stage.
@_date: 2017-08-26 10:22:45


But that whitepaper you link to says:
"The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested
in it."
EDIT: If you're talking about current hashpower, of course you're right - it has to be cumulative. I do notice that certain people get excited when miners switch to other chains for a couple of hours.
@_date: 2017-08-27 09:21:33




That dopamine kick feels good, huh? You clearly do care what I want (but it's not what you think it is, I actually care about Bitcoin, for you it's just some masturbatory fantasy), otherwise you wouldn't make up lies about me. Now point to the quote or shut up. Be a good dog.
@_date: 2017-08-21 12:28:23
Well, I'll run one for sure. Just so I can split my coins in case they can be traded. I'll still be running the original one too (and I run a BCH node, again because profits).
And do you really think nobody will run a new node? (Even if they're not doing it just to split). There's a whole sub-reddit out there which hates the guts of this sub-reddit. They'll do it just to fuck with you.
@_date: 2017-08-22 09:18:23
In both these points you're correct.
@_date: 2017-08-26 12:40:50


Of course the longest valid chain (the whitepaper at least assumes that and did Litecoin, anyway, ever have more actual work in its chain?), it has to come from the genesis block and meet consensus.
And yet again we have an argument of what a node is in the whitepaper. Satoshi clearly states that these are mining nodes (although they don't have to mine). Non-mining full nodes become more common when mining started needing specialized equipment (basically from ArzFort's stuff onwards).
But anyway, that's way in the past. We are now in a situation where mining is in the hands of a few (and what worries me the most about that situation is that it's potentially under the control of the Chinese government who could shut it down at any time).
The question of whether a mining-driven hard fork could be prevented by enough full nodes refusing the new blocks is one that is really only going to be answered when it happens. Just looking at counts of full nodes doesn't really help, because they can be spun-up cheaply (as Satoshi noted in the whitepaper). There was a lot of talk about 'economic nodes' (exchanges etc) being the key in UASF and that's probably what the market will follow.
The concept of changing the PoW with an emergency hardfork is obviously an interesting one. I would be very wary of it (my feeling with Bitcoin has always been to make as few changes as possible because it's worked very well up to now), but the geek in me would certainly like to watch it happening (but that maybe is quite selfish of me because I've unloaded enough of my BTC in the past to still be quite comfortable in the event of a price crisis).
Has a client been developed and tested with a new PoW?
@_date: 2017-08-21 12:57:53
So you're saying the 'traditional node counts' only know about nodes where they can see the port. So how do you know the count for Ethereum's 'non-listening nodes' in order to assume that Bitcoin's count is higher?

@_date: 2017-08-20 11:42:39
History often repeats (maybe because human psychology is the same), so it's well worth studying it.
BCH followed a similar path to ETC after its split: initial spike because of low ask liquidity; selloff down to despair; pump with calls of "we're gonna replace the canonical chain..." (that doesn't usually happen). We're in the pump bit now. The only question is whether selling at 0.2 was a good idea (it probably wasn't a bad idea).
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:19:32


Don't be too sure. Two miners at least are signalling intent for SegWit2x on BCH...

@_date: 2017-08-19 07:56:14
BCH liquidity is pretty good at the moment (last 24h trading volume is higher than BTC). Who knows how long it will last, so maybe make hay while the sun shines...
I've been selling a bit of BCH (also actually some BTC - 4400 was too nice a price and there's an engine overhaul coming up for the gulfstream...), and it moves through blocks fairly quickly especially since its still a bit of a rump chain (about half the speed of bitcoin, but it is cheaper). There may be more miners jumping on it after the difficulty change. As always, keep informed of what's affecting the price.
This current pump was, anyway, well expected. It's almost a law of physics, which is why wise heads weren't selling below 0.1.
@_date: 2017-08-26 16:41:02


Yes, we're reaching an agreement; but many people on this forum don't get that and just look to the raw node count. That's why the big 'economic nodes' will be the deciding factor. 
Don't forget, though, that some very wealthy agents (who have already indicated that they'll take a loss to make some point) are involved in this.
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:06:22


You're the one making the claim with 'special figures'. I've shown my evidence based on public knowledge of node counts. Some simple Bayesian inference would lead us to assume that Ethereum would have a similar listening/non-listening ratio to Bitcoin. 
I'm suggesting again - watch the Vuelta. If you've made a bit of coin from Bitcoin, you're bound to have a fancy carbon fiber machine. These guys are showing how to really ride it...
@_date: 2017-08-21 09:44:56


Clearly not. You don't get that mining (proof-of-work) is the whole point of Bitcoin. It's what enables stochastic selection of block builders to prevent cheating.


As I alway said to you, read the white paper. It describes them perfectly (remember - those things that are the whole point of Bitcoin).


Nodes (whether mining or full) hold a copy of the blockchain. Only miners can extend it with new blocks. Full nodes can choose whether to accept the new blocks or not; but if they ignore a block, they might end up with a dead blockchain if no other miner steps in with the Merkle hash they need.


That's absolutely true. You need to have a copy of the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-08-23 09:45:49


Actually it was. In the whitepaper, every user is a miner. The problem with disk space used by the blockchain was to be dealt with by pruning (section 7 in the whitepaper).

You are, of course, free to make an altcoin with whatever proof-of-work algorithm you want. Don't call it Bitcoin, though.
@_date: 2017-08-20 07:42:08
The whole point of the wonderful invention that is Bitcoin is that it encourages miners to be selfish (i.e. maximise their profits), because this is what secures the system.
People have second-guessed these design decisions for years (Hey, Bitcoin is flawed! Let's have shorter block times or Turing-complete scripting or force non-empty blocks...) and yet here we are with a robust, long-lived coin with a value that is head-and-shoulders above all others.
Tinker with that at your peril. Satoshi knew best.
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:43:01
If you opened a bank in the wild west in 1830, what would have given that bank (or the currency it issued), intrinsic value? Basically, security against theft. What gives bitcoin intrinsic value is the billions of dollars worth of mining equipment and electricity that is used to secure its transactions. Miners are essentially a combination of the bank building, its tellers, and its security guards.
We could also talk about the intrinsic value of the bitcoin system (enabled by what I talked about in the previous paragraph) that enables you to transfer value securely, quickly and cheaply across the world. In that sense, we might say that its value should be similar to other money transferring systems...
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:25:34


Yea, human emotions are weird; SegWit is just a sensible compression technique. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 06:29:14


It's not and you do have a point. The problem is that the Byzantine consensus described in the paper (and the quote I gave above) is the only reliable way that Bitcoin can be run. 
The paper is correct when it says that IP addresses (and hence full nodes) can be easily faked (this is called a Sybil attack) - mining can't be, which is why it was the great invention that gave us Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-27 11:56:02
This thing is sweet to trade (of course, I unloaded my actual assets in it at 0.2 and trade on margin). There are correlations between these hashrate lurches and the price which, I think, many automated trading systems aren't using yet. Of course, overall direction is down and I like to think I'm aiding in that price discovery...
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:39:02
Shorting is fairly simple technically: you could transfer a small amount of BTC to one of the exchanges, use that as collateral, sell (borrowed) BCH at current price and buy back when it's hit your target; but if you're not experienced with it, I'd stay well away and if you want to get experienced, do some paper trades first.
I do automated trading, and my system is certainly short BCH at the moment (it was long earlier today when BCH was climbing out of the mammatus pattern, and then shorted at 720).
EDIT: BCH difficulty just went up four-fold. This is a fascinating experiment to watch.
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:31:55


For sure. Selfish miners are expected in the whitepaper and what happened was really inevitable. Satoshi saw this when he asked for the "gentlemen's agreement" not to GPU mine. (ArtForz was such a naughty boy...)
It's a kind of tragedy of the commons (economic's version of the second law of thermodynamics).

Mining empty blocks isn't ideal, but it certainly adds to the security of the blockchain, since that's one more block you have to rehash if you're mining for a 51% attack.

BTW, that link from Luke (and don't forget, this is waccy-baccy-luke we're talking about here, he doesn't get any more coherent as time passes) doesn't mention the count of Ethereum nodes at all. Why not provide a link that does? Also any comment on why Luke's count is so different to coin dance's (which claims there are 9020). Do you want me to spin up a few thousand? It's really cheap, they can share the same blockchain storage - nobody can tell the difference.

Debating with you is easy now. All I have to do is copy-and-paste this each time from Satoshi's white paper. Maybe one day you'll understand it (or do you want a coin that deviates from the white paper...?):
"The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote.

@_date: 2017-08-22 07:29:12


Mining is not required? Clearly we need somebody to mine or we won't get any valid blocks (I'm assuming you know how a block is created).
However you want to spin it, Satoshi is clear in the white paper that all nodes mine. In the early days of Bitcoin, this is actually how it was. Now, most of these (mining-)nodes are going to fail in the race to the next block; so they'll receive the said block when the winning miner broadcasts it; then they'll validate it and add it to their local copy of the blockchain. A full (non-mining) node does the same thing except it doesn't try to mine the next block.
We could have a Bitcoin network that only consisted of mining nodes (and indeed did in the early days). It is not possible to have a Bitcoin network consisting only of full nodes.
Full nodes only really became a thing when the mining arms race started to branch into GPUs and you needed special equipment to be a miner. 
As usual in these battles with newbies, a nice copy-and-past from the white paper clarifies (if said newbies actually understand it. Reading comprehension tip - when he says 'each node' that means 'each and every node'):
The steps to run the network are as follows:
1) New transactions are broadcast to all nodes.
2) Each node collects new transactions into a block.  
3) Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block.
4) When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.
5) Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.
6) Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the
chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash

You were right to be wary. The people who bought the first batch of Avalons at the start of 2013 made a packet with them (Yufo Gu admitted he sold them much too cheaply), but it was sheer luck to get one. The second batch were very slow in coming and had rather a 'used' look to them. I bought an Avalon made by a Swiss company with chips from Yufo which were delayed again (lots of companies were waiting on these chips and the bitcointalk forum was screaming). My machine made its cost back (something like 50 BTC if I remember) with a decent profit on top but nothing like the first batch. It was already unprofitable to run by the start of 2014, such was the growth in difficulty from the ASIC explosion.

They can accept or ignore whatever blocks they want.


That's a good question. In the end, of course, economics will decide. Miners will keep mining the old proof-of-work until it's economically unviable for them (Bitcoin assumes that miners will be selfish). 
It would be a mistake to assume that all full-nodes would reject the old proof-of-work (and how safe the new chain would be is another discussion - the current hashing power on Bitcoin is amazing, that can't be replicated very quickly); the very controversies we see on these sub-reddits tells us that people are divided. So the market will decide in the end as it always does. But the market has been quite happy with Bitcoin so far.
What do you really expect to happen if the 2x fork happens and 90% of miners support it? I'm interested in your thoughts on that. I'm certainly not looking forward to it (I'm always very conservative when it comes to Bitcoin), but I can't stop shit happening just by running a full node. (Of course, I'll actually run nodes of all the forks to keep my options open.)
@_date: 2017-08-21 10:55:37


Sigh... If validation (which is basically checking that the structure of the block is correct and, most importantly, that the Merkle hash is consistent) was the entire point of Bitcoin, then we wouldn't need miners at all. A centralized authority could just issue valid blocks and you would apparently be happy. Miners can't (don't) lie because it's not only full nodes verifying blocks, other miners do as well and will refuse to build on the fake block - that is the whole point of Bitcoin. So what's more important? Well, the person who builds the blocks. Without blocks there is no Bitcoin, regardless of how many full nodes are doing the easy job of checking the hash (know anything about P and NP?). Oh, and I know what a node does. I've been running them without a gap since 2010.


If I want to use Bitcoin, I must verify the blockchain and also verify each new block that a miner sends me. But it's a mistake to assume that full nodes define Bitcoin. I can spin up thousands of full nodes with a few dollars and a few mouse clicks - the number of full nodes making a statement about what kind of blocks they'll accept doesn't give you any indication of what the community prefers (look up 'Sybil attacks'). I can't spin up thousands of miners in a similar way.
Let's just finish with this quote from the white paper:
"The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making.  If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone
able   to   allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested
in it."
If you can't read that and understand that Satoshi is saying that miners define the blockchain and hence Bitcoin (you know, that bit about "proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making"), then I must despair at your reading comprehension or can only assume that you have some malicious intent in spreading blatantly false information.

He actually knew full well, but didn't rewrite the whitepaper because of it. Do you disregard the whitepaper that defines bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:45:39
(6) strongly implies that (5) talks about mining nodes because he uses the same term 'nodes' and says in (6) that 'Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block..' while saying  in (5) that 'Nodes accept the block only if...'. 
It's basic English comprehension that he's talking about the same type of 'node' in both cases.

Satoshi disagrees with you (from the whitepaper):
"The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it.""

It's a bit more nuanced than that. Legacy nodes still see a maximum of 1MB blocks because witness data is stripped out and transactions to them are smaller (this is how it can work as a soft fork). SegWit nodes get the witness data and can see blocks bigger than 1MB.

No... I've always tended to prefer what the whitepaper says and concentrated on mining nodes because simply looking at full nodes leads to a Sybil attack; but I do accept that if 'economic nodes' refuse to accept the blocks, the miners won't be able to force a change (although it could get rather messy). I seem to remember you waxing lyrical about Luke's count of "100,000" nodes (it's all in the history of our various exchanges, I can grab quotes if you really want to push it). 


It's great that you're working towards a better knowledge, but you should clarify what kind of nodes you're talking about. This will make for more informed discussions.

Whether you like it or not, 92% of miners are signalling for 2x. If they implement it, that's all that's required according to Satoshi's whitepaper. If Peter Todd doesn't like it, he can fire up a miner.

To clarify this, you only need the square root of the bits (e.g. 32 bits out of 64 bits) to find a collision of any random pair of hashes (you can't control what the hash is). To find a collision for a specific hash would still require 64 bits of work.

So is that it? Suddenly I'm an r/btc shill? Grow up. I've been in Bitcoin since 2010 and, yes, I think the whitepaper describes a great invention and I'm pragmatic and conservative in how it should be extended since it's worked great up to now.
Whatever you think about them, miners do define the consensus as described in the whitepaper (section 4), since stochastic selection of block builders essentially is the Bitcoin invention. It's also a fact that if nobody connected to the miners, they'd be useless. The Bitcoin system is the synthesis of these concepts.
Come hardfork time, if the miners play rough and really go through with it, we're going to have block times in the hours with months to retarget. What exactly is that you're suggesting with the way you want to run full nodes that will ameliorate that? (And yes, they can spin-up large numbers of their own full nodes - what would stop them?)
And just for the record, I think the 2x fork is a mad and unnecessary plan which is very risky to Bitcoin. So preventing it or making it ineffective is an important goal.

I'm afraid you need to understand those words (at least 'stochastic' - it means 'random' ('ameliorate' means 'reducing the bad effects')) to understand how Bitcoin works.


Yea, you can open lightning channels. Problem is, there's no infrastructure using them and the reputational hit of an essentially stalled chain will be significant. (Don't forget, there will be another chain running at a nice rate that claims it's Bitcoin.) At that stage, I think a PoW change/difficulty reduction might be a better plan.


Forgive me if I don't leave it to you (especially since you don't seem very technical). I'd quite like to see Bitcoin survive.
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:48:31
Bitcoin has worked great since 2009 with plenty of hostile activity on the network; it's a very robust system.
Like or not, the biggest problem after the hardfork is whether there will be enough mining activity to sustain the original chain (if the miners keep to their signalling intention - if they don't, there'll be no problem). Maybe a better thing for the community to do is to encourage everyone to mine (at a loss for most people, but that's giving something back and no different to what we were doing for a lot of 2012). I've got an old Avalon I could drag out.
In my view, the centralization of mining in China is the biggest problem for Bitcoin (it's not just that a deal can be cut with just a handful of miners, the Chinese government could take complete control of mining with just a phone call).
Maybe it is time for a PoW change.
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:14:03


I think that's fiddling while Rome burns and is an ineffective strategy. Full nodes (of either type) can be spun-up cheaply by the thousand (and I'm sure they'll do that) and the concept of 'real users' really is one of 'economically-significant' users (the same argument as used with UASF).
The only chance of not having this hardfork succeeding is by lobbying exchanges and miners not to hardfork or having significant hashrate on the original chain. If after the fork, the original chain is on less than 10% (with the subsequent long block times stalling transactions), then the hardforkers will claim victory and the markets will probably go with them.

In terms of which client people run, Ethereum is exactly as centralized as bitcoin (i.e. not very; people can choose and do).
In terms of mining, bitcoin is far more centralized, being essentially under control of the Chinese government (who could shut mining down with a single phone call).

As others have said, you must have a boatload of inputs to get such a high fee.

I asked this question of you on another thread, but you never answered it (some guy called Frog something entered into a 'dialog' instead, but he literally is as dumb as a rock and tried to insist that the nodes specified in the 6-step whitepaper algorithm were non-mining nodes...)
So, how can non-mining nodes enforce byzantine consensus?
The sub-question there, of course, is how do you avoid sybil attacks from nodes that are cheap to spin up?
@_date: 2017-06-13 15:59:46


Ok, but the problem here is that BIP148 is relying on trusted nodes (e.g. exchanges) and using that as a proxy for proof-of-work. This is backwards to the whole point of bitcoin and byzantine consensus, which was to do away with the need for trusted third-parties by allowing nodes to enter a lottery for the right to write a block based on proof-of-work.
Isn't this just the same as centralized fiat?
Also, if I were an exchange, I'd be happy to run both BIP148 and legacy nodes (like the Ethereum Classic situation). That's probably not going to help UASF succeed, but would certainly exacerbate the fork.
@_date: 2017-06-10 18:07:27


It's more correct to say users cannot survive without miners. (Of course, in the whitepaper, there's no difference: nodes mine.)
Come UASF day, you'll have a minority of miners hashing your chain. Block times will go through the roof and difficulty can't adjust fast enough to correct that. The chain will die (this ain't Ethereum with its rapid difficulty changes). Every miner knows this even if it's a bit vague to you.
@_date: 2017-06-10 17:20:44


The only 'vote' that matters in Bitcoin is byzantine consensus as defined in the white paper.
@_date: 2017-06-13 16:21:38
Well, the problem here is what a node would consider its community. Should Poloniex poll its users before it commits to running a BIP148 node? Would it be considered wrong if it didn't? And what about the problem of exchanges double-dipping and choosing to run both nodes?
I absolutely agree that Bitcoin merely has an heuristic for Byzantine consensus, but it's worked pretty well up to now. (Yes, I know some shits are stalling the very sensible SegWit upgrade, but I'm reluctant still to throw it away.)
My problem is that, while I think BIP148 has the right motives, it's just dangerous because it steps outside the consensus mechanism that's worked so well up to now and we'll end up with a forked chain (hopefully one dies quickly because difficulty can't change quickly enough (but it could still be an agonizing, slow death)), hopeless publicity and a crashed price.

Of course, we can throw around content-free statements or we could try and have a rational discussion. By 'consensus', I mean byzantine consensus which is stochastic selection of a node to build the next block in a merkle tree based on their proof-of-work. What's your definition of consensus as applied to bitcoin?


You and me both. That's why bitcoin doesn't rely on opinions, it relies on byzantine consensus. Clients are free to ignore blocks if they want, but that's essentially opting out of bitcoin.

It depends on the value of the gold coin compared to the value of the network protection (proof-of-work costs in Bitcoin's case). If the gold coin could buy a significant amount of hashing power, then yes.
@_date: 2017-06-13 03:56:01
Let me put it like this: What was the problem that Satoshi was trying to solve in the white paper? Essentially it was the 'double-spending' problem. We can sign a transaction and put this into a 'global database', but unless we have a trusted third-party administering the database, what stops us signing another transaction and double spending?
The answer is that he devised a trust-free way to ensure the database is consistent; this is 'byzantine consensus'. On every block round, nodes (miners) compete to be the one to make the database entry by entering a lottery. The price of entry to this lottery is 'proof-of-work'; and the reason to do this is to make sure miners can't spam the lottery round by spinning up multiple nodes - it's too expensive to do that. This spamming we would call a 'sybil attack'.
So when you say nodes (and you mean non-mining nodes) find the valid blocks, what's to stop them from being malicious actors? The answer is nothing (or really just a few dollars). I could spin up thousands of full nodes which ignore the latest block with a particular spend in it. You could do the same, but we have nothing at stake here - we don't have to provide expensive proof-of-work. It's the miners that keep the blockchain (database) in a consistent state, the non-mining nodes are essentially read-only users of the system.
So fast forward to UASF. Reddit users (and others) start ignoring non-SegWit blocks hoping to make this the consistent chain. But I (of course, I'm not really going to do this but somebody else can), can spin-up just as many nodes which accept legacy blocks.
The normal response from those who favour UASF at this point is say that if 'economically significant' nodes (mainly exchanges) follow UASF, then the miners will have to follow. But to say this is to rely on 'trusted' nodes - the very thing that byzantine consensus is designed to avoid. Essentially UASF is an appeal to centralization.
The conclusion is that mining is expensive and non-mining nodes are cheap. If non-mining nodes were really used to find valid blocks (and don't forget, the white paper doesn't mention or care about such nodes - it says that mining nodes find valid blocks because these are the blocks the next round is built on), then bitcoin would be vulnerable to sybil attacks - the very problem it was designed to solve.

What exchanges? I'm sure, like Bitfinex (and Polo with Ethereum Classic), they'll be fine listing both chains (why wouldn't they?). It's just that one of the chains will have block times in the hours and be vulnerable to attack. If there's one thing investors out there don't like, it's an insecure and/or stalled blockchain.
And don't forget: the original chain is the one we have now. The UASF chain will be a fork and will naturally have less legitimacy in the eyes of the world (especially given that it's not supported by the core client).

So back to the issue (I really don't want to insult you, I'd rather argue the technicalities). 
Let's just quote from the white paper (as you selectively did, but somehow missing its whole point):














Can you see from points 2-4 and 6 (notice how it says "each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block"), that Satoshi assumed that all nodes were miners? (Please look at it carefully.)
I'll rest my case there. If you can't understand the white paper or byzantine consensus, then I can't argue with you further. But please, think carefully before you follow Luke-Jr in his barmy plan.

@_date: 2017-06-10 21:23:16
Yes, of course you need both. 
To an approximation, bitcoin can be thought of as a distributed, autonomous bank. The miners are employed by the bank as a sort of combination of teller and security guard (I've seen posters here describe them as 'servants' of the users; they're certainly not that, anymore than a bank teller is a servant of the customers - they're employees of the autonomous corporation).
The users give the bank its value by putting their money in it - if nobody used it, the tellers could go home.
The thing is, a bank has to be secure and stable and most would agree that this is what you want in a bank. So can we change the bank without scaring off the users? Can users make another bank? My tendency is towards stability and I think the rush to UASF will scare users off (i.e. a drop in value).
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:11:39

I run a full node and have done so for years. I know that running nodes are cheap; you can spin-up thousands for a few bucks and so they can't enforce consensus because they're not staking anything.

That doesn't make sense as a reason for the price to drop. If people sold ETH to BTC and then BTC to USD, that would be zero-sum and wouldn't affect the price. If even a small proportion kept the BTC from the ETH sale, then the price would rise.
It's more likely that all cryptocoins are seen as the same asset class (especially to new money that's come in recently) and the sell-off is across the board. This is not surprising since they're all in a bubble currently.

@_date: 2017-06-01 07:44:44


You really don't have a clue how bitcoin works.
Let me give you a clue: difficulty can't change that quickly. It would take years for it to drop to the point where you could mine with a graphics card again. Currently (and certainly for a long time after the fork), it would take thousands of years for a single (high-end AMD) card to mine a single block. In the meantime, if you're on a minority chain with low hashrate, transaction times go through the roof and the chain dies. (If you want fast difficulty update, then coins like ETH provide that; but BTC has more conservative settings.)
This is really scary: we have a bunch of wannabe no-nothing cryptogeeks who probably got in after one of the bubbles and hold some handful of bitcoins rushing to disaster on the siren call of a zealot (who has long cashed in enough BTC to be very comfortable).
With luck, the whole thing will be a damp squib and we can avert the disaster.
BTW, I think SegWit is a very sensible upgrade to bitcoin, but it can't go in without consensus and without that consensus the safe course is to do nothing.

Let me be clear: I think SegWit is a great upgrade and the miners resisting it are shits, but I don't think this issue is worth destroying bitcoin for.

What I'm saying is that it's straightforward to run a machine for bitcoin transactions with reasonable assurance that it's not compromised.

Yet my assessment explains what is actually happening: the drop in interest rates shows that there is more money to be put to work at this current time and this is reflected in increased asset purchases across the board.
What's your explanation?

A year ago, the difficulty was a quarter of what it is now, so divide your figures by four: 2.5/4 = 0.624 and 1.25/4 = 0.312.

Yes, it's going to happen one way or another. Batten down the hatches and grab the popcorn...
Thanks for the insights.

Ad-hominem reply from someone who can't maintain the argument. As I said before, I think the miners blocking SegWit are shits (and where did you get the idea that I want a hardfork? I think a blocksize increase without SegWit would be a disaster), but the security of Bitcoin is more important than my feelings or your feelings.
Now, please try and give a technical answer (including the information you've gained from your cut-and-paste about consensus) to my point.

I think it's fair to say you don't think at all if you fell for that one.
Which bitcoin bubble did you get in on...?

How do users enforce byzantine consensus?
