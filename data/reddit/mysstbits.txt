You know what bitcoin is, it's the eternal struggle of optimism over pessimism and it's a battle worth fighting, it will be ugly and many have fallen and many will fall, they'll try and stop us but together we will reach the moon and beyond and change all that has gone before!
So just hodl on tight and let the flight begin.

I am considering using HITBTC to trade B2X futures currently @ .0225 but I'll probably end up sending most my coins to GDAX as they have stated that 4 hours after the fork you will receive your B2X coins as an asset to trade, I may immediately trade 1/2 for fiat or possibly ETH, I expect a dip in BTC the days following the fork and I will buy/trade back into BTC if or when I judge the market is favourable,  I also have fiat ready to buy any dip.
I will then make further judgements on whether to sell or trade my BTC if the market panics and I will judge when or if to trade/sell the remaining B2X assets as it's possible after the initial sell off the price will actually rise over the days following the fork (BCH did this when the EDA kicked in) though I have no confidence it will I still want to hedge against that and have some remaining B2X to trade.
Bear in mind I am not a HODLer I am a trader, I will attempt to take advantage of the market volatility to increase my coins on whichever currency is most profitably, however the ideal outcome for me is BTC wins and I have more BTC than before the fork.
I accept all the risks and anyone who follows a similar strategy should be aware of all the risk involved too.
