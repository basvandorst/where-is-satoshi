It's definitely a gamble but if it's affordable I'd do it. 
I'd say offline wallet or at least encrypted. 
I actually moved all my btc 'savings' to a non existing wallet. 
I just have a qr code above my desk which is my private key. If I ever need to get into savings I just load up the client, get the private key from my wall and import it to 'build' the wallet.dat file. 
It's a pita. But probably the most secure. (well the qr code is fancy and transferring the key from qrscan to text is done via ssh on my phone which will leave a footprint if someone knows to scrape a certain directory in my phone if I ever lose it. But comparitively it's secure)

Offline. 
Create an offline wallet. Get the private key. Write it down. Fund it. Etc. 
This is ideal for savings. If you're going to be spending I'd recommend a wallet on a USB stick that you keep unmounted and encrypted when not in use
I use an offline wallet and use blockchain.info to watch the balance. 
I'd never put a 'live' wallet on their site, but they have some really really nice features.

How is coin worker not helping. I've banked 3 btc in about a week off that site. 200pts is about 12jobs which can be done in about 5mins each for .42btc...

Awesome looking site, hopefully you'll get some more orders on the books.
I'll be happy to get away from btc-e ...that damn chat box on the right of their site was always a huge distraction/troll fest.
Best of luck to ya

I did the same thing with my offline wallet minus the last step.
I just added the pub address to blockchain.info as a 'watch' wallet. The vm that had interaction with the private key never had network connectivity.
