Let’s rather provide evidence it wasn’t bought with fake money and that tether and other stablecoins are 100% backed and won’t cash out the bitcoin they bought with unbacked assets and take out dollars in the process. 
And that exchanges like Binance have the funds to return to everybody and they aren’t pumping their own token with customer’s coins. 
We want transparency but there is basically none where it matters.
@_date: 2019-06-17 13:17:11

Not much of argument. Wait for what? Why don’t I wait for the 2nd coming of Jesus to know if it’s real? 
I have holdings, I am just not a moonboy living on blind faith, that’s the difference. People calling for 1m just want to sell for fiat to somebody else who will tell others it’ll go to 10m. 
Use some objectivity. I don’t go around selling pipedreams.
@_date: 2019-06-16 11:59:31
Clearly only few people want it and those who do want to flip it to somebody else for more dollars.
@_date: 2019-06-07 15:21:46
Bro, whatever, would be nice but I don’t want to live in fairyland.  BTC doesn’t just hit 100k , the correct sentence is “Who will buy bitcoin for 100k thinking it will go to 200k?”
@_date: 2019-06-07 13:13:55
Because not every goddamn poor-ass dreamer on Reddit calling for Lambos is gonna get one. For price to raise you need people to buy Bitcoin way above your buy-in price. So who is gonna buy your bitcoin at 100k a piece so that every other person and their cousin are going to buy Lambos in 2 years? 
Get positions in projects you want to hold, just remember it isn’t a sure shot and if too many people are thinking Lambo, it’s likely prices will drop again.

We barely saw a few years of trading, you are basing calls to 1m dollars on nothing else than past performance and hope, while past performance is not an indicator of future results. 
You tell me to dyor while it looks like you know squat.
@_date: 2019-06-16 23:55:20
I see no line of people buying. I just see a machine sitting there by itself.
@_date: 2019-06-17 18:05:50
Sure it looks like it since its dollar price is all that matters to holders, but prove me wrong.
@_date: 2019-06-17 13:40:54
More likely than not, it’ll go lower than 7k.
@_date: 2019-06-10 18:04:26
The company works out their costs and their profits, so...is macdonalds going to pay cow meat in bitcoin? And Burger King? And the rest of them all? Yeah, right. So the meat producer will pay for land and pasture in bitcoin? And if he isn’t happy he’ll move because he wants you to be rich with your bitcoin? They don’t give a shit, dollars is as good as it gets for those in profit. 
Get real and wait decades for that, and even decades it’s a maybe.
@_date: 2019-06-07 13:36:11
Lots of assumptions there. 
First of all, being scarce doesn’t mean being demanded. 
If demand grows specifically for bitcoin, at what price will demand stop being demand for bitcoin and become demand for fiat, that as we stand is the monetary system, and I don’t see it changing for a long long time. If you have proof that Btc is going to replace fiat within a matter of years, post it, as I don’t see it. 
If bitcoin will be bought out of necessity, how come I see prices for goods in dollars and not in bitcoin?
We are talking many years if not decades away, so I’d be careful with such a speculative asset. 
If you wrote here just to have more confirmation bias, then go on and buy it all.
@_date: 2019-06-17 18:22:20
You failed to prove that bitcoin isn’t a ponzi or that it has any inherent value. Holders only try to have other people fomo in, in order to sell for more fiat, and that is its value, which is that of a ponzi. It only has the brand name to make it special, since blockchain technology is what matters, not bitcoin. 
Let’s not bullshit each other here.
It can get you rich, if enough people buy it and get the prices high, but let’s call it for what it is.
@_date: 2019-06-08 20:42:04
Ifinex has tether for that.
@_date: 2019-06-17 14:48:24
Yeah, they are stupid and you are very smart.
@_date: 2019-06-10 17:13:08
So what can I buy that is produced and sold in bitcoin? Not one thing.
@_date: 2019-06-07 21:36:15
I want to smoke what you’re smoking because that is wishful thinking and imaginary prices you are talking about. In your dream to be rich, you forget to use logic. 
With BTC at 1m volatility won’t be 10% because it would crush like the twin towers with the amount of holders cashing out. 
Jesus, don’t you just see how stupid that is?
Maybe in 20-30 years if it takes over the entire world, but even calls for 100-200k are a joke within only a 2-4 years span, you can buy a house with that amount of money, so are we all going to be millionaires? Maybe, but not so soon and probably not.
@_date: 2019-02-26 14:37:12

Have you ever stepped foot outside of your neighbourhood? 
Have you ever spoken to somebody outside of the 1% belonging to rich western society and asked them how they’d buy potatoes and tomatoes with bitcoin? When they have no cash to buy a phone, let alone investing and doing KYC on Coinbase?
This kind of shitposts are only here with the intent of selling bitcoin for more dollars. 
Make no mistake, you only advise people to buy so that you can sell at a profit in dollars.

@_date: 2019-06-04 12:52:51
Easy, they use fake money called tether, same as how they pump btc these days. Also, what you just described, they use your funds to make trades.
@_date: 2019-06-11 17:29:42
So let’s stick to tether? Because fake money is what’s keeping bitcoin afloat since December. Can interest come back? Definitely, when the space in cleaner and more secure.
@_date: 2019-06-07 19:43:32
Sure because you are smart and everybody else is retarded. �� People will buy 1k of bitcoin to make 1k when its price goes from 100k to 200k a piece. You either got to be trolling or are just plain stupid.

@_date: 2019-06-08 07:54:57
LOL keep smoking that opium, you might want to review your TA because there isn’t a single thing pointing to 100k or 1m but ‘past performance’, and you know what they say about that. 
TA is actually showing a breakout from yet again an ascending triangle, a bulltrap and a bottoming pattern yet to be seen, alongside a long-term EW abc correction. 
As well as much longer cycles, not shorter. How the halvenings will play out is yet to be seen and how the market will absorb MtGox’s tokens or some of those hundreds of thousands held by Bulgaria, or the 2016 Bitfinex hack or the tether fake dollars collapse, is also yet to be seen, because I am sure as hell current volume can’t withstand any such move.

By the amount of downvotes, we have a few millionaires in the making by the eoy. ��
Of course it can all be made safer but the hurdles ahead aren’t few and demand needs to be there, while among regular people I don’t see that demand, yet.
@_date: 2019-06-07 14:41:15
You assume I wasn’t buying at those levels. 
Also, the only people advising others to buy now are those who want to sell their coins for more dollars. For. More. Dollars. You don’t care about financial revolution and neither does OP, otherwise he wouldn’t be so focussed on price and on it being higher next year than now. 
So it proves my point, you don’t want bitcoin, you wants people to buy it off your hands for more dollars. You want the dollars and the lambo. LOL
You are in for a rude awakening. 
Lastly, I won’t reply to retards and fomomonkeys anymore so that’s the last you’ll hear from me.
@_date: 2019-06-07 16:02:47
So, you don’t understand the difference from 1000 to 100.000? People can spare 1k, at the most they won’t buy a new phone. 100k is an entirely different animal.

That’s the point, it’s a catch22 that is basically unsolvable presently. Take fiat out of the equation and there’s no comparative standard to bitcoin or anything else’s value. I don’t see it happening, maybe in decades it’s solved somehow, not sure how.

Thanks, however we don’t need the establishment’s shoe-polishers to teach us anything about crypto. Looks like fud-fuelled propaganda. 
Example: “Forking has become so common that it puts at risk the notion of limited supply altogether.”
Actually, no it doesn’t, journalist moron. I can make a copy of a unique, original Matisse painting, but if nobody buys it, the value will remain 0. 
It would be best if people realise that forks like BCH should just be dumped to 0 immediately after trading starts, better if not listed at all, or just let the market will decide their value by trading them if somebody is willing to list bitcoin forks. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:27:25

Yeah, I just fail to see the correlation if you put up the entire chart for the last few years. Putting this one up like that it’s basically just fud.

Get rid of the dollars, people. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:01:43
Flat earth is also a theory. But I get your point, it’s more likely weak hands that have over invested and capitulation was due anyway, before an uptrend. Last time it went down 85%, so from now to 3000k it’s fair game.

@_date: 2019-01-08 11:06:19
You asked the question. Ask yourself when you will be ready to pay btc 20.000 dollars because it is going to 40-50.000-100.000. If that is not the general mindset, it won’t go to 20k. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 13:13:36
Don’t get scammed by bitmex.

Aren’t they from India or some conservative country?
They made it feel like anybody I know would care to shame me for jerking off while nobody cares around where I live. ��

I know. It says 3 months, the headline of this post is fake news. It says “banned”, they are not. Eventually they might be in 3 months if no change comes around. So, yes, it’s fake news.

Yeah. It’s fake news.

Bitfinex buying with tether and soon selling for fiat. Everybody cucked.
@_date: 2019-05-09 07:22:43
Because this is an artificial, no volume, manipulated bulltrap organised by whales trying to exit tether and especially bitfinex. Arbitrage bots pushing price up on other exchanges.
@_date: 2019-05-10 10:11:36
They buy because it’s the only way to get funds out of bitfinex. Lol
@_date: 2019-05-24 13:18:37

You haven’t seen it? Must be blind.
@_date: 2019-05-10 08:13:32
That’s exactly why it’s going up, Binance blocking withdrawals while people buy bitcoin on Bitfinex to get out of a failing tether and get their funds off the exchange. Arbitrage bots doing the rest. Fakest pump of all times.
@_date: 2018-12-21 18:41:22
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:48:58
This isn’t the US dollar. Lol
For bitcoin to be widely used price will have to raise as there isn’t enough to go around. 
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:06:59
Don’t DCA at the top of a fake tether pump. 
20WMA is barely at 5k.

I am sure they use Monopoli money.

Why you want to buy into a scam?
EDIT: Sorry I read Bitcoin Cash lololol
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:53:09
I want to use it but my BTC is worth more than its current dollar value. 
If I can buy something with BTC worth 1 cent per satoshi than I’d consider. 
Otherwise I’ll just keep spending Fiat. 
@_date: 2019-05-11 18:35:17
People getting scammed left and right by fomoing into a clear fake Chinese pump.

Lol no
@_date: 2018-12-28 20:45:26
That’s not an invention, if anything is an application of crypto to an existing idea. An invention would be a new bidding system altogether, for instance. 
@_date: 2019-05-24 20:34:01
No, it’s gonna come down. Try when weekly stochastic RSI is in oversold territory turning up.

All women are essentially prostitutes. Some you pay with money, some you pay with attention, time and presents. 
Also, if you are looking to pay a woman to have sex with you, that makes her a prostitute. Where the fuck is your logic?!
Leaving that alone, you can find the finest, sloppiest escorts for 150-1000 euro an hour. A whore that you pay 1000 euro an hour hasn’t been with 400 guys lol

Start here but don’t limit yourself to these two: 
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:39:19
They could simply be traded at lower prices since price has been going down?
@_date: 2018-12-11 08:41:34
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:16:56
Yes. You wait for the stochastic weekly RSI to come down and turn back up. 
Or you wait for rejection of 100 weekly MA. If It goes above that and above the monthly 20 MA, consolidates and confirms support, then you can buy in a little bit, maybe 30% of your investment.
Remember the higher the fomo you feel the closer we are to the top.
@_date: 2018-12-01 16:28:31
Hype, lol. What a retard. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 18:01:29
