Hodling isn't bad, but the extreme lengths that BTC investors are going to in order to keep people holding onto their investments is likely to be contributing to a bubble - whether this is a short-term or long-term issue remains to be seen.
Not that I'm complaining, I want it to keep going forever!

Classic derailment of a lost argument. Try getting back on track, if indeed you are able to produce a counter-argument - please do try, I would be very interested to hear what a "philosopher" has to say on the matter.
@_date: 2017-09-11 18:54:27
I'm going to give us asking. Thanks for trying.
@_date: 2017-09-11 17:46:47
Yeah, that's how science works - look it up.
@_date: 2017-09-11 17:05:17
Wow, still staying away from the argument! Never mind, when you get back to discussing the topic rather than trying to distract everyone from your lack of counter argument let me know - happy to discuss any time!
@_date: 2017-09-11 17:47:25
Again with the ad hominem. 
This was the argument, in case you missed it:
"In both cases we are dealing with investments in something that has no or little intrinsic value or use."
@_date: 2017-09-11 17:15:00
Not true, though I can understand why you may think that.
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:01:26


In both cases we are dealing with investments in something that has no or little intrinsic value or use. It's not like a house, that you can live in, or coal, that can be used to fuel stuff. Also in both cases we are dealing with something that has suddenly risen in value after much discussion and hype. 
I'm not saying they are the same, far from it, but there are some definite similarities, and I would like to know more about the differences between the two and why Bitcoin will retain the bulk of its value in contrast to the crash experienced at the end of tulip mania.
@_date: 2017-09-11 18:44:50
Haha nice. So this is your rebuttal to my argument? I would have thought that a philosopher would be able to do better than that.
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:29:52
You can't trade a dead currency either. Try selling some Italian Lire on the open market!
@_date: 2017-09-11 18:30:02


Do you mean like "What makes Bitcoin different to Tulipmania?"
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:13:51
Again, I'm not talking about similarities between bitcoin and tulips, I'm asking about the similarities between bitcoin and tulipmania.
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:22:55
Of course are are. What intrinsic value does a hypothetical product have?
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:00:15
OK, so I'm right that science starts by disproving a hypothesis or I'm right that I started this thread with a question? 
@_date: 2017-09-11 14:39:32
Trying not to sound pedantic here, but I'm not asking about bitcoin vs tulips, I'm asking about bitcoin and 'tulipmania', of which there are several obvious similarities. I would like to understand why the 'Bitcoin bubble' (as it's frequently described, not necessarily correctly) is different to the 'tulip bubble' in the 17th century.
@_date: 2017-09-11 18:40:35
No, I'm repeatedly asking you to rebut my argument. You keep refusing. I wonder why that is.


Again with the ad hominem.
@_date: 2017-09-11 17:54:06
Oh man, of course it does! Literally, the only way you can do anything with science is by disproving a hypothesis. You create a hypothesis (i.e. Bitcoin is similar to tulipmania) and then attempt to disprove it - you then draw a conclusion from this.
I don't actually think Bitcoin is the same as tulipmania, but there are clearly similarities, which is why I asked the question on here.
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:13:01


No, they were all backed by gold when created, not simply created out of thin air. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:10:14
Thank you for this answer, it is a better and more explicit version of what I've heard people talking about before. My only real question is regarding the scarcity - while Bitcoin may be (currently at least) limited, I presume there is always the possibility of other cryptocurrencies, potentially newer and will more advanced technology, being released that effectively means there is a limitless supply of cryptocurrency in general. Is that correct, and would that have an impact on what you are saying?
@_date: 2017-09-11 16:00:47
So, you lose an argument and result to ad hominem attacks. Good for you. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 16:17:49
You'll probably get a better return over the next three months than if you invest in Bitcoin. If you're in for the long haul though, Bitcoin would be a pretty awesome bet.
@_date: 2017-09-11 18:32:54


Wow, more ad hominem attacks. Look up the definition if that helps you. I'd like to know your 'rebuttal' to my argument that:
"In both cases we are dealing with investments in something that has no or little intrinsic value or use."
Do you have any argument against this or are you going to continue with the ad hominem attacks?
