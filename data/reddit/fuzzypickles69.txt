The original connecting cable that Satoshi Labs included was of poor quality. They included a new higher quality cable in my purchase... I just can't remember if it was within the box or not. It's possible they opened boxes back at the place of production to include the extra cable. Was your holofoil sticker broken?
One comfort though, is that if the trezor has been physically compromised you should be able to tell that the trezor faceplate and /or backplate probably wouldn't fit back together exactly since it's tamper resistant.

Sanders is proposing to increase taxes on the lowest of earners more than 10%!!! Bernie belongs to the top 5% of earners and he paid a total of 13%.
What Bernie paid IN WHOLE is almost as much (sometimes less even) than what he is proposing to INCREASE on the POOREST PEOPLE IN AMERICA. 
He's a poverty pimpin thug. 
Edit to add:
He *could* choose to stop sending weapons to ISIS, and stop drone bombing brown people indiscriminately, but instead he would rather INCREASE THE TAXES ON THE POOREST OF AMERICANS TO ROB THEM FURTHER.

They hacked my e-mail first. I got popups on my phone of them trying to log into Poloniex, BTC-e, Finex, Bittrex, Coinbase, Circle, Paypal, and others. All were stopped by some security measure except Bitfinex who processed the withdraw within minutes. It's certainly my fault for not using 2FA (it was a new account and I hadn't turned it on just yet). But I am disappointed that they immediately processed a withdraw from an IP address that had never logged in before.

@_date: 2016-12-18 07:34:43
There's actually rarely a problem in getting confirmations. The only time it's slightly delayed is when Roger Ver or Jihan pay to send a bunch of spam transactions to create a non existent problem. Segwit will soon put those clowns to sleep though.

Trezor is the best.
@_date: 2016-09-09 16:35:59
Just be happy you got paid at all. 
Selling BTC on eBay is dangerous.
@_date: 2016-09-29 18:14:09
When you spend from the Trezor you use the little onboard screen to confirm the transaction and then push a physical button to confirm.
The HW1 does not have a screen or physical buttons. Instead when you spend from the wallet you have to use a card with a code on it. 
It will present the address, for example. "1F1tAaz5x1HUXrCNLbtMDqcw6o5GNn4xqX" but it will identify a character within the address - like this:
"1F1tAaz5x1HUXrCNLbt * M * Dqcw6o5GNn4xqX" where the M has asterisks around it. So you would look on the code card and see what letter/number corresponds to M and enter it in the prompt. It will ask you to do this 3 or so times before it allows you to send the transaction. This is required to add a physical element to the process to prevent hackers. 
@_date: 2016-09-29 17:08:34
Only use online / local wallets for petty cash. For €1000 you need to purchase a hardware wallet.
Bitcoin Trezor is my favorite (Around 90$)
Ledger HW1 is a good cheap one (around 15$) but takes more time to spend from it.
Ledger Nano looks promising as well but I do not own a nano myself.
These devices keep your private key offline and safe from hackers. You get a "seed" when you setup your hardware wallet which you can use to replace your hardware wallet should it malfunction or get stolen, burn up in fire, etc.
If you keep your Bitcoins on a hardware wallet and keep your seed somewhere safe (bank deposit box?) you are safe from virtually everything.
I would suggest using Coinbase or Circle to buy the bitcoins.
The hardware devices can be purchased from amazon.com or purse.io if you would prefer to use Bitcoin (discount too, I think.)

Once she called the team together to delightfully and laughingly tell everyone how one of our older employees hadn't been coming to work because they had a heart attack and had passed away.

Contact an exchange and arrange to purchase increments. I would purchase a Trezor before hand, and understand how to use it. With your trezor seed - email half of the words to yourself. Create 2 copies of the remaining half of the words and store one half in a bank deposit box and one at home, or elsewhere. 
Holding your Bitcoins at home on a trezor and using the method above will be your safest way to store your Bitcoin for the long term. 
* Safe from Banks &amp; negative interest rates
* Private
* Cannot be stolen by someone breaking and entering into your house and stealing your trezor. Half your seed is stored online.
* Cannot be hacked from somebody online because half the seed is not online at all.
Storing your winnings this way will protect it from inflation, thieves, hackers, fire, and governments.
Best of luck and congrats on your win

My coworkers hear me talk about Bitcoin a lot. They know I trade it and that you can use it to save money shopping online. I gave one co-worker around $20 in Bitcoin on Purse.io to try when BTC was around $200. Presumably, it's now worth around $45 or so. That person now harasses me on the daily (not Bitcoin related) and tries to make every day even worse for me. I don't support implementing chargebacks in Bitcoin... but...

VISA losing money means that it's NOT SECURE. It just means they are making more than what is being lost by using an insecure system.

Almost all the nodes were being hosted by the same few people. They were using free cloud hosting trials across many spam accounts. When you set them all up in one day... well... you see what happens when the trial ends. :)

I downloaded steam when I heard they were accepting Bitcoin and have since purchased 2 games.

I've went weeks with only spending BTC, never touching fiat. I use Coinbase and the shift card they offer.
