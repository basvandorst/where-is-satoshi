CO2 lasers dont engrave metal like you think they do.
OP used a product on the metal (ex: cermark) that the laser bakes onto the metal.
The engraving wouldn't survive a fire like cryptosteel would.

Quote: "If you have a Bitcoin wallet, then the company (the owner of the wallet) has the same obligation as the bank to know who the owner is. We can follow these activities. We will work closely with G20."
Easy: I have a bitcoin wallet. It's a piece of paper. I am not a company, but I am the owner of the wallet.
So, now you're asking me if I know who the owner of the wallet is ?
Yeah, this is gonna get ugly in the future when they're starting to understand the tech.

next: only government is allowed to mine, and the fees ARE the taxes.

All these employees should strike until they lift the ban. Or better yet, buy lots of crypto's, untill the strike date.

Do you know how to make a small fortune in aviation?

Keep a minimum of crypto on exchanges.. put the rest on a hardware wallet.
Updates are being rolled out as we speak.
I think there is a higher risk of another exchange hack right now.
ex: An exchange running in the cloud could have its (=your) private keys exposed.

Not everyone's native language is English...
Be happy that we put in the effort. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:20:42
I agree :)
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:36:07
Same boat!
I told my wife about this post, and that we are not alone :D
Didn't get a significant response.
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:29:08
I'm expecting more of an exchange hack.
Exchanges that are running on a cloud service would have all of their customers private keys exposed.

if they ever find Satoshi private keys and dump all the coins... we'll be stuck in a bitcoin ice age for years.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:56:29
yes, passport verification still times out. :(

Actually, when you think about it, a lot of bitcoin will actually die along with the person holding it. My wife only knows that I have invested a very small amount. But it's gone when I die tomorrow.

stopped watching when he mentioned that he works for goldmoney.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:57:23
Exactly! :)
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:20:26
i agree.. but as a noob, it was challenging to get into XRP.  coins are still on an exchange in stead of on my ledger.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:03:23
yup, stuck at passport here as well for 3 days.
gonna send them a picture of my naked butt next time, just for the fun of it /s
I'm on bitstamp now.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:14:34
predicting and hoping for it as well... watching all day already. 
I wish i could predict the WHEN part :)
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:13:06
twitter page mentioned heavy maintenance for the last couple of days.

at this point, BTC is my gold, and ETH/LTC my currency.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:24:48
no.. 5btc still there: 
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:42:41
why would he, he wants to push Alipay. 
With all the bitcoin momentum, Lightning Network needs to be implemented fast. Otherwise we lose the trust of all the mainstream people who bought into it.
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:00:40
It's the same with stocks isnt it. Replace cryptocurrency with company on a stockmarket.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:12:16
it depends, it probably opened their eyes, and have a better security policy now. I'd rather pick one that has been hacked before, then others who are maybe ignorant and "about to get hacked"
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:21:18
nah, i'm getting used to waking up in the morning with less profits. :), I'm not expecting it to be any different tomorrow morning.
It's all about managing expectations :D
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:11:55
infinity divisible?  i thought only 100.000.000 satoshi in a bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:09:15
great! so in theory we can have microSatoshi's in 2025 when the world economy transfered to bitcoin! :)
