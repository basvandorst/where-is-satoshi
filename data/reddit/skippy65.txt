Yeah well if you actually did your research youd know that the system is build so that it can afford paying so much out, and besides that theyre making way more on you than you are making on them lol.

Are you fucking crazy? It's bound to dip soon, don't buy 10k worth of btc now. Just look at what happened few days ago, reached 12k then flashcrashed to 8.7k. After the flashcrash is when you want to buy.

If you're quitting your job because of BTC, you seriously need to reflect your life choices again. You obviously aren't working a job you love doing then.

See you in 2040.

Buy when it dips*

It's because blocks are getting overloaded. Wait a few days until it resolves or buy ETH to decrease transaction fees.

I mean they're called donations for a reason. The people that donate bitcoins shouldn't ever expect to get it back...
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:47:42
"60% of the transaction". Lol? 
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:56:09
Why /s? I mean people literally make money over stupid people like this.

The fact that people can't see OP is baiting worries me.

Most wallets allow you to dynamically set fee. As far as Im up to date tx fees of 10-20 satoshi/B seem to get in the block now. So if average transaction is 225 bytes, would be around 2250-5000 satoshi tx fee.
