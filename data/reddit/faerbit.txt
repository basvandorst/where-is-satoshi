Confirmed accounts have a blue check mark next to them. So if someone reaches a certain publicity(which Elon Musk certainly did) and doesn't have a blue check mark next to them it is almost always fake/parody.

Now that you pointed it out, it bothers me why I didn't see this at the first time. The arm way to small/compact to be doing that kind of stuff. 
Maybe I didn't see it because this is totally doable with todays technology.

PGP is very easy to setup and use with something like Enigmail. The only thing that is complicated is finding a keyserver respectively finding out on which one is your recepient. But I imagine that would be solved if it would be widely used.

The password on your wallet encrypts your private keys. If your using a client on your computer this password protects your keys from getting stolen from your hard drive. If you are using a online wallet a good password is even more important because everyone can try at any time to login into your wallet. The private keys itself secure your bitcoins, and because they are totally random and very long are nearly impossible to guess/brute force. I hope this clarifies things and didn't confuse you further.
