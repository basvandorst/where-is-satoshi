Media could lock Dorian in a room. Give out some information somewhere online and have the real Sakamoto re-post it while monitoring Dorian to make sure he does not have acesss to this information or anyway to post it.

Dr. Oz is a a sellout doctor who appeared on Oprah.
He has his own show now and is famous for peddling all kinds of dubious, fraudulent and downright dangerous alternate medicine.
Things like homeopathy, faith healing, antivaccinationism and even psychics.
It's all the more baffling because Penn and Teller and spend quite a bit of time emphasising that these ideas are bullshit.

Australia has a card (Citibank) that lets you withdraw money from 7/11's (and post offices) at the xe rate with no fees.
Besides, 7-11's are everywhere (except Aomori) and are 24/7.

It is incredibly serious and risk the whole future of bitcoin.
The whole point is for it to be distributed, GHash.IO are pretty much the central authority/controller of bitcoin at this point.

I predict it will fluctuate between 1 dollar and 500 million cents in intervals linked to the digits of pi.
So 3 mins at $1, then 1 hour at 500mil, then 4 years at a dollar, then 1 kalpa at 500 million 5 days at $1 etc

They look really interesting, I wish I could buy one in Australia. 
We have a spring mattress on the floor, this thing looks like it'd be a lot better instead. Reminds me of Japanese futons too, which I like.
Also I really like your work with BTC
One thing I do note though is that you say "No marketing gimmicks" yet your prices are all XX9 or even X99.
$499, $399, $349, $249, $199- seriously?

@_date: 2013-12-09 02:35:16
Fair enough, nice to see you've done some research.
Seems a bit silly though. 
Of course 199 would be preferred to 200. Who would pick 200? It's $1 more expensive!
A more valid question might have been 199.99 or 200- something that makes no difference anyway. Perhaps some other way to control it, ask 99 taco's for $99 or 100 for $100?
Round numbers look a lot cleaner to me and I prefer them, It's amazing that retail pricing has influenced us so much that 200 looks more weird than 199.
Target started selling shirts for $6 and $10 flat recently and specials at Coles and Woolworth's now often list things at $14 or $10 etc. No decimals. I think it's a refreshing change though no doubt they've done their research to find that this new way entices people to buy anyway.
So what can you do
@_date: 2013-12-09 14:17:29
Ah rats!
The concept and interface look very nice at any rate.

We got 300,000 signatures on the keep the Australian NBN change.org petition (NBN = National [FTTP] broadband network). That's equivalent to 4.5 million people in the US.
The liberal (conservative) party's Malcolm Turnbull told us all to fuck off and they continued ripping up the fibre optic cable and our NBN anyway.
So yeah, fat chance.
