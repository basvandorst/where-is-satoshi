It looks like its jammed with Ads. That look permanently in place. You could have a donate with BTC/LTC and run a Ad every 5 minutes. 
I will not download this for a few reasons.
1. The font used in your screenshots are awful. I get it your thumbnail is awesome. But Readable text man, its like Reddit switching to comic sans.
2. This is your first app. That's awesome but, 
*System tools*
*test access to protected storage*
I rather you did not have access to my protected storage, for testing proposes or not.
I hope you do carry on creating and making your apps better but for now I don't feel I can download your app.
PS. Your User handle SPITAJoke kinda also makes your development look shady

That will be due to the fact you more than likely get Fibre-To-The-Cabinet (FTTC) which uses fibre to that point then routes that connection down a copper line. 
Virgin uses "Fibre-To-The-Home" (FTTH) which is coaxial cable from the cabinet (which equals less interfere) to the house. This allows for faster speeds, less to none interference with electrical equipment in the area, the signal does not get dampen unlike copper which is know for drop outs after you are far enough away from the exchange. And finally No phone line needed!

Zero Line Rental, Unless you opt in for a landline! I use to be with Sky on Copper (ADSL2+) My Avg Ping as around 20-30ms and I lived about 3-5 miles from the main exchange. This was the time when they was using BT Openreach.

And for the typography:

Still not a fan of the font.
Want some tips:

Not all UK Service sucks (Unless you live in Kingston-Upon-Hull where your doomed) Virgin Media/NTL have stepped there game up on Fiber to the Home (for £19 a month total cost for 2 years, I get 100Mbps Down and 10Mbps Up)
BUT FUCK COMCAST

Got a few paper backups in 2 to cities (Family Member House, Who is trusted and a copy my wife stored and a copy I have stored) also will be doing a few usb backups onto sd cards and pen drives. Covering all roots.

I'm trying convince my boss at my restaurant to implement it. Although most our clients are old or "rich" people
