So at what point does this subreddit realize that 'bitcoin' benefits a small few.
We know majority of coins are held by under 250 individuals and now the network consensus in the hands of 10 representatives.

Chinese business practices allow for deception, once they realized the bitcoin.com domain is a money making dud they stopped paying.
The bitcoin ecosystem has not produced a single trustworthy entity nor individual to date.

Bitcoin can also be thought of as a call option on the growing cybercrime economy which needs a *conduit* to get fiat money. Bitcoin fills that niche perfectly. People on here actually believe the hundreds of millions in exchange volume is from legitimate ventures(that they can never provide proof of) while in reality it's from the explosive growth in cybercrime. No legitimate bitcoin use case that is sustainable has gained traction in 7 years.
So many in bitcoinland just caught onto a trend they were either ignorant of or just seem to pretend is not true(due to the negative stigma).
The problem in the fiat system is since it is based on trust, it requires *prudence* to work properly. Since prudence is a moral virtue and capitalism is anti-thetical to morality, the powers that be attempt every other method(technocratic) at managing the system while ultimately building a foundation on mud. The second issue in the fiat credit system is compound interest. No productive force in history has kept up with the grind of compound interest, this leads to the inevitable boom/bust cycles and 'debasement' of the value of the fiat credit. 
I agree with your gold assessment. What the government actually did was try to force the system to stay on the gold standard in order to protect bondholders and it was like swimming against the tide until they finally caved in while causing massive economic destruction in the process.

No, just good old fashioned wealth transfer scheme.
@_date: 2015-12-06 11:12:28
So with ChangeTip failing we quickly move to the next shill bot.
@_date: 2015-12-10 15:36:15
Agreed. It's incredible that libertarians on here want to pass the costs of their transactions onto other people. 
@_date: 2015-12-11 15:25:19
And what exactly are the point of these?
@_date: 2015-12-11 13:02:06
50% of the transactions occurring on the network are under $1 in value.
Gavin Andresen is just desperate to stay relevant at this point. Hearn is still bitter about causing the 2013 fork.

You weren't using bitcoin. You were using dollars that someone gave you in exchange for the bitcoins you sold on Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-12-07 08:31:58
So you sold bitcoin for actual money and then went and spent actual money. That does what exactly for bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-12-10 14:23:40
Because Bitcoin has always been a wealth transfer scheme.
*Think* it through. When you buy a bitcoin, someone is selling on the other end. The seller gets your actual money. So who has all the bitcoin supply? Those who mined large amounts when they were easy to get. The *work* required to get the initial bitcoins was so low that early adopters amassed hordes. Artificial scarcity is just a method to protect the early adopter holdings, it has no basis in any coherent monetary science. *Money* scarcity is related not to an artificially imposed limit but to productive assets backing new issuance. Therefore money does not need to be kept scarce for it to have value. When money makes contact with human labor new surplus value is produced. Bitcoin is the very *anti-thesis* of money, it's designed to swell the hoardes of those who have large amounts of it. 
TulipTrust is the accurate name that Satoshi gave to his enormous stash of bitcoins. Some estimates put this stash at 1.5million BTC or $600million+ USD worth.
Those with a vested interest in keeping the scheme alive such as 'VC's' and the early adopters will keep trying to brush this off as just a rumour. 
Start using *reason* to think things through. Bitcoiners prey on the uncontrolled passions and emotions of people to blind them from what this has always been about. Transferring wealth from 1 group to another.

Satoshi also designed bitcoin based on a very crude understanding of money. What exactly are you trying to get at? You finally realize Satoshi is not God?
The bitcoin ecosystem is a bonefide *nightmare* for the vast majority of participants. The few who got in early and were able to successfully navigate the scams are now rich based on the collectively pooled money the received from everyone else.
Satoshi applied a crude understanding of money on top of a crude understanding of human psychology to create bitcoin. The cesspool we call the community is living proof of these mistakes. 
Computer people think only in 1's and 0's, which is the exact anti-thesis to how actual humans think and behave.
What bitcoin has done is boostrap an entirely *new generation* of the same old scams(ransomwhere, ponzi schemes, boiler room scams, theft, deflation, porn, gambling).
It can be mathematically proven due to the concentrated nature of bitcoin ownership that more people have been impoverished than liberated.

I agree, as long as the fiat credit system remains in its disasterous state, that is without a 'moral compass' to supervise it, bitcoin will have a huge role to play.
The less trust in an economy the more *primitive* the economic exchange. Bitcoin harpers back to the concept of a 'barter good' acting as money instead of trusting the future productivity of labor(credit). 
So yes the 17th century concept of the centralized nation state as arbitrate of trust is becoming more and more obsolete thanks primarily to moral decay and major changes in communication technology. 
That being solved, bitcoin does not solve *any* of the issues that plague the present system, instead it reverts back to a more primitive form of money as a solution. Maybe thats a good thing? More people are questioning the entire deluded doctrine of all progress being good.

This is a bitcoiner throwing a new barrage of made up terms at you just to sound like he knows what he is talking about and to distract from the issue at hand.
@_date: 2015-12-11 16:48:57
I thought one of the strengths of bitcoin was that I did not need to trust a third party to 'vouch' for them?
Amazing how this community is sitting on modern communication technology, yet apply 'innovations' from the 15th century.

Vessenes owes the foundation close to $18,000.

Coinbase shills have been active on this subreddit for years.
It's a shitty service that requires you to hand over personal data to an unknown firm that then hands it to various government and corporate entities all the while limiting your interaction with bitcoin.
Again, whats the point of it?
@_date: 2015-12-10 12:49:00
Doesn't it all make sense?
Wright was a scumbag and the community is packed with them, so 'Satoshis' fingerprint is all over the place.
@_date: 2015-11-30 11:33:51
Practically impossible. Try acquiring any decent amount of bitcoin and the price volatility skyrockets. Bitcoin is not liquid enough to act as a reserve asset.
@_date: 2015-11-30 14:32:23
That makes no sense.
You can't 'put money into bitcoin'. You can only give your money to someone in return for bitcoin.

Neither Coinbase nor Bitstamp matter, that is the reality of the situation. In 2-3 years Bitstamp/Coinbase will be relegated to the dustbin of bitcoin exchange history. The cost of compliance outweighs any income they earn from trading fees. 3 years ago people thought that Mt.Gox was all that mattered and here we are doing just fine without it.
