Ouch, that will make it more difficult than it needs to be, good luck.
Next time, you may want to try localbitcoins.com first, if you don't have anyone exchanging locally then you should explore some of the payment options available to you on  Once you have a more transferable, less reversible medium, join the  IRC channel on freenode, and there you should be able to find someone trusted to exchange with you. You can find out more about this bitcoin over-the-counter exchange @ 
Don't respond to unsolicited PM's, &amp; report them to the OP's. Make sure user's are verified by checking with ';;ident IvyReddit'. Don't hesitate to ask the channel for help, or ask about a particular user. Non-malicious actors will not get angry &amp; will not only understand, but encourage it.

I'm looking forward to seeing the conference online(hopefully), I wish I could make it. I would love for this to boost local interest &amp; catch some attention. I will take this fitting opportunity to plug my attempt to spark interest &amp; provide some resources for my fellow Chicagoans &amp; suburbanites. I would love to see some activity over there besides myself, I think a localized community could be beneficial.

This is a good time to remind everyone, Best Buy will price match with big retailers. This includes Amazon if it says it is "**Fulfilled by Amazon**" under the price.

Not that I know of. Typically you would want to be on a reliable and well connected machine. The primary issues being, no static IP, hardware size constraints(20gb blockchain), and mobile ISP data limits.

is a subreddit I created awhile ago, if you would like to add it I would be thankful. It's not popular, but AFAIK it's the only Chicago area subreddit. I made it in hopes it might bolster a stronger local community, and give locals their own discussion area.

 I had a similar experience. I posted the advertisement on LocalBitcoins and within no time I had been contacted by the buyer. The process was extremely smooth and I felt secure throughout the exchange. I had funded the transaction, met up, and released the coins, all in a about an hour.
 Despite being his first exchange(First time using bitcoin?) the transaction went well, It may be intimidating at first, however once you go through the process you'll realize it is fairly straightforward for both parties.
 The buyer ended up asking if I had more for sale, sadly I didn't. We ended up exchanging  for future transactions and I looking forward to doing business with him again.

First of all I would also like to suggest 
 I also suggest checking out  on the freenode IRC server and hooking yourself up with a Bitcoin-OTC nick.
 If you have never heard about Bitcoin-OTC, it is an "over the counter" marketplace, or person to person, similar to LocalBitcoins, however you are not limited to fiat, and it isn't as focused on local exchanges. It's essentially a marketplace in a chat room with an integrated Web of Trust rating service. 
 This allows you to complete transactions and know roughly who you are dealing with, based on previous ratings if any, all while hopefully gaining reputation in the process. 
 This may also seem intimidating at first however it allows you to streamline transactions in the future, as well as mitigating risk during future exchanges. If you need assistance feel free to consult the wiki on

I saw max usage of around 700MB this time around, while building the database. Once the database was built, subsequent launch times were about 30 seconds, with ram usage at about 200MB. It's a massive improvement!
