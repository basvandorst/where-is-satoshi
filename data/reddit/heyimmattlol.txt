As you said, one of the most important (and indisputable) advantages of Bitcoin is the ability to freely (in all its definitions) exchange money to anyone, anywhere. This is why I believe Bitcoin will stand the test of time.

Actually, these aren't related at all.

Hahaha, I support this.

Congrats OP!! My brother owns an NSX, and he loves the shit out of it. It is extremely awesome. I'm sure you will enjoy it just as much, especially since you acquired it with the profits from Bitcoin!

What do the numbers on the right side of bitcoinwisdom represent? Can anyone break them down by column?

You don't think the People's Bank of China banning cyrptocurrency exchanges has anything to do with China's lack of selling, do you?
Sarcasm aside, how would someone from China exchange their bitcoin for a fiat currency?

I lol'd. Sounds like there are some smart people in St.Louis. I live in the south and no one has ever initiated a conversation about Bitcoin with me. As time goes on, I bet this will change.

I'm taking this article with a large grain of salt. Although I do believe the USD isn't perfect and is being inflated by the Fed, I believe this Russian politician is biased against American currency. A full collapse of the USD in 3-4 years seems very unlikely due to the intrinsic global economic influence the USD has on several major currencies.

This is catchy. Sounds like you had fun working on this.

In a few years, maybe.

This is hilarious, I love Bitcoin satire!

I have also been buying bitcoin through my credit union and I have not received any negative correspondence yet. I would be surprised if they did -- they should realize that placing limits on MY money would give me an incentive to withdraw all my funds.

Very noble thing to do. Good on him.
