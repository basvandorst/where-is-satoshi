In this market order books can be manipulated. The long term trend of btc is up and it will be for a long time in my opinion.  These books show heavy resistance at 13k but if we pass that( which we easily could) next resistance is at 15

You could come the same conclusion if you knew how bitcoin worked. A lot of great stats are on blockchain.com. If you really want to learn for yourself then just read read read. Bitcoin is gold but there is so much more in this market.

EDIT EDIT EDIT: It’s the only way you make it in this market.  
EDIT IV:  If you trust bitcoin learn the potential of blockchain 
EDIT V:   Research and buy coins that will actually change the world 
EDIT VI:  This is a simple step by step way to become knowledgeable and not have to make all the options you have on this sub the result of every headline you see.  Please research and by research I mean read.  Think about how 48 hours of reading over a month or two could change you knowledge level from beginner to at least novice or at least make you not sound stupid when you post on here. Wish I could tell you how many people talk shit about the r\bitcoin sub
