It takes two to transact. Consider the other side of this transaction: why would anyone with money want to hand it over to someone they didn't know or couldn't even hypothetically confirm the identity of?
And this is tied in to your second point, "lending is debt, that's totally different." To which I will say, there is a debt in *almost every transaction.*  One party exchanges first, usually money in exchange for the promise of a good, so to return to the previous paragraph: why would I hand you money for the promise of a good when I don't know or *could not know* who you are? Answer: Many people simply won't. And more importantly, *should not*.
r/bitcoin and the talk forum are filled with stories of people who got scammed because they forked over their bitcoin to some anonymous 'merchant' promising them xyz. You *cannot remove* trust from the transaction and when you have true anonymity, you pretty much remove all trust.
@_date: 2016-08-29 15:51:29


Anonymity is not how a *transaction* works, though. As a landlord would you rent to an anonymous individual? As a bank, would you lend to someone you knew nothing about?
Transactions require trust, and that very frequently but not always, involves knowing the identity or at least theoretically being able to determine the identity of your counter party.

Bitcoin's security properties?
1. Bank balance: Bank secures it. FDIC insured. I keep records and have recourse in case they fuck up.
2. Credit card balance: ditto.
3. Private/real property/stock ownership: Generally registered. If someone attempts to possess it, I demonstrate ownership in the registry and the state secures it.
4. Personal property: I physically secure it. Theft or I lose it, I have some recourse with the state and private insurers provided I can demonstrate ownership.
5. Cash: I must physically secure it. Some recourse in the event that it is stolen depending on proof of ownership.
6. Bitcoin: I must secure it. I know a little about the software involved (wallets/blockchain/key generation), and maybe a little about the operating systems involved (Windows, Linux, Anroid), but generally speaking, I can make no guarantees I have done any of this correctly.
Given this list of security requirements, bitcoin is pretty clearly the worst choice on the list for most people.
Bearer assets in general are a terrible way to store value since they are the most vulnerable.

Thinking back on it, there were a handful of international ATM charges when I couldn't find a partner bank in a region. The only reason I needed it was that I had my wallet stolen on a previous leg of the journey. The bank mailed out an on-the-spot 24hr emergency CC/bank for free, delivered to the concierge. I just couldn't get cash in that area without visiting a non-partner bank.
And I think I paid a wire transfer fee once in 2007, but really once you have a lot of money with the same bank they tend to waive those. Just ask.
But in the long-run, not really any charges. Not one cent in financing charges. Not one low-balance charge. Not one credit card fee. Not one ATM withdrawal fee or out-of-network fee (except the ones above). Not one overdraft fee (despite 2 or 3 overdrafts).
I don't really understand what people are talking about when they say their bank has fees. Get a different bank. I have one credit card and one bank card in my wallet. The CC gets me 2% cashback and the bank card gets me 1% interest. Almost no liability. Combine that with Square or Dwolla or Apple Pay / Google Pay and I can't fathom why someone would want to use something like bitcoin. Why deal with the extra liability? Unless you're trying to get something that *cannot* be paid for with a CC or regular currency, and then the only use case that is coming to mind is buying contraband on the internet.

Ask around. Try credit unions and private banks or service member banks (USAA, Navy etc if you are in the military). Single purpose accounts for CC(Discover, Citi) or high interest savings (Ally, HSBC etc) can be great deals, but then your across account integration can go clunk.
My setup is a private bank for atms, a checking account, modest savings, retirement, investment, and customer service. The other institutions for high interest savings, CDs, and primary CC (high rewards).

It changes the enforcement. If someone breaks a law in violating your trust, you can go after someone via an identity. With some voluntary identity there *is no third partying* guaranteeing the details of that identity. It's just voluntarily presented.

And perhaps more importantly, the information required to guarantee **a** transaction gets into the block doesn't exist.
We do know the fee of the those in the last block. We *don't* know if these fees reflect the WTP of those submitting transactions in the last block (as the lost block may not have been congested, bidding the WTP wasn't an ideal strategy). But still we tend to use the actual fees as a proxy for the actual fees in the next block. Assuming two major details: the parties are similar and congestion doesn't impact this.
A better metric might be to look *only* at fees for congested blocks. then we'd be reducing the assumption set a lot.  But even then, we never know who it is that wants to get into the next block.
Other problems
1. The mempool is public, presumably it is subject to bid-sniping for fees.
2. Zero length block mining
There are some major problems that arise from block congestion.
@_date: 2015-06-10 06:53:12


That is just it. Fees are relative. In order to keep spam down fees must be comparable in size to the smallest transactions *utilized as spam*. And that is a figure that miners need to guess at.

Interesting, yes. Value added as a means of exchange, not so much.
Bitcoin has some use cases but as a means if exchange it is pretty terrible compared to other products. It has one maybe two advantages over other methods(can be relatively quick, does not require a 3rd party) but is completely hamstrung by all the other 'features' that come with it.
- you have to secure it
- no tech support
- no reversibility
- network backlogged pretty frequently (not instant, not feasible for mass adoption)
- has not been adopted &gt; still need intermediaries to use it day to day, and you'd better believe they are taking their cut

**There is no fee that can guarantee a fast transaction.**
Example: Take the extreme to illustrate the intuition. There is only one transaction per block. That is the block-size limit.
You have two pairs of transactions submitted to the nodes on the system. There is *no strategy* that will get them both in the same block.
There is, however, a strategy that will get one of them in the block, always: bid just over the willingness to pay for the other party. This requires your willingness to pay is higher and knowledge of the other party's willingness to pay.
To generalize to larger blocks, you need to be willing to submit a fee just over the willingness to pay of the last transaction in the block. When you apply the same strategy to all agents, you might imagine ranking the WTP for each party, then there's a cutoff at the block-size limit, the rule is then, bid over that last guy's WTP. **So the question then becomes, how do you know the willingness to pay of the last guy in the block? And the answer is, you don't, because different people are in every block.**  So there is no rule.
But in general during congestion there is no strategy that will work for everyone since by definition you have to leave transactions in the mempool.

If you get in a major contract for business, say building a power plant or a building a major piece of commercial real estate, then you are going to be signing a 30-50 year contract fixing the denomination of payments.

They have to pay the electricity bills. If net present value of the [(expected reward)*exchange price - bills] is greater than the bid price from the buyer of the ASIC, then they'll hang on to it. 
From a theory perspective, you'd expect that the ASIC will be priced at its NPV, and therefore there is no incentive to buy or sell (eg: equilibrium).
So the only real question that remains is: do you switch it on or off? That depends on whether they make a positive income stream.

You are conflating the distributional effects of our monetary policy (point of entry) versus the aggregate effect of monetary policy on the price level.
Interest rates can and *have* been low for a long time without any measurable uptick in inflation. The error in your reasoning is likely the failure to account for demand for money. Expansionary policy is almost always coincident with a decrease in demand for money. That's intentional. That's the point. That's why it's not usually inflationary.
Inflation doesn't cause low interest rates. Low interest rates *might* cause inflation, ceteris paribus.

I was using "adoption" to mean use as a currency.
@_date: 2014-10-26 11:43:09
This is a speculative opinion, but here goes: I think the bitterness between bitcoiners and alts is fueled by the extremely low adoption barriers between them. It really is technically trivial to accept alts if you are already accepting bitcoin as a method of payment. Yet I think coiners need some rationalization for holding their particular coin so they just go ahead and lean in to 'network effect.' The irony here being that the network effect really just supports whatever your local fiat currency is.

There is a negative feedback in the mining market until the the decrease goes into effect.
Explanation and effect:  difficulty goes down when miners shut off. Before miners choose to shutnoff, we expect the ones who will shut off to be selling every coin the produce. In this sense longer confirms are one indicator that at least some mining participants both can't carry a position (hold btc)  and are not cash flow positive.
The gist of it is that a lot of miners will chase down the price to recoup losses, at least until the difficulty change kicks in.

Currencies are usually judged on the basis of the underlying economy that uses or issues them.
Trade surpluses, monetary policy, forward interest rate curves, etc.
Since Bitcoin is not a currency of any nation, nor is it used in a predominant place (or even in a very documentable way), it should be judged like other types of money: Friction/Adoption. Volatility. Velocity.  Etc.
It is demonstrably volatile. It is relatively low friction (in transaction), though good luck getting people to accept it (adoption, which has been getting better), and the kicker: there is a holding cost.
Securing one's own bitcoin is neither trivial nor costless as demonstrated by numerous blame-the-victim responses (in and talkbitcoin.org) to people who've had their coins stolen. And if you use an intermediary, then there's not much point in most of bitcoin's features.
Probably most importantly, there's no real evidence that people actually use it as a currency. Average bitcoin days not destroyed (something I calculate) is around 550 days. That is the average last-sale a bitcoin is 1.5 years. This is hodling. Not currency behavior.
It's also deflationary be design, which has been demonstrated to be a problem for money in general (unless we're dealing with libertarian fantasy economics).

The network runs at: 194x10^9 Mhash/s, Or: 194/1792 x10^9 = 1.08x10^8 W or **108 MW of power.**

You're right. Here we have bitcoin trying to compete as an anonymous store of value and in practice it fails. When compared to things that *are* used as relatively anonymous stores of value, it can't compete in terms of price.

Well thought out. And all of these issues apply to bitcoin itself, to the extent of which money is property. 
I'm thinking mainly of number 1: If everyone knows that Alice had ten thousand bitcoins stolen by Bob, there is no way for that to be reflected in the blockchain without forcing bob to sign it back over. Even if it's all public knowledge.
And that's what money is, public recognition of a balance or exchange represented by a ledger. The blockchain is that ledger, but it's an (arguably) broken one if it can't accommodate for theft.

The remittance service in the Philippines (started by I believe), is the area I am most optimistic Bitcoin might succeed in.
Other than that, I am very pessimistic about Bitcoin's mainstream adoption. Benefits are too small, risks and unknowns are too high for the average consumer. Very few people want to saddle the risk of managing their own cash even if it might mean 0-1.5% cheaper prices at merchants. Theft protection offered by credit and banking companies is just too convenient, and private key management just too novel/ frightening for the average person (who if they have the average computer probably already knows they are inept at managing their own security).
But for the segments of society that regularly use remittance services, they are frequently charged +10% for transferring money internationally. There is certainly a large enough incentive there to encourage large scale switching *if* Bitcoin can legally circumvent those costs.

One counterexample disproves a logical statement:
premise =&gt; consequent
If you find an example where the premise is met but the consequent is not, then you have disproved the statement.
currencies =&gt; exhibit deflationary spirals
Bitcoin fails to meet the premise and therefore cannot serve as a counterexample: it is not a currency. It is not a unit of account.
I think it's also important to point out that in reality, data is blurred by observation error, so using counterexamples is also blurred by error.

Shit I don't have my PhD yet. But give it a year.
It's a test of a random walk plus drift/trend.
The left side of the ~ is the regressand, in this case the first difference (diff()) of log price (l_price). It represents the return in percentage terms, of bitcoin prices. My data is daily, so that's a daily return.
Essentially what I'm testing is if the return is non-zero and if so, what is it? So if you'll recall your business math for compound returns (or biology for natural growth), A = Pe^rt and I'm solving for r. If r is zero, it's not exponential.
In the case of the current calendar year, r is indistinguishable from zero ( p value ~ 0.31).
In the case of previous years, r &gt; 0 can't be ruled out.

Debt instruments can be pretty useful in stabilizing future value.
For example, loans work to ensure that economic activity will exist in the future by obligating the borrower to work into the future, whereas the debtholder receives the payments on the note. The payments on the note have their value stabilized by fact of the very existence of the debt: the debt guarantees an economy to spend your payments into.
This is a useful concept to grasp and perhaps more easily seen in a money free example.
You have capital now as a product of your labor. You lend it to someone on the promise that they will utilize the capital and grow it, returning some and then a dividend.  That promise of future labor is a way you can transfer wealth (and in particular services) across time. Which is very important.

That's called a competitive market.
In equilibrium, it is expected that miners will add hashing power to the network *until* their electricity costs equal their expected block reward. The reasoning is very straightforward: if someone can make money adding a machine, they will. Therefore we reach the point where the last-man-in earns no money. And very likely since bitcoin attracts all manner of enthusiasm, that last-guy-in is probably losing money.
Mining is ultimately only supported by the price level in the rest of the market eg: demand. Right now demand appears to primarily be coming from hodlers. There is no bitcoin economy to speak of outside the black markets.
I expect that even a small downward price shock will lead to even more chasing down the price from miners, and an era where the only floor is once again set by black markets (such as in the Silk Road days $1-$80/coin).

The whole extra hassle of ordering BTC every payroll period. That part.


A check, envelope, stamp, and paystub costs like $1. There are payment services already that will save you the time and mail the checks out for you. Also, no one uses wire transfers for payroll. They use ACH and SEPA which are free.
Now think about bitcoin and imagine the *at least* 0.35% fees you're going to incur on the exchange.  For anyone earning any income over minimum wage those fees are going to massively outweigh the cost of cutting a check.
There is a reason most people think bitcoiners are out of touch with reality, and this is it: bitcoin does NOT save anyone money.

As for limiting access to cash, this can't be done until banking and credit access improve significantly, which itself would involve major reforms. When and if it did occur, most households would be completely unaffected, with most of the impact probably between 80th to 95th percentiles of net worth (large enough to have big cash balances and yet not have too many investments). The 50th percentile and below in the US have no net worth to be affected. ~ 30th-95th percentiles the major investment vehicle is home equity, also unaffected.

There will be roughly 100 million troy ounces of gold mined this year or about 115 billion dollars worth of gold at bullion rates.
The value of the extracted gold is roughly the same as the value of the inputs.
This is the exact same equilibrium that bitcoin is approaching. So sayeth the marginal principle of economics.
Granted, both should include the carbon cost, but good luck passing a carbon tax.


Bitcoin, in absolute terms, has more illegal transactions conducted than gold. I believe just the silk road was doing $40 million /month when it was shut down. And when you handicap for market cap, that ratio is hundreds of times worse.
As for transaction cost, I could drive 10 miles to a bullion dealer and get $15k worth of gold bullion today for a 2% spread. I in fact, did so roughly 9 years ago.

Each element of your statement is well defined and testable. I can verify that numbers are odd and I can check that they are prime. Then I compare the result to the logical consequent of the statement and invoke the information as a counterexample. 
Bitcoin is not in fact used primarily as a currency. Nor is it used as a unit of account, and therefore it does not meet the premises of the economic statements regarding deflationary spirals: **currencies =&gt; exhibit deflationary spirals. (Notice this only applies to currencies**). So the fact that bitcoin does not demonstrate a deflationary spiral is irrelevant and does not qualify as a counterexample because it fails to meet the premise: it is not a currency.
@_date: 2014-08-26 12:34:15
The service provided by Bitcoin to its users is the ledger in the form of transaction recording.
The natural metric is to cost average over the services provided to users.
And before say, "but, but, coin creation." You forget that coin creation would still occur if there was just a single machine on the network. And you also forget that from the perspective of users, coin creation is a *negative.* It's an additional cost that should be reflected in a falling price of bitcoin (eg: inflation).
Coin creation *is how the electrical costs get paid*. From the perspective of the users, it is a cost. From the perspective on the miners it must be greater than the electrical costs or they will stop mining.

No one keeps significant fractions of their worth in dollars. No one uses the dollar as a store of value.

The bailout (specifically TARP) cost taxpayers nothing. 95% of the loans were paid back and the charge offs were easily covered by interest. Taxpayers *made money* from the bailout. And that's not even considering the whole point of the bailout in reducing systemic risks.




Strawman, you're shoving words in my mouth.
@_date: 2016-01-16 13:29:05


Yes. It makes the asset considerably less attractive to hold.
There are valid reasons that people do *not* hold large quantities of cash or gold.
Likewise for bitcoin. The difficulty of securing one's key and the uncertainty that comes with not knowing if you've properly secured it


But to get back to your initial criticism: 




This may be a goal (we may debate the degree to which it has been achieved) but it does not get around the point that I was making: my balance is going up, my dollars are secure. I lose no time trying to secure a private key. I risk virtually nothing with any counterparties (still a big problem in the BTC world). And these differences exist *precisely because* bitcoin aimed for the properties you are touting. They are not useful to a great many people, they are *costs.*
To make the claim that this is somehow offset by the fact that governments can't seize your cash is to worry about a non-existant problem (at least in my country).

Possession of a key is not actual ownership in any legal

If you want the fastest possible example of why key possession is not ownership, imagine that the theft of a key is witnessed. Whether by force or hack. The perpetrator is known. The evidence clear.
No court in the world would recognize the claim of the perp on the bitcoin despite having a new private key at an address they generated. Nor should any of us.  Same deal with classic bearer asset (cash) when you think about it.

But I do have direct ownership. Ownership *is* the social recognition of the right to dispose of/use/allocate something. Ownership is my neighbors, my family, my friends, my government, recognizing my right (don't believe me, then try [imagining the absurdity of claiming a right of ownership when no one else recognizes that right](
What I don't have is direct control.
Trusting that we are individually more capable of securing a bearer asset than a bank is capable of securing a fiat(word?) asset is definitely falling Dunning-Kruger territory.  The *vast majority* of individuals, including highly educated individuals, are incapable of sufficiently securing their personal platform to the extent that banks are capable of securing money.


Correct. It's for people who are more confident than they are intelligent.


Historically, banks *got rid of* their bearer asset base layers. They got rid of bank notes and other forms of interbank payments because they were too risky.
If you think it's bad for an individual to make a mistake, banks and institutions *really do not want* irreversible mistakes.

Yes. And what I'm trying to get across is that this doesn't matter. Even if you could update the transaction fee in queue.
You have a codified strategy to respond to this transaction fee volume, but this doesn't help you if the attacker's strategy *changes*. That's what I mean by dynamic equilibrium. If every wallet has a different fee strategy, there is 1) no guarantee of stable equilibrium, and 2) I think it's actually impossible to construct one that *guarantees* only user transactions go through despite attacks.

1-40 minutes for a single confirmation, versus, 2-10 seconds at a CC POS.


Except all the time and effort needed to secure your hot wallet, and always with that nagging uncertainty that you don't actually know how the underlying software works.  Merchants will *never* accept BTC directly if they can't sufficiently secure their keys. This is a cost that is frequently glossed over in r/bitcoin.


This isn't a major problem ([.07% of credit card volume is fraudulent]( I've had a credit card for 14 years, zero fraudulent charges have been made in that time. Also, consumers bear no direct liability for fraudulent charges. Given that every cost is passed on to consumers, I think I'll take 0.07% higher prices in exchange for not playing Russian-roulette with hacking and scamming galore in the bitcoin world.

That's the crux of the matter and why no dynamic equilibrium can be reached in the event of an attack. Wallets can be coded to respond to certain conditions with a dynamic fee schedule (fee ~ F(congestion, and other fees being paid)), but knowledge of these response functions immediately makes them vulnerable to the next attack. 
There will always be a delay between the exploitation of any dynamic fee schedule and the implementation of a new one.

- One cause of WWII were harsh debt repayments demanded of Germany for WWI.
- A Greek exit from the euro would be pretty disastrous for the EU. The EU formed out of a commitment to avoid future armed conflict by tightly binding their economies together, making it both structurally difficult to go to war as well as less palatable. A blow at the EU is a blow at 70 years of peace efforts.
- Lack of spending in the present will crush growth, and Greece is already at Great Depression levels of unemployment


That is not what bond rates indicate. Greece's ten-year bond yield is 11.5%. Factoring in a modest inflation in the euro(assumed 2% based on other European bond yields) it suggests (1.115-0.02)^10 -1 = 47% **Edit** ~~chance of default~~ real return. Given that a bond is preservation of wealth, this implies 1.47(1-risk of default) = 1 = &gt; risk of default is about 1/3 **End Edit**. Maybe a little less.
No. A Greek default is *not* assumed as a certainty by markets. Not by a long shot.

Cash reserves are to buffer cash flow, not to replace it.
Ideally cash reserves are as tiny as possible. With the business being self perpetuating, income balancing outflows.
Saying, "it's a great idea to just watch money flow out and hope Greece lets me collect the euros later," is to ignore that your company is taking on far greater risk and will otherwise cease operating once your cash accounts are empty.
A) Operate in a place without capital controls indefinitely.
B) Operate in Greece until your cash runs out.

That's not how bonds work. Payment currencies are specified in the contracts.
What could happen:
1) New currency replaces Euro balances within Greece at rate R drachmas per Euro
2) Drachmas establish market rate with Euro at rate R' where R' &gt; R. Demand for Euros is guaranteed because international import (to greece) markets and existing bond contracts require Euros.
3) Greek buying power is essentially cut by R - R/(R'-R)
4) =&gt; Greece is better off accepting a deal involving a penalties not exceeding R-R/(R'-R)
Greece will probably take a deal. Note: I don't know how estimation of R or R' proceeds, but this is the calculation that the Greek finance minister should be running.

Draw a box.
The box is Greece. Outside the box is the rest of the world . Net demand for bitcoin inside the box goes up. Local btc provider acquires bitcoin from outside the country, BTC arrow into the country. Fiat *must cross the border* or the market segments (price difference between BTC in Greece and BTC outside of Greece).
I ask, yet again, how does fiat get across the border? Capital controls are in effect. Withdrawals are limited. Money transfer is monitored or on hold.
Yes. The foreign country operates the ATM. How does this operator, legally, pull the money from the ATMs and use that money to pay for bitcoin abroad?

That you didn't bother to personally look at the name of the business/proprietor as you walked in the door, is wholly irrelevant to the point I'm making. You either missed my point or are being deliberately obtuse.
**The fact of life that you are weaseling around is that you don't interact with a single anonymous business.** It might seem irrelevant to your transaction, but backstopping all of our transactions is the potential that we *could* if needed sue the shit out of these businesses or subject them to the criminal justice system if they failed to deliver. Or, in the libertarians case, punish them via a yelp review.
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:36:46


That's not what's happening.
Currencies are markers for real things: goods and services. Currencies need to be stable in the short-run to enable the transfer of those goods and services.
Economies grow. The amount of goods and services is larger over time.
Therefore the amount of currency needs to grow if there is to be any stability. 
Economies also shrink. Therefore the amount of currency needs to shrink to maintain stability.
The **edit: supply** of a currency in circulation should be matched to demand to ensure price stability.
What should the target be? Given that when the fed changes the overnight lending rate, the changes in currency supply are not 100% predictable (since supply and demand are not known instantaneously, but we usually know on which side we are erring).
The fed needs to choose a target for managing the money supply against a growing or shrinking economy. Any amount of deflation leads to more deflation, it's a negative feedback: the economy shrinks as people "save" more money, then prices fall further =&gt; more saving, etc. Inflation tends to be a bit more self-limiting.
So the feds choose a target money supply that is slightly inflationary.

I could change every instance of "bitcoin" in the OP's post to "beanie baby" and the argument would still be just as valid. Which is to say it's an incoherent, raging non-sequitur of an argument that could apply to any bubble.

- There's just a few million **Beanie Babies** with some balance. As most **owners have** multiple **Beanie Babies**, it is safe to say there's mostly 5 million or less **Beanie Babies owners** worldwide as of today.
- World population is currently over 7 Billion people
- Many (most?) of the world's population has struggled to get access to technology and communications, but that is quickly improving in many parts of the world.
- **Beanie Babies** were invented just 6 years ago.
- **Beanie Babies** as a new and unprecedented asset (currency? commodity?) started at value $0
- **Beanie Babies** are now worth &amp;gt;$2~~00~~ USD a piece
- In spite of the really minuscule overall ecosystem, some of the most important companies and individuals in the world have started to pay attention (Microsoft, Dell, Nasdaq, NYSE, etc.)
- **Beanie Babies** have properties of currency, commodity, store of value, communication protocol, trust protocol, etc. Maybe the first thing ever to have all this together.

Argument: Merchants are quite capable of but seldom actually offer separate pricing for separate purchasing methods. Yet we're supposed to believe that people will flock to bitcoin for the 1-2% savings over CC that merchants will suddenly discount.
Argument, follow up: Net savings of bitcoin transfer cost over interchange fees is mitigated by 1) credit card rewards programs 2) the aforementioned non-trivial cost to store bitcoin (it's 100% you at risk, unlike a credit card)

I was an early adopter of Google Wallet. I had it two years prior to Apple Pay's debut in October of 2014. About 30-40% of small businesses in my region had NFC point-of-sale devices and for all but one vendor out of maybe 7, it just worked, even if the cashier had no clue about it.
Then Apple Pay came along and three or four companies just decided to shut off their NFC payments on *the day* that Apple Pay came out: CVS &amp; Safeway, I'm looking at you!

A valid point. And I want to see where digital bearer instruments go.


Does not follow. Still has all the drawbacks of bearer instruments.


True. And I believe that is mostly a legacy of the current ACH system and I believe that will vanish with any future overhaul of ACH.
Even without a fundamental overhaul of the ACH backbone we're already seeing a lot of the use case for Bitcoin being subsumed into ACH backed services like Square and G-mail's method for sending cash.


I have Google Wallet too. It's amazing, easier and it's besides the point. Because it's *also a feature of centralized credit systems.*


I don't pay a merchant in ruppies/shekkels/rands whatever just because they let me. I pay with a credit card because it's convenient for me, because it protects me. So I believe you have cause and effect reversed: merchants adopt POS systems because yes, low cost, but also because they are demanded.
[As WordPress has demonstrated]( it takes both consumer interest and low cost to maintain bitcoin as a payment method. No consumer interest: no adoption.


What? As I said, if I have no cash up front incentive and a higher amount of at-risk cash... oh whatever, let's just see what awesome innovations are going to make up for this.


I think holding the poor hostage to advertising while allowing the wealthy to skip advertising would create a lot more animosity towards content owners than it would revenue.

This is basically the same argument I was making: the price premium in shops for using CCs essentially covers the risk of fraud. I generally agree that prices for services must at least cover the costs.


The point you are generally trying to make is actually a relatively well known problem in game theory. Partial information regarding risks in insurance or cost averaging systems leads to a sort of paradox. The paradox hinges on whether the insurer or the user can identify relative risk of different groups in the population. If the lower-risk users can self-identify, then they will leave. Raising the price for the remaining, yielding the insurance (or other cost averaging) kind of void. It is a valid criticism. 
But the example you used is not very clean. I'm in less agreement with it because the risk in one system (apple pay) is not directly comparable with the risk in another system (Bitcoin). Systems like Bitcoin *are much harder* to secure than the Apple Pay client side. Since not only do you have to secure the device from skimming style keyloggers and trojans, but also from all the user actions that are now irreversible. They are open to additional risks such as I clumsily put it, "punching in the wrong address" (what I meant was C&amp;P from the wrong tab/merchant in your browser, [which if is to be believed, seems pretty common](
Yes, in general for a particular set of risks and a particular set of skill your example could yield bitcoin as the appropriate choice. But I would argue that it is only for an incredibly tiny subset. Tiny enough to create a massive disutility in adoption (currencies are only really useful if they are accepted by all).

@_date: 2015-02-09 15:51:33
Yes it does. It completely obviates your point. 
Bitcoin *does not* make it significantly harder to get caught for committing crimes.

When blocks are full and nodes implement fee prioritization for transactions, that expectation doesn't hold. Transactions can remain in the mempool indefinitely provided enough new transactions are coming in with higher fees.
This is the whole point behind increasing the block size.

If you break out something like the IS-LM model you'll see that cutting the "weak (but still efficient) businesses" destroys net productivity from the economy. 
And this doesn't just "lower the amount of mindless consumption" it lowers *all consumption*. One person's consumption is another person's income after all.

Control and ownership are not the same thing.

The discussion is how costly morality is.


Uh, most of the time they do. The majority of moral reasoning is carried out with [consequentialist ethics](

An argument that applies to every other alt.
@_date: 2015-02-12 15:32:21


Sure Bitcoin offers some benefits (to merchants mostly) and introduces costs to both merchants and customers: securing your own keys.
That's a real cost. In this case it is probably a cheaper cost than hiring armed guards, but it sure isn't clear that BTC is cost competitive against banks or credit cards in general.

OK. Let's recap that argument: Our demographics are changing, therefore the policy is unsustainable.
Which is a great argument.
But, policy makers are not beholden to freezing policy in time forever. And they aren't idiots. The benefit age is already being raised, and will probably be raised 3-6 more years before I retire.
SS is already solvent, and can be made solvent indefinitely with an appropriate choice of benefit age.

Due to convex utility curves (eg: risk aversion), the outcome of everyone self-insuring is that everyone does less business. It is strictly worse off than explicitly insured or cost averaged methods of securing cash/credit/ other assets.
Or to put it really clearly. It is better that everyone pays 2-3% higher prices than it is to use transaction methods that shift protection costs to individuals (eg credit cards are better than cash or bitcoin).
@_date: 2015-02-12 14:49:11




Well, there's that, and then there's counter-party risk.  None of these businesses are going to be solvent to pay out on claims in the event of major price swings. Short of a deep future's market, no one can guarantee value.

Edgy bro. Let me ask you, have you ever written your rep and senator on this topic? 
@_date: 2015-02-19 12:28:41


Policies can create criminality, but the resulting criminality is not the only factor in the policy.
Had Ulbricht been hosting a marketplace for stolen goods, that too would have been a prohibited marketplace which would *also* necessitate criminal self-policing. And yet the fact of the criminal self policing does not and should not make theft or fencing or creating a marketplace for stolen goods legal.
Oh wait a minute, people did [fence stolen goods, weapons, and child porn]( on the silk road.
So while drug prohibition probably creates more problems than it solves, and drug prohibition certainly doesn't have very many good arguments for it, it is still pretty obvious that the Silk Road should have been shut down under many other, much more justified, laws. I'm not saying Ross deserves 40 years, or whatever they're going to throw at him, just that it's fucking ridiculous to defend a black market because *most* of their goods were something you and I think should be legal.

@_date: 2015-02-01 15:44:52
What? I've been reading and bitcointalk.org for a long time and there are plenty of people asserting this.

And importantly the shape of the utility curve.
Benefit and cost in this sense is seen as gains or losses in utility. Utility is a transformation of the goods/assets into that-thing-the-consumer-wants. Utility theory is used because it predicts many of the behaviors we see in reality.
Because utility is **curved with respect to the goods (example: having twice as much of a thing does not make me twice as satisfied)** you cannot take the weighted average of the outcomes, as you have, and use it to predict behavior. 
What I'm saying is jensen's inequality bites you in the ass:
U(mean(x)) != mean(U(x))  Where say, "x" in this example is your proposed outcomes in dollar terms and mean(x) is the weighted average of those proposed outcomes by the weights we've chosen (assumed).
Kind of get it?
Or to put it in other terms, the disutility of the "way below 1%" case that your trezor is hacked or you punch in the wrong address during a transfer and you lose 100% of your bitcoins. Is *still* far larger than the incredibly minor *utility* gains of saving 2-3% on every transaction in the remaining 99.whatever% of the time.
Or another way, my disutility in losing 100% of my coins, is *more* than 100x the utility of gaining 1%. That's the nonlienearity of utility. And measurement has shown that especially at the low end, utility is *extremely* nonlinear. That is losing 100% of your coins is probably 1000 to 10000x times more than the utility of gaining 1% of your coins.
So the security in your system must exceed 99.999% reliability before there's any rational incentive to use it for such incredibly marginal gains. I strongly doubt that reliability exists in transferring bitcoin and storing private keys.

You present evidence in the form of deleted accounts by two people who are both *voluntarily unbanked* as evidence that bitcoin is helping the unbanked, and **I** am the one moving the goalposts?
You presented a pair of paper thin anecdotes as if  1) they actually support your position, they don't. and 2) as if it's indicative of some greater trend.

Yeah. No one could possibly solicit a bribe in bitcoin. Here's a qustion: have you ever paid a bribe to a government official? Have you travelled to any of these places and paid, "entrance fees," or paid on-site for a "ticket," or paid, "impound fees," or any of the other polite names for extortion?
