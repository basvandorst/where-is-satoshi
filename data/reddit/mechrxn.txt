They actually never responded to my inquiry. They simply sent an email saying all limits were raised to where they used to be.
@_date: 2016-06-20 07:31:28
And what about their threat of legal action against me?
@_date: 2016-06-20 05:49:32
Someone accessed my Circle Account. They then purchased BTC instantly from my debit card linked to my Circle Account and transferred them out. Why would Circle threaten me with legal action here? I did not authorize these purchases from Circle with my debit card. Should I call my bank and file chargeback charges here?

They didn't steal my stuff to gamble. They sent the BTC to non-gambling wallets. Circle shut me down while investigating this theft because I have utilized gambling sites before. Its quite clear I have to bite the bullet here regarding the stolen funds.

If you don't have anything constructive to add then don't post. You're probably one of those people that doesn't understand its possible to make money every month with solid bankroll management and analytics.

Wrong here actually. I store BTC on several platforms aside from Nitrogen and stake players for sportsbetting/poker/various other expenditures. I was unaware that this violates terms of service for Circle and Coinbase as I have been using them to fund players for many many months. The BTC that was purchased with my card was not sent to either of these accounts and was sent by whomever to an address I have never seen before. Yes, I am at fault for not being informed on the legality of BTC and gambling purposes. However, my Circle account was compromised with unauthorized purchases being sent to non-gambling related websites.

BTC were bought with the funds and subsequently shipped out of my account

I have circle as well. However I have used them for around 4-5 months and they have yet to increase my limits. Currently it sits at $300 a week which is tiny compared to what I need.

Not the case at all. I've been handicapping for a long time. It appears though, that more than two IPs accessed the account based on Circle's findings so they are looking into it further.
edit: grammar
@_date: 2016-06-20 07:07:34
No one I know would have access to my account/pc etc. 
@_date: 2016-06-27 23:10:02
Going on almost 7 days now. Their twitter support hasn't said anything in a week either
@_date: 2016-06-20 05:33:59
Please, I need advice on this situation. I used them a LOT but I did not authorize the most recent transactions from my account. As I said, they threatened legal action against me but I was not the one who authorized the transfers on my account. What should I do here?
@_date: 2016-06-20 07:14:30
FWIW I know that a lot of people use circle for gambling and I was not aware it was illegal. I was turned to Circle by these very bettors. My pc is 1 year old and is top of the line etc. no one has access to it but me. I have two factor authentication but I did NOT receive the texts and I am unable to access my email now. The password has been changed on me. They also threatened legal action only if I filed chargebacks against them. Is it worth biting the loss here? If I broke a law unknowingly then perhaps it is best to move on and deduct the loss. Regardless, the email clearly showd their mentality. Not sure if hiring a lawyer would be worth the cost.

Their twitter support hasnt said anything in 5-6 days. Awful
@_date: 2016-06-10 17:16:21
It has not. I haven't moved at all. They still haven't responded to me other than "We are investigating"
@_date: 2016-06-20 22:05:09
Up 127 units this year. Thanks for asking!

Update:  
Coinbase is "reviewing why this happened" and that is all they have told me. I emailed Circle to see if they would raise limits and they at least raised mine from $300 to $3000 for weekly buys so at least I have that. Probably will move away from coinbase now and stick to circle.
@_date: 2016-06-20 07:09:12
I informed Circle of this. I never received the text messages associated with my account for two factor authentication and it appears as my email linked to the account was also compromised. I cant access my email anymore as the password has been changed on it.
@_date: 2016-05-24 03:16:29
yeah talked to support, they are on it. should have funds in next day or two
@_date: 2016-05-24 03:16:13
