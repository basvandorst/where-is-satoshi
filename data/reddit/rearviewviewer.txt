The image eerily looks like a digital currency. I understand the concept of the article, bu the symbolism is pretty unique.

Yeah that’s why I changed my post to “kind of, sort of”. He has quite a few shitty stances on common sense subjects such as marijuana legalization.

Lots of abductions and murders. No one will be able to buy shit.

How can one government kill something that is decentralized, that it’s enemies can then use and foster for further access and control over the part of the world that it previously had power over. I think this is a get down or lay down scenario. The genie is out of the bag, it’s not going back in.

I didn’t know this guy before, but I like him now, kind of, sort of.

I know I should be nervous, but charts say I should hodl and relax. 2-5 years from now it will be much higher than today or not, either way who gives a fuck. Either you make some money because you had balls enough to take a risk or you go out and enjoy some fresh air and hit a blunt and start over.

Correct, this magazine was published 1988, the coin says 2018, strange coincidence indeed

There are plenty of banks that don’t have fees, switch to another. I don’t understand why this is an issue.

He didn’t defeat anything, the overwhelming might crushed them all.

As brave as he was unfortunately he did nothing. The communists hunted all of them down and killed them. They’re still killing all opposition, they even have concentration camps right now with millions in them.

Currency has and always has been what two parties agree upon amongst themselves as a store of value over time and space. As mass adoption occurs, so does stability. We moved from bones to stones to metal to paper to digital. All things evolve and move forward whether a few or many want it to or not. People may not want AI, it’s coming. They may not want genetic alterations, it’s coming. They may not want space exploration, it’s coming. They may not want the merger of man and machine, it’s coming. You may not want tomorrow, it’s coming.

From what I get, shorts got liquidated causing them to buy at market which created a short squeeze. Simply put a bunch of people were forced to buy at the same time creating scarcity and the increasing price reflected it, supply and demand.

Because he was using Bitcoins $58 price after a 40% drop to make his case, but years later we all see that he was indeed stupid, just like years later we’ll see that all naysayers are indeed stupid.

GBTC is a stock, even though it trades at a premium to its underlying asset, it still moves with the same momentum, sometimes better than its underlying asset. Also, it had great liquidity and managing taxes becomes easy if you own a stock. I personally like it a lot.

He could never make himself public if he even exists. People would hunt him down and rob him blind every chance they got because of the privacy of the matter and the ability to get away with it. We’re talking billions (perhaps trillions) at stake. The planet would become his prison.

Of course it would create inflation

It won’t have to be 3 years. We have not hit this seasons ATH yet, I really wouldn’t be shocked if we hit $50k which is 15 times the low. Previous runs have netted between 9-30 times the low. Just my thought, I’m no expert. Having said that, I agree that you have to have the nads to hodl for 3 years if need be with the confidence of a goat on a mountainside.
