Yeah this is the problem. People talk about sending 1mbtc when that's really just the transaction fee for a typical transaction! We've had [complaints]( about this on the electrum forum!
Bits is too confusing. We should only use the two original units bitcoin and satoshis. People will have to adapt to the decimal point. Bitcoin is not easy to get into and this is probably the smallest hurdle involved. If you can't handle this then the rest of it will be too complicated for you too.

I've been in bitcoin since 2013. This is my second bubble! 
Anyway I suggest you look at the bitcoin price charts from 2009 onwards. It's history is replete with bubbles and bear markets. bitcoincharts.com is a good site for this sort of thing. 
I especially recommend that you take a look at december 2013 and full year 2014 graphs. You will see that the price rose throughout 2013 and then the bubble burst before Christmas. After that it was a slow bleed down. We saw the exact same pattern this time. Price rose throughout 2017, bubble bursts at Christmas when traders cash out and then its a slow bleed down. Bitcoin markets are heavily manipulated so that's why we are seeing the same pattern repeat itself.

Miners are not the ones holding back segwit adoption. Segwit activated months ago with miner support. The uasf gauntlet saw to that.

You're right regarding the bear/bull cycle.

The derivation path you should use is given below (that includes the trailing apostrophe):
That's a zero btw. You also have to check bip39 under options on the seed entry screen. Make sure that you entered the correct seed. All letters in lower case and no extra spaces at the end or at the start i.e. only between words. It'll display a warning if the seed does not pass the checksum in it. However it lets you create the wallet anyway so pay attention to the warning and double check your seed. The seed words should be from this list:

The old recovery mnemonic is not a seed mnemonic. It is a password recovery phrase which is the wallet password in another form. You need both the UUID of your bc.i wallet and that recovery phrase to open your wallet. Please don't advise the OP to use bip32/39 tools because this is not a deterministic wallet we are talking about. This is the old bc.i wallet with unconnected random private keys.

There have been numerous bug fixes related to offline signing so it is definitely possible. You should use the latest version for your offline wallet too. [Here's]( a script that installs the latest version on an ubuntu 16.04 or debian stretch live CD. Run it using sudo.

What happens when you do this? Does the trezor restore a different wallet or does it reject it because the checksum is not valid like said?
FYI electrum 2.8.0 doesn't validate the checksum when you restore a bip39 wallet. Download it from electrum.org and install it. When you run it the first time it'll display the new wallet creation wizard. Select 'standard wallet'. Then 'i already have a seed'. In the next window enter your seed words. Click on the options button and select bip39. After you do that the "next" button will be clickable and you can proceed with the wallet creation. See if this restores your wallet. 
Note that the electrum devs [are working]( on implementing checksum validation so make sure you use the 2.8.0 version (which is currently the latest version). Later versions might not work for what we are trying to test (that older trezor versions didn't validate the checksum either).

The other exchanges said that they would list BU coins. Bitonic says it won't list BU until and unless it becomes the dominant chain and replaces core completely to become the new bitcoin.

In the event of a hard fork if you receive bitcoin then you need to wait for an extraordinary number of confirmations before you can consider the transaction settled. I would wait for 20 confirmations at least.

That algo has changed a bunch of times to support new seed versions but they ensure that there is code in there for older seed versions too. This is very important to the developer ThomasV. He calls it the electrum social contract i.e. the guarantee that you can always restore your wallet as long as you have the seed. So don't worry about it.
BTW there is one good reason to upgrade your cold wallet. If you use the RBF feature then I think you will have to upgrade. I don't think the older versions will be happy about signing RBF transactions.

We have transaction fees to stop people from spamming the network. *That* is what stops them not any arbitrary restriction on output addresses.
So yes you can send to the same address you are drawing the input coins from. You can also send to another address in your wallet. Wallets are not the same as addresses. Wallets have many addresses.
You can even send to addresses that have no known private keys. We call this burning coins.
Also with p2sh an address is actually a computer program that can do all sorts of cool things. Like an address that only allows the recipient to spend his coins in the future. Like a long term deposit.

At the moment the ledger only supports bitcoin. Various schemes have been devised to transfer other things on the bitcoin blockchain but nothing that has taken off yet. You can look into coloured coins and the latest and most promising which is sidechains. Sidechains is whats going to be used in the future. It's happening.
Alternatively some people just create their own ledger (blockchain) for other assets. These would be the altcoins that you may have heard of. The downside is that these are not anywhere as secure as the bitcoin blockchain.

they can game the difficulty adjustments. let difficulty fall by not mining it. when it does that they start mining it again. then as soon as it adjusts upwards they stop. rinse and repeat. 
because difficulty adjusts much faster than in bitcoin they can keep doing this. in the process they are creating much more bch than they should be. as a result the inflation rate over there is higher and block reward halving will come sooner. because tx fees are also lower there miners won't be able to make much money after the halving so they'll abandon that chain entirely.  bch is going to suffer a death spiral after that.

The main difference between this and totp is that they've automated the code entering part. The downside is that your phone has to be online to authenticate you because it has to communicate the code to google.
Technically it may be implemented differently. Instead of a shared secret they could be using public key encryption. Initially when you sync your phone with your google account your phone provides it public key and google stores that in its database. Later when you need to login google asks your phone to sign a random number with its private key and then google can verify that digital signature using the public key it stored earlier. This is how it knows that it's really your phone.
There is another app that does something similar and works for more than just one website:
But clef is single factor authentication.
I would say 1 and 3 are very secure. However I believe if you use authy for 1. then you are vulnerable to cellular network shenanigans. That's because authy lets you reset your account using just your phone number. OTOH the default google authenticator app doesn't let you do backups. So I think you will need to look into which apps let you both do backups on removable storage + are securely implementing totp. I think there is one by redhat that's good.

The reason is that all the payment methods you commonly use are reversible while bitcoin transactions are not. So selling you bitcoin is a huge risk because you could just reverse payment on them once you got your bitcoin and they would have no recourse. 
In addition to that governments are afraid of bitcoin and insist that companies dealing in it collect a lot of identifying info about their customers. It falls under know your customer or anti money laundering laws (KYC/AML).

If I remember correctly Grexit fears didn't have the impact people thought they would. Unlike the Chinese, European citizens have a lot of places where they can park their money so they don't seem as interested in bitcoin as a safe haven asset.

i'm not familiar with bitcoin core but isn't there an addresses tab that lists all your addresses?


Every address has a different private key.
Maybe you are talking about deterministic wallets? Deterministic wallets have a single seed from which all address specific private keys are derived. This makes backups easier because you just need to backup the seed once and that's enough for all future addresses. There is no limit to the number of addresses you can generate from a seed.


Yes but highly highly unlikely. The number of possible private keys is astronomical so the chances of generating a private key for an existing address are very low.

The reason is that it can be very profitable if your crypto currency succeeds to get users so lots of people just take the bitcoin code, swap the logo, change the name and release it as their own currency. Some make changes to the proof of work algorithms and then others come along and take *that* version, swap the logo and release their own currency and so on.
In some cases serious changes are made to the code and unique currencies are released that in many ways serve as testbeds for changes that might one day be included in bitcoin itself. 
Basically it's open source in action. Open source software is all about freedom to copy and modify code.
However despite all these altcoins bitcoin remains king because it has the most number of users and the most secure network.

they would not be generating the demand for transaction space on the blockchain. the txs would be generated by bitcoin users legitimate or otherwise. there is relentless demand for tx space on the chain. supply is currently artificially limited. i think what he's saying is that if we removed that artificially created scarcity tx space would become limitless. miners are certainly not going to restrict supply themselves because they don't have to bear the burden of carrying the chain and besides they get tx fees so why not include all the txs out there? it's the uncompensated full node operators that have to bear the burden of larger blocks.
of course a counter argument could be made that the larger the block the higher the chance it will be orphaned. so miners may not allow larger blocks because block subsidy is worth a hell of a lot more than tx fees.

Also I don't think the are actually going to go ahead with the 5k note demonetization. It's just a bunch of busy body senators who are pushing for it because they are jealous of India.

But this situation is not something we want. Sure, the market for bitcoin is fault tolerant. One exchange gets taken down and another takes its place. But do we really want this situation? Because each time an exchange gets taken down people lose money. I'd much rather have long running stable exchanges that don't get taken down by LEA and that don't lose money to hackers.

Maybe the transaction has already been submitted ? Look up your address on a blockexplorer to see how many coins are in there.
And FYI in future install a wallet your PC or mobile and use that. You can sweep your private keys using electrum or mycelium so you have no excuse for persisting with coinb.in.
@_date: 2017-01-19 07:55:53
they are being generated from thin air really. just like any other currency. the creator of bitcoin has no control over bitcoin. he left the project ages ago and besides it was always designed to be decentralized. the decentralization is the most important and unique aspect of bitcoin. It prevents censorship of bitcoin transactions.
who is paying for them is the more pertinent question. people who own bitcoin are paying for them through inflation.

Since it is impossible to tell whether a bitcoin address belongs to a Chinese person or a foreigner there is no way they can prevent individual Chinese citizens from sending money abroad. The only thing they can do is restrict withdrawals by the foreign clients of Chinese exchanges. If you are a non-Chinese using a Chinese exchange then now would be the time to reevaluate whether it is worth the risk using such an exchange.
It seems like terrible timing for BTCC in particular since they just launched an exchange catering to foreigners.

yeah this isn't a very practical option because of the need to exchange public keys beforehand and the fact that both parties have to be using electrum. I suppose in some cases you could pick up the public key from the blockchain if an address has been used before. but in most cases you are going to have to exchange public keys and if you are going to do that you might as well use gpg.

Just because you created an online marketplace that takes bitcoin doesn't mean that you are selling something that bitcoin users need. 
Let me give you an example. The industry that has adopted bitcoin the most is the web hosting/email hosting/IT infrastructure renting industry. Bitcoin is at number 3 after paypal and credit cards over there. In just a couple of years it has gotten more adoption than much older payment systems like skrill, payza and perfect money. Why is that? Because the target consumer of these services is tech savvy and he uses bitcoin. 
You must keep what happened with wordpress.com in mind. It was one of the first major sites to take bitcoin but they no longer do. Why? Because the sort of people that go to make free blogs at wordpress.com aren't very tech savvy. If they were they'd be running wordpress on their own hosting. So even though wordpress.com gave bitcoin a huge push bitcoin didn't actually work for them.

If you are asking this question then you are way too green. Bitcoin goes up and down all the time over basically nothing. A trump victory doesn't help or hurt bitcoin until and unless he actually makes a policy statement regarding bitcoin.
So forget about this little upward movement. It's meaningless. 
My suggestion is to buy a little and read a lot. Learn as much as you can about bitcoin especially the technical side of how it works. You need to understand why it is a great investment before you invest because otherwise you'll just panic sell the next time the price crashes (and make no mistake about it that *will* happen). 
And remember the best way to acquire bitcoin is a little at a time. You can't and shouldn't really go and invest a large amount all at once.

yeah cuba is a different case. they have more than one currency and they have a huge welfare state thing going on. 


your point about this stands though. bitcoin was never for developing countries simply because poor people are risk averse and will not put money in a currency that is so volatile as bitcoin and which they can't use on a day to day basis for meatspace transactions in their own country. Besides you need access to banks to buy and sell bitcoin in developing countries. As for the cost of transactions that's not such a big deal. Even banks charge this much in developing countries.

That's because your government, like most developing country governments, prevents people from sending money abroad so bitcoin is worth more in india than outside of it.
You could post a want to buy ad in a freelancer forum. Perhaps some freelancer will sell you his bitcoins. It's unlikely though because he'll just google the price and sell on the established exchanges instead of selling it cheaply to you.
IMO if you can't afford the risk of buying at current prices then you should wait this bull run out. The price will eventually go down. Make no mistake about it.

Russia has said that it'll start mining bitcoin at govt level. Russia says a lot of things about bitcoin so we'll have to wait and see how it pans out. 
Trading oil for bitcoin at the international level is not likely any time soon because you are suggesting is to set yourself up for invasion by the US. Also the reason they sell oil for USD is to be able to spend those dollars on buying other things from other countries. It would require a much broader shift away from USD for international trade.

That is irrelevant. All USD wires go through US banks. Even wires not involving US citizens. I keep having to explain this to people here. When US banks shut you down they shut you down for the whole world.
The thing with btc-e is that wires were always problematic with them. High fees,lots of KYC and poor support. So the users there didn't use that feature. They used other currencies like perfect money or local payment methods in CIS countries. You can still withdraw fiat using these other methods.

indeed seeking to one up the competition is good business. but it's a little more complicated than that:
- the mining centralization thing is a problem but i don't see how you can fix that. centralization seems inevitable. if not this patent then the next one.
- this particular optimization rewards miners who mine empty or small blocks. that is bad because it increases the transaction backlog. lots of empty blocks help no one.
- he setup this whole bu/classic drama to undermine support for segwit. it means he doesn't want changes made to bitcoin that hurt his competitive advantage. changes that can improve bitcoin. again we don't want this. we do want to improve bitcoin.

You do realize the last time we had this sort of situation the warning signs were apparent for months and people still lost money? The price on Gox was way higher than other exchanges for months. There was this huge ass thread on bitcointalk forums about Gox's various problems. Despite all this people still lost money to Gox because they didn't pay attention to these warning signs. The lesson we learned from that is that there are many bitcoin users who keep large amounts on exchanges and don't follow bitcoin news. Bitcoin markets are *not* efficient.

Actually for the purposes of buying and selling bitcoin we definitely need to know the user's geographical location. The reason is that different exchanges cover different countries and your options to trade bitcoin differ from country to country. It is very annoying when new users, especially on ask for help about how to buy bitcoin but don't specify their location. So please don't discourage them from revealing their location because we can't help them otherwise.

- It isn't using segwit. [View the transaction]( on blockchain.info and make sure you click show "scripts and coinbase" under the inputs and outputs part. Then it'll show you the transaction scripts and if those scripts have the word witness in them then it's a segwit tx otherwise it's not.
- It isn't using multisig which a lot of exchanges use. Bitstamp uses multisig too
My guess is this is just a regular user's wallet

For the most part that's true. But they do accumulate money over time. If they see that bitcoin's price is rising they might hold on to some. When they return home they start businesses with what they've saved up. 
It all depends on their exposure to bitcoin. If it's via a money transfer agent then they don't actually hold it and know nothing about it. But if they're actually going out and buying bitcoin and sending it to family members in south asia then they have the option to hold on to some. I guess that's still out of reach for blue collar workers because of the knowledge required to do all that. Perhaps white collar workers are doing it.

So that restoration from seed is possible. Electrum's seed mnemonics incorporate a seed version for that very reason - so that it can detect the wallet type automatically based on just the seed. Otherwise it would have no way of knowing which type of wallet to restore. Before you say "rely on the user" believe me when I say that most users don't know what their wallet type is!
There are many different types of wallets like standard single sig wallet, multisig wallet, 2fa wallet and now segwit single sig and perhaps multisig wallets. Each type is given a different "seed version" which is encoded in the mnemonic.

Why would electricity be cheaper in japan? Japan is a resource poor country. Canada is an oil rich one.
Fact is mining has no business being in energy deficient countries like China. The only reason its done there is because the hardware is made there and the entrepreneurs are Chinese. They are most comfortable operating in their own country.
But you can make the hardware somewhere and mine somewhere else. That's basic specialization. Mining should be done in oil rich countries. If the middle east was more welcoming they would move there. Alternatively there's norway, canada, russia and nigeria.

A new type of bitcoin address encoding that begins with bc1. addresses that look like the following: bc1qw508d6qejxtdg4y5r3zarvary0c5xw7kv8f3t4 . These addresses are for segwit script types. The advantage of using these address is that when you spend funds send to them your transactions are smaller than for p2sh (3) addresses so you save money in transaction fees and there is less space used on the blockchain (which has to be carried for all eternity by full nodes).

China is a major force in bitcoin so I for one don't want them to be shut out. All governments are struggling with the question of how to deal with cryptocurrencies. China is no exception. They don't want to ban it because it's a growth industry.

Bitcoin is the first decentralized digital currency. There are lots of decentralized physical currencies. Gold, precious stones etc. But there has never before been a decentralized digital currency. So what does that mean? It means a currency where no one can censor your transactions. No one can confiscate your funds. You don't need anyone's permission to use bitcoin. There are no gatekeepers. It's an open system with no one entity in control. And it's quick and easy to transfer money using it relative to other forms of decentralized currencies i.e. the commodity monies I mentioned earlier. Decentralization is bitcoin's unique property and it's what gives it value. 
Now does it make a good currency? The answer is for the most part no. But in some circumstances people find it useful as a currency too. Like when dealing in small value transactions across borders. 
Anyway the main point you should understand is that if people are buying it as a store of value then they eventually use it as a currency too. Conversion to and from fiat is a PITA so they use bitcoin directly. Whatever drew them into it in the first place also results in them using it as a currency. 
You should also understand that being an open system it grows in acceptance daily. It's called the internet of money for a reason. It may not be the best but day by day it's usefulness increases.

If you want a reason to criticize bitpay then criticize them for their network fee which makes paying with bitcoin more expensive than paying with other payment methods. 
There is nothing wrong with bip70 payments. It was created to reduce errors when paying merchants. The fact that wallets have buggy implementations isn't bitpay's fault. It's the fault of wallet developers. Bitpay pushing this is forcing those devs to fix their bugs and that's good for bitcoin.

So you will definitely be need help figuring out how to access your bitcoins. People telling you to go dark are forgetting that you don't have the coins yet. You will need to take it slow and do a lot of reading. Also keep all your discussions on public forums like this one, bitcointalk or  irc channel on freenode. People can correct each others mistakes on public forums and scammers have  a harder time operating out in the open. Whatever advise you get can be validated by multiple people. So lots of benefits to keeping it public. Just don't share any of your secrets (passwords, recovery keys) with anyone.
Starting with the recovery keys do they look like private keys or addresses?
Private keys:  - look at both WIF and mini private key
Address:

it's not practical as a currency. people think 10 times before using it to buy products because the value keeps going up and down. it'll probably never be practical as a currency because without a central bank to control it's value it'll always be volatile.

Yes buying bitcoin is very hard but it's worth it because you profit from owning bitcoin in the long term. No pain no gain.
The reason you are having so many problems is because you're not a local. Exchanges haven't yet figured out how to deal with expats. 


No it's the fact that bitcoin transactions cannot be canceled. So the buyer can cancel payment but he gets to keep the bitcoin and the seller, which is the exchange, loses money.


Post a buy ad, then. Buyers of bitcoin can also post ads.  Somebody has to take the first step. Why not you?


You can pay the seller via domestic bank transfer or mobile payments. Post an online buy ad on lbtc. Online = electronic payment method. There is no need to meetup with him.

There are other possibilities:
3\. Malware author wants plausible deniability for his actions because he knows coins can be tracked. The seed is going to become public anyway as soon as the first victim posts about it on a forum so might as well use a seed that's already public. He can't use a watch-only wallet because Electrum displays a warning dialog when you open a watch-only wallet and that's the sort of thing that'll alert potential victims.
4\. There was no malware infection at all. The OP himself recreated a wallet using this seed in order to steal coins. Then he forgot all about it. Later he sweeps his paper wallet to it. Since the seed is public lots of people are watching it and someone steals the coins. This sort of thing has happened before with private keys from various competitions. People import them into their wallets, time passes and they forget all about it. Then they send coins to the corresponding addresses and oops coins stolen!

yep but eventually it either gets too expensive and demand goes down or the alternative solutions come up and supply increases. either way price will not stay up for long.

probably the case. and for error correction purposes they repeat some data:

It can't currently happen because the network can't accomodate a larger number of transactions which a larger number of users would generate.
If we manage to implement a scaling solution then the brakes are off and we can get on with it. In that case
 a) price rises 
b) transaction fees rise until we build a second layer 
c) volatility will increase with the initial price rise but eventually a larger market cap will mean less volatility 
d) a power struggle ensuses. government interest in regulating bitcoin will increase. attacks against bitcoin by malicious actors will increase because, if successful, they will be more profitable 
e) larger and larger investments are made in mining. perhaps intel or amd will get in on the action.
f) other unpredictable changes are likely to happen. bitcoin is just one big drama really :)

Actually asking them to use paper wallets generated on offline computers is the really nerdy advice. I just tell them to install a software wallet on their PC or mobile and I believe that is well within their capabilities.

These places only exist because of your backward financial system. In most developed and developing countries bank transfers are instantaneous and cheap. Account numbers are not secret so you can share them with people who need to pay you. You don't have to wait for a cheque to clear.

Electrum has fixed bugs related to transaction fees and introduced new features like child pays for parent (CPFP) and replace by fee (RBF). Right now it is the best wallet as far as proper fees are concerned. However you have to be using the latest version to take advantage of all this. You were probably using an ancient version. We get a lot of complaints from users on the forum and all of them turn out to be using old versions or are setting fees manually (dynamic fees are the way to go). We tell them to upgrade and do CPFP to get their funds moving again.
However if your case you have a large transaction so it'll be costly regardless of the wallet you use. If you don't need to move this money right now I suggest waiting until a scaling solution has been put into place. That will reduce tx fees and you'll save money.

If you care about keeping your bitcoins then [don't craft a phrase yourself]( and don't go mucking about with individual private keys. Instead use a deterministic (HD) wallet like electrum. It will generate a truly random phrase of 12 words that you can write down or memorize. Furthermore those 12 words unlock a whole tree of keypairs and addresses and, with [electrum]( receiving and spending bitcoins sent to those addresses becomes very easy. You don't have to worry about change addresses. You don't have to worry about transaction fees. Electrum handles all that.
You can even do cold storage with electrum:
And multisig:
@_date: 2016-10-26 12:22:56
well it depends on the situation really. in this case RTFM is not warranted because it is clearly not the user's fault. you can't really expect them to think about space on the blockchain.
so what are you autistic?
@_date: 2016-10-31 20:12:00


another thing you can try is this command on the electrum console tab:
`ismine("&lt;address with the coins&gt;")`
If that address is in your electrum wallet then electrum will return true. 
this sort of thing is kinda why i suggest you ask in the armory forum because there is probably an equivalent command for armory that will clear up this whole confusion.

Sender can be spoofed quite trivially. To make sure the sender actually sent the message check whether the email passes dkim and spf checks. If you are using gmail it should add the relevant email headers telling you that. Use the "show original message" option to see email headers.

bitcoin tends to have price bubbles and price crashes. so whenever the price goes up people hope it will *really* go up. it doesn't seem likely this time because we know the reason for this price increase and it is because of the renminbi devaluation. when the PBOC signals that it is done with that the price should settle down fairly quickly.

No that's not what i'm saying at all. I'm saying he doesn't want any change made to the controlled supply of bitcoin i.e. it continues to be a deflationary currency.

First of all you must understand this hardcoded list is only used the first time Core runs during the bootstrap process. 
Second how many times do i have to explain to you that Core verifies the blocks itself? If the blocks violate the rules then Core will ban those peers that gave it those blocks. The worse thing that can happen is that you ban all your peers and have no one to give you blockchain data. When this happens no doubt the user will definitely notice something is up and look into it. He'll supply some peers manually and it'll be fixed.

you could always cash out to fiat. fiat withdrawals were not stopped. only btc withdrawals were stopped. now you can take btc out too. so no longer is there an incentive to sell your btc just to get money out. hence the price rise.

yes so you won't be able to bootstrap your full node. your client will be stuck at synching. as a user will you not notice that? will you not look into it? you could then supply core with your own list of nodes. then it can bootstrap properly and the matter is resolved.

I don't recommend making a large investment at this point in time. We are currently in a bubble and the price is super inflated. 
What you should do is a) read about bitcoin and learn all you can b) get yourself verified on an exchange b) buy small amounts or play with testnet bitcoins. Basically set yourself up to buy big when the bear market has set in which it will.

The problem is "coincidence of wants". You need someone who a) has btc b) wants to buy your car. It's a lot harder than finding someone who has a) fiat and b) wants to buy your car because a lot more people have fiat than btc. It's the shallow pool of potential buyers that's the problem.

Yes there are cycles where it bubbles up and when it goes down. Right now we seem to be at that stage where the bubble is starting to end. This doesn't mean the price will only go down because that's not how markets work. There will be downward movement, bull traps, sideways movement but overall the price will bleed downwards over the next many months.
So you can time the market but only over years not on a day to day basis.
If you are looking to buy now is not the time to do so. Wait for the long and depressing bear market.

Not true. Not true at all. SWIFT is about the most ridiculous payment methods there is. The sending bank may advertize a fixed fee but that's just *their* fee. Correspondent banks that route the money can deduct arbitrary amounts without getting prior consent from either the sender or the recipient. The recipient's bank may also take a cut. So the bottom line is that you never know how much the recipient will get until the money lands in his account.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:57:12
