Actually it is the merchants who get screwed on fraudulent transactions.  I had my business cc info stolen 4 different times over the course of six months.  One of the times when I called the bank and told them that I had basically figured out which merchant was the one ripping off my card number the bank could not have cared less.
The reason is that when a customer does a chargeback for a fraudulent transaction, the bank simply takes the money back from the merchant.

Regardless, there is absolutely zero chance that this guy is legit, see some of my other posts on this topic for more info if anyone is interested.

I guess you havent heard that the University he claimed he taught at has already come out and stated that he didnt have the PhD that he claimed.  Also the computer company that he claimed manufactured one of his $100 million dollar supercomputers says they have never heard of him.
So, the fact is that he lied about his qualifications, the only question is how many of them he lied about.

legit as in, didnt make up pretty much every pertinent fact about himself.
Just look at my post history, I only have a handful of posts on here

First off, why would those be the only two choices?
Second, the money Nakamoto Dundee stole wasnt spent on bitcoin.

Are you saying the university is falsely claiming they did not award him a PhD when they actually did?  Any evidence of this?


How do you know they are not?


Yep, he could have spent tens of millions of dollars buying used computer parts to build a supercomputer.  Except he claimed that he was working with the manufacturer, not purchasing spare supercomputer parts.


His website posted a letter on SGI letterhead, signed by an SGI employee, stating they were working together.  When contacted, SGI stated they never worked with him and thus the letter must be another forgery.

Yeah they sure had it out for him.  They didnt want to let him steal any more money from the Australian taxpayers!  What a bunch of jerks!

LOL.  I dont need to "have a copy" of his videos, or even understand them to know that the guy is a con man.  Also not sure what my knowledge of IT certs has to do with any of this.   Obviously Craig lied about his academic credentials, whether he actually had a few IT certs or not isnt really relevant.
Also, not sure why you think i am heavily invested in satoshi=szabo.  I have no idea who szabo is, and dont care whether or not he is satoshi.

Thats hilarious.  I recognized Nakamoto Dundee towards the end.
edit:  Found a link to the source video for that interview over on r/bitcoin
I noticed in the second part of the interview he has some made up story about how he "worked with a number of banking products" and claims that there is no existing bank software that works with  bitcoin so he had to develop bank software from scratch.  This interview  took place in July of last year.  During this same time period he was trying to get tax money from the Australian people to reimburse him for the money he claims he spent buying banking software from some guy off the street!
These interviews are overflowing with comedy gold.
Also he claims he "worked with

According to the recent article in the London Review of Books, Kleiman bought drugs on the Silk Road.  That's probably the only connection to bitcoin he probably had though.

Bitfinex would not have access to the US banking system in that case.

This guy is a con artist.   If you read the article in the London Review of Books by Andrew O'Hagan, there is a lot of inside information on how he is running his latest scam.
His "friend" Matthews who suddenly remembered that Craig Wright showed him early drafts of the bitcoin whitepaper is clearly in on the scam.  According to the article in the LRB, these guys have conned another guy, Robert MacGregor, out of at least $15 million dollars.
Apparently he has recently started filing a bunch of bogus patent applications on everything related to bitcoin in order to try to keep this satoshi scam going.
They suckered MacGregor out of his money by convincing him that these patents were worth a billion dollars and that they were going to sell them all to Google or Uber.

I think the problem is that the first "parody" video produced from this ad actually only had the small changes the earlier poster listed, but the "parody" was 99.999% identical.

I suggest looking at some of the work of Bill Black here.  He is a former bank regulator who sent many, many, many crooked bankers to prison for the S&amp;L crisis.
Also read some of Michael Hudson's work on this.

Everything I have stated has already been "fully revealed".  It is fully revealed that Craig Wright is a very good con man, but he definitely didnt invent bitcoin and he doesnt have a treasure trove of patents.

The David graeber book is great. He has also done work with Michael Hudson. Hudson has a lot of stuff online, but the books he has written through the ISCANEE group at Harvard are really good. They are expensive though, and not sure that many libraries have them.

The Inside Job is OK, the Big Short is OK also.  If you really want to understand the housing crisis though, the book Econned by Yves Smith is the best on the topic.  Also I recommend reading Bailout, by Neil Barofsky, who was the Special Inspector General of TARP.

MacGregor was not in on it, as he seems to be the one out all the money.  
I am not a computer expert, but I understand that there were many ways in which Wright could have faked the "proof".  Also he could have had a extra flash drive prepped ahead of time, and switched it with the one he was showing Gavin or Jon in the "proof".  There could have been a million different ways he tricked them.  We will probably never know exactly what he did, but obviously if he had real proof he would just post it instead of doing all these things under elaborate, staged conditions.
Also remember that at the time this was going on, Macgregor was unaware that Matthews and Wright were working together.  In the article, the author talks about how Wright acts crazy during the meetings, and walks out a few times, and Matthews is yelling at him in the hallways, etc.  This is all part of the scam, to get Gavin or John or the author to be distracted by the theatrics.  
Another interesting thing.  The author claims that when Gavin was shown the "proof" it was rejected.  Then, after a few minutes, Gavin realized that Wright had "forgot" to put his initials on the message.    This is just another example of Wright's deceptive, manipulative behavior, another psychological trick to manipulate Gavin.

That was a terrible article. The author got scammed by wright.
Stefan Matthews is another con artist and he has been working with wright for years. If you understand they are working together to scam, that article makes a lot more sense.  They were never going to sell anything to google, that was just a bogus story to steal money from MacGregor!
@_date: 2016-07-03 23:43:47
What he stood to gain is the money that Robert MacGregor paid to Wright to purchase the shell companies that owned "Satoshi's patents" and to pay off all Wright's debts.
Wright and Stefan Matthews partnered up to screw MacGregor out of that money.  The whole "selling patents to google" part was just a fairy tale made up by Matthews and Wright in order to convince MacGregor to pay them $15 million.

MacGregor is at home like [this](

Craig Wright is a con artist.
Let me tell you exactly what happened, and then go back and read that article.  (FYI there is no book, just the very long article)
Craig Wright partnered up with his crooked partner from years ago, Shane Matthews.  Shane "remembered" that CW had actually shown him the original white paper years ago.  Shane then convinces the mark, Robert MacGregor, that he might have a great investment opportunity for him.  He tells him that his old buddy from years ago is actually Satoshi Nakamoto, and wants to sell off all his patents.  
MacGregor is skeptical at first, but agrees to meet with him.  They meet, and MacGregor takes an instant dislike to CW.  However, Matthews and CW claim that these patents are worth $1 billion dollars, and they will split everything three ways!
Remember, MacGregor does not know that these two con men are working together.   He thinks that the only way Matthews can profit is if the whole story is real and they sell the patents for big money. Unfortunately for him though, there is no billion dollar hoard of patents.  This is a classic con called the [advance fee scam](
Once Matthews convinced MacGregor to "buy" all of CW's bogus shell companies and pay their debts, the scam was complete.  MacGregor paid $15 million to CW (and Matthews).  After that, the whole story, everything this author writes about, is just them covering up their tracks.

Gross injustice?  Craig Wright is a con artist.  He scammed the Australian taxpayers out of over a million dollars with a tax scam, and then scammed Robert MacGregor out of $15 million dollars with this latest "I am Satoshi" story.
@_date: 2016-07-04 02:50:02
No.  MacGregor never saw it, because it never happened.  Matthews just recently remembered that Wright showed it to him years ago.  He also just remembers that Wright tried to sell him some bitcoin years ago, before anyone in the world was actually buying and selling them.
@_date: 2016-07-03 23:37:15
Wright and his partner in crime Stefen Matthews teamed up to scam Robert MacGregor out of $15 million.  They convinced MacGregor they had a bunch of "Satoshi's patents" to sell and that they would split the money with him 3 ways if he just bought the companies, paid their debts, paid for a PR firm, put them all up in nice hotels for months, paid for all their drinks, etc.
They never planned to sell anything to anyone.  The scam was getting MacGregor to pay millions to Wright for the companies that owned "Satoshi's patents".   They sold him a pig in a poke.
@_date: 2016-07-03 23:18:08
I've read it.  Wright is a con man.  His business empire consisted of a bunch of companies making millions of dollars in transactions with each other as well as another thief named Mark Ferrier. 
He then used these bogus transactions to defraud the Australian taxpayers out of over a million dollars. His tax problems with the Australian government have nothing to do with bitcoin other than he claims some of these transactions were "off the blockchain" and he was transferring the rights to Satoshi's bitcoins.
As the Australian government was investigating him for tax fraud, he partnered up with Shane Matthews, who suddenly remembered that years ago Wright had shown him the original version of Satoshi's whitepaper!  Matthews then introduced Wrightto his latest mark, Robert MacGregor.
Matthews told MacGregor that Wright had convinced him that he was really Satoshi, and that MacGregor should contact all his investment banker buddies because they were going to sell Satoshi's patents for a billion dollars.  Matthews and Wright generously offered MacGregor one third of the money!
Of course, there was no billion dollars, the patents are vaporware, and Wright is definitely, with 100 percent certainly, not Satoshi.  His only involvment in bitcoin is that he bought a few coins near the peak on MtGox and then lost them all when it went broke.
@_date: 2016-07-03 23:21:42


No, this isnt true.  In fact, the article about the UK government threatening to arrest him was proven to be based on a bogus website posing as another news site.

You are half right.  Craig Wright is clearly a con man, but I disagree that he has failed miserably.  He and his partner Matthews scammed Robert MacGregor out of $15 million  bucks.  The "selling the patents to Google for a billion dollars" was just part of the con, it's a classic scam called the [pigeon drop](

Matthews was in on the scam, but neither MacGregor nor the author of that article seem to have realized this.  This is just a modern day version of the classic confidence game called the advance fee fraud.  The cons convince the mark to pay money in advance with the hope that a much larger sum of money will become available later.  The much larger sum, in this case the billion dollars Google was supposed to be paying, is as real as the "hidden swiss bank account" in the Nigerian prince scam.
MacGregor should have realized that if what Wright and Matthews were saying was true about him being Satoshi, it would make no sense for him to essentially "borrow" $15 million dollars from him and then sell the "Satoshi patents" to Google for $1 billion dollars and split the money three ways.
Why wouldnt Wright just actually borrow $15 million, pay it back out of the $1 billion, and still have $985 million left instead of splitting the $1 billion and only ending up with $333 million?  Even if we were to assume he had to pay 100% or even 1000% interest on the loan, he would still end up ahead by hundreds of millions of dollars.
It is interesting that Matthews references $30 million.  In another part of the article, MacGregor mentions that he spent $15 million.  I wonder if Matthews and Wright misled MacGregor into thinking that Matthews was also paying $15 million to Wright.
