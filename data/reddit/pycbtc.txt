We've posted a picture on our Twitter.
@_date: 2014-10-20 22:03:26
Yes, this is already in the works!
@_date: 2014-10-20 02:08:43
I'm sorry you feel we are lying, unfortunately you are mistaken.  We were attending a meetup group in the back of the restaurant from 2-7PM.  FLAT 128 was also open today as proved by the transaction logs on the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-10-31 22:55:12
It's working great!
@_date: 2014-11-01 18:39:04
You're awesome, thank you!
@_date: 2014-11-01 04:28:00
Let's set something up at your local bar
@_date: 2014-10-19 22:16:56
Hi LOLWayne,
I have been at the restaurant all day, it has been operational. Thanks for your consideration.
@_date: 2014-09-28 14:24:19
Currently the store owner has been preventing that.
@_date: 2014-10-19 16:13:44
That's our plan!
@_date: 2014-10-20 13:42:11
I apologize about that, we're pretty good at keeping them stocked with bitcoin but there has been a lot of demand in Manhattan. We will be receiving additional funding in roughly 10 days that will cure this issue entirely. 
Blockchain.info is a problem, they have a lot of issues and we are working to make stand alone system for our machines as well as accurate pricing on our website. 
 
I appreciate the constructive criticism. Kaizen!
@_date: 2014-10-19 23:24:14
Will be adding shortly
@_date: 2014-07-15 04:15:40
Thanks Project Skyhook!  
Our business, PYC, is the owner of that machine. We look forward to expanding throughout the country.  If you know of a business that would like media exposure and an increase in foot traffic please direct them to our website and application process:  
We look forward to helping you purchase Bitcoin at a convenient location near you!
@_date: 2014-10-20 00:27:41
Thanks, it's a Bitcoin ATM. Sounds like you're a little hungry. You should head over to the Cupcake ATM between 60th and 61st St.
@_date: 2014-09-28 11:34:07
Yes, this is our location at Christopher street :)
@_date: 2014-08-22 16:38:20
Let us know what you think :)
@_date: 2014-10-19 23:47:21
Thank you:) Crispín's has been accepting Bitcoin directly on their wallet but are in the middle of setting up an account with either Coinbase or Bitpay to process payments.
@_date: 2014-10-31 17:49:16
Will do!
@_date: 2014-10-31 20:46:20
I'm so sorry!
@_date: 2014-10-20 00:31:23
We offer one of the lowest prices for cash transactions in NYC.
@_date: 2014-09-28 11:05:16
Our machine only does cash to Bitcoin, not the other way around. We may implement that feature in the near future.
@_date: 2014-09-13 13:40:39
Hi Qroshan, I'm sorry you feel this way. We are the least expensive cash to Bitcoin service in the NYC area and have recieved a lot of positive feedback from our clients.
@_date: 2014-11-14 18:02:27
We're still in the process of improving the design. It's not anything revolutionary. Different spaces might need adapted designs.
@_date: 2014-09-28 11:33:08
All you need to use our machine is cash and your Bitcoin wallets QR code.
@_date: 2014-09-28 00:57:19
Thanks for visiting our BTM! We have a $1,000/day purchase limit per person. All you need is cash and your wallets QR code. If you would like more information please visit 
@_date: 2014-11-14 04:19:36
It doesn't require any of those.
@_date: 2014-10-31 16:55:07
Thank you, hope to see you there!
@_date: 2014-11-16 23:04:23
No worries! The limit is $1,000 a day/person.
@_date: 2014-11-14 04:18:45
Glad you enjoyed our machine!
@_date: 2014-10-31 20:38:14
Sorry, let me rephrase that. We're going to reimburse the ATM fee if they purchase something from the bar. The blockchain will be essential in doing this!
@_date: 2014-09-28 10:59:01
The machine is capped at $1,000 per transaction.
@_date: 2014-09-28 11:35:41
We are in compliance with current regulations.
@_date: 2014-11-01 15:10:41
The owner accepts payment directly.
@_date: 2014-09-28 11:50:40
15 Christopher St, please check our website for hours.

We released the first Bitcoin ATM in Manhattan at a British lifestyle store.
@_date: 2014-10-20 00:30:30
All you need to do is scan your QR-Code and insert cash to purchase bitcoin. It's never been simpler!
@_date: 2014-11-15 00:11:11
Here's a video about the process: 
The price markup is competitive to localbitcoin traders and fluctuates based on demand.
@_date: 2014-11-07 12:34:43
I can confirm. They were also at Flat 128 checking out our Bitcoin ATM and making some purchases.
@_date: 2014-09-28 21:30:55
FLAT128 at 15 Christopher St.  It also hosts our BTM!
@_date: 2015-05-24 13:04:07
Good on you for transitioning from the service industry to building something lasting.
@_date: 2014-09-28 03:43:31
No you don't. 
@_date: 2014-09-13 13:37:05
Hi jedunnigan, We are in full compliance with the law and are a registered MSB with FinCEN. Please feel to reach out to us in the future if you have any further questions.

This machine is a Skyhook, we have a Lamassu in Manhattan.
It only requires a bitcoin wallet and cash, nothing else! 
@_date: 2015-01-30 23:30:44
Yes I had $6k on there and my coins have effectively dissappeared.
@_date: 2015-01-21 22:59:14
"window for potential maintenance will run until Dec 22 at 00:01 GMT". Take your time, that's almost a full year.
@_date: 2015-01-31 00:05:21
Hmm, it seems to be working on and off now.  I appreciate you looking into this,
@_date: 2015-01-28 22:19:04
Obviously you don't know what you're talking about.  I do $270k/mo with my two machines in Manhattan.
@_date: 2015-01-29 02:21:11
And I am defending the previous commenter.  I have ATM's in very small cities that do  $20k+ a month.  His machines are in high traffic spots in California.  I'm honestly surprised he doesn't do more than $50k monthly.
@_date: 2015-01-29 09:24:49
A trading platform is quite different from an ATM business as it services customers on the Internet.
@_date: 2015-01-29 09:34:56
He is not damaging the adoption of Bitcoin. It's my prerogative to say you don't understand economics. 
Trading platforms are an anchor to Bitcoin because they are all isolated instances. They have not yet implemented a distributed shared order book to reduce volatility because  it would mean less profit. Humans are instinctive, volatility creates panic leading to insane profits for trading platforms. When the day comes where trading platforms put sustainable consumer oriented practices ahead of making money than you will see a higher adoption rate. 
The ATM model will never reduce the price point because it's not sustainable and provides different services than a trading platform.
@_date: 2015-01-31 00:04:33
Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2015-01-28 22:59:22
Competition is already in that area on LBC, people just prefer reliable always available Bitcoin to meeting up with a sketchy guy that might not be on your schedule. 
@_date: 2015-01-29 09:53:08
Moving past that snide remark, it was simply a comparison. $50k is very doable in any medium to large city in the US.
@_date: 2015-01-29 16:12:55
I'm not making $270k a month. I'm processing that much. There is a big difference between pass through revenue and profit.

@_date: 2019-04-02 21:09:52
In order for us to offer support, we really do need to recommend 1 wallet as all wallets are very different and most are way too complicated for our customers to use. 
**2** is not dumb, we've had many customers walk away because a mnemonic is too complicated for them to figure out in a gas station/bodega setting when they have other things to do and not a lot of time. Forcing 2 is really bad for adoption. If they don't want to backup their wallet let them loose their money. It's simple.
@_date: 2019-04-02 21:03:04
Do I now? So you're telling me that your 85 year old grandmother that can barely use her smart phone and forgets her grandsons name is going to have an easier time with a wallet that forces you to back up your mnemonic before use? Well I got news for you, your wrong and obviously I know my customers better then *you* do.
@_date: 2016-02-19 00:05:40
I always had great luck with CampBX.  You're probably right though.  I seem to always get fucked either way.
@_date: 2019-04-02 16:00:30
It checks out, I just tested it and it looks good. I personally use MyCelium but there is no way in hell my customers are going to be able to figure it out. This looks like a good solution.
@_date: 2016-02-19 00:00:39
It's been very hard for me.  For the first year I had trouble sleeping and would get inexplicably angry over the smallest things.  I had visions of going to Japan and doing bad things to get my money back, obviously this would never happen but it never stopped me from having these flashes.  As embarrassing as it sounds I lost 95% of my wealth, in the 6 figures.  I'm 23 now and was 21 then so I guess it was a lesson learned.  I have a very hard time trusting people now.
All of this pain just because I broke my phone with my wallet on it just before Mt.Gox went kaput.  I repaired the phone and transferred all my coins to Mt.Gox in hopes that I would never lose my coins to a lost/broken phone.  I had never used Mt.Gox previously, only CampBX but was a little sketched out by them at the time.  Oh the irony.
@_date: 2019-04-02 15:49:15
Thank you! I'm going to suggest our customers use your wallet. This will be the easiest for them.
@_date: 2015-03-15 22:34:49
I will definitely be doing this.
@_date: 2015-03-15 22:39:19
Exactly what I was hoping would happen.
@_date: 2015-03-15 22:40:20
That's a possibility :)
@_date: 2015-03-15 22:38:13
It's possible but we've never allowed selling of Bitcoin for cash, only purchasing it.
@_date: 2015-03-24 18:04:31
That's interesting. Many of the big banks have made credit card expiration dates to coincide with the October 2015 liability shift in an effort to get everyone on board with "new" EMV cards.
@_date: 2015-03-15 22:36:25
Thankfully I wasn't a BFL customer.
@_date: 2017-07-29 06:48:40

This address was generated in June of last year.
@_date: 2015-03-15 19:12:41
@_date: 2015-02-18 23:05:13
That's a great point and most likely the argument they will make. 
This still doesn't change the fact that I never recieved any letters or emails regarding this matter until they had already started administrative charges.
@_date: 2015-03-15 17:34:38
Not a clue, it was unsolicited.
@_date: 2015-02-19 00:20:04
You can use their brokerage service though.
@_date: 2015-02-18 22:44:55
I don't want to throw any names out there but they just launched a US based trading platform.
@_date: 2015-03-15 19:20:48
Thanks for looking into this, I should have provided more info, sorry about that. The same address was used for transparency not security.
If I don't find the owner I'll donate it to a local charity that accepts bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-18 18:06:55
To reiterate what was posted in the other thread. 
Thanks for posting this.
There seems to be a lot of false information being spread about this. Contrary to some of the comments on here I have yet to receive any of the letters that Vermont says they sent, this holds true today. I even sent them emails with my address and have yet to receive anything.
My argument is that the state statutes fail to distinguish "digital currency" as stored value. Due to the decentralized nature of Bitcoin I am not selling anything with the promise that it holds any specific value. As many of you know the price of Bitcoin at any given time varies amoung the third parties that distribute them on trading platforms and brokering services. In essense this is no different than gold, silver, or art.
One could argue many things have stored value. From property to tide detergent, which even fueled a TED talk about the black market "currency".
Feel free to reach out, could use the support!
@_date: 2015-02-18 21:41:52
Except the blockchain isn't an electronic record of value it's a record of ownership. 
Monetary value needs to be consistent for it to be considered stored value. As my original argument pointed out, at any given point of time the price of Bitcoin differs amoung the third parties that distribute it.
@_date: 2015-02-18 19:55:50
That's a great question, perhaps call Vermont's Department of Financial Regulation and ask them if it's okay.

They emailed those to me in lieu of them realizing that I never received any letters.  As stated by the DFR they need to send those certified mail in order to make it official.  I have since then provided my address and still have not received anything. 
I truly appreciate you looking into this. 
@_date: 2015-02-19 01:27:49
It's not about the $1,500 because I'd gladly pay it. It's that they want me to pay the administrative fines as well, in excess of $85k.
@_date: 2015-02-19 02:51:40
Yes we do, thank you!
