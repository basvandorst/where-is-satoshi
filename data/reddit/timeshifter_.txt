How often does the first prove to be the *best*? Bitcoin has basically been ruined by ASIC's. In that light, Scrypt was designed to be ASIC-resistant, so that the average person *will always be able to partake.* Do you have *any* idea how big of an advantage that is? I have a 4 year old NVIDIA GPU. It is absolutely *worthless* for mining BTC, because ASIC's exist. But Doge? My measly 100kh/s has mined me several thousand doge in fairly little time.
Sorry, but saying Bitcoin is the "apex cryptocurrency" is an incredibly naive statement, and really goes to show why Doge has gained such a following in such short order, and even grown to be competitive with BTC in a couple months. You guys simply need to pull your heads out of your asses and realize that first does not mean best. In fact, very *rarely* does it. BTC introduced a great concept, nobody will deny. But it didn't do it *right*. And it's become way too snobby about it to ever encourage active newcomers.
Is Doge done "right"? I don't know. But it's being done a hell of a lot better than BTC. The ease of mining, the community love, the public activity wherever it can happen... BTC simply can't compete with that. Value be damned; value is dictated by usage. BTC miners are hoarding, Doge miners are tipping. I don't know if Doge is the future, but I'm pretty damn sure that BTC isn't.
