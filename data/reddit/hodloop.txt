Will crypto credit cards be part of the package as well?

I expect them to ride it out like most of us. 400k after making 16m the year before is not that bad. Unless they went bananas with their spending. I also bet many are managing much of their own money as well, and then it makes sense to jeep managing that of others as well!

Line to their own property probably. This stuff used to be in the news all the time in the Netherlands relating to powering the heat lamps of weed plantations.

It might even be fully rational for a very large holder as this gets lots of clever people to spend a lot of time thinking about and understanding the tech behind Bitcoin, not to mention possible news coverage, which is good for the ecosystem and for the market...

GF’s out at a lesbian bar, BTC crashing WHY AM I HOLDING? I’LL TELL YOU WHY. It’s because I’m a bad trader and I KNOW I’M A BAD TRADER. Yeah you good traders can spot the highs and the lows pit pat piffy wing wong wang just like that and make a millino bucks sure no problem bro. Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO IT’S GOING DOWN I’M GONNA SELL he he he and then they’re like OH GOD MY ASSHOLE when the SMART traders who KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY’RE DOING buy back in but you know what? I’m not part of that group. When the traders buy back in I’m already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU’RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~! Those taunt threads saying “OHH YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD” YEAH NO SHIT. NO SHIT I SHOULD HAVE SOLD. I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU. You only sell in a bear market if you are a good day trader or an illusioned noob. The people inbetween hold. In a zero-sum game such as this, traders can only take your money if you sell.
so i’ve had some whiskey
actually on the bottle it’s spelled whisky
sue me
(but only if it’s payable in BTC)

Companies may produce income, but companies are very fragile and can go under. IMHO investing in Bitcoin is less risky than in stocks. Only index funds are more secure.
Houses can be destroyed by war or natural disasters or simply by neighbourhoods or towns going down the drain. Crypto is more secure and at worst on par with real estate.

Wow. McCafee is being an asset to the crypto world. The real massive news if true!

It is the killer app of crypto after all.

Don't tell them anything. A bit of drugs isn't the worst thing as long as you stay away from the physically addictive stuff. They don't need to know you spend it on crypto. Keep doing what you are doing but don't neglect school. Do go to uni, not for the learning but for the people you'll meet there. Tell them when you are 18. Don't worry almost everyone has secrets and that's fine.

Read the Millionaire Next Door. Keep it in Crypto or diversify into productive assets such as stocks, real estate for rental or to live in (if modest). If you want this to be the road to financial independence then don't buy that fancy car until you have 10m+

Dream market is one. Other dark net markets too. You can find them on deepdotweb. Could also just list it on Craigslist with Bitcoin info.

It does make me confident. There will always be buyers.

It does not. It encrypts a private key. Which, following BIP 44 you can derive into as many derived keys as you want.

I hope you mean balls of steel rather than steal :p

Have you invested a substantial amount in Bitcoin, or would you now?
E. G. Do you have a stake in this?
