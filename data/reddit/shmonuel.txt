That's Bitcoin (BTC) taking a detour away from being Bitcoin when captured by Core, Blockstream et al

BTC: 'I could have been a contender'
@_date: 2018-05-02 16:26:32
It was stupid - cause dismissive, one sided, uncritical, unqualified, knee jerk support for the BTC fork.     
Just like you find on this forum, groomed by u/theymos and henchmen with blockstream support.  
Tide's incoming, can't hold the floodgates forever

Keep the door closed ladies, or reality will come roaring in
@_date: 2018-05-03 02:35:08
No... take a look here
@_date: 2018-03-03 23:24:39
Actually we do, best you DYOR, look at
A) transaction fees on bitfinex, much higher for BTC. Just transacted there yesterday
B) look at BTC transactions

"pretty heavy allegation..." LoL sounds like I'm about to get sued by a confused cryptoanarchist
@_date: 2018-03-04 00:02:56
Childish tantrums..., you know parties don't have to explicitly say why they did something, they say what is convenient, it's up to you to figure things out
@_date: 2018-03-16 01:15:01
let's see    
* cheap fees, reliable confirmation times, zero conf transactions, spend &amp; replace users with BitPay/BCH or   
* unreliable fees &amp; confirmation times, no zero conf transaction because of RBF, Hodl users with whatever  you're calling it &amp; BTC
@_date: 2018-03-03 01:38:50
decrease is mostly due to drop in transaction volume, not segwit, not transaction batching

Here's some real competition for you btcpay -

Is this an attempt to get more donations?
@_date: 2018-03-05 06:32:36
Thanks for the facts, missing from the article, if you can call it that
@_date: 2018-02-28 02:01:02
From my perspective BTC has been successfully attacked by blockstream and core - see last rows,  attacks to slow down...
Preventing necessary upgrades, manipulating community, commit rights takeover

Bullshit article, no stats, just hearsay
Suspiciously aligned to what hearabouts want to hear..
@_date: 2018-03-03 23:11:54
They're liars trying to sell a product...
Don't take what people say at face value..  DYOR

Some people too stupid to understand irony. Look at what it's saying and who's bragging about the fail

You are right. Thanks

Has little to do with segwit, look at the facts, for last couple of months:
Bitcoin transaction volume cut in half:
Segwit adoption steady  
@_date: 2018-02-27 12:36:02
If you say so confidence man..
For the dimwitted please think of irony

Dumb money speaking...  
@_date: 2018-03-11 01:26:59
It's a lost cause, with BTC transaction fees, merchants are just going to use the cheaper solution.  Fix the disease - small blocks, not the symptoms - merchant/user flight to Bitpay platform...
@_date: 2018-07-11 16:35:01
Garbage price post

Translated - Idiots agree with idiots
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:20:23
Ver is right. Bitcoin was captured by Blockstream, reinstated with BCH. Market is agreeing with this, flippening in progress
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:28:29
Nah to LN, just support regular Bitcoin - BCH. More reliable, a lot less work, risk

Do you think lawsuit is ridiculous given permissionless software? If not why no lawsuit already?
