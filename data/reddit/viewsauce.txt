Joe Rogan retweeted it did he not? 
Andreas A needs to go on the Rogan Podcast ASAP and school him on beginners Bitcoin. 
Rogan is a smart guy and usually ahead of the curve when it comes adopting new tech.  He was rampant in social networks and blogging before it was cool, and has quite a popular podcast too, top 50 iirc.
Although he has admitted on his podcast he does not yet understand it, I think after a little exposure Rogan will surely 'get' bitcoin.  
Once he does 'get' it, I will be glad to be buying fitness equipment and supplements from his online store onnit.com.
@_date: 2014-05-22 00:42:36
This is huge.
@_date: 2014-01-16 03:53:39
I know this would be too much for me. 
Andreas is my favourite Bitcoin speaker and Rogan is my favourite mma personality and podcaster, I would literally freak!

I met the Coin Kite guys at the conference today and came away very impressed with them.  They say they have got a lot coming up. 
They mentioned about a new advisory figure coming in but didn't mention any names. 
They also have Blackcoin integration coming up in June which will be interesting to see a staked coin getting merchant adoption.

100% I've listened to him for years, I'm going to sign up with change tip with the sole intention of showing Mr Rogan some gratitude.

Hey thanks for the tip ;)
@_date: 2014-01-16 12:55:21
I'm sorry guy it's just a Roganism that has been lost on you. No offence meant, let's be friends.
@_date: 2014-01-15 20:19:26
Sorry I meant to write smart and successful. He's well respected by peers in all the different communities he is involved.
If Rogan liquidated in to bitcoin right now he would make you blush.
I'm guessing you are either an mma hater or a someone who has only come across Rogan from Fear Factor.
@_date: 2014-12-07 19:02:31
Lol are you new here?

David Seaman on twitter seems to rep them a lot I'm not sure if he is attached to them in anyway. Pretty sure he has done podcasts with these guys in the past... maybe he knows some real names to help you get your money back.

No offence lolz!

My vote is you go make it rain in r/girlsgonebitcoin
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:09:16
is having a backup to bitcoin not valuable? 
like 2-3% of the value?
Merchants are not being forced to take LTC over BTC much the same as merchants are not being forced to take BTC over Fiat, merchants simply will take it in the future as it offers more choice for the consumer.
@_date: 2013-12-09 06:39:00
With the amount of scams, thefts and site take downs in the marketplace  im sure there must be some users who wish for double their money over that period!

You wouldn't be the first to dump your iPhone as soon as you have got into bitcoin! Have you seen the boycott threads on here.
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:01:13
haha oh god no "Weed bought in Amsterdam with anonymous deep web currency" 
I can see the headlines already!!! 
Maybe the blockchain isnt the best place for these types of transaction.

Seriously fuck Apple, I changed my upgrade order from a iphone 5s to a Galaxy Note 3 after the coinbase shit last month.
As a parting shot I'm throwing my old 4s in the bin today.
I could never understand Apple haters until last month, now I see clearly.
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:35:33
I guess he doesn't know about e cash or other digital currencies before bitcoin. 
I also guess that he doesn't know much about bitcoin and is just throwing out a soundbite.

This has big implications for the litecoin market okcoin lead the price to 50 now that could all be fake????

People is very defensive of coins in subreddits, don't mention or advertise other coins or you get down voted.

Hey can we not have a site with market caps without the scam coins.
Just btc plz ;)
@_date: 2013-12-16 09:18:08
And I guess there is going to be a lot less people into to crypto so there will be less users also?
