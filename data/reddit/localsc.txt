My advice:
If it's Apache, then implement mod-evasive + mod-security. With mod-evasive, block more than 3 page refreshes a second, or 60 site accesses a second, for 20 seconds in block state. With mod-security, don't turn it on completely because it's likely to block normal functionality. Mod-security has a lot of false positives. So, instead, block anything connecting without a user agent. 
Then, look for patterns in the logs for things that just aren't usually possible except by DDOS, such as the same IP hitting the Terms or Privacy Policy more than 10 times an hour, etc. Start blocking IPs one by one like that. Then, as you see where you're building ranges of IPs, block them by CIDR range instead of individuals.
Next, engage TCP/SYN/ACK 3-part handshake authentication on the firewall. Also, determine countries where you absolutely do not do business, and block those.
You'll eventually see in 'top' that the RAM utilization is going down -- that means you're conquering it. It can feel a lot like wack-a-mole, but eventually you'll get it.

People have told me online in other forums that you're better off doing the 14% capital gains tax in the USA. It's not worth the risk of violating the Patriot Act with an anon debit card (a felony), and not worth all the heavy fees with these cards. After a lot of use, you'd get hit with more charges than the 14% capital gains. Or am I wrong?
Meanwhile, they say the best service is xmlgold.eu. I emailed them, and they do ship to the USA. Now, whether or not it passes US Customs is another thing.
