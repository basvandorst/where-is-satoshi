At the gym yesterday and the one guy I talked to about investing comes right up to me in the middle of the work out and says "you see bitcoin? It crashed!"
Pleaseeee you call this a crash? This is the whind up to the summer pitch!  People are so ignorant. Do you think it was just going to be a straight shot to 50k?

There's success stories which are nice to hear but then there's the real stories going to come out how crypto changed our lives. Helped become debt free,allowed to put down a good payment on a house, opened the door to starting our own businesses. These are the stories that really make me feel I'm doing the right thing by buying. I won't be a bitcoin millionaire but I will have a good amount of money for me And my family to reach the next step. 
Happy for you OP

downloading right now and going to watch it when I get home. I watched Zeitgeist 2: Addendum. That is the extent of my understanding. I will watch this vid to learn more.
-Thanks Guy
