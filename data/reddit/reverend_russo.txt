Or just don't talk about crypto to people who are weak willed.

It's like when across the universe came out and people attributed those songs to the movie instead of The Beetles. It was a little heart breaking.

That's kind of a bit far. I'd say a quick "thanks but I think it'll go back up soon so I'll just wait out these lows" 
No need to cause your father grief.

Thanks for the reply!
My main question is what sort of bottleneck is preventing people everyday Joe's from being able to use 64MB block sizes? Is it because that requires a lot of bandwidth to download the entire block chain and new blocks being added? Is it plain storage limitations (64MB*1000000 is a lot)? Or processing of all of the transactions that would be associated with larger blocks?
If you have any links I can read about these things, specifically how blocks sizes effect a coin as a whole I'd be stoked to read up on it. I've looked for resources but couldn't find much what I was looking for.

Genuine questions cause I'm still confused by all the bs going on with both sides. 
What are difference in running a node with a small black size vs a big one? Isn't the difference only 1mb vs 2mb at the moment? If that's the only difference then how many more resources does your node need to support that?
With off chain scaling, wouldn't that kind of take away for the decentralization of bitcoin? Is it just separate nodes Specific for recording transactions?Again this a new idea to me so hopefully I don't crucified

You're a piece of shit if that's the way you think.

Fuck you dude. Wanting people to lose their money to prove a point. Seriously fuck you.

It's like the opposite of pump and dump. Take a dump on something and then pump your coffers full of it :) oh rich people... what will they think of next!

The market cap for crypto has increased by $100bil in five months. Or doubled in five months, however you'd like to look at it. Market cap for bitcoin has more than doubled in that time. 
That's insane.

I've only read the first 10 or so pages of your first link but that's was a great read so far but it seems like a dynamic block size would be best for everyone, especially with the recent congestion on the network.
I could see how it'd could make a lot of existing nodes unable to operate or force them to upgrade resources, but isn't a block size increase inevitable the more that BTC becomes adopted? It's not like less people will be making transactions. And it's not like as technology progresses those requirements (from 2015) would be easier for anyone to have. It's rare to see a computer with less than a 1TB HDD and less than 8gb of ram. I think most people involved in bitcoin would have the specs required for a 4mb block size.

That would be some kind of returns if true! 
Remarkable
