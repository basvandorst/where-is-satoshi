One interesting thing if you look @ the total volume charts on quandl (or other bitcoin analytics sites) you'll notice that the daily volume is in a rough range of 2-3m BTC since early 2016.
I would EXPECT if BTC were actually being used heavily for goods/services, and exchange volume was only 5-10% of transaction volume, that therefore transaction volume would tend to go down as USD value increased, for obvious reasons. That is, prices are rarely pegged to BTC in the goods/services market, even if BTC is accepted as payment, and one would assume the cost of illicit BTC-only marketplace items haven't gone up 10x in a year, since you can still buy their equivalents in non-BTC markets at essentially the same prices as a year ago. 
I can't really think of a good reason for why total transaction volume has remained relatively stable as market value drastically increased.

Here's a quick chart I put together of exchange as % of total volume.. data before 1/25/17 was questionable due to a massive downward discontinuity in transaction volume around that time. It's mostly in the 5-10% range. Surprisingly a lot lower than I expected. Of course I have no idea the quality of the exchange data, since it's self reported by the exchanges, not a network extract.

Looks like this can be estimated by using these two timeseries:
Transaction Volume:
Trading (exchange) volume:
