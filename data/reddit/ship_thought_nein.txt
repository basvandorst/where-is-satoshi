Nice job! And you made about $2.35 for your efforts! Isn't bitcoin awesome? ;)
How long did it take you?
@_date: 2014-12-26 02:45:54
How many of those actually accept bitcoin though? AFAIK when you make a purchase with most companies it's the same as selling your bitcoins and then buying with actual money?

There are numerous attack vectors that don't involve brute-force wrt bitcoin security. The notion that bitcons are 'secure' is [laughable](
@_date: 2014-12-15 03:25:54
Wow! That's almost $5 an hour for your work!
@_date: 2015-01-16 06:34:47
Do you ever wonder why people think bitcoin is a cult?
@_date: 2015-01-13 06:09:35
Why should everyone else hold just so you can lose less money?
@_date: 2015-01-13 08:33:19
Just how gullible do you think this community is?
@_date: 2015-01-13 04:35:51


Wow! Just like dogecoin!
@_date: 2015-01-14 07:44:17
There has been a pretty substantial uptick in the lols though!
@_date: 2015-01-14 10:29:44
Meh. I get paid a shitload to laugh at you fools losing money anyway. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 06:34:18
Someone realised that bitcoin, while academically interesting, isn't really suitable for the vast majority of people and the current ecosystem is comprised mostly of scammers and conmen. Thus, they decided to cash out while the can still find an eager bagholder.
Feel free to blame 'trolls' or 'weak hands' if you must though.
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:10:21


Nope. The vast majority of companies which 'accept bitcoin'  use an intermediary. 
No one wants bitcoin. You've been lied to and taken advantage of. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:45:16
Pay me more than my employer and I'll shill for you.
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:01:09
You idiots have been saying that for almost five years now.
By all means continue doing what you've been doing, it's really really funny.
@_date: 2015-01-13 09:22:17
That thing you paid us to do for you? We've decided to stop doing it. No, you can't have your money back.
@_date: 2015-01-13 04:31:05
Was it your intention to lose money this quickly?
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:00:58
All of those computers are literally designed to do one incredibly specific thing, They're all useless for anything else.
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:03:43
Actually has always been hilarious. Now there's added schadenfreude though.
@_date: 2015-01-13 13:01:57


Incredibly, this isn't even the dumbest thing I've seen posted here today.
@_date: 2015-01-13 13:18:54
Except gold is actually useful in a way nothing else is.
@_date: 2015-01-14 09:11:33
Bitcoin is a scam and acts like a ponzi even though it isn't specifically designed like one.
Unfortunately you've been lied to and taken advantage of. Sorry for your loss.
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:09:01


@_date: 2015-01-14 13:56:36


See this is why bitcoin is funny to the outside world. There is no reason anyone has to buy any, ever.
@_date: 2014-12-26 06:27:27
Source? Everything I've read says it's &lt; 10%.
@_date: 2015-01-15 14:37:57
Every sell brings bitcoin one step closer to the eternal circlejerk, where it's just an ever-shrinking group of diehard true-believers selling between each other.
@_date: 2015-01-13 09:22:47


You're right. Venture capitalists are never wrong.
