Well you learned the wrong lesson then. Here is the full quote, emphasis mine: 
"Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. **Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%**."
Which is exactly what the optimization of the secp256k1 implementation was. A small critical part used by Bitcoin that resulted in a 5-7 fold performance increase. 
Edit: source of the quote:

There are hundreds of developers contributing to Bitcoin. Blockstream employs only a handful of them. 
Regardless if they are acting in Blockstream's interests, whatever they propose has to get through review by all that wish to contribute to Bitcoin, although some opinions weigh more than others (Bitcoin is a meritocracy after all).
So yes. FUD.

Wrong on both counts. Blockchain capacity will be increased. SegWit will add significant space and a hard fork to increase the block size is is being worked out as well. 
Secondly, LN is a P2P network, just like Bitcoin. You can set up channels with whomever you like. You're not being forced to use anyone's services. Additionally, there's no lock-in. All transactions are regular bitcoin transactions, you can close channels whenever you want, get your money out and connect to someone else, or just do regular bitcoin transactions again.

TCP/IP is definitely not a one size fits all. There's no way you can do stable voip or video conferencing over TCP. That's why they developed specific protocols that don't use TCP. Same goes for many game networks. Most of them use UDP because TCP is too slow for the communication pattern used in games. In fact, there are projects underway to write a UDP layer for Bitcoin because TCP is really bad at transferring small amounts of data (it works best with big data blocks).

Block size is a really bad indicator of actual network use. 
[Number of transactions per day]( says that we're hovering around 240.000 transactions, but if you [filter out long chains]( that number drops to 90,000 - less than half. 
@_date: 2016-04-28 18:21:02
Not all transactions are equal, in the same way that not all emails are equal (SPAM), or all network traffic on the internet is equal (DDoS attacks). So again, saying that the aggregate of all mined transactions is somehow a good indicator of actual network use is wrong.

From the link you provided:


It makes it considerably slower to verify and more importantly, it moves signature verification back on the critical path, meaning it can't be cached (for whatever reason, I'm not an expert on crypto). So any gains you make on transaction size is negated quite considerably by the time it takes to verify. Remember, it's not storage that's the issue. It's transmission + verification time of the chain tip.

Users don’t transact on liquid directly. It’s meant to quickly move funds between exchanges(by exchanges at request of their users). It supports bitcoin natively and other currencies like fiat through tokens. 
Making it easier to move funds between exchanges should help with arbitrage, lowering the price differences between exchanges and increasing liquidity (hence the name).

Another thing people don't seem to understand is that Bitcoin and related technologies are bleeding edge. It takes time and a lot of effort to move that edge forward. Everything is new.

Gdax and bitfinex will probably have a lot more bitcoin on the sidechain. Those funds are held in transactions that can only be unlocked by a majority of the federation releasing them. That’s the peg. The sidechain “bitcoins” are created / destroyed when a federation member “deposits” / “withdraws” from the sidechain. 
The sidechain behaves different from the bitcoin chain proper. Since it’s federated, there is no chance of a fork and block times are different too. 
 Bitcoins held by the federation need multiple members to agree to release funds, so hacking a single exchange doesn’t give you access to those coins.

When connecting to the Lightning network, you and a node of your choosing fund a channel. That basically means, you and someone else each put an amount of btc into a transaction that can only be spent if you and the other party sign the transaction. From there on, you generate (but don't broadcast) spending transactions that pays a part of the locked up btc to you and the rest to the other party. 
You don't have to connect to the merchant directly. As long as you connect to a node that has a route to the merchant, you're good.

Like you said, you want to invest $50 and like you said, it would have no impact on your life if you lost it. You could see if there's a bitcoin ATM somewhere in your neighbourhood and buy some there, or you could look on localbitcoins.com to see if you can meet someone in a public space to buy some (like a police station, if they allow it) or if you know someone around you that's into bitcoin, see if they'll sell you $50 worth. 
Even if the price crashes, it's just $50, and if you're going to sit on it for 10 years, this potential crash is going to have no impact what so ever. Better yet, should it crash, you can put in another $50 and get some cheap coins. :)

Actually, back in the days when Bitcoin shot up from a couple hundred dollars to over a thousand, BitPay saw an equal increase in transactions processed. Nowadays they're not that much involved in the community anymore (mainly because they were hacked and lost 5000 bitcoin), so we don't know how it's going these days.
So the opposite was true back then, I have no reason to believe that's not the case right now. People spend new found wealth.

It doesn't really require that much bitcoin to cause a cascade to happen. You have a stop loss at $8000? Other people have one higher than you, say, a bunch at $8500, some more at $9000, $9500, $9750, $10000, etc. If an attacker manages to trigger enough of them, they will cascade down until the order book can absorb them. So realistically, it would only require the attacker to trigger the first few stop losses and they will take over from there.
If he then sets up buy orders down to the range he thinks it will crash, then he'll get cheaper coins. The price will rebound back up a bit, and he's made a profit.

There is work being done in that area as well, called UTXO commitments. Basically you would be able to ignore the initial block download (but keep the tiny headers download) and fetch the UTXO only and then have a proof in the blockchain that the UTXO is sane. That would reduce your download drastically. A lot more research is needed in this area though.

It's one way to scale. It's mostly meant for small transactions. Other scaling efforts are aggregate signatures (formerly known as SCHNORR), which make transactions smaller and another is MAST (Merklized syntax trees) which also make transactions smaller. There's more efforts underway though.


Strictly speaking impossible to know, but Lightning isn't a hub and spoke model, it's a mesh model. Every node can connect to multiple other nodes and route payments. No need for hubs.


No hubs. :) Also, transactions are onion routed. Nodes only know about the node that sent them the transaction and the node they send it to. They don't know if the node they got it from is the originator and they don't know if the node they sent it to is the recipient or just another node in the route.


The practical limit is the number of on-chain transactions that can be made to open and close a channel. This is also being worked on to group open / close transactions into bigger "group" transactions, which has additional advantages (virtual channels, better privacy, etc). You can read about that [here](

The function of a hash function is to generate a deterministic random number, meaning, it will always generate the same number based on its input. What it is used for varies wildly within Bitcoin, as it's used in several places. 
For one, the hash of the block header is used for proof of work. The Bitcoin network requires a hash value less than a certain number in order to consider a block valid. This is very easy to verify. Simply hash the header and compare to the difficulty threshold. If it's less, then yay, a valid block. If it's more, then boo, the block gets discarded. The hard part thus is finding a hash that fulfills this requirement. The miners are trying many, many, *many* different headers (some fields in the header can be changed in order to change the output hash value) before finally finding a hash that works. 
Other uses of hashing include the merkle tree. The root of the tree is a single hash that sits in the header. This tree is generated by using transaction hashes (another use) and then hashing those hashes together in pairs, until you end up at the top, where you combine the last two hashes together and get the root. This root is stored in the header. If you change any value in a transaction, then that will modify the tree all the way up to the root, which changes the header, which changes the header hash and now the hash is no longer valid, invalidating the block, etc. 
Another hash in the header is the hash of the previous block. This is how it forms a chain. So all work coming after a block depends on the blocks before it. So modifying an old block will invalidate all the work that came after it. And since it's so expensive to generate valid block hashes, you would need to expend an enormous amount of energy to generate replacement blocks in order to fool the network (the network follows the longest chain of valid blocks).

Mining and transaction throughput are not related. Mining difficulty is determined by block generation speed. The network tries to maintain an average of 10 minutes per new block and adjusts the difficulty based on that. 
The amount of energy spent to mine is what protects Bitcoin from attackers, because those attackers need to spend *more* energy in order to rewrite Bitcoin's history.

Correct. Every 210,000 blocks the block subsidy is halved. It started with 50.00000000 bitcoin, then it went to 25.00000000 bitcoin and it's now at 12.50000000 bitcoin. It will go down all the way to 0.00000001 bitcoin and after that it will go down to 0, at which point no new bitcoin will be created.


Given the numbers above, if you do the math, it's a little less than 21 million, but effectively 21 million, yes.

1) Mostly about reducing network latency and compute. Storage is mostly a solved problem (pruning).
2) This will most likely be the "last resort" option given how political (to keep it friendly) the ecosystem is when it comes to changes to Bitcoin.
3) There is a lot of research and development going on in Lightning. It's very exciting to see. 
There are predecessors that were only 1:1, without routing. They didn't catch on because the use cases were hampered by the on-chain settlement needed to setup a channel. Other off-chain solutions are not decentralized (like using custodial services that use a regular database to move funds around until you withdraw them). 
Keep in mind that the Bitcoin space is constantly moving.  We see new ideas and papers pop up all the time, some of which change the game completely. :) Segwit dropped in like a bomb, same as Lightning. Others were exciting, but didn't have the same kind of impact, but I fully expect to see more awesome developments in the years to come.

For me personally it was building my own bitcoin client. If you're not a programmer then that's obviously not a good way to learn about Bitcoin though. For any programmers out there: Try it! It doesn't have to be pretty, but learning how the communication protocol works, how the transactions and blocks work, how scripting works and then implementing all the various consensus rules really does wonders for your understanding of Bitcoin. It's awesome seeing transactions you created with your own client confirm on the test net blockchain. :)

Small corrections; You don't post the entire channel history, just the latest state of the channel, effectively closing the channel.
Lightning is regular bitcoin transactions and so it doesn't need a consensus algorithm. Calling it 'proof of stake' doesn't really fit.

The US dollar, Yen, Yuan, Euro, etc aren't backed by anything either. They are printed at will as has been demonstrated very clearly over the last decade. 
Mining, or more accurately, the expenditure of energy, is what secures Bitcoin's ledger, the blockchain. It requires a larger amount of energy to attack Bitcoin (rewrite its history) than it does to maintain it. This attack is known as the 51% attack. It requires an amount of energy greater than what the existing network consumes to rewrite Bitcoin's history. The further back you want to rewrite, the more energy you need.

Previous crashes were mostly caused by Mt.Gox in one way or another. In 2011 they got hacked, later they had willy bot and started driving up the price and then dumping the coins, they had their US bank account seized, and finally they were shut down when it turned out they 'lost' their cold storage coins (and tried to blame Bitcoin for it). 
Now that they are no longer around (this is the first bubble post Gox), it's going to be interesting to see where this ends.
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:04:39
Really hard to say. I was there for all the crashes, from the 2011 crash from $32 down to $2. Every one of them felt different. The 2011 one being the first one hurt the most. The long consolidation period afterward didn’t help. The $250 crash hurt less, but was still painful. The immediate difference was that after the crash, the eco system went on, atms started to come online, more exchanges, etc.  Then the $1200 one hit. By that time I didn’t really care that much anymore. It was mostly a feeling of “well, it’s going to take years to consolidate again, like 2011”. 
This one is unique because it’s the first one post-Gox. There’s no telling what will happen or where it will end.

Analogy doesn't really fit.
Here's a better example: A harddrive in a computer is incredibly slow when compared to memory. So what engineers came up with was using a memory buffer that holds often read / written data that is only periodically written back to the slow harddrive. This speeds up your computer significantly, since most of the work is now done in memory and doesn't have to wait for the harddrive. 
Lightning works the same way as cache memory. You can modify transactions in Lightning incredibly fast, since they're not committed to the blockchain directly. Only when you're done with a channel do you finally commit it to the blockchain. 
In the mean time, you can send and receive hundreds, thousands, even hundreds of thousands of transactions through a payment channel to anyone that's connected to the network. Since no blockchain resources are used, these transactions are incredibly cheap and since they are all point to point and not broadcast to every node, they are also incredibly fast. And since you are sending them 1:1 between 2 parties that both have to sign for them, you can't double spend.

Sure, there's a limit to making transactions smaller, but making blocks bigger isn't much of an improvement either. 
Another thing that's being worked on (although I'm not sure how far along that is and if it's possible to do without a hard fork) is signature aggregation across transactions down into a single signature per block. This will most likely only work for segwit based transactions and not regular transactions (due to transaction ID's changing if you pull signatures out of them), but should offer a quite substantial improvement. Both in terms of storage and in processing power (signature validation is expensive CPU wise), maybe then a block size increase is a viable option to add more capacity. 
One proposal for this is called flex cap. Basically the block size limit is gone, but blocks can't grow unbounded. Increases in block size would incur a cost to the miner so they can't increase it at their leisure. Whether that's through paying transaction fees forward or through a difficulty increase is still being debated. This is still firmly in the discussion phase and isn't being worked on code wise.
Mind you, none of the on-chain capacity increases will enable global adoption. It's simply impossible to record every single transaction in the world into a distributed ledger, no matter how small the transactions are or how big the blocks are. Off chain systems like Lightning are the best option for scaling.

Who you open channels to is not that important in Lightning. The only thing important is that you can route to the people / businesses / institutions that you want to transact with. 
Lightning 1.0 is being developed right now. In the future, payments will be a lot different than what you see in 1.0. Payments will be sharded and all the tiny pieces will follow different routes and reconstitute at the receiver. 
Later, payments will also shard over time. You'll be sending / receiving payments in tiny fractions smeared out over longer periods. Got a subscription to something? Why lump-sum it every month when you could be paying by the day / hour / minute / second? Same for payments to you. You could be receiving payments streamed over time. Your income is streaming in, your mortgage payments are streaming out. 
The underlying technology and who you connect to become irrelevant, mere details that are managed automatically. Channels will rebalance automatically, new channels will be created, old ones will be closed. You will be moved further away from this process, transactions will become cheaper and faster and easier.

This has nothing to do with there being a fee market or not. It has to do with high fees due to full blocks and then the edge case of trying to reclaim funds that are less than the fee of a transaction. 
Nobody wants high fees as was suggested in this case, but you can't deny that eventually fees are going to have to take over the function of the block subsidy or else the miners will stop mining and then network security will go down. 
The ideal situation would be having lots of transactions that by themselves have small fees but together are a significant payout to the miners to incentivize them to keep mining. In order to get there, more work will have to be done in order to support more transactions per block. Segregated Witness is one step, bigger blocks is another, but the most important one is speeding up block propagation across the network. 
The faster the blocks move across the network, the bigger they can be, the more transactions can be mined, the lower the fees can be.
@_date: 2015-12-29 20:33:18


No it's not. You have to account for all participants in this equation and that includes the users. If miners are short-term profit-maximizing, fees will trend towards zero because the users will see that a lower fee will yield the same quality of service.

Lightning funding transactions are mined into the blockchain. So you and another party want to set up a lightning channel; You do this by both funding a single transaction and then having that confirm. That transaction can only be spent by you and the other party if you *both* sign it. So it's a multi-sig transaction. Now the spending transaction is the "channel". You create a transaction with 2 outputs. One for you and one for the other end. When you send a payment to the other end, you update the outputs of that one transaction, re-sign it, send it to the other party, who then also signs it and then the channel is updated. If the other party wants to send money to you, he updates the output values, signs it and then sends it to you.
At any point in time can you choose to broadcast this transaction to the Bitcoin network. It will confirm and the channel is then closed. 
Since you can't spend the coins in the funding transaction without both parties signing, there's no risk of double spending. Since you can broadcast it at any time, there's no chance of the other party holding your coins hostage. Since you need to sign the transaction every time, there's no way for the other party to steal your coins.
There is no "byzantine fault tolerant" requirement in the above scenario. There is always full consensus, since you both need to sign the transaction. If it's not signed, then it didn't happen. 0 wiggle room. 
There is a ton more crypto going on in order to prevent broadcasting previous state and forwarding payments, etc, but the above is the gist of it. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 20:36:11
It sure is. And it will be in practice too. I'm not saying it's an alternative to increasing the block size in the short term, but it is a technical improvement for a large class of transactions in the medium term.

To add to this, this is a false dichotomy and it's wrong to boot. It argues that the block size is the only thing that would limit the max number of transactions on the network, which is not true. Soft caps set by miners do the same thing. 
Another factor is time delay. If you pay a low fee, it could take several blocks before your transaction is included. Time is also money. If you want fast confirmations, you pay for it. If not, then you can lower your fee. Currently Bitcoin Core doesn't have easy parameters for miners to setup such a tiered inclusion plan. 
Second, the argument that block size is somehow a useful tool to limit transaction volume is wrong. It's the most crude and heavy handed method of limiting transaction volume you can think of. It's a consensus rule that is extremely difficult to change (even if there is a legitimate reason to do so) and has the nasty possibility of triggering a parabolic rise in transaction fees. 
So I would argue the opposite. For a healthy fee market to develop, the block size should be sufficiently high that it doesn't have an effect on it. It should do what it was made for (preventing monster blocks) and nothing else. 
I would postulate that a fee market only works if *all* parties are free to act how they see fit. Miners should be able to set the fees they want and so should users. An equilibrium will be found. 
To address a criticism I've heard before, the argument that a "race to the bottom" will be likely, I disagree with that too. Over the long term, miners' primary income will be fees and the only way they will be able to make a living is to price their services appropriately. Trying to gobble up as many transactions as you can will indeed result in a race to the bottom, but it's against a miners own interest to do such a thing, since the following batch of transactions will take that action into account and will thus pay a lower fee, resulting in a lower future income for the miner in question. 
By creating an elastic, time based "artificial scarcity" (one that miners can influence so they can adapt to the market) everyone will be better off. Miners will earn an income and the users will have good security and a network that confirms their transactions.
This is known as a [Nash equilibrium]( Everyone should act in such a way that takes others' equilibrium strategies into account. Therefore a "race to the bottom" strategy won't occur because that would be against someones own best interest.

They can run block validation and construction on the side where all the others are and only send header + coinbase + Merkle branch of the coinbase to their mining operation. That's less than 1KB of data. When they find a block, they only have to send the header + coinbase back, which is less than 500 bytes. You could run this over dialup and suffer no ill effects, regardless of block size.
Hell, they could have block construction running continuously with updates to their mining op every minute or even faster and still not need anything more than dialup.
The bandwidth argument is pretty much moot.

There will most likely always be a max block size. It's not there just for the heck of it. It's to prevent a malicious miner from generating huge blocks that can clog the network. 
Don't get me wrong, I'm not a fan of using the max block size as a tool to force up fees. It's crude and can't adapt to market forces. It should do what it was meant to do, which is what I described above. Prevent monster blocks. Fees should be set by the miners and the scarce resource they should be selling is time, not space.

You're right, there aren't any hard technical reasons to do so, but there are *economical* reasons. By artificially limiting the number of transactions per block, they are creating artificial scarcity. The fact that this isn't done for technical reasons is a Good Thing. It means that miners are more economically aware of the service that they're providing and charging appropriately for it. If it was for technical reasons, then that would have a distorting effect on the fee market. That's a Bad Thing.


Yup. And that means that the sender of that transaction just had to wait 10 minutes (or more) for his transaction to be mined. If he was in a hurry, he would have paid a little bit more to be included into a block faster, resulting in higher income for whichever miner that decided that that was enough for it to be included in this current block. Time (from first seen to when it's included into a block, roughly) is now a marketable resource. 


And yet this doesn't happen in the real world at all, because that would destroy whatever market you're in. You optimize to maximize towards a sustainable level of income. One where demand and supply are in equilibrium over the long term. If you have millions of dollars invested in hardware, you're not going to try and optimize towards zero, you'd be shooting yourself in the foot. You wouldn't be able to pay off your initial hardware investment, let a lone make a profit.


The bottom in any industry is not zero. It's production cost + profit. The same goes for miners. They made real investments in mining hardware that need to be paid off over time. They need to charge for their services.
By setting up a tiered payment schedule, they can price their services and create a market that is both profitable for them and gives users a choice. Simple example: High -&gt; get included as fast as possible. medium fee -&gt; in the next 2-3 blocks or so, low fee -&gt; in the next 4 - 6, etc.

They can have a cheap VPS running in the US or any other western country that does actual validation / block construction and have it only send the header + coinbase transaction + Merkle branch for that transaction to the mining operation in China. Once a block is found, you send that same updated data back and then the VPS broadcasts the block. That's around 1KB of data for a 20MB block. You could run that over a dial-up connection.

The problem with address reuse in this case doesn't have anything to do with security or privacy as others have mentioned. The problem is that the merchant can't assume that you were in control of that address. If you used a web wallet like Coinbase, there is a good chance that they would not be able to connect that refund back to your account because they spend from pooled addresses. The payment protocol (BIP70) addresses this by letting the users' wallet specify a refund address explicitly.

SW capacity depends on transaction type. Regular P2PKH transactions won't see a 2 fold benefit, but P2SH transactions will go beyond that. Regardless, I never said it would be "double capacity".

I think it was his idea all along to keep the discussion going and force the other devs (and the community to some extent) to figure things out. I don't think he had any illusions that his 20mb patch would make it into master and even the XT fork was merely used as leverage to keep people engaged. The 1mb cap problems were too abstract of a threat to spur people into action, whereas a forked client that is rumored to have broad support is a much clearer 'danger' to Bitcoin Core.
This 1mb ceiling has been looming over our heads for so long now, it needs to be addressed. Whether or not it's a real problem has become completely irrelevant as the *perception* of it being a problem is doing a lot more damage, even though that damage is hard to quantize.
Edit: also, it's not just this particular issue that's bad for bitcoin's image. It's also the fact that there is no movement forward that is being used to demonstrate that the devs have "lost their way". I'm not saying this is true, that's not important. It's the perception by the outside world that's the issue and the only way to fix that is to solve the block size 'problem' in a satisfying way.

Miners have said that they're leaving the fees low for now because they'd rather have more people using the system. 
Knowing that, it's no wonder that a fee market hasn't materialized yet. One group of participants is not engaging. That, and the lack of proper tools for both miners and users. If miners had better tools to setup their fee schedules and could somehow provably post that that's how they prioritize transactions, then wallets can present that to the user in a user friendly way (fast, medium, slow, etc type of fees) and work out the details behind the scenes.

That's a nice misrepresentation of the past.

Of course they can. You could run a LN node with 0 fees and your neighbor could run one that charges 1 Satoshi per transaction. Fees are set by you, the user, if you choose to route payments for others. 
The Lightning Network isn't a true network per se, it's a collection of 1 to 1 connections that together can form a graph network at the discretion of each individual node and they can apply their own routing rules and fees.

Bitcoin today can't handle the entire world's transactions, so that comparison doesn't really say much. Access *is* currently restricted by bytes, which is why segregated witness is currently being worked on. To increase effective capacity in such a way that it can grow organically through user adoption. There are a number of performance issues that have to be addressed (wrt block propagation) first before the block size can be increased.

Coinbase does not give out private keys. If the value of your bitcoin is too low for a transaction, you can just keep them in coinbase for now. Once it's a bit higher value, you can move them to GDAX, their exchange platform and withdrawing from there is a lot cheaper (don't ask me why, I really don't know).
@_date: 2015-12-29 20:16:40
And they will. Nobody is restricting access to the bottom layer. The characteristics of Bitcoin proper simply make it a poor choice for that type of transaction. That goes for pretty much all in-person short encounter payments (think Starbucks, groceries, gas station, bus ticket, etc). 
Many other payments will probably be totally fine on-chain, ones where time is less of a factor, like online payments, rent, mortgage, salary, etc.
Making Bitcoin better means accepting what its strengths *and* weaknesses are and trying to make improve the weaknesses. Lightning is such an improvement. It preserves all of Bitcoin's characteristics (decentralized, censor proof, etc) and improves speed and security for time constrained payments.

I remember vaguely (though there's a good chance that I'm wrong) that you pay income tax over the net profit of the mined coins. Say you have $200 worth of bitcoin and you spend $100 on electricity and a partial write-off of the hardware (which has to be over X years, you should be able to look this up), you would have a net income of $100, which you would have to add to your total income. Not sure what would happen if you didn't sell it immediately though.

Some miners start mining on a new block only after having verified the header (and not the content) and verify the content in parallel to that.

No, the website acts as the wallet front-end. The Trezor is a USB dongle and is the signing 'back-end'. All it does is hold private keys and sign transactions. 
Right now there's no other wallet that supports it yet (at least, nothing that's released yet), so we'll have to make do with the website for a bit. When Electrum and Multibit HD are released, then we can move away from the web interface and use those instead. 
There's nothing inherently restrictive about the Trezor. Any wallet on any platform that allows client USB connections (and software access) can use it. 
Android phones for example could very well be a target for Trezor support, but it depends on the wallet developers (and I'm not sure how open the USB access is) to support it.

Most of those are probably dust rain, meant to tie addresses together once they're spent. 
If you don't want some anonymous actor to know which addresses you control, it's best to get rid of those keys or move those dust transactions out of your wallet.
One way to do that is by using Dust-B-Gone. A script written by Peter Todd, one of the bitcoin core developers. It takes those transactions and sends them to his server where they are all combined and spent in a transaction with a 0btc output, effectively giving the dust to the miners. 
If you are weary of connecting to his server directly, it has the option of connecting through TOR. 
Dust-B-Gone can be found here: 
I've used it myself not too long ago and works like a charm. You may have to set the dust limit to 0.001 BTC for it to find the transaction(s). You can run it initially as a dry run by specifying --dry-run and it'll show you a raw dump of the transaction it'll send out.

It's decentralized because it's open source, it can be forked and changed. In fact, most miners run a custom setup of Bitcoin Core that changes the way transactions are selected that they want add to a block.

I'm not sure what you mean by this. The Satoshi client never had incentives for regular nodes. If you mean that anyone could mine back in the day, then yes. But this didn't last very long though and it wasn't intended as a way to keep nodes on the network. 


I'm a game developer and I know full well that eye candy sells. :) But the requirements for running a full node are only getting higher. Right now, I'm not even comfortable running one on my 250GB capped internet connection, although I think there is talk of adding throttling controls to a later version (not sure when that'll go in though), which would make it more manageable for people with capped internet connections.

More transactions per block. Little fees add up to quite a bit. New Bitcoin will be generated until the year 2140. The number of transactions per block will continue to rise over time. The block size limit that's in place today will eventually be increased. Right now it's used as a spam deterrent.

Ease of payment was never really a main argument for bitcoin. Hell, even paypal is working on a solution that makes payments super easy. And I still don't consider them a threat to bitcoin. 
Security, cheaper, faster, censor proof, global, no barriers to entry, those are the main arguments for bitcoin. 
And the western world is not the place where this is going to take off first. It's going to be countries like Argentina, Venezuela, etc, where bitcoin will be mass-adopted first.

Changing the block time affects several things:
- Coins are generated faster, so you'd have to change the issuance schedule to make sure coins are still generated until 2140 like it is today.
- You would need more confirmations per transaction to get the same kind of security. Currently, 6 confirmations is considered sufficient to assume the coins won't revert and a double spend happens. If you halved the block time, you'd need to double the confirmations needed to get the same amount of work.

You wouldn't need a blockchain. The private keys you have in your bitcoin wallet are enough. Then you can build a simple challenge / response system.
When you create an account, you send them a public key, and then when you log in, they send you a random sequence of numbers. You hash that sequence, then sign it and send the signature back to the website. 
They can then verify that the signature was created with the private key associated with the public key they have on file.
I think there are already some solutions out there for this.
Edit: Also, if that website is ever compromised, then there's nothing useful for them to steal. They can't use that public key for anything other than verifying signatures, so they can't even use it to break into other websites where you have the same public key on file.

The block time has to do with consensus. It has nothing to do with the hashing algorithm. There are coins out there that have shorter block times, like dogecoin, and the result is that the tip of their blockchain is in constant flux. It becomes harder for their network to reach consensus. More stale blocks, wasted effort, confirmation numbers on transactions reverting, etc. 
This is unlikely to change in bitcoin because, well, frankly, it's kind of irrelevant. 
The risk of a double spend drops considerably in the first few seconds after a transaction has been sent. And for a cup of coffee, if the payment processor listens to a sufficient number of nodes and doesn't see a double spend in the first few seconds, then that's good enough.
For larger transactions, say, when buying a car, you don't care about fast confirmations anyway. In fact, reaching 6 confirmations takes about an hour most of the time, which is already significantly faster than a regular bank transaction (usually one or more business days).

I think Ethereum looks promising, but so far I'm not impressed by their execution.
The auction is the wrong way to go about it, moving 100% of the risk onto the users, while the developers load up on bitcoins without actually delivering anything initially. 
The testnet 'launch' last friday is nothing more than a link to github and some build instructions for a bare bones client that can handle a single address.
I'd say it's going to take them at least another 6 months to a year before the first version goes live and their genesis block is mined.

It has to do with several things. First, the SSL encoding style that bitcoin uses allows you to express the numbers in the signature in multiple ways. Leading zeroes are usually stripped off, but the signature is still valid if they are present. 
Second, due to elliptic curve math, there are two ways to express a signature. 
The fix is to make the validation of the numbers more strict (don't allow leading zeroes) and second, to only allow one expression of the signature (where part of it has to be less than X, where X is a specific value that I can't recall right now).
These changes are already made in most wallets, but it can't be enforced on the network yet, because that would be a forking change (soft, hard, I don't know). I think that there are already relay restrictions in place, but I'm not entirely sure.

There are two different algorithms that protect most of the transactions in the blockchain. The first one is hash functions, specifically, SHA256 and RIPEMD160. These two functions are quantum hard. That means, there's no quantum computer algorithm that can generate a collision that would allow you to change blocks or attack part of the signature verification (the part that checks if the SHA256+RIPEMD160 hash of the public key is the same as the address that was in the transaction output). 
The second part is elliptic curve cryptography. In bitcoin's case, secp256k1. This algorithm is not quantum hard. That means that with a sufficiently advanced quantum computer, it's possible to find the private key given a public key. It basically comes down to solving the [discrete logarithm problem]( which is one of the things that QC's can accelerate.
For the second case, if EC was broken, then transactions would only be exposed if the public key for an address is publicly known. Given that most wallets are moving to an HD setup, keys aren't reused anymore, so the window of breaking a public key and then trying to steal the coins is limited to a very short time in which the attacker sees the unconfirmed transaction and the time that it has sufficiently propagated the network that all double spends are rejected. 
In any event, bitcoin's crypto is pluggable and can be upgraded should any of these algorithms break.
Mind you, those algorithms aren't going to just break at any random point in time. In crypto, those algorithms tend to 'deteriorate' over time. Optimizations to brute force an algorithm are found making it slightly easier to break them, etc, etc. This is currently the case for the SHA1 and MD5 family of hashing functions and even RSA with low key sizes. 
tl;dr: We're fine for the time being.

That is because right now, side chains are purely theoretical. There's no need to spell out in detail what they can and cannot do until the fundamental principles of side chains have been laid out and any potential security issues have been addressed. 


This is not true and is trivially demonstrated: There are no "side chain admins". If side chains become a reality, then they will be distributed in the very same way that bitcoin currently is. That's the whole point of them. To have an alternate chain with alternate rules, but distributed in the same way that bitcoin is.


Hey, where did your side chain admins go?


Oh! There the are!
A side chain is nothing more than an 'empty' blockchain, running in very much the same way an alt coin does. The only difference is that it doesn't create its own asset. The asset is moved in and out of another chain, like bitcoin. 
Whatever argument you have against side chains can be applied to every crypto coin currently in existence. And it's then that you see how completely ridiculous you sound.
@_date: 2014-12-01 07:42:08
Bitcoin is not a ponzi because it doesn't offer a guaranteed return on investment. In fact it doesn't even pretend to be an investment at all. It's just an alternate form of money. Nothing more, nothing less. Its value floats against all other forms of money and nothing in the system has any kind of control over the conversion rate.
Calculating the bitcoins 'in theory' is not that hard.
The starting reward was 50 bitcoins per block. This reward halves every 210,000 blocks. We are currently at block 332,410
So there are 210,000 blocks with a 50 bitcoin reward and
there are 332,410 - 210,000 = 122,410 blocks with a 25 bitcoin reward. That makes:
210,000 * 50 + 122,410 * 25 = 13,560,250 bitcoin that can currently exist. However, that number is lower, since it is not required to pay out the maximum allowable coinbase value. The only test done is to check if the new coins + fees is less than or equal to the allowable amount. [Here]( is where the maximum values is calculated and [here]( is where it's used. As you can see, it only checks if the value is greater than the allowed value. Not equal.
Summing the UTXO works, but again, only to an extent. There are a lot of unspendable outputs where coins are sent to 'burner' addresses. Addresses that do not have a private key associated with them. So in reality, it's pretty hard to figure out how many bitcoin are actually available and that's completely ignoring all the lost bitcoin.

Regarding 6.1, I don't think that proof-of-work is a viable solution since nodes range from mobile phone all the way up to pools of miners, so the POW computation time is vastly different between the two. Incidentally, that's also why I think that POW doesn't work in Bitmessage, but I digress.
6.2 I think it's incorrect to assume that when you connect to the bitcoin network over the open internet that you can expect any kind of anonymity.  The bitcoin protocol and the Bitcoin Core client currently don't contain any mechanisms to hide a node's activities on the network and it's debatable whether or not the suggestions provided here should be implemented. They could be, not too hard to add delays to transaction propagation, or even lowering the connected nodes, but these measures do affect the time it takes for transactions to saturate in the entire network, which can affect double spend attempts.
Rotating the nonce (to protect against the NAT related 'identity' leak) would help (although I'm not entirely sure how the nonce is generated in Bitcoin Core) and rotating through connections helps too. The last one was also mentioned in the paper, but I don't think that tying in the frequency of sent transactions to the connection life span is smart. It's another piece of information that can be analyzed (nodes with short lived connections -&gt; must be sending lost of transactions). 
Anyway, if you check the bitcoin-dev mailing list, the focus is mostly on the TOR related weaknesses because there you *do* expect some measure of anonymity when sending transactions, and that's the interesting problem... :)

Bitcoin started off at difficulty 1, currently the difficulty is much higher, but you could theoretically generate a chain that stays difficulty 1 and generate a much longer chain than the one we currently have. The network would not accept your longer chain, because the cumulative work of that chain is much lower than the current one.

This probably means you'll have to ship the device with root certificates on the device and any updates to the this list must be signed by you. Also, support for revocation lists to block compromised certificates.
Overall, I think you've got a nice list of secure requirements, albeit a very long list. If you compare it to the Trezor, which is already out there, what do you think the Trezor lacks *at a hardware level* that your device will do better? The reason I mention at a hardware level is that the Trezor software stack is still in development. Multisig support, alternate wallet provider support, BIP70 support is all being worked on.

That's because addresses aren't accounts. When you send a transaction, you're basically forwarding outputs from other transactions. If you have multiple transactions that send coins to address X, and you then want to send some bitcoin to address Y, your wallet software will select a number of input transactions that, when added together, will be enough to send bitcoin to the address Y. So it could be that it didn't need all of the available transactions that were sent to address X in order to make a payment to address Y. It only sends the remainder of the bitcoin that didn't go to address Y but *was* used as input to a change address. The other transactions that were sent to address X remain untouched. 
Hope that makes sense.
Edit: Blockchain.info isn't the best place to see what's going on with transactions. Have a look at [this transaction]( on blockexplorer.com. And [here it is]( on blockchain.info. Blockchain.info collapses the inputs of the same address together, but block explorer shows you that there are multiple inputs from the same address being referenced. If you look at [the final balance]( of that address, you'll see that there's still more bitcoin associated with that address than the change that was sent back, meaning that there are other unspent transaction outputs available for that address.

To expand on my comment a little bit, bitcoin is 10% code and 90% game theory. When the core devs are discussing changes to the protocol, 9 times out of 10, they're not talking about specific implementation details, but discussing what kind of effect something has on the current eco system. If it changes incentives for any of the involved parties (devs, miners, merchants, payment processors, users, etc), or if it can potentially be abused, etc. 
In short, most of the energy in development of the bitcoin protocol involves not upsetting the balance, or at least, trying to shape bitcoin to be balanced for all parties and trying to discourage bad behaviour. The dust spam filter is a good example of that. Lots of discussion about a simple little change to the IsStandard function. A function not even critical to bitcoin's operation, yet the change generated pages and pages of discussion and even news articles.
Another example is side chains (granted, not part of the bitcoin protocol). The reason that people are excited about it is that there's a new development in the 10% part, the code (SPV proofs, SNARKs, new crypto, yay), but almost all of the discussion we see about it involves the other 90%. It gives miners too much power and they can steal coins(how do we fix that), what will it mean for bitcoin in the long run if a side chain becomes more popular, etc.

No it doesn't. As long as you don't meddle with the consensus code, you can change pretty much anything you want. That doesn't make it an alt coin.


OP asked about the Bitcoin Core codebase, not 3rd party processors.


Exactly. And the fee structure isn't consensus critical. There are some fee rules to prevent spam and big transactions, but other than that, anything goes. If you can get your transaction into the mempool of enough miners and it isn't relegated to the end of the queue, then it'll end up in a block sooner or later. As I said, most miners change this code themselves. It's not something that the devs have all that much power over (that goes for a lot of things actually).

But just to answer your questions. Bitcoin and Litecoin work with what is called a block chain. In the case of Bitcoin, about every 10 minutes (Litecoin it's 2.5 minutes), a new block is found and added to the chain. This will show up as a message in your miner, letting you know that it's useless to continue the work it's doing now and to fetch a new packet of work for the next block. 
Mining Bitcoin is hard, because so many people are doing it right now and the hardware has become so specialized. Mining one of the scrypt coins, like litecoin, dogecoin, etc, is easier and you can sell those for bitcoin on exchanges that trade those coins.

False. Large miners especially run custom setups with their own transaction acceptance and block building rules. On top of that, many of them are reluctant to upgrade to the latest and greatest. 
Case in point:


False. The reason there was even a fork was because a large number of miners hadn't upgraded to 0.8.0 of Bitcoin Core. And the only immediate action was asking upgraded miners to please revert back to the latest version of the 0.7.x line.

Automatic scaling is too easily manipulated and can't be verified after the fact.
The problem is incentives for miners. Right now miners are incentivized to generate small blocks because they propagate faster. When that problem is solved, bigger blocks will be less of an issue.
The transaction fee free market is something that isn't really an issue right now. That's something that starts to become a problem after another few halvings, more than enough time to figure that out.

Sad to see that they've got this completely backwards. Miners are subject to the free market like everything else in Bitcoin. If mining is no longer profitable, then miners will start to cease operations, just like we saw with CPU miners, GPU miners and 1^st gen ASIC miners. Difficulty will drop, cost will go down, equilibrium will be reached, etc. There is always someone out there that's willing to pick up transactions with lower fees if they can make a profit.

That's not how it works. You create an 'account' at the ATM when you first use it, at that point the palm scan is associated with your ID. 
So Robocoin is building a database of ID + palm scan in order to ensure that it's always the same person at the ATM and not someone that stole your ID.

It is. Decentralized doesn't mean "less than X% of the network is controlled by one entity". It means that there is no single entity that controls entry into the system. In other words, even if ghash controls 51%, there is no way for them to prevent others from bringing more hashing power online to push back.
The market reacted exactly the way it was predicted. Ghash obtained 51%, shitstorm ensued, people left ghash, additional hashing power was brought online and R&amp;D was increased to find better ways to prevent it from happening again. 
These are the birth pains of a novel system. It's not going to be pretty for the first years, maybe even the first decade, but every "event" like this will leave the network stronger.

If a miner gains &gt; 50% of the network, the value of Bitcoin would collapse (people lose trust in the system), resulting in lower income for the miner. So this would hurt the miner more than help him. Ergo, a miner has an economic incentive NOT to pass 50% or even come close to it. We've seen that happen with GHash.IO a while ago and the drama that resulted from it.

Then you don't really understand the significance of those features.


The blockchain is secure, and sent transactions are secure. Individual wallet implementations may be lacking, but that's being addressed. This is not an inherent flaw in the bitcoin network.


It costs mere pennies to send a transaction, as opposed to percentages with credit cards.


I can send a bitcoin transaction to anyone, anywhere, of arbitrary size. You cannot alter the destination of any transaction not sent by you, you cannot block it, you cannot reverse it. Censor proof.


It's faster than credit cards too. It takes mere seconds to receive a transaction and have enough confidence that the transaction isn't being double spent (with a proper back-end implementation). Settlement of a bitcoin payment takes an hour on average (given you're adhering to the fee rules of the network) as opposed to *months* with credit cards.


You still can't use your credit card in the vast majority of countries. And you still can't send a wire transfer to a number of countries. Bitcoin is borderless. There's no difference between sending a bitcoin transaction to your neighbour or sending one to the other end of the planet.


There is nothing stopping me from running a bitcoin client and offering my services for payment in bitcoin. No credit checks, no account approvals, etc. On top of that, there are numerous bitcoin ATM's out there that you can walk up to and buy your first bitcoin. 


Can you imagine what will happen if Apple's database with hundreds of millions of cc numbers is hacked?


No, it won't because bitcoin isn't centralized. If you use a local wallet then there is no such threat. As stated time and time again, if you trust others to hold your bitcoin for you (coin base, circle, etc) then that's your choice. But it's not a requirement (as opposed to having an iTunes account with a credit card attached).
@_date: 2014-06-27 06:09:03

A customer and merchant can optionally agree on any third party that offers this service for a small fee. 
It's a free market, meaning, there are multiple third party providers that offer this service and they all compete on price and trustworthiness. As I said before, they never have the power to take the money and run, so it comes down to two metrics: Fee and reputation. 
That's a key difference with credit cards. In the case of credit cards, you're stuck always paying for this feature and you have no choice other than choosing which credit card provider you want when you get a credit card. And for a merchant there's no choice what so ever. He's stuck with whatever credit card provider that the customer has, and as we all know, in most cases the credit card provider will side with the consumer, shafting the merchant. 
When I want to buy groceries, I'm not interested in consumer protection, since I go to the same store for years on end. When I buy a car, I'm also not interested in consumer protection since there are contracts involved, etc. It's basically only relevant when I'm dealing with parties that I don't trust, like an ebay seller or small webshop I've never used.

- Miners are financially motivated and therefore they are risk averse. Anything that threatens their hardware investments and any potential contracts for offloading coins will be rejected. Number one on that list is going over 51% as it has a significant impact on price, especially if the 51% is sustained or grows.
- Most of the miners you see on the [hash distribution pie chart]( are pools. That means that they are collectives of independent miners working together. If the pool operator goes rogue then those miners will start to move away from that pool to other pools as it affects their income. The best example for that is GHash.IO, who went from 50+% down to 15% right now. 
Don't let that chart fool you. There are a LOT of mining outfits and all of them are in it for the money, plain and simple. Anything that affects them will be dealt with. If a pool operator, or a cartel of pool operators tries to force a protocol change or starts to block miners from moving their funds, then the participants of those pools will move away.

Another thing to keep in mind is that miners can make the coinbase transaction pretty big at very little cost to themselves.

Multi party is a different problem (although it uses the same technology) than single user multisig. 
Single user is done to make it significantly harder to steal coins. Instead of one target, you now have two.
In the single user case, you have one extended private key on the device, one in cold storage and a third one one a remote server. On the device and server, you have all three extended public keys, so you can create addresses locally and the server can monitor. When making a payment, you sign the transaction locally, send it off to the server, if it meets all the requirements you set, then it signs too, sends it back, and you and the server can both broadcast it to the network.
The cool thing is that you are not dependent on the 3rd party. You hold 2 of the 3 extended keys, so if the remote server keels over or is compromised, you don't lose your coins. Secondly, if your device is compromised (including whatever security measures needed to access the server) then you self imposed limits can prevent total loss of your coins.
All of this can be done completely transparent to the user, including never reusing addresses.
@_date: 2014-11-16 08:48:15
Although the transactions had different hashes and the double spend prevention code was triggered, the transactions themselves always contained the same transaction outputs, so they weren't actual double spends. A double spend tries to use (some of) the same inputs as an existing unconfirmed transaction and send them on to different addresses. That wasn't the case with those slightly altered transactions.

Purely theoretical, all bitcoin clients that do not depend on hardware encrypted keys are susceptible to these kinds of attacks. Solutions like Trezor stop these types of attacks, but the workflow is more difficult than simply using a software wallet (and they're expensive).

I think that's the wrong comparison to make. Bitcoin isn't a brand. It's a protocol / platform. Just like the Internet with TCP/IP. a platform with a dominant protocol. Everything pretty much runs over TCP/IP. IP at least, maybe there's some UDP here and there and some other control protocols to keep everything running smooth (like ICMP, SNMP, GRE, etc).
You're not going to see competition in this space because it doesn't matter. Not even IPv6, which offers more features / bigger address space can compete with IPv4. There's no one earning money off the use of TCP/IP. 
Same with Bitcoin. There is no monopoly / lock in if every internet payment were to use Bitcoin. That's why alts don't really stand much of a chance. I personally don't even see Ethereum as that big of a competitor to Bitcoin. Bitcoin solves the problem it meant to solve. Everything else will simply be built on top of it despite any other system that may offer better features. The battle is pretty much over.

Where am I ignoring his concerns? On a side note, there's valid concerns and 'valid concerns'. I'd put these concerns in the same category as "what would happen to bitcoin if the entire internet were to be shut down". They're hypothetical concerns. Totally valid, but hardly worrisome. 


As I said before, the fee rules are not consensus critical and would not trigger a hard fork. You really need to brush up on your bitcoin knowledge.


Then keep that discussion in that thread. There's no need to bring that into this discussion.


The core devs have 'power' over the codebase, but only up to a certain point. The rest of the users, the miners, the merchants, the people running nodes, the users, all have a choice in whether or not they accept the version published by the core devs. Most of that development is consensus driven. Important changes are discussed ad nauseam before they are committed to the dev line. Everyone can voice their concerns and most actually do. And even then there's the choice to fork the code and not use the version published by the core devs.

There's nothing meaningless about securing a $5B economy. An attacker would have to do the same kind of work to attack the block chain that a miner does, and the chance of them failing is considerable. In fact, cooperating in the mining scheme is more profitable than attacking the network. That's the beauty of it. Playing by the rules is more profitable than cheating.

Side chains only make sense if the Bitcoin moved to / from it can be used on that chain in a useful way. So if a country wants to relent control of their money supply, then that would be quite a step for digital currencies as a whole. If they want to maintain control of their own money supply, then that would defeat the purpose of running a decentralized side chain pegged to bitcoin. 


would you let him in?"
I think the premise is flawed. This example implies that bitcoin is somehow my 'business'. It isn't. I have no problem moving away from bitcoin to a more successful alternative, provided that I don't lose my existing funds (a 1:1 peg would be preferred). I think that would be the case for a lot of people. Why wouldn't I want to move to a digital currency that offers more functionality?

This isn't reorg safe. If the blockchain switches over to a new tip, the transaction in question could either not be included, be at a different height, or at a different index in the block. edit: also, you need to reference the transaction output in question. A transaction can have more than one transaction output paying to different addresses. You need to target the correct one. So now you're up to 3 numbers. Starting to move into 'scary' territory again.
The bitcoin industry (wallet developers) are moving to HD wallets that will reduce address reuse drastically. Additionally they're focussing on hiding the address as much as they can, exactly because it's so 'scary'. Payment protocol support is improving and removes the need to check the address, NFC / bluetooth payments hide the address, etc.

A trezor is actually both at the same time. When setting up the trezor, you're presented with a 24 word backup seed that you are strongly advised to write down. You can optionally encrypt that seed with a password if you so choose, but beware, if you want to store it for 10 years, it better be a password you can remember.
After that, you've got your trezor with unlimited keys (you don't need to connect the trezor to generate a new key and receive) and a paper backup. You can receive and spend from it, which is far better than just a paper wallet.

As many people have told you repeatedly, the vast majority of user value bitcoin for the rules as they are today. What's the point of using bitcoin if there is another centralized form of control that arbitrarily rewrites history and changes the rules? In other words. The value *will* drop, regardless of what you say the Chinese will do. They may have large volume right now, but that's completely artificial as they have 0 fee trading platforms. If fees were introduced, their volume would drop like a rock and would start to reflect a more proper marketplace.

I know nothing about Xapo or Meridian, but the whole point of getting insurance is to cover potential losses that are higher than what you have in capital.
The insurance company will calculate the odds of the policy executing and based on that it will give you coverage. This could be several orders of magnitude higher than your initial bet. In fact, it gets higher if the risk is lower, in other words, if Xapo spent several million setting up a cold storage facility that meets or exceeds all the requirements that the insurance company has, odds are that you're going to get pretty good coverage.
Also, meridian could very well be covering its own policy with several other insurance companies. This is standard procedure for high value policies.

1. If you want to run a full node, then no. You need all the block data so that bootstrapping nodes can sync from you.
2. It generates indices and an UTXO (unspent transaction outputs) database. It took 5 years for bitcoin to reach this size. [Here's a historical growth graph]( You can probably plot out how long it will take before your 40GB is full.
@_date: 2014-12-14 21:52:04
First and foremost, you don't have to do anything you're not comfortable with.
1. You would need a local wallet application. You don't have to go with Bitcoin Core (that's the one that uses wallet.dat files) as it's the reference client and downloads the entire blockchain. You could try Electrum or Multibit for example. Just try it out with $1 worth of bitcoin first before you move larger amounts.
2. No! You have to print out a paper wallet that includes the *private key*. This is a long number, not the address that you usually see (the ones that start with 1 or 3). The private key starts with a 5 and is longer than an address. Have a look at  Read everything on the page, download it to your local computer and start playing around with it.
The wallet (.dat) and the paper wallet *aren't* connected. That's the point. :) 
Bitcoins are divisible down to 8 decimal places, but they don't all have a unique number.
Bitcoins only exist inside transactions. These transaction outputs (where the bitcoin values are stored) can then be spent using the private keys you have in your wallet. 
You can have multiple transactions that have outputs with various values that are all 'sent' to one address. that means that all those outputs can be 'spent' using the same private key. 
This is all handled behind the scenes by your wallet software. 
You can thus send multiple transactions to a single paper wallet. The private key in the paper wallet can then be imported again (try this first!) and then you can 'spend' those transactions in a new transaction, etc.
Private keys and addresses are not the same thing..
It works like this:
Private key -&gt; Public key -&gt; Address.
That means, A private key generates a public key and that generates an address.
Generating a public key from an address is really hard and generating a private key from a public key is harder still. That's where the security in bitcoin comes from. You stand a better chance of getting hit by lightning, a meteor and being eaten by a shark, all at the same time, 100 times in a row than you have at guessing someone's private keys from their addresses.

Community decisions are tough. It's hard to reach consensus most of the time and the best way in that case (sadly) is to just do it and see who wins. The choice of moving to bits, mBTC, uBTC is a good example for this.
When it comes to technical issues, in most cases a proposal is made, technical discussion happens on IRC, the bitcointalk forums, the dev mailing list and eventually a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) is drafted. Once that proposal matures, it's usually with broad consensus and most parties with a vested interest will adopt those proposals.

With b2b you can go even further. Most companies have a rolling payment agreement, where money trickles in in chunks and are deducted from outstanding debts, so, say you have the following bills:
Jan: $1,000.00
Feb: $1,000.00
Mar: $1,000.00
and the customer (business), then pays 
Jan: $800,00
Feb: $1,100.00
Mar: $1,100.00
The opportunity for bitcoin in these cases is that Business A (the one buying stuff from business B) can actually request payment addresses from business B that it then forwards to its own customers. So instead of paying business A, they're actually directly sending their money to business B. 
So not only are they saving on time, they are also reducing the number of transactions that are taking place. 
And there's no need to stop there. Business B could do the same thing with business C, or even trickle wage payments in the same way. 
So you could actually end up with a situation where Johnny buys a new pair of headphones online only to see that the money he spent ended up back in is own wallet (Johnny -&gt; NewEgg -&gt; Chinese supplier -&gt; American ad company -&gt; Johnny).

They'll quickly find out that they'll run into issues when securing the blocks (power struggle) and issuing coins. 
A blockchain only makes sense if it's treaded like a public good. A platform where nobody has the upper hand. That only works if enough independent parties participate and in order to get those parties to participate you need incentives. Those incentives would be predictable payouts on the ledger itself. Random doesn't work (as shown by Doge, miners will mine big, profitable blocks, but move hashing power elsewhere if the reward is not high enough) and having an issuing body doesn't work either because then mining makes no sense. 
So really, It's either bitcoin's model or back to the regular centralized model they have today. There really is no middle ground that makes any sense.

Miners already collect transaction fees. The block subsidy halves every 4 years and in 2140 it will reach 0.

In any other software project you would be right, but in this case the software is the specification. Bitcoin Core has consensus, and the bips follow. If a discrepancy is found between the two, the bips are adjusted, not the software (or else the software would lose consensus).

Checkpoints on valid (mined by the community) blocks, to invalidate HoB chains. All their effort is subsequently rendered void.
Another option is to change the way the "longest chain" is calculated. Currently it's the sum of the difficulty, but that could be changed to something like the sum of the age of spent coins, so any attempt to stall the network would be ineffective. This would be a soft fork (not a protocol change, but a behavioural change). Gavin mentioned something like this on his blog, but can't find the link right now.

You're not paying the webshop. The webshop is sending you a payment request with an address from the supplier instead. So your money goes directly to the supplier. And the supplier could have done the same thing, giving the webshop an address from one of its suppliers instead. All of these payment requests will have been signed, so they all act as proofs of payment together with that one transaction sent by the customer. Each and every sale by the webshop can be routed differently, one as I described and a following one as a salary payment, one as pure profit, etc.

There are ways to get 0 fee transactions into the blockchain faster. It's called [Child Pays for Parent]( which basically means that miners will accept transactions - with fee - that try to spend unconfirmed 0 fee transactions.

This has nothing to do with merged mining. Jeff was simply giving some back story on ways that miners try to supplement their income. One way is merged mining (since it doesn't cost any extra hashing power) and another is striking deals with non mining entities (like bitpay or coinbase) to prioritize their transactions.
A lot of miners have already implemented the change (or something similar) that ~~Jeff~~ Wladimir merged today. It's not mentioned, but I can imagine the "something similar" actually being a reason this was merged.
Eligius blocks certain transactions (mostly to dice sites), and as a result, they can be used to double spend. [Peter Todd actually demonstrated the exploit]( sending a legit transaction to a vendor, with an extra output to a dice site, and then sending double spend to Eligius directly that won't be blocked by them. If Eligius wins the race, then you've successfully executed a double spend. 
So instead of blocking transactions (like Eligius wants), it's safer to set their priority really low, so they do end up in the mempool, and then the exploit is no longer possible (since it will be detected as a double spend).

It'll be quite some time before machines will be transacting with one another. Autonomous agents that transact with humans will likely come first, like self driving taxis.
But I think bitcoin's killer app will be b2b solutions; and more specifically payment forwarding. Instead of sending bitcoin transactions, companies will send payment requests to each other in real-time where the end result will be a single transaction satisfying multiple debts between multiple parties.
Say a customer wants to buy a pair of alpaca socks. He orders them on the website and wants to pay with bitcoin. He is presented with a payment request and makes the payment in very much the same way as it's done right now. But what the customer doesn't know is that that request actually came from one of the suppliers of that webshop. And what the webshop doesn't know is that that request came from a supplier of its supplier, etc. The end result is that there could be several forwards of payment requests before an actual payment is made. This is far more efficient than collecting payments and then paying suppliers in one go.
An additional benefit is that tracing bitcoin transactions becomes significantly harder because a large number of transactions is skipped and never end up in the blockchain.
Now you're reducing the settlement time of multiple transactions in one single transaction. Solutions like these are virtually impossible with existing payment channels. With bitcoin it's easy peasy.

Crypto isn't "broken". It degrades over time. New algorithms are discovered that can aid in brute forcing keys, unravel hashing functions, etc. These things happen slowly, not suddenly. If they do happen, bitcoin's crypto is pluggable and we can switch over to next generation crypto solutions long before the old ones are too weak to use.

Something is considered a soft fork if older clients can still sync and transact, which is the case if this change is made. The only difference is which block miners will consider the top block when a fork occurs.

Oh dear, hours. Have you tried sending fiat? How long did that take? Days? Bitcoin doesn't sound so bad now, does it?


Because it's not a problem.


This is not true. Sending a transaction through the bitcoin network is instant, just like Visa or MasterCard. *Settlement* in bitcoin can take an hour, settlement with Visa and MasterCard takes *months*.
@_date: 2014-12-10 03:33:29


Because it's not an issue. Sending and receiving transactions is instant. *Settlement* takes longer and you choose how many confirmations you are comfortable with before you accept that the transaction isn't going to be reverted or double spent. You could spend an unconfirmed transaction, no problem. The risk in doing so is that your input transaction could be double spent, rendering your transaction invalid, which is why you wait for *settlement* so you are reasonably certain that that won't happen.
Now if you look at the traditional financial services around today, settlement of a transaction can take days to weeks, even months. I'd say 1 hour is pretty damn fast. As for sending a regular transaction and verifying that it's not going to be double spent to a reasonable degree takes a few seconds and requires that you are fairly well connected to the bitcoin network. Propagation through the bitcoin network doesn't take very long and that's exactly what BitPay relies on.


Pretty much all merchants that process through BitPay or Coinbase. And even then, for regular goods that are shipped to you, you really don't care that it takes an hour to fully confirm the transaction. Let the customer know that you received the transaction as soon as you get it and then when it's time to ship the product out you can verify if it wasn't double spent. 


Have you ever tried sending fiat to one of those exchanges? Did your money get there in less then an hour? No? Thought so.

I've been reading the rest of your posts, to get a better understanding of your argument, so do you mind if I try to recap it here to see if we're on the same page?
Your argument is that a side chain will become more popular than bitcoin and therefore miners will want to concentrate their efforts on that side chain instead of bitcoin, which could potentially result in bitcoin becoming less secure / valuable / etc? Is that a fair representation of your viewpoint?
Well, there are a number of arguments I can think of:
* New Bitcoins can only be created on the main chain all the way until 2140. Side chains are limited to transaction fees. You mentioned that in your top post, so any potential move by miners to a side chain is probably going to be gradual.
* Miners trying to block people from moving Bitcoins onto the side chain would be working against their own best interest (less transaction fees to mine), so I wouldn't worry about that part.
* The mining algorithm on the side chain could be different, requiring different hardware. If mining difficulty levels off, then this argument becomes more important since ROI's will be calculated over longer periods of time.
* Bitcoin is the main chain. All side chains hanging off it can only move back and forth between each other through the main chain. It still has a very valuable function in this scenario. It's The One that Binds Them. :)
Another argument is; side chains that become more popular than the bitcoin blockchain apparently offer better functionality / value / whatever. As long as people can move coins from the bitcoin chain onto this new chain, there's no issue. You could see it as a migration path to a 'bitcoin 2.0' successor, where everyone can bring their existing coins along. Wouldn't that be something? :)
Edit: Here's an example. Let's say someone makes an Ethereum side chain that only uses Bitcoin instead of Ether as its coin. It would take some time to harden the Ethereum codebase, but let's assume that it's rock solid. Ethereum offers a lot more functionality than the bitcoin protocol, so I'd personally have no problem with it if that chain became more popular than the bitcoin main chain, to the point that bitcoin could even die off completely. Everyone can move over with the click of a button. No pre mining, no coin auction, just a peg from Bitcoin to the new Side-Ethereum. The main bitcoin chain would probably stay alive for quite some time, since the economic incentive of the miners is the remaining bitcoins and the potential funds that still want to move to the Ethereum side chain. Everybody wins.

The main reason that it hasn't been standardized yet is because the author of BIP 38 bypassed the process for proposing BIP's. There was minimal discussion around his proposal, he allocated the BIP number himself and added it to the wiki himself, all of which is not a great start for a new standard.
It's been added now as a draft (and will probably never move on from there) for the sole reason that it's so popular right now. 
There are several new proposals in the works and some are even already being used (BIP 39 for example) that are far superior to BIP 38. Mostly because they support BIP 32 (Hierarchical Deterministic wallets) and not a single private key.
The only real thing that BIP38 has going for it is the 2 factor generation of the private key, allowing 3rd parties to create wallets without having access to the private key. Although there you still have to trust that the key stored in the wallet is correct (you'd have to order several copies to confirm in one of them that the key is correct).

The value of Bitcoin and the token on a side chain are linked. Either 1:1 or some other knowable conversion, for example if someone were to start a chain with demurrage (like a Freicoin side chain) it would obviously not be 1:1, but still knowable - predictable - beforehand.
Therefore, something that affects the value of Bitcoin on the main chain, also affects the value of the token on any side-chain, since there's no floating conversion.

The "merkle tree" isn't something you can just download. The only thing that's included in a block is the merkle root. 
SPV nodes download merkle branches when they receive a transaction they're potentially interested in. It's an efficient and secure way to determine if a transaction is included in a block.
Just to expand on that a little bit, here's how an SPV wallet works:
The wallet composes a [Bloom filter]( that allows the remote node to filter out the vast majority of transactions that the SPV node isn't interested in. So an SPV node only downloads the block headers, validates them and then receives any transactions in that block that pass through the filter. For privacy reasons, the bloom filter also includes some random noise, so the remote node can't readily figure out which transactions the SPV node is interested in. This becomes more secure if the SPV node doesn't reuse addresses (if you're reusing addresses, then all those transactions pass through the filter, making it more likely that those are the ones you are interested in). 
When the remote node finds a transaction that passes through the filter, it will send it + merkle branch to the SPV wallet. The SPV wallet can then validate the merkle branch and if it checks out, it knows that it was part of the block that it just validated.

That would be the case for 'mass adoption events'. Gradual, organic adoption is another way, one that's currently happening all over the world. The number of bitcoin users is growing, though this is highly distorted by speculators moving in and out from time to time. 
Personally I'm not too worried about bitcoin failing due to external issues. It's clearly better than the alternatives in many ways save for volatility in price. 
Infrastructure is growing at a rapid pace, security is increasing and those that are under performing are called out and shamed into upping their game, etc. 
Really, bitcoin innovation is moving at breakneck speed. I'm surprised at how far we've come the last year. HD wallets are either already out there (mobile is leading the way here) or are set to release real soon (electrum, multibit, armory come to mind). That pretty much solves the backup problems that we were seeing in the past years.
Multi sig is starting to ramp up now too. This will probably see mass deployment in 2015. Hopefully that will take a bite out of theft. 
So all is well on the user end. Clearly companies and wallet developers have focused a lot on this area. I say it's time to move on from there. On to the merchant / payment side of things. More payment protocol support, and hopefully extensions to it, like subscriptions and multi-party transactions (consumer protection services). 
But the most important thing in all of that is collaboration and standardization. Developers really should work together on features like that and publish their work through BIP's. 
That's my hope for 2015.

@_date: 2014-08-07 10:19:39


I'm fully aware of that. And all those issues will be addressed to a certain degree, depending on severity, as they have been in the past. 
The issues you mentioned have already been addressed (maybe not directly in code, but there has been a lot of talk about those subjects and there are broad stroke plans for many of them). 
Scalability has already been thoroughly thought out that it has its own wiki page. Even then; right now the devs are talking about ways to increase initial block propagation speed to make up for the eventual block size increase.
Speed; non-issue. If you are aware of a significant number of nodes when it comes to transaction propagation then you don't really care about 10 minute confirmation windows. That's what BitPay does today. They are connected to a significant number of Bitcoin nodes that they monitor for double-spend attempts. The chance of a double spend attempt successfully pushing out a legit transaction drops considerably in the first few seconds after the initial transaction is broadcast to the network.
The dangers of a 50%+ mining attack has been grossly overstated. Any mining pool that operates over 50% overtly is only hurting itself in the short-term. The true danger currently lies in a mining outfit having control over a large percentage of mining capacity *covertly*. It's not about controlling the tip of the block chain that makes it dangerous for one entity to have that much hashing power, it's being able to reorganize a significant portion of existing blocks. Abusing visible mining power for that is immediately detectable (significant drop in hashing power while the mining pool is generating a parallel chain). 
But again, there are steps being taken to bring some of the control over what goes into a block back to the individual miners and not in the hands of pool operators.


The issues you mentioned aren't even *close* to having a catastrophic effect on bitcoin. If anything, I'd worry more about breakthroughs in crypto (discrete log optimizations) than any of the problems you mentioned so far.


As I said earlier, even if something better comes along (like IPv6 vs IPv4), it would have to be so significantly better in order to unseat Bitcoin as the market leader that I just don't see it happening anytime soon. 
I'm not trying to be smug or ignorant of other systems (which is why I mentioned Ethereum); it really will take a system that's several times better at solving the problem that Bitcoin is trying to solve before it will have the chance to unseat Bitcoin as the market leader.

I don't think we'll ever see 'hyperbitcoinization'. Even if that were to happen, we'll see a mix of different solutions, some of them being run by companies (change tip, etc), others could very well be side chains, or whatever new developments come out over the years, and bitcoin proper.
Just to highlight one of them, BitPay, I don't think that they will be as critical to bitcoin's sustained success as they currently are. Sure, they'll be around for quite some time, but when more and more companies start to "close the loop" all they are really offering is an extra layer of double spend protection. That's something that a lot more companies / open source projects will be able to offer than the interface to the existing financial system that BitPay offers today. 
In a world where transitions to and from bitcoin become less frequent, the problems will become more technical in nature and therefore easier to solve.

Microsoft, at one point the biggest tech company on the planet takes this fledgling little payment system seriously over a plethora of other more mature systems out there. What's their reasoning behind that? That last part is what makes it interesting to me. They've got to be pretty damn compelling reasons for them to make this move. 
Not only that, but Bitcoin's image in the mainstream press has taken quite a beating. For Microsoft to associate itself with it is quite the statement.
It can also be a good indicator how other big companies feel about bitcoin but are either still observing or don't want to be the first to move. And then there's the competitiveness. "Microsoft moved, now we kind of have to too." 
And now it's a foot in the door.

I understand your arguments, they're just not very good. 
It's not a straightforward as you think. If merchants save money by accepting bitcoin, both through transaction costs (BitPay now offers a 0% package for example) and fraud reduction (no chargebacks), then they will forward some of those savings on to the consumer. This is a financial incentive for the consumer to start using bitcoin. We've seen this with many merchants out there already. Newegg offering 10% discount when paying with bitcoin, tiger direct offering $20 discount on any order over $100, etc, etc. Reduction of cost on the merchant side will result in cost reduction for the consumer which will lead to financial incentive for them to use bitcoin. Simple as that.


Not really. There are 2 of 3 solutions in the works (granted, they're rare and are still in active development) that will offer payment dispute resolution, which is exactly what chargebacks should be for (as opposed to reversing fraudulent payments). These services are optional and will be competitive (as opposed to being baked into the payment solution, which is the case with credit cards), which will result in cheaper dispute resolution solutions than what we see no with CC's. 


You're the one footing this bill, so I would think you'd be interested in that. As stated earlier: merchant cost reduction will lead to reduced prices for consumers. That's simply a fact. Merchants compete for customers and the number one way to do that is by lowering prices. When the payment solution is optimized to cost almost nothing, then that gives them a competitive advantage.

No, your balance will not slowly increase. Having said that, when bitcoin settles into its deflationary pattern (this is going to take quite some time), your purchasing power will increase steadily over time as coins are lost, more people use it, etc. 
@_date: 2014-08-15 08:15:50


Simple and easy aren't the first things that come to mind when I think of Blockchain.info. 
Let's have a look what you need to do to get optimal security:
- You need an identifier. You can give this identifier a name to remember it more easily. If you lose this number and you haven't connected your email address to your wallet, then you lose your coins.
- You need two passwords. One to log into blockchain.info and the other to decrypt your wallet. Blockchain.info can help you if you forget the first one, but you're screwed if you forget the second one. Also, best set that second password BEFORE you enable backups or you will have old wallet addresses backups floating around with unencrypted keys.
- You will want to set up 2 factor authentication. This is a no brainer considering the huge number of posts we get here from people that have had their wallets drained. If you lose your 2FA key, you need to contact blockchain.info to get access again.
- Enable backups of your wallet. Every time you create a new address, or if you change anything like a label, or add a watch only address, then you receive a fresh back up. Cool. Except for the fact that this backup is now also a target. So you need 2FA on your email. 
- You can restrict access to your wallet to certain IP's. That's nice, but also sucks if you lose access to that IP address (say your ISP issues you a new IP).
- Any new computer needs to be verified (through email. did you remember to set that up)?
- On mobile you also need a PIN number. Don't forget this number!
- When sending coins on mobile, you can also send from your watch only addresses. Oh, no, wait. error. Wait, huh?
There are literally dozens of things that could go wrong here. 
And yet it's still the most popular wallet. Heck, I prefer it over others.
But as you can see, there's a LOT that can be improved. 
For iOS, for example. I hope that devs start using the iCloud key chain. And Touch ID (and the whole secure computing thing that comes with it so nefarious tasks can't snoop memory while the private keys are exposed in memory). That takes care of back-ups and security in one go. No more 2FA, no more email back ups, passwords, pins, etc, etc. 
I hope that the payment protocol becomes more prevalent. And that payment request are signed by default (and clients error out if that's not the case). I don't want to see an address ever again.
I want an easy way to send a payment request to one of my friends either through ad-hoc networking, through other kinds of standard messaging channels or iBeacons, whatever.

Apple is obsessive when it comes to user experience. Bitcoin still fails in several major areas.
Right now, bitcoin doesn't offer the perfect user experience yet. That would require the payment protocol for proof of payment, 100% certainty that a payment will make it into the blockchain (would require something like parent pays fee for child) and 100% certainty that the wallet won't be hacked (would require a hardware wallet solution).
That, on top of the regulatory uncertainty that still exists, plus the pain of getting your hands on bitcoins and the price volatility are the major roadblocks for getting a bitcoin wallet onto iOS.

Copy / paste of an answer I gave -Mahn:
Speed; non-issue. If you are aware of a significant number of nodes when it comes to transaction propagation then you don't really care about 10 minute confirmation windows. That's what BitPay does today. They are connected to a significant number of Bitcoin nodes that they monitor for double-spend attempts. The chance of a double spend attempt successfully pushing out a legit transaction drops considerably in the first few seconds after the initial transaction is broadcast to the network.


Same thing goes for any stock IPO in history. Because those people saw the potential early on and took the risk when Bitcoin was still young and still had a long way to go.

To point out the obvious to people reading this:
I'm assuming your dad is financially stable and is only investing money he can afford to lose. In that case, this totally makes sense.
Having 1 bitcoin bought at $800 means that he's $400 under water. It would have to rise back up to $800 again for him to break even. If he bought another 3 at $400, then (1 * $800 + 3 * $400) / 4 = $500. Even though your dad now has increased his exposure by having $2000 invested, he now only has to hit $500 to break even again. A far more achievable goal than $800.

No. They develop the side chain technology open source, but they are not the ones doing the actual mining or the ones that bootstrap the side chains or even the ones that determine which side chains are supported by miners. That's up to the miners to decide. 
Second, there's no rule enforcing that a side chain is merge-mined. It can be a stand-alone chain that supports two way pegging. 


This is true for chains with a different asset, like Litecoin and Dogecoin, etc, however we haven't seen an instance of a second blockchain carrying the same asset as is possible with side chains. At that point the differentiating factor is only the added rules on the side chain. Not another asset. There is no way you can make the assertion that "only one blockchain will be bestowed the network effects necessary for establishing the critical mass of security and adoption". 


This has to be the most pure form of concern trolling that I have ever witnessed in this subreddit.


More FUD.


Because side chains don't exist yet. When they do, wallets will eventually be upgraded to support them.


Side chains are still in the design stage. The weakness that you describe (related to the SPV proofs) is *obviously* a hot topic for debate. There's no reason to believe that this issue won't be addressed before the first side chain is rolled out.

I think that that makes it unnecessarily complex. A round robin system would be more efficientl than this. The only thing they'd take from bitcoin would be signing transactions. They wouldn't need the scripting system since they only deal with money. maybe they could add a currency unit, message field, etc, but other than that there's not much that would be useful. Also, linking back to old transactions doesn't make much sense since they're constantly moving money into and out of that system. 
But to be honest, I haven't thought about it too much. Mostly because when you're already centralized (or pseudo centralized) then most of what bitcoin has to offer becomes burdensome.
@_date: 2014-12-01 00:45:20
Bitcoin is best compared to a scarce resource like gold, except it has better properties than gold. 
It is absolutely scarce, 21M bitcoin will ever exist and no more, unlike gold that could in the far future be mined from asteroids. 
Bitcoin is also far easier to divide and merge than gold. 
Bitcoin is impossible to counterfeit, which can't be said for gold. There are numerous counterfeit gold coins and even tungsten filled gold bars have been found in the wild. On top of that, gold has different levels of purity. A bitcoin is always the same, never diluted and if you receive one, it's easily verified on the blockchain if it's real or not.
Bitcoin is also far easier to store / secure / send than gold.

I understand, but it ties in to other parts of the system as well; network bandwidth, cpu speeds, memory sizes. All of these have reasonable predictable growth curves and they are all closely related to Moore's law. If the Bitcoin block size can outpace that, then you are going to hit those limits. So maybe something similar to, perhaps a bit higher, but still way less than 4x per month is probably more sustainable.

2 of 3 transactions allow for consumer protection, where the customer, merchant and an independent third party hold one key each. If something goes wrong (merchant does not deliver) then the customer and the third party sign the transaction and the money goes back to the user. if everything goes right, the customer and merchant sign the transaction and the money goes to the merchant. If the user doesn't want to deal with all the fuss, then the merchant and third party sign and the merchant gets the money. At no point can the third party run away with the money.
Anyway, you probably don't need this kind of protection for the vast majority of your purchases, depending on what kind of companies you do business with.

The payment from customer to merchant would always happen, that's the only place where a transaction fee is paid. All other transactions in the chain are eliminated. 
This is not really an accounting nightmare. Rolling credit payoffs already exist today, the only difference being that they are now automatically forwarded from customer to supplier. Where the bitcoins go isn't that important, if it's their own wallet or one of their suppliers, etc, they would still go on the books as income.

"You don't understand it if you can't build it." That's what someone once said and I consider that true. So I wrote my own Bitcoin client to learn the details of the system. 
I learned a lot from that exercise and I don't claim to know everything about Bitcoin or the new developments that are currently in the works, but I'm fairly certain I understand the fundamentals thoroughly .
Having said that, those panic threads that pop up from time to time about scalability, 51% attacks, or whatever the threat of the week is just seem so comical. People hear a term and extrapolate into lala land from there. And when you try to explain to them that it's a non-issue or at the very least a highly unlikely credible threat to bitcoin's survival, you're accused of being dismissive and "Bitcoin folks don't take criticism seriously". 
So to anyone concerned about any technical issues in Bitcoin, EDUCATE YOURSELF before freaking out and scaring the living shit out of the newbies.

Let's see if we can rewrite some of your arguments. Emphasis mine:




See? Works for altcoins too. Actually with an altcoin, they would have control over issuance as well, which wouldn't be the case with a sidechain since sidechains depend on the bitcoin ledger for fund injection. They *could* add their own alt coin to that ledger, but you'd be dealing with two separate assets on one chain, which would be quite burdensome.


Special permission to access Bitcoin? Really? 


The 'special permission' you are referring to above would apply here as well, regardless if a government would create an alt or a sidechain or whatever. They already have a coin, in the US it's called the Dollar and it's already heavily regulated and restricted. And if they wanted to try out blockchain technology, then they could have bootstrapped an alt. Sidechains don't really offer that many advantages over alts other than the 1:1 peg with Bitcoin, which, again, would be a 'bad thing' for goverments that want to control issuance.


Exactly, including and probably *especially* issuance.

The problem is you're including a lot of noise. It's like looking at all transactions world wide, including every bet made in every casino world wide. Those transactions are relevant only when you sum them up (which happens when the casino's report their earnings) or when bitcoin betting sites move their profits to other wallets.

There are several pieces in the bitcoin network that deal with double spends.
The first one is transaction propagation through the network. Every transaction received by a node is validated and if it clears that validation, it's added to the mempool of unconfirmed transactions and then offered to all connected nodes so it propagates through the network.
If an incoming transaction conflicts with a transaction already in the mempool, it is rejected and the sender of that transaction is notified with a reject message. The double spend transaction is not propagated.
But ultimately it comes down to whichever transaction ends up in a block in the blockchain. That's bitcoin's global ledger and is considered the "ultimate truth" when it comes to transactions in the bitcoin network.
@_date: 2014-02-10 11:03:35
It's a non-issue. At least, for properly written wallets. The transaction stays exactly the same (same amounts, same addresses, etc), the only difference is that the encoding can be changed, resulting in a different hash for the transaction. If the wallet software can't deal with something like that (like the one MtGox uses), then there's a problem. For most other wallets (Bitcoin-Qt, etc) the user won't even notice the transaction hash changed.
Edit: In fact, the Blockchain.info iPhone app encodes badly formed signatures and the website actually corrects them before sending them out onto the bitcoin network. So almost every transaction sent with the iPhone app is altered. And nobody cares. That's how 'big' the issue is.

Other than price, I think that deeper order books are more important. Having the price hover between $300 and $400 doesn't mean much if any whale can push the price in any direction at will.

This is based on a conversation with the developer, i haven't verified this in code myself (which i'm still planning on doing) and on my rudimentary understanding of Apple's security model (which I'm going to spend some time researching soon):
The wallet seed (where all your addresses are generated from) is stored encrypted in the keychain. It is marked as device only, so it's not backed up to iCloud or in the iCloud keychain. It's only accessible by the Breadwallet app, no other apps can access it.
Since it's in the keychain, if you delete the app and then install it again, the seed will still be there. 
Decryption is done by the Secure Element, a cryptographic chip that resides inside Apple's processors. 
Generally this is pretty safe. There are some caveats though. Other apps can't access it, but that's due to Apple's software stack, not something that's enforced by hardware. There's always a chance that a malicious app finds a way to access the encrypted seed anyway, but it's still encrypted at that point.
When the seed is decrypted, it resides in memory. Apps run in protected memory spaces, which should mean it's walled off from other apps. This is partially enforced by hardware, but there's always the possibility that some software finds a way around this.
Overall I still think this is the best security you can get on an iPhone or any mobile device for that matter. 
Again, I could be wrong about some things above, but I think the general gist of it is correct. If anybody knows more about this, please correct me.
Edit: One thing that could be done (and maybe this already happens, or is / isn't possible) is a cryptographic critical section. That basically means that the entire system freezes, nothing executes except for the critical code section in the app that's dealing with sensitive information. The idea is basically that a critical section is started, the app then decrypts the seed, does all it has to do with it (sign transactions, messages, etc) and then wipes the sensitive information from memory before leaving the critical section. This makes it practically impossible for malicious apps to steal the decrypted keys but it relies on two things: whether or not critical sections actually exist in Apples chips / OS (I don't know, I haven't had the time to find out) and the wallet developer implements it properly (doesn't forget to wipe all sensitive info).

The relay fee is not really a fee. It's a threshold to determine if a transaction is going to be relayed across the network. This threshold is there to stop transaction spam. 
It used to be equal to the fee to get into a block, which means that mining pools that want to include transactions with a lower fee than is standard can't really do that since those transactions are dropped by the network. 
Now that the relay fee (threshold) is 10x lower than the default transaction fee, there's room for miners to compete on transaction fees.
Also, if there's a client with a fee calculation bug, that would usually result in the transaction being dropped. Now that's no longer the case and chances are it'll end up in a block.

The blockchain only makes sense if you are trying to make a public ledger that no single party has control over. Any other system would make more sense than a blockchain if it was a single party, a consortium of parties, etc. 
Blockchain technology is incredibly wasteful due to the proof of work that's required to make it resistant against attacks (let's ignore proof of stake systems for the sake of argument). 
Because of that, you need incentives for parties to support that network. Now, you can try to do that externally to the blockchain, through payments, but that introduces a 3rd party, contracts, and a constraint on the amount of computational power that can be applied to protect the network. The party(ies) that are trying to have the system secured by pumping money in are basically adding an external factor to the system that they could just do themselves more cheaply.
So that brings you back to the (semi) centralized solution. Why spend so much money on hardware for proof of work just to secure the system when you could just as easily use signatures to declare which blocks are valid?
So in order to truly make the system decentralized, everything that supports it has to be internal to the system. The incentives have to be paid out by the system itself. And that introduces the digital asset.

I agree on everything that you said so far, save for this part. Currently you have to confirm every OUTPUT of a transaction you're trying to send to (which is usually just one, unless you're building up a multi-output transaction), minus the change address (Trezor knows this one, so it doesn't ask about it). If BIP70 comes out, then all of that goes away, since it's cryptographically certain that the outputs aren't tampered with. So all the device would say [Certificate issuer, big checkmark or thumbs up] "&lt;Insert whatever the transaction request message is here&gt;" Send? [Yes] [No].
A lot cleaner. Mind you, I have no idea how they're going to implement it, but that could be how they do it.
Like I said, Trezor isn't perfect, far from it, and you're right that it's probably not something I'd want my mom to use, but I'm not sure how you'd improve on this. But go ahead and prove me wrong though! :)

Because those coins disappear when a reorganization happens. coin base coins are unique to a specific block. If you replace that block, they're gone. So to avoid that risk, coin base coins have to be 100 blocks old before they're considered spendable. The chance of a reorganization that deep from occurring is incredibly small. If it were to occur, there's something far worse going on on the bitcoin network.

Private keys aren't generated with poorly created R-values.
The problem comes up when you produce multiple signatures with the same private key (like when you redeem multiple transaction outputs to the same address) and the R values have low entropy between them. At that point it's possible to figure out the private key in a reasonable timeframe.
Edit: or if you pick a really poor R value that can be guessed fairly easily. In that case a single transaction would expose the private key.

I've been thinking about this for a while, since I saw this post here yesterday and I think that having high fees is not a good thing. 
Hear me out. 
For remittance, a BTM is an ideal point of sale and right now the total fees on both sides of moving money through bitcoin BTM's means that it is nowhere near competitive as compared to the likes of Western Union, MoneyGram, etc. I think that's a sad state of affairs. 
So I think that just running BTM's is probably not a very good business model even with the convenience argument. Instead, I think that BTM's should be run by Bitcoin companies that have other services that are their primary revenue source and simply have the BTM's around as [loss leaders]( That way you are stimulating the use of bitcoin, especially since you now offer a cheap cash -&gt; bitcoin -&gt; cash option for the unbanked. 
Simply put, the BTM is your business card. It's a way to familiarize people with Bitcoin, with your company, and is a way to expose people to your other services. Individual users simply isn't were the money is (revenue stream for you). Look at Circle for example. They allow users to buy Bitcoin and sell bitcoin for market price. Withdraw Bitcoin with no fee (not even the transaction fee), etc. They're building out other products that will become their source of revenue. 
Buying and selling bitcoin simply isn't where you want to collect a fee.
Tl;dr: Make the ins and outs as cheap as possible so and expose people to your other services.

You'd also be able to send your bitcoin to anyone, anywhere, at any time, for a few pennies, if that. 
When receiving bitcoin, you wouldn't have to worry about any fraud like with [credit cards](
On top of that, bitcoin has what is called "user definable privacy". You can go from completely anonymous to fully transparent and anywhere in between. It's your choice. 
When someone sends you bitcoin, you can wait for any number of confirmations before you consider the payment settled. With credit cards and some other types of bank transfers, this can take weeks, sometimes even months before you can consider the money yours. With bitcoin, 6 confirmations would take an hour on average and you can be pretty damn certain that the bitcoins are yours.
You can spend the incoming bitcoins as soon as you receive them (just beware of the confirmations, if you spend them right away, then there's a risk that the transaction could become invalid).

**Ok, let's assume that Bitcoin reaches market saturation.**
There are only so many bitcoin and even though the price rised considerably with every wave of new users, eventually it will have reached a point where this increase in users will have less of an effect on the price. 
But it works both ways. Bigger markets are harder to influence. The price will settle down and will most likely increase slowly in value, somewhere around the rate of inflation of most currencies, maybe a little more given a rising world population and bitcoin lost over time.

There are other ways to encourage decentralization, for example by requiring miners to 'buy in' to a side chain before being allowed to mine there and requiring each block to be signed by the key that holds the buy in funds. Should a miner play foul, those funds could be frozen.
And now that all blocks are signed by a fund holding key, restrictions could be placed on the number of (consecutive or percentage of X) blocks mined with that key. 
A rogue miner could still buy in several times and be able to get 50+%, but at considerable cost and with the risk of losing funds in the process.  Furthermore, restrictions could be placed on withdrawals by miners, making it even harder to cheat the side chain. The end result being that you end up with a situation where long term participation is the most profitable option.
Currently a lot of the blocks generated by miners are already being tagged so that people know where they came from. It wouldn't surprise me if that ended up happening on a side chain as well, which would give users a clear picture of who owns which fund holding miner keys.

The sunk cost fallacy does not apply to investment in an asset that can be reasonably expected to yield a return. It applies to investments that cannot be recovered, like time / money invested in development of a product, when marketed /sold will never cover that cost, or the cost of a meal, cost of movie tickets, etc. 
What I described is dollar cost averaging, or at least the logic behind trying to lower the ROI threshold. 
Your argument doesn't hold up because it assumes that bitcoin can *never* reach $500 (in my case) or $800 (in the initial case) ever again, which is clearly an incorrect assumption. 
Edit: In fact, if you were to assume that your argument is correct, then an investor is required to walk away from any investment that went down in price (sunk cost!) and is only allowed to invest in an investment that is moving upward (surely it will go up more!). That doesn't make any sense, does it?
@_date: 2014-11-23 22:21:47
I disagree. If a miner goes rogue and starts imposing its own rules then the natural response of the bitcoin economy is to tell them that they can go fuck themselves, regardless of what change they're trying to make. If there's something that's in no short supply around here, it's hostility. :)
It is not a "known risk". It is a "known non-risk".
Edit: You know what would happen? We'd see a drop in hash rate and an invalid block every now and then. Invalid blocks aren't propagated through the network, so the chance of actually receiving one is very slim. A single miner, regardless of the amount of hashing power he controls is completely powerless to make changes to the protocol all by himself.

There are still issues with side chains that have to be resolved, one of them incentives. There is no mining subsidy in a side chain, coins can only be created by pegging a bitcoin transaction to it, thus creating coins. When moving coins back into bitcoin (basically redeeming a previously suspended / pegged bitcoin transaction), they are destroyed in the side chain. The only incentive to mine a side chain is transaction fees.

An attack like that is very noticeable. You'd see a significant drop in hashing power on the network when someone is preparing an alternate chain. 


 Spawning a couple thousand nodes to get cheap votes is easy enough. It would be far easier to attack the network than having to gather &gt; 50% hashing power.

Segwit fixes malleability because it moves the data that could be changed by 3^rd parties out of the transaction into its own structure called the witness data. Changing the witness data no longer changes the transaction ID. That's one part. 
The second part is, the block size of 1MB is basically removed and instead data is "weighted". A total of 4.000.000 is allowed, where regular transaction bytes are counted as 4 bytes and witness bytes are counted as 1 byte. So that means that all witness data gets a discount of 75%. 
Witness blocks can reach higher than 1MB in total data due to the discount on witness data. When regular non-segwit nodes request the block, they receive just the non-witness parts of the block, which will always be less than the current block size of 1MB and the segwit inputs will always succeed their script evaluation (this is similar to other soft forks). 
So non-segwit nodes can still validate everything about all transactions, such as if they are trying to spend coins that were already spent, or if they are trying to create coins out of thin air, etc, with the exception of validating the redemption scripts in segwit transactions. They are assumed valid by old nodes, basically reducing them down to SPV level security for these specific transactions. 
If node operators want to remain fully validating nodes, they'll have to upgrade to a segwit enabled node, but only if they care about validating witness scripts.  
So a segwit node always receives the full block data, including the witness data, which can be *more* than 1MB.

BIP70 is the next thing they're going to add after they're done with multsig, so that doesn't matter much. 
Recovery, agreed. It does lower the security when restoring a wallet, but I'd still consider it fairly secure.


Really? Because other than entering a PIN and pressing OK, I don't really see how they could simplify the workflow. The website that they have today is their first wallet, and Electrum, Multibit and even Armory are adding Trezor support.


Totally agree, I think that Trezor is an intermediate step to better hardware wallets. Having said that, I think that we're going to see the same trend we saw with GPS units, MP3 players and Camera's. They're all going to be integrated into our phones. Apple's hardware for example, is already very close to what you'd need to create a very secure wallet. Their secure element is an excellent key store. It wouldn't be too hard to beef that up to support bitcoin transaction signing and BIP70. In fact, I think it already does some of those things for Apple Pay.
Still interested in seeing what you guys come up with though. Are you also open sourcing the hardware side?

If there was a fixed exchange of $1 = 1 Bitcoin, then that would mean there has to be someone out there that guarantees 100% to deliver on that promise. That would introduce a 3^rd party into the equation, exactly one of the things that Bitcoin is trying to get away from. 
Currently the price floats, which means that the free market determines the price through supply vs demand. This results in volatility when the liquidity is low, but eliminates the need for a 3^rd party backer. A far better situation to be in in the long term.
@_date: 2017-02-21 23:56:08


Orphaning and rejection are quite different things. Orphaning happens when valid blocks are not selected to be extended and rejection happens when the network does not accept the blocks because it breaks consensus rules. No amount of extension by miners that are willing to break consensus will make this block any more valid to validating full nodes. 


No there is no setting aside a crucial aspect of the Bitcoin network's enforcement of consensus rules. The block would remain invalid even if a majority of hash power was to extend it. Miners that do not accept these blocks will not extend them and will continue to mine on the valid chain. So even if BU gains 51% hashing majority, the Bitcoin network will continue on with 49% and will categorically reject the blocks produced by the 51% hashing majority.


Yes, it does. On your part.


If that's what you want to call it, fine by me.


Mostly logic and a good understanding of the distribution of power in the bitcoin network. 


It is you that is misguided in thinking that miners hold any power here. They are allowed by the Bitcoin network to mine blocks and earn a living under the provision that they stick to the rules agreed upon and when they break them they cease to earn money. No amount of coercion on their part will force other network participants to accept their blocks as valid.

The transaction ID is the hash of the transaction. Since some data inside current transactions can be changed without invalidating it, that can change the transaction ID. This is called the malleability problem. Segwit fixes this for the most obvious case (where 3^rd parties try to change the transaction and thus the transaction ID).

All of OPs claims can be dismissed for one simple reason: Sidechains don't exist yet. Until we see the first implementation, there's nothing you can assume about any of it. You can't assume that the coin needs to be merge mined, you can't assume that it causes any kind of centralization, you can't assume the crazy notion that it will require KYC/AML to operate on a sidechain, you can't assume that goverments will want to move in and take over a sidechain, you can't assume that a sidechain will become more popular than Bitcoin, you can't assume anything until there's actually an implementation up and running for people to investigate and criticize. 
The paper describes a way to implement sidechains, the advantages of having sidechains, etc. It also identifies a number of potential weaknesses and some ways to address them. And now there's discussion on those weaknesses and the solutions and if there are other, possibly better solutions to address those weaknesses, etc. It's still a work in progress. 
But OP goes of on a rant that takes us off into lala land on a bullet train about centralization, governments, KYC/AML requirements, etc. It's ridiculous. And then we have to actually address his 'concerns' because they're 'legit'? Give me a break.

The thing is, with bitcoin you can actually reach 100% certainty that the wallet is unhackable in every day use. Granted, with the proper tools to disassemble a chip to inspect the silicon, you could still get at the keys, but short of that, a hardware solution can be 100% secure.
The bitcoin network already guarantees 100% uptime, short of catastrophic internet failure.

With deterministic I mean that you can't tell if a node has already received transaction A (the one you're trying to double spend against) when you are trying to send it transaction B. It could have received it from another node it's connected to.
When you ignore RBF flagged transactions, then I can tell that your node will be happy to receive a regular transaction that double spends against an RBF transaction. 
With the above I assume you're simply going to drop all RBF transactions. If you were to revert back to first-seen, then yes. It will work like it did before.

No, that's not how it works at all. There is no relationship between what was ordered and where the payment goes.

All the supplier sees is: merchant X just paid off $Y of his credit. 
The incentive to do this is quite obvious: moving money costs both time and money. Reducing the number of movements (and therefore the required time and fees) is beneficial to every one involved.

RBF has been in development for quite some time. It was proposed and developed by [David A. Harding and Peter Todd](
SegWit has been deployed in the Alpha side chain on TestNet since May 2015 and a soft fork adaptation is currently being tested on a dedicated test net named SegNet. Segwit will make use of the available 1MB more efficient by moving the witness data out of the transaction and into a secondary buffer, bringing the total of the two to a max of 4MB. Since it's a soft fork, the rollout is much faster than a hard fork and will therefore bring extra capacity much faster. You can see which wallets intend to support it and how far along they are [here](

Sidechains are not a scaling solution. Both miners and full nodes will have to download both the Bitcoin blockchain and the sidechain blocks in order to fully validate them and that actually makes it a worse solution than simply increasing the block size of Bitcoin itself.

I don't think so. I've gone though Bread wallet's code a bit, but it doesn't look like it supports BIP 44 (Again, I could be wrong). If it doesn't support BIP 44, it's most likely using a custom setup to generate addresses. A BIP 44 wallet won't find those used addresses when scanning the blockchain.

No. This is was because people were running old code on testnet. This is a unique issue to testnet since code running there is still in flux. Making consensus breaking changes on testnet is fine.

Actually, as I mentioned in another comment, if BIP70 could be extended to allow the merchant to include a specific transaction input in the customers' payment, then you could prevent double payments, since any following payments would become actual double spends. That input could be a 0 btc input for example. There has also been some discussion about allowing merchants to pay the transaction fee, but I'm not entirely sure where that discussion went. One thing I remember about that is that it could lead to people exploiting it to harvest these fees from merchant websites. Even if that part wouldn't work, then being able to prevent double payments with 0btc inputs could be a valid use case.

The point of signing a transaction, a new one that tries to forward funds that are assigned to addresses that you hold the private keys for, is to prove that you actually have the private keys to those addresses. Cryptographic proof of ownership. Everyone on the network can verify the signature and see that you indeed own the private keys to those addresses. 
A second thing is that the signature incorporates the transaction. So the signature is only valid in context of this specific transaction. This accomplishes two things:
- It makes the transaction tamper proof. Nobody can change the content of the transaction or else the signature is invalid and the transaction is rejected.
- You can't copy the signature and slap it into a different transaction. Since it won't validate.
So now that you've proven that you hold the private keys, you are able to assign the input values of those transactions to new outputs. Those outputs will contain different addresses. Some of them could be for a merchant you're trying to send bitcoin to, and others could be your own, because you want the change bitcoins to go back into your own wallet.

If you only expose the regular bitcoin addesses (the ones that start with 1 or 3) then no. There is no way to associate them based solely on that. As soon as you start sending transactions and start combining multiple inputs from multiple addresses, then that does associate them, but that's true for all bitcoin addresses, regardless of how the were generated.
Having said that, there is a feature of HD wallets that allows you to export public addresses of entire sub branches. These are called 'xpub' addresses. These will let you generate many addresses and all of those would obviously be associated. As long as you don't use any of these, you're fine.

You really shouldn't do this. It's probably a lot safer to use an offline wallet to test your private keys while importing. A heavy handed way is to use Armory (though other wallets that allow importing keys probably work similar) that will show you the public address to confirm that you want to import the private key. That's where you can confirm it works and then just hit cancel.

As said, BIP 70 solves all of this. It gives the user a signed payment request that includes the address where the funds should be sent. This means that the address itself can be completely hidden from view (which is where we should be going anyway). The amount is also included in the payment request, so there's no need for the user to enter anything into their wallet app manually. This pretty much eliminates any chance of user error. 
On top of that, the user now has a signed payment request and together with his sent transaction (in the blockchain), he now has cryptographic proof of payment. 
The spec also supports sending a refund address to the merchant, so should something go wrong, the merchant can send the payment back to the customer, without any need for further communication. 


What you're referring to is payment arbitration. This is done using 2-of-3 multi-sig. The customer sends a payment to a 2-of-3 address, where the customer, merchant and an independent 3^rd party (arbitrator) all hold one of the keys. On top of that, a 2^nd, time locked transaction can be generated that sends the funds to the merchant. 
So now you have the following functionality:
If the customer files a dispute (with proof) with the arbitrator, and he agrees with the customer, they can construct a transaction that will send the funds back to the customer (possibly with a small fee for the arbitrator).
If the merchant provides proof to the arbitrator that goods were delivered, the arbitrator and the merchant can construct a transaction (again, with a small fee for the arbitrator) that sends the funds to the merchant.
Merchant and customer can also choose to construct a transaction together, should the arbitrator disappear (or demands a higher fee, etc).
Should any two parties no longer be able to sign, the funds will automatically go to the merchant (time locked transaction). 
I haven't seen any developments in this area yet, but I'm sure people are working on this. I really hope that whoever is working on this will write up BIP's, so we end up with a standard way of implementing this. 
Also, when we do, I hope we end up with a free market for transaction arbitration, where the only two metrics we have to care about is trustworthiness of the arbitrator and fees.

I doubt this will ever happen. I'm not even sure how you would enforce it. 


Even if you were to introduce a new address format, there's still not really a way to prevent a faulty implementation from sending coins to that address. 
That's the inherent problem of an open network. You can break pretty much every rule of every system built on top of it as long as you adhere to the rules of the underlying network. 
The payment protocol runs completely separate from the bitcoin network. The network can't force you to adhere to the payment protocol's rules. 
The same thing goes for addresses. The bitcoin network doesn't really know what a bitcoin address is. All it does is run a script that compares a value to a double hashed (SHA256 + RIPEMD160) value. The fact that we treat those values as addresses lives outside of the bitcoin network. If you were to encode a timeout value into the address, that value would be dropped when it reaches the network layer and thus can't be enforced. Even if you were to add support in bitcoin itself through a hard fork, it could actually invalidate previously valid transactions in a reorganisation.

@_date: 2015-01-25 02:36:09
Bitcoin only has to handle the traffic that's currently being generated. Anything higher isn't even tapped into. Imagine that the max block size was 2MB right now. The storage requirements for the blockchain would look exactly the same as they do today. When the 20MB / max block size is introduced, blocks won't automagically be 20MB a piece. 
Even if there were that much traffic, Bitcoin today, without the cap could easily handle higher volumes of data. The reason that it's not increased yet is that there are a number of optimizations that can be done to reduce the amount of traffic, to make Bitcoin scale even better.
There's no rush to lift the cap. It'll happen in due time.

A possibility is to change the consensus rules as to which chain has the most work behind it. Currently the rule is the highest accumulated difficulty, but that could be amended with other requirements, such as bitcoin days destroyed so an attacker can't recycle his own transactions and ignore those of others. Obviously that would require all miners to upgrade (which most of them will readily do if their blocks aren't included by the attacker).
Edit: If the attacker manages to stay ahead of the other miners, then more users will have to upgrade in order to ignore the 'evil' fork.

Lies. Lightning is an [open protocol]( developed by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja, neither of which work for Blockstream.
There are many different implementations of Lightning, only one of which is from Blockstream:
Go implementation in the works [here](
C implementation in the works [here]( 
Scala implementation in the works [here](
Java implementation in the works [here](
Python implementation in the works [here](  
@_date: 2016-03-03 20:36:10
That doesn't solve the problem though. The problem exists at the miner and full node level. The propagation issue and orphan rate is just as much affected by having two separate chains. 
Sure, you have one use case that benefits by only downloading the pay-coin chain, but it isn't addressing the core issue: block chains can't handle high volume loads. This is a reality that has to be dealt with. Lightning is a good start as it extracts a lot of transactions out of the chain without compromising security. It's not perfect, but with time and advances in Bitcoin's scripting system, we can make it better. It's a fundamental improvement versus just chopping up the current chain into separate pieces. Lightning localizes the load between nodes instead of making it global, which means nobody is affected by a few high traffic nodes interacting with each other.


Exactly, which is why I said that it isn't a scaling solution. Side chains offer nice advantages like being able to run different rules and scripting systems (see elements), but scaling isn't one of the problems it's trying to solve. 
@_date: 2016-03-03 08:27:03
The Lightning Network is a network of payment channels on steroids. All channel open and close events are settled on the Bitcoin blockchain, but the intermediate transactions are only updated between the two peers that are connected to each other. The steroid part comes in when someone wants to pay someone else that they're not directly connected to. In that case, a channel from, say A to B is updated and then B to C, making it look like A paid C. 
This whole setup has several advantages. First, it lowers the number of transactions needed on the blockchain, since only the opens and closes are handled there. Second, there is no chance of double spending since both parties in the channel need to sign the intermediate transaction, making payments instant. Third, when moving through multiple nodes on the network, there is no direct payment link visible on the blockchain from person A to person C (or D, or E, or F, etc). Lastly, since so many transactions never appear on the chain, the fees are significantly less (if any) than regular Bitcoin transactions (bitcoin fees still apply to open / close on-chain). 
Lightning is still in development. There are several implementations being worked on that are all intending to be 100% compatible with each other:
Go implementation in the works [here](
C implementation in the works [here]( 
Scala implementation in the works [here](
Java implementation in the works [here](
Python implementation in the works [here](

Agreed. I did the same thing but in C It gives you an incredible amount of insight in how Bitcoin works because you have to implement every tiny detail. All the crypto, the transaction verification, the script engine, all other consensus rules, difficulty calculations, the works. I'd argue that writing a node, be it a full node or an SPV node is probably the fastest way to learn the Bitcoin protocol.
Edit: I'm willing to even go one step further and say that if you want to become an expert in Bitcoin, writing a node from scratch is pretty much a mandatory exercise.

This does not refer to separate transactions. A transaction that does not have its witness data is considered invalid and will not be included into a block. 
This refers to requesting transaction data from an existing block, where witness data  can be omitted if the receiver is not interested in validating it. 
Edit: to expand a little on this, currently all SPV clients do not validate input scripts (witness data), but are forced to download it because it is part of the transaction. Making this optional means that all SPV clients will need to download less data than before.

Highly unlikely. A two way peg between Bitcoin and a side chain means that you can never move more coins back from a side chain into the Bitcoin blockchain. In reality, you're actually claiming locked transactions (transactions that 'moved' into the side chain).
As a result, the value of the side chain coin will always be equal to bitcoin (either 1:1 or some other static conversion rate that works both ways). It can never float. Therefore, you can't have a side chain that is pegged to another currency. 
If you *did* set up the side chain that way (through oracles and what not), that could mean you move bitcoin to the side chain, the value of bitcoin drops and you'd move more bitcoins back into the main bitcoin chain and that's impossible.

Let's hash this out a bit, to make it more clear. For the sake of argument, let's look at 3 popular actors on the network. Miners, full nodes and SPV wallets. 
The miner needs to generate the new blocks, so there's no gain for them. They now have to maintain two chains, instead of one.
The full node has to download two chains, so they're in the same boat as the miner. A node that chooses to ignore the new side chain doesn't gain anything from it either. 
The SPV wallet will have to download two sets of headers, so it gets worse for him too, unless the SPV wallet only works on one chain, in that case there is no gain for him at all and now only has access to that single chain.

The suppliers don't have to analyze any transactions to figure out what the markup is. They can just go to the website and figure it out from there. :) hey they're selling these things for $X but buying them from us for $Y.
Suppliers sell in bulk and don't want to deal with individual customers. That's why there are suppliers and merchants in the first place. This is all irrelevant to the discussion.
If you buy a phone from Apple as in your example, the money from that transaction isn't split. The whole amount is sent on to either *1* supplier or *1* employee or into the companies own profit account, etc. The idea is to look at the bigger picture.

Proof of burn is when you send the bitcoins to an address that can't possibly have a private key associated with it, for example:

You can broadcast the block yourself. You don't need the pool operator for that.


No. You have to report back the work you did just like regular pooled mining. That part isn't any different. If you don't do that, you're just a solo miner. Also, the nonce only works in the block you're working on. If you change anything, like the payout address(es) then the nonce is worthless.

Of the 6000 nodes tracked by 21.co, there are only 724 BU nodes on the network. If a chain split were to happen because some BU miners decide to start mining larger blocks, they will instantly split from the rest of the network, isolating themselves. This is exactly what happened when Ver's mining pool mined a block larger than 1MB. 
All other miners that continue to mine on the correct chain will stay in contact with the majority of those nodes and you know what those nodes will see? Slower blocks. That's all. They won't even be aware that a split has happened and they definitely won't kneejerk upgrade to some trashy bitcoin client written by Hobby Bob and his pals that has seen zero peer review or testing. 
No matter how much power those delusional miners think they have, it'll all turn to dust the second they break ranks.

The blockchain is the very definition of a settlement layer. It literally has no other function. It records transactions in chronological order and makes them computationally impossible to modify. 


Quite the opposite as a matter of fact. The Core Devs are trying very hard to preserve the p2p aspect of Bitcoin, but that will lead to moving the low value, high frequency transactions out of the chain and into a second layer, like Lightning. There are tradeoffs to be made and if those transactions have to go in order to safeguard that everybody can run a full node, then that's a reasonable choice to make. The low value, high frequency transactions are better off for it. They are no longer subject to 0-conf risk *and* they pay lower fees. Meanwhile, the blockchain itself will have more space for other transaction types. 


I didn't expect that people who are interested in Bitcoin, a bleeding-edge p2p global financial system, to be afraid of change. I for one am excited about these developments (having been in Bitcoin since early 2011), and hope that we will see more of these kinds of changes in the future. 
@_date: 2016-03-09 23:54:32
I disagree. The fullness of blocks is not nearly as big of an issue as it was previously made out to be. Full blocks don't cause a fee event as was previously believed, simply because of the varying nature of the transaction velocities / priorities. [This is not a smooth line]( not even if you look at the [seven day chart]( On top of that, the fee scenario assumes that participants in the system wouldn't change their stategies when faced with rising fees. Coinbase, previously using 2 transactions for a single withdrawal (wasteful) is now changing its systems to be more efficient. Yay. That's exactly what you would expect. People have more power than simply relying on the blockchain to handle the transactions that they throw at them. Optimizing their own usecases is where the low hanging fruit is.

This is not true. Segwit is determined by the receiver through the address the funds are sent to.The receiver generated the address, therefore his wallet is capable of Segwit. 


There is no such thing as a wtxid. Furthermore, the only difference between segwit as a soft fork and segwit as a hard fork is 33 bytes in the coinbase transaction (where the witness merkle root is stored). 


Based on the assumptions above, which are false. Everyone wins when segwit is used, since people that use segwit leave more space available for people that don't. 


[citation needed]. As stated above, the only difference between a soft fork version and a hard fork version is the witness merkle root in the coinbase.

Coinbase is a different story. They're not an exchange in the same what that Bitstamp is for example. Coinbase is a middle man. They buy bitcoin on exchanges on your behalf. That usually means they will make the purchase the second you place the order (with their own money) and then wait for your bank transfer to clear before handing over the purchased bitcoins. 
The other way around works the same way. They sell bitcoins they already hold on an exchange when you place your sell and will transfer you fiat (from their own account) right after that.

I don't think this is currently the case. Here's Eragmus' image of transaction volume again: 
And here's current fees: 
There are two spikes on the last one. One at 1-10 satoshi / byte and one at 41-50 satoshi / byte. To bypass all of these, you need a fee of 51 satoshi / byte. That's 13,158 satoshi's for a mean sized transaction. 
The fact that blocks are full is a poor indicator of urgency. Not all transactions are paying the same fees and getting ahead of the bulk of them requires a fraction more in fees.
@_date: 2016-03-04 01:59:53
You are assuming that every transaction currently is actually economic activity. It isn't. There are an enormous number of spam transactions currently on the network. If you look at the number of transactions excluding long chains of spam, then the numbers drop from [~230,000]( down to [~85,000]( In other words, 64% is junk. Those transactions are the first to be pushed out.

Load the private key into a regular bitcoin wallet and send the coins to your Trezor.

[My proposal]( allows for the (optional) encryption of BIP32 HD wallet root keys. It's no longer tied to a specific coin (it was in the initial draft), so you could use it for every coin that uses secp256k1 keys.
It has several other features:
- 3 root key lengths. 16, 32 and 64 bytes, so you can choose which one suits your needs best (QR code size).
- User selectable key derivation strength (KDF, to protect against brute-force attacks if someone finds your wallet).  Currently 3 are defined (all Scrypt based), but we can add up to 29 more.
- Optional date field that roughly indicates when the wallet was generated so blockchain rescans are more efficient. 
- When using the public key derivation side of the HD wallet, there's no need to decrypt your wallet root key to generate more receive addresses. 
- BIP32 wallets are also compatible with stealth addresses.
- Outsourcing of the KDF computation to a 3rd party so you can still use optimal protection on light weight hardware.
We're debating whether or not to add bloom filtering for password verification (instead of a checksum that it currently uses). This allows us to use 2 passwords, so that it's got built in plausible deniability. 
There are 3 implementations, of which 2 are available online (check the later pages of the discussion), but the spec is still in development and will probably go through several more revisions before it's finalized.

Adding new features will soon be a whole lot easier. Adding new opcodes was always limited to redefining one of the few unused NOP opcodes. 
NOPs currently don't do anything. They're basically ignored. To stay backwards compatible, a new feature was limited to changing that behaviour to return a failure after it checked something. It couldn't produce new values that can be used by other opcodes. Very restricted.
Once Segwit introduces script versions, it means that they can add / modify / remove any instruction type.

Sidechains are not a scaling solution. Both miners and full nodes will have to download both the Bitcoin blockchain and the sidechain blocks in order to fully validate them and that actually makes it a worse solution than simply increasing the block size of Bitcoin itself.
Even Blockstream employees such as [maaku7]( [Pieter Wuille](
, [Gregory Maxwell]( and other Core devs such as [Luke DashJr]( admit as much themselves.
Actual scaling solutions move transactions out of the blockchain, like Lightning and solutions that make more efficient use of available block space, like SegWit (and in the future a fork, when the system can support bigger sizes).

The key difference between LN and sidechains is that LN transactions are 1:1, only deal with modifying a single transaction that is eventually submitted to the blockchain and the intermediates aren't recorded publicly in any kind of chain. (This is the scaling part of Lightning.) 
Sidechains are the same as Bitcoin in that they record all transactions in a chain that needs to be verified by everyone on that chain, including the bitcoin chain if you care about the incoming / outgoing transactions, like miners and full nodes. They have to verify both the Bitcoin chain and the sidechain. So in that sense, it's not a network wide scaling solution. Only the single use case where you only care about the sidechain itself and trust that the Bitcoin main chain is secured do you lower the data traffic by ignoring the Bitcoin blockchain. That's a significant security assumption, on an even lower level than SPV today. Additionally, you haven't changed anything significant to the transaction model. Transactions on the sidechain are still recorded in blocks, they are still broadcast in blocks, they still need to be verified by all.
So I say again: Sidechains are not a scaling solution. :)

Like I said, maybe you missed it, increasing your fee by a little moves you up in priority.  And if you don't, you'll suffer some delays. What it comes down to is: do you want fast confirmations? If yes, increase fees, if no, carry on.

I think that this might be a bit of a misunderstanding. I think most people acknowledge the fact that 1MB isn't going to cut it over a longer period of time and that, when the risks have been properly mitigated, a hard fork will probably be planned. But it probably won't be a simple 1MB bump. It will most likely be something we can do with over a longer stretch of time. 
If we ignore all the surrounding noise, the major objections to the recent proposals have been:
XT's 8MB -&gt; 8GB - too aggressive. 
Classic's 2MB - too much risk for hardly any gain (in the long run), given that safer alternatives offer similar increases as a side effect. 
If a hard fork is to take place, let's make it a good one. The One to End Them All. The one that will finally settle this debate and everyone can focus on building a better Bitcoin again.

The thing is, it's not *just* an open source project. There's the greater Bitcoin community to consider. They have as much a say in these matters as the developers. And that's why many, if not all of the core devs have said, we do not have the authority to force consensus changes onto the community, however, they obviously aren't going to implement any changes that they themselves don't agree with. You can consider that stalling, or you can consider that an educated opinion.

This is exactly how everything is done. Internet started with simple dial-up modems and moved on to simple cable modems that could do 115k2 bps and moved on to ADSL, faster cable modems, fibre, etc. Same goes for Bitcoin. We started with paying directly to public key, then moved on to easier to use addresses, then we got pay to script hash for more complex scripts and so forth. These things are discovered and developed over time. Same for Segwit, Schnorr, MAST, etc. You can't wait for everything to be 100% complete before you move on to other things. You roll them out over time.

Go down to the pie chart and click on the button "Address Distribution". It'll show you that 97.3% of all addresses hold 0 to 0.001 bitcoin. That's $0 to $0.38. That's a lot of cruft. Bitcoin isn't a micropayment system. Even with 2MB blocks it can't support these types of activity.
So the first transactions to suffer (and rightly so) from full blocks will be that type of transaction. There are better ways to do micropayments, either through a service like changetip or hopefully in the not too distant future through systems like the lightning network.

This has been discussed at length. The miners are not "in control". They are a part of the ecosystem just like the developers, the node operators, the users, the merchants, the exchanges, the payment processors and whoever else you want to classify into a group. Miners can produce all the big blocks they want, but if the node operators don't accept / forward their blocks, then they're worthless. Similar, if wallet devs don't upgrade their clients to support those big blocks, then they're worthless. If users, merchants, exchanges, payment processors don't upgrade their clients, those blocks are worthless.
@_date: 2016-01-21 21:58:08

The fundamental problem with 0 conf is that it's *policy* based. Not *consensus* based. It's not enforceable. You are basically depending on the goodness of strangers not to allow someone to do anything nefarious like double spending. This is not a good basis to work from.
Opt-in RBF does not affect the way transactions work right now (0 conf is just as unsafe as it was before). The only thing it does is allow users to resend their transactions, with the caveat that they mark replaceable transactions. It allows people to un-stuck their transactions.

If he was, he wouldn't have perpetuated his misunderstandings in his original post. 
A hardfork is inevitable, even Core acknowledges that. But there are things that need to be done *first* before it is *safe* to do so. Things like IBLT, weak blocks, and others will preserve or even promote Bitcoin's decentralized nature.  That decentralization is the sole purpose we're here. 
But make no mistake, there is nothing decentralized about Bitcoin's consensus. It's 100% or nothing in that regard. *Everyone* needs to agree on the consensus rules as they are, or the system falls apart. That's why Core is so hesitant to present a hard fork, especially if they themselves don't think it's wise to do so at this time.

Together with libsecp256k1, that vastly improves block verification time, a block increase would probably be fine. 
The problem is that there are other pressing matters (malleability, amongst others) and the fact that segwit gives a capacity increase, is a soft fork and offers other advantages that that route is preferred over a hard fork, something that hasn't been done in recent years, [if at all](
Another reason is that a hard fork requires everyone to upgrade, something you shouldn't do lightly. So if you're going to hard fork, then a solution that is intended to be permanent is preferred. A 2MB fork is a short term plan, not something we could go multiple years with. So in order to solve it better, the propagation bottleneck would have to be solved before the size is increased. There are several plans being researched right now, such as weak blocks and iblt and perhaps others are found in the near future. 
In short, there are several things being worked on right now before a hard fork is advisable, but it will happen eventually, maybe even next year.

If you now open a second channel and then send funds to yourself through the other person, you basically rebalance the channel back to you by giving him funds through the second channel. You could shift parts of that 0.19 back to you by compensating the other party in a second channel.

The block size is not a limiting factor as of yet. There's a spectrum of fees and the tail end of it would be affected. The number of real transactions (not the barrage of spam we saw the last few days) is significantly less than the block size is right now. 
If you look at the number of  transactions, it currently sits around [230,000]( Sounds like a lot, doesn't it? Except when you look at the transactions, excluding chains longer than 10, it drops down to [90,000]( which means that 60% of those 230,000 transactions are junk. Those low fee paying spam transactions are the first ones to be pushed out.

Increasing MAX_BLOCK_SIZE is one way to get more capacity. SegWit is another.

You don't seem to understand. BU isn't being developed due to a difference of *opinion*. It is a hijack attempt plain and simple. These two 'sides' are never coming back together. 
It started with XT, followed by Classic, now BU and when that one has been thwarted there will be another one and another one. 
And with every one the quality will drop. XT stood the best chance to win, with Gavin and Mike, then classic with a patch from Gavin, but the rest was written by inexperienced coders. Now here's BU and it's a cluster fuck top to bottom. 
The reason for this is because it's becoming harder and harder to find suckers that can write code. 
This is a proxy war and it's not going to end. Rollout of features are being blocked with the promise of superior solutions, blaming the developers of stalled development, hoping to onboard more people and hijacking the network.

The blocksize increase isn't as 'clear' as it is made out to be. There were significant bottlenecks in the Core client when it came to block propagation in terms of latency and CPU utilization that weren't solved until recently (long after this whole block size debate started) and even then, a block size increase of 2MB isn't solving anything. It'll provide some extra storage but still has to fix the quadratic hashing bug currently present. So that's another thing to fix which didn't come to light until recently. Then there's the fact that it doesn't solve UTXO growth, which Segwit at least is trying to address by incentivizing people to consolidate their unspent outputs (by making spending cheaper than creating new outputs). And like I said, a 2MB increase is kicking the can down the road, because we'll be having this same discussion in 6 months to a year from now when that space is filled up. There are proposals for a flex-cap, but they aren't fully fleshed out and a lot of discussion around incentive alignment is still needed. If things were really that 'clear' and simple, the problem would have been solved by now. Nobody is looking for a fight here, but there's a lot more to consider than simply bumping the block size. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 05:25:14


Not much can be done through consensus rules without negatively affecting legitimate transactions. Block inclusion is miner policy. It's their choice which transactions they include. As an aside, filtering spam comes dangerously close to censorship. Censorship resistance is one of the core values of Bitcoin. Miners should tread carefully when forming their policies here. 




It's mostly about burst capacity when it comes to block verification. The main issue is cutting down the time it takes to flood the network with the new block. Faster verification -&gt; faster block propagation.
Segwit will enable some optimizations here in the future, but I don't think that those are available in the initial version. There was talk of graceful degradation of verification where a node could ramp down the segwit verification based on performance. If the witness data that's verified is chosen randomly, then the chance of an invalid block propagating successfully is very low, especially if a node that detects a violation broadcasts compact fraud proofs. (proofs that are easy to verify that prove that a block / transaction is invalid). I'm not entirely clear on the details of the above. It was mentioned in passing as a future expansion, and was light on details.
Edit: I should add that there are other proposals being worked on. [Invertible bloom lookup tables]( [PDF] is one such a proposal. Another one is weak blocks (email by [Gavin](  [another]( with more resources). There's also [Matt Corallo's fast block relay network]( that is already in use today.


Shhh, don't talk about block size decreases around here. That kind of talk will result in death threats. ;)


[Here's a video by Pieter Wuille]( about Segregated Witness. It's an hour long, but it's very informative.


The most popular counter solution (and also the most controversial) is a size bump to 2MB. It doesn't address any of the performance issues i described above (in fact, it makes it worse) and it only adds more storage, nothing else. Segregated Witness adds a host of functionality, and the capacity increase is a *byproduct*. A much better solution in my opinion.

Segwit fixes all of the above in a more elegant manner than BIP 62, which is why BIP 62 was withdrawn. It does this by moving the witness scripts into a different area in the transaction where it is not included in the transaction ID calculation, so any changes to this data as described above, would not alter the transaction ID.

Blocks containing segwit transactions still validate properly under the old rules. They are, after all, backwards compatible. With the distinction that the witness data for segwit transactions isn't verified by nodes that didn't upgrade. There is no new block format. There is an external block of data that contains the segregated witness data. 


[Current blocks are on average 600KB in size]( That's far from critical.
With segwit deployment and adoption, that adds significant capacity for the nearby future until a proper hard fork can be rolled out. And keep in mind. The capacity increase of segwit is a byproduct. It's primary features are:
- fixing transaction malleability.
- all future script upgrades are now soft forks, allowing faster and easier deployments of new features.
- it makes it easier for hardware wallets to generate new transactions, especially with large input transactions.
- it offers fraud proofs. SPV wallets can now check if what they receive is correct, without downloading the whole chain.
- it lowers storage requirements for nodes. They can delete the segwit data after a while and still keep the block.
- and last but not least, there's room for more transactions in the block. 
So what does a hard fork to 2MB give you?
- more room for transactions in the block.
I don't know about you, but I'll take segwit please.


... yes? They're still serving data to all the non upgraded SPV wallets out there. Losing nodes means losing access points to the network for all those mobile wallets. That's a Bad Thing.

People should run full nodes to validate their own incoming transactions first and foremost. That's most likely the case for the nodes that don't accept incoming connections. Nodes that do also serve SPV nodes. There are thousands of nodes, so SPV wallets are served pretty well right now. 
Those nodes that don't accept incoming connections aren't useless. They still fully validate and will reject any attempt at a protocol change by any third party.

In order to prove something isn't included into whatever merkle tree you produce (that has to somehow be anchored in the block, or it's worthless), you need to download the entire tree. You would need the block header, the coinbase transaction (since that's probably where you'd store the root of that tree) and all the addresses in question to prove that something wasn't included in the block. you should write a BIP and propose it to the devs. see what they have to say about that.

A Lightning channel is opened by committing a root transaction in the blockchain.

Satoshi was assuming that *everyone* was mining back then. He made no distinction between a miner and a regular full node. 
On top of that. This is the first document describing bitcoin. A lot has been learned since then. For one, it's not just the miners that have a say in this, but everyone. The nodes that forward blocks will have to agree, or the miners blocks will not reach the users. The developers of wallet software will have to agree, or the blocks will still be rejected. The merchants, exchanges, payment processors and users will have to agree, or their clients will reject those blocks too.

The main argument is: 
In the event of a hard fork fully validating nodes that don't upgrade, are booted off the main chain. That's the *best case* scenario. 
In the event of a soft fork, fully validating nodes are reduced to SPV level security. That's the *worst case* scenario. 
The latter sounds, to me at least, preferable. People can upgrade over time, whereas in the case of a hard fork, people have a deadline to upgrade (the fork flag day).

It's a coinbase transaction. That means that those are the fees from all other transactions that are added to this transaction. 
It's less confusing on blockchain.info:
@_date: 2017-02-21 19:13:05




may contain payments by multiple parties.  Each input owner signs their
input.  For a new version to be written, each must sign a higher sequence
number (see IsNewerThan).  By signing, an input owner says "I agree to put
my money in, if everyone puts their money in and the outputs are this."
 There are other options in SignatureHash such as SIGHASH_SINGLE which
means "I agree, as long as this one output (i.e. mine) is what I want, I
don't care what you do with the other outputs.".  If that's written with a
high nSequenceNumber, the party can bow out of the negotiation except for
that one stipulation, or sign SIGHASH_NONE and bow out completely.


nSequenceNumber tx using OP_CHECKMULTISIG that requires a subset of parties
to sign to complete the signature.  The parties hold this tx in reserve and
if need be, pass it around until it has enough signatures.


 They can keep updating a tx by unanimous agreement.  The party giving
money would be the first to sign the next version.  If one party stops
agreeing to changes, then the last state will be recorded at nLockTime.  If
desired, a default transaction can be prepared after each version so n-1
parties can push an unresponsive party out.  Intermediate transactions do
not need to be broadcast.  Only the final outcome gets recorded by the
network.  Just before nLockTime, the parties and a few witness nodes
broadcast the highest sequence tx they saw.

If that second address is the same as your paper wallet, then you basically imported your private key. You now have to update your backup. 
You may want to switch to a better wallet though. Blockchain.info is a previous generation wallet that still requires you to make periodic backups. It's best to switch to something like Breadwallet on iOS, Mycelium on Android or Multibit HD on Windows / Mac / Linux.
All of the above work with a word list backup (12 or 24 words) that you only have to write down once, when you setup your wallet. All your keys from that moment on will be recoverable.

Segwit adds additional capacity, and they are also working on a hardfork proposal for bigger blocks once the system can handle them. So no, it's not LN or bust.
@_date: 2017-02-25 22:37:16
Witness data is hashed and the merkle root is stored in the coinbase transaction, which is hashed into the merkle root that is stored in the header, so no, you can't modify the witness data as it would invalidate the merkle root in the coinbase transaction, which would invalidate the merle root in the header, which would invalidate the block hash. 
Witness data of a transaction is stored together with that transaction, not in a "separate area". When a non witness node requests the block, it is serialized out without the witness data and that data is always less than 1MB. That's the backwards compatibility. A Segwit node requesting a block would receive the block with interleaved witness data in tact. 
The advantage is that it's 100% backwards compatible. Old nodes don't need to upgrade to new software if they don't want to. All wallets will keep working, merchants, exchanges, everything keeps working. "Just increasing the block size" would require everyone to upgrade, because when they don't they won't be able to transact anymore. A soft fork therefore is a far easier and safer way to increase transaction capacity than any hardfork ever will be.

@_date: 2016-01-19 00:29:38


You would think that, but that's not the case. Not a single SPV wallet verifies this data, because it requires the inputs of the transactions being spent *and* the entire UTXO to see if has already *been* spent. So no, it's not checked in any wallet other than a fully validation one, like Bitcoin Core. 


Bitcoin Core nodes detect the activation of new rules through the block version. It will show a warning on screen.


It is Opt-in for the *users* of it, because only the people that choose to use it generate segwit transactions. The security of segwit doesn't change for anyone that isn't validating and reduces to SPV level (depending on the other nodes in the network) for people that are fully validating. Those people are warned beforehand when the network is generating new version blocks. The client warns you. 


You've got things mixed up. You are already publishing segwit addresses, they're just backwards compatible. The segwit part of this doesn't kick in until you, the one that issued the segwit address, spend that output to someone else. That's your part of the transaction, you set the rules there. The sender and future receiver have no business dictating to you how you choose to secure your outputs. That's like saying, I don't want you to send me coins that were multi-sig before. How is that fair to you? That's none of their concern.

The community shouldn't be involved in technical discussions. That's a surefire way to derail it into petty infighting. Technical discussions should be limited to knowledgeable participants for the same reasons that development should be limited to knowledgeable participants or you end up with a steaming pile of shit. 
If proposals don't survive peer review by other developers, then there's no reason to have the general public discuss them. The proposal has been found insufficient. 
If you want to participate in technical discussions, learn to code, learn crypto, get a math degree, get a CS degree, then learn bitcoin and by that I mean all the tiny little details. And when you've done that, that's when you get to participate in the discussion.

I'm not disputing the rest of your post, but this statement is incorrect. Maximizing for total transactions per block will result in lower fees per transaction because you're not penalizing low fee transactions. Miners need better policy tools to setup their end of the fee market. That means that they should be selling 'time' not 'space'. Delaying low fee transactions (or a gradient from high to low), will result in a healthy fee market. I talked about this earlier in this [post](

The Linux analogy doesn't apply because those distributions are totally independent of each other. Whatever one team does, does not affect the other.
In Bitcoin it's different. They share the block chain. If one team attempts to change the consensus rules, they affect other teams that use that same block chain. So if BU wants to change consensus rules, they best start their own block chain and not interfere with other teams.

@_date: 2016-01-26 05:51:27


secp256k1 is the elliptic curve that Bitcoin uses for its cryptographic signatures. Right now, OpenSSL is used to verify that the signatures in the transactions are correct. The OpenSSL implementation is a general purpose implementation that supports many different curves. libsecp256k1, written by Pieter Wuille, Gregory Maxwell and others is a dedicated, highly optimized implementation of the secp256k1 curve. It is 4 to 7 times faster than the OpenSSL implementation. When block verification is faster, so is propagation. 


Well, to be fair, libsecp256k1 isn't a user facing feature. It's an optimization that helps propagation.
Same goes for segwit. It's a foundational change that makes it easier to roll out features in the future, and it makes stuff like the lightning network possible (malleability). The most tangible thing right now with segwit is that it would give users a discount on the fee. 
So you're right, devs should communicate more, at least, they should probably filter it through someone that can break it down into easy to understand language, but it doesn't help that most of the changes are long term foundational changes. 


You're right. The ultimate goal is to move as much of the data transmission and verification to before a block is found, so that most of the network is already up-to-date and block propagation / verification is extremely fast. Once that point is reached, Bitcoin is in very good shape. 


IBLT is another one of those highly technical things that are hard to explain and have absolutely no effect on end users. It's a mechanism to improve block propagation. Between the two, I think weak blocks are probably the best solution, but who knows. I haven't studied these two in detail yet.

You don't care that the transaction that is paying you is segwit. It's part of the input side of the transaction. The part that the sender controls. It's not in the output side of the transaction. The part that you control. 


That's why it needs super majority miner support. They are the ones confirming it into the blockchain. Checking validity on a transaction is only done by miners and fully validating nodes. 
If you care about 100% verification, you're running Core to begin with and should be upgrading to remain 100% validating. SPV wallets never did this to begin with. They can't since they don't have an up-to-date UTXO database and a mempool. There is no difference for these nodes.

Ideally, a proper fee level is found by both the miners and the users. Miners set up their own fee schedule and users choose what's acceptable for them. Both will tweak their numbers accordingly.
If miners want higher fees than people are willing to spend, their blocks will not contain many transactions, so they have less income. 
If users set fees too low, their transactions will take more time to confirm.
These two forces will balance each other out eventually. There's no magic value for a fee. It all depends on supply and demand.

Nobody is denying that you'll be able to have more transactions. The issue is, you can't get them with the same security tradeoffs without incurring heavier costs than simply increasing Bitcoin's block size by the same size as the side chain. You are falling for the trap that you only consider a single use case. You have to account for the miners (that have to validate both chains), the full nodes (that have to validate both chains) and SPV nodes (that have to validate both chains' headers). All the above cases are worse off, just so you can transact on a side chain in isolation. That's not a scaling solution.

Any node. And as a miner, you can combat this by doing validationless mining.


Both transmission and validation, although 0.12 shipped with libsecp256k1 enabled for validation, which made the validation significantly faster (5-7x). 


The relay network is operated by Matt Corallo and is available to anyone; both the protocol (open source) and the network itself. I'm not 100% sure, but I recall that most (if not all) miners use it. 
In any event, Bitcoin's p2p block propagation is the simplest, most naive attempt at relaying blocks. There is a lot of room to grow. The above described relay protocol (basically thin blocks) could work, but it's not a drop-in replacement. It sends everything unprompted (no invs) and with minimal validation. IBLT and weak blocks are also good contenders to improve block relay.

The only attack possible is by miners trying to spend the "anyone can spend" outputs of segwit transactions. Non-segwit nodes won't propagate these transactions and segwit nodes will reject them as invalid, leaving just miners that modified their nodes specifically to attack these transactions. 
So what it comes down to is non-aggression. They don't have to support it since it doesn't affect them, leaving just the option for them to blatantly attacking it, causing a chain split, where only non-segwit nodes will accept that attack as valid and segwit nodes rejecting that chain as invalid. Let's see how that plays out.

The issue is already addressed. The problem is, you can't flip the switch on something like that so easily. All wallet implementations out there need to be updated and users need to upgrade. This takes time. 
The issue that really needs to be addressed is that MtGox's wallet implementation shouldn't depend on transaction hashes. But they thought it would be OK to blame the protocol instead of owning up and fixing their wallet. 
The issue has been known for a long time and they did nothing to fix it on their end.
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:49:23
Then you haven't been paying attention. A node will follow the longest *valid* chain. Considering that &gt; 90% is Core, that means that BU blocks will be ignored by the vast majority, regardless of the amount of hash power behind it. This has been the case from day 1.
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:21:03




Because simply increasing the block size without addressing network latency, network bandwidth, memory consumption and disk usage would have had a crippling effect on the number of full nodes on the network. Their number has been going down hard since 2011. 


They were prepping the client to be able to handle an eventual capacity increase and there were a number of solutions being discussed, none of which to the liking of most developers. When SegWit was announced, it was seen as the proper way forward, because it was a soft fork and because it solved far more than just increasing capacity, such as malleability, quadratic hashing bug, ability to do selective validation in the future, easier to introduce new scripting solutions through script versioning, and so forth. This type of proposal eclipses any simple block size bump, simply because it solves so many issues all at once. When SetWit is acive, and Schnorr is active, and MAST is active and whatever other scaling soft forks there could come around, by that time the Flex Cap idea will hopefully have been worked out further and a hard fork addressing block size scaling can be implemented. 


It would cause the drop of full nodes to accelerate (due to the resource requirements), it would give larger miners an edge over smaller ones due to block propagation:

I was thinking more along the lines of having smaller data packets and a smaller checksums and then concatenating several of those chunks together. That would also free you of the size limit you talked about in the presentation. 
Then again, I have no idea how this works so maybe it would become too inefficient.

@_date: 2017-03-09 09:52:53
To clarify, a hardfork version of Segwit would only remove 33 bytes of data from the coinbase transaction and it would come with a down side. SPV wallets would have to transfer more data to validate if a transaction is included in a block, so it's a less efficient implementation at that.
As for segwit addresses, that would stay exactly the same. A hardfork wouldn't change anything here.
@_date: 2016-01-26 23:58:54
1) I think that Adam's proposal is reasonable, with the caveat that the planned propagation optimizations are finished and functional before the hard fork is released to the general public. If all goes to plan, that work should be done this year (according to the roadmap). The reason I'd add the above caveat is, *should things take longer / not pan out*, there's still time to move to alternatives before a fork triggers.
2) I don't see how Core is responsible for the conduct of moderators on a private forum. Even if you were to ask every single member of the core dev team, and they'd all agree, I still don't think that Core as a collective needs to address any of this.

What kind of evidence is there to support this claim? The only thing I know of is that miners don't want the cap to be raised by a large amount all at once. They were prepared to go to 8MB, which is already an 8 fold increase of what we have now. And the Core developers (the ones that signed the roadmap at least) weren't even comfortable with *that*. So how is it that the miners are the bad guys here?
There are scaling issues. They have to be addressed before capacity can be increased without compromising the delicate decentralization of Bitcoin as it is. Block propagation is basically the Achilles heel that needs to be addressed first.

It's not a solution. You can't solve policy issues since everyone can choose to run their own policies. There is no enforcement. The blockchain itself is the only enforcement in Bitcoin. If you aren't depending on the blockchain, you're basically *trusting* third parties not to defraud you, regardless of if it's a regular transaction (that can already be double spent trivially) or RBF. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 21:01:56
It's hard to provide concrete proof. After being here a while, you just start to notice certain patterns. for example calls out new accounts that have an unusual amount of knowledge of bitcoin (and then argue against it). 
On top of that, posts of well known people in bitcoin getting down voted (a LOT) even though they make reasonable arguments. 
The most blatant one was the ethereum spamming that's been going on the last few days. This wasn't XT "propaganda" but it shows that there are people out there that are "attacking" the community.
And this is pure speculation: Peter R's account being suspended by Reddit (not the mods) means he broke site wide rules. Whichever rules he broke, I don't know, but if I had to guess, it would either be sockpuppeting or vote manipulation.
@_date: 2016-01-30 09:10:56
This isn't necessarily true. You are assuming that the Bitcoin network will always run at capacity and that only by paying a high fee you can actually transact on chain. 
I personally would consider that a failure if that were the case. Capacity is an important aspect, in fact, it's one of the major focus points of core's roadmap this year. 
There are disadvantages to transacting on chain. For one, it takes time for a transaction to be included and even longer for the certainty of irreversibility to grow. 
Off chain solutions, like lightning offer the same security with the advantage of instant payments and negligible  fees, not to mention privacy enhancements through onion style routing and the fact that not all transactions appear on chain. 
Even the "elite" as you call them will prefer this mode of operation as it gives more advantages than bare bones Bitcoin does. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 20:09:39


Replying to you here, so you'll hopefully see it. The above is not the case. Segwit won't use new addresses. It was proposed, but not favored by many developers, for mainly the reason you stated. Instead, Segwit will be compatible with pay to script hash (P2SH, addresses starting with a 3) that's been in use for quite some time now. 
To reiterate, Segwit is a soft fork and the burden of constructing segwit transactions lies with the person how *chooses to do so*. It affects nobody other than that person. Not the people sending payments to P2SH segwit addresses and not the people receiving payment from a segwit transaction. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 06:26:24
You can abandon a transaction in the console.

Folks, let's not get ahead of ourselves. One of the big failings of BU is the lack gaining consensus amongst developers and a lack of review of the changes. Prematurely running a UASF client is no different when it hasn't been properly reviewed by developers. I understand the eagerness of wanting to activate Segwit, but we are strongest if we stick together, so that when we move, we move as one and decisively. 
If UASF Segwit is accepted by the developer community, a proper Core version will be released that contains it. Until then, please be patient.
If you object to this, that's ok, but realize that you'll be taking on a risk and won't be following the majority.
@_date: 2016-01-18 01:27:47


You are making the assumption that your node can even interpret the data in the new blocks. Hard forks are not backwards compatible. For a simple thing as block size increase, sure, you're fine. But let's say they hard fork in more precision to the value field. Then you're hosed. You can't even parse the new blocks.
@_date: 2016-01-19 04:36:44


And they will. Segwit comes into play when sending a transaction. Not when receiving it. So if your hardware wallet doesn't support Segwit yet, then it won't generate segwit scripts and won't construct segwit data when sending a transaction, but just a regular transaction.
Segwit is a softfork. Everything out there will keep working just like it does now.

First off, "tremendous" is an overstatement. The Segwit implementation is less lines of code than the XT patch for 2MB is that Classic is basing their fork on. 
Second, the functionality *has* been proven to be needed as the primary motivation for Segwit is to eliminate transaction malleability, something that's caused numerous issues in the past.


What about Segwit is private exactly? It's all open source. And how exactly do you consider it to be less secure? If you're going to be making statements like these, please back them up with some actual evidence.

The second output is 0.00000412 BTC, which is really small. That's referred to as a dust output. Something miners aren't too happy with. It's also known as UTXO (unspent transaction output) database bloat.
There's a good chance your transaction won't be picked up by anyone and it'll be dropped soon. I don't know if your wallet supports rescanning, but that should clear it from your pending list. 
Strange that your wallet allowed you to even send it. I'd go find another wallet. Breadwallet is a good alternative.

Yes, because you want to know all the transactions you sent / received, not just one particular set. 


Right now SPV clients send a bloom filter which doesn't contain addresses directly, but reveals them indirectly when applied to addresses found in blocks. There are objections to this mechanism already, because it does leak information this way.


If you do partials, say the lower x bytes of an address, then you could filter the list, but again, you need sufficient surrounding information to make sure that nothing is held back from you. 


You really should. I had a lot of fun writing my own bitcoin client. Understanding all the intricacies of the system, working out all the crypto stuff (I switched to libsecp256k1 when bouncy castle proved to be incredibly slow), figuring out all the opcodes, syncing up the testnet blockchain and seeing your script interpreter choke on Maxwell's test transactions, implementing BIP32 for a wallet, etc.

You can't. Your client wouldn't understand a segwit address to send to and people with segwit wallets can't send a segwit (output) transaction to you, because your wallet doesn't generate segwit addresses. In that regard, it's basically the same as P2SH transactions (where the address starts with a 3). If your wallet doesn't understand P2SH addresses, it can't send transactions to it, and someone else can't send you a P2SH transaction to you, because you can't provide him with a P2SH address.

For example, 21.co was working on decentralizing pooled mining (in particular P2Pool), but I can't find a link for you right now.

That would slow down development considerably. If you feel that that's a sound way forward, then I'm fine with that, but that means we're not going to see a capacity increase this year. At all. I personally feel that reducing non-upgraded nodes to SPV for those specific transactions only is an acceptable risk. 


You're right. And they shouldn't. 
Unrelated, but that's one of the things that worry me about Bitcoin Classic. They are (were?) targeting a March 1^st activation with a 4 week grace period. That's *really* fast.

Fixing flaws with middle men is not the preferred method. Cryptography is far more flexible and preferable.
Take chargebacks that you mentioned for example. Currently on your credit card, you have chargeback protection. This is a service that you pay for. It applies to all of your credit card transactions when in fact you probably would only ever consider using it for only a fraction of those.
With Bitcoin, you can achieve the same effect by using an independent arbitrator instead of a middle man. This arbitrator would only have the power to either send the funds to the party you are transacting with, or back to you. 
Bitcoin transactions are programmable. You can incorporate tiny scripts in them that determine what will happen and (since recently) when. How this works:
You create a payment script that will only validate to true if:
- 1 month has passed, at which point the payment can be claimed by the party you are transacting with (if he is the receiver that is).
- 2 of a total of 3 signatures is presented. One produced by you, one produced by the other party, and one produced by the arbitrator.
These are the resolution paths:
- If you receive your product, you and the other party can both sign a transaction that sends the funds immediately to the receiver. 
- If you didn't receive your product, you appeal to the arbitrator and after providing sufficient information, you and the arbitrator can decide to send the funds back to you.
- If you are making a false claim, the other party and the arbitrator can decide to move the funds to the receiver immediately.
- If the arbitrator disappears, you and the receiver can decide to either send the payment directly to the receiver, back to you, or start again with a new arbitrator.
- In the event of no action by any party, the funds automatically go to the receiver. 
The advantages are as follows:
- You can choose whether or not you want to use an arbitrator for every transaction you send. 
- You and the party you are transacting with can choose which arbitrator to use.
- As a result, there will be competition between arbitrators, which will likely result in lower fees. 
- Since there is no arbitrator lock-in (you can pick whichever on you and the other party agree on), they have their reputation on the line. Unfavourable reviews of arbitrators will result in loss of income for them.
- Arbitrators can't run off with your money. It always requires either you or the receiver to sign the spending transaction.
Having said all that, you might ask yourself "That looks like a fantastic idea! I wonder how many parties have implemented any of that." And the answer would be very little, if any at all. That would be a flaw in the bitcoin economy. Development of user facing features such as the above isn't moving very fast.

[Does Opt-in RBF make fraudulent spends significantly more successful?](












@_date: 2016-01-18 05:31:26


Wouldn't it be great if it was though? Because it can be. LN pretty much makes that happen. Granted, it's not done yet, but they're getting there. See the two depots I linked above.


Here's your money... maybe. That's useful to you?


That has always been the case. It's only more in-your-face with RBF. 


Or maybe an alternative, your own knowledge on the subject being insufficient? You should read through the [RBF FAQ](


It wasn't. RBF isn't even deployed yet and Peter Todd managed to double spend against Coinbase. Arguably the largest Bitcoin company in the US. You'd expect them to have all their ducks in a row. Apparently not.


This has nothing to do with the block size. And for your information. Increasing the block size isn't a goal. It's a means to an end, namely increasing capacity. Something that's clearly addressed in the developer [roadmap]( that has near unanimous support from the Core developers. 


Now you're just venting, aren't you? :) 


Except for the annoying fact that the 1MB limit was implemented by Satoshi and, when asked, was unwilling to raise it until necessary.


Bitcoin will never replace Visa in its current form. Making blocks bigger means less nodes and less miners. There are smarter ways of achieving that goal and merely increasing the blocks size is not it.


I'm happy that the Core developers aren't playing it fast and loose with $5.6Bln on the line.


[Reductio ad absurdum]( The requirements to run a full node right now are already pretty high considering the amount of network traffic that's generated. It's already around 150GB on average a month in order to sufficiently propagate blocks to other nodes. 


There is a maximum number of connections that a node will accept at any given time. If the number of nodes drops then all those SPV mobile wallets will start to get "Unable to connect to network" messages. Would kind of suck, wouldn't you say?

I don't really care to be honest. I'm fine with 1MB blocks for now.


They are free to do as they please. They owe us absolutely nothing.


They don't (and they will tell you as such, if you ask them). All they can do is write code and offer it to the users. It's up to the users if they want to run it or not. 


Because it's another cheap and easy way to increase capacity quickly. It can be activated in a matter of weeks if miners cooperate, giving everyone more space. A proper hardfork rollout will take at least a year to properly permeate the economy, where everyone has upgraded and tested their software (wallets, ATM's, exchanges, websites, you name it). A soft fork will beat a hard fork in deployment speed every time.

Yes. The chain is fully validated, but old blocks are deleted. They were only ever served to other nodes that are syncing up the blockchain. Your node does nothing with them. Keeping a history of a couple weeks is more than enough to help the vast majority of nodes sync up to head.
@_date: 2016-01-19 23:30:04


There have been some periods when block size was redlining, all of which were manufactured through transaction spam. Real economic activity is much lower than what you see here. 
Compare the [number of transactions]( with the [number of transactions excluding chains longer than 10 transactions to/from the same address]( 
The subtext from blockchain.info on long chains: 




Not sure what you mean here. Bitcoin miners are independent entities. There is no central planning in Bitcoin that adds / removes miners. They are financially incentivized to mine. More is better, but it doesn't make transaction throughput go faster.


Network latency is actually the biggest bottleneck in Bitcoin right now. It has an immediate effect on the miners' bottom line. Stale blocks are wasted effort and any kind of increase in latency has a direct effect on block stale rate. Miners have tried solving this themselves to disastrous effect, mining on top of blocks of others without validating them. 
Solving the latency problem is one of the  things that has to be addressed before capacity can be increased or we start losing network security (more stale blocks -&gt; more wasted effort -&gt; hashing power not being used to protect the main chain) and loss of miner income (incentivizing them to do dangerous things again). Edit: on top of that, node count will go down due to higher resource demand, and it has a centralizing pressure on mining. All bad things.


Block size is a means to an end. The ultimate goal is increased *capacity*, through whichever means is best. Right now Segregated Witness is the prime contender for this, simply because it has a capacity increase as a side effect. Its primary features alone are also worth the effort to have it, even if it didn't offer a capacity increase.
Those features are:
- fixing transaction malleability.
- all future script upgrades are now soft forks, allowing faster and easier deployments of new features.
- it makes it easier for hardware wallets to generate new transactions, especially with large input transactions.
- it offers fraud proofs. SPV wallets can now check if what they receive is correct, without downloading the whole chain.
- it lowers storage requirements for nodes. They can delete the segwit data after a while and still keep the block.
- and last but not least, there's room for more transactions in the block.

Because the design of Lightning allows for unbounded transactions between many parties without impacting the blockchain. The number of transactions is no longer a limiting factor, only the number of users. So as people transition from doing regular Bitcoin transactions to Lightning, the space in the blockchain will be utilized far more efficiently. That's one of the properties of the design as it is proposed and is currently being developed. [They've done simulations to show that it works]( On top of that, the transactions are instant, can't be double spent and have lower fees since there is a far lower cost to them (they aren't individually stored in the blockchain). All those properties together makes it a very attractive solution to scale one of Bitcoin's usecases, namely high frequency, low value transactions.

You'd think that, but that's not the case. If you ignore RBF transactions, then you could be happily forwarding ones that are regular, but could be double spending against them. 
Ignoring transactions (of any kind) as a full node isn't good. There's going to be nodes out there that don't and then you give people an opportunity to exploit this.

BU is an attempt to hijack Bitcoin development by a small closed group of developers.


BU will hand the power to increase the block size to the miners which will mean that regular people  eventually won't be able to run full nodes to verify the integrity of the blockchain.


Most likely never.


That little drop is hardly a 'bubble burst'. A true burst would be a drop of 50%.

A miner mining an invalid block is the only victim in this case. The block wouldn't propagate. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 06:35:29
Transaction volume based scaling is too easy to game by big miners (forcing small miners out). It costs them nothing to fill up their blocks with fluff transactions to artificially increase the block size. 
There is a natural incentive for them to do this to force out competitors that can't keep up with bigger blocks.
If you really want a flex cap, then there needs to be some form of cost to the miners to increase the block size in order to negate the above incentive to inflate blocks. 
There was a flex cap proposal a while ago that was discussed at length. I haven't kept up with the discussion though. 
Edit: To illustrate what I meant with the no cost part and why there should be a cost:
A block currently yields the following income:
Income = X (block reward) + Y (3rd party transaction fees)
When a miner inflates the block size, the following happens:
Income = X (block reward) + Y (3rd party transaction fees) + 0 (self generated transaction fees)
The self generated ones are basically left pocket to right pocket for the sole purpose of filling up the block. Even if there were fees, they'd still go back to the miner himself, so no money is actually spent.
If there was a cost to increasing the block size, the formula would become:
Income = X (block reward) + Y(3rd party transaction fees) + 0 (self generated transaction fees) - Z (cost of block increase)
Since the self generated transaction fees don't earn money, they actually *cost* money through Z. So a miner is now incentivized to cancel out Z and the only way to do that is to increase Y, exactly what we want.
@_date: 2017-03-26 06:30:08


Now you're just being silly. 


This doesn't just apply to storage. For older blocks they can omit transmission cost as well. When syncing the blockchain, a node currently downloads all blocks, but only verifies signatures of recent blocks. The scripts of those older blocks were just dead weight during transmission. With Segwit, nodes now have the option to not even download it, saving on bandwidth.

Very well said. 
The whole point of Bitcoin is to try and distribute and dilute responsibility as much as possible, so that the actions of any adversarial actor in the system does not result in compromise of the system. 
That alone is enough reason to fix malleability as it's possible for one actor to wield a small amount of power over others (for example invalidating long unconfirmed chains of transactions by confirming a malleated root in a block). This was an oversight and ideally this power should be taken back by the users.
Core devs not wanting to advocate for / push adoption of any change other than offering education on what the change does is an extension of distribution / dilution of responsibility. They realize that trying to wield any kind of power will only have adverse effects in the long run for either themselves or the system at large. 
So in a nutshell, be wary of anyone seeking any kind of power in Bitcoin, for whatever reason. You control what you do with your coins, you control what software you wish to run and you are responsible for educating yourself on whatever software or service is offered by anyone.

You would have to renegotiate your channel. If however you don't want your channel to be associated with the new funds, what you could also do is open a new channel with your new funds and then send an LN transaction to yourself to rebalance the old channel.

You might want to do some research on your own before asking these questions. 
Being able to run a node yourself means you don't have to trust any third party when it comes to Bitcoin transactions. If you run a node on a third party server, you now implicitly trust that server to feed you sane data, or you have to run regular integrity tests / confirm with other nodes, etc. Bitcoin is about trustless value transmission and censorship resistance. Node centralization and by extension miner centralization would have a detrimental effect on both those attributes.

I understand where you're coming from, I was arguing from your position not even a year ago, but the recent event with Peter Todd and Coinbase illustrates quite clearly that it's easily possible to double spend vulnerable companies. 
Coinbase, arguably the larges Bitcoin company in the US is fooled by a [tiny 220 line python script]( 
The point I'm trying to make is, the effort required by the receiver to protect himself against 0 conf double spends is disproportional to the effort required to double spend. There's no solid base to build on to even start to make it properly safe. That's just it. That's the whole reason the blockchain was invented in the first place. To protect against double spends. From the abstract of the Bitcoin white paper:


If you're not using the blockchain, you're vulnerable to double spends. 
And that's also why solutions like Lightning are being worked on. To enable instant, low cost transactions that are safe. There are, as far as I know, 2 implementations in the works.

I'm not familiar with your wallet software. 
To be clear, your money isn't gone. 
This is your current balance in that particular address: 
It's still right where it was before you sent this transaction. It's just that your local wallet won't allow you to send it a second time since that would conflict with that transaction. 
Check if the settings have something called rescan and see where it goes from there.
Another option is to try and do a restore from backup (you do have a backup, right?). Backups usually only contain the keys and not any transactions, so it should be gone once it's done restoring your wallet.

No. RAID means **R**edundant **A**rray of **I**nexpensive **D**isks. It's meant to add redundancy. You aren't scaling when adding more disks means that same multiplier is also applied to the price. 


DB clusters are meant to add redundancy as well. Same deal. You increase capacity where the price is subject to the same multiplier. You scale DB's by adding a cache layer that can respond to repetitive queries with cached results. That's how you get order of magnitude scaling at a fraction of the cost. That's scaling. 


Because that means people will no longer be able to verify everything and bitcoin's "zero trust" model dies. You wouldn't know if the 21M cap is still in place, or if someone double spent, etc. You need to be able to verify everything or bitcoin is worthless.

MAST stands for merkleized abstract syntax trees. What this basically means is that all paths that a script can choose to evaluate are hashed. Only the path that's executed during evaluation is provided with only hashes of branches that are skipped to prove the script is genuine. This saves space and enhances privacy since the paths that weren't evaluated aren't revealed.

You can't setup a channel between more than 2 parties (although there has been talk about it, I don't think this'll be in the initial release) in a single transaction. If you are sending funds from you -&gt; A -&gt; B, then all 3 parties are aware of what is going on (since it's 2 channels between you -&gt; A and A -&gt;B).

They generate "immutability". In order to rewrite the blockchain, you would have to redo the proof of work for the blocks you are trying to overwrite. 


The calculations themselves are "useless" by design. If they had any value outside of Bitcoin, then there is the possibility that those computations could become more valuable outside of Bitcoin. If that were the case, Bitcoin mining would switch over to sell their work outside of Bitcoin, bringing block generation to a screeching halt. 


Bitcoin is not anonymous and is a terrible way to buy drugs online. See what happened to Silk Road and even those two corrupt officers that were caught stealing. Bitcoin is pseudonymous. An easier way to describe it is "user defined privacy". You can be as private and as public as you want. The point is, it's your choice.

"transactions in the mempool" is a bit vague. A better way of saying it is "transactions selected from the mempool to be included into the block". And yes.

Segwit offers many badly needed features, the malleability fix is just one of them. Script versioning that will make adding new script features a lot easier is another one.

Sorry, but that's incorrect. Supply is units available for trade. If it were total, then by that logic all the cars in the world today would be "the supply" of cars, when it's clear that the vast majority of those aren't for sale. 
The same goes for Bitcoin. Coins available for trade are what matters. Now assuming that all freshly minted coins going straight to an exchange is incorrect too, I'll grant you that. The numbers are most likely less than that. But the point still stands; the number of freshly minted coins available for trade will decrease. 
As for the exchange volume, much of that is the same bitcoins changing hands in rapid succession. The total number of bitcoins being traded is far less than 1 million.

Let's go through it line by line:
    int halvings = nHeight / consensusParams.nSubsidyHalvingInterval;
The above divides the current block height by the Subsidy Halving Interval. The block height is simply the current block number. The Genesis block is block 0, followed by a block mined by Satoshi, etc. As of this writing, we're at block number [416,322](
The Subsidy Halving Interval is set to 210,000, which, at 1 block every ~10 minutes comes to about 4 years. 
    // Force block reward to zero when right shift is undefined.
    if (halvings &gt;= 64)
        return 0;
This code is meant to prevent the shift right below to shift with values larger that 63. It's safe to return 0 here, since the reward would be zero long before halvings reaches 64. This code was added a few years ago to fix a bug, since on some computer architectures shifting with values larger than the number of bits that a register holds is undefined. Here's [BIP 42]( that describes the bug in more detail.
    CAmount nSubsidy = 50 * COIN;
This calculates the start reward in Satoshi's. 50 * 100,000,000 = 5,000,000,000 satoshi. One bitcoin is 100,000,000 satoshi. 
    // Subsidy is cut in half every 210,000 blocks which will occur approximately every 4 years.
    nSubsidy &gt;&gt;= halvings;
This is where the actual reward calculation happens. Shifting to the right by halvings means dividing by 2 "halvings" times. 
    return nSubsidy;
This is where the calculated subsidy is returned up the call stack. The function is done.
Let's take this code for a spin on the current block height, ok?
    int halvings = nHeight / consensusParams.nSubsidyHalvingInterval;
halvings = 416,322 / 210,000 = 1.
One? Yes. Integers always round down. So right now we're only going to halve the coin reward once. Once we hit 420,000, that becomes 2. That's "the halvening" event that everyone is waiting for. Moving on.
    // Force block reward to zero when right shift is undefined.
    if (halvings &gt;= 64)
        return 0;
halvings = 1, so we're not going to return 0 here.
    CAmount nSubsidy = 50 * COIN;
This value is not affected by any input and is still 5,000,000,000 satoshi. 
    // Subsidy is cut in half every 210,000 blocks which will occur approximately every 4 years.
    nSubsidy &gt;&gt;= halvings;
5,000,000,000 &gt;&gt; 1 is the same as 5,000,000,000 / 2 which is 2,500,000,000 satoshi =  25 bitcoin. 
Hope this helps make it clear.

Because contrary to what you may believe, there is no vast majority that wants a 2MB bump right now. It is the worst of the two proposed options (roadmap vs 2MB bump).

It can be, but it would most likely require a hard fork. A hard fork is a change that requires everyone to upgrade. Changing the divisibility of Bitcoin will have a significant impact on all wallet software out there. It's not something that would be done lightly. 
Currently, bitcoin is divisible down to 8 decimal places. At a value of $387 per bitcoin right now, that would mean that 0.00000001 bitcoin (called a satoshi) is worth $0.00000387. That's small enough granularity for a quite some time.

The technical reason is that they store the value as a 32 bit unsigned integer, which can be 4,294,967,295. Values in an LN transaction can be subdivided further than a satoshi (1,000 msat to 1 satoshi), so you end up with a max value of 0.04294976 bitcoin.

Fair enough.

The blockchain is an immutable record of transactions. That's its sole purpose. Immutability. Therefore, the blockchain is a settlement system. And that's fine. 
What happens with transactions before they are settled is not defined by the consensus rules, up until they are offered to be settled. That's why systems like Lightning can exist. They anchor in the chain, and then they can do what they want up until they close out their channels by settling in the blockchain. 
It's even possible to do stuff in this area that Bitcoin doesn't natively support, like sub-satoshi payments. All of that works up until you want to settle, at which point you have to round to the closest satoshi.

Your transaction is 1631 bytes. You paid a fee of 0.0002 bitcoin, which is 20,000 satoshi. 20000 / 1631 = 12 satoshi per byte. If you look at the link that posted, ( that puts you in the 11-20 scale. Everything below that from 31-151+ satoshi has a higher priority than you. 
The problem is your wallet. It doesn't have dynamic fee estimation code, or if it does, very poor code.

The logic is that having smaller blocks will allow more people to run nodes. Ultimately that could very well happen when SCHNORR and MAST hit (TX size reductions) and LN takes off (less on-chain TXes). Honestly that would be a good day. More economic activity while consuming less network resources.

You don’t understand how mesh networks work. Funds will be moving through many nodes in different directions even if the end destination is the same. 
On top of that, a coffee shop isn’t going to be the end point of the transaction when you buy a coffee. Most likely it’s a payment processor or an exchange in which case those funds will be moving to and from those nodes constantly. 
Channel balancing is another thing that will affect the route of payments where moving funds from A to B is cheaper than from B to A because of an imbalanced channel. This will happen deeper into the route, something you won’t even see.

And this ignores optimizations currently in the works. SCHNORR will make transactions even smaller, MAST will too and, hopefully, we will be able to fold all signatures into a single signature per block which will be a significant space saving. Would be interesting to redo that little bit of math up there by that time.

That's a matter of interpretation. If you think that every transaction sent out over the network is a legitimate honest-to-god-I'm-trying-to-send-some-money transaction then yes it may seem to be congested. However, the burstiness of those low fee transactions at critical moments is just too suspect. And that's ignoring the announced "stress-tests". If you ignore those, then the network has quite a bit of capacity left and segwit is right around the corner. So really, it's not that big of a deal as some try to make you believe.

Most soft forks took several months to activate. I'm not sure if we'll reach 95%, but that is only relevant for the current implementation of the soft fork activation mechanic. This could always be modified in a following version to reduce the requirements / extend the window. Ideally we reach 95%, but 80% or 75% would work just as well. 
The Chinese currently hold the majority of hashing power. You can see the distribution [here]( I can see 6 Chinese pools holding ~65% hashing power right now (AntPool, F2Pool, BTCC Pool, BW.COM, HaoBTC, ViaBTC).

Segwit does scale bitcoin though and not just linearly. 
- It makes processing of transactions faster since it fixes the quadratic processing of signature verification. 
- It offers incentives for people to reduce UTXO bloat by making spending of outputs cheaper (75% discount on the witness data). UTXO size is one of the bigger issues left that still needs fixing.
- It introduces the possibility of new security models that allow nodes to do partial download / validation of witness data (but needs protocol additions to do partial download).
@_date: 2016-11-26 04:47:38
No. Segwit is a set of new rules for Bitcoin. Currently, miners are voting on enabling it or not. If it is enabled, all miners will have to follow the new rules. If not then nothing happens. Users on the other hand will not have to do anything if they don't want to. For them, the new segwit rules are backwards compatible. 
Segwit activates when a 95% threshold is reached. that means that 95% of the available mining power supports the new rules. That also means that only 5% doesn't. That 5% would suffer a 20 fold increase in block generation time if they were to continue mining old blocks. That chain would not grow very fast. And since the new rules are backwards compatible, everyone on the system will simply accept the faster growing segwit chain. 
@_date: 2016-12-01 05:03:24

Just the block with witness data in it.
Segwit nodes will serve segwit blocks and regular, stripped down blocks, but they will only download segwit blocks from peers that serve them.
@_date: 2016-11-26 21:53:18
All known LN implementations aim to be compatible with each other, so there is no "LN X" or "LN Y". Second, the connections between LN nodes are private to those nodes, yet can be used to route payments between others if those nodes chose to make those connections available for that. You can connect to anyone who is willing to set up a channel with you. No permission necessary at all. At the transaction level, it's basically a mesh network of bidirectional payment channels. There is then a routing protocol layered on top to move funds between parties that are not directly connected to each other. 
Coins can't be stolen since you always sign off on the state changes in the channel. Nothing changes without your consent. If, however, the other party in the channel were to try and publish and older version of the channel state (where he had more coins on his side of the channel), that transaction exposes him to you being able to confiscate all coins in the channel. 
So it's basically set up as: We will transact according to the rules we agree upon and if either party tries to roll back any transactions that happened, they will lose all their funds in that channel to the other party. 
@_date: 2016-11-29 13:58:37

LN transactions don't need confirmations. They are instant since both parties sign off on the transaction (channel update). This also applies if you don't have a direct connection to the merchant, but *can* route to him through the LN network. The only caveat is if you have to open a channel to a merchant, which means you have to settle your channel open on chain, but even then that's also a 2 party transaction, so should be ok.

Yes, that's exactly what I'm disputing. The soft fork case has more benefits than the hard fork case. It allows for simpler implementations in new security models. 


No, that's not what proponents of a soft fork are saying. They are saying that a soft fork roll out is tried and tested and doesn't require upgrading by everyone at the same time, which is the big issue with a hard fork. In the hard fork case, everyone has to switch on a flag day or they are left behind.

If a transaction changes, the merkle root changes (and thus the block hash changes). 
The nonce is just a random number. It has no other function than to be changed during the mining process.

The only difference with SegWit as a hardfork and SegWit as a soft fork is where the SegWit merkle root is stored. In the soft fork, it's stored in the coinbase transaction. In a hard fork, it's integrated into the merkle root. The down side of the hard fork way is that you now require extra data to compute the correctness of the merkle root (when taking performance optimizations into account such as no verification of witness data), which isn't the case with the soft fork solution.

The main reason for my comment was to bring attention to the fact that Satoshi never stated why he introduced the limit and that people should stop attributing that quote to him. 
I'm not disputing that he mentioned a way to increase the limit but we now know that it is not as simple as the code he quoted (quadratic signature verification time comes to mind). Turns out Satoshi didn't know everything and there are more issues preventing a simple increase like he stated, some of which have been fixed, others that need more work. 
My personal opinion is that the integrity of the network is more important than increasing the block size given the small return in capacity increase versus the increased cost of operating a node and other risks. 
Segwit actually attempts to address some of those risks like sig validation, in addition to a number of other features, which greatly increases the value proposition, but even then, it couldn't have been rolled out before compact blocks was introduced. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 03:41:19

Not finding. Proving that a transaction is in the block. All that requires is the header + the merkle branch to the transaction + the transaction itself. A client can then verify that the transaction is hashed into the merkle tree. 
The branch is the hashes from the transaction up to the root. Every step up, 2 hashes are hashed together, so if you give a client the transaction and the hash of the neighboring transaction, it can calculate the next step up. If you then provide the second half of that pair, it can calculate the next step up and so forth, until you get to the root.

Not all cases, no. 3rd party malleability can most likely be solved, but there's nothing stopping you from sending out the same transaction multiple times with different signatures (all of which are valid). 
This last case is not a problem for segwit (if you only change the signatures), since the signatures are part of the witness data. They don't affect the rest of the transaction, so that hash stays the same.
Now if you start reordering inputs or outputs, then you will end up with a different transaction. That's a lot harder to address in both cases though. This is only possible in transactions that you fully create yourself, and wouldn't affect things like LN since those transactions are signed by two parties.

Yes, that's the point. Because being able to inflate blocks without cost benefits the larger miners and disadvantages smaller ones. So there needs to be a cost associated, otherwise blocks can be inflated to the point that smaller miners can't compete anymore.

- Source is controlled by the Ethereum foundation;

- They forced a hardfork to recover stolen funds (ignoring the "code is law" statements the DAO developers made. Code was apparently not law).

Depends. You can go for a payment processor that handles everything for you like they do with regular bitcoin transactions right now, or you could host your own. There are pros and cons to both. 
In the LN case you'd have to keep bitcoins locked in channels online so that's a risk over what is possible now to receive coins (where you can use bip 32 public derivation instead). Then again, once you receive an LN payment, it doesn't need confirmations like regular transactions do. So it's a bit of a toss up. You don't have to keep the LN node on your web server though. It can be any internet connected machine you want.

Lock-in means it has reached +95% of the required blocks signalling for Segwit in a 2016 block period. That means that after the NEXT period of 2016 (~2 weeks), all Segwit enabled nodes will activate their segwit code and start forwarding Segwit transactions.

Having the roots of the transactions and witness data separated means you can still verify the block proper and ignore the witness data entirely. If the witness root is part of the transaction merkle tree then that means you have to take it into account somehow (either it's now part of the download of the block, which will require another change to the protocol, or you have to compute it yourself from the witness data that you now also have to download.)

One of the biggest issues with larger blocks is block propagation. The time it takes to receive and verify a block has to be as short as possible. If it takes too long then the chance that another block is found becomes higher and higher. 
This is expected to a certain degree, but starts to hurt if it happens more often. The hashing power that found the discarded block is effectively wasted, which means it isn't counted in the overall hashing power of the network. We lose security this way (difficulty will ramp down) and miners lose income.
Further, if miners start building on separate blocks, we fork.  This also already happens from time to time, but a 1 or 2 block fork is not too bad, but these forks get longer if propagation time becomes longer. And there is a point where we lose consensus altogether.
On top of that, the Internet isn't some homogenous network where everything is sent and received at the same speed. The differences between minimum and maximum speeds is vast. One culprit is the Great Firewall of China. Over 60% of the Bitcoin network's hashing power sits behind that bottleneck. The miners there were already doing dangerous things to combat their propagation issues and were a big source of headache with the last softfork. 
Making blocks bigger right now will only make those problems worse. There are a lot of things that have to be done, many already in the works, before blocks can become bigger.
Hope that makes sense.

A lot of things in a blockchain based currency make no sense if the blockchain is private and between parties that already trust each other. Proof of work is no use. so that's out the window, issuing schedule makes no sense, since all tokens need to be accounted for. blocks make no more sense since you're not producing proof of work.

There are optimizations possible to make channel open and close transactions more efficient.

A side chain isn't going to solve it. Anything that requires storing 256,000 transactions / sec on disk is not going to work. LN type systems will give us unlimited transactions / sec because they are local (just between the interested parties and not the whole network) and ephemeral. They're not stored, only the start and end state is. And optimizing the start / end state transactions like the channel factory proposal is, where the on-chain pressure is lowered, will be the biggest focus. MAST and SCHNORR complement this as well.

Web wallets are "hot wallets" (the keys are stored on a computer connected to the internet). There have been many, many, many thefts of funds stored in online wallets. Hardware wallets are "cold wallets" the keys are not stored on a computer connected to the internet, they are stored in a purpose built dongle that's only connected to a computer for very short periods of time. Also, the communication protocol over the USB cable doesn't allow anyone to extract the keys from it. All cryptographic operations such as signing transactions or signing messages are done on the device itself. 
If your web wallet funds are stolen, there's no recourse. If your trezor stops working, you still have your seed words to restore your wallet.

Yes, it's basically a man in the middle attack, replacing the address you're trying to send bitcoins to with an address that belongs to the attacker.

No, the model tells you how changes affect your min spec. You simulate (ideally, you'd benchmark) your changes, feed it through the model and then using the results show what the impact is on min spec. 
For example:
"Change X reduces bandwidth by Y%, but increases memory requirements by Z%. We're still under budget on memory, so it's a safe change to make, anyone else's changes affected by a memory increase?" It gives you a more complete picture of what the impact is of a change. 
@_date: 2015-07-02 20:37:27
Not just the numbers, but also a model that allows us to benchmark any changes to Bitcoin Core and how they affect those numbers. 
For example, network I/O isn't simply blocksize / 10 minutes -&gt; bps. It's more subtle than that. It's basically tied to the measured orphan rate, where some percentage is deemed acceptable and using that metric you can basically work backwards. X seconds of delay is deemed acceptable, which gives you X = Y transmission seconds + Z verification seconds. 
Bandwidth is basically computed from that Y number and MIPS is affected by Z. 
And if that model is insufficient, we can expand on it and combine other factors as well. The better the model, the better the min spec  approximates reality and the higher the confidence in the impact of proposed changes.

They can't add transactions because they don't know which transactions in their mempool are already in the previously mined blocks. You can't add transactions to a block after you've posted the block, because that would invalidate the proof of work.

I still think this has to be optimized further. Even on an i3, the time it takes to validate and connect the tip should not be expressed in seconds for single digit block sizes. To loop back to my min-spec suggestion, this operation would be way above budget.

Don’t get me wrong, I fully expect this rally to end some time soon, but it needs a trigger. 
As I see it, the number one risk to Bitcoin is the Chinese govt seizing mining hardware. That would put quite a dent in the price. 
S2X is also a risk, but depending on how stupid exchanges are (tricking users in to selling the wrong coins) I don’t know how much. My guess is most people will dump those 2X coins as fast as possible for bitcoin, so that would only create more demand.

You're right, which is why I suggested we work backwards from what Bitcoin Core requires today and start from there.


That's fine, but there exists a bare minimum specification that can handle Bitcoin Core as it exists today and locking in on that configuration as a baseline to work from benefits everyone. It benefits developers because they can express the impact of their proposed changes in hard numbers and it benefits node operators because they will know how well their setup stacks up to the bare minimum requirements to run a full node and in the future they can even make a fairly educated guess when their setup will be insufficient to run Bitcoin Core at full capacity / actual capacity, etc.

SPV wallets still validate all the block headers, correct? Maybe I'm not understanding it properly, but once 950 out of the last 1001 are v3, v2 should be ignored, right? 
Edit: ok, I see what you're getting at. We're talking about two different things. One is the switch over to v3 blocks, which SPV could catch, and the other, which you're talking about, is the very real chance of a completely bogus block reaching 6+ confirmations that SPV can't detect as being invalid.

There is nothing stopping us from adding a number of extra bits of precision to increase divisibility, but that would have to be done in a hard fork most likely. Lightning already does it internally (it uses millisatoshi, 1000^th of a satoshi).

Luck of the draw. There is no magic bullet to mining blocks faster other than hashing power.
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:15:55
The Bitcoin network self regulates the generation of new blocks to be about an average of 1 new block every 10 minutes. This readjustment is done by changing the mining difficulty once every 2016 blocks. 
The number of transactions per block depends on the size of the transactions, how many transactions are available to mine and how many a miner is willing to put into a block. This number varies wildly.

It's not a hard fork because all older nodes still consider the new blocks valid. 
Simple rule of thumb: More restrictions -&gt; soft fork. Less restrictions -&gt; hard fork. 
In other words, if old nodes agree with the content of a block, even if it has more rules, then it's a soft fork. If the new block relaxes existing rules, older nodes will object and not accept the block.
@_date: 2015-07-09 17:01:51
The problem is the great firewall bottleneck to China and the incredibly irresponsible hacks that miners with over 50% of the total hashing power have implemented to get around that problem. They were (maybe even are) mining on top of unverified blocks. That's what economic incentives forced them to do. Hopefully an effort is underway to show them the error of their ways and how they can prevent the same issues in the future. Until then it's probably not in anyone's best interest to exacerbate the problem by increasing the block size.
Edit: On top of that, the propagation speed of blocks is also of vital importance. Validation currently needs a lot of optimization. is currently profiling the validation part. Go read his blog posts.

You're right, they don't. Bitcoin development is a meritocracy, where the most skilled contributors wield the most influence. This is a Good Thing. 
When you fork of to a new codebase with new developers, you hit the reset button on that model. You're losing a lot of expertise and you jeopardize the integrity of the system.


The simple reality is that the people that contribute the best code win out. There's no conspiracy here. The lead maintainer doesn't work for Blockstream, neither do other big names like Peter Todd, who, incidentally, can be a major pain in the ass, for all the right reasons. Even he signed the Core scalability roadmap. 


With competing consensus rules, the network will fall apart. The devs that moved away from Core and went on to do their own fork, trying to overtake it aren't helping Bitcoin in any way. When the majority of developers object to your proposals, you *concede* and accept that maybe, *just maybe* you're wrong. 
@_date: 2016-02-11 07:33:25


I think this is a reasonable request.
Edit: Actually, I think that *more* communication between miners and Bitcoin businesses on the developer lists would be a big step forward. We need more involvement from them. Either through discussion of needs and wants or through contribution of developers or funds to support more developers. Fantastic things are just on the horizon, more people makes us get there faster.

[The report]( references [another report]( for the definition of wallet provider. Here's a snippet:


participation in a virtual currency system by allowing users, exchangers, and merchants to more
easily conduct the virtual currency transactions. The wallet provider maintains the customer’s
virtual currency balance and generally also provides storage and transaction security.
The whole section is a little bit muddy, because they switch back and forth between 'wallet provider' and 'wallet'. 
Although it doesn't clearly state that there is a custodial relationship between customers and wallet providers, that would most likely be one of the deciding traits for requiring AML/KYC, since responsibility for funds lies with the wallet provider in that case as opposed with a regular wallet where it lies with the customer himself. 
But strictly speaking, there was no clear statement on it. And that may also be the reason why “The Commission will also examine whether to include virtual currency 'wallet providers'.”

Huh? Where did you read that? Are you referring to not reusing addresses? Because resigning transactions is something completely different. In fact, payment channels and Lightning will be doing a *lot* of this.


It's miner policy. Policy is unenforceable. So no, it's not "fundamental". 


'RBFing' confirmed transactions would mean they'd have to ignore a whole block of transactions, including the block reward (if it's their own block). The incentive would have to be *huge*. And that goes for all transactions, because once a transaction is in a block, it doesn't matter if it was RBF or not.


CPFP requires another transaction, RBF does not.


*All* 0-conf transactions allow "take backs".


This goes for *all* 0-conf transactions. RBF is the easiest one to detect out of all the possible risk factors of 0-conf.


CPFP requires extra transactions, with more fees.

Ignoring the fact that Core is decentralized (many parties working together to achieve a common goal), the decentralization that Classic proposes is to determine direction by popular vote. Any topic can be brought up. Anyone can vote, all votes are equal. The vote of a Bitcoin newbie weighs the same as a veteran developer. 
Now here's the rub. Any checks and balances on this approach are centralization efforts. Arguments like "of course we're not just going to let anything get in if it's a threat to Bitcoin" are a direct contradiction of the above mission statement. 
All of that also completely ignores the fact that the Toomim bro's control the voting platform.

It's a little bit more nuanced than that. You do have to [account for the actions of others]( in order to come to a stable operating environment. In short, you don't operate in a vacuum and should acknowledge that and act accordingly. At that point it's not purely self interest driving your actions.

Ultimately, demand for block space is essentially infinite, so there will always be a shortage, either at 1MB, 2MB, 50MB, 100MB, etc. This demand is tempered by pricing. Some use cases are best done in a layer on top, that limits their exposure to the blockchain (and its pricing). 
When it comes to fees, the block size doesn't matter much. What matters is, what is it worth to you, as a user, to transact on the Bitcoin blockchain.
Now that doesn't mean that the block size won't increase. It will, but only if the system can support the extra load without compromising on its core values.

No. You set up a 2 way channel between you and the other party. This means you both have to commit an amount of bitcoin to a transaction that is confirmed in the blockchain and then you can make instant 2 of 2 multi-sig transactions between the two of you that take in the output of that confirmed transaction. There is no risk of bitcoins not being there or bitcoins being double spent since both parties need to sign the transaction and it's spending coins confirmed in the blockchain that can only be spent by the two parties cooperating with each other.

@_date: 2015-07-31 05:37:06
I don't think it's a tragedy of the commons situation right now. It basically comes down to:
- The block reward completely eclipses the transaction fees so miners don't really care all that much right now;
- Miners don't have fine grained control over fees (with reasonable defaults) and how much they can delay transactions (they'd have to develop these from scratch themselves and some of them have demonstrated that they're not the best coders, see SPV mining);
- The block size cap is interfering with any kind of fee market, so as we reach capacity, it will devolve into a bidding war under the threat of exclusion rather than delaying transactions based on satoshi/kb rate.
@_date: 2016-02-02 01:56:27
If you're referring to Luke, he has a tendency to be short to his own detriment. His reasoning for smaller blocks now is because of orphan rates due to the health of the network *at this point in time*. If the block propagation bottlenecks have been addressed he has no problem with bigger blocks.

@_date: 2015-07-10 07:38:19
Regarding 2, there's a lot less of that going on than you might think. There's an incredible amount of noise in and that's certainly not helping. 
The block size issue is complex not because of the wildly differing opinions, but because there are still a big number of unknowns. 
The issue that came to light when BIP66 went active (the forking due to SPV mining) is a good example. It exposed a significant vulnerability in the way miners operate that was implemented because those miners weren't able to keep up with the chain tip. The time between a block being mined and them receiving and validating it was long enough to start hurting their bottom line. 
To be clear, that doesn't mean the block size shouldn't be increased eventually, but it does show that there are still a number of things that should be taken care of before such a move can be considered wise.
Another is the shining example is the 25 second validation time needed for those monster transactions that F2Pool is mining (to clean up the mined spam). Every node that receives that block, it's spending almost half a minute validating a single transaction before it even sends it on to the other nodes it's connected to. That has significant implications for block propagation. Yet another thing that needs to be addressed. 
Lastly (not really, but enough for this post), there's libsecp256k1. It will speed up signature validation, but you can't just roll that out willy nilly. You need to be 110% confident that you're not going to break either consensus or allow people to spend other peoples' coins. 
To top it all off, the effective block size (if you ignore all the spam) is around 300...400KB. Getting close to half full, but not really near any urgent levels.
So, if you ignore all the noise, it really comes down to optimization. Safeguarding Bitcoin's decentralized nature is in everybody's interest.  If that's been sufficiently addressed, then you can start thinking of ramping up the block size.

Separate relay networks, no idea, I'll take your word for it. But if the current p2p network is upgraded to use the smart relay that Matt wrote (in a similar way that thin blocks is being developed), the overall performance of long running nodes would increase significantly. Any data that can be propagated prior to finding a block is a win. Couple that with weak blocks and the efficiency goes up even further. 
@_date: 2016-02-29 21:03:27


Because you want coins that can't be traced back to you. The transaction graph in Bitcoin is open, so simply following the hops will lead them to you eventually. If you 'break' this chain, by taking someone else's bitcoins in return for yours, then they can't trace them back to you.
@_date: 2016-02-03 04:21:10
That's not even remotely true. Miners and full nodes all download the segwit data, so if you really want it that bad, so can you. And it only contains the INPUT scripts, nothing else. These are used to prove control of the transaction output it's trying to spend. The OUTPUTS are completely unaffected. On top of that, you choose if you want to use segwit when spending your coins, nobody else.
@_date: 2016-02-05 03:00:50
Well, let's put it this way, sidechains are not pitched as a scalability solution, and the reasons for that are quite evident (as I mentioned above and in the posts I linked). 
As for Lightning, it is an [open protocol]( developed by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja, neither of which work for Blockstream. They have their own implementation in the works [here]( and Blockstream is working on an alternate (but compatible) implementation [here]( So even that wouldn't be a sound source of revenue for them. So I'm still not seeing where the conflict of interest is. 
Segwit is an upgrade to the Bitcoin protocol itself, that solves a number of problems, such as 3^rd party malleability and O(N^2 ) signature validation, adds a number of new features and as a side effect allows more transactions in a block. Even though it comes from Blockstream, it isn't a source of revenue (not even sure how you'd even do that to be honest).

1. Lightning network is built on top of bitcoin. It uses regular bitcoin transactions, but updates them before they are actually committed to the bitcoin blockchain. Side chains are separate blockchains that are linked to bitcoin. You can send bitcoin over to the side chain and transact there in transactions that are only recorded on the side chain and you can then send your bitcoins back to the bitcoin network. This is done through a two way pegging mechanism where bitcoins are suspended on the bitcoin blockchain and new coins are created on the side chain. When you send them back to the bitcoin side, the side  chain coins are destroyed and the bitcoins are released on the bitcoin blockchain.
2. Existing alts (like litecoin or dogecoin) can't integrate with bitcoin through a side chain or lightning.

Of all the features that Lightning needs (for example), [Segregated witness]( is a collaboration between Eric Lombrozo, Johnson Lau and Pieter Wuille (Blockstream).

They're developed in collaboration with other developers, not working for Blockstream, or even completely by people not working for Blockstream. All I see above is Blockstream making valuable contributions to the Bitcoin system, with many more use cases than just the ones they want to use them for. 
To be honest, I'd rather see *more* involvement from other companies to improve Bitcoin, rather than less. BitPay used to employ Jeff Garzik, as far as I know that's the only Core Dev that worked for one of the more popular Bitcoin companies out there. There's no involvement from Coinbase, no involvement from Gemini, no involvement from Kraken, no involvement from Circle, no involvement (currently) from BitPay, no involvement from BitStamp...

Which interests would that be specifically though? How do they benefit from a constrained Bitcoin? 
Side chains doesn't solve scalability, so that's out. It's open source, so there's not much they can do to stop others spinning up their own side chain. In fact, that's exactly what [someone is working on right now](
Lightning [isn't even blockstream's idea]( let alone an income generator since it's being developed as a decentralized layer on top of Bitcoin. 
So yeah, I'd love to see some credible counter arguments how blockstream benefits from limiting Bitcoin.

Not sure if this is the case as that would make the feature a lot less useful.
@_date: 2016-02-06 09:43:32


The main issue is that new users of Bitcoin aren't well versed in securing their data. The number of attack surfaces that blockchain.info presents is significant. Things like email backups, dropbox backups, weak encryption passwords, losing identifiers. Any one of these things can result in a loss of funds. 
Newer generation BIP32 wallets (that blockchain.info only introduced a few days ago) are far safer, offer a one-time paper back-up, easy recovery process, don't require multiple passwords or identifiers and in the case of some, don't rely on a single 3^rd party to communicate to the Bitcoin network.
So yes, you can store significant funds on blockchain.info (you're lucky you weren't hit by the RNG bug a while ago!), I'd still highly advise against it.

Make sure they are aware that Bitcoin is a high-risk investment and that they shouldn't expect it to keep going up the way it has in the past year; that they should probably buy little bits at a time and expect to be in it for at least 5 years. If they come back with questions about alts, I give them my reasons why I'm not interested in them and that they've been warned should they proceed anyway.

You should always make a backup of your wallet.dat file! The blockchain is the historical transaction data. You don't really need to keep all of it. You can run your node in pruned mode. Check the command line options here:  You can also create a bitcoin.conf file with the options you want.
Ideally you wouldn't be running Core if you aren't planning on keeping the node up 24/7. You may want to look into a lighter client, like multibit HD or Electrum.

@_date: 2016-02-05 03:18:36


No thanks. I'd rather not trust a single entity with my Bitcoin transaction information.


Since the SPV wallet is the one making the outbound connections, you'd either have to somehow poison their address database or MITM them. Are there other attacks that I'm missing?


Do you have any sources for that? Mobile wallets on the whole don't request a lot of data, so I'm not really sure why node operators would want to ban them.


Agreed, it's not perfect (the false positive rate is client-side adjustable though, but it depends on the wallet implementation), until we have some compact form of UTXO commitments that make it efficient for SPV wallets to download and verify, privacy for SPV is tricky. Of all the options available, bloom filters are currently still the best (and that's sadly not saying much).

None of those quotes are incompatible with the success of Bitcoin. In fact, they depend on it. If Bitcoin were to fail, then any derived product will too. How would side chains even make sense if Bitcoin fails? They directly depend on the security of the Bitcoin blockchain.

We're not disagreeing here. I just think that there is a lot of cruft being included in the blocks that creates the wrong impression. Blocks are full, but a lot of it is junk.

That's **93** people. And only **7** of those [work for Blockstream]( 


RBF was proposed and developed by [David A. Harding and Peter Todd]( neither of whom work for Blockstream, please get your facts straight. 


A block size increase hasn't been rejected. A better, safer alternative was proposed that gave more than just a capacity bump, giving more time to develop scalability improvements such as weak blocks and IBLT, before an actual hard fork capacity increase would be needed. 


Me too, but it should be competition between ideas, judged by those that are *capable of doing so*. Not the unwashed masses that don't bother informing themselves and give preference to solutions that solve their immediate perceived problems instead of looking further into the future and choosing the path that will ultimately solve the problems for good. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 00:52:42
It also assumes that verification times are equal amongst miners, which isn't the case. There exists a block size at which miners with restricted bandwidth + verification time can never catch up to faster miners for which these limits lie higher.
@_date: 2016-02-02 08:30:45


Literally *nobody* in Bitcoin profits from a community in disarray. Nobody. Not blockstream, not anybody.


Yeah, terrible. Agreed, like those death threats that some Core developers have received. Terrible things have been done by both sides. 


Well, there's a sound technical reason for that. A core fork running on only 10% of the available hash power would be susceptible to attack by the other 90%. Changing the hashing algorithm would be the only protection against that. But yeah, it was probably a bit of sabre rattling. Still, Pieter Wuille was vehemently against it. 


This doesn't really follow. On chain, off chain, doesn't matter. They sell services, the first one being a side chain, but that's hardly a solid source of income. 


Let's not get into this debate. 0-conf isn't safe. That's the whole reason there's a block chain in the first place. And even then, the Lightning network isn't owned by anyone. It's openly being developed by multiple parties. Everyone can join in, open protocol and all that.


RBF was proposed and developed by [David A. Harding and Peter Todd]( neither of which work for Blockstream. So no, it's not really as clear as you think.

They have their own implementation written in Go in the works [here]( and Blockstream is working on a C implementation [here]( A Scala implementation of Lightning is being worked on [here]( and Java implementation (by blockchain.info) is available [here]( 
Transaction routing is currently being worked on and the simplest form (flood fill to find destination) is still more efficient than what Bitcoin currently does (flood filling the network for *every* transaction).
More efficient routing algorithms are being evaluated:
@_date: 2016-02-03 21:04:33
Bitcoin Core generates 100 addresses ahead of time. If you run out, it'll have to decrypt your wallet in order to generate new ones. I haven't personally experienced this, but it would most likely flush your wallet to disk once it generates a new set of 100 addresses.

Bitcoin development shouldn't be a competition, it should be a collaboration of all developers working together to make bitcoin as good as it can possibly be, while preserving its unique properties, such as its decentralized nature and censorship resistance. 
Once a minority group starts holding a popularity contest, you're undermining the very thing that bitcoin's development process is trying to accomplish: To let ideas that are good based on their own merit prevail versus going on a PR campaign and trying to wrest control over the protocol away from the development community under the pretense of "giving users what they want".
Current development practices also have champions of ideas, but they are presented to the people that are best equipped to make a sound judgment, whereas Classic's approach is to try and convince the unwashed masses and a number of key industry leaders. This is a Bad Thing. If the ideas can't stand up to scrutiny by the development community, they deserve to be discarded, regardless of what the user community wants. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 01:08:17
You need to send that block within a certain amount of time or the orphan rate (wasted blocks) will go up. When that happens, miners are wasting hashing power. Power that's not counted towards securing the blockchain. So we lose security. On top of that, the miners will try and solve this issue themselves (since they are losing income), sometimes to disastrous effect (SPV mining). 
So no, 256kpbs / connection is not enough. Far from it.

Liquid accelerates the inter-exchange movement of funds. They are all still separate entities with their own rules, licences, ins and outs.

Segwit transactions will have a discount on the segwit data of 75%. You could interpret that as having lower fees, or if you turn it around, pay the same fee, get higher priority. 


Currently the network can handle 3..7 tps sustained, depending on transaction sizes. With a 2MB blocksize that becomes 6..14. If you want to reach Visa average level of throughput which is ~2,000 tps, you would need to increase the block size by a factor of ~400. So you would need 400MB blocks to be able to match Visa on an average day, ignoring their peak, which is 56,000 tps (would result in a 11,200MB block size). The only way to handle those sizes would be in data centers. That's a terrible way to scale bitcoin. 
Lightning on the other hand has the potential to handle an unlimited number of transactions and would only have to settle on the blockchain periodically, which would be several orders of magnitude less than the number of transactions that LN processes. So even if you were to scale up to Visa level, the pressure on the blockchain would be significantly less. Granted, 1MB wouldn't be able to handle that, but it gives us a lot more time to scale Bitcoin to blocks that are reasonable for that future.

Every 10 minutes or so, a block of verified transactions is added to the bitcoin blockchain. The first transaction, called the coinbase transaction is a special transaction that assigns a block reward and the total amount of fees from the other transactions in the block to the miner that created the block. This reward started off at 50 bitcoin. Every 210,000 blocks (210,000 * 10 minutes is about 4 years), the reward is halved. So first it was 50, then 25 and now it's 12.5. Bitcoin can divide down to 8 decimal places, so after a number of halving it will go from 0.00000001 to 0 since it can't divide further than that. That will be around the year 2140. If you add up all the block rewards, 210,000 * 50 + 210,000 * 25 + ... etc, then you get just under 21 million bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-02-23 03:29:55
No, not at all. You don't need an arbitration system for the transactions that you aren't going to use it on. They simply aren't part of the transaction. At all. And for the ones where you *do* want to use one, you choose one that's cheap + reliable. For that *single* transaction alone. Since there's no lock in, those arbitrators will have to compete on price and reliability. 
There are tons of explanations out there on youtube that illustrate how these systems can work. You should take some time to educate yourself on the matter before jumping to conclusions.

The limit is removed and replaced with a block weight of 4,000,000. Witness data is still stored inside the transactions. Only when a **non-upgraded node** requests a block is the witness data stripped out of the block and the remaining transaction data is sent to that node. That data is less than 1MB. For all other nodes, the block size is now a maximum of 4,000,000 bytes.

In libsecp256k1 the field operations (nearest parallel, we don't use generic bignums) are augmented with proofs of correctness (e.g.  ) though only a small part of our provable correctness can be machine checked currently. Of course, correctness proofs are only one part of our strategy. Fortunately, because of the much smaller scope of libsecp256k1 we likely have an easier time hitting a higher level of assurance than OpenSSL does.

Because that's 8 seconds + validation time for 1 node, that then has to send it to 8 other nodes, and they send it to 8*8 other nodes, etc. Block propagation has to be fast, because if it isn't, miners will not be mining on the tip, but a parallel block, which is wasted effort, loss of income, loss of total hash power for the network. And if propagation gets really bad, the network can lose consensus all together.

You can also set maxmempool=XXX and maxorphantx=YYY to set it to only use XXXMB of memory for the mempool and YYYMB for the orphan transaction mempool (transactions that can't be linked to existing transactions known to your node).
Lastly, you can set maxuploadtarget=ZZZ to limit your upload target (coarsely) to ZZZMB per 24h. This is a soft limit and it will go over it, but it tries not to.
You can also enable [blocksonly]( mode (blocksonly=1). In that case your node only relays blocks, not transactions. This can save you up to 88% traffic. In this case you no longer care about the mempool and maxorphantx since they aren't used.
Edit: I would try and set prune as high as possible, so you're more use to nodes trying to catch up.

**Smallblockist vision of Bitcoin**
[Mission Statement](




- [Lightning](
- [Sidechains](
**Bigblockist vision of Bitcoin**
- [Gavin Andresen]( "there will be big companies spending lots of engineering dollars on their own highly optimized versions of bitcoin. I bet there will be alternative, secure-and-trusted, very-high-speed network connections between major bitcoin transaction processors. Maybe it will just be bitcoin transactions flying across the existing Visa/MasterCard/etc networks"
- [Gavin Andresen]( "I think long-term the chain will not be secured purely by proof-of-work. I think when the Bitcoin network was tiny running solely on people's home computers proof-of-work was the right way to secure the chain"
- [Gavin Andresen]( "bitcoin is already more decentralised than it needs to be"
- [Mike Hearn]( "probably 2 or 3 racks of machines"


These visions are incompatible. It's either we do all the transaction validation in datacenters, or we scale with intelligent software design.

Bitcoin's block size is a consensus rule. Changing that rule is as far away from "central planning" as you can get. 
@_date: 2016-02-02 08:10:38


Actually, it would most definitely push it in that direction, if it wasn't for the huge optimizations that were done recently. A LOT of work went into that and was years in development. The biggest one is libsecp256k1. With that, yes, we can scale up the blocks to 2MB or 4MB in the case of SegWit. But that's coming in 0.12. So no, it's not a "slow walk" it's careful and deliberate. Exactly the way you'd expect when you're trying to improve a system worth $6Bn. You can't just play it fast and loose, especially, as is the case with libsecp256k1, you're rewriting the core crypto code. These aren't easy things. You have to test, test and then test again and again. It *has* to be done *perfect* or the whole thing comes crashing down. 


And many years ago (actually, quite recently) if something doesn't make sense, it's not because they're stupid, or have different objectives, it's probably because I'm not properly informed.

You know what, you're absolutely right. We don't know which of those transactions are valuable or not. So how do you solve it. Simple. What's it worth to you to be included into the block? 0.0001 btc? 0.001 btc? more? That's right. Fees. :)




v 0.12.0 has better filtering in place, so that will be a lot harder this time around.


Nobody is denying that this would be a bad situation. I'm only arguing that we're far away from that point. 


If price was the only driving factor for using bitcoin, then sure. Those people will leave. But I hope we both agree that cheap transacting is one of the lesser reasons for using a censorship proof programmable global ledger that is currently secured by the biggest super computer mankind has ever seen, 3000 times stronger than the power of all the runner-ups combined.
Having said that, those same pressures apply to developers as well.  They can be seen as opportunities and efforts like Lightning only exist because of it. They offer a superior experience than regular Bitcoin transactions (especially the cluster-fuck known as 0-conf security), being instant, cheaper, *safer* and pretty much unbounded in volume.

I'm not arguing against the "original vision". I'm arguing against your assertion that "The blocks are full". A significant portion of that is junk.

You, as a node operator, are not a participant in the transaction, so you are *not* a user. There's nothing for you to opt in or out of. It doesn't concern you in the slightest. 
It's opt-in for the sender, and the recipient can trivially detect if it's being used and act accordingly. 
@_date: 2016-02-26 00:34:24
It was an example to illustrate that increasing the block size isn't going to make bitcoin scale while maintaining its unique properties. 
Whether the block size is 1MB or 2MB isn't really relevant. You get maybe a year of breathing room out of it and then it's full again. In any event, SegWit is coming soon. It'll help alleviate the pressure a bit, while offering many other features, followed by a possible fork next year.
The "fee market" as people call it is inevitable and is best established earlier rather than later for exactly the reasons people are complaining about it today. Why earlier? Less complaining people, and software can adapt to it earlier (fee estimation, tx rebroadcast, other smart solutions with locktimes, etc). 
@_date: 2016-02-05 01:24:22
Not the entire network, only the nodes you directly connect to. [Bloom filters]( are not perfect, but they are a lot better than the alternative of exclusively dealing with a single party like Blockchain.info and Mycelium too for that matter. Electrum also talks to a server to handle network access, but there are multiple servers up and running (though I don't think clients randomly connect to a different one every time) and you can setup your own if you wanted to.

I mean the ages of the coins spent in a block. Does the UTXO contain source block information? If it turns out that older coins are most likely not going to move, then perhaps it's possible to split the UTXO and keep those older coins on disk and only occasionaly taking the hit of having to go to disk to fetch it. This would both speed up UTXO access and reduce memory requirements. The big question is, how much and is it worth it?

Sidechains are not a scaling solution. Both miners and full nodes will have to download both the Bitcoin blockchain and the sidechain blocks in order to fully validate them and that actually makes it a worse solution than simply increasing the block size of Bitcoin itself.
Even Blockstream employees such as [maaku7]( [Pieter Wuille]( [Gregory Maxwell]( and other [Core devs]( admit as much themselves.
So no. You won't be pushed onto a side chain if bitcoin were to remain limited to 1MB, which incidentally isn't what anyone wants to begin with. Segwit pushes it up to an expected average of 1.6MB, with a cap of 4MB and once optimization efforts like thin / weak blocks and IBLT are deployed, a hard fork will most likely follow to make use of the extra capacity. 
Also, you claim that Liquid is closed source is false. It is based on Elements Alpha, which is available here: 
@_date: 2016-02-25 16:15:20
Oh, you want to argue that? The protocol messages are capped at 32MB since the very first version of Bitcoin, so a block couldn't be bigger than that. So yes. There was always a cap in place.

@_date: 2016-02-25 05:15:44
Block propagation times. If miners don't receive blocks in time, they are wasting time mining on an older block. 
If multiple blocks are found close together in time, only one of those will make it into the main chain. The others are discarded. This is wasted effort and there is even a chance that two chains are built up simultaneously, which would be a fork. 
These happen from time to time, 1 block forks, 2 blocks forks even, but if they get longer than that, then things start to go wrong. Transactions becoming unconfirmed because they were only included in one of the chains, transactions not propagating because they were spent from a chain that's not the main chain of a node forwarding them, etc. We could lose consensus all together.

No, I'm not deliberately misunderstanding. There's only one dominant set of consensus rules and the XT and Classic devs have decided that *that's* what they want to change. People will have to choose *wholesale* between either Core or Classic or we lose consensus on the network and people become vulnerable to all kinds of attacks. XT was fine when all it did was add some extra protocol messages and local policy changes. It became a whole different ballgame when it tried to change the consensus rules. The same goes for classic.

The way the current financial system implements it, yes. Arbitrated transactions in Bitcoin, not so. 2 of 3 multi-sig where sender, receiver and an independent arbitrator hold a key are vastly different. Arbitration fees would only apply if arbitration is needed (in the multi-sig case) and you get to choose the arbitrator every time. It's not "always on" as is currently the case and you're locked in to the arbitration rules set up by the provider of the financial service you're using (cc processor, bank, PayPal, etc).

No, it doesn't. In a side chain it doesn't matter if you send 1 block of X megabytes or X blocks of 1 megabyte. That's exactly the same thing. You're still sending X megabytes. In order to scale Bitcoin you need to take transactions off the blockchain. It will never be able to handle 7 billion peoples' coffee transactions, not even if you were to move them to a side chain. Lightning is designed to solve that exact problem by consolidating a large number of transactions into two transactions. One setup, one closure.

With a sliding window on the keys that are in the bloom filter, this is reasonably mitigated. As I said, including noise in the filter helps too, even if it's only a little. Look, I'm not trying to defend bloom filters, I'm only saying that they're better than the alternatives.


That's hardly a very successful sybil attack. 


We agree on that part. UTXO commitments will hopefully one day replace bloom filters. I hope that wallet developers will understand the urgency for that once they are finally introduced. They're still theoretical because of the computational and bandwidth requirements, but hopefully they'll be a reality "in the nearby future"^TM . :)

You're right, keeping a wallet.dat file safe and up-to-date takes discipline. It still presents less failure modes than blockchain.info though. I mentioned BIP 32 wallets with BIP 39 backup specifically, because those don't have that problem. 


It was. It was the best wallet out there at the time, but times have changed and technology has progressed. BIP 32 wallets with BIP 39 backup are considerably more secure than the wallet hosting solution that Blockchain.info presents.

One other change that's really cool but has *no* effect on users what so ever is [BIP 9]( which allows the rollout of up to 29 soft forks *at the same time*.

No, that's not what I'm saying. The point of having a baseline is to have a frame of reference. A measuring tool to assess the impact of proposed changes. A way to protect Bitcoin's decentralization. If you can't properly measure how a change affects the ability for people to run a full node, then you can't predict what will happen to the number of full nodes over time. 
If you read the post all the way to the end, you'd see that I also propose adjusting this min spec over time and not keeping it static. Technology progresses and so should the min spec. But until we've properly optimized Bitcoin Core (there's still a lot of low hanging fruit), then adjusting the min spec doesn't make much sense. 
And to further expand on that, I'm not implying that we should wait with increasing Bitcoin's capabilities until we've optimized it. Instead, if we've optimized it *sufficiently* to handle bigger loads, then we can increase those loads appropriately to still fit within the min spec.

Yes. But it basically comes down to the fact that bloom filtering is fundamentally broken from a privacy perspective. 
It's basically the same with 0-conf. Also an impossible problem to solve to a high level of certainty. What it comes down to is, both need to be fixed in other ways. Hopefully we can move away from bloom filters using UTXO commitments and 0-conf with solutions like Lightning. Those *actually* solve the problem. Bloom filtering and 0-conf risk mitigation techniques are both just hack jobs.

Maxwell mentioned in one of his video's that 2MB blocks would be fine with the optimizations made in 0.12. 
Segwit was preferred because it could be rolled out faster as a soft fork, would give more advantages and a similar capacity increase that would give more time to research and develop scaling solutions so that when a hard fork eventually is done, it can be longer term than just a simple 2MB bump.

Your balance is 0.5969858 and you want to send that exact amount, but below it, you've set a transaction fee of 0.0001 and a donation of 0.001. You have to subtract the transaction fee and the donation fee (0.001) from the amount you're trying to send.

It isn't a layer on top of Bitcoin. You aren't forced to used it. In fact, it's a closed service that runs between exchanges to accelerate the transfer of funds between them. It facilitates arbitrage, which has a positive effect on cross exchange pricing and liquidity. The only way for you to use it is if you have funds in exchange X that you want to quickly send to exchange Y. Before, this would take 6 confirmations. Now, it takes seconds.

There's some key differences between a regular robbery and a bitcoin robbery. In a regular robbery the robber will say: "Give me your money! If you don't, I'll shoot you and take your money anyway!" It doesn't matter to the robber which of the two outcomes you choose. He's going to own your money regardless. 
With a bitcoin robbery, the above no longer flies. The robber will say: "Give me your Phone / USB stick / whatever that contains your wallet.dat and give me the passphrase! If you don't I'll shoot you! And... eh... well.."
There are two key differences:
1. It's not a sure outcome for the robber, since he could end up with nothing if you tell him you'd rather die than let him have the money.
2. You have to give him the passphrase and there's no way he can find out that fast if it's the correct one. Sure he could type it in on your phone, or you could type it in, whatever. The thing is, it's going to take a significant amount of time for him to get what he wants. Valuable time where the robber is completely exposed.
So chances of success for the robber have dropped considerably and that will make them think before they go ahead and try something like this.

And therein lies the rub. If transactions now cost next to nothing and all of a sudden those costs rose astronomically to match the actual cost of block inclusion, that would feel more like a bait and switch than slowly ramping it up over time to acceptable levels. 
Like I said, block size isn't going to remain static forever (at least, I personally hope not), so that will obviously contribute to covering the cost of mining, but fees need to be in place from the start or it really is a bait and switch.

Interesting, If he's referring to Sidechains, they're not a scaling solution.

You don't transfer your funds to others when opening a channel on LN. You cooperatively lock funds in a transaction that can then only be spent if you and the counterparty both sign a spending transaction. The spending transaction has two outputs, one for you and one for the other party. By updating the balances of those two outputs, you are basically "sending" money back and forth between you and the other party. 


Yes, it's called Bitcoin.


LN doesn't have hubs. There may be a number of well connected nodes, but they're no different from other nodes. 
There's only one way to get Bitcoin onto LN and that's by opening a channel. You can't receive more than the total capacity of the channel. Rebalancing isn't necessary; just open a new channel. "Unbalanced" channels simply mean you can send / receive larger payments.

It downloads the entire chain, but will start pruning immediately.




The Bitcoin Core client has been faster than torrents for quite some time (since headers first download was available). Speeding up initial block download can be done by increasing the cache value in the settings (setting it to 4GB instead of 300MB helps a LOT).

You could kind of compare it to cash. You have to go to an atm to get cash (open a channel) and can only spend up to the amount you have, with the people you can reach (stores around you for cash, stores visible from your channel). 
But unlike cash, opening a channel doesn’t require you to go somewhere and you can open multiple to different parties (greater reach into the network).

A full node only helps if someone uses it to verify / transact with. Either directly or as a border node to the network. And that node is only secure if it runs on a machine that can be trusted to not be compromised. Cloud VM's therefore add very little to the network. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 03:55:48
TL;DR: smaller transactions, small privacy improvement. 
MAST lets the spending transaction cut out part of the script needed to validate it. Certain scripts have if/else sections which means that it can either execute the true path of that if, or the false path (else). The path that isn’t executed basically sits there wasting space. MAST lets you replace that part with a hash instead, making the transaction smaller and since it’s just a hash, it hides the code of that path, so observers can’t see what it would have evaluated if it took that other path.

Your idea doesn't work because Tx1 (between you and Alice) and Tx2 (between you and Bob) can't reference each other. 
Your third transaction would reference your outputs and create two new outputs, both of which can't be referenced by your original Alice and Bob transactions, since that would create a cycle. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:01:45
Just to write it out a bit more explicitly, here's what those two transactions look like:
Owner | Input | Output
Alice | TxId: 3b37ca75a128fe4ce67dc73fc74e4a9b068e88b855b2f6f5821db1ff166276bf, index 0, value 2.0 BTC | 1.0 BTC
You | TxId: 7d94a3ab5c938dfa625ee5f2c857eb7b2793a2c54f82cd4e44bc2ff23ef3863e, index 1, value 1.0 BTC | 2.0 BTC
Owner | Input | Output
Bob | TxId: e1e491eaa876284f1e3659349753a031d0f5cc3fb5fe7b1a96f854147db5136a, index 1, value 2.0 BTC | 0.0 BTC
You |  | 2.0 BTC
In order for you to create a new transaction, you have to take the transaction Id's of Tx1 and Tx2 and then create a new transaction, that creates two new outputs. You aren't altering the Alice and Bob transactions, just creating a new one. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 06:48:46


The hash computations that secure the Bitcoin blockchain are useless by design. If you were to replace them with calculations of value then those results could become worth more than solving a block, at which point all that computational power would be used to calculate those solutions and sell them, rather than publish them to secure the network. The Bitcoin network would come to a screeching halt.

They are not making these side chains "just in case". They are making these side chains because they want to offer features that Bitcoin doesn't support, such as confidential transactions (where the value transacted is not visible to people observing the block chain), or transacting other tokens than Bitcoin on the same chain.


I just gave you two, on top of showing you that the developers of these side chains have explicitly stated that they are not a scaling solution. So will you finally accept that or are you going to keep whining that they are for capacity increases?
@_date: 2018-02-27 22:13:02
You're trying to solve a problem that's easier solved by opening up some more channels (which is the whole point). The system kind of breaks down when you've only got a couple channels and nothing else. Yes, Alice now has an unspendable amount in her channel (since you have no capacity out), but that wouldn't be an issue if she had more channels to other people and not everything tied up in one channel.
Channel factories would make this more efficient, sure, but currently the software doesn't support it (it's still in development).

The side chains that Blockstream is developing are closed networks that they sell directly to businesses, so good luck trying to offload your transactions onto them! 
A far better scaling solution is the Lightning Network. An open source network that anyone can access and has even better security than Bitcoin proper. LN offers true secure instant transactions as opposed to the shoddy 0-conf that many businesses are accepting today. And it requires minimal storage on the Bitcoin block chain.

No, it's less than that. It's actually:
In hex: 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEBAAEDCE6AF48A03BBFD25E8CD0364141
In decimal:


It's not the number of public keys that's limited, it's *addresses*. That's because a public key is hashed with SHA256 and then hashed with RIPEMD160. That last one has a 160 bit output. So theoretically, there are private keys that will produce public keys that will hash to the same address. 
Chances of that happening are extremely small. 2^80 is equivalent to all the grains of sand on earth. And if you want that second 2^80, then imagine that all those grains are actually earth like planets and that all the grains of sand on those combined make up the total number of possible addresses. The chances of two people generating different private keys that will ultimately produce the same address is effectively zero.

Of course you can. Here's an example:

But that's the problem right there. You can't see if money went into or out of a mixing service. It's stupidly simple to camouflage any kind of detectable transaction patterns that mixing services have. Send the money in, and let small, random amounts bustle about for a week to zillions of different addresses and it's then sent to a list of addresses of your choosing.
Good luck tracking that.
Also, if the mixing site is on TOR, you're never going to be able to shut it down.

No. If law enforcement is after you, you'd buy a day tops with this. 
There is a solution to this 'problem' however. There are sites out there called bitcoin mixing sites. What you do is, you send bitcoins in, and then they come out the other end again, but in between, the transactions have been splintered up into tiny transactions and shuffled and swapped with transactions of other people. 
So when you send 1BTC in, it's broken down into small random parts, all of which have been targeted at other output transactions other than the one you entered. Your output transaction is then built up of small fractions of other input transactions. The result is that your actual transaction path has been completely broken.
Still, if you plan on doing something illegal, there are tons of other methods that law enforcement has at its disposal to eventually find you. The money trail may be untraceable, but any physical goods or services aren't.

It did drop below $2 on MtGox during the crash, but they rolled back those trades.
@_date: 2011-06-29 23:45:28
That's assuming you know both ends of the transaction.
Here's an example:
Someone is trying to blackmail you. They've got some dirt on you and demand you send X BTC to an address. The person receives the funds, sends it through a mixer in order to wash the funds and then stores them. Every time he wants to cash in some of those funds, he can take a portion, send it through the mixer again and then exchange it on an exchange for real cash. 
Also, there's nothing from stopping you from going through a mixer several times and destroying the intermediate wallet.dat after you've emptied it.
The problem with USD is that all bank traffic is logged and managing to make money disappear in that manner is really hard if you've never done something like that before. 
Cash has the added problem that it's a physical good, which makes it easy to track in the real world. If the blackmailer were to demand you drop $X somewhere, it's totally possible to just stake out that drop point and catch the person that picks it up. There are ways of course, but using bitcoin lowers the difficulty level considerably.
edit: another thing is, you don't see the money "vanish into the mixer" the only thing you'd see in the transaction log is that the money leaves that address and suddenly splinters up into a thousands of smaller amounts to other addresses. The trail ends there.

You can calculate this yourself by adding up 0.65% of the daily volume being traded on MtGox. 
The 30 day volume on MtGox was: 1,184,829.37 BTC, so their profit was 1,184,829.37 * 0.65% = 7,701.39091 BTC. That's 256.71303 per day. So in order for MtGox to recoup their 17K investment, you get: 17,000 / 256.71303 =  66.2218042 days.
@_date: 2011-06-09 07:37:18
Have a look at the bitcoin server side API's that are available. 
Also, right now I'd suggest tying into Mt.Gox to get the current excange, so you're getting your money's worth (and also not over charging).
Basically what you could do is create a new receive address for every transaction (what you should be doing anyway) and presenting that to the customer. "Please transfer the total amount of XX.XXXX BTC ($YY.YY at the current exchange rate)  to the following account: [account address] and upon verification of your payment we will ship your order."
Once the transaction (with correct amount) is sufficiently verified by the bitcoin network, you can send out your "Your payment has been received" email and continue normal operations from there.
It's not something thats' easy to set up yourself though, unless you're not afraid to spend time writing code.
Also, please realize that the value of bitcoin is in flux at the moment so there's no guarantee that 5 minutes after you've verified the payment, your bitcoins are worth $10 less than what you agreed upon with the customer.

That would be correct if it weren't for the fact that bitcoin is a *currency*. More and more businesses are accepting bitcoin as a payment method. It won't lose its value because there's a critical mass that is using it what it was meant for. Bitcoin has other properties, such as the maximum number of 21M bitcoins, the predictable rate of introduction of new bitcoins and distribution of new bitcoins that will ensure that the value of the bitcoin is more or less equal to the popularity of it. The result is that it's value will flatten out once it reaches maximum penetration, meaning it will fall in pace with population growth. And there's also the fact that real world currencies are inflationary. Net result is that bitcoin will gain value equal to the rate of inflation of real world currencies times the rate of global population growth.

you only need to make a backup of your wallet if you generated a new address. All transactions are in the blockchain and as soon as your client connects, it downloads all the blocks and plucks out your transactions.

The Nvidia 7xxx still had distinct vertex and pixel shaders. The Nvidia 8xxx was the first unified shader series they made. The pixel shaders aren't the ROP's you are talking about. 
The texture units are input units for the pixel shaders. They do the texture lookups and bi/tri linear filtering. 
The hardware that you're referring to that does the actual ROPing is located after the pixel shader pipeline. That's the blending pipeline that (optionally) blends the pixel shader result into the target frame buffer. They can also run faster if no pixel shader is specified (for clearing frame buffers and depth buffers).

As with every piece of software, bugs happen. But their "P2P" system still uses servers for the offline messaging part. Bitcoin's network doesn't work that way. There is no asymmetry. The worst thing that could happen is a client not being able to connect because it can't find other clients in the system. But you don't lose any transactions or validations, that's all taken care of in the network. The only thing that would happen is you wouldn't be able to pick up on those transactions or transmit new ones. In that case the solution is relatively easy: find another internet connection and try again.

The interesting thing about bitcoin exchanges is, there are several options to move money in / out of them, some of which have 0 fees. That's a super cheap way to move money from country A to country B.
Granted, the exchange from currency A to currency B incurs a trading fee, but that's negligible when you consider the fluctuations on the market. If you're not too pressed for time, you could probably negate those trade fees by calculating them into the sell prices when converting from BTC to currency B.
What's the difference you say? Well, 0.65% vs 2%+

Basically, yes. It's about the number of hashes per second that you can process, but if you join a pool, I think there's usually some sort of minimum speed requirement. You have to be able to process a range of fudge factors within a certain amount of time, or it's reissued to someone else. The work you did would be discarded (stale) and you don't get your share of the winnings.
Don't bother setting up a huge rig and doing solo mining. There's only a snowball's chance in hell that you're lucky enough to beat the rest of the bitcoin world to finding a fitting hash first.

Miners group unprocessed transactions together when they are generating a new block. They give preference to transactions that have fees associated with them, because that means they earn more money. The result is that transactions with a fee are processed faster than transactions without.
Right now these fees are pretty insignificant. It's not worth while to mine just for the fees. But the rewarded bitcoins per block (currently 50BTC) becomes less and less over time and the number of transactions per block will increase over time. 
The idea is that the transaction fee is slowly going to take over the role of bitcoin minting. So when we reach the 21M ceiling, the transaction fees combined will be worth the investment to the miners.

I wasn't replying to the OP, I was commenting more along the lines of banks not offering low cost / low volume international transfer methods. Now with bitcoin, it's possible to bridge the gap and go international, possibly at zero cost. 
0.65% market fluctuation is peanuts. Not even close to 'speculating'. 
But yes, introducing bitcoin into the current banking system would be redundant. Also, they optimize their inter-bank transactions to the absolute minimum. Say, Bank A sends $10 to bank B, and the same day Bank B sends $5 to bank A, then in actuality, only $5 goes from bank A to bank B and the banks pocket the saved exchange costs that they didn't incur.

Obfuscating bitcoin transactions in two easy steps:
1: Transfer bitcoins into MtGox or another exchange of your choosing.
2: Transfer them out again.
Most exchanges use a single wallet to send / receive btc to their users. You're not going to get btc's back from the same address you sent them to.
Edit: To clarify, the BTC you see in your MtGox account isn't actual BTC. Even during trading, not a single BTC is moving. Only when moving BTC into / out of MtGox do you see any kind of transactions in the blockchain. And since it's all one big pot, chances of you getting BTC back from the same address you sent them to are negligible.

* Transactions that haven't been put into a block are grouped together (plus a fudge factor) and a hash is generated. This hash has certain requirements. The number of leading zeroes in the hash sets the difficulty. The more zeroes required means the longer it takes to find a suitable fudge factor (some random data) in order to have those zeroes. This is where all the computing goes. It's called Proof of Work. It takes a lot of CPU/GPU power to find that fudge factor that produces a hash that meets the leading zero requirement.
* It's a SHA-256 hash function.
* All hashes take the same time on the same CPU whether it's the winning one or not. It's not super hard to compute, but you need to do this millions of times. Calculating one hash would take mere microseconds. That's the cool part of Proof of Work systems. Hard to generate, easy to verify.

Propagation of any data across the network can't be stopped if it is valid to other nodes. That would be a terrible thing. The only thing bip148 nodes can do is say "No, we don't accept blocks that don't signal BIP 141 after this date". At no point will bip148 nodes try to censor other nodes.

The complexity of the brain varies greatly over the different parts of it. The older parts are vastly more complex than the latest part, the neocortex. The neocortex is surprisingly regular. Simulating a single [cortical column]( is already [possible]( It's the fact that the human brain has about 2 million of these columns that poses the problem. You already need a super computer for a single cortical column, so you need almost 2 million of those to just simulate the human neocortex. That's not even counting the more complex systems below that.
So yes, the biggest issue isn't simulating specific parts of the human brain, it's having enough resources to simulate all of them at the same time, in realtime.

I understand that the goal is to get people to use Bitcoin as actual currency, but right now it's hard to actually spend them, because their value is increasing so rapidly (I mean, really, spend 10BTC on something worth $180 now and miss out on the rising value?) 
So until the market stabilizes, actual spending will be low. And in order to get the market to stabilize, you need more people on the system, but that creates demand and that jacks up the price. 
In other words, the system needs critical mass and that's what's happening right now. It's growing rapidly. When that settles down, the price will (hopefully) stabilize (after a drop that's hopefully not too big) and then normal usage commences.
This is going to take a long time. A year, maybe even more.
The main thing that needs to happen is get more people on the system and for that you need more adoption. As said by that Pirate Bay guy, we need better software. More entry points = more users.
The best thing would be if the Bitcoin devs would develop a core set of libraries and bindings for all the major programming languages out there so it's easy to incorporate into existing software and websites.

For one, I don't expect the same saving / spending patterns in bitcoin as you see with other currencies. But like I said, the net gain of holding on to bitcoins is minimal, not right now ofcourse, but when it finally reaches equilibrium. Even if this were to drive the value of bitcoin up more, that's not really an issue, since this too will plateau. There will be spending as the rise of btc won't be forever.

- Bitcoin is traded on exchanges just like other currencies, stocks and commodities - There's no guarantee that the price will go up / down / stay flat.

That's in place today. SPV clients download and validate the blockchain headers from genesis up to tip and receive filtered transactions that pass through a bloom filter along with a merkle branch to prove they are in the block.
There are still some problems though: 
* SPV clients can't validate the coinbase transaction because that requires validating all transactions in the block (at least their inputs and outputs), so SPV nodes can't tell if a miner is trying to generate more coins than the protocol allows. Also, blocks size can't be validated, among with all other transactions that you didn't receive. This is a reduced (chain)security model. Your SPV node is incapable of keeping the miners honest.
* Hostile nodes can withhold transactions from SPV nodes. There's currently no way to prove that you received all transactions you are interested in. 
* The current filtering method reduces privacy. Since the majority of transactions that you receive are meant for you, the serving node can associate those transactions with your ip / device.
These points have been brought up recently on the developer mailing list and I think that some people are actually working on solutions to at least the last two problems. I don't think it's really possible to solve the first one in any reasonable way without downloading full blocks.

I understand that bitcoin is currently going through a massive popularity spike. If it falls off, the value of bitcoin can drop, but it's pretty hard to make an accurate prediction about that. I fail to see what's inherently wrong with a deflationary currency, yet I'm pretty sure what's wrong with an inflationary one (save all you want, your money is losing value anyway).

Nodes enforcing network rules is only important if there's economic activity behind those nodes. Otherwise, why enforce the rules?
Miners use their own networks to propagate blocks, not the node network, so nodes not forwarding blocks isn't going to have any effect on the segwit chain becoming the largest chain. The point is to only transact on the segwit chain. If sufficient economic activity refuses to transact on the non segwit chain, the miners will be forced to switch to the segwit chain.

Do you think people would instantly lose confidence in Bitcoin at that point? Sure, if it would drop to $1, that would suck, but I think you'd have a hard time buying in at that price again, because it's going to skyrocket right back up. There's a lot of new people incoming right now, which is what's driving it up so fast. Some people with a lot of cash, some with a little. Over the long run it's not going to stay at $1 after such a crash. On the one hand, I hope it's not going to do that, but on the other.... man... buying in again below $10 would be AWESOME!

Your bitcoins aren't lost. If the transaction does not end up in a block, it will be 'forgotten' by the network. At that point your wallet will either forget it as well and you can spend your bitcoins again, or you're going to have to do a rescan. A rescan basically means it will throw away all your transaction data and churn through the blockchain again to find everything. It won't find the failed transaction and so you'll be able to spend those bitcoin again.

No it doesn't. Segwit with the witness hash in the coinbase transaction works *better* than if it's merged into the merkle root in the header (which is the only difference between a soft fork and hard fork version of segwit).

Changing the max block size is not trivial. A fix is needed for the quadratic hashing bug, a hard fork also needs replay protection and wipeout protection. All of these need implementations and testing before they can be rolled out. 
Segwit already gives 3.7MB. Significantly more than a 2MB hf would give. It's tested very extensively for over a year. It's already rolled out. All it needs is activation.  
Segwit also gives a soft fork way to add schnorr signature aggregation, which compresses transactions even further. 
Then there's MAST, which will compress transactions even more and increase their privacy too (partial script exposure at spend).
All of those things increase Bitcoin's on-chain capacity without requiring anyone to upgrade as opposed to a hf. 
And finally, flex cap proposals are being developed that can ultimately end this entire debate. But these need more time. Time that Segwit, Schnorr and MAST can give us.

Tor for SPV nodes maybe, although there are issues with that too where nefarious nodes are trying to get Tor exit nodes banned from the Bitcoin network. One simple way of doing that is [sending a bloom filter that's too large](

The Bitcoin network carries two types of data. Loose transactions and blocks that are bundles of confirmed transactions that are part of the global ledger (also called the blockchain). Your receiving wallet saw the loose transaction. Normally over a certain amount of time, the miners would have included your transaction into one of the blocks, but if you don't include a fee or if your inputs are quite young (or one of any other contributing factors), then it can take a longer time for this to happen. Some times (although this is very rare) it can even mean your transaction is simply thrown out.

Subspace doesn't use a blockchain to store data. It uses a distributed hash table and that hash table is modified all the time, new items being added, old ones being removed. It's more like newgroup servers with data retention policies, except the Subspace folks added a metric ton of encryption on top and made it one big query-able bucket of data instead of groups. :)

Arbitrage requires quite a bit of up front capital in order for it to earn you money. You need fiat + bitcoin in all the exchanges you want to perform arbitrage between (moving money is just too slow) and you have to keep track of all the different fees that can affect your profitability. Trade fees, transaction fees during deposit / withdrawal, etc. 
Arbitrage is good for the bitcoin economy since it provides liquidity and harmonizes pricing across multiple exchanges.

That's one problem. You're interpreting the private key as a string, when it's actually a byte array. It's going to convert the '8' to a byte, the '0', the '7', etc. This will give you the wrong byte array.  You're going to have to chop it up in bytes yourself. so your password will have to be 
byte[] password = ... where you initialize it with 0x80, 0x75, 0x42, etc.
Java's syntax to define a static array of bytes escapes me at the moment, but it shouldn't be too hard to figure that part out. Edit: [Java byte array](
At that point the md.update line becomes:




The result you're getting is a byte array that you can't just print out. Again, you're going to have to convert the bytes to text yourself. I don't know if Java has a built in function to convert bytes to hex or if you're going to have to write something for this yourself. Edit: [Java byte array to hex string](

I'm just browsing through your code and noticed a few things.
I noticed that you're deriving your keys in order, [here]( and [here]( and [aren't sorting the keys]( which makes your backup order dependent.
Also, I noticed that you're not using [BIP45]( for your multi-sig key paths (see [here]( and [here]( Is there a specific reason for this? 
Minor nitpick, why are you encoding the pubkeys with base 58 [during transport]( Those keys are never exposed to the user and don't have to be encoded in a readable form (I'm probably missing something).
I see that you're doing a [path query for a friend address]( when trying to create a transaction. Why not send friends an xpub triplet that they can derive endless keys from?
Also noticed that you're not clearing out sensitive data when you're done with it (good example is the hot and cold buffers used in [this]( function). Might want to have a look at that.
Edit: I also checked your [random generator]( used for [wallet creation]( Looks OK, but you're only using a single source of random values.

The two sets of words you had to write down + your account name + password + 2fa is to get back up and running should you lose your phone.

Having a 3^rd party handle one of the keys and limit spending is a security feature. If you don't want that, that's fine. Stick to any of the SPV wallets already out there. You're right that it comes at a cost to use a 3^rd party service.

It has to do with the signature encoding. There are two valid ways to express one signature.

Still the same signature, but when it comes to calculating the transaction ID, the content of your transaction has changed and so the ID will be different.

Namecoin is meant more as a public store of data a-la distributed DNS. Subspace is meant for encrypted asynchronous communication, like newsgroups or email, but faster and meant as a side channel to Bitcoin. 
Simple example: right now stealth addresses require extra data in a transaction so the recipient can generate the private key to spend the funds again. That data is currently embedded in an OP_RETURN output. With subspace, the sender can send that metadata along with a copy of the transaction over subspace instead, so that OP_RETURN output is no longer necessary.

The following is not how hashing works, but it's to explain to you what a simple rule can do to make the following task more difficult.
Let's say that you have to throw a die 100 times and the last one has to be a 6. The 99 initial ones are just a bunch of work you have to do in order to make the task more tedious. 
 If you fail, you have to throw it again 100 times, etc until the last one is a 6. Per throw sequence, the first 99 don't matter, but the last one does. So basically, you've got a 1 in 6 chance of getting it right.
Now, in order to increase the difficulty, the next time you have to throw the die 100 times, the last 2 have to be a 6. Now you've got a 1 in 36 chance of getting it right. So the average number of tries just went up drastically. Add to that that you have to do all that initial work in order to do those last couple throws, you're going to be busy for a long time.
The difference to hashing is that the initial 99 tries actually do matter. The hashing algorithm calculates a verifiable number that's easy to check, but due to the X number of zeroes requirement, extremely hard to find.

Those two things run in lock-step though. 
If the value of bitcoin were to drop drastically, say, below $1, then most miners would quit, since it's not worth their investment. The difficulty would throttle down, and the potential to manipulate the block-chain increases. At the same time, why would people go through all the trouble of trying to hack the block-chain in order to get bitcoins if they're only worth $1 a piece? 
It's an interesting bit of Game Theory. The easiest and most profitable action isn't to hack the block-chain, but to mine bitcoin.

The market doesn't really have a choice. It's not going to move either way. BIP148 looks like it won't succeed and neither will segwit2x or all those other non-Core efforts. Fact of the matter is, +95% of the nodes on the network run Core and that will most likely continue to stay that way.

By larger I mean more hashing power. Pretty much everything about a larger block takes longer. Transmission, verification, culling the mempool, etc. All that time the smaller miner can't mine at the top, unless he sacrifices security and fee income (start hashing an empty block on top of the unverified block). This has its own set of problems.
This video illustrates the problem quite eloquently: 
@_date: 2015-03-11 18:31:45
That's not true. Current block subsidy is not a hidden cost for transactions. It's Bitcoin's issuance schedule. You can't have Bitcoin without issuing the currency. The two are completely unrelated. Transaction fees aren't going to go up if the block subsidy goes down. We've seen that already. We're still on the same transaction fee schedule as when it was $1200 / btc. By the time the block subsidy goes down, the number of transactions will go up, not the fee.
@_date: 2017-07-10 11:18:52
No it doesn't. Empty blocks doesn't mean more people use bitcoin. The two have absolutely nothing to do with each other. Besides, it's unsustainable over the long term because the block subsidy will go away which means mining empty blocks would mean financial losses for smaller miners.

In the past, the fees were reduced every time the value of bitcoin went up significantly. From 0.001 to 0.0005 to 0.0001. The latest version of Bitcoin Core has a new fee system that tries to estimate an appropriate fee based on recent transactions and how fast they confirmed and will adjust the fee accordingly.

You won't get to mine on their chain. Because you weren't invited. That's the whole issue with those closed blockchains, they totally miss the point. Bitcoin is the way it is to enable two valuable properties: Nobody is in charge (decentralized) and everyone can join in and leave at will. 
Both of those two qualities are not what banks and other financial institutions want from a blockchain. They want to be in control and they want to exclude access.

**Edit: To be clear, these guys are up to no good an under no circumstance should we underestimate them. They've made themselves known, which is something we should be thankful for, but they will learn from their mistakes.**
They're not the smartest bunch though. If they wanted to do passive monitoring, they wouldn't be tarpitting nodes that connect to them. What I mean is, not only are they trying to get nodes to only connect to their own subnet, they don't feed any data either.
Second, those nodes also caused headaches for breadwallet users that couldn't send their transactions. So I don't know how they plan on monitoring and deanonymizing people when they are actively disrupting the network. 
Had their nodes acted more like traditional nodes, they would've been able to get away with this a lot longer.

I'll try to answer some of these questions. 


Ninki holds the 3^rd private key. You hold two. This means that you can always get your coins out with those two keys + the master public key that they sent you via email. One of the two keys that you hold goes into cold storage and the other one is kept encrypted both on your device ~~and on their servers~~. I checked some of the code (not all of it) but it looks like they never get access to the decrypted private key. 


Because letting a 3^rd party manage one of the 3 keys adds security in this case. It means that an attacker now has to compromise multiple targets to get at your coins.


This is the public side of the 3^rd key they hold. It doesn't matter if this is public. It's not sensitive (as in, someone can steal your coins). Worst case is someone can figure out which transactions are yours after you send them.


Not at all. You can't sign any transactions using a public key. Only with a private key. They are still a 'gatekeeper' so to speak (that is, unless you use your 2 keys to yank your bitcoins out). 


This is not true. 
Edit: correction.

This is misleading. The seed nodes are the bootstrap nodes. They are used to populate your node address database. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:10:39
Bitpay mentioned that they haven't sold a single bitcoin on an exchange in a long time. 
Even then, the transactions they receive from users are on the Bitcoin chain and when they move them on, they would have to move those coins onto the Liquid side chain, which needs to settle on the Bitcoin chain first, so they can't eliminate those transactions either. There's no savings for Bitpay. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 05:31:44
This does not help at all. The number of addresses is irrelevant. What matters is the number of inputs. Every transaction you receive creates an entry in the UTXO database for you. When you create a new transaction, your wallet will then pull in whatever number of UTXO entries it needs in order to satisfy the amount you are trying to spend. Again, regardless of which address(es) it was sent to. If it needs to pull in a lot of different outputs, then the size of the transaction will go up.

Not by much. The timestamp is used to calculate the new difficulty. It does this by taking the timestamps of the first and last block in the 2016 block range and calculating the new difficulty based on that. The biggest allowed difference is 2 hours, so on a 2 week scale, it won't affect the difficulty too much.

You're mixing up two things. Invertible bloom filters will make block propagation (not verification) constant time regardless of content and pruning is what a node can do to reduce disk space usage (by throwing out all blocks except for the last ~2000 or so).

There have been several proposals along those lines. The biggest issue with that system is that miners can bloat the blocks at little to no cost in order to push smaller miners off the network.

Even with smaller blocks, adoption will grow those blocks and then you start to get into trouble when block propagation and validation time starts to come close to the average block interval. You'll start to get more and more stale blocks and eventually the network will start to split, losing consensus.
And as I explained up top, there is hardly any benefit for the end users. Even if smaller blocks are easier for small miners, they still have to download and validate bigger blocks from bigger miners.
@_date: 2017-07-10 11:29:44
That doesn't work on spv nodes. They would have to download the entire block to know its size. Besides, that would make the point of mining empty blocks pointless from a network perspective. The network pays miners for security. If those blocks don't provide security they are pointless.

OP_RETURN's are pruned from the UTXO database. The unspent transaction outputs database. This is the working set that contains all possible outputs that can be spent. It's is basically a distillation of the entire blockchain. Any time an output is spent, it's pruned from the UTXO.
When people talk about pruning OP_RETURN's, it's because they provably can't be spent. [OP_RETURN always makes the script engine fail]( so it can't be spent, therefore, it doesn't have to be included in the UTXO. It's still recorded in the blockchain though, so it works perfectly fine as a data store.

TL;DR for people who don't want to read a wall of text:
The block hash of a name coin block (that does not satisfy the difficulty requirements) is included in the coin base transaction of a bitcoin block that *does* satisfy the difficulty requirements of the bitcoin network. 
So the bitcoin blockchain now has a reference to a block in the name coin blockchain. The name coin network accepts this as sufficient proof of work.

- People have a lot of misconceptions about where money derives its value from.
- It's not issued by a 'trusted party' like a government.

Any change to Bitcoin's consensus code is a hard fork. Changing the block size limit from 1MB to anything else is a hard fork since older nodes won't accept blocks that are bigger than 1MB. So you split the network. 
It takes time for everyone on the Bitcoin network to upgrade to a new version of whatever software they're running that checks those specific rules. Not all Bitcoin apps check the block size limit, but they do check other rules, etc.

Coin priority depends on things like the age of the coin, the number of coins and the fee. 
If you're going to start spamming the network with lots of transactions, you're going to end up with a lot of young coins, so then you're left with number of coins and fees. If you want lots of transactions, you're probably not going to have lots of coins per transaction, so then you're left with fees. And then it starts to get really expensive.

There's a project underway to develop a distributed "join market". Basically, you can offer your coins up for CoinJoin transactions and in doing so, earn some bitcoin. When constructing CoinJoin transactions, at no point do you ever hand over your coins to a 3^rd party, so there's no risk of anyone running off with your coins. If this market were to grow, you could leave a bot running and have it slowly earn you some extra bitcoin.
The obvious down side is, it is an attempt to obfuscate the origin of coins, so there's a chance you're joining with stolen coins or coins used for illicit activities. If you have no problem with that, then you might want to have a look at it.

I haven't found any blocks where this happened, but from what I understand there's a couple that are slightly less than what they should be. 
Mining only concerns itself with the reward of the current block, not with the total number. Then number 21M doesn't appear anywhere in the source code. It's simply a result of adding up all possible block rewards. 
We started out with a 50BTC block reward. After 210,000 blocks, that was halved to 25BTC. After another 210,000 blocks it will be halved again, all the way until we reach 0.00000001 BTC, or 1 satoshi. That's the lowest possible block reward. When that's halved, it'll become 0. So if you add up all those rewards, the total will be just a little bit under 21M BTC.

Lightning uses some of the newer instructions added to bitcoin (and depends on the new CSV opcode that has yet to activate). If any alt coins have those opcodes then there's not much from stopping anyone from porting Lightning to that chain. 
As for multi-chain, I'm not sure what you mean by that. If you mean cross-chain transactions then no. That doesn't work for any currently existing alt-coin. Side-chains however will most likely be able to support Lightning (if they have the prerequisite opcodes), but that kind of lies outside the scope of Lightning (the movement from Bitcoin to side-chain isn't covered by Lightning).

You'd be introducing a 3^rd party for very little benefit. SPV scales very well, even if we were to go to blocks that are orders of magnitude bigger than they are right now. Downloading the headers + merkle paths + your own transactions is sufficient to trust you received a payment. You can connect to any node on the Bitcoin network for this information instead of trusting a 3^rd party.
Trusting a 3^rd party would mean giving up your financial privacy, whereas using SPV means you can connect to any node on the network and even multiple to spread out queries for transactions.

Well then the same goes for bitcoin. I can send funds from one address to another and instantly resend them from there, with 0 confirmations. Since I own both addresses, I don't have to worry about double spends.
@_date: 2015-02-04 09:53:59
Sorry, your abbreviations are too abstract for me. I'll just tell you how it works instead. :)
A miner creates a block with a number of transactions in it and then calculates a double SHA-256 hash of the block header. That hash value is a 256 bit number. That number has to be less than a specified value (difficulty). If the hash fails that test, the miner tweaks a number in the block header (called the nonce - a "number used only once") and then calculates the hash again, again, again, etc until the hash passes the test.
This is a brute force function. Due to the preimage resistance of SHA-256, there is no faster way to find a hash that will pass the difficulty test. 
Verifying that the hash is correct is very cheap though. All you would have to do is hash the block header and do the test, since the tweaked number is already in there. 
The brute force part is very expensive to do, which is intentional. This ties into other aspects of the design, not really visible in bitcoin's code, but more into the game theory aspect of it. An attacker out for profit would earn more money contributing work to the network (and earning bitcoin) than to try and do a double spend attempt, which would yield a far lower reward for a much higher risk.

What I meant was, instead of doing it per transaction, why not encode a triplet 'root' in the contact info when it's pulled from the server? That way you have all transactions sent from A to B under one single root.

The above description is just a rough sketch of what could be built and it covers just the low hanging fruit. I'm positive that smarter people than me can come up with even more sophisticated use cases.
The reason I wrote out this idea is that we see a lot of innovation in a lot of areas, like key management (HD wallets, multi-sig), mining (ASICs), blockchain technology (alt coins, side chains), but hardly any in payment requests, an area that I think can have just as big an impact, maybe even bigger, than any of those other areas. 
Being able to forward payment requests and, as you say, split / combine them is something that's downright impossible with any payment systems that are popular today. 
Can you imagine a US website presenting you with a payment request to wire money to someone in China or Taiwan? You'd nope right out of there, right? With Bitcoin we can do exactly that and users would be none the wiser. 
Even end users could make use of a payment router some day. They'd probably not run it themselves (we probably would, but not the masses), and would just use some online service. You'd be able to enter your mortgage or rent, your phone bill, utility bill, car payments, your own wallet, savings, kids allowance, etc and have your salary sent to that router. Everything would be routed automatically, and maybe you'd even be able to prioritize which outputs must be filled first, etc. 
Endless possibilities. :)

Couple questions. Reading the description on github, I didn't see anything about a retention policy or the option for the receiver to delete a message from the server. 
Also, When 'buying tokens', I hope that this will become part of the protocol. Also, it would be cool if a challenge / response system, both crypto (pub key signing) and human (captcha for acct creation) was used to log into a server, instead of a username / password combo. It would be cool if this too was part of the protocol. It would be ideal if everything could be done from within whatever client you're running and not have to visit a website.
Some way of publishing fees / retention policy would be nice, but that's kind of meta, but could ideally be used to base server selection on in an automated way.

Bitcoin's message container format protects you against buffer overflows fairly well.

@_date: 2015-02-02 16:48:00


It's not entirely 'arbitrary'. The block height has to be included in the script. This is done mainly to prevent the transaction from getting the same hash as a previous coin base transaction, which has happened before (and as a result, makes the previous transaction outputs unspendable).


This is disputable. I would consider using signed integers for values a bug when only positive values are allowed. If bitcoin-qt used unsigned integers from the start, this bug would never have happened. 
It's disputable in a sense that reimplementing it with unsigned integers does not cause any over-the-wire protocol changes, but it's implemented (and described in the docs) as being signed integers.

Ok, here's how it works: person A in the US wants to send money to person B in Mexico. Person A goes to an abra teller in the us and exchanges cash for a digital version of that USD (this part is a bit fuzzy, it's not Bitcoin but it uses Bitcoin but it's leveraged yada yada vague). Person A then sends that USD equivalent to person B who then exchanges it to Mexican Pesos at a Mexican abra teller. Neither the US teller nor the Mexican teller directed any funds anywhere for anyone. Both exchange events were person to person exchanges. Abra's added value is the value stability (time limited) and their exchange network.

No. Say you are able to preimage an address, then all you'd have is a value that hashes to that address. It could be any value, but sure, let's say you could generate valid public key that hashes to that specific address. That's no different than a reused address (that already published its public key in a prior transaction). You still don't have the private key. You'd have to attack secp256k1 as well (to get the private key).

The entire network enforces the rules. You'd have to get everyone (or at least a big majority) on the network to run your version of the code in order to change those rules.
And you don't have to "copy the code". It's open source. You can download the code here: 
@_date: 2015-02-10 09:01:19
One of the down sides is that you'd be changing the issuance schedule, so you'd have to change that too.
Another one is that it would mean more stale blocks. More blocks will be found at the same time, only one of them will be part of the main chain, the rest will be wasted. 
And if you make the confirmation time even shorter, you risk of the network losing consensus all together. 
In any event, the block confirmation time hardly matters. Transactions propagate fairly quickly and once they reach a high enough penetration, the chances of a double spend decreases significantly. 
Also, in most cases, high speed transactions are typically small ($0.01 ... $2,000.00) and larger transactions usually don't need such fast confirmation ($2,000.00 ... whatever). 
Services like BitPay are very well connected to the Bitcoin network and monitor it quite closely for double spend attempts.

@_date: 2015-02-04 09:15:37
To add to this, you can even send multiple "inputs" from address 1,2,3 for example to multiple "outputs" on addresses 4,5,6. You add up the input values, say 7BTC, 8BTC, 9BTC, total 24BTC and then redistribute that to your outputs in any way you see fit. Any Bitcoin not assigned to an output (total output BTC &lt; input BTC) is collected as fee by the miner that includes your transaction in a block. 
The above is almost correct. You're not actually sending BTC from addresses, but you're redeeming transaction outputs for which you can prove ownership. Your transaction inputs reference the outputs to be redeemed and you then "solve" the cryptographic "puzzle" that proves you are the owner. Most times that's by providing a public key and a signature, but other times it's by providing multiple public keys and signatures.
I'll stop here for now. 
If you have more questions, shoot. :)
@_date: 2015-02-10 00:58:34
The reason there was a limit was to prevent a network attack in the form of "monster blocks". Basically, mining was so easy back then that anyone could generate a block and there was very little stopping them from creating GB+ blocks, which would either push out many miners or generally keep a lot of them busy verifying it. 
So a block limit of 1MB was imposed (huge at the time) and it was always intended to be bumped up higher when needed. The problem is, it's part of the consensus rules of the system. Any block larger than 1MB is going to be rejected, so now we've got the problem that we can't just willy nilly increase the block size. 
As you say, there isn't much reason for miners to create bigger blocks other than keeping the network running good enough that it does not affect the value of bitcoin, since it would obviously affect miners' income if they only generated blocks with a coinbase transaction in it and nothing else. Those bitcoins would become worthless since they wouldn't be able to move / sell them anyway.
So that scalability issue has to be fixed. Gavin's invertible bloom filters approach basically makes all block fixed size, regardless of what's in them, so mining a big block vs a small block is only limited by verification time and not propagation time. Verification time will be optimized too, once sipa's new secp256k1 ECDSA package is adopted into the rest of bitcoin and not only used for signing. Hopefully that will fix most scalability issues for bigger blocks and we can move ahead with Gavin's 20MB / double every 2 years block size proposal (or some form of it).

Do you have a source for this? As it stands, Bitcoin will stop minting new coins in 2140, or perhaps a little bit earlier, because of the steep rise in difficulty we saw the last 6 months. But it won't be anywhere near 2021.
Also, transaction fees. Coin creation tapers off to 0 very rapidly at first, but more slowly towards the end (in absolute terms that is, it'll halve every ~4 years).
So when coin minting tapers down, transaction fees will become more significant.

I think all the bitcoin miners will tell those politicians to go fuck themselves. Transaction fees are subject to market forces and nothing else. Miners sort transactions based on priority (which is affected by age, amount, fee, etc) and will include X of those into a new block. That X number is subject to block propagation times or better said, the chance that their block reaches other miners fast enough so they don't risk losing out to someone with a smaller block.
Miners have every incentive to invest in R&amp;D because it increases their chance to generate more blocks (= more income). Resorting to fear mongering makes absolutely no sense because it will negatively affect their bottom line. Same goes for not including free transactions. As soon as they all start doing that, bitcoin will lose value (no more free transactions, aaah!) and it will impact their bottom line.
They can try to force people to pay more transaction fees, but there will always be miners willing to pick up the slack and walk away with the lower fees.

Because you invest according to risk. When Bitcoin was less than a dollar a coin there were very few users, no regulations at all, very real chance that Governments could have reacted badly, technical treats that could have killed it, the list goes on. Some people threw caution to the wind and it paid off big for them, but it could have just as easily gone the other way. 
As for buying at hundreds of dollars per coin, it's a lot safer now (yeah, sounds crazy, right?) than it was back then and a far better store of value even with those big price swings. The swings are decreasing though and it wouldn't surprise me if the bubbles end up diminishing as well. I'm fine with that. Give me a Bitcoin that's stable in price that outgrows inflation and I'm happy. Won't happen though. Far too much innovation going on that keeps on adding function and value to this coin.

Not to refute your assertion that capacity should eventually be increased...


These statements seem to contradict themselves. One-time large transactions by their very nature are less frequent than smaller payments that are more suitable for LN. Therefore the amount of space saving due to LN will be significant versus the incidental large value transaction you would do. 
Even then, resettlement of your LN channels is something that is being investigated / developed that should make it easier for you to move funds into / out of / between channels, making it less of a hassle to use. 
Lastly, I'm not sure if this is in development yet, but multi party channels were mentioned as well, where you could transact between 3+ parties in a single channel. This would remove even more friction when using LN.

This isn't correct. The Merkle tree *proves* that transactions belong to the block, it doesn't store it. The block header contains the Merkle root, and the leaves of the tree are the hashes of the transactions. These transaction hashes are hashed together in pairs. If there is an uneven number of transactions, the last one is hashed twice. This halves the number of result hashes. Let's start at 100 transactions.
100 transactions, becomes 50 pairs, producing 50 new hashes. These hashes are then paired again, producing 25 hashes. You can't halve 25, so the last one is included twice, so you get 13 pairs, then 7, then 4, then 2, then 1, which is the root. 
In order to prove that your transaction, or balance was included in the tree, they can send you a *branch* of the tree. You can then independently verify that your hash contributed to producing the root hash.
You can trace your transaction hash through this tree, if you have all the second input values that produce the hash of the node above it. So say you have transaction  you were paired with 21, so they provide you with hash  and hash  Then, they provide you with the result of the hash of the one it was paired with, and you can hash that together with the result of the hash of  and  and that will give you the next value that can then be hashed together with the following piece of the branch they give you, all the way up to the root.
That's basically what SPV wallets do to verify that a transaction is part of a block. 
A slightly altered version of this can be used to prove that your funds are part of the published totals on the exchange. Instead of just hashing together a hash of a transaction, you could do that with a hash of some identifier of your account + the balance, where the balance is provided in clear text, then you get the hash of your pair + its balance (you can't identify the paired account because it's just a hash), and work your way up from there. The balances are also included in the hash upwards and the values are added and also passed upward, until you reach the root, where you have the total balance and the root hash.

A hash of a specific version of the transaction is signed, not the 'transaction hash' itself. We're clearly talking about two separate things. 
Even if SHA256 were compromised in some way, changing the actual content of the transaction is really hard. It would be pretty damn hard to find other valid input permutations that would yield structurally correct data.

Not entirely. Nonce is split between the header and the coinbase transaction. Also, only the header is hashed, not the individual transactions. The header contains the merkle root hash of all transactions in the block. If you cycle through the nonce in the header, the one in the coinbase is incremented, changing the merkle root hash in the header and then you start from 0 in the header nonce again. Repeat until block hash is valid.

Sorry, I meant to say empirical evidence, you're right.
And sorry again, I meant the Planck length, not the Planck constant. The study I was referring to (still can't find it dammit) tried to find out if we live in a grid universe. If this is the case, their study of the light polarity distribution from distant stars / quasars / pulsars (don't remember which ones they measured) would prove if this was the case. They couldn't find any meaningful anomalies and concluded that either the grid universe hypothesis is wrong, or the **Planck length** is smaller than previously thought, thus setting an upper bound to that value.

They are gone forever. But fear not, Bitcoin is infinitely divisible (currently down to 8 decimal places, but more can be added). The entire economy could run just fine if only 1 bitcoin was left.


Yup! But that's only fair, since they've taken the risk of investing into bitcoin when it's not even clear if it'll last.


You don't have to deal in bitcoin, cash is just fine. Bitcoin will never replace all the world's currencies.


It's true that bitcoin's value will fluctuate greatly in the beginning, but that will decrease over time. Also, the same argument could be made for buying a computer. You could buy it now, or wait six months and buy the same computer for 25% less. Eventually you're still going to buy that computer.


You don't need the full blockchain in order to use bitcoin. You could use a thin client that connects to a server that has the full blockchain, or you could only download the headers of the blocks (not sure if there are clients out there that support this already).


10 minutes on average for the first confirmation if you include a fee. There are ways to speed this up though. You could send through a green address, one that is guaranteed to be legit. MtGox offers this service. Merchants could instantly accept payments from that address. Another way is to only listen to trusted peers on the network, like miners. If they say your transaction is legit, then you could assume it's going to end up in the block chain eventually.


That's completely up to you. It's still early days, the price is still volatile, there's no way of knowing where it will go. Now you understand why the early investors stand to make big profits if everything works out. :)
And as always, never invest more than you are willing to lose.

Obviously security is always an issue, but it does not enter the equation when making an actual payment. The security for receiving a payment lies completely with the vendor.

Depending on the country, there are two things that could happen:
1 - The bitcoin network in that country would grind to a halt since no new blocks would be generated there (the difficulty is just too high). 
2 - They generate a fork chain that would confirm at a slower pace than normal. When the network merges again, the longer chain would win and transactions of the shorter chain would be merged back into the main chain. There is a huge potential for double spends during the split. 
Having said that, you'd need only one single node that operates on both networks (through dial-up perhaps) to eliminate the fork issue.

There are several ways to get instant payment verification without having to change the block generation time. As a merchant, you could recognize payments coming from [green addresses]( Addresses that are known to be legit. Like an address that comes from CoinBase or MtGox. 
Another way would be to only listen to trusted sources for transactions. So you're not picking up transactions from random nodes (like an attacker) but directly from mining pools. If the pools relay the transaction, it basically means  "yeah, this transaction looks legit, we're going to include it into a block".

No. The intermediate (starts with passphrase) code is only one part of the equation. bit-card would generate a new, random number and using that, it generates the encrypted private key. So you'd need to know that random number, but that number is never exposed out in the open. 
It's basically an implementation of the [Diffie-Hellman problem]( for generating an asymmetric shared secret. One party knows the public key (bit-card), the other party will know both the private and public key (you) with encryption layered on top.

The recipient claims funds by providing the public key that hashes to the address that the funds were sent to and he also provides a signature to prove that he has control of the private key associated with that public key / address.
No, there are no unaccounted for bitcoins. All bitcoins are waiting to be claimed by their owners (the people that hold the private keys). If you add up all the bitcoins sitting in unspent outputs, you get exactly the number of bitcoins that have been mined.

Another important thing, seeing as she's using blockchain.info, you could set up 2 wallet accounts. One where you keep your coins and in the second one only import a watch only address from the first wallet. 
That way she can receive coins in that second wallet, see that the transaction has been sent and she doesn't have to worry about clients forcing her to give up her coins.

1) Use a [BIP 32]( wallet to accept payments. This will allow you to generate unique public keys per transaction on your server, without exposing the private keys. You can thus keep all your private keys on a separate machine -&gt; no loss of funds should your front end be hacked.
2) Have your payment server connect to your front end through TOR, to identify which public keys were generated and used to receive payments. The upside of this is, if your fronted is compromised, they won't be able to tunnel through to your payment server, since it's hidden behind the TOR network. 
 
3) Keep your tables bitcoin only to eliminate float risk.
4) Implement a provably fair system so people can verify that you're not stacking the deck against them. Bitcoin gamblers are used to this by now since all the dice games offer this. It keeps everyone honest.
5) If you're using an app, consider switching to using [public key verification]( instead of using a hashed password database on the front end. The user experience is the same (password is instead used to decrypt a private key stored on the user's computer), but now there's not even a password database to steal from your front end.
6) If you implement 5, you could have the client app sign all pay out requests. Result is that should your front end be compromised, it's impossible to forge payout requests to the payment server.

The [bitcoin wiki]( addresses most of the scalability concerns.
1. No. The free market is. There's no way for the bitcoin network to 'regulate' the mining market.
2. No. Miners operate in pools, so if the pool members don't like what the operators are doing, they self-organize and leave the pool. On top of that, if they were to make any breaking changes to bitcoin, then their blocks would not be accepted by the people's bitcoin clients. Miners don't have any more influence than any other user on the network. Same goes for the core devs.
3. Could be, if they manage to find them. But that doesn't really matter much. We'd see a slight increase in block confirmation times for 2 weeks max and then everything is back to normal. There are enough distributed mining pools out there to secure the network.

I'm going to ignore dictionary attacks, as those are a completely different animal.
BIP38 uses Scrypt as its key stretching algorithm. It's a memory hard algorithm that is hard to optimize. Even the fastest implementations would only be able to do, say, 10M guesses per second. Now let's assume that your attacker has a botnet of 100,000 nodes that can all do 10M guesses per second, that's 1T guesses per second. 
Let's say your password contains lower/upper/numbers/special chars and is 10 characters long.
For the characters thats: 26 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 72 possibilities.
So the formula becomes: 72^10 / 1,000,000,000,000 ~= 3,743,906 seconds ~= 62,398 minutes ~= 1,039 hours ~=  43 days.
That's to search the entire space. You have to divide that by two to get the average time to find your password, so it takes about 22 days to crack a 10 character password with a really fast Scrypt implementation and a botnet with 100,000 nodes.
The length of the password is the most important factor here. The longer your password, the faster the number goes up (not the difficulty in terms of character types).
So think of a nice long phrase that doesn't come from a book and you should be fine.

Popular addresses are excluded because they cause a lot of noise. Most of those addresses are gambling sites and don't represent 'true' transactions. That's why the graph I linked to exists.

There are ways to increase the block size without it having a negative effect on propagation times. 
There has been talk of sending a reduced block (header + coinbase + list of transaction hashes) instead of sending the full block. Since most nodes have all transactions already, they can reconstitute the block locally, without having to fetch the entire thing.
This increases block propagation times significantly, allowing for larger blocks.

That's not an attack. That's just sending bitcoin to the same address. Bitcoins are referenced by transaction hash and output index. The content of the output script is irrelevant.
The only way you can 'overwrite' a transaction is by forcing a SHA-256 collision, creating a duplicate transaction hash + index pair. That was possible before because miners generate the first transaction themselves and could stuff anything into the coinbase input script, resulting in the same transaction hash (if they sent it to the same address). They'd 'overwrite' their previous transaction in the UTXO db. Nowadays that no longer happens because the coinbase input contains extra nonce and block height, forcing all coinbase transaction hashes to be unique.
@_date: 2013-11-11 04:20:29
The value of bitcoin definitely factors into it. Bitcoin doesn't work in a vacuum. Real world costs need to be factored in. As long as miners are making a profit, they'll continue to mine. 
There are 3 parts to this equation.
1. Bitcoin earned from mining a block.
2. Hardware cost + electricity cost.
3. Bitcoin price.
If the value of bitcoin were to drop to just a fraction of what it is today, you'll see the difficulty go down since miners will shut off their hardware because they aren't make a profit. We've seen that happen already in 2011 after the bubble pop then.

When people say this, just show them [this picture](


BitPay is reporting the opposite. People tend to spend their bitcoin more, when the price goes up. You don't just use bitcoin because you want to earn money, you also use it because its superior to using a credit card. You won't lose any money if you buy something with bitcoin and then use fiat to buy bitcoin again. 


You can write that as 10.35 uBTC. 


Bitcoin isn't about earning money, at least, that's not its original intent. It's about having a superior monetary system than what's currently available. The fact that it's appreciating in value rapidly is just extra (granted, it's a BIG extra).

1: I don't know who owns the bulk of the old coins, but I do know that they took on a lot of (financial) risk in getting them. To be frank, I think they'd be just as pissed at you if you made the same kind of bank as them with a fraction of the risk.
2: The more computational power you need to add a block to the blockchain, the more resistant the network is to a 51% attack. 
a: No, you'd never reach consensus, since everyone and his brother could be generating a fork off any recent block, effectively grinding the network to a halt.
b: No, the only property of the block hash is that it has to have X leading zeros. Bitcoin uses double sha256 as a hash, if you can compute it any faster than the current ASIC hardware in the market, you can make a lot of money.

You could wait for trusted nodes on the network (like big mining pools) to relay the transaction to you. Even if it's not confirmed, the miners are basically saying "Yeah, it's legit, we'll add it to a block soon".

Because it simply doesn't scale that far up. It'll never be able to process the number of transactions per second required. On top of that, it would require all governments to switch to bitcoin as their sole currency. That's simply not realistic.
But that's not a bad thing. Bitcoin doesn't have to be the only currency in the world to be wildly successful. 
But it would have to achieve any of the following things to any reasonable degree to be (IMHO) considered successful:
- Online payment method of choice.
- Store of value of choice.
- Form of remittance of choice.
 
If that happens, bitcoin will have a 1T+ market cap. It will have enough liquidity to remain stable and moving in and out of a bitcoin position will be easy (either through spending or exchange for fiat).

You have yet to demonstrate that there are known weaknesses in SHA256 that will make reversing (preimage) the algorithm possible. Simply generating a collision isn't enough. Your collision input has to be a valid ECDSA public key for which you have the private key.
If you want to preimage a public address, you not only have to break SHA256, but RIPEMD160 *and* secp256k1 ECDSA. 
As for trying to generate block hashes faster than is currently done by preimaging SHA256 on a larger space (any bigint that satisfies the current difficulty will do), you run into the same problem. The input must be a sane block header. And the same goes for trying to replace a transaction inside a block. 
It's a lot harder than you describe and I don't see it happening any time soon, most definitely not in 5 years.
@_date: 2013-10-22 00:54:44
Yes, the other miner could also solve a block building off the same previous block. It then comes down to what block is used to build off of. If miner A's block is used, miner B's block is ignored and vice versa. These forks can become longer than just 1 block though, but it all works out in the end.
The new coins generated in new blocks won't be spendable until at least 120 blocks have been built on top of it in a chain. 
As for double spending, as long as no reorganization (switching to a different chain of blocks) happens on chains longer than 6 blocks (which is the usual confirmation count used by most people), things will auto correct just fine.

Even if dividend ended up being 0.01 average over the year, the stock is still ridiculously undervalued. If you look at regular stock, a 10% APR is extremely high, so let's assume that value. 0.01 * 52 = 0.52 dividend a year. If that's 10% that would put the price of one share at 5.2 BTC.

The number of coins minted over time is constant. 50 every ~10 minutes for the first 4 years. Now we're at 25 ~10 minutes. This will halve again, and again, every 4 years, until we reach 0 in 2140.


Huh? I have no idea what you mean by this.




To put things into perspective, the current network has about over 10 times the computational power of the entire top 500 super computers in the world combined. The Bitcoin network is the biggest super computer on the planet, bar none. 
The network adjusts the hashing difficulty every 2016 blocks (about 2 weeks worth of blocks). So there's no need to 'redo' anything. You'd have to compute all blocks from whatever point you wish to fork, match all the cumulative computing power, to reach an equal total difficulty of the existing chain, then surpass it, and then have the rest of the network accept it. 
And that last part is tricky, because the current client has checkpoints built in. Hard coded block hashes of 'known good' blocks, to prevent exactly this sort of attack.

The thing with CoinJoin is that you need to have multiple parties collaborating to create a transaction, safely and anonymously. That requires out of  band communication. So it's not as simple as just generating a transaction and sending it onto the network. You need to create a system that allows those parties to communicate. Then there's also the issue of preventing a single party from figuring out which inputs and outputs are associated, since that's the whole point of CoinJoin to begin with. That's also a pretty tough thing to solve.

Transactions need to use all the coins coming from another transaction. So if you only want to send a fraction of that, you have to send the change to another address you control. Many clients will create a new address for this purpose, which is dangerous in the case of a paper wallet.

Confirmation speed inversely proportional to the amount. Small transactions like a cup of coffee require high confirmation speed, whereas buying a car or house won't be affected by a one hour or longer confirmation. As a result, the incentive to scam a merchant is low, considering the amount of money that can be made.
The techniques described above are for confirming small transactions. Larger ones should not depend on this.

I used to think the same thing, however, Litecoin seems to have found its purpose recently. 
The Bitcoin core devs are very risk averse, which obviously makes sense when you're responsible for the codebase that manages $2.5Bn. However, some of those proposals are very interesting and would only really prove themselves in a real world test, not something on a testnet. 
The Litecoin devs have (as far as I've heard) agreed to add some of those proposals to Litecoin in order to test it out, basically becoming a testbed for new features and should those features pan out, can then be proposed to be incorporated into Bitcoin, with the real world proof to back up why it's a good idea.

I don't think BitPay is trying to mislead us. They also have investors to report to and sending out two conflicting messages would be suicide to them.
Also, psychology comes into play here. People bought in for $X and are now able to afford items worth $Y. Those coins are starting to burn a hole in their pocket. Everyone has their price, be it consciously or unconsciously. I'm holding for the long term, but I'll definitely be spending some coins when I hit my strike price.
Then there's that whole illusion of hoarding. It's a fallacy. 99% of all wealth is 'hoarded'. You don't spend all your money as soon as you get it and neither do the businesses that you buy from. Money is at rest 99% of the time, if not more.
Even regular currency exchanges only have a tiny fraction of the monetary base flowing through them.

No, we're not. Even if they made such a change, the miners would have to accept them *and* the users. You can mine millions of extra coins for all I care, but chances are you won't be able to spend them because most, if not all bitcoin users won't run that version of the client. Those coins would be rejected. So they're worthless.

1. The value proposition of bitcoin is enormous. Full control over your assets, no counterfeiting, no transfer restrictions, global, programmable, no sensitive information exposed when making a transaction, etc. What's not to like?
2. Good. I invested only a small portion of my wealth into bitcoin and I managed to mine quite a few coins as well. I like the price jumps because it drives adoption. I dislike the price jumps because I don't want to buy into parabolic rises.
3. I plan on spending my bitcoin (see previous point). I'm not interested in making a profit in fiat.
4. Bitcoin.
5. Yes, but the infrastructure isn't ready for that yet. We need better hardware for that. When mobile devices offer secure enclaves for private key storage and transaction signing, that's when things get interesting.
6. No idea. Some have more bitcoin than brains though (sorry folks) and are far too gullible. Other truly are generous when it comes to donating to legit causes.
7. When I first heard about it (in late 2009, early 2010, I heard about it in the context of drugs and kiddie porn, which made me walk away from it). Later, in early 2011, I heard about the increase in popularity and that there were exchanges where you could buy them and decided to read up on it (how the hell do you make a decentralized payment network work?), when I understood the technical fundamentals, I was all over it.

Currently, the fee is applied twice. As a buyer, if I buy bitcoins on MtGox, I pay 0.53% (or something close to it). The seller also pays a fee, but it could be less if he trades more. Maybe he only pays 0.50%. 
This doesn't change if you do cross exchange trading. I could be using MtGox, and I would be paying 0.53%, and the person that I'm trading with could be using btc-e and he would be paying a different fee than me.

Bitcoin suffered a forking incident shortly after the 0.8 client was introduced. The problem was a bug in the 0.7.x client's database manager, that resulted in a certain block being seen as invalid, when it was actually valid. The fork was exceptionally long, but stayed under 120 blocks IIRC. There was one successful double spend, but it was an experiment and not malicious. The miners that generated the abandoned chain were compensated for their work and the issue was swiftly resolved.

This would only have to be done by a majority of the miners, not the clients, so no forking required. Basically they'd ignore any block that doesn't remove X transactions from the mempool.

You can order BIP 38 cards from them (2 factor cards). 
This is a solution to the problem you describe. You basically generate a passphrase code that's used to generate a public key and an encrypted private key.
At no point will they ever have access to your private key. 
If you want, you can read all about [BIP 38 here]( 
Here's an example:
The password in this case is: test
The passphrase code generated is: passphrasem7SxmsxJg2yhz1u9MHVGL9rNcEscUEBp1KMohLRqU6G1AXFJv5orxxttNoGhVg
They will then send you a confirmation code that looks like this:
And the generated address is: 1Mm35pMCZQJuPcDZRrdQSzbR21eX7TKwdF
The encrypted private key (which will be below the sticker) looks like this:
The decrypted private key is: 5Jr2NoFzYUcCagtBje2S8t6wtXYS8vZHhWueRChVBzmKh3QjhKc
The confirmation code + your password (in this case test) will produce the address, so when you receive the card, you can verify that the address matches the one from the confirmation code and that it was encrypted using your password.
You can test the above codes on:

If it scales back, it's because it's not economically feasible for some miners. It also means that Bitcoin's market cap has gone down. Like I said, it's self regulating.


Currently, you would need more than the entire top 500 of the worlds super computers in order to do a sustained 51% attack. In order to make back the investment in energy, you'd have to move a lot of money. 
Also, doing a double spend means you'd already have to own the BTC you're trying to double spend. So if you want to double spend millions of BTC, you'd have to own those millions. Again, highly unlikely.
Seriously, it's just never going to happen.

Miners will stop mining if their energy cost goes above their returns. This is different for a lot of people. For one, they could be getting cheap electricity, or they could be using old hardware like GPU's. So over time, the hash rate would drop, leaving only the miners that are making a profit.
It's a self optimizing system. We went from CPU's (very wasteful) to GPU's (an order of magnitude better) to FPGA's (another order of magnitude better) to ASICs (several orders of magnitude better). 
Over time, we'll lose the GPU's and FPGA's and the system will be ASIC only. That will be a significant optimization energy wise. 
After some time, Gen 2 of the ASICS will hit and the cycle will continue.

Even though the word deflationary is used to describe bitcoin, the root causes for deflation can be wildly different, which also results in different effects. The deflation that caused the great depression is different than when people move into bitcoin, growing its user base, which increases the price.
Prices in bitcoin remain fluid, because we still use current fiat as the measure. That's the key difference. Similarly, when people receive their salary in bitcoin, it will still be constant in the local currency and then converted to bitcoin at current spot value. 
Since bitcoin can be divided down to 8 decimal places, this simply means we divide down further if necessary. 
There is one good example where price is fixed in BTC and you can see the controversy surrounding it and that's the Trezor that's being sold at a fixed price of 1 BTC. People are pissed that it's basically a simple dongle that's now being sold for $1000 and people aren't having it, so sales stagnate.

There's a little chip called a [TPM]( chip that lays the groundwork for a system like this and my hope is that these will solve the security issue. The TPM chip that I linked to is obviously not suited since it doesn't support [secp256k1]( and [RFC 6979]( (which removes the need and threat of a built in random number generator) but eventually these kinds of chips will become available and can possibly be integrated into phones and computers.

They are tamper evident stickers. Even if you manage to open the wallet, sealing it up again wouldn't work because part of the sticker will remain on the paper, which will show up as bumps under any new sticker.
The point of paper wallets is cold storage. Paper wallets are terrible forms of exchange since you can never be certain that the creator hasn't kept a copy of the private key, regardless of any stickers / other physical attributes.

- regenerate main net and testnet genesis blocks
- remove checkpoints
- change the port numbers and address prefixes
- done
And if you want to add safety, you could take the namecoin merged mining code and move that in, so you have the hashing power of the bitcoin blockchain to back you up (you'd need cooperation from the bitcoin miners for that though).

Edit: There was a bug in (IIRC) Electrum's script interpreter a while back and people found a message embedded in a transaction that stated that 'he' fixed this same issue in the bitcoin-qt client a while back.

@_date: 2013-11-16 03:47:59
There was a thread on bitcointalk that a double SHA256 computation takes about 3,600 instructions on an ATI GPU. These are all integer operations by the way, super computers are usually measured in floating point operations per second. 
But going by that number, 3,600 integer operations * 4.7 Peta hashes per second, gives you 16.92 Exa integer operations per second. 
The [total computational power of the top 500 supercomputers]( is ~300 Peta FLOPS. 
Now you can't really compare integer operations and floating point operations, but if you ignore that for a second, then you'd get:
16,920 / 300 = 56.4
So a factor of 56.4 difference.
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:29:27
Ah, in that case it depends on when blockchain.info sees your transaction. Remember, it's an ever changing peer to peer network, so it's totally possible that one transaction that was broadcast later, would propagate along a different route before blockchain.info sees it, than the one before it. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:29:52
This goes deeper into how bitcoin actually works when you send a transaction. Basically, when you send someone X BTC, it'll find a number of input transactions (that were sent to you) and group those into a new transaction such that the total input value is larger than X. The remainder is sent to a new address that you control. By default, the Bitcoin-QT will pre-generate 100 keypairs that are used as change addresses for exactly this purpose. When it's out of empty addresses, it'll generate new ones. If you don't back up your wallet.dat from time to time, and you lose your wallet (harddrive crash), then you could potentially lose those change addresses and the bitcoin that was sent to them.

The genesis block is just an ordinary block with two changes. 
- The previous block hash is set to all zeroes.
- In the case of Bitcoin, the coin base transaction contains a headline from a newspaper to prove that the block was not mined before a specific date.
@_date: 2013-04-02 23:24:15
The number of bitcoins is limited to 21 million. When bitcoin started, they were generated at a rate of 50 bitcoins per block, 2016 blocks per 2 weeks. After 4 years, this number was halved to 25 new bitcoins per block. It wil keep halving until it reaches zero, at which point, 21 million will be in circulation and no more. The new coins are rewarded to the miner (currently only miner groups called mining pools exist) that generates a new block succesfully. On average a new block is generated every 10 minutes. 
So miners receive the new coins, because they do the heavy lifting for everyone that uses bitcoin. They validate that transactions are valid and are added to the block chain in a timely fashion. 
In order to get bitcoins, you could join a mining pool, but you'd need some serious hardware to turn a profit, or you could buy them on an exchange, or from people you know that have them that are willing to sell them to you.

RAID is meant to increase reliability of data storage with low cost hardware. There is no need for it in a system designed to be massively redundant.

It's also inaccurate (or at the very least incomplete).


This is a very simplistic view of what actually happens. 
It's a little bit more complex (and a lot more awesome) than that:
Every transaction has a list of inputs and a list of outputs. You have to redeem a number of outputs from previous transactions to 'unlock' coins that you can then send on to new addresses.
Those previous outputs don't necessarily have to be sent to the same address. They could have been sent to many different addresses, just as long as Alice has control of the private keys associated with those addresses.
Once all the previous outputs have been redeemed (by producing signatures that are embedded in the inputs of the current transaction), she can now send them on to as many outputs as she wants. Outputs can only be redeemed once. Once a transaction redeems an output, it is considered 'spent'. Therefore, the entire value of an output must be spent.
The total bitcoin value of those previous outputs is added together and are then divided up among the new outputs that Alice wants to send the coins to. This is usually one or more outputs that she intends to send coins to and an extra one that will receive the change coins that she wants to keep. Everything she doesn't send on to those outputs is considered a fee for the miners.
The above is a little bit more how it works, but it's still not the whole story. Those inputs and outputs actually contain scripts. Currently there's only a small number of scripts that the network will accept (the most popular one being the "send to address X" script) and a newer one called Pay To Script Hash (P2SH). But ultimately, a lot of different scripts can be written that will allow many different transaction types. And then there are also other fields in the transaction, such as lock_time and inputs have a sequence field, which can be used for time delay and transaction replacement among other things.

If I claim funds from a transaction output sent to one of my addresses, I construct a transaction input that provides:
&amp;lt;signature&gt; &amp;lt;pubkey&gt; 
in the input script. The script of the transaction output that I am trying to claim contains:
OP_DUP OP_HASH &amp;lt;address&gt; OP_EQUAL OP_VERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
This script checks that a copy (OP_DUP) of the public key I provided hashes (OP_HASH) to the same &amp;lt;address&gt; (OP_EQUAL OP_VERIFY) and then uses the &amp;lt;pubkey&gt; and &amp;lt;signature&gt; to verify that I have ownership of the private key (OP_CHECKSIG).

It's written in C with the only exception being the ECC code (uses Sipa's secp256k1 C implementation for speed). This can be swapped out for Bouncy castle if you'd want a 100% pure C# implementation.
It needs a lot of work still, can't send transactions yet and the node is currently SPV only (and pretty naive, it'll currently accept pretty much anything you send it).
Not planning on releasing code until I've got send working and added some more checks to make the node less dumb. 
It also has an unfinished full node implementation, so it can switch between SPV and full node.
All three coins share the same code base with the 'essence' of each encapsulated in a single class, but the coin itself is exposed in its own namespace for ease of use. You need to instantiate just 2 classes, for example:
Bitcoin.Context for the node, arguments will tell it to behave as a full node or SPV node and Bitcoin.Wallet for the wallet. Same goes for Litecoin and Namecoin.
Anyway, if you have any questions, shoot!
Edit: forgot to mention. It supports [BIP 0032]( and [BIP 0038]( for wallets and [my own proposal]( for BIP 0032 master key encryption. It also supports regular WIF and Casascius' mini private keys (both 22 and 30 character lengths).

A block is basically a number of verified transactions bundled together, with a timestamp and some other network related stuff (difficulty, random number, etc). These blocks are basically the bitcoin public ledger. 


Addresses are a hashed form of the public key of a public/private key pair. When you 'receive' a transaction, what basically happens is a little script is written that says: "Anyone that can provide a public key that hashes to this address and a signature that was produced by the private key associated with that public key, has the right to spend these bitcoins in a new transaction."
Your wallet basically stores your private key, and references all the transaction outputs that make payments to your address. when you build a new transaction, it'll group together a number of transaction outputs to form a new transaction and provides the public keys + signatures to satisfy those little scripts. 


In the blockchain, although more importantly, the unspent transaction outputs (UTXO) database. This is the list of all transaction outputs that haven't been redeemed in new transactions yet and this list is referenced when new transactions come in that need to be validated.

No, you can only send coins from addresses that you control. the person that sent 0.52 btc sent it from 20+ of his own addresses to 2 addresses (have to spend all of the coins in 1 transaction) 1 address that he intends to send something to, the 0.52 btc and one address he himself controls (the 0.0025082 btc).

Mining is several orders of magnitude more efficient that traditional methods of money transmission, be it money trucks, credit cards or even regular wire transfers that still involve people and entire companies. The mining community is constantly optimizing itself to lower the cost and energy requirements of mining and increasing the yield. This will continue. We've only just now seen the first generation of ASICs and the next generation will eclipse the first one. 
It is absolutely not burdening the bitcoin economy, it's one of the fundamental building blocks that is required to keep the network secure. If adding transactions to the blockchain was easy, there'd be a lot of double spend attacks. The computational difficulty eliminates that entirely.

I have the same concern. My girlfriend has been bugging me to help her set up an account so she can buy some bitcoin. She only wants to invest $5000, but I would hate to see her lose that money and what the effect may be on our relationship. I've told her repeatedly that the price can plummet any moment, but she's made up her mind. We opened an account for her this morning and transferred the funds. Will be buying in in stages over the coming days.

Bitcoin is a very high risk investment. It could skyrocket or go to 0. 0.5 BTC would cost you about $550 right now. If you're fine in losing that money, then go ahead. Just make sure you understand the risks (both financial and security) before putting money into it.

I think you're right. Agencies can track all the coins they want, collaborate with any exchanges they want, as long as these lists stay private, there's no problem. 
In fact, I don't know if this has been brought up already, but public redlists offer a new attack vector on unsuspecting users.
If you get a message in your bitcoin wallet that some of your coins are redlisted, there will inevitably be scams popping up that will offer to 'clean' them for you. Either they do it for a ludicrous fee, or they just disappear with all your coins. 
On top of that, redlisted coin dust rains will inevitably happen to either make the redlist unusable, or by the afore mentioned scammers to try and lure people to surrender their coins.

When bitcoin reaches critical mass, the deflationary aspect of it isn't going to be as steep as it is now. It'll basically be like a built in interest rate. 
An example is buying a computer. You know that you'll be able to buy one that's cheaper and faster a couple months down the road, but yet there you are sitting behind your computer and using it. You still bought it.

No. The coinbase now requires the block height and on top of that, the output value is set in the transaction, so the transaction hash will always be different. If you manage to generate a collision with an earlier unspent coinbase transaction then you will have broken SHA-256.

1. Double spend transactions will be dropped.
2. It's easy to send a double spend transaction, but you would need to do a lot of work to successfully pull off a complete double spend scam. You'd need to do parallel mining in order generate a longer chain with the double spend transaction and then publish that branch.
3. You only ever need the private key. The public key and address are generated off that.
4. You'd have to receive all payments from third parties on separate addresses and only use them once. That makes it harder to group them.
5. Any kind of manipulation by the core dev team will either mean people won't upgrade to that version of the client, or an immediate drop in price. In other words, nobody wins.

It is very profitable if you make the right investments (and have the right connections). You need to design and manufacture those processors and get them online as soon as possible (the difficulty of mining a block is skyrocketing at the moment). 
Someone in China did this a little over half a year ago. He sold virtual shares in his company (called ASICMiner) and used those funds to do what I described above. He pays out weekly dividends to the shareholders so they share in the profits. His company is currently valued over $100M!
On top of mining, ASICMiner also sells its own hardware while its still profitable for the buyers and replaces it with more efficient next generation hardware. Part of those profits also goes to the share holders.
So it's pretty much a fulltime job these days.

Almost. The address starts with a 1, it's not the public key. The private key starts with a 5 if the public key is uncompressed (it uses both the X and Y coordinate when spending a transaction). If the public key is compressed (only the X coordinate and an indicator to know if Y was even or odd), the private key starts with either an L or a K. Compressed public keys are becoming more prevalent, which is a good thing since it goes from 65 bytes down to 33 when spending a transaction output.

@_date: 2013-12-02 23:08:44


Exactly. What you're doing is proving that you are the owner of that private key. You are signing the current transaction with the private key that produces a public key (that's also included) that hashes to a specific address (that's in the transaction you're trying to redeem). 
So you provide &lt;sig&gt; &lt;pubKey&gt; in the scriptSig, so that you can satisfy the script in the INPUT transaction (the one you're trying to redeem)
The input transaction does:
OP_DUP OP_HASH160 &lt;pubKeyHash&gt; OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
OP_DUP duplicates the top item on the stack, which is &lt;pubKey&gt;
OP_HASH160 then hashes that pubKey
&lt;pubKeyHash&gt; is then pushed on the stack
OP_EQUALVERIFY then checks if they top 2 items on the stack equal and if not, pushes false on the stack and returns.
OP_CHECKSIG then checks if &lt;sig&gt; and &lt;pubKey&gt; (the two remaining items on the stack) actually signed the current transaction.

No. The minting of bitcoins is done by the network.They can't be created outside the network and suddenly declared. The network would reject them instantly. 
Creation of new bitcoins are done by the miners. The miners perform a vital function for the bitcoin network. They verify all transactions and eternalize them in the public ledger, called the block chain. Adding new blocks to the block chain is extremely computationally expensive. This is done on purpose. It prevents people from adding fraudulent transactions to the block chain. The computational power needed to keep those fraudulent transactions in the block chain is enormous. Currently, the bitcoin network has more computational power than the entire top 500 of the worlds super computers combined. You'd have to have more computation power than the entire network in order to keep your fraudulent transactions in the block chain.

You're getting so little in return that if you try to spend those coins, you're going to lose most of it to transaction fees.

Basically you split your wallet into two parts. Your computer will still track your addresses and download the blockchain, but your private keys live in that small dongle. So your computer can build up a transaction, but now it first needs to be sent over USB to the dongle to be singed before it's ready to send.
The benefit is that your private keys are never on your computer, so malware can never steal your funds. The trezor displays the address that you are sending the funds to so if the transaction was modified by malware you would see it.
It eliminates practically all software related risks.
Edit: there is no standard for this as the trezor is the first one to do this afaik.

Bitcoin is hard to grasp because it's never been done before. It uses complex technologies and combines them in novel ways. On top of that, a large portion of bitcoin isn't in the code, it's in the way it's used. The Game Theory part of it. That's actually the part that most people today are still struggling with, even the experts.

I understand that you'd want to monetize a bitcoin node somehow, but it's hard to force people to use something like that, especially since it doesn't really help too much. Propagation is pretty fast as it is and on top of that, trusting a single node to forward your transaction for you means you're basically introducing a 3^rd party.

You don't have to start the blockchain from scratch. Bitcoin can simply move to a new hashing method and set a checkpoint at the first new block using the new method. 
SHA256 won't fall overnight, these things take a long time. We'll see it coming years before it becomes a real problem and by that time, we'll have moved to SHA3 or whatever new hashing method is chosen to succeed SHA256. 
The same goes for ECDSA.

No. The owners of those mining pools might agree to run the 'taxation' version of the software, but that wouldn't stop their members from moving to other mining pools. If you look at the current mining pools, it may look like there are only a few big players, giving you the impression that they can determine what happens and what not, but that completely depends on what their 'followers' (the ones doing the actual heavy lifting) think of it.

I'm assuming that with Shared Send, you mean Blockchain.info's shared send option and Shared Coin, you probably mean CoinJoin.
Shared Send is basically a shared wallet where bitcoins are sent and then mixed together, before moving on to where you want them to go. It's a way of anonymizing your transactions. The down side here is that you trust a 3rd party to not steal your bitcoins when he's mixing your coins with those from other people.
CoinJoin is a different way of 'mixing'. It's not really mixing, but it's basically joining the transactions of multiple parties into a single one, usually with the same output value. So you join your transaction of 10 bitcoin with a couple other parties and the output will be 10x 1 bitcoin to different addresses. The result is that at no point did you entrust someone else with your coins (you're simply joining multiple transactions into one) and because all outputs of the transaction in this case are 1 bitcoin, it's harder to figure out which ones were yours or someone else's.
The first one is a better type of mixing, but you have 3rd party risk, and the second one is a little bit easier to figure out, but no chance of losing your coins.

You're right. Any nefarious actor not interested in financial gain will be able to destabilize the bitcoin network. Having said that, the cost of such an attack is significant. Currently it would cost you over 400M in hardware to pull off a 51% attack on the network. 
Even then, there are ways this can be fixed. The Bitcoin-QT client has a checkpoint system in place that basically locks certain blocks in place that make it impossible to revert the block chain back to before that point. When an attack of such magnitude occurs, people could choose to set a checkpoint one block after the nefarious fork, invalidating all their effort in an instant. This is a really risky move though. 
Personally I don't see such an attack happening, simply because  supporting the bitcoin network will yield significant rewards if you have the resources to do so.

No. Litecoin uses a very specific set of parameters for Scrypt. Specifically, it uses N = 1024, p = 1, r = 1. Any ASIC will most likely have these parameters hardcoded (since they directly affect the amount of memory needed to compute the hash). Those specific parameters are actually very light and were never considered safe for password hashing in the first place.

What do you mean by staggered?
Do you mean the darker lines in the back? That's a 10 minute history of the market depth.
The fact that the red line is below the other ones tells you that coins have been bought, moving the price up and the ask depth 'down'. The darker lines below the green line tells you that the bid depth is moving up, and the price is going up.
The thing to note here however is that the bid depth is very shallow. It doesn't take much to move the price down again. There's almost no depth down to 420 in that picture. It looks like you could push the price down by selling ~50 coins.

Exchanges in Europe have it so much better than in the US and even Canada.
Take [bitonic]( for example. No login, no personal info of any kind needed to buy / sell BTC. 
They use iDeal for purchase. iDeal is irreversible (and allows for transfers of up to 10.000 EUR a day), so the chance of fraud for them is practically nil. As for the user, pretty much all banks give their clients either a [one time pad]( like solution with or a [small calculator like device]( that works by doing a challenge / response, which makes any kind of malware interception attacks very difficult. Once you've completed the iDeal transfer, the BTC is in your wallet in a matter of minutes.
As for selling BTC, they use SEPA transfers (0 fees), which means they can potentially wire it to any SEPA enabled bank in Europe, and the money will be in your account in a couple of days.
Granted, bitonic is nothing like a trading site (with order books and what not), but getting BTC is super easy.

The biggest issue with raising the block size limit is propagation times. 
From what I gathered from some discussions on the dev list (or bitcointalk, don't remember), this could be addressed by introducing another way of transmitting a block. Most clients already have all transactions that are currently pending, so you'd only have to send the header, coin base transaction and a list of transaction hashes that are in your newly generated block.
A node could reconstitute the block by pulling those transactions from the mempool and if it's missing any transactions could request the missing ones from the node that sent it the reduced block. If that fails, the full block can still be fetched.
This saves a substantial amount of data that has to be transmitted and will reduce the propagation time of new blocks significantly, allowing for larger blocks.

Posted in 2011. The fact that the US government is looking to regulate all the fringes of Bitcoin is pretty much a ringing endorsement. FinCEN wanting to regulate exchanges and the CFTC wanting to regulate Bitcoin *derivatives* (and other investments built on top of Bitcoin) pretty much means they want to bring Bitcoin into the fold of financial instruments. 
Regulation of these markets is a good thing! If we want Bitcoin to be a real viable alternative to credit cards and the like, then having legitimate, licensed businesses handle the conversion and investment side of things are an absolute must. We've seen it time and time again that exchanges and other investment sites pop up, take peoples' money and go dark again. If those institutions are regulated and licensed, then stuff like that won't happen again. 
I say bring it on! Regulate the crap out of those companies so I can be sure I won't get scammed out of my money.

- Store your 'savings' coins on your local machine, make sure that the wallet has a password and make backups of the wallet.dat every time you send coins from it. 
- For a checking account, you could use something like blockchain.info. It has apps for both android and ios. Be sure to only use the links to those apps on their website (prevent downloading spoof apps that steal your coins).
- Give your wallet an identifier label that you can remember (if you lose it, you'll lose your wallet).
- Use 2 passwords to encrypt your blockchain wallet.
- Use 2 factor auth to protect your wallet.
- link your email address to receive wallet backups.
- you can use the multibit client to restore that wallet backup locally if blockchain were to go belly up.
That should keep you busy for a while. ;)

The only way to not pay transaction fees is if you include your own transactions in a block yourself.

The biggest pool is currently 29%. If that one were to fall away, the block time would increase proportionately, so instead of 10 minutes it would become 13 minutes. And that would correct in less than 2 weeks. Not really a big deal. 
And that's not even the whole story. These are pools. people working together to mine bitcoin. If the operator falls away, the miners will switch to another pool almost instantly.

The ask and bid order books are separate. You're basically filling bids when you sell your bitcoins, which means the price will go down until your sell has been filled. That's also why you can see the price jumping up and down violently if asks and bids are filled in rapid succession. There could be several dollars difference between asks and bids.
Sorry, forgot to add, that's only the case if you sell your bitcoins at market price. It will start eating into the bids. If you place a limit order for X dollars, then you're adding your bitcoin ask to the ask order book.

You still pay for that insurance, either through a fee to own a credit card or through merchant fees that will affect the price for me, the consumer.

Hey, author here,
I understand your concern. The problem is that it's pretty hard to encode a tree structure efficiently, especially since that structure is ever changing as you receive more payments (on new addresses).
Secondly, the wallet software basically dictates how it generates and uses the keys internally, so standardizing on things like this could have unintended consequences for future development.
It sucks, I know. The only thing I can think of right now is fanning out X keys down N levels and constructing a bloom filter to optimize the blockchain rescan and then doing partial matching of addresses before doing a full check against a generated key. 
So basically, it's 3 tests to get a positive match. First it has to pass through the bloom filter, second, a partial address match of, say, the last 4 bytes of the address, which will yield you a number of tree paths to potential keys, which are then generated to do a full address match. 
You can test a significant number of keys when scanning like this and will most likely recover all transactions.
Obviously there are exceptions. If the wallet software generates random index branches, then you're pretty much screwed. Then again, if the wallet software supports this standard, odds are they'll have an import function and they'll run into that issue themselves.
Edit: For your information, when importing a BIP 0038 key, it has to do a full rescan of the blockchain. The iteration is slightly less expensive than the one I described above (since it's only doing one test and not potentially 3). But this proposal has one key feature, the genesis date, that makes it more efficient than BIP 0038. It only has to scan from the date specified and not from block 0 as is the case with BIP 0038.
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:07:42

Because there's a limit of 21 million total. These will be 'minted' by the peer to peer net work over time, with the last ones being produced in 2140. 
You don't have to buy a 'single' whole bitcoin. Bitcoin is divisible down to 8 decimal places.
It's basically like digital gold. Gold is also mined and there's also a limit to how much they can extract from the ground.

It doesn't work like that. you can't buy 5k at 84.8 without someone willing to sell them to you at that price. That's where the depth comes in, only if there's volume for that kind of sale, would you be able to buy 5k at 84.8. but since it dropped so fast, the bids haven't caught up to that price point and there's a big gap between the asks and the bids. say, the asks were pushed down to 84.8, but the bids didn't catch up and were left hovering at 90. if you wanted to buy, you'd be buying at 90 and only for the amount that's offered for 90.

To answer your question about a company building a massive mining platform, consider the following: The total hashing power of the bitcoin network is higher than the computing power of the top 10 super computers. Combined. You'd have to spend an insane amount of money in order to get a 51% advantage. Effectively you'd have to match the current hashing power *and then some* in order to force a fork of the block chain.

Free websites are never free. You're a mechanical turk if you go to those sites. You're probably solving captcha's that are used to spam reddit and other sites. Also, those small amounts are problematic for you. When you try to spend them, you are forced to pay a transaction fee because your transaction is made up of such small fractions of bitcoin that the size is larger than 1kb. So most of that is going straight to the miners.

No, only the header and any transactions inside the block that is applicable to them + merkle branch to prove the transaction is actually in the block. It's quite efficient.
SPV nodes send other nodes a bloom filter that is used to filter transactions so they receive all transactions that are of relevance to them + some extra to safeguard privacy. Using this filter, only fragments of a block is sent and most of the time it's limited to only the header (80 bytes), if the block doesn't contain any relevant transactions.

Transaction fees go to the miners. Currently that's only a fraction of their income, but the block reward halves every 4 years or so, so over time, that transaction fee part is going to grow more and more, proportionally.

If your root key is compromised, then yes, they'll have access to all your keys.
But the advantage of using a deterministic wallet is that you only have to back-up that single key, unlike wallets that generate new random addresses every once in a while (requiring a new back-up).
It's a trade-off.

User base growth and price increase don't have a linear relationship. If only 10% of all available bitcoins are offered on the exchanges and the user base starts to expand by 1%, then the price increase is going to have that factor built in. On top of that, during that expansion, the existing user base will most likely increase their position, amplifying the effect.

Paper wallets are terrible for trade, agreed. But for cold storage in a safe place they are excellent. The tamper evident sitckers are nothing more than a last line of defence, nothing more. 
USB drives or other digital forms of storage are dependent on technology. It could break, passwords could be forgotten, technology could progress, making access to the medium hard, etc. A paper wallet will always work, regardless. It only requires you print it out on acid proof paper, preferably with a laser printer. It will stay good for decades with little to no care.

First of all, make sure you have Two Factor Authentication enabled on your coinbase account and save the authenticator QR code someplace safe (print out the page on paper and keep it safe). You can use Google Authenticator or Authy for 2FA.
Secondly, make sure that in your coinbase account API access is DISABLED, so there's no alternate way of accessing your account.
Thirdly, head over to  and check the wallets that are available there. I'd go with something like Multibit or Electrum and make the proper backups once you've set it up and understand what it is.

I'm not sure what your point is. Like I said, producing a valid standard transaction that has a colliding hash is extremely unlikely, even if SHA256 is compromised, you're still restricted by the rules of the system. That means that your transaction has to be standard, or the block you modified will simply be rejected by the rest of the network.

Only when moving coins out would you need to send an actual bitcoin transaction out into the world. Whatever happens in-game is contained and won't affect the bitcoin economy at all.

The first transaction in a new block is a payment of 25 new bitcoins + transaction fees to yourself (or in the case of pooled mining to the pool operator who later distributes it to the contributors).

Adding more decimal places would require rewriting all the wallet implementations out there. It's not easy peasy, so it won't be done on a whim. The value of bitcoin will have to go up so incredibly high before that's necessary though.

1.00000000 BTC

1,000,000.00 uBTC

Litecoin's block time is 2.5 minutes and is chugging along just fine. So even if we hit the cap of 4x difficulty increase, we're probably good for another 4x increase in that same 2016 block frame. 
The amount of hardware that would have to be brought online to move to consistent sub-minute block generation would be absolutely staggering and would most probably not be sustainable for any serious amount of time. 
One remedy could be some of the big miners ramping down their hashing power voluntarily, or if all that new hashing power comes from unknown sources, to temporarily start ignoring their generated blocks. That last option would be very bad though.

It is not the "default *maximum* block size" it's the default block size. Meaning that miners will generate blocks of about this size, if they don't tweak this value themselves. Some generate bigger ones, some generate smaller ones and a fair number of them don't even configure the settings.
So yes, older clients will accept blocks that are smaller than 1.000.000 bytes. The default block size has no effect on them. It's a miner setting.

Under the hood, it simply takes X transactions that you received and uses those as inputs to the transaction that you're sending. Any leftovers are sent to a newly generated change address.
Your second transaction will do the same, if you've got enough unspent input transactions with over 6 confirmations. If that's not the case, the client will probably show you an error / warning.
If you want to send to 2 parties, you could send coins to multiple addresses in the same transaction. In the send tab, there should be an add recipient button (or something to that extent).

No. You are connecting to the pool operator that hands you a range of nonces (the random part in a transaction) to test. You report back if one of the hashes meets the current difficulty criteria. The pool will then distribute the found block to the rest of the network. So the pool is seen as a single node on the network.

I do have one issue though. They're currently using Bitstamp as their exchange and apparently Bitstamp has the nasty habit of spending unconfirmed transactions in new transactions. The result is that the entire chain of transactions is backed up.

Q1: no, you need message (transaction), sig and pubkey to validate that a message (transaction) was signed using a specific private key.
Q2: The separator is not used in standard transactions right now. Basically, the scriptSig is executed first, then with the stack content, it executes scriptPubKey. the scripts aren't joined anymore as stated on that wiki page (or that image anyway) since there was an exploit possible if that remained.
Q3: Since the signature will be embedded in the transaction, it can't sign itself, so you have to sign a version of the transaction that doesn't include it. Basically all inputs are cleared except for the one where you're ~~sending to~~ receiving from. Along with that, the hash type is appended. The resulting data is then hashed and a signature is computed using the private key. 
edit: to elaborate on Q3 a bit, you're basically 'pasting' the scriptPubKey into the input script. since the two scripts aren't joined and there's no separator opcode, the entire scriptPubKey basically ends up in that input.
edit 2: I suggest reading the [OP_CHECKSIG]( page for further details.

Yes I meant Buying. The only things I see popping this so called bubble is if MtGox is hacked again and loses a lot of its coins or if the US government cracks down on exchanges. 
Other than that, I don't see any real threats to Bitcoin. Adoption is accelerating, some big players are starting to look into it and the only thing holding people back from getting their hands on coins is the small funnel they have to pass through in order to get them.
There are currently no indicators that this is going to all of a sudden stop. Even the volatility of the market isn't putting much of a dent in the price rise. It drops (granted, 20% - 25% is a big drop), and rebounds in less than 4 hours.

No, it's self regulating. If mining is no longer profitable, it will scale back, yes, however, profits for an attacker will scale down equally. 
On top of that, everyone keeps going on about a 51% attack when effectively, you can only do a double spend. And your window of opportunity is incredibly small and highly uncertain. You need to generate 6 consecutive blocks in order to pull off a double spend that's actually worth doing and timing is critical. 
The damage done by a double spend is minimal and there's no reason that someone doing a large transaction doesn't wait longer than 6 confirmations to assume that a payment is legit. 
If you assume that the velocity of a transaction is inversely proportional to the amount, then the chance of a double spend is practically zero.

Edit: I highly doubt that they'd agree to something like that. The main incentive for miners to do what they do is the block reward. This reward halves over time and will end up being 0 in 2140. After that, they live off the transaction fees. If there were any kind of taxation that would take a significant chunk out of those fees, they would stop doing what they're doing and the whole network would collapse.
Edit 2: On top of that, it's a global currency, how would you know which government would receive which part of that taxation?

You're assuming a drastic sudden reduction in hashing power. That's be interesting to see. I highly doubt it would ever happen though.
The 54uBTC limit is configurable. Also, Bitcoin is currently not ready for millions of transactions per second. Remember, it's still in beta, it's still being developed and when time goes on, it will be able to handle larger volumes of transactions and the 54uBTC limit will go down.

Quantum computers aren't some sort of magical machines that can do anything in the blink of an eye. Their application is extremely limited to a specific subset of algorithms. 
I'm not too well versed on the hashing algorithm used by bitcoin or the other crypto algo's, but chances are that quantum computing is not going to be able to speed it up in any significant way.
Even if they were able to speed up mining or even break the wallet keys, the run up to that device being deployed would give the devs ample time to take precautionary measures. It's not going to pop up out of nowhere. These type of machines are extremely hard to manufacture and require a lot of upkeep to keep going.

- Miners would have to start using the changed client in order to get blocks generated with those new rules.
- Then there's the users that will have to accept those blocks.
As it stands, you need quite a few people to agree with you in order to make big changes.
Edit: Just to elaborate, the core devs are pretty risk averse. Nothing will end up in the codebase before it is thoroughly understood what the ramifications are. Anything that has the potential to screw up the network will not be added lightly before it has been well tested. There's currently a [wish list]( of changes that could be added, but doing so would break compatibility with all the clients currently out there, which is why it's not in the bitcoin-qt client yet.

One of bitcoin's fundamentals is its decentralization. As soon as you take that away, like backing it with something else, bitcoin's entire architecture no longer makes sense.

The energy itself is not 'intrinsic' to bitcoin since the first bitcoins were generated at difficulty 1, with regular desktop computers, but they are worth just as much as the ones generated today.

The only precedent that comes close to this was the recent block chain fork due to the bug in clients older than v0.8. The devs and mining pools agreed to discard the 0.8 generated block chain and switch to the 0.7 and older block chain in order to stay compatible with all the clients out there. They released a patch recently that makes v0.8 behave the same way as v0.7 until may 15^th when it will resume working the way it was supposed to.

The best investment strategy is dollar cost averaging. Buy a bit now, buy some more next week or next month, etc. Usually that means you're going to get a couple good deals to average out the 'bad' ones. But honestly, if you buy in as an investment, stash the coins somewhere where you can't access them easily. If there is a crash, then you're not going to panic sell, compounding the crash. See it as a buying opportunity instead. Oh, and don't buy if it goes parabolic. ;)

I'm still debating whether or not to show the addresses in the overview. It's best not to reuse addresses and listing them as such only encourages the wrong behavior. But not showing them is probably a bit disconcerting to most Bitcoiners.

No. Every node validates incoming transactions before they are passed on. 
If you want to double spend, you basically have to send out 2 transactions that try to spend the same input coins and then 'race the network'. Meaning, you hope that your scam transaction reaches the merchant and that the refund one reaches the miners first. That alone is a big gamble (it takes mere seconds for a transaction to propagate through the entire network).
There are several things you can do to determine if a transaction is legit.
1. Connect to lots of nodes. The faster you receive your transaction the better.
2. Don't allow incoming connections. This prevents a potential scammer from sending you the scam transaction directly.
You can now do 2 things:
1. You can be proactive, try to forward your transactions to as many connected nodes as quick as possible. This gives the potential scammer a smaller chance of succeeding.
2. You can be passive and check how many nodes actually offer your transaction to you to see if it properly propagated.
You can do the above 50/50. Half the nodes are monitored for additional offerings, the other half you send the transaction as fast as possible.
0.9 (or maybe later) will contain reject messages. What you can do with these is check whether or not the transaction you just received is an attempted double spend (according to the nod you are trying to send it to). So it allows you to probe the rest of the network, trying to flush out if there's a double spend happening.
The above takes mere seconds to execute.

Satoshi had a brilliant idea, executed the deployment masterfully (by not exposing himself and sitting on X coins without spending them), but the code he wrote was not super. He was definitely not a top caliber programmer.

Currently, no. I'm fairly confident that the UI doesn't run on those platforms because it is heavily modified WinForms code. 
The back-end (the coin libraries) currently depend on a C library for the EC code and it would require a little bit of effort to get the p/invokes to work on those other platforms. But other than that, I don't expect any big issues. 
But first things first. I want to get the main functionality up and running and stable before I worry about cross-platform support.

You'd be surprised by the [adoption of cellphones in africa]( There's now a [bitcoin text message service]( so no need for a smartphone or internet. It's currently US only, but that's simply because they've just started.
Bitcoin requires internet access, or as described above, a dumbphone that can send and receive text messages. If that infrastructure is in danger of collapse, then we probably have bigger issues to worry about than bitcoin.
One thing you have to remember is, bitcoin started in 2009. It's 2013 now, just a measly 4 years later. Seriously, this stuff takes time to develop. The open source community, now (thankfully) with help from some venture capitalists is what's driving the development of bitcoin. No government, no big banks, nothing. Seriously, that's *impressive*, wouldn't you say?

I personally have the feeling that Litecoin was started by people that feel they got into the Bitcoin game too late and want to start their own little revolution to one day have lots of money. The problem here is that Litecoin just doesn't add any significant advantages over Bitcoin to persuade a big enough group of people to actually start using them.
The two main differences (number of coins and transaction confirmation) are completely useless. Bitcoin can be divided infinitely, so for all intents and purposes, that 21M could just as well have been 1 btc but with proportionally smaller block rewards. It wouldn't have made a lick of difference.
The same goes for transaction confirmations. There are several ways you can speed up the transaction verification process that doesn't require a transaction to be incorporated into the blockchain. Green addresses is one of them. Another is to wait for a trusted source to confirm the transaction as being valid.
So there go 2 main selling points of Litecoin. Poof, gone.
@_date: 2013-04-27 09:13:16
The time limitation is due to the "Proof of Work". The hashing of blocks has to be computationally expensive in order to keep the network secure. This is part of bitcoin's Game Theory, where participating in mining is more rewarding than attacking the network.
In bitcoin, the hashing difficulty is set that it should take roughly 10 minutes to find a block hash. In Litecoin for example, this is set to 2.5 minutes.
It's really moot, since there are other ways to be reasonably confident that a transaction is legit (for smaller transactions obviously). 
There's the green address approach, where a service (like MtGox or blockchain) where you keep your coins always makes payments from a specific address that merchants can trust. Transaction can be assumed valid instantly.
Another way is to only trust a specific set of peers on the bitcoin network, like miners to report to you that they think a transaction is legit (instead of listening to random nodes).

Not sure what you mean by this, but the square bubble you're looking at is not a single transaction by a single person. It is in fact a collection of transactions from multiple people that has just been added to the blockchain.

A transaction contains all the source transactions that funded a specific address. If you receive a lot of micro transactions, then the number of source transactions in your transaction will be quite large. The QT client currently forces a fee on any transaction that is larger than a certain size. So you can't even spend the coins efficiently.

The fee is set by you in the configuration of your bitcoin app, not by the miners. They do however have the discretion of giving your transaction a lower priority when it comes to incorporating it into the blockchain. But once it's in, there's no difference anymore. After that 1^st confirmation, it'll confirm the other 5 just as fast as any other transaction.
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:44:58
Bitcoin may not make you rich anymore like it did before (though long term I don't think we've seen the top yet), but once the volatility dies down, bitcoin will settle into its deflationary pattern, meaning that it will slowly appreciate over time. So it's basically a good store of wealth that counteracts inflation in traditional currencies.

You want my honest opinion? Ok, but don't take this as investment advice. 
You ain't seen nothing yet. It's going to blow up with *epic* proportions. There's so many new companies starting, the [Bitcoin ATM]( the bitcoin over text [messaging]( the [bitcoin card]( (this thing will blow your mind), [BitPay]( for easily accepting bitcoin for merchants, and that's just *four* startups!
Then, as I mentioned earlier, there's the existing ones like [PayPal]( and Western Union. 
Just watch that PayPal video, seriously, if they felt threatened by bitcoin, would they say anything like that? Hell no, he'd fire up the FUD machine, but no. He's complimenting bitcoin and hinting at adding it as a funding instrument!
Anyway, like I said, don't take this as investment advice, but holy crap. Shit's just getting started.

1. tx messages do not contain the hash of the transaction itself. That would be redundant.
2. The block chain database only stores blocks, not any additional data. There is a block index that stores block hashes, and the UTXO (unspent transaction outputs) stores transaction hashes.
3. You can't compute a hash of a piece of data that contains that hash. That's like saying A = 5 + A and then expecting to get a concrete value for A.

I could see the devs switch hashing algorithm in that case. Sure, it would cause major disruption on the bitcoin network, but there are ways to protect it from threats like that.
