If that's what you want, buy and use DOGE.
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:25:42
You're obviously talking about DOGE, as it's faster and cheaper than Bcash. It's honest about being a joke too.
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:02:16
Don't see how that's relevant to the legitimacy of DOGE being superior to Bcash. Here's a relevant question: does Bcash have lower fees and faster transaction fees compares to DOGE?

If you're mad that they've put it back up, consider using other trackers. OnChainFX and LiveCoinWatch are good options.
CoinMarketCap also makes an absolute shit ton of money from ads for BitConnect and other terrible projects, so I wouldn't be surprised if they were paid to put the links back. If you don't like that, move away.

Let me introduce you to our Lord and saviour, [DOGE](

I heard BCC represents a good buying opportunity too. Putting a slice of that in your portfolio should do wonders for diversification. 
@_date: 2019-11-08 17:28:04
Where the hell did you get this idea from? What's your source? 
You can't transfer out, [but they explicitly note that they're buying it and storing it on your behalf](
@_date: 2019-11-08 11:41:03
Revolut uses a weighted average for their pricing last time I checked, so prices offered don't actually reflect the spot price on exchanges. Coupled with the high fee just makes it suck even more.

This post has some lousy recommendations. 
If you want to buy BTC as cheap as possible in the UK, sending GBP to Coinbase and buying on Coinbase Pro is still the best - 0.5% fee and free withdrawals.
If you want to use a debit or credit card, Wirex is much better than CEX. Max 1.5% in fees using a debit, but you'll get screwed on cash advance fees with a credit card.
Localbitcoins isn't exactly private either, is it? Needs KYC.
Somehow didn't mention Solidi/Bittylicious either. Lots of other cheap/quick sellers that can be compared with [BittyBot]( too. More information on the above in [this post on my blog]( but the above sums it up without the fluff.

Best practice is 100% to buy from places that allow you to actually withdraw and use your bitcoin as you please, but you're making accusations with zero proof and getting mad that people don't get it? Revolut at least does claim over and over to hold cryptocurrency that people are buying and storing with them.
@_date: 2019-11-08 12:26:38
Not a fan of Revolut at all, but they do *claim* to buy/sell/hold depending on what users are collectively doing (never seen any records/proof of that though).
@_date: 2019-11-08 15:15:03
Just going to copy/paste this from Revolut's cryptocurrency terms...










tl;dr: if your entire balance in Revolut is cryptocurrency, then it'll auto-exchange it to fiat and make the purchase.
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:08:58
I think you're right tbh. This does seem quite bad for cryptotokens distributed as part of an ICO, especially as it might just be the expectation (but not promise) of returns. Seemed good for cryptocurrencies (BTC, LTC, etc.,) though.
@_date: 2018-03-03 10:43:08
Don't think there can, technically, be spam in the Bitcoin network because it's by design net neutral. All traffic is valid if it is paid for. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 10:16:59
If you have a Coinbase account, you'll have a Coinbase Pro account too. If you're already registered and verified with Coinbase, you should be able to deposit GBP via Faster Payments. It's fast (&lt;1hour deposits) and the cheapest route available in the UK.
If you don't want to use Coinbase, then check out Solidi, Bittylicious, and BeyondCC. Rates vary day-to-day, but they're usually between 1% and 2% above the spot price on exchanges. You can just buy with a UK bank transfer (again, via Faster Payments) and have it sorted within 10-15 minutes. 
If you want more information, I try to keep [this list of the cheapest/best options \(in the UK\)]( up-to-date. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:47:44
Yeah, definitely wouldn't hold out hope for withdrawals anytime soon from Revolut.
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:28:05
Do yourself a favour and just get a decent broker. Saves all the bullshit as they just talk their way past it.

I'd pick a few problems with this piece (although it's the best thing MoneyWeek have put out about cryptocurrency since I've been reading), but my biggest gripe is the section that "Bitcoin isn't a currency". I understand where he's coming from, as uptake from the high street isn't high - yet. But his arguments in this section, and in general, are quite shakey. 
Just head over to [this site]( which lists sellers which accept cryptocurrency in the UK. Over time, I am becoming able to spend cryptocurrency in more and more places with ease. He desribes Bitcoin as a bartering tool, as if that's a bad thing. Currency itself is a bartering tool - it makes trade easier, and has no value beyond what we all agree to give it. Bah.
@_date: 2018-03-04 15:55:28
Looked into it and wrote a post about it [here]( 
Wouldn't recommend it at all as you can't take ownership of the cryptocurrency they allow you to buy/sell. If you store it with them and they fuck up, you'll also get no crypto back.
@_date: 2018-03-11 16:26:11
Head over to the wiki. It should help.
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:53:45
The simpler (and more likely imo) explanation is that people are dumb and get caught up in undeserved hype. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:24:35
There are some details in the FAQ for Revolut. They regularly refer to these investments as "cryptocurrency exposure" throughout their materials. They're seemingly targeting people that want to jump on the hype train, but don't want to learn (or just don't give a shit) about the tech or how to buy/store/spend it. Fair enough I guess - seems like a recipe for weak hands though.
I remember reading some releases which suggested they would develop functionality to allow withdrawals to other wallets, but can't find a timeline now. In the current state, they hold all their cryptocurrency in one big pot and just work on an internal ledger. Worth noting that any cryptocurrency holdings aren't insured like fiat, so you're fucked if they're security isn't up to scratch. All of these details, and more, are [in the FAQ.](

If the choice is between renting in the UK market and buying, you'd be mental not to buy. Especially at sub 2 percent. If you account for real inflation rate, that's a deal which is stupid NOT to take.
@_date: 2018-03-04 16:31:27
Probably quite low, but nevertheless a risk. Exchanges have had compromises and issues in the past, so it's not something to rule out. Just recently we've had NiceHash (not an exchange, but still) and Bitgrail hacked.
Possession of the private keys is the only way you can prove you're the legitimate owner of the funds. Without that, you're working on the faith of the 3rd party (Revolut) to kindly honour their agreement when you come back to sell. As far as the Bitcoin network is concerned, if Revolut owns your private keys, then it's their bitcoin - not yours. You're handing 100% control to a 3rd party if you don't own your keys.
Do they have malicious intent? 99% probably not. But you're putting trust in a 3rd party when you really don't need to. In some early articles, there was some mention they were going to add in the ability to send in/out of their service at a later date - but not mentioned in more recent docs. I'd imagine they do want to add the ability to send in/out, but probably need more development time or time to resolve other issues.

I see this perspective around a lot, but I disagree. Gold, oil, etc., all have uses beyond value storage. BTC doesn't - it's just about being an exchange medium, which is much closer to what I consider a currency being than something like gold or oil.

This gets reposted over and over.
I skimmed the [report]( and I can't even find this 21%. Only this: 


It's probably a biased report. I asked for data/more information and I've received no reply. Unless we understand the wording of the question (and the response options), I think this is useless and misleading.
