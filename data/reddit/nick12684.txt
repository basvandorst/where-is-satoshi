Competition breeds quality and they would stand to make out better, creating a legitimate app to do things better than coinbase can. Over creating some knock off app just so they can rob people's Bitcoin.  I mean the code is open source and coinbase has given them permission to use their name, so it doesn't make any sense that this is poor judgement and would cause more problems, from any sort of market perspective.

You are at risk of falling when you climb this ladder, This hot coffee is hot. I mean its redundant right? The Riskiness of Bitcoin is the barrier to entry of it. Its not like accidently grabbing the skim milk instead of the 1% and getting home to realize you bought the wrong milk! It takes some understanding before you can even successfully buy any Bitcoin, let alone lose your shirt or the kids college money in it.

Yes, but if people are even contemplating investing in a business venture, don't you think most (if not all) people would educate themselves the best they can before doing it? I don't think hardly anyone would be of the mindset of risk being the furthest thing from their mind and not understating what they are involving themselves in before they go through with it. These anti-Bitcoiners talk as if people are children and can't make any educated or rational decision, and must  have their attention diverted from the 'scary Bitcoin'.

Bitcoin has value the same way anything else has value; because your mind perceives it valuable in some way and for some subjective reason. 
All value is subjective and that is why Bitcoin, gold, paper money, or even the pants that (I hope) you are wearing has value.  
Bitcoin (as with gold or paper money) is just your subjective value and marginal utility objectified or transcribed in the physical world.

I thought about that. I have a Kindle Fire and there is not a lot of Bitcoin options for the Kindle and only has Wifi, but I'm looking into that anyway. The Kindle has an internet browser. So how about a web-based app?

I kind of like the idea of providing the price to be deposited in the wallet, via the QR code with a tablet idea, over everyone to pay for their food and drinks by table and via blockchain idea. It does provide a better check and less risky, but more complicated and complicated is the last thing I need to make this even go smooth. The bring cash to pay for the bitcoin bill is a good idea, but I'm not sure what the bill is going to be like. $300, $2000, maybe even more than I have in my checking account. So until we come up with a better idea, they are going to either have to take a check or sit on the Bitcoins for themselves.  Thanks for the input.

Sorry, I meant that they are willing to forgo the traditional way people pay for things, but just for us with this event. How much more work is required on their end for bitpay, than using my (the group's) Coinbase and me just cutting them a check at the end of the night?

I don't understand why people are getting downvoted for asking a question and giving evidence to support a legitimate point. Maybe Bitcoin dogmatism.....

Thank you.  I used this site/service.  It was easy and the transaction went very smoothly.  Pleasantly satisfied.  Thanks again!

Yes,  I understand that.  But don't you think that people will seek alternatives when BTC hits a certain value and continues to go up? 
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:35:35
Thanks! exactly what I was looking for.

Great,  but such things are subjective.
