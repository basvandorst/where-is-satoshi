ad spam? I'm just auser who happens to have Bitcoins in Kraken.
And I never had a problem using Kraken...
@_date: 2014-02-14 19:15:24
yes exactly!  Is this kind of behaviour handled by BTC markets? 
@_date: 2014-02-14 19:03:32
I'm on Kraken and i had my first good buy and sold shortly after. So my question is: if someone is buying a huge amount of BTC (50 or st) at a certain limit, it seems almost certain that this limit wont be broken for a long period and the price stabilises at one end and after some time people are buying again and the price goes up again - is this some kind of a trick to boost the price?

But gold isn't really lost. It's still there and can be found. Good luck with that with an encrypted wallet or a broken hard drive.

You can share your private keys to another person, but that's it.
Wouldn't recommend it tho :)

I pay nothing for my visa and even got money for having an account.  I can also withdraw my money off almost every ATM. 
EC card is the way to pay in Germany, because VISA charges huge fees and everyone has an EC card.

I guess I'm not able to understand this because beer is legal at 16 where I live. :/
Who complaints about beer?

Yes, even WoW money has a worth for players.
It's worth something because people believe it's worth something. Same with Bitcoin.

It's a valid concern - no reason to downvote him.
This is new ground.

Thank you for keeping us informed! :) 
I think that's one great way to built the trust that bitcoin really needs!

regret making profit is the worst you can do.
Bitcoin could've dropped to 1 cent and could be dead.
