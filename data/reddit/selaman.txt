Google search bitcoin atm in your area 
@_date: 2017-08-06 09:23:11
I got that from the Coin ATM Radar app
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:20:52
I live in Houston. I thought there was an Athena Atm somewhere around BW8 and 45 that does sell

When I can go to McDonald's and buy a cheeseburger with bitcoin then it will be mainstream. Or Starbucks coffee. Or Walmart. 
I'm not saying these places are good or anything but once you see major companies offering services for it you will know its mainstream. Like every Walmart has a bitcoin atm.

Straight cash homie no ID

Mine Monero. To mine bitcoin because of the difficulty now you need powerful mining tools. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 12:18:36
With fees you can set the priority level in most apps whether faster or slower. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:40:26
I don't know where you live but you can buy and sell at ours for 4% fee. There are tons available 
@_date: 2017-08-07 22:56:19
show a picture?
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:34:31
Google it. It's from dragon ball z anime
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:51:57
You can use this website and it will show the fees for it as well.
@_date: 2017-08-03 12:14:58
But do you have to have large scale operations to make profit that is significant 
@_date: 2017-07-30 04:37:10
It's just a mess over there right now more than usual. People who have waited until the last minute are really going to be in a precarious situation. 
They want you to keep your coins with them and the private keys included. Moving so many bitcoin is not good in their eyes. 
What do you use for storage? 
@_date: 2017-07-31 09:28:35
Wickr won't give you a phone number to use 
@_date: 2017-07-31 00:27:20
( they also have an app. Will show exchange rates for both buying and selling as well as limits. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 12:04:34
Local Bitcoins, Paxful or an ATM
@_date: 2017-07-30 01:43:49
They lure you in by making it relatively quick to get verified and buy a lot and low fees but I have never seen a exchange consistently go down and back up and have issues 
@_date: 2017-07-31 04:46:26
Mycelium for Android. Breadwallet for iOS. Electrum for computer. Hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:40:09
Any sold in USA will need ID
@_date: 2017-07-31 00:31:42
Both are as good as it gets for non hardware wallets. And both easily integrate a hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 01:43:10
Yeah did mine 0300 got them 1620
@_date: 2017-07-31 04:29:51
Get the burner app for your phone and use any number you want. Phone verification is usually good up to $3000 to $4000 dollars. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 00:30:55
It brings good discussion and exchange of ideas and principles. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:19:11
If that's the case I will just put it all on my SSD. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 11:51:13
Apparently Coinbase has always had issues with downtime off and on just never this severe and widespread. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 06:18:38
I meant I can spend bitcoin here and in South Korea without needing to buy local currency 
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:48:35
@_date: 2017-07-30 12:03:42
I only use hot wallets when I buy bitcoin from ATMs or local people. I immediately put them into Electrum when I get home. I never carry more on my phone than I am willing to lose. 
If you connect a Ledger Nano S or a Trezor with Mycelium you have more security because the app would require a physical signing from the hardware wallet before spending the bitcoin. You can receive bitcoin all day without the HW wallet connected. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 05:57:23
Ethereum, Litecoin and Monero
@_date: 2017-07-31 09:27:56
Now I know why Coinbase is used so much by big companies. It's founded by one of them. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:34:14
Should I wait until after the 1st to put my coins on there? 
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:11:36
Can it be run from second hard drive or does it have to be my main one? I have huge HD for storage and SSD for OS
@_date: 2017-07-30 05:23:29
Paxful has so many buy options and is really fast when going from their wallet to one of yours. 
Local Bitcoins is good too but watch out for scammers. 
Bitsquare.io is the best though for privacy.. But you have to have coins already because they require deposit before buy and sell. 
I live in USA so I would say Gemini or Bitterex. Exodus wallet I have heard good things about. It's an exchange as well as a wallet system. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 01:23:42
Bought coins through Paxful today. Went from the wallet to Electrum less than five minutes before confirmation. 
Waited 14 hours Coinbase to Electrum today. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 12:32:53
PM if interested 
@_date: 2017-07-30 01:20:43
What time did you order 
@_date: 2017-07-30 05:49:57
It's not necessarily the *speed* but the separation from corporate banks and governmental oversight (somewhat) that keep people doubling down on bitcoin. I mean just the fact that you can buy Domino's pizza or 10oz of Credit Suisse Gold Bar with bitcoin is where the draw is. 
Plus it's universal. I don't have to convert one fiat to another. I don't need to turn USD to Euro or Pounds. Bitcoin is bitcoin no matter where I go. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:47:57
LBC, Paxful or ATM
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:24:08
$65 will get it done. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 05:16:38
I have a Ledger Nano S and is was worth every Satoshi. Would love to have the Blue but $250 is $250. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 04:39:56
So many better exchanges and buy/sell marketplaces than Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:19:44
Withdrew bitcoin at 0300 received to Electrum at 1620. 14 hours. 
Never using Coinbase again. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 05:53:34
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:18:15
okay. starting the download
@_date: 2017-07-30 11:54:43
No other exchange consistently has technical issues like Coinbase. 
I believe it's because it's the most known and used even among newbie crypto users and is the main source for companies trying out bitcoin (such as Gyft for gift cards)  
@_date: 2017-07-30 04:38:01
Did Paxful purchase today. Three minutes tops. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:49:46
Could it be stored on an external hard drive 
@_date: 2017-07-30 13:27:20
I will PM you. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:19:43
How is the wallet integration. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 12:21:17
Buy local or buy with cash online and use exchanges sparingly. This last week with Coinbase and other exchanges has opened my eyes a lot. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 00:19:16
Mycelium for mobile. Electrum for desktop. Ledger Nano S or Trezor for hardware. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:11:32
Should I torrent download or repositories links? On Linux mint
