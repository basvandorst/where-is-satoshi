For sure. We'll check it out!
@_date: 2019-07-31 01:53:27
Love the content and agree 100%
@_date: 2018-01-27 22:56:53
Ah ok thanks for the heads up. And no i don't believe there's an html version as far as I know. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:19:43
not that I know of :P
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:02:48
And do let me know if you have any questions. I am definitely not a tax professional though! Just here to share my research and hopefully it helps someone!
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:22:47
How sure are you about this? I talked to a crypto specialized CPA and he told me that you cant claim like kind in 2017 either. Not for crypto at least. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:39:31
My pleasure. And I wish wish wish we could claim like kind.

@_date: 2017-12-30 01:56:01
yea i've seen that before but it goes against what other articles/CPAs have said :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:19:01
Would love to hear your thoughts/opinions on this as well!
@_date: 2018-09-30 06:55:11
Thank you so much. This is immensely helpful 
@_date: 2018-09-30 02:36:09
I purposefully did not post it in that subreddit :P
@_date: 2018-09-30 02:05:42
Really? An immediate downvote? This article is not spammy or promotional whatsoever! 
@_date: 2018-09-30 07:17:51
We will make the changes tomorrow 
@_date: 2018-09-17 06:11:27
Thank you for watching!! 
@_date: 2018-09-30 03:42:21
ok i will do some more research and then correct it soon - thanks for the heads up!
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:19:36
makes sense
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:20:02
my pleasure, and yes its gonna be a hassle
@_date: 2018-09-30 05:25:41
Right, but are you saying that paragraph is inaccurate? 
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:22:14
I read the article. How confident are you about this designation though? I read elsewhere included talking to a crypto CPA that you can't claim like-kind in 2017 either. 
@_date: 2018-09-30 03:15:37
It's a pretty long article. We tried to provide the whole picture - how it works, current limitations, and why we're optimistic 
@_date: 2018-09-30 03:32:31
Wait, I thought you open up channels with peers that you know and then when you want to send it to someone else you are linked through peers that already have channels open with each other?
@_date: 2018-08-21 16:34:07
Hahaha dang it 
@_date: 2018-08-04 03:11:25
Thank you for watching! 
@_date: 2018-08-25 20:51:16
Or on reddit 
@_date: 2018-09-30 02:35:42
Hahah I see 
@_date: 2018-08-25 21:02:18
But I can't post a summary with the link can I? Or I'll need to write it as a comment 
@_date: 2018-08-04 20:01:46
Keep on waiting then 
@_date: 2018-08-25 20:51:06
Summary where? In the video description? 
@_date: 2018-08-21 08:04:19
if it goes to $0 can I buy all of it and dub myself Satoshi Nakamoto?
@_date: 2019-03-07 15:18:25
That can go under the altcoin section lol
@_date: 2019-03-03 04:04:46
Looool send it to me I'll take care of it for you :P
@_date: 2019-03-15 13:32:17
@_date: 2019-03-07 15:17:13
Lol that can go under the altcoin section
@_date: 2019-11-06 16:48:05
How is it a FUD headline?
@_date: 2018-10-11 14:55:58
Lol I see what you mean. Well I meant to convey that I used to not until I dove in and did deep research on it lol
@_date: 2019-11-06 16:18:13
Yea we mentioned that it may have been orchestrated FUD haha
@_date: 2018-06-20 07:00:40
Glad it helped! 
@_date: 2019-08-29 18:35:30
What are you referring to?
@_date: 2019-10-09 14:59:59
Some ppl yes. Haha
@_date: 2019-10-08 22:14:46
Well it was made by them but the content in the infographic is valuable and free
@_date: 2018-06-19 22:55:18
Why the dislike? Just trying to make some educational content to hopefully help everyone...
@_date: 2018-06-06 22:58:29
I know this isn't explicitly about Bitcoin but the general lessons learned can apply to any crypto wallet so I thought this would be potentially helpful to some other ppl here!
@_date: 2019-02-11 21:31:52
Thank you. Took a long time to research and distill down haha 
@_date: 2019-06-06 22:54:36
Lol what do you mean?
@_date: 2019-02-11 21:54:55
Haha yep I made it with my teammate Adriaan. Thanks for your kind comments
@_date: 2019-08-30 04:48:26
Do you have another preferred option?
@_date: 2019-02-12 02:07:23
Yay thanks that means a lot to us
@_date: 2019-12-17 21:35:30
He might be Satoshi
@_date: 2019-04-15 19:00:30
Ok thanks for the tip, I'll be sure to do that next time
@_date: 2019-04-15 19:47:53
Lolol I think he said he was going to outsource it
@_date: 2019-04-11 22:51:45
My pleasure!!
@_date: 2019-04-12 05:33:12
I think for this upcoming one it will be big but future ones after this next one might not be as impactful
@_date: 2019-04-12 02:41:51
Yay thanks for watching
@_date: 2019-04-12 16:30:40
Thank you!
@_date: 2019-04-15 19:40:13
Craig Wright? Good point
@_date: 2019-04-11 23:12:02
yay glad you liked it!
@_date: 2019-04-16 17:32:13
Lol I guess so. But some of them are at least trying to add value through innovation.
@_date: 2019-04-15 19:00:05
they are the biggest scams in your opinion?
@_date: 2019-04-16 01:49:45
Yep sure looks like that! :)
@_date: 2019-04-11 23:58:15
yay thank you! :)
@_date: 2019-04-11 22:52:11
Yep excited for that too
@_date: 2018-03-26 05:22:01
Where does it say to do it on a connected machine? 
@_date: 2018-03-26 03:47:19
Yay, glad you like it! 
@_date: 2019-01-24 16:56:33
Lol why? I'm a liberal but I watched a lot of his content and I can't find too much that I find is incendiary or that I disagree with completely. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 16:56:47
I thought the libertarian Bitcoin type like JP
@_date: 2019-01-24 17:02:19
Did you watch the video? The person is chatting about censorship resistance and patreon and then donates a little bit to Jordan Peterson. No one is begging for donations. Lol
@_date: 2019-01-05 23:37:12
Ah I see that makes a lot of sense. Thanks for sharing your experience! 
@_date: 2019-01-24 16:25:02
Are you not for free speech and censorship resistance? 
@_date: 2019-01-24 16:19:03
What do you mean by Shit donating propaganda? 
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:39:31
thank you :)
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:20:59
Ah but it depends on the client that you eventually use to transfer your funds, right? I'll add an disclaimer. Thanks for the heads up
@_date: 2017-10-02 16:40:25
Im not deep enough into the debate to be able to fairly take a side. I just wanted to break it down for confused investors like me who just want to figure out which bitcoin I should be buying haha 
@_date: 2017-09-12 15:29:15
disclaimer added!
@_date: 2017-10-02 22:33:15
The market acts irrationally though. Bitcoin cash shot up to $800ish at one point while BTC stayed roughly the same. I sold my BCH that I got from the split and made extra money from that. Lol
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:27:22
You have regular BTC. If a fork happens, you will now have 2 different types. It's up to Gemini to determine which of those two (if not both) you can access though! Just keep an eye out for announcements by them.
@_date: 2017-10-02 20:38:46
Thanks for the note! 
@_date: 2017-10-02 20:41:55
By the way is it 100% decided that there won't be replay protection? Or might it still get added later? That piece of info is eluding me. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 22:39:43
For bitcoin cash and BTC yep. Equal amounts. I had it on an exchange that supported the fork
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:25:04
um if that happens then Litecoin is going to the moon, imho
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:17:48
Yep I added the addendum to read up on replay attacks. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 17:12:58
We're on the same boat. I was super confused until I spent a lot of time researching and asking questions haha 
@_date: 2017-10-02 20:08:45
Someone's gonna be pissed off no matter how neutral I tried to be. *shrugs* I just want lambos 
@_date: 2019-09-11 04:15:24
What's their special draw for crypto ppl?
@_date: 2017-10-02 20:13:23
I gave an overview of the situation and told viewers that they should definitely do more research because I couldn't fit everything into one short video. Why do ppl on the internet always get so heated about stuff. Geez. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:25:27
will they want to though? I thought part of the reason they like BTC so much is because they own a lot of BTC... lol 
@_date: 2017-10-02 18:44:29
Yes... I was super confused by all that. Haha no joke. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 19:03:32
My pleasure! 
@_date: 2017-10-02 20:38:37
I'll be sure to add an addendum/note about that in the next couple of hours. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:44:12
Is he a Core dev or the uncle of a Core dev? Hahaha (dont get me wrong I like the Core devs but still, this guy is getting so worked up)
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:26:34
I dont have a Ledger Nano so I can't comment. But I think as long as you don't spend any coins after the fork until the dust settles, you should be able to switch back and forth between the chains right? Because technically you have a balance on both.
@_date: 2019-09-07 13:34:49
@_date: 2017-10-02 16:29:01
yay thanks!
@_date: 2019-09-26 23:00:23
Yea I know but I finally took the time to do a deep dive and break it down for everyone haha
@_date: 2017-10-02 20:48:35
Will do! 
@_date: 2019-09-20 22:52:54
That is a great point indeed
@_date: 2017-10-02 20:18:26
Umm I did say that ppl were wondering why the 2x portion is even necessary because the big blockers already have their bitcoin cash. So no I did not adopt the narrative that it must be doubled. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 17:20:16
@_date: 2017-10-02 20:00:56
Hmm I may need to add an addendum to clarify that point then. Thanks for the heads up. I didn't fully connect the dots in terms of your second point until now. It wasn't malicious I promise! 
@_date: 2017-07-18 09:39:57
