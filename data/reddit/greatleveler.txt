I used to work customer service one of their competitors, and I can tell you first hand one of the most difficult aspects of the job was dealing with international orders where for fraud-prevention reasons, we simply could not accept foreign credit cards from a lot of countries. The only solution they had was to use a bank wire at cost to the customer, which takes days and costs $20-100. I seriously think that bitcoin, if well implemented, could really solve this problem and help ecommerce sites reach more international customers. It would be extremely beneficial to both parties.

I don't think so. From what I gather, it has more to do with the idea of encrypted messaging with bitcoin-style addresses. But someone please correct me if I'm wrong

Hi Jimmy Chen. Believe it or not, I read about your micronation randomly after getting interested in micronations when I learned that a small micronation in Australia was established via a legal loophole to enable the sovereign to do something silly like sell more milk than is allowed or something to that effect. Anyway, good luck with your cryptocurrency efforts.

Banks or safety deposit boxes? A fractional reserve bank defeats the purpose of bitcoin.

Shouldn't the possibility of arbitrage remove this possibility provided other exchanges are actually functional and liquid?
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:26:19
A bank run is totally different because the total amount of money is not actually there as it has been accounted multiple times.

I'm not saying you shouldn't buy back in. I'm just predicting a downturn. I love bitcoin as much as the rest of you, I just think it's not done falling.
@_date: 2013-03-30 14:54:43
I think you're leaving out some steps. If bitcoins are hoarded, then fewer of them circulate, making them scarce, making their value more concentrated, making them more sought after. Yet these hoarders are really acting as speculators, who are taking risks by holding the bitcoins in case they are more valuable at a later date. If they decide that this isn't the case, they will try to cash out as quickly as possible, dumping a ton of bitcoins into circulation at once, making the price go very low to the point that people would recognize an opportunity to buy bitcoins when they are cheap.

Good for them. These were the people who were busy mocking Apple during it's major slump in the late 90's who are now wishing they bought stock.

Because it encourages banks to gamble deposits with the promise that they will print more money to make up the difference when it comes time to pay for the fact that there is not enough money for everyone to withdraw at the same time.

Bitcoins are in the hands of successful miners. These aren't mainly rich people, most are people who were paying attention a few years ago and took a risk with it. In general it's not the wealthy who are doing all the mining, but even if it was, that's not really a problem.
The bitcoins aren't valuable to the owners until they are spent anyway. If they invest their real wealth into mining equipment and acquire bitcoins, they're either going to sell those bitcoin, buy products with the bitcoins, or hold them in anticipation of the price going up. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:26:09
I think though, that people are begging for a viable reason to jump ship from Mt. Gox over it. These are the kind of situations that a real competitor can swoop in and say, "Remember last April?" and get some market share, and Mt. Gox will be forced to hire some scalability engineers, add capacity, etc. As pissed as everyone is right now, it's still good for bitcoin.

Unfortunately, it's not ready to be a currency right now. I believe it will one day, but right now putting real purchasing power into a bitcoin and walking away is just being negligent in my view.
I currently own 0.009 bitcoins. I'll probably buy if it gets low again and sell when it gets high. That's good for me and for bitcoin. Speculators will bring stability.

Microtransactions are big too. A lot of credit card fees are structured as something like $0.30 + 1%. For a 99c purchase, that's your profit margin.

In what capacity?
@_date: 2013-04-03 00:43:02
Through the manipulation of central banks, governments can take the people's money by printing new money and purchasing assets, inflating the currency. This credit expansion creates business cycles that drive the middle class into poverty and the poor into worse poverty.

How do you know that there shouldn't be 10x as much gold in that vault? What makes your holding preference better than someone else's?
Those gold bars are there for a reason, and they are serving a valid purpose, namely the fact that regardless of how many receipts or credits of ownership of gold you issue, there's still just that much gold in the vault. If you lack confidence in your gold receipts, you can go collect your gold. 
Even more, central banks can make currency appear out of thin air and inject it in to the market by purchasing assets, like gold.

It seems like the miners themselves would then have the most to lose by granting themselves the ability to monopolize the market. They *might* be able to pull off a successful fraud or two but in doing so they would kill the goose that lays the golden egg, since the price of a bitcoin would drop incredibly. These days miners already have a decent amount invested, so there are built in financial incentives for honesty.

But a bitcoin isn't worth the average value you can trade for on all exchanges. It's worth the particular value of a particular exchange that you choose to use.

As the margins on speculation diminish, so will the volatility. 
@_date: 2013-07-21 11:43:04
There has to be a way to get coins out initially, and it can't rely on some central authority since that would defeat the purpose. Therefore the difficulty of the problem serves as a gatekeeper.
The average person doesn't need to mine gold to find it valuable, most people just buy it.

Actually, I think it's just the opposite. If you are sufficiently large, you have a lot of capital invested in what you're currently doing you want to drive the millions of little guys out so that you don't have to compete.

I agree that the bitcoin market is based on speculation right now, but I think that what we will see is that a lot of money will change hands and the market will oscillate much like other currencies, while it waits for industry to make it more spendable. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:23:11
But if you can anticipate that it is going down for at least a few weeks, you should sell now and buy it back then the price is lower.

Is anarcho-socialism an opt-in system in which members voluntarily collectively own means of production, but they can opt out without state involvement? If so, that sounds kind of like an employee owned company in a larger context of anarcho-capitalism.

The current elite is rich because they bribe the government to get kickbacks and to destroy their competition. It's not a market phenomenon. 
It's a fundamentally good thing for those who take the risks to receive the rewards. It's a part of entrepreneurship.

I take it then that in order to actually confirm the legitimacy of a bitcoin, you would need to accept it through the blockchain. It would be unwise to accept a physical bitcoin as payment because you have no way of knowing it is a real bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-16 20:10:37
Wow, reactionary, considering that its still trading above the initial ore-boom price. If they want to claim that the problem is deflationary they should first prove that bitcoins are disappearing from the economy faster than they are mined: not proven not likely. The boom was based on speculation, and the subsequent correction not deflation. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:18:09
Wait, how can you be an Austrian in thinking that business cycles, and almost everything negative in the economy is facilitated by government while also thinking that the government should own the means of production and distribute wealth? This is a sincere question.

Actually, yes. If I could choose to never be taxed again in any capacity and be responsible for paying for basic infrastructure through private means I would do so in a heartbeat.

I hate to say it, but I think it's still going down. If I thought it was going to be worth $250 in the future, I'd wait for the next uptick over $100 and sell until it goes down some more, then buy and hold. The losses are lost now. Holding is a bet that it's either going to go back up *now*, that you're not going to be able to predict a lower point, or that you're convinced it's done dropping. As an internet guy with no money riding on it, my advice means very little.

More market data will help speculators find it more predictable and reduce the profit margin in the Forex aspect of bitcoin.

So then it ultimately depends on the reputation of the vendor. 
Would it be correct to say that it would still be more secure than a banknote since a physical bitcoin would lay claim to a particular bitcoin as opposed to being redeemable for a bitcoin? If so, this fact would prevent a physical bitcoin vendor from holding only a fractional reserve for those physical bitcoins which are actually redeemed. Otherwise the vendor could, in theory, speculate the markets using bitcoins which they've already sold in physical form.
