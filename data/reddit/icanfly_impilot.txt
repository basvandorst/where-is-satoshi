Aren't these all post-mode only?  Any what does that even mean?

So a few trades will go through and then it'll be paused again lol

For me it took about three to four hours I think, can't remember exactly

Yeah, I'm trying, but coindick won't let me sell it

I appreciate the comment.  With transactions taking time in an era of instant gratification sometimes I get a little carried away with unneeded worry.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:53:52
 I just want to know when I can sell it to get out of bcash.  Really frustrating to have it locked up.

Thanks for the responses, decided to run some errands and it has now gone through.  I guess it was the volume.  Today has been a bit crazy...

But the difference is the psychological aspect of the average consumer.  Right now with credit cards the consumer doesn't think about the fees because the merchant pays them, and so long as the price the consumer sees is reasonable to them they'll buy.  Even if the price were lower, the fact that fees will apply after is going to turn consumers off.  
But, to devils-advocate myself, people still buy tickets in spirit airlines despite the fees and crap service, so in the end who knows.  I just think that if BTC is to catch on as a main stream currency there will need to be a mechanism for the merchants to pay he fees rather than the consumer.  (That may exist already, I'm pretty new to the BTC world).

The price increase makes my wife nervous because she expects it to suddenly crash to zero.  I've got enough BTC to be happy for now, so I told her for now I wouldn't put any more in, but she is very risk averse.  She does like the gains so far though...

Yup, I've been waiting over 8 hours for mine to switch from pending to confirmed.

Thanks for the anti-fud, needing a bit at the moment lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:28:35
If I had the faintest idea how to do that I would, but I really don't know how.
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:24:18
I'm past 10 hours waiting.  Pretty frustrating.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:23:36
What are child pays, how do I do that?
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:23:07
I would if I could but I don't know how.  The location I sent from says I have non and the locating I'm sending to says it hasn't received.

Edwards: Why the big secret? People are smart. They can handle it.
Kay: A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky dangerous animals and you know it. Fifteen hundred years ago everybody knew the Earth was the center of the universe. Five hundred years ago, everybody knew the Earth was flat, and fifteen minutes ago, you knew that humans were alone on this planet. Imagine what you'll know tomorrow.

For the noobs out there, where *should* we store our BTC/ETH/LTC if we have it?  Is that the cold hardware storage?  Not sure how it works or what I need.  Thanks.
@_date: 2017-09-02 20:27:19
I just bought at $4607 and the dip has dipped a little more, I'd certainly buy now if you have the means and are willing to assume the risk.
@_date: 2017-09-04 01:06:53
That may not be an option for everybody 
@_date: 2017-09-23 00:36:28
Can you explain this reasoning?  Just based on buy orders vs sell orders?
@_date: 2017-10-22 07:05:42
$25,000 could be the dip?

Just bought .5 at 4,607 - buy the dip (almost) and HODL to the moon!

I like the idea of following the circadian rhythm more closely, that's certainly one of he benefits of a siesta!

I was unaware of that, this isn't being talked about.  So bitcoin and already existing crypto are effectively dead in China, then?  Really shitty, especially considering the number of people there who I'm sure want in on the fun.  
@_date: 2017-09-06 19:05:08
Aaaand bookmarked.

Thanks, it sounds like I might make the switch to GDAX and find cold storage, still don't really understand that though.  Is hardware cold storage a physical hard drive which you can unplug for safe keeping?  I have this vague understanding of how bitcoin/eth/blockchain works,  but really I don't understand how it works (despite how many blockchain for beginner type articles I read).

I look forward to a future graph in which August 2017 looks like November 2013, perhaps minus the marked drop-off...
@_date: 2017-09-01 00:42:09
This I think little chart may have be very helpful to me if not just to get me to ask some questions.  I started getting involved with BTC/ETH about two and a half months ago and read about this wallet and that storage and this fee and blah blah but really don't understand it.  Time to learn.  I, for now, have a Coinbase account.  Is Coinbase safe, but perhaps a rip off?  Is GDAX safe and better, and what is hard storage and do I need it?  Any help is appreciated.
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:36:49
To be completely fair, I read this as bitcoin being transferred to fiat at the time of purchase, not the purchase being the exchange of bitcoin solely.
@_date: 2017-09-26 15:58:55
Why are some people spelling "hodl" as "hold"?
@_date: 2017-09-07 03:43:49
Also, everybody who currently owns bitcoin would have to be willing to sell it to them.  Right?
@_date: 2017-09-01 02:51:05
So in that case having btc in Coinbase is bad and I should find another storage solution, correct?

It would be similar to everybody operating on UTC or Zulu time.  Some industries (aviation, notably) already do run in a universal time.  The challenge is incorporating it into day to day for conformity and order, standard time zones so that a point on a clock or watch matches the time of day.

I'd be in if it were on the realitysportsonline.com platform with a current year prize pool as well as a prize pool for the first team owner to win multiple championships...  (.06 buy in, .05 towards this year's prize pool, .01 towards multi-champ pool...)
Would have to be a realitysportsonline.com format for me to do yet another league, though... best format by far!
