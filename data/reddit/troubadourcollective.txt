No.  its was the collapse of the CDO's that caused the StoHTF, which in turn sent the CDS's on the holders of the CDO's to skyrockets, which caused the creditors to call in their loans which caused many a de facto bankruptcy which ultimately led to the near-meltdown.
This is an oversimplification.. the point simply being CDS's were not the culprit per se but rather an intermediary in a larger crisis which would have been a lot worse but for their existence and participation.

A CDS is more akin to an insurance policy.
Accordingly, introduces no more risk into the market than an actual insurance policy does.  It merely transfer risk from the risk averse to the risk-keen.
You see, a CDS, like many derivatives, is an Over the Counter product which is traded between 2 counterparties exchanging the risk that the underlying issuer(company) defaults on its obligations.  In the strictest sense, whatever happens affects the two counterparties exclusively - no one else.
Of course, if the full magnitude of a companys default is transferred to a CDS seller then there is a contagion affect in so far as the seller may not have the ability to pay up in the event the issuer defaults, which means the cds buyer initiates legal action which could result in the seller also going poof which could then trigger a dominoes effect throughout the creditor/debtor chain.
However, this is unrealistic and unlikely to happen to any significant degree as to cause the whole system to collapse.
If anything CDS's transferred and dissapated risk across a spectrum of counterparties who were collectively more able to sustain the hit than if the default were to be shouldered by a single/few  counterparty/ies.
If there is any derivative capable of bringing down the system, it would be the IRS, not the CDS.
