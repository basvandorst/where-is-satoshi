Good points. Both parties would need to trust each other. For whatever reason sender wants to get back his/her BTC they could. 
Originally, my thought was for micro size bits of BTC to be shared like 100 bits via links that could be printed as well. More as a way to give and share rather than transact and trade. Scan and collect BTC!

yep, it probably can never be used from trade but rather only gifting/tipping/goodwill...

Neat hw solutions. They could be software based to an extent. It seems as long as there is a trusted third party any method could work. Trusting and relying on a centralized party is another question.

Thanks for sharing BCtip. That’s pretty much the concept I was thinking about. Didn’t really go anywhere :-/

In this case the hat seller could refuse this payment option or download an app and verify it. Another idea is if the paper was created by a service which can also authenticate its value. 
You’re right thoug probably not the most streamline in this scenario unless there was a trusted intermediary.

Great points. 
re: 2. You nailed it...it's about 74% that never gets used per BCTip:

It'll be the future once AI/Robots take over. We're better off investing than working unless we are in a highly specialized field that hasn't transitioned yet.

It's most likely a person with some predictive foresight but we'll see how many predictions actually come true or not. Could just be a damn good troll. Time will reveal the truth...

Any idea when Schnorr, Taproot, etc. might be released?

Add $BCC and $BTG forks and it's pretty much there!

So Square Inc. netted $555k from Bitcoin transactions in 2018 Q3 if you subtract the btc revenue from the btc costs.
