I think I'm going to include it for convenience anyway, but perhaps offer a guide on how to do similar operations with GPG
@_date: 2014-01-20 20:10:18
I'm not sure what you're asking! I do plan on including TC in the distro.
@_date: 2014-01-21 01:14:59
Could you point me in the direction of your favorite SSSS program/project? Thanks.
EDIT: [this one](
@_date: 2014-01-21 04:09:11
Why not? While it might be better to run on its own, running this distro as a guest would allow you to avoid installing BTC-related packages on your host machine, which might be attractive to some.
@_date: 2014-01-20 20:17:36
I do have quite a bit of Linux experience so I'm sure I'll be able to figure it out! Thanks a lot :-) 
@_date: 2014-01-18 19:25:44
Why is this any better than a paper wallet? 
@_date: 2014-01-20 21:08:47
Oh, jeez. I thought I added that. My mistake. Added!
By the way, if you're feeling paranoid, you might consider using something other than TC for encrypting your wallet as TC has not been fully audited. Take a look at using ``gpg`` and/or ``gpg-zip`` on ramfs.
@_date: 2014-01-20 20:51:54
Would you say ``bitaddress`` and ``bitcoinpaperwallet`` differ enough to warrant offering both? They're small so it doesn't really matter, just wondering.
@_date: 2014-01-20 21:20:16
@_date: 2014-01-21 04:49:46
Yup. Most likely I will provide a documented automated script with which to produce an iso. 
EDIT: And, to entice the community to help verify the signature of releases some proof-of-work process could donate BTC to verifiers. 
@_date: 2014-01-20 21:36:30
You shouldn't! I'm weighing a few options, but I'd love to open a discussion on how to prove the security of the distro.
@_date: 2014-01-20 21:20:29
@_date: 2014-01-20 19:24:36
added, thanks
@_date: 2014-01-23 17:31:13
I was thinking about using Docker.. would you suggest Ansible instead?
@_date: 2014-01-20 19:58:39
Offline cold-storage management, mining, wallet management, QR code generation, paper wallet generation, and encryption/decryption tools. 
What problems did you have with electrum? I'm sure I'll be able to sort it out!
@_date: 2014-01-21 00:56:01
I guess it would help maintain a gap between your day-to-day OS and bitcoin utilities. 
@_date: 2014-01-20 23:34:40
I have not used p2pool before, but it seems it would also require bitcoind to function. Is this true?
@_date: 2014-01-21 03:13:51
That's a really interesting approach - thanks for sharing. I will keep that in mind when I'm implementing the build system.

@_date: 2014-01-20 23:33:13
Gotchya! Added.

Developers making developers happy.

PSU bitcoin club?
@_date: 2014-01-21 16:58:58
Thanks for the gesture! I spent a few hours last night on the project and it' moving along nicely!
@_date: 2014-01-21 17:03:48
This is the idea I will be working with, but I don't think I'm going to be working with that project in particular. The Debian ReproducibleBuilds project is lacking automation, so I'm going to stay away from it for the time being and develop my own build scripts.


My first version will be a bash script for installation of apt packages. Later versions will most likely employ a more robust python script.
 
@_date: 2014-01-20 20:56:45
Added sparecoins.io, chromium, and lastpass. Did you mean to suggest that I add the [lastpass chrome extension]( Is that compatible with linux?
@_date: 2014-01-23 20:52:52
Ah, okay. I think I will stick with bash / python, as I'm more familiar with it.
@_date: 2014-01-20 21:21:33
Hadn't heard of this before, looks cool. Added!
@_date: 2014-01-21 01:14:13
My plan is to base the distro on a popular, very well supported distro like Ubuntu or Fedora so I can avoid redoing their work of adding device drivers and hardware auto-configuration. I could include a "network disabled" boot option for those that wish to use it as an "air-gapped" machine (ignoring the fact that a true air-gapped machine would not have network hardware at all).
@_date: 2014-01-20 23:32:58
Thanks! At some level there needs to be an element of trust. I think I will advertise this tool as an offline-only distribution, which would mitigate the damage that I could possibly do by injecting keyloggers, wallet interceptors, etc. I'll also provide build instructions for someone to roll their own if they don't trust it, and invite anyone to audit it and scan for malicious intent.

I meant from other users.

What's the license on this? I'd love to use it 
@_date: 2013-12-11 12:30:20
I'd consider one for $50
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:55:28
Can I trade BTC for USD on any of those other than localbitcoins?
