That's not very open minded. Bitcoin has its share of problems. There's no reason to think that it's the end-of-all.

You have to pay taxes on bitcoin transactions and gains. If you offer a service for $100 but accept payment in equivalent amount of bitcoins, it still counts towards your gross income and is liable for taxes. More info [here](

If company A pays company B in BTC, does the world know what amount was exchanged? Why is this a good idea?
@_date: 2014-08-23 00:25:11
The same thing that made the people angry at Jesus.
@_date: 2014-06-25 12:46:17
I see. So if you really wanted secrecy, you would do direct transactions, like you would do with cash currently, but digitally. Otherwise, most transactions will be through third party systems. 
In summary, most normal people will end up using third parties for (1) keeping their bitcoins and (2) transactions. 
@_date: 2014-08-24 16:35:12
You don't give away your private key when you pay with a credit card either.
@_date: 2014-08-28 20:10:50
So, lending $40 and keeping $60 would be OK, because in that case you are lending less than you have?

which cannot be ignored. I do not have to worry too much about keeping my credit card secure. If it gets stolen, so be it. I call my bank, and they have to cancel all fraudulent transactions.

How is it less risky than a credit card? With a credit card, the bank must bear the responsibility of any fraud. With bitcoin, all the responsibility is on my shoulders. That seems like a bigger headache.
@_date: 2014-08-26 21:33:21


In what sense is it not real? It's real cost that the miners bear, for which they are compensated partial through new bitcoin and partial through transaction fees. When the mining expires (as it does, mostly, in a decade or so), the fees will have to cover almost all of it.
@_date: 2014-06-23 23:18:42

Assuming I want a rapid confirmation and no mining reward, the transaction fee is not optional.
If you want to assume that BTC has completely replaced USD to answer my question, do so. 
@_date: 2014-08-26 13:46:45


Is that wishful thinking or is there any math behind it? What percent of current USD transactions will have to be replaced by BTC to have reasonable tx fees? There will also be more miners to offset more transactions. If there aren't enough miners, then the network becomes insecure.
Here is a [paper]( that addresses these issues.
It seems that people have been jumping on the bandwagon without thinking about the long-term prospects.

@_date: 2014-09-01 16:00:42


Doesn't change the fact that the bitcoin system expends $30 worth of resources per transaction.
@_date: 2014-08-26 13:18:08
Muhaha. Look [here]( It's between $20 and $30.
Currently it's paid by miner rewards, but when they run out, the sender foots the bill. 
And I am not talking about the next century. 93% of mining is over by 2024 and 99% by 2032.
@_date: 2014-09-01 04:42:14


Quite the opposite. If you break into someone's private space, you should be held accountable for your actions and charged.


The fact that I used a weak lock on my house does not make the actions of the thieves OK in any way. The thieves are the guilty ones. Same principle here.

Then you should read the only truly secure way to use bitcoins [here](
@_date: 2014-06-26 02:39:01


This makes the fees "optional" in name only. In reality, they are required, or else you can't do anything with your bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-08-26 12:52:23
The cost of a bitcoin transaction is about $30. When the miner rewards have reduced to nil, this will have to be provided by the sender. In that case, how do you plan on competing with the traditional ways of money transfer?
@_date: 2014-08-27 12:18:05


Couldn't they adjust miner rewards, making sure that there was enough incentive to mine, while keeping transfer fees in check?
@_date: 2014-08-26 12:56:36
Remember that each bitcoin transaction costs $25-30, paid by miner rewards. In the long run, when miner rewards have run out, the system you are advocating will require the payer to spend this much extra per transaction. Do you think that is sustainable?
@_date: 2014-08-18 15:29:35


Can you elaborate on the "benefit" part? 
@_date: 2014-08-26 12:55:04
Remember that each bitcoin transaction costs $30, which is currently paid by mining rewards. When the rewards run out, it will have to be paid by the sender. Does your business model or website have a plan to deal with it? Will your users be OK paying $30 extra for each transaction?
@_date: 2014-09-01 19:04:22
Whatever makes you feel happy, kid. You are rationalizing a clearly wrong action.
@_date: 2014-08-26 13:49:08

Sure, and this is not a new idea. Not sure how bitcoin comes into play here.
The author seems to be selling the idea of decentralization, encryption, and verification (but with bitcoins!), all of which vastly predate bitcoin. The real technology here is public key cryptography, which has existed for decades. Satoshi did not invent it.

Inflation also encourages investing. In a deflationary environment, I am better of storing my money under my bed, where it is useless, rather than investing it in new ventures.
Deflation also means that my debts grow over time, which makes me reluctant to take out loans, which in turn makes me reluctant to take risks, or limits the the risk-taking ability only to the wealthy who can afford the initial investment without taking loans.

I don't think it's deceptive. When you deposit $100 in a bank, the $100 stops becoming yours and becomes the bank's. From that point, the bank owes you $100, and agrees to pay whenever you demand. That's your checking account.
So, when you give $100 to the bank, you are lending the bank $100. Having lent the money, you don't get to control what the bank does with it. So the bank lends it further to someone else.

@_date: 2014-08-15 18:45:19


Tragedy of the commons. What you described are not incentives for me personally to use bitcoin. These are upsides of more bitcoin use in general. So I have an incentive to encourage others to use bitcoin, not use it myself.
@_date: 2014-06-25 23:36:54


Exactly. So at the point of sale, it hurts me to use bitcoin (no fraud protection) as opposed to using a credit card.
@_date: 2014-06-23 20:59:29
I think your security and privacy points are the same.  I'd argue that the non-reversibility of bitcoin transactions means that I need to worry much more about fraud and theft. Currently, I do not have to worry at all about my credit card being stolen, because I know that my bank will void the charges. With bitcoins, the burden of vigilence is on me, and I'd rather have fewer things to worry about.
@_date: 2014-08-16 16:10:26

May be with magnetic strip only credit cards. The world has moved on to credit cards with a chip where you have to personally authenticate the transaction. On top, you have a legal protection against unauthorized transactions.
Some credit cards use two-factor authentication by sending a one-time code to your phone that you use to authenticate. 
There are a multitude of ways to make credit cards more secure without having to invent a new currency.

Because of inflation, those who have dollars are incentivized to spend them, thus distributing dollars more widely. If I have the option to pay someone in USD or bitcoins, I have no reason to use bitcoins because I can hold onto them and their value will increase in the future befause of deflation. In this way, spreading bitcoins is disincentivized.
@_date: 2014-06-22 04:09:25

@_date: 2014-06-23 18:33:40

@_date: 2014-06-25 19:45:30
With bitcoins, the onus of security is on me. With banks and credit/debit cards, I have decent fraud protection (without paying for it), so if my card gets stolen, I just contact my bank and they cancel the fraudulent charges. Not just that, *by law*, they must cancel all the fradulent charges over $50. I have no such security with bitcoin. If I screw up, I am sold. I'd rather have fewer things to worry about.

About [the same as a bitcoin transaction](
I know, I know the cost is not borne by the sender, but only because new coins are being mined. After that expires, it will have to be borne by the sender. 
Also, doesn't detract from the fact that miners need to spend about an equivalent amount of money (in electricity costs etc) per transaction. Mining profits are razor thin.

Here's one reason. Currently, the verification of every bitcoin transaction takes $25-30 worth of resources. This is much less efficient than any of the other traditional means of money transfer. Currently the cost is not borne by the sender, but that does not negate the fact that a very real cost exists and must be accounted for. The equivalent overhead for a centralized system is negligible.
Therefore, in the long run, a bitcoin transfer will be more costly than a more traditional transfer. Sometimes, the added cost will be worth the anonymity or the lack of any middlemen, but that will be a niche.

Compare: the number of bitcoin stolen per year/ number of bitcoins in existence versus the number of USD stolen per year / number of USD in existence, and let me know if the professor is right or wrong.

93% of mining is over by 2024 and 99% by 2032. I sure hope to be alive by then.

How does that create a 'bitcoin nation'?

It's GitHub, but with bitcoins.
[I wonder how they came up with it?](

What about privacy?

Like it did with Mt. Gox, right?

People use credit cards online without worrying too much about security because banks offer fraud protection automatically. In fact, by law banks are required to waive fraudulent transactions. Therefore, there is very little burden of vigilance on me when I use my credit card online, and I don't personally have to resort to any complicated security mechanisms.

I thought one of the big advantages of bitcoin was that there was no third party who knew about your transactions. If you have to use coinbase or circle, or some other service, then that's a third party.

~~Mt. Gox~~ Coinbase.

You did not understand my question correctly. I am not saying that I would stop spending. But given that I can spend in USD or BTC, the deflationary nature of BTC disincetivizes spending in BTC because the BTC will be worth more tomorrow and the USD will be worth less.

Eyeing a 3% discount when the price fluctuates by 20% in a day is irrational.
