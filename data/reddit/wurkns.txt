How long have you been waiting to post this?

I understand that you need the longest branch. But in this attack an attacker would overload the majority of the network with invalid transactions in order (perhaps crashing them) to GET the longest branch.
Thanks for the Forbes suggestion, I presume you ment [this one](

Great looking phones for a decent price.

No, I genuinely don't understand how it works. I can think of a lot of ways that the blockchain might work with gaming, but what's the purpose of this site?
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:34:37
I'm not an historian or an economist, so I don't pretend to understand the exact process of previous deflationary problems, let alone the other factors that were present. However, I do understand the argument: "Why would I spend something that's worth more tomorrow." Isn't unwillingness to spend one of the reasons that we are still in this recession?
I'm not saying that deflation is bad. I think it could have a wonderful effect on the world. (Hey, bread is cheaper today!) I'm just not sure if it would be a good basis to run an economy on. I guess that this is just something that is extremely hard to predict. I was hoping someone wiser then me would have a solid argument on why deflation can be a good thing. When good arguments are absent, people are just going to trust what they know. What they know is that deflation hasn't had great effects on the global economy so far. I want to convince them that deflation can offer us some things that inflation can not.
I think you misunderstood my second question. I understand that the network is pretty solid against bandwidth attacks. I'm talking about forks. Or, creating a LOT of double-spending transactions which will result in a lot of branches which could perhaps crash a lot of the mining nodes, thus weakening the network and making the 51% attack a lot easier. 
Or perhaps, just send out a lot (and I mean a lot) of invalid transactions. (Being double-spending transactions, or other invalid transactions.) 
This might overload the network, while it's doing busy-work. (Hashing the invalid transactions.) You could then take your pool of 10% of the network, ignore all the invalid transactions and create a long part of the blockchain. Once all the other nodes are finished invalidating your first transactions, they would accept your chain as the valid chain, since it's longer.
However. This might be getting a little bit to technical. Maybe I just have to start reading the source and do some math.
edit: I just realized that even if this is possible, that the attacker wouldn't gain much since he can't fake the transaction blocks himself.

This is actually a really nice way of looking at the problem. Thanks for that!

Yes, but Bitcoin is in it for the long run, isn't it? I'm pretty sure that if we'd expect it to fail, this subreddit wouldn't have had more than 100k readers. ;)
I wouldn't be suprised if bitcoins would become 'the gold' of the internet age, while some altcoins which ARE inflationary would become the mainstream currency.
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:44:06
You are right, I implied that bitcoins would be the main currency. But why wouldn't they, if they only rise in value?
My second post indeed shows some misunderstanding of how the protocol works. That's why I asked the question. :) I've already read quite a lot about the protocol and plan to read more. I was just hopeing that someone could answer this one for me.
I did see the BIP about how the fee system is in need of a big overhaul. I guess we'll just have to wait and see how that works out.
@_date: 2014-02-09 12:41:59
That's not [necessarily]( true.
@_date: 2014-02-04 20:26:12
Thanks for your response. Interesting reads about the fees.
About the fees. I like your attempt at predicting the future of fees, however, the fees are not going to stay as they are. See [this]( and [this]( gist by Gavin Andresen. I think this might introduce competition into the fees, which would probably result to them becoming lower, once more nodes and consumers start using the network.
I didn't know about the block limit, I'm going to have to read more before I fully understand how that problem works.
@_date: 2014-02-04 18:06:37
For the sake of the argument I am indeed assuming that Bitcoin would become the major, if not only, currency. The baseline of value, if you will.
@_date: 2014-02-08 14:05:05
Wow, already? It scares me a bit that they're doing this already. "the first of many of our own mega data centers". I hope other companies will follow suit, or KnC will end up with a lot of mining power.
@_date: 2014-02-09 13:08:01
This is not true. While ECDSA has bigger risk of being broken than SHA, you cannot calculate a private key from a bitcoin address. You would be able to calculate a private key from a public key, but your public key will only become truely public once you send something out of an address. If ECDSA would be broken, we could stop reusing addresses. Sending the change to another address (as was the intention of Satoshi.) Trading in this way would give the developers some time to convert the wallets to a newer encryption algorithm.
Besides that, we would probably know that ECDSA will be comprimised long before it actually becomes comprimised.
@_date: 2014-09-27 12:44:55
But what the hell is this? The site doesn't really explain what it does.
You have to deposit bitcoin, then you can play and then you can withdraw bitcoin? No thanks, I'd rather just log inito the game and play it without paying.
Not trying to be a dick and perhaps I'm just missing something, but I don't understand what this should do.
@_date: 2014-02-04 07:55:50
Ok, I have some questions. I do own some bitcoins and believe in the sytem, but there are a few things I can't wrap my head around.
- A lot of people worry about the deflationary system of bitcoins. How is this not a problem?
- Is it possible to forkbomb the blockchain? What if someone would post a LOT of double spending transactions. Could the network branch so much that the nodes run out of memory?
- Why are the fees not going to explode once the last bitcoins have been mined? It seems to me that the fees at the current price won't be enough to saturize the mining market. I haven't done maths though.
@_date: 2014-02-04 18:38:29
Thanks for this explanation.
@_date: 2014-02-04 20:34:33
Thanks. Great point on the necessity of loans. I don't think the argument will always hold up though. It might become less attractive to put down a loan for a house, a car or a tv, which I greatly support.
However. What will happen to startups? A lot of startups need an investment before they can start. I think that it will be a lot harder to get someone to invest in your idea. I'm not sure wheter this is postive or not.
Besides that, A lot of countries still have pretty bad health care. What if you need a loan for an expensive operation?
There are some loans that have a function different than consumerism. Would a global adoption of bitcoin harm those kind of loans?
@_date: 2015-05-31 18:32:44
So I have missed a lot. Thanks for the info. I'll definitely be looking into this.
@_date: 2015-05-28 06:54:48
This is very true.
@_date: 2015-05-27 17:08:46


This seems pretty relevant to the campaign.
It might be possible on one server, but I doubt it. A dedicated server that could run this would probably be a lot more expensive than an hour of CPU cycles on their own cloud.
However, this is all guesswork. I have no idea how their software works. I do think that the campaign is a good idea and I'm all for more players in the business of cloud computing.
Besides that. Like I said before: They're obviously just doing it to promote their cloud. I think they chose a great way to do that.
@_date: 2015-05-31 13:04:09
Besides that we can assume that the global internet connections will only get faster. If we set an arbitrary number as the blocksize limit, we'll just have to hard fork again in a few years. Don't we?
@_date: 2015-05-27 16:07:23
That depends on how accurate the application is. Let's assume that you stop receiving money within 5 seconds after your phone comes below a certain point.
Accoring to wikipedia (yes, I'm quoting wikipedia) there were 8000 attendees at Campus Party São Paulo in 2014. Let's assume that's a correct number for 2015.
If half of them had the IBM app installed, that's still 4000 people.
If, during the event, these 4000 phones would broadcast their accelerometer and location data every 5 seconds, you would need a server that can handle receiving approximately 800 uncachable requests per second. For these 800 requests you need to check if the location data is within a certain polygon. If 200 requests are left, you will need to use the values from the accelerometer from the past 5 seconds to calculate how far these 200 phones have moved from their starting points. This will leave you with a subset of users of which you'll need a bitcoin address. Then you might even need to send a response to the phone, so that it triggers the coin animation and you need to do this before the next request from the phone comes in.
Then you need to create the transactions, sign them and send them.
Maybe they were even sending them over a secure connection. That would need some more CPU for your 4000 SSL connections.
All in all, I think you'll need quite a bit of computing power to get this working. You could probably do this on one of the other big cloud providers, or even on your blade servers. But that wouldn't really draw attention to the fact that IBM now has a cloud platform as well.

I'm getting the impression that one gavinandresen should be worth 11 bits. ;)
@_date: 2015-05-31 15:25:30
Hmm, that sounds pretty good.
But are side chains still a thing? I know there was a big hype about it a few months ago, but has any progress been made?
And IIRC, sidechains need a hard fork as well, don't they?
I must admit I haven't been following bitcoin as closely as I would've wanted the past few months, so I'm not entirely sure about all the arguments in the big blocksize debate.
@_date: 2015-05-27 12:13:58
Beside that, they would pobably need to process the data from the cellphones in order to check if their owners were in the right spot, with their phones above their heads.
@_date: 2015-04-05 14:55:43
