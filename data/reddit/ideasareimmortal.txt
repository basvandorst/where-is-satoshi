Debt based economy is capitalism.
Central banks aren't socialist.

Capitalism doesnt work for a couple of reasons.
1) Private banks can just print money out of nothing and charge interest while still printing regardless and causing mass devaluation of labor.
2) Currency is infinite, in contrast with resources, which are limited.

How are you gonna fulfill your bullshit utopia if most people dont have internet?
@_date: 2019-03-13 02:22:39
Capitalism isnt those things but it is inherently bonded to them. Without them, it cannot exist in modern society. 
"Someone lording over it" isnt what socialism is. In the past socialism has required autocracy to be executed because of outside interference. This does not mean autocracy is inherent in socialism just as oligarchy isnt necessarily inherent to capitalism.
