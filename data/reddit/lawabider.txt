Don't get excited; bitcoin is collapsing. The number of transactions is healthy but with the price declining like this, the miners will not be happy to keep maintaining the network. It could be quite a dramatic collapse. And I am talking about of the network, not the price.

I think that this is a terrible thing to say. There is no real demand for bitcoin, just speculation. Gold has real demand. Bitcoin could go to zero in a day or two and nobody should be surprised. It should be used for making payments, holding bitcoin for as little time as possible to minimize the risk, in my opinion.

Gold is valuable because it is in demand for jewelry. You said yourself that there are huge amounts lying around in vaults. One could say it's not very scarce then.

I believe that bitcoin lending will create demand and make the system viable. Until then I am open minded about whether bitcoin will turn out to be a fad or not. Either way, it is extremely clever and has some amazing features and possibilities (for example multiple signatures for transactions).


@_date: 2014-10-02 23:26:06
I would say the most likely failure point would be the electrical contacts. I had a USB3 stick fail for this reason. Keeping it simple and using an SD card is probably a good idea.

Sorry, but you are going to loose your money. There is no real source of demand underpinning bitcoin, and there are no assets backing it either. You would do much better to hold on to your money and patiently wait for something similar but viable.

In an arbitrage situation it might become cheaper to mine dogecoin and sell for bitcoin than to mine bitcoin directly. That has been the situation, and it drives the doge/btc exchange rate down when people do this. All the scrypt coins are on the same trend. An interesting question is to what will the asic-resistant coins like vertcoin do.

Thing is, where is the non-speculative demand for bitcoin going to come from? People obviously will not have to aquire bitcoin to pay tax. 
I wonder if there will only be real demand for bitcoin when bitcoin lending gets going, as people need bitcoin to make repayments. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 00:55:36
There is no demand for bitcoin because governments do not demand it as tax. If you can convince a government to do this, then maybe bitcoin has a chance.

I never said that people want to pay taxes; i said that people have to pay taxes. This creates demand for the national currency. Without real sources of demand it is just worthless paper. 
Speculation on Bitcoin or any other currency is based on expectation of future sources of demand. At the moment, i fear that bitcoin may be in an absolutely ludicrous "speculative bubble", having an unjustified price. I would be happy to be proven wrong (since I am mining and holding cryptocurrencies).

@_date: 2014-03-17 00:21:01
In my view they are just bitcoin proxies, where the exchange rate with bitcoin should be dictated purely by energy used per coin (or else there is an arbitrage opportunity like there is). Newer alcoins aren't any more bs than litecoin, as long as they are on an exchange.

Using the published numbers for the gridseed and an electricity price of USD .12 per kwH, I get **$14.4 per transaction electricity cost**. So i take it that the reward needs to be greater than that figure.
