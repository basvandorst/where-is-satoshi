They use Coinbase, which I prefer anyway, although it's mostly useful to Americans.

Is there any attempt to create a digital currency similar to Bitcoin, but that *always* has a small steady fixed inflation, and the production is infinite? So basically like many other central bank currencies, but digital ones (and of course decentralized)?

You can convert USD dollars from your US bank account to Bitcoin with [Coinbase]( In Europe (and I think from other places, too) you can use [Bitcoin-central] (

But how would they actually do that? I think it would be more effective to actually coerce banks and whatnot into stopping giving them money, like they did with Wikileaks.

Good points, but I think it's great to have competition with virtual currencies. When you create something totally new - most people will think you're insane - like most people think about Bitcoin now. But when competition starts to show up, they start to reconsider their position, and take all of them more seriously. So this is good for the Bitcoin world.

Don't be silly! Phones will never fly through the air. FAA says so.

There are already such universities or educational tools online. You just need to get them to accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2012-12-23 20:32:07
Yeah, that's exactly what I thought when I saw this. This should only make the case for Bitcoin stronger, and accelerate its adoption down the line when people won't be able to trust dollars because they devaluate way too quickly, and their salaries are falling more and more behind compared to the products' price tags.

It begins.

Mounted encrypted drives aren't secure. They need to be unmounted. I assume the same is true for files, too. They shouldn't be in memory, because they aren't encrypted then.

There should be no transaction fee when going *into* Bitcoin, only when getting out. That would it would get people to actually use Bitcoin as a currency.

I don't know why he didn't accept Bitcoin from the beginning. It seemed like an obvious move to at least offer it as an option.
@_date: 2013-02-18 02:30:32
This makes me think that this is one of the ways they will "criminalize" Bitcoin though. They'll pass some laws like these, that they know it can't be enforced for Bitcoin, and then they'll demonize Bitcoin, and try to stop all shops in those specific countries from using it, and accuse them of breaking those laws, or "laundering" or whatever.
@_date: 2013-02-15 00:35:29
Now let's get the  (or whatever its rank) site to accept Bitcoins, too - Wikipedia!
Wikipedia covers the whole world, too, and I think Bitcoin would be a great match.
@_date: 2013-03-15 11:56:07
IndieGoGo should definitely accept it, too, especially if they want a leg up on Kickstarter.
@_date: 2013-04-02 15:56:43
I'd rather a huge company like WU didn't get monopoly on Bitcoin trading. Let them *compete* with mtgox. We'll all be better off for it.
Even if they don't buy them I can already see them charge like a 5% fee for Bitcoin trading. Owning mtgox would only make it worse.

Then they'd have an even bigger reason to revolt, and the dictator has less reason to try it. Sounds good to me.

What businesses do you know that are cash flow positive in less than 6 months? 
They've only been in business for a few months. Give them time.
@_date: 2013-02-06 18:35:48
why even focus on this kind of articles? It only helps speculators and people who want to hoard Bitcoin, not *use* it.
We need to be focusing more on the **Bitcoin economy** and on how many new companies are adopting it. If anything high variability of Bitcoin is a BAD thing for companies.
Bitcoin will not survive because of speculators. In fact they are the ones that did the most damage to it last year.

Well technically there *was* a bubble. Just because an economy recovers to where it was a few years later after the bubble, doesn't mean you didn't go through one a few years before.
If the housing and mortgage market recovers to where it was by 2015, should we pretend there never was a housing bubble in US?

CyanogenMod and Moxie are working on a solution that should work even with Whatsapp, I think, and all other text apps:
Donate to them.
@_date: 2013-01-07 19:53:39
The solution for payment gateways like banks and Paypal being able to stop the sales of books, betting, certain donations and whatnot "because they think so". 
It's one thing for the laws to demand them to do this, and it's quite another when they start doing it out of the goodness of their own hearts.

I use Namecheap. They're great. Wouldn't touch Godaddy with a 10 foot poll anyway. Namecheap for domains and Hostgator for hosting are great alternatives.
@_date: 2013-02-12 19:47:33
Why not .eu if it's an .eu store anyway. Do you really want to risk US taking down your domain 3-5 years down the road if they eventually decide to ban Bitcoin businesses or something? Because US *can* take down .net domains at will right now, along with .com and .org, thanks to the Pro IP Act passed 2008, and they are regularly using it right now against piracy sites and fake-bag types of sites. They didn't need SOPA for these domains, only for all the other ones.

Let's do it.

What are the advantages of this over Retroshare, which I believe has a similar "email" P2P system? And why is it not using OTR? Can it use it?
@_date: 2013-01-11 16:26:56
Any digital version around?

How soon will Coinbase work with EU banks and IBAN numbers? Please make it happen this year!
@_date: 2013-01-06 16:03:43
Obama is NOT going to sign that. He's very much a believer of centralizing the economy and manipulating it with the Fed. Bitcoin would pretty much ruin that idea for him. Maybe if Rand Paul or Ron Wyden become president after him...
Unless what the prediction means is that Bitcoin will become commonly used with or without the government's consent. Then yeah I can see that happen.
@_date: 2013-03-16 18:05:44
When is Bitcoin-Central going to accept IBAN accounts already?
@_date: 2013-01-25 19:47:14
 should make transfers from IBAN accounts from any EU bank to their accounts available in a few months. Then you can use your currency or euro to buy Bitcoins from them.
