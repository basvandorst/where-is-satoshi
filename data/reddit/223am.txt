is it possible to switch your wallet between the 2? so for example say i create a wallet with the standalone, and then at a later date want to move that wallet to the portable version, is that possible?
also, in some ways isnt keeping your wallet on a separate usb (portable version) not connected to the internet, safer than keeping it on a PC connected to the internet (standalone version) ?

thanks, but was wondering if there is a single app that combines both stocks and cryptos into 1 portfolio so you can see it all on 1 page.
i read that stockfolio does this, but seems this app is only for iphone. looking for android alternative

thanks for your help. one last question. if someone has my seed words, does that mean that they can access my coins? or do they also need my password that i created when making the wallet?

ok so just to clarify 100%. let's say 1 bitcoin is selling for exactly $2000 on bitstamp. i buy a laptop on dell selling for exactly $2000. i choose to pay in bitcoin. will i be charged exactly 1 bitcoin for this? 
so neither dell nor the middleman are taking a cut? they are giving you exactly fair market price on the currency conversion?

Care to site some sources that say you can keep money accidentally deposited into your bank account?

Thanks will do

You're still speculating when you don't actually know if it's legal to keep BTC accidentally sent to you. You made a post like you knew what the law was

Care to site a source that says you are allowed to keep money accidentally sent to you?
edit: I feel like there is a fair amount of shadenfraude going on in this thread. Like people are happy the guy lost his money and are shaming him for it? And yet nobody can provide a source, just downvote those that question their legal knowledge :D
