If I remember correctly, this was actually James McCarthy, the man behind the now closed Global Bitcoin Stock Exchange (glbse, closed fall 2012. Along with the Pirate saga this was a big issue in Bitcoinland at the time). I think he lived in China for at while. 
Nefario was his username on Bitcointalk and on Reddit.

I have no idea really. Probably because this newspaper article was based on another newspaper article which cited a third newspaper article which was based on a journalist's vague recollection of having read something on an obscure internet forum.

You're probably thinking of Bitcoin-24. Run by a young, inexperienced guy. He had bank accounts both in Germany and in Poland. Both were frozen, but the German one was reopened and some of the funds (72%) returned to customers who claimed them. The rest was in the Polish account, which is still frozen. So people are still waiting for their money returned.
In the meantime, seems like Bitcoin-24 v2 has opened, and former customers who are waiting for the rest of their funds from the original exchange are getting angry. Doesn't look like the revival of Bitcoin-24 has been a success yet, as volume is really, really low.

I don't see anyone calling for the government to refuse him to have this rule. What I see is people saying it's not a smart way to reduce the volatility risk.

Sorry about the horrible formatting and the Google Translate. I made this post with my phone, so please keep that in mind. (I don't have access to a computer for weeks.). 
It's not my find, originally found by user Herodes on Bitcointalk. I posted it here as I haven't seen many finance ministers commenting on Bitcoin so I thought it could be interesting for others as well.

Of course, but how would you know that the crash would happen at  260, and how could you be sure that you would be able to time your buys/sells correctly during this crazy time, and with a 10-20 minute lags on top of this?

Bitcoin-Central were also going to offer this, through a partnership with a bank. After the recent hack though I'm not so confident this will materialize either.

As a customer with funds tied up with bitcoin24, I haven't started to view regulatory compliance a part of an exchange's security practice. Whether your money is stolen by a hacker of seized by the government, the end result is often same.

I agree with you, but it would also be important to include printer drivers with the distro. I created a Ubuntu Live USB once, but couldn't get it to work with my Canon printer. Tried with turboprint but got stuck with missing dependencies. Ended up buying a used win7 (fresh install) laptop. Worked like a charm. This was with Armory btw.

It is speculated that (part of it at least) it could be people at Mt.Gox buying bitcoins to withdraw, considering the recent Dwolla issue.
But there is also a constant stream of good news coming out these days, increasing confidence. Maybe not game-changing news, but good news nonetheless, so that might also be the reason.
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:47:33
I think some are a bit confused by people claiming that Bitcoin now "has gone mainstream", therefore they expected much higher numbers. But BitPay's numbers prove that Bitcoin is far away from being mainstream, but at the same time they show that usage has grown a lot in the last year. 
@_date: 2013-03-07 14:00:14
Yes it is supply and demand, but it's a market where rising demand and prices (fees) do not increase supply. This puts a limit on how many "Bitcoiners" there is room for in the system.
If Bitcoin were to really take off, you would have a situation where demand for transactions space outstrips supply by 10x, 100x or maybe even a 1000x. This means that there will not be room for 90%,99% or 99,9% of all transactions, regardless of how much the sender is willing to pay.
Clearly, if this is not solved in some way, this will prevent Bitcoin from ever getting close to mainstream.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:39:09
If the price were to stabilize around 100-150 and stay there for a while that would actually be great news. It's still a major gain so far this year.

@_date: 2013-04-14 17:44:24
To me, the biggest problem is not that my withdrawal is delayed, the problem is the uncertainty whether I will get my money back. Yes, the funds might be safe, but who knows how and when they will be accessible to Simon. If the bank is concerned about AML, why would they suddenly release the funds for Simon to pay out after all?
If this really is because of fraud/AML, my guess is that everyone at least will have to verify themselves before the money can be paid out (which I don't really mind, as long as a normal scan of documents is sufficient).

Virtual currencies have the most potential for adoption in markets where trust of banks and the ordinary payment system is low, where electronic payment systems are poorly developed or where there are currency restrictions. 
In Norway digital payment is ubiquitous, and effective, cheap and safe electronic payment is readily available both for for consumers and merchants. 
98.7 percent of 2 bn payments in 2011 were electronic. 
With such a well-functioning ordinary payment system, taking into account also the value fluctuations of virtual currencies, it is not very probable that Bitcoins will be widely used in Norway.
Bitcoin is unregulated and can be attractive to criminals. 
Bitcoin is not covered by the Norwegian regulations on payments services and e-money. Trade with Bitcoins is not covered by EEC payments directives and the e-money directive.Trade with Bitcoins basically is not reportable under AML regulations. 
I will monitor the development and assess the need for regulations. We are participating in discussions on a European level regarding the need for regulation of virtual currencies. In my view a common international approach is preferable.

Well, I think it was just one of the devs that talked about social contract and filtering, not all of them. I may remember incorrectly, but I think Andresen and Garzik have a different take on this.
However, you are right that this is a critical issue for Bitcoin and will have to be delar with one way or another if Bitcoin is to continue gaining traction.

The problem is, people are getting worried that this turns out to be a scam where he constantly comes up with problems that postpones payouts. Releasing the btc would go a long way to alleviate these concerns. That's why this is so important. (I didn't have any btc there, but a pending eur withdrawal, so I wouldn't get anything except a bit more peace of mind if he were to release the btc).

This is some very sound advice. I especially liked the comparison to a car crash, it is spot on for how this will play out for most people.

I was actually going to cash out a little last evening, but due to renovation there is no electricity in my apartment. So I wasn't able to as I didn't have access to my coins. Just as well, I would never have sold into yesterday's market, it was crazy town. 
Anyway, I'm in it for the long haul so I'm not really that bothered. Just hope it manages to stabilize around 60-80 during the next weeks.

Interesting article, but it fails to mention that in addition to mining bonds, a large part of GLBSE's business was pass-throughs to pirate's scheme (at least from April/May 2012 and onwards.). 
A third category was investment funds that invested in mining bonds, pirate pass throughs (as well as other investment funds). 
 Apart from these three categories, there really wasn't too much else to invest in on the exchange.

This has become a rather hot discussion over at Bitcointalk. If the max block size isn't increased, transactions could become more expensive or slower as you say. If it is increased, the block chain might become to large for regular users to keep on their local machine. 
One could say Bitcoin could become a victim of its own success, but I feel confident this will be solved in a reasonable manner.

Yes, maybe I exaggerated, but my point was that one should not underestimate the importance of compliance when dealing with fiat. There are more than enough examples of exchanges that run into trouble because they don't take this seriously enough.

"Samples of these purchases [from Silk Road] have been laboratory-tested and have typically shown high purity levels of the drug the item was advertised to be on Silk Road."

I think the bank accounts (or maybe one of them, Bitcoin-24 used two) can be frozen for up to 3 months (from April), after which they will be unfrozen unless the authorities press charges or something (though I may be wrong).
Simon (the owner) has returned at least some of the bitcoins people had on Bitcoin-24, so I cautiously optimistic that fiat will be returned. 
You can also check this forum for more details:

I can really recommend Armory. It may not be as easy as Instawallet (was), but I think it is very intuitive and using it shouldn't pose any trouble. 
If you use Armory and have more than a small amount of coins you should use it to create an offline wallet. You can set up it up either with an old laptop 256 mb ram or something)  or on a Linux Live USB. 
As mentioned below you can also print out a paper wallet, so if your computer explodes you can input the codes from the paper wallet into a new computer and your old wallet will magically appear as if nothing happened.
