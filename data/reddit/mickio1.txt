Oh really? I tought the CPU mining was outdated an a tutorial told me starting with a graphics card was better...i dont know what to think anymore!

So basicly i missed an oportunity to mine the equivalent of a money MMO? For fuck sake i missed the sweetest gig of my time! Now only the rich kids with ultra high end servers and big jobs get to mine virtual money! Of course these coins unlike the normal economy isnt given to other internet workers because there are none others! Just the miner and his pool...
Goodbye slush's pool and stuff...reality sucks dosent it? If i could sumarize life it would be a constant stream of slaps in the face where you just have to stand back up and get slapped down again...

I just want to mine some virtual coinc to buy games and get money doing nothing on my compy! Not run a freakin server in the stocks market! Also, does mining with a GPU slow my compy down and makes my bills higher??

If GPU is better than CPU...what is viable? Also, does it maked my internet or electricity bill higher?
