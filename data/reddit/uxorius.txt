Why do you keep saying my bank of america? It's so oddly worded.. first of all its not your bank, second who cares if its bank of america, citibank, or any other bank? What is going through your mind that you find it paramount to specify that bank in every comment?

Please enlighten me on how it is wrong to get rich quick but it's ok to get rich "not quick" or over the years. You will eventually want to sell that bitcoin, and when you do hundreds of thousands will also want to sell it. The only difference between selling now and getting a profit and selling later and getting a profit is that you're hoping that you'll get "richer" in the long run. I have bad news for you though, you probably won't due to the extremely high fees a few years from now and the limit on transactions in relation to the demand.

Unless you're incredibly rich, a person can be naive and imagine that his small collaboration to buying bitcoin (that will eventually give him/her a profit) will actually improve society in some way. Some people call them white Knights shielding their greedy desires of getting more money behind an idea that everyone will benefit from not having a centralized currency. And that is OK, that is their world, nothing is going to change the fact that bitcoin increases or decreases in price over the long run. But most people that buy bitcoin or have bought bitcoin in the past few weeks, so much so that the price has skyrocketed, don't care about the idealistic purpose of cryptocurrency(nor do I tbh). You can see the general sentiment in posts in this su reddit, either showing off their gains or telling a story of success. Be them true or not (most are just upvote seekers Imo), most people are here to cash BTC into fiat, and when they day "hold" they generally mean hold box long enough so that they can cash out 100k or a million per bitcoin even though it would be impossible due to limitations in the system ( taxes,exchanges,limits,downtime,transaction fees,etc etc) 
I can assure you only a very small number of people that have invested in bitcoin believe that it will eventually replace fiat, and that is why I believe  it's doomed long term.

If you eliminate the pizza guy, the weed guy and the fake house online, bitcoin would still have the same price and volatility as it does now. What are you on about? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:04:47
You're talking about BTC in the present moment. Once people begin spending it, the price would have stabilized counter arguing your position.
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:07:39
Except before, there was a general consensus that BTC would eventually be used. Now, the general consensus is that BTC is a investment asset with no other purpose. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 01:45:30
can you elaborate some more on that? Is it because mining would be meaningless?
@_date: 2017-02-21 01:46:09
Has there ever been any record of someone doing something similar to that?

There is some crowdfunded research, but it is not the norm. Usually research laboratories compete with other teams to get a grant for a specific idea.

At the end of the day, your opnion (r/Bitcoin) will be meaningless, and it will only matter where the money is.

It will happen eventually. I'm pretty sure the probability of this happening is not 0%, so all those people saying never are delusional. There is at least, a slight probability that the big fork goes through and this will mean a big change in paradigm for many hodlers. It is a matter of when and we should be prepared. Having an estimation of when this will happen will help a lot of people.

@_date: 2017-11-23 14:52:23
a) Why would you take a picture of a facebook live stream? b) 100% digital currency goodness? c) No banks no mortgages, but a "butt load of paperwork" probably more than when buying a house with cash. 
I'll make sure to check the public records under your name (because your name has been published before) in the "near future" to see if you really bought a house with bitcoin.

the fact that it takes a collective effort for bitcoin to succeed makes it an almost impossible task
@_date: 2017-04-05 18:29:26
Your response lacks objectiveness and is filled with subjective wishful thinking. The fact of the matter is that right now, miners have the power and despite your belief that BTC follows standard economic rules, the fact is that it doesn't.
@_date: 2017-04-05 16:41:26
Never going to happen. Why would they give up the power?

Summary of following replies:
1) Guy (with 20 dollars in BTC) saying he "hodled", and is thefore now superior. 
2) Guy saying he sold his (20 dollars in BTC) and is therefore inferior. 
3) Whiteknights pitying guy 2.
4) Story about how convincing or not convincing some family member to get bitcoin before/after the drop.
and 5) The classic condescending "it's Bitcoin, what do you expect" or "how long have you been here", when there's no way of predicting what Bitcoin will actually do. 
I hate this community.

As interesting and amazing as that would be, that is not my area. Another benefit of crowdfunding scientific research is that it's 100% unbiased as opposed to some research (not all) funded by pharmaceuticals, that sometimes have a very clear agenda.

No one knows, and those who say that they do are either giving you a biased opinion based on wishful thinking or are bots. 
Bitcoin could be 500 dollars or 10 000 dollars by the end of the year. Nobody knows.

I don't think it's wise to be spreading stories like yours online. Do not glorify bitcoin because you were able to buy it in 2014 when things in Venezuela were not nearly as bad. 
Bitcoin may be saving your family but it's too volatile for everyday use, and your post may make it seem like people in venezuela should buy into bitcoin. They shouldn't. Bitcoin fee's are high enough that they'd have to pay 3 times what they pay for bread over there or have their transaction lost in a limbo for 2 weeks. They should not invest in such a volatile market for daily necessities. If god forbid someone in Venezuela listens to you and invests more than they should right now and then the bubbles pops, they will be in a dire situation. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:57:03
Lol what did you expect?
@_date: 2017-05-13 21:54:40
You're right. There are 149 000 pending transactions as of this moment. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:22:47

@_date: 2017-05-17 01:54:47
The feeling is mutual. I used to be a very proactive bitcoin believer. I guess just as anything in life, you can't put all your eggs in a  basket even. 
The feeling right now with bitcoin is that its losing momemtum, and lacking any real world purpose. 
And mark my words, given the current problems, people will begin to flock to altcoins in an exponential rate.  Most holders will say fine leave, and that's exactly what's wrong with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-13 21:54:03
Please do explain further. I don't understand your comment. Why is it necessary for a supposedly decentralized currency, "to have a backlog of transactions awaiting confirmation"?
You're right in the sense that a large number of pending transactions could mean that bitcoin is getting a broader userbase. But if as you say, bitcoin wants to survive in the long term (with normal day to day transactions) How would that work with this current system given that its use would be exponentially higher in the future?

It doesn't make sense to use bitcoin right now. People saying that they should hold until it gets to 100 000. Why would I spend whatever 3 dollars is in bitcoin atm just so I can regret it in the future that I've spent over 1000 on an apple. 
It make no sense.

@_date: 2017-05-13 22:09:16
Why would they do that knowing that one of the reasons there's an increase in pending transactions is because people are ignorant of transaction fees!
@_date: 2017-05-28 04:49:26
This is you less than a day ago " Genuinely don't give a shit that the price has corrected/crashed/whatever you want to call it. It'll be back sooner or later. Bitcoin is long term. Don't weep." you're either a troll or I don't know.

@_date: 2017-05-13 22:05:11
I can't get myself to believe that. You may be right in the sense that a few people could be doing that.
How many of those 149 000 could that be though? And considering the price increase, I'm willing to bet its mainly normal people trying to get in the bitcoin rollercoaster for some quick money. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 13:28:05
sometimes the easiest way to get someone to get into bitcoin is just telling them to get it because itll be great in the future and explain why that's going to happen. 
Sometimes i feel like too many people go into way too much detail. It's sort of like the war between PC and Apple back in the 2000's. Bitcoin should get an apple approach, just tell them what it's for and why it's going to make their lifes simpler. 
You could also get some generous people to donate for a good cause (like mine, haha), thats a good way to get people into bitcoin.
