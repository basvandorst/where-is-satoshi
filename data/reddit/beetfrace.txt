This could be beginning of a 1-2 week correction. This is the most red we've seen since the first half of Sept

Hi, I have read your article in the past and enjoyed it.  I would be interested to hear your thoughts regarding the mass adoption of bitcoin (final stage of s-curve) in today's cryptoeconomic atmosphere, considering your article was written prior to the bitcoin fork, segwit, ICOs and the issues surrounding them, china, etc. What effects do these events have on mass adoption?  Thank you for sharing your ideas, very informative!

Ethereum isn't being used for what it was intended to be used for by 99% of folks.  look at companies like Akasha -- a platform that is built by ethereum.  When eth *is* used in the way its suppose to be used, transaction costs can be much more costly.  Ethereum is highly inflated and will continue to do so as long as ICO's continue to pop up.  ICOs are funded by ethereum -- when ICOs come out, ETH avaialability goes down, forcing the price up.  This won't last for long...

UASF (user activated softfork) where potentially blockchain splits into two, legacy bitcoin and bip148 or something like that.  could cause major turmoil and volatility in the crypto market

I like GDAX for tracking valules...also changelly is what I use too -- their fees for exchange seem low but idk compared to other services
