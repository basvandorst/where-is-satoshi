Actually, we have centuries of evidence to show that currency with controlled inflation is better than currency that deflates.

Buddy, we don't use gold as a currency anymore. Part of the reason is *because* its value increases, which creates an incentive to hold money as an investment. Holding money is bad for the economy because it is better off used in productive investments. If you gain from hanging onto your money, why would you risk it to build something or invent a new machine?
There is so much wrong with this article I don't even know where to start. This guy gets some seriously basic stuff completely wrong. How about here with the lede:


Increasing value of money is *by definition* deflation. How is Krugman crazy for following the definition of deflation? You could check out the wikipedia article on [deflation]( but you will probably conclude that whoever wrote it is also a complete lunatic for understanding rudimentary economics.

Are you saying that Krugman misleads when he says Bitcoin value has soared overall? A year ago [one bitcoin was worth about 0.06 USD]( at mtgox. Now bitcoins are worth 7 USD. That's a annual rate of return of over 11,000%. Clearly deflating -- there is no question whatsoever.
edit: I computed the annual inflation rate on currency that goes from $0.06 to $7 in a year. The price for an item worth 16.67 bitcoins last year would currently be 0.14 bitcoins if we go by the USD exchange rate from MtGox. The inflation rate you calculate from such a price swing is -99.1%. Considering the lowest possible inflation rate is -100%, that's pretty amazing. This is after 3 months of inflation.

There seems to be somewhat of a cycle with periods of rapid deflation followed by periods of slow inflation. Maybe they will more closely even out and become less pronounced as the bitcoin economy grows.
