Selling at peak and buying at dip actually stabilizes the price. If everyone did that we'd have a smooth curve (but that's impossible).

Yes exactly what your edit means. And regarding the hindsight perspective, it's needed to understand which way your trade actually landed on in the long term average trends. Everyone takes a risk when they buy and sell, but those who statistically beat the consensus do create that smoothing effect. 
Is it possible to know 100% which side you're on a priori? no, everything is probabilities. If you add that fact and emotional pressure from large swings, many traders tend to follow the trend rather than set it (which would be trading against the market), following the trend has the opposite effect: amplifying volatility. But going back to the original question, if you sell at exactly the peak or slightly before it, you are trend setting and therefore smoothing.

If a person sells at or near peak, their ask price point added to the market depresses the price, given that the price falls after the peak their ask position correctly signaled an overvalued price point. Conversely if you place a bid at the dips, you are adding buy pressure and therefore raising the price and again signaling that the asset is undervalued. 
Correct market movers stabilize the price, it is usually the momentum followers that overdrive price movements and cause big swings.

Maybe I'm just explaining it poorly. Every trade has a small [Market Impact]( if you aggregate these, the people who trade correctly early (as measured when you look back) in peaks and dips will have net aggregate effect of working counter to the magnitude of the peaks and dips because they sold when the market was still going up, and bought when the market was still going down. That's all it is, dampening of the spikes. 
Conversely traders who sell after the peaks and buy after the dips amplify the magnitude of the trade spikes as they sold when others were sellling and bought when others were buying. Increasing the volatility through larger spikes.
This is related to feedback in control theory via [Lead-Lag effects](

That doesn't matter, I'm merely stipulating the effect the trades have on the price. All I'm saying is that people who correctly predict peaks and dips and trade accordingly have a smoothing effect on price such that it tends towards its long-term trend and reduces volatility. If you're profiting from short-term trades, you are smoothing the price curve.

Basically if you are trading correctly and selling before a peak and buying before a full dip you are stabilizing the market, if you're trading after the peak and dip you're enhancing the market volatility. Being early is a signal bearer and dampening effect for the market, being late is following the momentum/panic and exasperbating the swings.

I'm jealous. Part of the original box?
