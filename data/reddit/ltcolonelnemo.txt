Well, in my opinion, cash *could* allow that if the powers that be added some paper thin tracking mechanisms to it.  He's not exactly a libertarian, or much of an independent thinker for that matter.

Bitcoin alert is better than the MT Gox Widget at the moment because you can manually update it.  For some reason, the MT Gox Widget only updates when it feels like it.

You may have a point, but in the final analysis, every organization has weak spots, but stuff like COINTELPRO goes right in and exacerbates them to the point that the organization self-destructs.

Are you suggesting that finance moguls don't care about preventing crime because they are in fact criminals, and therefore conspirators?
All I know is that a relative who works relatively high up in the finance industry keeps running his mouth about banning cash; I assume he's getting his Kool-Aid from somewhere.

Untaxable?  If you realize a gain through bitcoin, like any other asset, it is subject to income tax laws as enforced by regulatory authorities like the IRS.  So, if you run out and buy a Porsche with your bitcoin earnings, and the IRS audits you, you'll have to explain why you failed to report your earnings and pay them a cut.  Keep in mind, this is the agency that goes after CRIMINALS for failing to report earnings from CRIMINAL ENTERPRISES.  They don't care if your business is illegal, they still want their cut.

You joke, but many in the finance establishment would like to ban cash for that very reason, although it would hardly make a difference, since the criminals would just evolve another method of carrying out their transactions.

Holy schnikeys!  They're up to $14!

Bitcoin is property, and is therefore subject to the laws concerning theft.  Good luck on enforcement, though.

Uh, no.  Digitally laundering money is probably a bad idea, because all the grunt work the police have to do if they are trying to prove real-world money-laundering through shell-corporations, restaurants, casinos, and other tried and true methods, can now be farmed out to networked supercomputers.  The makers of bitcoin admit as much.  Its value derives from operating outside the fee-structure of formal banking system.

Just wondering if this is what the Establishment will try and do to torpedo bitcoin, as well as possible counters.
