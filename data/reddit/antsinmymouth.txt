Just a matter of time until that is solved.  In my opinion it is incredibly important to have options to limit risks.

It's just a thought exercise.  The point was more about massive, cheap parallelization.

Also, if it's that flawed, what do you think big banks and brokerages would do if they were involved?  Consider how they exploit high frequency trading to their advantage.

Well, yes, and no.  Simply printing more money does not *necessarily* equate to an increase in inflation.  There are other factors at play.

Literally true, but rather the amount of potential reward is usually related to the amount of risk.  More risk, more reward.  Less risk, less reward.

Now, wouldn't it be funny if mining actually involved cracking encryption, for the NSA?
Something similar to the old Chinese Radio theory:  If China wanted to crack codes, it could distribute a radio to all of it's citizens.  Every once in a while it might print a "winning ticket" with a code they must turn in to claim a prize.  However what was really happening is that each radio would receive a coded message, and would print the key if it could solve it.  Massive parallelization...
Unlikely to impossible given how bitcoin mining appears to work, at least to my knowledge.

It's such a barrier to entry for users.  Do I expect my 70+ year old parents to have a separate isolated PC for key generation?  Actually they do, but is that realistic for widespread adoption?  Ask them to squirrel away their bitcoin in a paper wallet?  Paper or hardware, they're both subject to loss or damage.  Sure, I could secure my paper wallet in a safety deposit box, but christ almighty what a hassle.
At least with a traditional bank account if I lose my account information I'm only temporarily denied access to my funds.  Someone else is the authoritative source that validates my identity has multiple ways to do so.

God these are all reasons why bitcoin isn't suited for daily use.  Go ahead, down vote me, I have it coming.  I'm losing faith here.

Your biggest problem is that it will not be easy for them to integrate Bitcoin into their current ERP solution.  Their entire accounting system is based on pound, and introducing Bitcoin would make reconciliation difficult.  Another challenge is that there is a fair chance that your school's dining is outsourced (for example, many universities in the States have outsourced to Sodexoh for food services).  Then of course is the security FUD surrounding Bitcoin.

I am not sure.  All I can say is that there are often disclaimers on uninsured deposits indicating that they are not FDIC insured.  FDIC does not, however, cover credit unions which are usually insured by another organization.
After further research, FDIC wouldn't have covered a bank in a similar situation as it does not cover theft / fraud, although a bank would typically have separate insurance covering theft.

Hmm.  How did I miss those?
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:19:24
That was very insightful.
@_date: 2014-03-07 16:58:58
I'd watch.
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:02:39
Either way, at least in the U.S. it would have been FDIC insured.

Not necessarily directly.  Let's say you borrow 10k from the bank to renovate your bathroom.  Just to simplify, let's say its all labor.  You pay your contractor, who then deposits the money in his account.  While that money is sitting in that fellow's account, the bank can then lend out 9k of that money to someone completely different.  Maybe someone buying a car.  They pay that to the dealer, dealer deposits the money.  The bank now has another 9k deposit, and then can turn around and lend out 90% of that to someone else.
The person borrowing isn't likely to simply redeposit it, but it's probably going to make its way back to the bank one way or another.

Then they would have used 'stop' or 'terminate.'
Pause means its a temporary stop, often with the connotation that it will be restarted if and when certain conditions are met.

Self-serving motives aside, it looks like a case of "You've ignored this vulnerability, and the only way to get you to fix it is to publicize it:"

My dad got caught on something like that.  He had a boatload of GE stock -- 30,000 shares I believe, and as he approached retirement, it peaked at around $60 a share.  He bailed at $40, losing over half a million.  If he would have rode it to rock bottom, that is to $10 a share, that would have been a 1.5 million loss....
