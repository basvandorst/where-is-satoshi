The fed is an apparatus of the corporations. They do their bidding and set monetary policy in their favor. The fed themselves aren't in control and running the show. The corporations run the fed.

Yeah it's the federal reserve keeping people poor. Definitely not the multi national corporations that spend billions on lobbying.

yes, the Fed is the strings, the Corporations are the ones holding the strings. The fed is just the instrument, not the source of the power itself.

That's not true at all. Even without the fed, the corporate class has control of congress, the judiciary and the white house. The fed is only one of their many organs.

But the fed isn't the ONLY way they control the economy. The fed only sets monetary policy. They don't "control the economy" single handedly. Congress sets regulatory policy, taxes, subsidies, etc. The judiciary enforces contracts, regulations, etc. The fed is one piece of the puzzle and some people get so caught up on it. Typically libertarian/Ron Paul types.

Its not "the state vs us" it's the haves vs the have nots. Its the corporations and their state apparatus vs everyone else. 
How do some people STILL not recognize the threat corporations pose? They have bought off the US government and governments around the world and their economic production is destroying the planet. Wake up people.
