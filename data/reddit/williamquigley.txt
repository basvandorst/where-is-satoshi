I am assuming you don't know brock pierce.  i have known him for many years.  He is super hard working, loyal and very bright.  He is also a massive risk taker.  And sometimes that bites you in the ass.  t is really easy to avoid being associated with a failure, or a company that has problems.  Just do nothing in your life.  Work for a big company like a drone and do nothing exceptional.   Anyone involved in a bitcoin investment fund - which brock is - and who has started multiple bitcoin companies - which brock has - will from time to time have to deal with some problem, especially regulatory problems.   If you are an entrepreneur, and you have no blemishes on your record, you are either incredibly lucky or a man who has taken no risks in life.  Those sorts of people have no impact in this world, and I certainly am not interested in wasting my time with them.  And I think you are referring to DEN, the company that brock was involved with in the late 1990's.  That company crashed and burned at the end of the dot com bubble.  It got sued by various investors who lost their money.  I have looked into the lawsuits associated with that company.  It all comes down to one low life who sued multiple people for sexual harassment.  The case against brock, which was ridiculous on its face, since the guy who was suing was a known con man (not to mention a foot taller than brock), was dismissed. Anyone who has been in hollywood gets associated with some scandal at some point.  Especially for young actors, which is what he was when the company he was working at failed (during the dot com bubble crash). Like I said earlier, I assume you don't know him, but he would be a very valuable and helpful person to collaborate with if you had the chance.
