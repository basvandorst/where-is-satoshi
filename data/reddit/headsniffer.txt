Why did it take twitter pointing it out for you to let us read this thread?  The thing you said about flat earthers, even if true, comes across as very arrogant.

What’s the best solution right now for regular payments?  E.g. not a small e-commerce payment or an institutional payment, but like sending $300 to a friend?

Engineering chops are great, but how do you feel about their product management chops?  It seems like lightning is pretty difficult to use even for people (like myself) who are fairly tech literate. I’m having trouble figuring out how we will get people to adopt something that’s so complicated compared to existing products. Complicated even compared to using a regular bitcoin wallet (which already seems to be daunting to many).
I’m hopeful for the future, but the complexity concerns me from a product management standpoint.

Without some sort of utility (in this case usage as a currency), the only reason to buy bitcoin is if you think you’re one of the early fools in the [greater fools theory](
Scarcity of an asset is only one factor of its value. If it has no utility, it’s only source of demand will be from speculation and eventually it will run out of “greater fools” to buy-in to the scheme.

That’s right, thanks

I think they got rid of RBF because it makes double spend easier

With the evolution of smart contracts, loans on blockchains are in the not-so distant-future.

Why do think Satoshi chose not to just say “e-cash” or something that means settlement layer?  Seems like unnecessarily confusing double-speak.

Could a lightning node decide to block my transaction?

Can it automatically figure out a new route?  I thought this was one of the challenges still being worked on.

With LN, dont you have to have an equal or greater amount of liquidity in order to accept a payment? Also don’t you have to have a “watchtower” to be always online or else risk losing your funds?
I don’t think anyone will want to use a system like that.

Holy shit this is a stupid thread.

So I like what you’re saying, but isn’t lightning using a non p-2-p routing system? I guess I thought that the p-2-p aspect was having the option of transacting on-chain.

I think it comes from economics theory, which holds that a currency has key properties such as transferability (can be easily transferred between owners) and divisibility (can be divided into smaller portions without losing value). Utility of a currency is dependent on these properties (also three others which I didn’t name).

Ok thanks. Do you have a source?
@_date: 2018-04-04 20:06:59
Wasn’t it forked by a developer? I’m confused about why ver’s name is always attached to it, other than him being a supporter.
