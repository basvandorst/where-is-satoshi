I think most of people in this sub doesn't have the experience of living in the totalitarian state. As a Chinese, the points the author elaborated in this article is so relevant to my daily experience, and it is exactly the reason why I am getting into cryptocurrency/blockchain regardless of the price. The Chinese government are on the pace of building the worst high-tech dystopia that human race has never seen before, a regime state that has the complete control of the information of all your daily activity: video surveillance everywhere, face-scan in every train station/airport, access to every payment with wechat/alipay, bugging all forms of communication. Venezuela is an failing and incapable authoritarian state, but CCP is highly efficient, well-organized and has all the resource and technology to implement such dystopia. It happens not in the future, not in the cyberpunk movie. It is happening RIGHT NOW.
For me, bitcoin is not an investment; It is a weapon to fight against this dystopia. It matters for freedom.
