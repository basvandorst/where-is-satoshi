Printing money to artificially prop up the stock market... What? You have no clue what you're talking about.

this is my view as crypto trades very technically. if this TL isnt retested and broken, theres a high probability that we see a lot of red in the near future.  [
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:56:12
out of the probably millions of people randomly predicting arbitrary prices bitcoin will go to by a specific time,  the chances of one of them being right is pretty high. also, the more their predictions seem to be right, the lower the probability will be of them being right the next time. theres nothing to see here.

And now it's down. 14 was the top for this run.
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:30:27
wait what
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:59:42
if i remember correctly, there was someone in the last bull run who was right a couple of times on the way up, but their subsequent predictions kept going up well into the 100ks. this is lucky guessing. no one can predict long term prices like this, and the fact that the predictions are over the span of a month, thats a huge margin for error. thats like me saying that bitcoin will be 50k next year. it could touch or go past 50k in an instant in any of those 365 days. thats not very impressive to me.

Lol he's afraid of it? Come on now. I don't like trump, but this is just him tweeting his opinion. He's not afraid of crypto, nor should anyone be. What the fuck is this sub anymore?
@_date: 2019-07-15 03:05:54
That's from 2012 until now. It's down because it broke below, came to retest and rejected twice. Go to your own chart and draw the same line. Crypto trades very mechanically

I know. I should have. Like I said, this was at an ATH, and I wasn’t confident enough to buy there. My issue is that I did the same thing with $30 and it went through the next day. And in the scope of things $300 is not an exorbitant amount by any means    
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:09:53
Right, in hindsight I should have. But it was an ATH and I didn’t *want* to be locked in, Incase it went lower 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:00:32
I deposited it to the wallet so I could transfer it over to GDAX to avoid the fees. I’m sure there was a quicker and easier way to do this but I’m new to GDAX but it’s already saved me i fees 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:08:02
In an email from Coinbase “within 2-4 business days,  these funds should be available in your GDAX balance”
Maybe the key word is “should”

I put in at an ATH so I didn’t buy right away just for that reason. Boy was I wrong.

Hah you’re delusional if you don’t think the Deutsche Bank won’t get bailed out. Meanwhile you’re storing your money in a speculative asset that moves 10% +\- in a day. Bitcoin is a trading vehicle. Nothing more.
@_date: 2019-08-22 05:48:29
Doesn’t matter. Trading is very visual. People WILL buy/sell off of those lines.
@_date: 2019-08-29 07:35:41
Have you asked yourself if this was just short covering and a relief rally? What if the real move down is just now starting and you neglected to manage risk? You can always buy more if it goes up, but you’ll never be able to sell higher if it doesn’t

Go look at the chart of the S&amp;P. The bear market was done exactly then. Jan 2009 was the bottom. Think before you speak

“Markets tend to repeat themselves. But they don’t *have* to.”
Just remember that. It’s borderline delusional to base your patterns off only 10 years of data.
@_date: 2019-08-28 01:05:14
And how many people made predictions? Yea, so the odds of ONE person guessing three price levels in a row isn’t that low

Yup. I think I big part is that he *looks* like a nice young innocent kid. I think that creates a cognitive dissonance for some, perhaps.

My GF works for an investment company. Her boss *finally* showed interest in BTC after telling her to stay away from it, but that he didn’t know much about it. Sent him some good podcasts to check out, and of course this happens TODAY.

on coinbase or GDAX? i was doing that until i realized that i racked up $30 in fees, so i switched to GDAX and the fees are almost nothing, and can be nothing, unless you know this already.

decrease in value is a loss. if the value goes down, that money is worth less, and is not able to be used to buy the same amount of goods/services.

Money is an irational concept? It's completely rational and thedeivingf force of the world. Money single handedly pushed art/music to be shared. Think about that. There would never have been any other reason to share it.
