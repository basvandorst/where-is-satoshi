I'm not in the iPhone case business...
I'm in the ~~EMPIRE BUSINESS~~ bitcoin business.
My point is that I personally love it but, you're right, there may be other great ones out there

no, it fixes the problem for now, and if prices change by an order of magnitude again, we fix the problem again. It's an easy switch and it makes everyday commerce a little more consumer-friendly because instead of seeing .0010 and .0205, people will see its 1 and 20.5

This video is the curriculum of a college macroeconomics 101 course, except completely over-dramatized and only one side of the argument. 
I laugh when it goes over basic concepts like multiplier effect but sets them to scary music, clearly targeting impressionable 15 year olds.  Don't discredit the entire notion of monetary policy without hearing all sides of the argument.  If every country does it, maybe there's actually a reason.

I've been watching my investments closely the past few days (including BTC) because I noticed this trend as well, glad you documented it
@_date: 2014-01-20 19:52:58
That's funny-- I was just looking for a web-based implementation of SHA-256 and then poof, you sent it.  I think I understand it but there's always insight to be gained by getting your hands dirty and using it.  
One thing though-- you are speaking about the last digit being 0, but in the case of the bitcoin proof of work, what matters is the first digit, right?  I would assume the code just uses a &lt;. (less than).

Gotcha, thanks, I guess my questions boil down to questions about peer-to-peer networks.  Do you how know the process of connecting to other nodes works?   How has Blockchain gained more connections than the average node?  Have all [these](  nodes voluntarily connected to Blockchain and if so is there any incentive?

yeah, most haters don't watch his show, and I think if they did, they would enjoy it (except maybe the monologue), and learn things even if they disagree with him . 
The thing is, his show is on HBO so not a lot of people are able to watch it (legally) so people just make assumptions
@_date: 2014-01-20 18:54:15
Thanks.  Since now we are seeing difficulties of ~2bn then is it safe to say under this difficulty the chance of guessing a correct hash on a particular guess is ~ 1 /8x10^18 ?     (2 bn* 4bn=8x10^18)
@_date: 2014-02-03 04:43:55
: "If he had Andreas on, it would be to try and make him (and those who are into Bitcoin) look like goofs."
This is false and goes against basic understanding of TV.  Talk shows always treat guests with respect because they want to attract the highest-caliber guests to improve ratings.  
It's true that Bill Maher shrugged off bitcoin at first, but that's the same reaction most people have because the concept is so foreign.  I could see him learning more about it and being an advocate just like he is for wikileaks.  I think Andreas would be perfect for the opening interview once he comes around.

I am a full fan/believer of bitcoin, but I 100% agree with you.  Outside the bubble people barely spend bitcoins, but I think it will change
@_date: 2014-01-20 20:37:56
Gotcha-- It's all starting to come together, but while we're at it...
1. When Sha-256 displays a hash in binary it would need to use 4x as many digits as when displayed in hex (right?)
2. So since this site is displaying in hex and gives 64 digits, bitcoin hashes would be displayed in binary and have length 256, yes?
3. Is this why the function is called "256", since that is the longest meaningful way to display the hash?

Read (and maybe re-read) [this]( if you haven't already
@_date: 2014-01-25 22:23:19
fair point... but the pro-bitcoin arguments really do win out if you understand its potential as a a payment system.  The arguments against (at least in the media) are usually made by people who don't understand the protocol.  
I've also seen anti-btc arguments rooted in jealousy of early adopters, and others rooted in a lack of understanding of fractions/decimals

If bitcoin ends up being a bubble that fails dramatically I can forsee a lot of articles using this photo (ain't gonna happen though)

Bill Maher is on his game... there's no show that I've seen that has better political debates with best thinkers from all sides.  I'm not surprised that extreme libertarians on reddit will shun him, but it's undeniable that he supports his arguments with facts.
As somebody mentioned, he takes the libertarian view on Bloomberg's soda ban, and also on 'drug war', but he is also strongly pro-gun control and pro-animal rights, two issues where I happen to agree with him that the free market won't accomplish anything and govt is needed.
Also keep in mind, his is one of the only shows that has been able to score a recent interview with Julian Assange, and Maher is a clear supporter of Assange and his mission.
@_date: 2014-01-30 02:16:34
I think that's true for now but will change as more complex financial instruments develop (or become popular) for bitcoin

The personalities and attitudes of the people at the forefront of bitcoin are important.  I've listened to these two, and they are not particularly well-spoken or likable, and I've never heard them say anything original about bitcoin.  Sure, they spoke at the hearings but it would be much better to have somebody like Andreas whose arguments are much more humanitarian to be the public image for bitcoin.  If these two went away, or at the very least didn't stamp their name all over everything like Trump, that would help the cause.
@_date: 2014-01-20 20:17:41
One thing I want to clarify--
A specific cryptographic hash function doesn't use one specific base (hex, binary, etc.) for digits?  Is it the case that you can implement different bases on the same function (since you say Bitcoin uses binary but this web app uses hex)?
@_date: 2014-01-26 21:52:40
It's not stupid if you've ever actually shopped with bitcoin

There is value-- similar to a stock splitting, it let's new people in the market.  The difference is, in the case of Bitcoin those people COULD enter the market now, but a surprisingly high portion don't know bitcoins are divisible (source: talking to people).   
@_date: 2014-01-26 18:25:44
I think this is a good idea.  I would say we wouldn't need to do it if the public would just understand/learn decimals but I don't see that happening in my lifetime.
@_date: 2014-01-25 22:16:50
I agree, but I wasn't talking about price.  While price is related, I'm talking about bitcoin becoming mainstream 
@_date: 2014-01-25 19:12:34

I believe that the odds of a given key colliding are 2^256 as you say, but the odds of SOME collision occurring would obviously be much higher (but still mind-bogglingly low), as people have stated above
@_date: 2014-01-25 18:44:33
yep, that's another big one
@_date: 2014-01-21 22:39:51
The way I see the logic is:
* Bitcoin as a payment system has real advantages 
* -&gt; Bitcoin as a payment system will become mainstream
* -&gt; When it becomes mainstream the price will either stabilize or not
* -&gt; If it does, people will eventually feel safe keeping money in Bitcoin fulltime
* -&gt; If not, it will remain a great payment system
The largest caveat would be harsh government regulation but I don't see that as likely since it just gives other countries competitive advantages in commerce

Good questions-- I'm curious about these as well.  I'm no expert but I believe minor updates don't require a hard fork
@_date: 2014-01-29 00:17:12
1-- the word you want is demonization
2-- everyone knows the drug war is a crock, I'm not talking about that
3-- just because you are a libertarian doesn't mean everyone is.  Prohibition of some things is good for society.  Should we let anyone regardless of mental health buy guns?  More importantly, money laundering allows rogue states and terrorist groups to prosper.
@_date: 2014-02-05 20:04:03
Thanks-- I'm still shaky on some concepts though.  In your explanation is Blockchain just a typical node?  Aren't all nodes basically connected (universal ledger), or are there direct connections vs. indirect connections?

OK, thanks.  Getting closer to the whole picture but still not there.
So basically, the miner has the power to change two fields I described but changing the nonce in the coinbase transaction is really only done to change the merkle root.  Since computing the merkle root takes more computation than changing the nonce in the header, mining software changes it in the 'outer loop'.
So the four fields are:
1. Prev block hash
2. Nonce
3. Timestamp
4. Merkle root of transactions
I understand that 1. is fixed, 2 and 4 can be picked by the miner (either directly or indirectly), but now I am curious about 3.  Could a miner hypothetically put in any timestamp there? Does a timestamp that makes sense matter in the validation of a block?
And the main thing I don't get, is how exactly is the data from those 4 fields 'combined'?  For example, what precisely goes into SHA to get [this]( hash?
@_date: 2015-09-21 22:54:23
I guess I'm in the minority that thinks this is cool.  The price is too high for now, but it has potential.  As is, it probably provides $50 of value in hardware and $100 of value in software to me.  It lowers barrier of entry to mine, something I probably would never do otherwise, (don't have to deal with joining a pool) and enables quick and easy development without worry of low-level protocol.  If a lot more people had a tiny bitcoin income (even if it's really tiny), micropayments for many services seem more viable.
@_date: 2015-09-27 18:54:56
