Mycelium is one of the best wallets imo with many great possibilities (Sepa Transfer using cashila, lock Price/Value of stored Btc, in person buy and sell support, support of ledger wallet and trezor via USBOTG, BIP39 and many more). I love this wallet. If I am right, they want to expand similar to etherum and provide a universal Api and workaround to let other developers integrate their concepts themselves. The whole thing sounds very promising to me and I believe, they do right and have great potential. So... Yes I will participate.

Using addresses twice isn't done because of security issues. Once an address is made public it'd be more dangerous (attackable) to use it again than just creating a new one. Normally you don't have to care about the exact addresses wallets use. If you want to, generate a new recieving address and send prefered amount there.

That can change in the next few hours depending on how many people transact.
Edit: Right now for example trxs with fees between 30-50 sat/byte get confirmed within the next few blocks what I consider quick. For a normal trx that means you have to pay about $1.50.

Scalability isn't the most important factor to value a crypto. 99% of all alts are scam coins and their only purpose is pump and dump. The remaining one percent can't beat bitcoin regarding the fundamentals. Of those, bitcoin has the largest development team and excellent coders. With about 200,000 fullnodes all around the world it is the most distributed crypto network and many people voluntarily spend their resources to keep it running smoothly. If all you want is fast and cheap trxs, easily choose a coin of your desire but pay attention to not burning your fingers and loosing funds. You can actually also use paypal, which should fulfill your needs perfectly. But again, bitcoin *will* stay the king and it's just a matter of time until even more convenient scalability can be achieved (eg Schnorr/bech32/atomicswap along with LN).

Owning 1 BTC represents owning about 3 square miles of land on earth (of which is not water). Water included one would own about 9 square miles of the earth's surface.
All bitcoins ever available shared equally by all human beings would result in 0.0029 BTC for every single person.
By owning 1 BTC one owns 345 times as much as the average person would own under equally distributed conditions.
There are about 32 millions of millionaires in the world, so not every millionaire on earth will ever own 1 BTC (at the same time).
Even if just 1 percent of the world population would own bitcoin, every bitcoiner could only own 0.29 BTC on average.
Not even every tenth of us citizens could own 1 BTC.
If one Satoshi equaled $0.01, the price per bitcoin would be 1 million usd. (that's just about 60 times the current price).
If one wanted to buy a statue out of pure gold of oneself, one had to pay about 3750 BTC now ( The statue would have a weight of about 1600 kilograms.

Not true. There are 323,000,000 people in the US. At 4txs/sec, it would take 80,750,000 seconds, that's (/60/60/24) 934.6 days or about 2.5 years for everyone to open a channel. *If* you do the math, please do it *correctly*.
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:50:46
Then you can maybe explain why the spike of your new "old" incoming trxs appears so *suddenly* despite the fact that high fee trxs are cleared as slowly as new blocks are generated with just about 2k trxs each. Wouldn't in your theory old trxs reenter the game with the same rate, the high fee trxs are processed? To *me* the increase looks too sudden for that.
Edit: Spelling. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 23:13:44

Bitcoin is unusable? Right now trxs with 5-10 Sat/byte get confirmed within the next block. That's about $0.25 fee for a normal trx. I really don't see where it should be unusable.

That's exactly the scenario we will see more often from now on. Traders, especially future traders will get wrecked again and again until they realize going long and hodling, which is what the institutionals ('big money') are going to do in the first place, will always result in more profit in the end. Bitcoin is so scarce that it simply doesn't make sense to try and compete with the spot price.
@_date: 2019-07-03 07:15:12
Of course. Bitcoin has got some advantages others lack of, as I've pointed out earlier. Think of it:
- Bitcoin is exclusively leaderless, there is no sole entity deciding on bitcoin's fate beside the whole bitcoin economy and community by participating within the network's consensus rules.
- Bitcoin has a tremendous network effect which cannot be successful competed against due to first mover advantage
- Bitcoin has the highest amount of fullnodes running all around the world (about 75.000 at the time of writing) which renders bitcoin the most decentralized crypto (likely ever) in existence.
- Meanwhile bitcoin's mining distribution has also increased to healthy levels whereas its hashrate is the highest within the crypto space
- Bitcoin has a outstanding development team consisting of hundreds of very smart people all around the world
- Bitcoin has the leading support within companies, politics and the community as a whole
- Bitcoin's second layer solution lightning network which is built on the most secure blockchain in existence is able to process transactions blazing fast. Especially the aspect of having a totally secure first layer and a lightning fast second layer is the most genius step bitcoin could have taken.
In my view all this can hardly be beaten by any shitcoin (any other alt as well as all the results of forking/splitting the original chain).
All those shitcoins are just stupid pump and dump getting rich quick schemes which will finally die out when more use cases are built on top of bitcoin's blockchain. Surely it will still take some time but time is on bitcoin's side.

Stop trolling. Your initial submission content is about something completely different (look above!), see? Furthermore your concern-trolling means nothing to those who already dove deeper into that matter.
1) We can change this algo at any given time, rendering bitcoin quantum proof. But up until now it's not a substantial threat.
2) You are only affected if you reuse addresses for receiving **and** spending. But anyway, reusing addresses is not recommended and  no major wallet does so.
So stop trolling and do some real research *before* wasting our time.

In my view you cannot imagine how undervalued bitcoin is. The recent levels are ridiculous. Bitcoin is the hardest money ever been created. The whole amount is exactly countable and there is this cap of 21 million bitcoin, which cannot be cheated (you'll realize this once you get comfortable with and dive deeper into the technology behind bitcoin).
Bitcoin is poised to rise mid and long-term equally with the amount of those who acknowledge bitcoin as the solely sovereign money there is. Bitcoin being decentralized in any aspect (transactors, fullnodes, development, mining, ) makes it invulnerable to attacks and in my view it's the best hedge against fiat and stock market crashs.

The vulnerable versions are those lower 3.3.4 so be sure to use the latest version from their website.
Their website states:


I would suggest to simply download and verify the latest version, completely delete the old version and install the fresh one. After that simply resync your ledger with this latest version and you should be good to go.
@_date: 2019-07-08 20:50:36
Coinbase will of course allow you to withdraw your funds. Considering a hardware wallet for storing them securely is a good decision!
Although trezor is completely open source, which can also bear some risks in certain cases, in my view even though not being completely open source (there's a closed source secure element chip on the board) with the Ledgers you're good to go. The S doesn't hold as many assets at the same time (but you're free to uncomplicatedly exchange access to them for others quickly) and requires the mobile to support USB OTG for on-the-go usage, while the X supports Bluetooth.
So if it's your plan to hodl your bitcoin securely long-term, the S might be your choice.

You're right. In my view it's never too late to buy. But once we reach levels around $300k, price will begin to climb more slowly, volatility will decrease as well. I expect to see at least a $500k until 2025 where a certain saturation level will be reached. From then on trading bitcoin will be completely boring but even then it's not too late to get in. Since we'll have a stable bitcoin at that time but including all the advantages that come with it especially financial sovereignty.

Bitcoin will become the mainstream cash system once it's about to reach levels reflecting its true value. Around $500k per BTC we'll have an extremely low volatility, far broader adoption, LN optimized for easy daily usage. At the moment bitcoin gains trust and reliability by becoming a store of value. At reasonable price levels it renders into both: The store of value *and* the cash system.

His idea about scaling is exactly what bitcoin does. Implements a very efficient 'light weight' payment layer (Lightning network) on top of most secure settlement blockchain. It's a great view which in my opinion cannot be competed against by any other form of scaling. Ultra-fast second layer on top of the ultra-secure first layer. Ingenious!

Mempools of nodes very close to each other look more similar than mempools of nodes with high distance between them. By the time transactions are received by nearly every node but new incoming transactions aren't distributed as good as older ones, which already got the time to be wide spread. Once in a while every transaction reaches a miner's mempool, which will be processed if fee is high enough to make the miner decide to include the transaction into its next block. The average of what mempools look like is what is often refered to as *the* mempool, but the truth is there is nothing like *the* mempool.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:49:37
It's okay to think it's a bubble. Some do and sell what gives new hodlers the chance to join. Bitcoin is the black hole in our fraudulent fiat system and it's going to bring natural balance back. In my opinion it's not a bubble. The old banksters system was, but's that's now going to be corrected.

True. But it was / is given out by a central instance, that controls it and it devaluates it, just as needed. That can't happen to bitcoin, thus it's not comparable.


It also wouldn't have happened, there are some instances that don't want the Euro to be worth a lot (if *anything* at all)


Until the point (of saturation) I mentioned. Maybe a deflationary currency doesn't encourage people to spend, but at some point (then, when it's really needed) they will have to spend, for example to buy food or other necessities.


With 2nd layer solutions you will see bitcoin being used as a currency. Be patient, it's just the beginning. 


You really want to compare bitcoin to coffee or tulips or other perishable good? 


And that's the difference: Bitcoin keys will last forever exactly as the coins they secure. Thus it's really not comparable. You should take a look at it's advantages: Decentralization hindering central manipulation. Transferable worldwide, within seconds (depending on your set fee, 2nd layer solutions will speed that up anyway). Unbreakable cryptography (at least for the next years), easier to store than anything else (if you are taught and know how to).
Your view is reasonable for all the things that exist for a long time, but bitcoin is new. And in my opinion it will still last very long. Let's see, how it plays out.

No. You can restore your seed on a different compatible wallet such as Coinomi or grab all the keys from your seed using 


A desktop/software wallet is only as secure as the platform it is run on. It's possible that someone gets access to your keys in various ways. If you use a hardware wallet, your keys will never leave the device. If you store your coins on an exchange, it's not your coins. Why? Not your keys, not your coins!


It's exactly as easy as using any other wallet, but way more secure.

These won't trade as much as whales do thus creating a hodler-bottom which shouldn't be underestimated. Imho we have already seen this bottom around $5.8k. Whales selling around that point will certainly get slaughtered by "newcomers" as seen four times around the lows since december. This time it won't be different.

Already tested it. With [eclair lightning wallet for testnet]( and [lightning enabled starblocks coffeeshop]( It's fantastic. Try it out yourself, the payments are instant, confirmed in one second.
   
Edit: Tutorial.    
1. Download [eclair lightning wallet for testnet]( for android, and install.   
2. On homescreen swipe right to see your wallet's bitcoin address, which has to be fueld with some testnet BTC.   
3. So copy this bitcoin address and paste it into this [bitcoin testnet faucet]( to load up some testnet bitcoin for free.   
4. Once this transaction is confirmed, you can open a random lightning channel into the lightning network by swiping left from eclair homescreen, click the add button and choose *autoconnect*. Insert the amount of BTC, the channel shall be funded with (e. g. 0.1 BTC) and confirm ('open').   
5. Once the transaction to fund the channel is confirmed, you're ready to do lightning payments. So head up to [lightning enabled starblocks coffeeshop](   
6. Choose your desired type of coffee and add it to your chart. Click *Checkout* and you're presented the payment qrcode (you may have visited on any pc).   
7. If your are visiting starblocks from within your android, click *Open with your wallet* and allow to open eclair. In case you visit starblocks from a different device (without lightning wallet installed) scan the qr code from within your eclair wallet by just clicking the arrow (right bottom) on eclair homescreen, choose *Scan a payment request* to scan the checkout qr-code.   
8. Just click *Pay* and you will see the transaction for your coffee confirmed in a second.

For me it is a store of value. The amount of BTC I own has never decrease cause I just buy, hodl and spend. I never sell. Once I've spent some I instantly buy them back, often a bit more than I've spend. For me it turned out to be a good store of value.

Futures won't destroy bitcoin. In fact, after gold futures were settled in the seventies, the value of gold made a nice upwards movement and from then on traded on higher levels.

It has the first mover advantage, plenty of great developers, and no central authority. All the other shitcoins lack of this and that's why bitcoin will always be the reference currency. Bitcoin's best usecase can be found in some 3rd world countries. It's a working alternative to their own struggling fiat currencies and their economy. Just look at Venezuela or Tanzania.

To become a real currency bitcoin has to achieve some more maturing. In my opinion bitcoin has to accomplish three stages. 
1) Becoming a commodity.   
2) Becoming a strore of value.   
3) Becoming a currency.   
At the time of writing bitcoin is slowly leaving phase one, entering phase 2. At a certain level of saturation, let's say between $300k to $700k per btc, it's going to enter the last stage, being real currency. Transfers will then be made through 2nd layer solutions such as lighting, sidechains or atomic swappings between compatible crytos-chains. There's still some way to go, no doubt about it, but forward movement is definitely already recognizable.

Never store funds on exchanges (hackable, exit-scammable). So, yes. Blockchain.info might be safer.

The reason why users prefer centralized exchanges is the same why, although bitcoin exists for almost ten years already, the big majority prefers using fiat. They are ignorant and afraid. First they don't realize that bitcoin means *true* financial sovereignty. And once they do, they are afraid of the *responsibility* that comes with, it managing *your own things yourself!* This way there *is* **no one** to blame except yourself. No insurance given to you so that if you fuck up, it's solely your own problem, and there's no one, who bails you out.   
People rather have a corresponding service they are/may be able to interact with (banks, exchanges). This feels way more secure than installing a simple software (bitcoin, bisq) which, is told, enables you to manage many things on your own, peer-to-peer *without* a third party involved.   
But bitcoin has come a long way to where it is right now and its condition is quite fine! I predict the same for all kinds of decentralized services, of cource including bisq.   
It's a great service which is self-explanatory and open source! Once  firing up the setup you just follow the steps the software outlines, done.
Everybody should really give it a try!

Although bitcoin doesn't need an ETF it's very likely that when it gets approved price will rise (sharply) due to institutional investors getting in finally. Until then there will now be 6 further months in which bitcoin moves as purely as usual. Enough time for normal people to get a piece of the cake at cheap levels. It's probably the last opportunity to comfortably get in using dca over the next 6 months, at least that's what I'll be doing. Bitcoin is here to stay and many people got that already, ETF approved or not.

That's good news! The longer the stinky rats keep their hands off the better. In the long run bitcoin will turn out to be the rat poison. The later that is the more sustaining it'll be, the less rats will survive their last dinner.

Erik Voorhees was one of the segwit2x supporters, trying to get control over bitcoin about a year ago. Since then I haven't trusted him anymore and now, beside his own reputation fucked up he also ruins shapeshift's now. There would certainly have been other options than taking the path of KYC. Goodbye, shapeshift. Thanx for the nice time.

@_date: 2018-09-21 21:17:28
Although bitcoin doesn't need an ETF it's very likely that when it gets approved price will rise (sharply) due to institutional investors getting in finally. Until then there will now be 6 further months in which bitcoin moves as purely as usual. Enough time for normal people to get a piece of the cake at cheap levels. It's probably the last opportunity to comfortably get in using dca over the next 6 months, at least that's what I'll be doing.

Software wallets are as safe as the underlying platform is. Androids and iPhones can be compromised. I would really only store coins on a phone that I could afford to lose. Best is to use a (securely created) paperwallet. That's very safe and even for free, *if* it's anyhow possible for you to do so.

You forgot one little thing. Bitcoin has now been seen by the masses. It is now known that bitcoin exists and imho many institutional investors are standing at the sideline waiting to step in. Although your analysis might be right, I think the past isn't applicable anymore to make such forecast predictions. Perhaps a completely new cycle structure will set in soon...

LN doesn't "save" Bitcoin, it just extends it. Bitcoin was never in better constitution than it is right now, I don't know why you think it has to be saved!? No coin will ever replace bitcoin imho. It's the underlying standard of all cryptos and soon also of all the other currencies, that's what I think. LN and submarine swaps, as well as other BIPs will grant further fungibility, scalability and privacy. In my eyes the probability of bitcoin being replaced is *zero*. It's the only crypto driven by community instead of authority.

Get both and share your funds 50/50. I'd trust both. On the other hand for long-term storage you can also use a SECURELY created paperwallet. That does the trick even better (in terms of security).

In general this question is irrelevant because first, bitcoin is not about price but about technology. Second, marketcap doesn't tell you anything, price depends too much on current psychological resentment. If you're interested in doing the maths, might be a better place to ask.

That's good. I'm into bitcoin for almost five years and I never ever sold the tiniest part of a bitcoin. From time to time I pay using bitcoin but immediately buy the BTC back, often a bit more than I've spent. For me that's the best way being into bitcoin, above all for the long run. During volatile times I am enjoying my coffee riding the roller-coaster and my heartbeat stays calm and even, which certainly was not the case when I started. You get used to riding the roller-coaster if you did I a few dozen times. There have to be some fundamentalists who hodl no matter what. And I am one of them.
@_date: 2018-09-15 09:40:19

This. Also, wear gloves, a hat and sunglasses or a mask and put on clothes you don't wear regularly. Make sure the ATM doesn't follow KYC rules, if so, abort the process and try another.  Don't use the wallet to pay for services that know your identity. This way you stay completely anonymous.

In Germany you need a banking license to place a BTM afaik. The bafin stopped some active projects (who had no license) from working. But I think it's just a matter of time until some bank does, maybe fidor which is indeed crypto friendly. It's working in a few countries of Europe.

Every other crypto would just be a cheap copy of bitcoin, never gaining as much excellent contributers, node participation, community growth, media attention and level of decentralization as bitcoin did.

Are we talking about 0.71 or 0.071 BTC (above you wrote both)? Because nobody is so stupid as to store almost **0.71** on just a mobile. On the other hand: Losing just 0.071 BTC for being too lazy to read (their attention messages) or to write (down the seed or the private key) when it's about *your own funds* can still be considered a cheap lesson. You will do better next time.

You only need to back something which is produced out of thin air. That's not possibly with bitcoin thus it doesn't have to be backed.
@_date: 2018-08-21 07:35:43
Does one really need that? I don't think so. Wallets do their job well and what you want to do is far too complicated for most the people. Many of them are not even able to use wallets the right way. Doing those things manually is only for those who like to understand the technical things. I wouldn't recommend messing around with private keys in an online environment!

At least he paid attention not to call his peecash *bitcoin*, probably due to the running lawsuit.

For example you could design a cool bitcoin sticker, let it print and send to you (it's cheap, nowadays) and every where you are going to be, you hand some out to random people. You can also "loose" the one or the other at bus stops, stations, cinema walls in the city, the airport or shopping malls.

Nothing. Cause a softfork only needs miners to be upgrading (in the case of segwit 95% of the last 1000 blocks have to be mined segwit and to finally have it activated, 95% of another 1000 blocks).

@_date: 2017-02-22 22:38:41
They haven't decided yet. Perhaps they want to wait until a majority votes for segwit. Also they could be in favor with the current situation cause they can earn pretty high fees voting just for core. Who knows.

My thought: ViaBTC is known for supporting bitcoin unlimited (aka BU). They strongly deny segwit (which would enable lightning networks aka LN) because they fear a lot transactions would be done off-chain by then and would them cause mining losses (which is crap in my eyes as sooner or later every transaction wants to be "set in stone" thus manifested in the bitcoin blockchain). So they try to divide the bitcoin community to get more followers (for the BU idea to let miners decide themselves how big their every very block created is, which would lead to sometimes outrages fee profits, especially in times like these, when mempool is that crowded). With about 200 000 followers r/bitcoin is one of the biggest bitcoin communities whereas r/btc is just about a tenth that big. So they proclaim censorship on r/Bitcoin, something that is today an emotive word, and tell people to join r/btc (BU-Classic-XT-supporting-Hardforking-Centralising-shortly-said-being-against-original-bitcoin-develpment-team-core). They don't mention that this "censorship" is mostly due to violation of r/Bitcoin community guidelines which you can find on the right -&gt;.
Their whole thing reminds me a bit of some political movements, which try to fool a lot of people, telling them lies, to get more power, centralised in their very own person to, in the end act against this community. Like in US, Turkey, Poland, and so on. These call it fake news and rampage against media, those call in censorship. People, don't let yourself fool you.

If you made a backup of your wallet.dat file just download and install newest bitcoin core client 0.13.2, start the client and let it begin syncing. Then stop the client and replace the containing wallet.dat file with your backup file. Start it again and WAIT until the client is synced. Your bitcoins should be fine. The wallet file only has a password/passphrase if your selected "encrypt wallet" and set one in your first version, but I assume you didn't do that, so it should work.
@_date: 2017-02-02 10:31:47
With segwit activated the hypothetical blocksize would be 1.6 MB. 
multiplied by 4 meant a hypothetical 6.4 MB blocksize. Now we have medium 3 tx/s, than you'd have medium 19.2 tx/s. A 6.4 times increase. That's 1152 tx/minute.
@_date: 2017-02-23 09:13:50


Yeah. Maybe slow, expensive and difficult to use. But at least it's the first monetary system, where one is really in control of oneown's wealth. So... Shit compared to PayPal? If it's all about quickness, okay (as long as segwit isn't activated). But if we talk about sovereignty and security?? There is nothing better than bitcoin! Even if it is STILL slow, expensive and difficult to use. If newbies would read some information BEFORE instead of afterwards, they would have way less stress.

We were surprised ourselves getting this curve. We didn't simply drew that line but we did it a different way: we worked with  In logscale with weekly candles (on bitstamp) we chose the lowest points on 09/21/2015 and 10/10/2016 and connected those to a line as that's the worst thinkable and most pessimistic line since bitcoin had its turnaround and began to climb again. Then we switched to linear scale and voila: we got this curve with exponential growth, which was nearly never crossed and underun by bitcoin's value, a nice surprise! Try it yourself.
Edit: We think the first big rise was just a bubble that in this outrageous form never appeard again. Instead, after years of maturing and lesson-learning we now got a steady growth which is result of bitcoins rising adoption.

I suggest wallet upgrades of the following kind: wallet developer enable CDM. "Choose Desired Miner" let's the user decide, which miner(s) shall process the transaction. A window pops up, where you have to choose. "Choose all - faster - no politics" or "Choose specific(s) - slower - have a voice", where it can be chosen from a list of active miners (during set timeframe last 24h/last week/...). Wallet could calculate time-frame for transaction using probability of finding a block for given miner(s) (and given fee). That way we, the users, could have the voice we deserve!

With a market cap just about 20 billion and increasing adoption there's no chance the volatility will slow down anytime soon. The opposite is the case. Expect an increase in both, volatility and price until market is saturated. While this happening bitcoin will mature as it has already done by far. Development needs discussion, no matter of which kind and there will always be extreme positions. That's not a bug. It's a feature. The truth lies somewhere between.

I am no expert but I think that should be possible (I heard about raw transactions and the "transaction accelerator" must also work specifying a certain miner). Every wallet should have the function to list all active (in specific time frame, last hour, last week) miners and/or their claimed support (which is easy to reverify on the block chain, - &gt; automated miner rating system for if they are honest). User could choose one or more miners be 'd be willing waiting for finding a block) This way the user could position himself and could have heavy influence on mining decentralization. That was a great feature! Could someone please implement it? At least in mycelium and ledger wallet?

Miners can't be convinced to activate segwit. They do it or don't do it themselves. There are mainly three types of miners: Those who are already signaling segwit, those who use core but aren't signaling segwit and those who signal Bitcoin unlimited. The first ones have already understood the great benefits that come with segwit, above all the addressing of transaction malleability. They want to take the whole bitcoin ecosystem forward and don't care about greed and personal wealth, exact Satoshi's manner I'd claim. The second ones are happy with how bitcoin works right now. With a mempool always crowded they are granted high fee profits for their block processings and pretend to behave most original to Satoshi's vision by conservatively just stand and watch without giving the growing system the process it could need. The last ones' intention is to make the most out of the system for themselves, not just for now but even for the future. That's surely not in harmony with Satoshi's vision, cause its egocentric and leads away from decentralization. If miners could decide themselves on how big their blocks are, every miner would try to include as much transactions as possible into a block to ensure the biggest possible profit in fees. In other words: The miner with the biggest hashrate would always make the most profit because it's his "luck" to find most of the blocks, always leaving an empty mempool. In the end there were just one or two very big miners dictating the whole ecosystem. Signaling segwit support is in my eyes the most honorable and galant move a miner could do and those who do take bitcoin a big step ahead.
@_date: 2017-03-21 11:12:23
Afaik fullnodes validate blocks, so they are not important? If BU would hardfork, there were only 600 nodes considering BU blocks valid. The other 6000 nodes would just reject those blocks as invalid. In other words, bitcoin would stay bitcoin, BU had its own chain, but as you've said: If it's so easy and cheap to setup some fullnodes, somebody would certainly just setup 1000 reconfigured BU nodes and could disturb the BU network hardly. I don't think nodes are unimportant, they consider blocks valid or invalid.
@_date: 2017-03-19 07:52:06
And as seen some days before, even 80% BU nodes are fake nodes crashing at the same time and were up again at the same time. This smells like one guy operates these nodes, regrettably completely centralized. This can't work.

And if you might think this proposal would have centralizing effect: It's more likely the opposite is the case. As I said: the option on top is to "choose all miners". If users chooses that, it's processed as always. No centralizing effect. It's the second option that gives user ability to choose certain miner(s). Perhaps one, user agrees most with in political manner. Perhaps one, who processes tx a bit cheaper than others. Or perhaps one with just little hashpower to regain decentralization. So I don't think it forceably leads to more centralization.
Also imaginable is to offer users "Choice Profiles", too. Such as: "All segwit supporting", "All BIP XYZ supporting", "All miners that don't process empty blocks" and so on.
The whole thing would be way more decent than a POW change and wouldn't need any kind of fork.

In my view trading this valuable bitcoin is treating it like a bitch. If everbody always did it would be hard to achieve a sustainable value at all. But that is just my view. It's an action of greed which might as well go wrong. Additionally you have to always trust those fuckin' exchanges which I prefer to avoid. Eventually most people trading experience losses instead of profits. So just hodling, spending and replacing seems more calming and more reasonable to me.

The transaction mempool contains about 60000 transactions right 
now. All of them want to be processed and wait for being taken into next blocks created by the miners. Your set fee was probably too small so that the transaction priority is in the eyes of the miners low. Every block contains about avg. 2000 txs, and is produced about every ten minutes. So it would take 30 blocks or 300 minutes to completely empty the mempool, if no new transactions came in. But at the time of writing we have about 3 tx/second entering them mempool, thats also max processing capacity which means, the mempool will probably still stay that crowded for a while. Also with such a crowded mempool, automated fee set by wallets and also people manually will be also higher than average which means it could still take a while for your transaction to be processed. You can check preferably fee on  and also on

I don't compare BU hashrate to Segwit's. If at all, I compare BU to Core and I see about 2/3 blocks mined by core in an economic environment where 9/10 validating fullnodes are Core-nodes. BU is crap and HF will never happen!

@_date: 2019-03-29 10:14:00
Some things to consider using a paperwallet: Save the bitaddress.org website onto a new dedicated mobile storage (usb, sd) and use it **offline** in a secure environment, for example a Linux live system to generate your keys. Make sure you're really disconnected from the internet!! Also there might occur problems when you try to spend only partially from the paperwallet in terms of change address, etc. So for long term storage, it's okay. But once you want to spend from it, sweep it (completely transfer the funds) into any open source wallet you consider secure. Best and recommended wallets can be found here:  Mycelium works great handling paperwallets for me. Nevertheless state of the art are hardware wallets like ledger or trezor. They are damn secure and provide comfortable usability.

Could maybe clarify?
@_date: 2017-03-21 10:27:50
At the moment block fee is always about between 1 to 3 btc per block. Let's do the math on block rewards:
Right now: 12.5 btc
2020: 6.25 btc
2024: 3.125 btc
2028: 1.5075 btc
2032: 0.75 btc. 
So in about 11 years reward is just about 1.5 btc. So, does it really first matter in about 50 years?
Edit: If there was an increase of blocksize just to 2MB it would probably already matter in 2020.

Yes. That would make all legacy addresses (beginning with 1...) invalid and unspendable. You don't want to do this, do you?

I wouldn't say that in general. He just cares quite a lot for the very core of bitcoin. Which is keeping decentralization as much as possible. That's also the reason for his proposal to reduce blocksize. And I have to say...I agree with him. At least on those two topics!

He basically says quantum computing is only a concern if you reuse addresses **including spending from them.** *Recieve only* as much as you want, its quantum proof. But once you spend from an address (because you reveal the public key to it by doing so, which might once be the attack vector, qc will be using to calculate the privkey from the pubkey), be sure to move the remaining funds to a fresh one.
But that's what actually any modern wallet does. Unless you mess around with paperwallets. Then you should actively follow Andreas' advice.

Only 200 million people will ever be able to own 0.1 BTC at the same time. That's just 2.7 percent of the world population. Or to put it that way: less than one out of 30 people could own (a maximum of) 0.1 BTC at the same time. The remaining 29 would have no bitcoin at all in that case....maths is so illustrating. ;-)

What exactly do you want to achieve by increasing the number of outgoing transactions? Speed up the initial blockchain download? This speed depends on different factors such your bandwidth, but more importantly your hardware. Validating any ever occurred bitcoin transaction since its beginning takes time especially for periods when there was much on-chain traffic. Just be more patient and look forward to having your own fullnode running soon.
@_date: 2017-03-17 23:09:57
BUCoin has just about 600 fullnodes worldwide. I'd call that quite vulnerable and dangerous to bet on something like this! Bitcoin has about 6000 fullnodes worldwide, rising! I am excited how an Altcoin like BUCoin will survive under such poor circumstances. !remindme 1 year

By running a full node you choose a certain software version with specific set of rules which can be understood as a vote being involved in forming consensus. More fullnodes running means less chance of the network being attacked by 'invalid' blocks which might be addressed to accompanying malicious nodes.


In terms of being a node this aspect only plays a secondary role. In terms of mining it does.


The best idea is to use the fullnode as wallet to verify the validity of blocks and transactions yourself. Also you exclusively propagate your own transactions without a third party being involved. This way you achieve maximum sovereignty and privacy and really *use* bitcoin as it is meant to be. Acting sovereign without relying on a third party means *securing the network.*

1. Seriously. It'll look much more worse than in 2008. Just look at the numbers do some research and you'll find many experts predicting some big bubbles popping. Bonds, yields, equities, housing and real estate, (eventually also USD). Hedge with bitcoin, gold, silver and you'll likely be on the safe(r) side.
2. Bitcoin is still tiny, meaning that if you get your piece of cake now, you'll very likely be in a quite good position once the real increase of value begins. $100k sounds astonishing but it's not. Imho the real value lies somewhere between $500k and $1m per BTC. Once we reach these price levels, volatility will have been decreased quite a lot and bitcoin then will not only be the perfect store of value but also the perfect medium of exchange (with lightning and some other scalability enhancements improved, which will definitely happen imho). Govs and banks are likely to have this foresight as well. Unlike last time when they missed the train completely during the dotcom area.
3. There's is no other meaningful crypto other than bitcoin. Ethereum has big issues with scalability but in the first place with central control. Especially the central control issue won't be solved anytime soon. The same is true for any other altcoin. But that's just my opinion.
@_date: 2019-03-31 07:53:00
That's why blocksize won't be raised until it becomes really necessary. Requirement of resources (bandwidth!, cpu, ram, storage) is already quite high. To keep bitcoin as decentralized as possible we need *more* users to run their own fullnodes, not less.

Because for bitcoin to become real p2p cash and not 'just' a store of value its volatility has to decrease. Drastically. Expect it to decrease on BTC's way up to a market cap of at least five to ten trillion USD. Respectively a price of at least $250k to $500k per BTC. When reaching these levels, imho lightning (which is the *real* p2p-cash) will have evolved to mainstream medium of exchange and it'll be accepted by almost online merchant.

You could try installing mycelium on an android device, choose offline wallet from menu (upper right) and then choose "masterseed". Choose your amount of words (12/18/24), enter all of them (correctly) and mycelium should import/create your wallet. BIP32 is automatically recognized, I think.

For the first time in human history bitcoin enables you to be really financially sovereign as, if you handle it correctly, no one can take your money away from you. That's why it's important! Furthermore you can send bitcoin to anyone in the world (if there's an Internet connection) very quickly, that's why it is useful.

I would answer your questions as follows but I am no expert. So if any expert could also weigh in on these questions that would be quite nice!


On the one hand it depends on how well your node is connected within the network. The more channels your node is participating in, the more likely the chance is to be involved in payment routes. If the network is big enough, in my view it will also depend on the fee level you set. It's likely payments will take the cheapest route one day so offering low fees would increase the likelihood of being involved within routing.


Hard to say but I think the raspi will do the job well for quite some time, depending on the growth rate of LN. But one thing is for sure. The required resources *will* increase with the work  to be done by your LN node. As of now it might be difficult to put that in numbers. But one should expect the requirement to upgrade the hardware one day.


In my view: Yes. But that's just a guess, based on no facts beside that I read a comment here from a user who mentioned to have already earned something like 20 or 30 bucks the month because a lot of "bigger" payments ran over his node.
Anyone else?

Take a look at this:  A good friend and I figured out this curve. Read, how we did that:
We were surprised ourselves getting this curve. We didn't simply drew that line but we did it a different way: we worked with  In logscale with weekly candles (on bitstamp) we chose the lowest points on 09/21/2015 and 10/10/2016 and connected those to a line as that's the worst thinkable and most pessimistic line since bitcoin had its turnaround and began to climb again. Then we switched to linear scale and voila: we got this curve with exponential growth, which was nearly never crossed and underun by bitcoin's value, a nice surprise! Try it yourself.
Edit: We think the first big rise was just a bubble that in this outrageous form never appeard again. Instead, after years of maturing and lesson-learning we now got a steady growth which is result of bitcoins rising adoption.

Once banks start to restrict customers to access their 'own' money by applying *capital controls*, *confiscations* and *hair cuts*, everyday person will suddenly see the benefit of using bitcoin jumping into their eyes. But I fear it'll be too late for those then, unless they participate in bitcoin rather sooner than later.


Bitcoin is not about privacy. In the first place it's about censorship-resistance. Nobody can stop you from sending and recieving bitcoin. And if you're good at *securing your keys*, it's also very difficult to take your bitcoin away. These are bitcoin's true benefits.
Educate yourself and start using it! For me it was one of the best decisions ever in my life and it'll very likely change the rest of the world in a good way as well.

Many of your assumptions show you didn't really do your homework.
- It is time to do something *now* or they risk their system failing
- They don't have to change something *because* of bitcoin. But if they don't change anything, bitcoin *will be* there.
- You don't have to wait for people not buying bitcoin to die until real adoption  starts. The first government/bank that decides to turn the dollar their back for bitcoin will be *the* catalyst.
- Rethink your timeframe, it'll not be at least 20-30 years. In fact, it can happen *very* quick.
- Bitcoin won't lose its position to any meaningless alt. Remember my words. Not a single altcoin is more secure than bitcoin. Any of them are quite easily attackable at very low cost. If they were of any importance, they would have already been wiped out. It's just that no one cares about them. They are *meaningless*.

Maybe. I would think they rolled out their new update to everyone today and a lot of people have 'automatic update' enabled within their android. Plus from what I see, mycelium seems to be doing some (more) background activity recently. Maybe after everybody's update any wallet tries to sync simultaneously and that's what causing our sync issue. Dunno. That may be the reason why it's recommended to run a fullnode...

To be honest. We're not far away of that scenario. Look at Venezuela, Turkey, Cyprus, Ukraine, Greece, Nigeria and many other countries. Their economic and monetary system fails and their money printing presses ran hot to keep liquidity up in the market. It's a devils circle that'll soon reach western countries like US and EU as well. Their strategy of continously doing QE will very likely end up in hyperinflation. But before that happens they'll try to save the system by going through another big bailout, where we, the customers, will be wanted to pay the bailout bill (methods see above). Only *this* time, other than in 2008, there's bitcoin. One should keep that in mind. 


When the end game begins you won't have to care about the story as a whole. Almost anybody will be part of the happening. Indicators will be bank account restrictions and increasing prices for your daily living. Then at latest you should have a little reserve in bitcoin, maybe gold and silver along with some things you need to live for about 1 to 6 months. But that's just my guess. And that's what I'll be doing.

The possibility for a comfortable recovery check without the need of a second device was demanded for quite a long time with the ledger. If you're quick, it takes you about five minutes. I advise anybody to check his/her seed words (if not already done in a different way), as some have run into difficulties with unreadable written down words, missing words, wrong order etc. If you see your seed is somehow not correct you're still able to move the funds to a new seed.

Someone sending you funds to an address you *never* used is near to **not possible**. It's likely, your address was used (for change) but you didn't notice. Lookup the address in a blockexplorer to find out more about how often in was involved in transactions. In general addresses are hashed public keys. So likelyhood of someone also knowing the private key to one of **your** ledger addresses equals zero as well(unless someone got access to your seed backup). But if someone had only one private key, he would also need your extended public key to compromise you completely. Or, as I said, access to your seed backup. Otherwise you're safe.

Definitely a spam attack. Lowest fee trxs with 1 up to 10 sat/B suddenly drastically increasing. The likelyhood of different people's sudden intention to synchronously transact bitcoin equals zero. When the attackers get, that the attack is going to become more and more expensive they stop and mempool transaction count returns to normal. I could imagine various scenarios of who is behind this and why.

Depending on the amount you want to trade trading in person might be a thing.
Define the rules of the deal (Exchange rate provider, amount in BTC to be traded) beforehand. When meeting, exactly follow the plan of the deal and don't get talked into another scammy deal that you can't grasp completely and you make a (simple maths or whatever) mistake... 
From what I've seen most people in the space are nice and affable but there might be others one actually doesn't want to deal with.
Be attentive. If somebody might not be  legit abort the deal and leave the situation in a friendly and 
inconspicuous way.
Some considerations.
Meet in a public place. Since Bitcoin transactions aren't reversible, always exchange the cash at first. Verify the authenticity of the handed cash. Count it, then send the bitcoin. Finish your drinks and leave.

Liquid FAQ
What is Liquid?
Liquid is an implementation of a federated sidechain - a private blockchain with different features, capabilities, and benefits than the main Bitcoin blockchain.
The Liquid Network was built specifically to address the particular needs of exchanges and enables the rapid, confidential and secure transfer of funds between participants, providing a solution to the inherent problem of delayed transaction finality on the Bitcoin network.
Liquid’s sidechain is built on top of the Elements code-base and uses Blockstream’s Strong Federation technology to support the 1-to-1 exchange of bitcoin between chains.
What are the benefits of Liquid?
Faster Trading – Near instant bitcoin transfers between exchanges allow your users to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities like never before.
Enhanced Efficiency – Market makers can improve their capital efficiency by reducing balances held across multiple exchanges.
Better Privacy – Liquid supports Confidential Transactions for bitcoin amounts transferred in the system, which protects your users from exposure.
Superb Reliability – Built using the battle tested Bitcoin code-base, Liquid software is highly reliable. Also, since Liquid uses signed blocks instead of mining, blocks are always one minute apart instead of an unknown amount of time like Bitcoin.
Liquid achieves all of these benefits while providing users with the security of trading real, verifiable bitcoin-backed assets. All Liquid users can ensure that the amount of bitcoins inside of the Liquid Network is identical to the amount of bitcoins frozen in the main chain.
What will Liquid look like to users of a participating exchange?
Exchanges that are members of the Liquid Network have the ability to send bitcoins to other participating exchanges through the Liquid Network. They can then do this on behalf of customers to send money between different exchanges. First a customer would request a deposit address from the destination exchange. This address would be similar to a Bitcoin address but begin with the letters CT. The end user would then take this address to the source exchange and request a withdrawal from that exchange and enter the destination address. The source exchange would then send bitcoins through the Liquid Network to the other exchange who would wait for confirmations of the deposit and credit your account. Users never need to directly access the Liquid Network or hold bitcoins on the Liquid Network - exchanges will do this for you.
Who benefits from Liquid?
Liquid benefits participating Bitcoin exchanges and Bitcoin businesses, as well as their customers.
The participating exchanges and Bitcoin businesses deploy the software and hardware that make up the Liquid network, so that they can peg in and out of the Bitcoin blockchain and offer Liquid’s features to their traders. Liquid provides a more secure and efficient system for exchange-side bitcoin to move across the network.
End users benefit from the greater liquidity Liquid enables between exchanges.
Why use a sidechain?
The Bitcoin blockchain excels at offering the permissionless, trustless, and censorship resistant transfer of value. However, achieving those means comes at the expense of a deterministic transaction flow and expense of mining. A sidechain allows a different set of trade-offs that allow privacy and rapid finality of asset transfer at the expense of being a permissioned network and trust of the functionaries.
Extending the Bitcoin protocol using a sidechain allows the main chain itself to remain secure, specialized and robust whilst its underlying properties underpin the smooth operation of the sidechain.
Whereas Bitcoin is secured by Proof of Work, assets on the Liquid blockchain are secured by a Strong Federation of trusted functionaries. This allows transaction on Liquid to reach a state of finality faster and more reliably than those on the Bitcoin blockchain.
What are the differences between Liquid and Lightning Network?
The Liquid sidechain is purpose-built to cater for the needs of exchanges, brokers and traders, enabling the rapid, secure and confidential transfers of large amounts of bitcoin between participants. The use of a blockchain allows for transfers to be made that are not bound by such things as a single user’s channel capacity. Transaction finality is assured once a transaction is included within a block and there is no risk of chain reorganization due to the process of Strong Federation block signing. Transactions are therefore not subject to delay due to the lack of cooperation of other parties. Funds in the sidechain can be increased by member exchanges pegging more bitcoin into the sidechain.
The Lightning Network is designed to enable the near-instant transfer of small or micro value payments between linked channel members and merchants. Transactions are limited in amount to channel capacity, specifically the capacity of the smallest channel in the ‘hops’ from sender to receiver. This means that there are cases where you may wish to send bitcoin through Lightning and a new channel would need to be created. This would require a new on-chain transaction in the Bitcoin network. To reduce the risk of monetary losses, the current maximum channel capacity is currently limited by the protocol to around 0.168 BTC. Transfers on the Lightning Network can also experience delays if a payment must route through parties that are not on-line, resulting in the potential need to open a new channel in order to route around them.
How decentralized is Liquid?
Liquid is a federated sidechain, so it will never be as decentralized as Bitcoin. However, Liquid is designed to remove control from any single party, geographic location, or political jurisdiction. The Liquid Network is operated by functionary servers, each securely hosted by geographically dispersed, independently owned and operated Bitcoin exchanges.
Updates are deployed by consensus of participants within the network. No single party, including Blockstream, can control the Liquid network, and furthermore, no single entity is in control of more than a single Liquid functionary server.
What are Confidential Transactions?
Liquid is designed to enable auditing and openness to any network participant, as well as confidentiality between transacting parties. Like Bitcoin, Liquid transactions are viewable by everyone in the network, so Confidential Transactions hides transaction amounts from everyone except for the parties directly involved in the transaction itself. In doing so, it minimizes front-running risks that occur through blockchain analysis.
Confidential Transactions fundamentally provide privacy for any end user that requires it, regardless of reason. An example use case for this level of commercial transaction privacy will become more apparent as the cryptocurrency trading ecosystem matures, and larger market makers and financial institutions begin trading bitcoin across exchanges. They will want to move bitcoin between their accounts at different exchanges, without broadcasting the amounts to the general public, providing assurances that their trading strategies and holdings are not exploited by potential adversaries.
Private solvency proofs are also possible using Confidential Transactions in that you do not need to show the full amount held but instead that a threshold is met in order to prove reserves are adequate. For example: you can show that your user account balances sum up to the total assets held without showing individual amounts or even what that sum is. You do not even need to reveal the total number of users.
Liquid makes compliance easy, whilst providing privacy of transactions. Something that would not be possible without the use of Confidential Transactions.
Does Liquid support assets other than bitcoin?
Liquid was built using the Elements blockchain platform and therefore has multi-asset issuance capabilities built in through the Confidential Assets feature. In its first release, Liquid will support Bitcoin only. Future versions of Liquid may support other assets, such as other cryptocurrencies or assets issued by participants.
What is the price for Liquid?
Access to Liquid beta is free. There is no requirement for beta participants to move forward with a commercial contract. If you’re interested in getting early access to Liquid, request to join the beta program. Once the Liquid Network goes live, there is a monthly subscription fee.
When is a public launch expected/planned?
The network is live as of September 27, 201

Let's say 50% is Chinese hashrate, suddenly plugged off. Difficulty adjustment would not set in after 14 days at latest but after 28 days. Remaining hashrate would increase faster during that period due to (new) miners setting up new hardware to get an advantage in stake of bitcoin rewards for the future. The overall scenario wouldn't be that dramatic imho.

I run two full nodes and we would like to first see the segwit activated as soon as possible. The fixes and changes that come with it will bring bitcoin a big step ahead. As long as there are times the mempool decreases to nearly zero it isn't worth a hardfork it just isn't necessary. It's nice to see blocks full, but seldom much hung over tx. If that changes, it is time for a hardfork but now it's time for segwit.

That may be right. But it leads away from decentralization. We need more nodes to grant network security not less. Big blocks can only be processed by high end hardware equipment and fast broadband connections which not many can afford. So you sacrifice the networks security only to have low fees? That's not working in the long run!

No. As far as I understand it, segwit delivers the corresponding malleability fix. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 08:30:43
Some things to put right here. Segwit increases blocksize up to 2 to 4 MB. Segwit2x raises blocksize to 8MB. That's completely unnecessary since lightning capabilities trough segwit enable unlimited transactions at very low cost. Such emails have no other reason than misinformation to uphold (the non existent) power structure within the miners.
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:09:47
Segwit is a softfork. There's no need to do anything. Just relax. Everything will be working as it did and does. You don't have to use wallets, exchanges or services that "support" segwit. You can go on doing exactly as you did all the time. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:48:04

You're right. Miners are just services which have kind of veto. But as long as there's at least one 'good' miner, the veto disappears. So the truth is miners are just and plain services with no real power against a network of thousands of validating (full) nodes. Look how how we did the segwit update by UASF, this is how it works.

I think it's all about decentralization. Smaller blocks mean less hardware requirements on running a full node, means node network can expand. Once segwit activates and lightning's running we'll see faster transactions and reduced fees. @_date: 2017-01-15 09:26:09
No. Just right now it is possible to get transactions through the network with nearly no fees. That is caused by a very low transaction mempool.

Open bazaar destroyed its reputation late last year during the segwit2x drama.

Don't try to trade. You'll fail. Always store coins in a wallet where you control keys. Never talk too much about how much funds you own. Run a fullnode. If possible only use open source software. Make backups of your seed or keys and keep them in a safe place. Try hodling, even when we're in rollercoaster. Spend some coins from time to time and immediately buy the amount back in bitcoin. Don't get scammed by offerings which sound too good to be true. Consider a hardware wallet for bigger amounts of coins. Do dollar cost averaging. Have fun.

The truth is there's only one developer creating the code for segwit2x. That's Jeff Garzik who works for BitPay for several years already. BitPay is puppet of Bitmain and Jihan Wu. Or is it the other way around? Who cares. Anyway,   those two or three guys wish to take over control of bitcoin. So they fooled some companies to get on board and settled the [NYA]( Most of those companies probably don't even understand what they signed for and will certainly pull back. However many others though [(NOB2X)]( seem to have already stated their disregards concerning SegWit2x and won't participate. That's it.

Offline wallets grant you the highest security. So... Get yourself a hardware wallet (Ledger, Trezor) or a new (secure and offline-generated) paperwallet. Software and online wallet are way riskier due to compromised OS and/or hack-attacks.
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:16:07
It seems bread wallet will automatically become a segwit2x wallet by following the majority hashrate and a whole lot a users won't get what's going on. Also node tethering is a bad option since, again, normal users won't get what's going on and what they had to do. In fact they don't want to do anything. They just want to use their bitcoin wallet, which is as you provide it no longer possible.
@_date: 2017-08-08 06:03:12
Correct. But hodling should also be done in the right way. That means owning the private keys (as...if you don't own the keys, you don't own the coins). So get yourself a hardware wallet like ledger or trezor and don't forget to backup the seed. Also you can use a paperwallet but you should know what you're doing.

I thought about that, too. But I think it's still too early to do something like that. If today a burger costs 1 mBTC I would certainly wonder why its just 0.5 mBTC next year or 0.1 mBTC in 2019.
But if the price stabilizes say in about 10 years or so around $300k to $500k per BTC  then volatility will also be decreased as the market gets saturated. *Then* at the latest its time to value goods in BTC (or mBTC, most probable Satoshi).

This is sweet. What if the bank itself is the robber? Bitcoin removes the need for trusted third parties, that's one of the primary concepts imho. Reinvolving a third party you have to trust, contradicts the nature of bitcoin itself. Giving away (a copy of) your seed is giving away *your exclusive control* over the coins. If at the same time you chose *a bank* to be your trusted third party... Facepalm, imho.

I do it that way: Open this site  watching "Fees/size (satoshis/byte)" for some time, to see what the medium fee is right now in the mempool. I add another 20-40% on that value just to be sure. This way my transactions get always processed within the next 2 blocks. That's how I do it for quite some time and it was always good.
Edit: Also there is this site  and this one  That latter shows always to high fees, the former also did that but got better in the last time.

"Hodl" symbols the strong intend of holding the coins (for a long time) and not selling them of fear or greed, no matter what. For me it also implies to be owning my private keys (and not keeping them in any online wallet or exchange). If you don't own the keys, you don't own the coins.

You don't store the bitcoin, cause they're stored in the blockchain. You just store the private key(s) which lets you control the coins on the chain. In the purchase process the atm asks for an address to send the bought amount to. Just give one that is generated within a software installed on a computer. That way your btc are stored on a hard drive. Don't forget to backup (backing up the wallet file and  the seed).
@_date: 2018-10-04 07:09:22

Thx. But you didn't point out what speaks against it. SPV wallets are just "lightweight" wallets (not storing the blockchain themselves) and thus cannot act as full nodes, that's clear. And after downloading the blockchain and bitcoin qt beginning to work you'd have your own copy.

There's always the need and if you do so you support the fundamentals namely decentralization. Doing so is a honorable thing, imho.

Consensus building is anyway a slow process. More important is the network's size since it's that what fuels  the power of decentralization.

If I may have a word: I tried to scan his qr with mycelium, getting an error message. I suppose it's because of the missing colon between bitcoin and 1...so coinbase (or which app does the qr code come from?) generated the qr code faulty.

The question would be. Where did the actually sent-to address come from?

Consequently check mempool for occurrence of your address(as out). Once you find a corresponding trx, track down the sender's IP and compare to IP(s) used by your "service". Does anything match? If yes, that should be evidence enough.
@_date: 2017-08-29 07:18:37
HD means your keys / addresses are made from one seed (12...24 words) and has nothing to do with how many users use the wallet. Addresses beginning with 3... are segwit-addresses and is true that mycelium is not yet supporting segwit addresses. So you have to: Find a wallet which already supports segwit address and *also* HD seeds backup and restore.

It's still in early alpha and it's still very very young as well. Consider bitcoin took almost ten years to reach the point we're now at, it being a solid settlement layer. Give it another year to evolve and you'll have a beautiful piece of p2p-decentralized easily scalable payment network on top, capable of routing payments at highest speeds and tremendous privacy.

That is right. The chaotic high frequency trading and those quite abnormal trading volumes have obviously come to an end. Now way more realistic relations show up! Also it is clear now: We don't need a blocksize increase right now. What we need is segwit, but that's a different story. Miners who vote against it, do that only for reasons of protest. They're greedy and grasping and cannot get enough. Some of them even mine empty blocks to let the mempool increase, which also leads to higher fees. If you want the bitcoin network to grow stronger and healthier support segwit! If you are a miner, change mining pool to a segwit-friendly one! If a blocksize increase will really be needed and necessary, it'll come up, as there's always the possibility to hardfork.
@_date: 2017-01-25 22:51:46
What is their technically excellent solution? Are you talking about the 38% capacity increase? Or about LN? The miners are afraid of segwit. With lightning networks possible they fear too much goes off-chain resulting in a loss of fee profit. But they forget: There'll always be the need of "real" set-in-stone on-chain txs and in the face of rising adoption also these will increase. Secondly bitcoin's value will probably also rise'n'rise causing a bigger return at same rates. 
@_date: 2017-01-20 02:54:58
The campaign that is underway to convince them (not to hardfork for now) is we, the full nodes, never letting any hardfork happen until segwit is activated!

1) If I want to send bitcoin I want to send BTC. If I want to send b cash, I want to send BCH and in case of another split in November if I wanna send Segwit2x coin, I wanna send B2X or anything like that. That's not so difficult, it's it? 
2) I am not very pleased by your option of "node tethering". If you really want to be a multi coin wallet, you should setup nodes on any coin you support. Or will you rely on a third party to provide access to given chains. You cannot expect the user to feed your wallet with certain node addresses and this way withdraw from the affair.
If you won't support bitcoin (BTC) by default anymore but Segwit2x coin is suddenly your bitcoin if a split occurs, just say it. It's not a shame (well actually it is) but the user wants to know that explicitly! One can then draw conclusions from that and move on.

Ledger supports BIP44 HD wallets. Every time a transaction is done it "creates" a new recieving address. Nevertheless you can also recieve funds on "old" addresses but that's considered less secure. Addresses will BTW never be deleted since they're derived from your seed.

It's so "hard" to get them because once you got them, they are truly yours and can't be taken away from you as easy as anything else. Then, transferring them is completely without 3rd party, thus trustless. But getting them needs some trust: Some exchange follow KYC and AML, those need your personal information. You have to trust them, not to give it away. You have to trust your bank to send money to an exchange, have to trust the exchange not to be scam, have to trust your exchange to be perfectly secure, have to trust your exchange to let you withdraw to your "own" wallet. You have to trust your wallet not to be a scam, so choose an open source one but once you got your coins in your (trusted) wallet, those are yours for sure and you invested in your freedom of your future.

Ah, okay. You still don't own bitcoin? I'd always care about having some in case you could need them. For a one time transfer you could be correct. It depends on your location, the amount of money to be send and the service you use to transfer the money. Even with the exchange fee there is the chance that sending through bitcoin is cheaper.
@_date: 2017-01-25 13:17:20
There is no way to force miners supporting segwit. Also is forcing sb. to do something not the way bitcoin works. Bitcoin works in a democratic way, where everybody is free to decide on one's own what to do and what not to. Even if a missing segwit activation was very regrettable, we'd have to accept that and perhaps rethink the whole discussion to find a compromise. That's how bitcoin works.

Not true. It stays deflationary. Let's assume we add another digit so that smallest unit is worth 0.1 Satoshi. Let's call it Nano.

Nevertheless. As long as *we people* exit well before the rats do, we very likely will *take the power back* and end this monetary tyranny.

It's all about the most important thing in bitcoin: decentralization. Small blocks mean less hardware requirements on running a full node, means node network can expand. Once segwit activates (about 200 blocks to go) and lightning's running (very soon, some implementations are already waiting) we'll see faster transactions and reduced fees.

It's very unlikely the fork happens. But if does, there will be methods of getting in control of the new altcoin (2xcoin) just like it was the case with bch.

@_date: 2017-08-21 06:56:15
Tell people the truth. The truth is there's only one developer creating the code for segwit2x. That's Jeff Garzik who works for BitPay for several years already. BitPay is puppet of Bitmain and Jihan Wu. Or was it the other way around? Who cares. Anyway,  those two or three guys wish to take over control of bitcoin. So they fooled some companies to get on board and settled the [NYA]( Most of those companies probably don't even understand what they signed for and will certainly pull back. However many others though [(NOB2X)]( seem to have already stated their disregards concerning SegWit2x and won't participate. That's it.
Edit: One word about my "propaganda": Research yourself and validate that it's true. **Intentionally not adding replay protection within the 2X-code is the hostility itself** and made me being that straight and direct.  
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:01:56
Ok. I get you too. But I don't believe miners will do that as quick money is too valuable. And I can only imagine one big miner having such hashpower but as he stated he will not support that fork but plans to be on the segwit2x path. Nevertheless abite a damn slow network until difficulty change (14 days max), nothing harmful would happen...
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:19:07

This fee is calculated for a 226 byte sized transaction (which depends on the amount of inputs and outputs the transaction is about), how big was your tx?
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:43:53
Just send your btc postfork to a new address you control. If the forked coin also moves, there was a replay attack but you are still in control of both coins (since you also own the new private key on both chains) and just repeat until forked coin doesn't move anymore. Then everything is fine and you don't have to do anything more about it. You can then do business as usual with both coins, your btc and the new altcoin.

But if bch difficulty now rises 300% in about 6 hours; how long will it take to bring it down again if the steps are -20% after (every) 12 hours. At least 2 to 3 days? Segwit will have been activated by then.

The problem is a bit of far-fetched, isn't it? Whom do you think will the wallets follow? A network which has just a few nodes and thus nearly no users? I don't think so. Also, if medium.com is going on to spread such fud, I don't see it being recommendable anymore.
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:18:05
The hardware wallet manages your private keys in a secure way. Those keys will never leave your device (unless you want it to). A flash drive or similar is easily hackable when plugged into device with internet access. Thus a specialized hardware wallet is way more secure than any of those self-experiments (unless you know exactly what you're doing). I highly recommend you to follow my advice. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 22:50:04

@_date: 2016-12-15 12:00:25
I think you don't understand. The distribution of mined blocks depend on the provided hashrate and the order does not matter. The users will have to pay more fees for a certain time (until the mempool is emptier again). The resulting profit is "shared" by the miners. Imagine: All miners would mine empty blocks for one hour. 6 empty blocks are about 12000 tx. You need about 6 more hours to decrease the mempool again (plus the new tx coming in). But these six blocks will have higher fee profit, no matter who mines them (because users want their tx to go through quickly, and wallets' automated fee calculation will also set higher fees).
@_date: 2017-08-13 10:57:43
I'd tell him to also just buy one while it's still that cheap.
@_date: 2017-08-22 11:44:45
I don't think it's drama. It's just a request for stance. In case of replay or wipeout attack, it won't get that easy to split/recover/gain access to the holdings, if you're not an advanced user, even if you hold the private keys.
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:29:44

The screenshot was probably fake and you got scammed. I am using mycelium for years and never had any serious issues which couldn't have been solved.

@_date: 2019-08-29 16:35:12
Is it that risky to leave your key in front of the door to your house for a few days? How long could you leave it there? Dunno.  
  
I by myself always transfer my funds to my own wallet immediately after purchasing them. Because I don't like the idea of **hacks, confiscations or exit scams** nor supporting the idea of **crypto banks**. That's exactly what bitcoin wants to get rid of.
Edit: Formating.
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:48:35
Doesn't that solve the problem? Wallets can make use of it  
@_date: 2019-08-14 19:34:58
The price is relevant for the security of the network. The higher the price the higher is the expected hashrate which miners invest to get their part of the cake. With rising hashrate successfully accomplishing a 51% attacks becomes more and more unlikely (if they aren't already practically impossible anyway) That's the only reason why price matters. 
The rest is just about how many Satoshis you control.
@_date: 2019-08-10 12:40:24
The best thing is to setup an own BTCPay Server ( preferably on a dedicated server under exclusive control.
It's open source and you don't pay third party fees. One of the best bitcoin projects ever. There are tutorials outthere in case the information given on the website isn't enough for you.
It's really worth getting into it since it gives you exclusive control over the funds coming in thus following one of bitcoin main principles namely *minimization of trust*.

If it's really like that: okay. More than 40% (and counting) of all nodes have changed to segwit, (0.13.1/0.13.99). If Chinese miners wouldn't change, I BET THERE ARE ENOUGH OTHER MINERS WHO WILL DO and only they will finally profit. Bye bye, Chinese miners.

Right now you can send *any* amount of bitcoin *anywhere* in the world for less than 1 dollar, completely settled within one hour at the latest. If that is not convincing enough, I don't know what else I could tell you.

I think the problem is that OP might think he could add the passphrase after his seed is already in use/has funds. But that's not possible of course. As soon as the 25th word is added the seed is completely new and there are no funds in it at all.
@_date: 2019-08-29 15:13:04
Don't worry. It will go through. Most nodes are set to 14 days until they clear out their mempool and that's when you will have access to your coins again *at the latest*.
Apart of that depending on the wallet you are using you can use CPFP or RBF to bump your trx or... google 'transaction accelerator'.

The biggest contra is, if you want to directly recover the seed on the device, that takes a while cause it's a bit tricky doing it with these hardware buttons. But all in all it's a super device. The biggest pro is that you just need the device to perform transactions while needing also the security card on older ledger versions (hw1/nano).

Reasonable consideration. I fully agree! Those who doubt bitcoin being a store of value should try changing their perspective, foremost away from this *soon^tm* worthless fiat.

Don't waste your time with those 'predictions'. Bitcoin will do what it does, nobody can predict it. Those who tell you it drops are out, those telling you it'll rise are in. Nothing of importance.
Given bitcoin's tremendous scarcity along with the exorbitant hashpower it's very likely bitcoin will go on seeking new aths at least until it sees 500kish levels, being rendered into an asset which is to take very serious. But that's just my opinion.

So imagine there were just 500 fullnodes running, instead of currently 65,000. To crap the whole network up it would just take another 501 malicious fullnodes and 1 malicious miner, right? So imho OP is completely correct. By setting up a fullnode you support decentralization and with it the security of the whole network.
But then again you're also correct. Setting up a fullnode means caring for oneself in the first place.
Nevertheless, if you care for yourself by setting up a fullnode you also care for bitcoin as a whole.

Well. I am quite bullish on bitcoin long-term. 10 years from now we will laugh about these ridiculous $10k levels. As well as about $100k levels. While McAfee's prediction for bitcoin to hit $1m at the end of 2020 is quite certainly wrong, imho it'll very certainly be right ten years from now. Bitcoin is ridiculously tiny compared to some other money respectively asset markets:
$9 trillion annual market for electronic payments
$24 trillion annual e-commerce market
$574 billion annual remittance market
$2.3 trillion hedge fund market
$7 trillion gold market
$4.5 trillion cash market
$16.7 trillion offshore deposit market
$90 trillion global monetary base 
Bitcoin: **just about $155 billion.**
  
So if bitcoin at least  is sufficient for you to retire ten years from now, well imho that'll be it.

Just buy bitcoin on regular basis (dca).
 Most people trying to time the market and trade bitcoin end up with less funds than they started with! Just buying and hodling has almost always turned out to be the better decision for most of us and is foremost a very efficient method resulting in more profit for less effort. Trading bitcoin is only for professionals.

For wallets that are compatible meaning they use the same HD wallet standard (which mostly is BIP39), it should work. Afaik Bread uses an own method of creating seeds/keys and with Electrum I think you can choose BIP39 for wallet creation. Trezor and Ledger for example are BIP39 compatible.


Cross-Check: Yes. Definitely test the thing out with some small funds first. After making sure it works like expected, create your actual seed you wanna go with.


Xpub is the public master key. It contains the public keys (and thus addresses) to all regarding private keys which are basically derived from your seed.
As I said: Always test out you prefered setup environment *before* actually using it in 'real life'.
@_date: 2016-12-27 17:01:11
Probably the sender resent the tx (since realizing, the fee was too less, thus it's now a potential double spent). Now it's a higher fee and the tx size is also less. Should go through soon! The tx size depends on the amount of involved addresses (inputs/outputs). The more addresses are involved, the bigger the tx size is. Mostly auto-calculated fees work well; but sometimes they don't.

I suggest you look into Electrum (for desktop). Its cold wallet feature is damn secure if you ask me, if done right.
  
It takes a some more effort to set it up, but imho if you do it correctly it's more secure than a hardwarewallet, where you have to trust the company behind it to not have backdoors implemented.  
**But be sure to only download from  and verify the pgp signatures before using it!**  
  
I recently tested the cold storage feature myself and I have to say: It's great!
It's essential the OS you use on the 'cold side' never went online nor it will ever be online!
So here are the measurements I took to have a complete offline machine:
- installed a completely fresh OS on a bootable USB drive
- took an old notebook, went into BIOS and deactivated any network related devices such as network adapter, wifi and bluetooth (edit: if possible dismount the hardware components from the machine completely)
- additionally switched off the wifi hardware button on the notebook, just to be sure
- booted from prepared USB drive (see above) finished the OS setup process
- uninstalled any network regarding driver
- checked that there aren't any online connections, just to be sure
- setup (pgp-verified) electrum version I transfered to the machine via USB
That's it. Imho doing it that way is damn secure. But all in all it's quite easy, at least easier than glacier protocol but it has a very similar outcome.

That's not his bitcoin works anyway. No one connects directly to a miner to pass a trx to him. New trxs are broadcasted into the network of about 60,000 fullnodes where miners are part of.

I think changelly is a service to avoid. Different users reported that after sending funds to be swapped they were suddenly demanded to provide personal data. Changelly says this happens if a trx/swap gets flagged 'suspicious'. If you deny providing your data your funds are lost. Be careful. You never know...
@_date: 2019-08-29 15:25:40


Yes. Until it gets processed or 'returned'. Unless your trx gets repropagated by another node and the given time frame resets.
That's why anyone should at least dive a bit deeper into 'setting the ideal trx fee' and try to understand 'how bitcoin fees work'. Setting it manually by using the mentioned site above always brings the best results, at least for me.

You should post this article in shitcoin sub as it brilliantly shows why having 2 Gbyte blocks won't solve the scaling issue. Thanks for posting but for bitcoin itself it's pretty unrelated. Bitcoin chose to scale by quality, not by quantity. Even Hal Finney was talking avout 2nd layer scaling and it's likely he and also Satoshi did the calculations mentioned in the article themselves.

Setup electrum with the regarding address as watch-only wallet on a second (online) machine. Create the *unsigned* transaction there, export as file, onto usb, move it to your offline machine and load it in electrum. Sign the trx offline, export the *signed* trx onto your usb, import it into your watch-only electrum and broadcast the trx from there. Done in an ultra secure manner.

All those derivates are just laughable. Bitcoin is limited to 21 million coins. All of them are easily verifiable by querying the blockchain. Any others asset is manipulateable way more simple because no one can verify the (pretended) fundamentals on one's own.

At least one malicious miner is sufficient to split the chain. Then it's not a question of 'if' but 'when', depending on its hashrate.
And if the new chain is backed by plenty of nodes, well... I wouldn't like to see this scenario. Above all since any of both sides will declare the other one malicious and will claim that their own chain is the original bitcoin blockchain. So one could argue that the side backed by (way) more nodes may not be the malicious one, in case the nakamoto consensus doesn't give an unambiguous result in times when dust won't have settled yet.

Edit: I once, just out of fun, did some related maths: 
**To store all possible (pregenerated) private keys on 1 TB micro sd cards you would need about 43 billion times the volume of our solar system.**
Even only one time the volume of our solar system would mean billions and trillions of pre-generated keys. But not even one of them would actually hold any funds.

Why Bitcoin? Well: Bitcoin has got some advantages others lack of, as I've pointed out earlier. Think of it:
- Bitcoin is exclusively leaderless, there is no sole entity deciding on bitcoin's fate beside the whole bitcoin economy and community by participating within the network's consensus rules.
- Bitcoin has a tremendous network effect which cannot be successful competed against due to first mover advantage
- Bitcoin has the highest amount of fullnodes running all around the world (about 65.000 at the time of writing) which renders bitcoin the most decentralized crypto (likely ever) in existence.
- Meanwhile bitcoin's mining distribution has also increased to healthy levels whereas its hashrate is the highest within the crypto space
- Bitcoin has a outstanding development team consisting of hundreds of very smart people all around the world
- Bitcoin has the leading support within companies, politics and the community as a whole
- Bitcoin's second layer solution lightning network which is built on the most secure blockchain in existence is able to process transactions blazing fast. Especially the aspect of having a totally secure first layer and a lightning fast second layer is the most genius step bitcoin could have taken.
In my view all this can hardly be beaten by any shitcoin (any other alt as well as all the results of forking/splitting the original chain).
All those shitcoins are just stupid pump and dump getting rich quick schemes which will finally die out when more use cases are built on top of bitcoin's blockchain. Surely it will still take some time but time is on bitcoin's side.
@_date: 2019-08-19 10:32:29
Exactly my opinion. Last time when there was a bigger tether issue, bitcoin didn't react the slightest to it (tether dropped some months ago about 10% or so because of bitfinex/tether fraud claims and so forth). Apart of that some claim to have figured out, that when new tethers were 'printed' and tether got inflated some times in the past, bitcoin reacted with price rises after some days to weeks. But I really don't think it's correlated. Imho the whole thing is fud and designed to fear people out of bitcoin or at least make them not get in. But that's just my opinion.

Inflation (fresh bitcoin supply) right rate now: about 3.75% p. a.
From:  
2020 - 1.85%  
2024 - 0.9%  
2028 - 0.45%  
2032 - 0.23%  
2036 - 0.12%  
...and so on and on.  
So roughly within the next 16 years we see bitcoin at an inflation (fresh bitcoin supply) of just 1/30 of the recent rate of 3.75% p.a. Imho these are amazing values which reflect well the progress of bitcoin being deflationary and becoming increasingly scarce.

First, nobody can say how this situation is with gold. And that's exactly why bitcoin is better. Everything is verifiable by oneself. Second, sure there are some dozen of whales, foremost the earliest early adopters (which by the way took the highest risk when investing in BTC) with shitloads of coins. But I am quite sure they will never give up their excellent position within the space. They know (and have known for quite a long time) that bitcoin is the future of money and it would be really stupid to change back their stack into shitty dying fiat.

For iphone i would temporarily use BRD Wallet. Changelly.com let's you purchase via Mater or Visa. Never tried it like this but used their service a few times to swap some crypto which always worked flawlessly.
So in short:
Install BRD Wallet Wallet, click on recieve. Write down your Bitcoin address (or just copy it to clipboard if you know your mobile is clean of malware). Head over to changelly.com, click 'Buy crypto with bankcard' and follow the instructions. When asked for a bitcoin address put in the one from BRD you wrote down earlier. Never did it myself but that way it should work.
For iPhone it mid/long term might make sense to get a Ledger Nano X as hardware wallet. You can control it via secure Bluetooth connection and their mobile ledger live app for Android or iPhone.

What do you expect? Bitcoin is still tiny and if supply doesn't meet demand some little bigger portions of dollars move market enormously. Normal thing.
$9 trillion annual market for electronic payments
$24 trillion annual e-commerce market
$574 billion annual remittance market
$2.3 trillion hedge fund market
$7 trillion gold market
$4.5 trillion cash market
$16.7 trillion offshore deposit market
$90 trillion global monetary base 
**Bitcoin: just about $170 billion.**

The fuller the mempool (with its not yet processed transactions) is, the slower the tx go through/will be processed. The faster you want your tx to go into blockchain, the higher your tx fee must be. Higher fees mean (for all future tx) more profit for the miners.

Sorry for you to hear you didn't already get that bitcoin and blockchain is one and the same thing. Any other blockchain is only a joke, a cheap copy of bitcoin technology but without any real security and easily attackble, most likely even private, centralized and/or without true censorship-resistance.
Even long-term big money, in the first place various funds have already got what bitcoin is about. And they don't have the intention to trade it but to hold it as a store of value with enormous potential (it's only 1-1.5% of gold marketcap, btw) Trade, as long as you can because one day, when bitcoin is beginning to reach first levels of saturation, in my view around 300k to 500k per BTC, the volatility will begin decreasing to lowest amplitude, it will likely be quite boring to trade bitcoin. When this state is reached bitcoin (for high amount money transfers) and lightning (for daily spending) will be established payment systems with the majority of enterprises accepting it and majority of employers paying it as well as most folks wanting it.
I think the number of people realizing the advantages of bitcoin is rising although sometimes the are some who cannot get behind bitcoin as their view is too narrow-minded. But that's okay. Some sooner, some later.
Disclaimer: Majority of people shouldn't try to trade bitcoin. History shows this majority often experiencing trading losses while just a few pro traders frequently squeeze those weakhands and take away their stack. If people would be smart and just buy and hodl/spend/replace but not sell they would very likely end up with more funds since not having lost the half of it in between.

No, sorry. I will repeat it until every newcomer knows that you simply don't buy any real bitcoins there. Real bitcoins are those you can withdraw and take complete control over using an own wallet (hardware wallet at best). Real bitcoins are those which can be proven valid on the blockchain by signing addresses with the belonging private key. There will ever only be 21 million *valid* bitcoins and I am proud to own a *real* fraction of those. Buying bitcoin at Robinhood or eToro is simply buying bullshit, even without really owning it.

Reusing addresses is not recommended in general. You make yourself vulnerable to quantum computing attacks once those devices come into existence. But one has to differentiate: You can reuse addresses for multiple recievings securely, as this way you don't reveal your public key (which would be needed for quantum attacks to be successful). But once you start spending from the wallet you should completely abandon the address by moving the remaining funds to a fresh one.
Tl;dr: Address reuse for multiple recievings secure. Multiple recievings **and spendings** makes you vulnerable to quantum computing attacks and you could possibly lose your funds.

Your bitcoin isn't lost forever. Just be more patient. Next time move your funds to an own wallet after purchasing them and don't store them on exchanges longer than needed.
When you want to sell some, move them to the appropriate exchange while setting your desired trx fee. This way you won't have to wait that long because you're in control of how long it takes until the trx is processed.

(ANVANCED USERS ONLY!)
If you want to generate a damn secure seed without having to rely on ledger's or trezor's RNG (random number generator), do the following.
   
   
Head to  and just save the website onto a usb drive for offline usage.
Download and burn any linux live system onto another USB drive or CD, I use Ubuntu live system.
Unplug network cable and shut down your router!
Boot the live linux system, plug in USB drive with downloaded Ian-Coleman Website and open it with any webrowser
Tick Show entropy details after that choose desired seed length below Mnemonic length (I always generate 24 word seeds)
Throw a dice one hundred times and enter each throw in the belonging textbox.
Copy your created seed carefully by writing in down and safe it securely, at best not in digital form.
Copy the first bitcoin address shown below for validation purposes later on.
Shutdown Linux, remove USB drives/CD.
Start your desired wallet (that supports 24 word seed) and choose restore wallet instead of creating a new one.
Enter your fresh 24 seed words. If that works and there's no error message, you can be sure to have generated a valid seed. Verify that the first receiving address matches the one written down a few step above. If they match you're fine.
Done. You now have a seed that is damn secure as it doesn't rely on any RNG (random number generator) but got its entropy from a truely random process, just by throwing a dice.
ONLY USE THIS METHOD IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING. MISTAKES CAN LEAD TO LOSS OF FUNDS FOR WHICH I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE

The thing is there is no crypto being decentralized and secure except bitcoin. Some other shitcoins were already successfully 51%-attacked which *does* render them insecure in general.

The only possible solution to storing wealth securely and without having to fear losses is using a medium that *is* deflationary, meaning no one can control a set in stone maximum supply. That's what bitcoin is all about and the reason why everbody is loving it. There will never be more than 21 million bitcoin and this certainty is simply calming.
@_date: 2019-10-30 09:56:46
If you use custodial wallets or store bitcoin on exchanges it actually *can* happen because you are **not** in control of the keys. As for electrum (respectively other non-custodial open source wallets) it's simply not possible to steal your coins since (as for electrum) the software is open source meaning it is reviewed very well and it's made sure there aren't any backdoors implemented making stealing coins possible.  
Thus one should never use custodial wallets, store funds on exchanges longer than needed and always store funds within well reviewed open source wallets.

Stop crying, Roger. There's only one real *peer-to-peer* electronic cash system, and that from technical perspective is lightning. You should take a deeper look into your understanding of p2p. Essentially *any* blockchain based crypto with a mempool involved out of which 'miners' choose to process desired trx is *not* peer-to-peer, until it is by adding *true p2p* capabilities like lightning did. Your altcoin will eventually die, no matter how big your blocks are or how often you cry about it here. Instead of becoming bitcoin's enemy you better should have respected the majority consensus of not scaling on chain to keep decentralization as much as possible. And further *together* improve second layer solutions as part of bitcoin. But you chose not to and forked off. And now that's *your* problem, not ours.
I suggest you to personally contact theymos or whoever and ask them directly about what happened to your postings instead of expressing certainly meaningless concerns.

Why? This time it's the institutional investors who drive the price. Most of them are various funds who rather invest long term and don't intend to trade their holdings. It's the big money from the sidelines everybody was talking about the last two years. The traders usually causing the drops will become increasingly meaningless in the future. Their amount of funds isn't sufficient to compete with the new big long term hodlers who will drive the price upwards in a phased way. 
I still don't have any doubt that bitcoin will do the s-curve in terms of adoption and value and we're still at the early beginning of a parabolic move which nevertheless eventually reaches a certain saturation level where exponential growth slows down as well as volatility. At that time major key holders like governments and banks will have a significant share in bitcoin which then likey renders into being the new world reserve currency.

Clever, clever. Better pack your things together and hire at any crypto business start-up. Could be a life-saving decision.


Old Jamie. You have changed so much... 


There aren't. It's just that a new gold-standard, which is bitcoin, introduced itself, clearing up the 'house of debts' once and for all. It's ends the period of modern slavery as we know it by being sound money which also cannot have negative balance on which somebody else enriches himself.


KYC in the end will not be sustainable. Decentralized exchanges are gaining traction and those will eventually very likey replace any centralized exchanges. (Open sourced) code simply works better than any company, solely its promotion is often worse. But privacy and sovereignty is demanded more and more everywhere these days, that it'll eventually not be achievable to completely observe nor control the whole sphere *especially not* open, distributed consensus based code.


Ah that's sweet. Come into bitcoin and worship its potential. It'll be rewarding. Otherwise you will lose in the end.

If 'stronger' also means 'more secure' then sorry, but you're wrong. There is an undeniable relationship between bitcoin price and security of the network. The higher the price the higher the miners' incentive to increase hashrate. The higher the hashrate the more the secure network, the lower the likelihood of somebody successfully attacking the chain.

Fee estimation algorithms are problematic in general, they are not very good at predicting the future and rely on time bases of the past (often 24 hours). The best is to have a look at this great site and decide for yourself which fee to choose.

The tools trezor and ledger provided, are working (I haven't read anything else). In case of ledger, the tool creates a new set of addreses on a different derivation path but below the same seed (kind of new account). In case of trezor, I don't know how the did the trick, likely similar. The only problem is, if you (from whatever reason, *do that only in case of emergency!*) have to import your seed into another wallet, make sure to choose one with editable derivation path or you won't have access to your split bch.
Those 'accounts', you asked for, are generated within the same seed.

The problem is that people really think paypal is money. But it's not. Thus it's never recommended to do bitcoin-paypal trades. If you want real bitcoin then purchase it with "real" fiat money. At least until it still exists. And don't confuse 'exchange' and 'wallet'.

Even fiat currency is a big experiment. It failed many different times (but still not completely) and fucked the majority of people throughout dozens of decades. But yet it's there. - Now there's bitcoin. I am excited of the next hyperinflation coming, along with the devaluation of the dollar (by some of the mightiest countries, which own *a lot of dollars in reserve*). Once they have enough of US dominating the rest of the world, they will prove bitcoin right. It's just a matter of time, remember my words.

Depends: If you're a common user and average tech savvy get a hardware wallet. It's quite secure and easy to use. If you're an advanced user and know what you are doing then Electrum setup as cold storage is a great solution.
If you want to look into Electrum (for desktop), this is the way I did it. Its cold wallet feature is damn secure if you ask me, if done right.
  
It takes a some more effort to set it up, but imho if you do it correctly it's more secure than a hardwarewallet, where you have to trust the company behind it to not have backdoors implemented.  
**But be sure to only download from  and verify the pgp signatures before using it!**  
  
I recently tested the cold storage feature myself and I have to say: It's great!
It's essential the OS you use on the 'cold side' never went online nor it will ever be online!
So here are the measurements I took to have a complete offline machine:
- installed a completely fresh OS on a bootable USB drive
- took an old notebook, went into BIOS and deactivated any network related devices such as network adapter, wifi and bluetooth (edit: if possible dismount the hardware components from the machine completely)
- additionally switched off the wifi hardware button on the notebook, just to be sure
- booted from prepared USB drive (see above) finished the OS setup process
- uninstalled any network regarding driver
- checked that there aren't any online connections, just to be sure
- setup (pgp-verified) electrum version I transfered to the machine via USB
That's it. Imho doing it that way is damn secure. But all in all it's relatively easy, at least easier than glacier protocol but it has a very similar outcome.

Paperwallets are not recommended anymore unless you are an advanced user. There are too much things you could do wrong and run into issues. Just use an open source wallet for mobile or desktop (electrum, mycelium, green wallet, samourai and many more). Best is using a hardware wallet like ledger or trezor.

I am sure the SEC will investigate there, before approving the solidx etf. If it would turn out to be true (which will be provable in some way), I am sure the SEC won't like such stuff and would put any measures against such manipulative and fraudent methods. But in my view it's anyway just fud.

You can take normal paper. The more enduring it is, the better it is. You can also laminate it, since it's very endurable then. Plus I wouldn't take a WiFi connected printer but one which is connected through a wire only. And think of generating the addresses in a secure way, offline and e. g. with the bitaddress org code, downloadable at githubs.

Right now you can send *any* amount of bitcoin for about $2 quite quicky (likely within 10 to 20 minutes). Or you choose 50ct which likey takes about 3 hours to be settled. Decide for yourself whether it's worth it.

You are safe using the ledger wallet. Just don't move your coins around time of fork and wait for ledger team to supply coinsplit tool. They already announced they'd do so.

Wallets don't offer replay protection. If at all they provide tools to help you splitting your coins. Trezor and ledger announced to do so. Also wait for bread to update their blogpost, as they implied to do so as well.
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:36:31
If you do the math, then do it correctly: 144 blocks/day * 0.4 (40%) = 57 blocks/day. Also difficulty adjustment perdiod (actually average 14 days) is 14/0.4 (40%) that's 35 days until next adjustment (if miners left instantly after adjustment).
So: 57 blocks / day (not 6), adjustment after 5 weekss (not months).
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:23:31
They won't change their minds. Because spending ≠ selling.
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:47:28
Since difficulty is likely to decrease, it becomes more profitable to mine it. Thus transaction backlog will also decrease faster, bitcoin transactions to be cheaper and faster again. Bch attacks obviously don't work. I expect to see rising prices.

Sorry, but you're talking absolute bullshit.
Those who are in very very long certainly don't wait to rechange their stack into fiat money. They are not stupid. Fiat money is dying and they already knew that when taking the 'risk' of appreciating bitcoin years ago. They have excellent positions in the space which makes the future of money and they are aware of it. Most of them will never sell for shitty dying fiat, even not them when BTC is valued around 1m. Fiat is dead.

The next difficulty adjustment will be at block 493516. Until block of fork (494784) there will already 863 be mined from the amount of 2016 blocks. So there are just 1153 block to be mined. That's 57%. 
Normal adjustment takes about 14 days. Worst case scenario is 20% hashrate will remain BTC (Slush/F2Pool/some smaller), then whole difficulty period would be 5 times longer, 70 days. Remaining blocks to be mined is only 57%, that's 40 days. So worst case, bitcoin is very expensive to use within 40 days to next adjustment. With the beginning of the following difficulty period, price would skyrocket like there's no tomorrow.

In my opinion bitcoin will form an S-curve in bigger picture. And I see us at the point of increasing acceleration into an almost vertical rise (not sure when that will be and how long that will continue). Once it may reach levels of decreasing acceleration, in the end I see it transforms into an almost horizontal line with minimal volatility. So yes, I think nowadays, one can still call oneself an 'early adopter'. But that's just *my* vision... 
@_date: 2019-06-28 15:32:54
Space on the one and only real blockchain is rare and costly. You choose: Insecure and vulnerable but cheap and fast. Or secure and rocksolid but expensive and slow. I prefer the latter. With Lightning adoption increasing we will have both: Ultra-secure but lightning-fast. Until then don't use 'Gold' to purchase your everyday coffee. Do important transactions with increased fee or when mempools are empty.
@_date: 2019-06-29 04:11:21
Yeah. But people don't get it and rather panic sell. Bitcoin is made for the strongest hands only. Anybody else except very few pro traders bite the dust. They cannot handle being in non-profit zones for too long and rather settle their 'losses' by (buying high and) selling cheap. Noob mistake. Buying, accumulating, hodling and some lessons about staying calm and patient always turn out to be less stressful and more profitable.

Exchanges manage token market off chain. Only transfers to or from exchange are on-chain. Has nothing to do with the mempool. Mempool itself is clearing slowly at the moment, but it is. Most likely it still gets spammed by some bitcoin opponents (Roger Ver, Jihan Wu, fake satoshi Wright, John McAfee), which would rather see their *altcoin* being bitcoin. Once they realize it's just an expensive waste of money, they'll stop it.

At least 20% hashrate will go on mining BTC (F2Pool, Slush and some others) so difficulty adjustment can take *maximum* 5 times longer than it takes in general. Also, I don't see NYA miners really mining at such a big loss, since segwit2x altcoin will be wortless thus not be profitable to mine at all. So *years* is certainly not gonna happen. Worst case would be *weeks* in my view, best case is, the split is not going to happen at all. We'll see.

No. As far as I know, bitcoin is *deflating* while fiat is *inflating*.

It depends on whether you want to trade bitcoin (and likely lose money) or you want to *really* get your hands on it (buying, owning, transfering, storing, hodling, spending, exchanging... ).
If it's the latter then buy some amount of bitcoin on a reputable exchange and get a hardware wallet like ledger or trezor to store your funds securely.

What do you want to tell us? That you're planning to invest in AI to get rich quick?
This sub isn't about getting rich quick. It's about bitcoin, the hardest and soundest money ever created. You don't want to *invest* in bitcoin. You want to *switch* to bitcoin and abandon the current fraudent monetary system. Bitcoin is making you rich not because you will have multiplied your shitty dollars in the end but because for the first time you have true sound money in your hand which is completely under your own control. No capital controls, no confiscations, no synthetic devaluations. Bitcoin is priceless and not comparable to any other form of 'investment'.
Even though AI could be a territory worth researching more, you are wrong if you think you'll find people here willing to invest in such. As I said: Bitcoin is not about investing; it's getting rid of shitty dollars for *real* money.

Okay. I think you would send BTC to one of supporting exchanges. They would then split your BTC in two different tokens of which you can sell/buy the one or the other. Those can then be converted back into BTC, B2X or whatever. I think that's how it works.

Based on [this research paper from 2019]( bitcoin can achieve a theoretical maximum throughput of 27 tps. The rest is maths:
5,000,000,000 div 27 div 60 div 60 div 24 div 365 = ~ 6 years (if we take the current blocksize with no increase).
Some would argue bitcoin's max throughput in reality is just about 7 tps. Fine. Replace the '27' with it and you get about 22.5 years.
So ~6 years respectively ~22.5 years or something in between to let 5 billion people open a channel if all of the transactions are dedicated to opening lightning channels and there's no blocksize increase or any other meaningful scaling attempt.
That's it.

Bitcoin is all about *removing* the need of trust. Why should I trust an unknown node to accomplish my transactions? That'd be quite silly because that's exactly what bitcoin tries to avoid: Needing to trust a third party. And even if there's no known case of someone losing his funds that way: There's always a first time.

The title is a bit misleading. True adoption will be brought by those who really need bitcoin because of a weak monetary system or economical situation, which is mainly the South American and African states, sooner or later also the rest of the world because of ongoing frauds within our banking industry. **The linked source rather explains the bitcoin hype cycle and why it's inevitable bitcoin will again and again find itself to boldly go where no man has gone before...**

The miners follow the market. So if they think they need to move the miners, they have to move the market. Obviously that mission failed once. And it will fail twice and on because the problem with bitcoin cash is, that one day it will be completely centralized. That's because of their 8 times bigger max blocksize. Only nodes with way bigger hardware setup will be able to function as a fullnode and the bigger the blocks get the more will the amount of fullnodes decrease, until there are still just a few, which makes the network pretty easy attackable. Furthermore they don't even have good future upgrade capabilities, as segwit was completely denied and not implemented, which would have been the base for further easy potential improvements. So in the end such a coin is completely worthless.

Pre-generating addresses/keys really makes absolutely no sense. The likelyhood of someone generating an address which was ever used or even held funds is... Zero. At least almost. You would spend hundreds of millions of years to be successful.
Or let me put it another way: Once I did some maths: To store all possible (pregenerated) private keys on 1 TB micro sd cards you would need about 43 billion times the volume of our solar system.
Even only one time the volume of our solar system would mean billions and trillions of pre-generated keys. But not even one of them would actually hold any funds.

In the beginning it was just a joke or a stupid game if you want. I remember the days when as a kid I traded 1 colourful marble against 2 usual marbels. I definitely wanted to have this colourful one and my friend agreed to take the two usual ones as exchange. In the early days, miners minted the coins for fun. Imagine the one had minted 10,000 bitcoin but the other one only had 2,000 bitcoin. So he said to the first one: Come on, gimme 3,000 of your coins, I give you a dollar for it, deal? So they made the deal. And suddenly a bitcoin was worth 0.03 cents. The values are just for illustration, but I think you get it, right?

If you really doubt this simple fact, I'd suggest you to either

If you're going to trust a third party on keeping your bitcoins, then it's **not your bitcoins!** Remember? "Not your keys, not your coins!"
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:11:49
Obviously you don't understand my analogy. If the last bitcoin is mined, miners just mine for fees. If nobody does transactions, there won't be any fees. Hmm. So what do you think?
@_date: 2019-06-29 12:27:49
It's a pump and dump. Pull back into bitcoin quickly or experience losses in short term.
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:21:15
You mean like this guy? 
@_date: 2015-08-24 17:01:55
No. But it's an imaginable scenario. In fact, bitcoinwisdom.com shows the contrary...
@_date: 2015-08-24 22:44:20
You can study what you want but the only remaining question is: Do you believe in bitcoin or not? That's the base on which your actions take place.

If you are serious on that question, then... Buy bitcoin. Very likely you won't regret it.

Yep. As much as I appreciate the work of the core devs. But Segwit not yet implemented into *the* bitcoin fullnode software wallet, with all those fights regarding and finally activated segwit, is simply not okay.

@_date: 2015-08-03 07:47:17
My opinion is, Satoshi still has access to his coins. If something goes wrong and the value of bitcoin would fall cause somebody wants the price to extremely drop, he would burn those coins officially, to make clear there's now a lot less to have. That would make the value rise'n'rise and give hope for the future.

Next Proof-of-keys day is on January, 3rd 2020. That's in just about one month.
A lot of people will move their coins off any 3rd parties like exchanges or custodial wallets on that date to prove the true ownership of their coins.
This will result in slightly higher on chain fees for some hours and days, of course. Those who are smart begin moving their coins off some days to weeks earlier, at best already today.
The smartest never store their funds with 3rd parties longer than needed but are *always* in control of their own funds. **Always store your funds in a wallet, where you exclusively are in control of the keys!** This way you don't have to fear to lose funds due to hacks, confiscations, capital controls, hair cuts or exit scams.

Crap. It's just the miners, thinking that by signaling "NYA" they have any influence. In the end majority of nodes will decide on validity of mined blocks.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:39:19
Once bitcoin cash blocks are full (8Mbyte), the network will be centralized due to drastical hardware and bandwidth requirements for running a fullnode, so less and less people will do so. Such network is pretty easy attackable. That means it's not secure and you might lose your funds.
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:58:27
Correct. There are about 40 million millionaires all over the world but there will ever only be 21 million bitcoins.

Both are to avoid! But to be serious: Robinhood is still less recommended than CB. You don't own actual bitcoin there which you could withdraw. In fact you're buying fake bitcoin, which are not even under your control... Lol.

The more the mass adopts bitcoin, the more the price will stabilize. A raising capitalisation (while constant or slower raising transaction volume) leads to less volatile price.
@_date: 2019-04-05 21:39:15


The wasn't my point. 
@_date: 2019-12-31 13:59:54
Segwit usage is just about 60%. With increasing usage we will finally see at least 7 tps, likely even more. On top of that Taproot and Schnorr when implemented (btw possible just by soft forking) will improve both, privacy and scalability. There are other scaling options in place and talked about and I am hopeful scalability and adoption both will increase linearly eventually with no lack in one or the other.
@_date: 2019-12-21 19:50:58

Doing it this way means you officially owned some bitcoin once in a while. No matter if you use monero or whatever to clean your coins, you'll eventually have to have a good answer where you're coins are gone!
Purchasing through ATM anonymously means *no one could ever know you owned bitcoin at anytime.*
This is the difference. Hope you *really* get it now.

The issue you are referring to is from March, 2018. Nevertheless you should do some more research...
There were different firmware updates since then, with the 1.4.1 already addressing the issue in the same month the exploit was discovered.
After 1.5.5 came out (about a year ago) they're now at 1.6.0, never again a word from anybody about the discovered MCU 'issue'. Some other related sources:

Ah, really? So 120,000 core fullnodes are an insignificant amount? LOL. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 11:00:42
It's not a big deal, since you don't really own bitcoin when trading futures. So it's just betting on bitcoin's future value and those you try to short bitcoin will lose millions of dollars.

Faster memory technology is fine but alone won't affect the security of bitcoin (for now). Memory is just holding data, it doesn't compute anything, while CPUs and Gpus do. But even if those were 1000x faster, that wouldn't really make bitcoin unsecure....okay....., perhaps a little tiny bit. But nothing to be concerned about. 
@_date: 2019-06-29 05:02:57

Bitnodes.21.co just counts listening nodes, whereas this graph shows *all* running fullnodes.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:52:55
Not true. *All* core nodes are validating nodes, and also versions below 0.15.x will consider blocks not fitting the consensus rules *in*valid.

Not exactly true. It was added one or too weeks ago but without values for marketcap, so it roamed around position 1000 on their listing. Now the value for marketcap appeared, catapulting the coin to position 5 when sorting is 'by marketcap' (which is default).

It might be unusable or expensive to use but only until next difficulty adjustment and there are many many hodlers who just care about real bitcoin and not some segshit2x altcoin. And you know what will happen then?? You'll see bitcoin skyrocketing, and *moon* will only be a quick short layover.

Add another 2% onto Conbase fee and purchase at ATMs. Many of them have **no KYC** which means you get your coins completely anonymously. Imho this premium is worth it no matter what.

Bitcoin won't get more centralised because of this. It gets more decentralised caused by increasing mass adoption. And as bitcoin stands for the free market, also competition between miners will healthily grow. That's not a bug. It's a feature.
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:35:28
It's even narrow minded and indicates you don't have any clue what you're talking about. If you're full of doubts, it's better to leave bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:13:10
Yeah. Just FUD.
@_date: 2019-12-21 17:00:00
Once the Germans wake up regarding bitcoin we can expect some big money inflows.
Plus there's some bitcoin regulations in place starting with the beginning of the new year. Might be a good thing.

As long as your funds are in the coinbase wallet, it's not really your funds as it's not your keys. But you can and should transfer them out to your own wallet.

Running a full node is the only way of using bitcoin as it is meant to be. The only way of not having to trust a third party. Not for bitcoin's past (because while syncing the blockchain you validate every transaction which has ever occurred yourself) nor for bitcoin's present (because you propagate your transactions yourself without having to rely on anyone else's node and verify the validity of new blocks and new transactions yourself). 
Some mobile wallets then allow you to connect to your own node to achieve the same privacy and sovereignty while on the go. In my view everbody should consider running an own fullnode. Decentralization would definitely benefit of it!
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:25:49

I disagree. The more listening nodes are running the better and more unhindered the network can grow. Recently the amount of fullnodes increased (within just two months) from 60k to 95k, of which about just 10k are listening nodes. At this rate of fullnode count growth it might be advantageous to add a few hundreds or thousands of listening ones as well. Also OP will improve his knowledge about the matter (which is not really hard in that specific case) and he maybe able to help others with it, too. If everbody thought like you, bitcoin's network size wouldn't be where it is already.

The glimmer on the Tencent Finance Liu Peng
domestic regulatory requirements shutting down the bit coin exchange, the bit coin industry chain upstream - the dredging of mine, have also started to be affected.
On 14 November, the glimmer on the Tencent finance from the bit coin miners to learn, from Sichuan Electricity Company has already issued a circular, saying that the use of electricity production bit coin is illegal operations, and the hydroelectric power station needs to stop all the bit coin production, otherwise they will be moved to the punishment."
The dredging of minerals", is a bit coin-world jargon, specifically refers to the use of computing power, in bit-Coin system-generated block (block) continued to be a "hash collision" to win the right to account for the system rewards bit coin. This is a tedious and repetitive process, in bit-Coin industry is vividly described as the digging of mine."
The dredging of minerals", the largest expenditure is in the early stages of the mining and mining investment and the day-to-day functioning of the days of the consuming power. In order to reduce the cost of production and the bit coin mining sites are "The living." The Prism on the Tencent had reported that the benefit from Inner Mongolia and Sichuan two and plenty of power, China has the largest number of bit coin mining, the bits are the production of a monopoly. A bit coin mining board told the Tencent Finance, the Sichuan has the maximum number of water resources, large and small hydroelectric power station there are thousands of outlets, power sufficient, or even very often because of the oversupply of electricity, some of the water should be used for electricity generation can only have been released, we see it is called 'of water'. " Bit coin has saved the disposal of water". Originally from hydroelectric power stations need to be put away the water that is used to supply the bit coin mining, hydroelectric power generation to earn enormous profits, and the colliers you were looking for cheap power.
However, as domestic regulation on bit coin exchange, as well as power companies and small hydroelectric power station, the interests of the bit coin mining, there is an urgent need for the electricity supply, and gradually the local power companies to grab the reins. A miner told the Tencent Finance, Sichuan at the policy level, on the one hand, issued a circular calling for no more new small hydroelectric power stations; on the other hand, the power companies are stepping up efforts to promote the acquisition of small hydroelectric power station, the latter power grid, the bit coin mining low power space increasingly 逼.

@_date: 2019-04-27 20:20:13
Principally you're right. There are new bitcoin issued thus there's inflation. But as you can see [here]( the rate of issuance is decreasing quite quickly. The whole process is planned in a timely manner, the last fraction of a bitcoin will be mined around 2140, but 98% of the whole supply will be in existence by around 2030 with an inflation rate of around just 0.45% at  time. By halving next year the rate of supply drops already below that of gold.

For a quick simple swap use flyp.me, it worked for me several times without any issues and has no KYC. Shapeshift  and changelly should better be avoided! But the truth is by sending the funds to this shapeshift address you propagated the transaction details to blockchain thus everyone could know about the address given by shapeshift now. You have to prove that you are the owner of the sending address by signing it. That's the only way to prove that it's your funds.

The longer your fullnode is up, the better it is connected within the network. The better it is connected, the more data is processed. The more data being processed, the more resources is required for fulfilling its 'job'. Nothing to worry about, imho. Just an indication of being well connected.

No, it's not. Theoretically you could tenfold the blocksize thus tenfold the transactions per second and let the average fee drop to just a tenth to make make miners have the same fee reward. The most compelling argument is and ever was that raising blocksize results in less decentralization. For bigger blocks to be processed you'd have to have more bandwidth, more storage and more processing power in terms of cpu and ram. Many would likely turn off their nodes, the rate of new nodes entering the network would decrease badly. *That's* why we shouldn't raise blocksize until *really* necessary. But PoW itself would work anyway, even having bigger blocks.

Such a showboat, this smart aleck is. Validators aren't money transmitters. They just relay *if bitcoin is gonna be transmitted and if such transaction was plausible*, but they don't transmit money itself. Neither do the miners. Money transmitters are third parties who relay the transmitted money itself being in control of it for a short period of time. So within the bitcoin protocol there is no money transmitter, there is no third party being in control of the money and relaying it. So, buddy. Just shut up.

Some cryptos do that, eg byteball or iota. But as far as I know, you always need kind of "authority" nodes, which keep the records just in case they were the remaining. Simply said, without the ledger stored in a "hard" way like the blockchain stored on a hard drive, but only stored in a way it depends on being continuously powerd by energy, once you shut down all nodes, the complete transaction history, validated by cryptographic proof is deleted and you cannot rebuild it. So in the end you need those remaining nodes which are run by certain entities and let the system appear to be pretty centralized and controllable in a way *bitcoin* is immune to.

1) Consider running a full node. If you're running it 24/7 you're always synced.   
2) If you really want to migrate to mycelium (which I would only do for smaller amounts of funds), just create a completely new wallet and *transfer* your funds. It's easier to do and a freshly setup wallet comes with higher security. Remember to write down your seed and store in safe place(s).

*It’s more ideology than financial instrument, and ideology is rarely a sustainable store of value.*
But what is the dollar then? Isn't it also the an ideology gaining its value from hardlining believers and users? With the difference that those lambs eventually get fooled by the masters of puppets which devalue their great currency step by step just to suck them off? He also claims crypto is not about changing financial system and storing value but "just" about creating culture. I think it's both. Because isn't every culture founded on an intuitive ideology? Isn't a cultural founding ideology a very sustaining store of value? How would ideological value be stored better than in manifesting itself in a culture?   
Some of his ideas are good but his conclusions seem to be incomplete. Regrettable because he might be able to move further.

Why relying/trusting even a likely very secure procedure with a most likelyhood of a successful result, if you can have it very cheap, easy and trustless by just abandoning the old wallet for a fresh one?

Remember the days when UASF happened? It were the nodes who played out their power and the hashing power couldn't do the slightest thing about it. That's how we got segwit.

@_date: 2018-03-12 14:39:01

Any other method of participating in the network means having to trust and being vulnerable to dishonesty. Bitcoin is all about eliminating the need of trust which requires you to verify the validity of bitcoin's complete history for yourself in order to being able to have an entirely sovereign and valid position in the network. It's the only way of truly *using* bitcoin. The truth is that's the only possibility you can 100% be sure you won't get fooled while participating.

You're starting to dislike bitcoin because your tx took two hours? I started disliking the banking system a few years ago because it took about at least two days. Furthermore I looked up your tx. It was 8sat/byte not 12, as you stated. Given the fact you were then also using a tx accelerator, your set fee was probably even less than 8sat/byte. Trxs taking longer to be processed is actually a good sign. It's a sign of adoption. And again you should remember you're using the most secure payment system on earth. So two hours until settlement is actually pretty fast. Next time choose your fee more wisely or transact using an insecure shitcoin network. It's up to you.

Using a bitcoin ATM you don't transfer money. You just buy tokens. Nobody can prohibit you to buy something unless the bought commodity is illegal. Which in case of bitcoin is not. There is no EU law which considers those tokens to be illegal, correct me if I am wrong. So imho the restrictives you mentioned are not applicable.

Bitcoin works so great. I really don't have any wishes beside more people would run their own fullnodes and more stores accepting LN payments by implementing BTCPay with lightning. Overall I am just excited about the development and new things to come.

Any wallet should implement coincontrol. So user could mark this crap funds *unspendable* and render such attacks obsolete. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 10:52:00


No. *At the end* there won't be USD anymore.


Think again. If they print more and more dollars, they will badly devalue their shitty 'currency'. If on top they start to buy bitcoin, price will rise, not fall.


Of course. Sell shitty dollars as much as you can, never trade bitcoin back to dollars, pay as much as you can directly with bitcoin. If you're really clever, immediately buy the spent bitcoin back with the dollars you got remaining.


That's why there are so many 'hodlers' who always recommend **not** to trade bitcoin (against fiat). They have known that for years and will never sell for those crappy dollars. Be assured, the dollar bubble will pop when countries begin selling their USD reserves to become independent again. Just to mention Russia, China and others. I don't think they will play that game any longer.

Due to the segwit upgrade in 2017 there could theoretically already be 4 Mbyte blocks (2 Mbyte block weight) when purely segwit transactions were involved. But to answer your question: Yes, doubling the maxblocksize would also double the possible txs/sec (on chain), which is not needed right now since LN is evolving.
@_date: 2019-01-07 06:03:45
Yes, that will be possible.

Deleting the wallet file should be sufficient to "start" a new wallet as bitcoin qt then generates a new wallet when rebooting it. Go on running your full node and use it for short and mid-term storage as well as for payments you do regularly. Route any mobile SPV wallet to your own node for quick secure mobile payments. Store the amount of coins you plan to hodl long-term on a hardware wallet. That's what I do.
@_date: 2019-01-17 11:37:56
Right. That's why I said 'nonsense'. 
@_date: 2018-03-10 11:39:50
Smartest people just buy and decrease the overall supply by just hodling without any intention to selling at all. Once bitcoin becomes a true currency, which follows being a good store of value (which at the moment it still isn't), those smartest people will exchange btc for goods.

Not really relevant, imho (at least when you don't denominate in usd anymore). 


Maybe. But one has to consider that there will also be competition in the LN fee 'market', and some time in the future, when there will be thousands of possible payment routes, the LN wallets would most likely choose the 'cheapest' one.

Close the app completely. Restart and tap 'Reload account'. Seems to be a bug which will certainly be resolved within one of the future updates. Another bug occurring is that when you do this routine, the app doesn't switch to the next empty hd address but shows the first one of the derivation path. You have to press 'Recieve' to make mycelium realize the correct next empty address. But your funds are safe.

For most people trading bitcoin ends up having less bitcoin than they had before. So only trade, if you are a pro trader. If you want to end up in long term profit, accumulating and hodling is the better way to go. Regarding the arbitraging: You *can* try that. But once one solely deal isn't successful (for whatever reason) you end up fucked having lost a shitload of money that you might have made within plenty of your previous trades. In my view that's too risky and a zero sum game.
@_date: 2019-01-02 15:36:52
They realized there doesn't seem to be a way around crypto, imho, which is correct. So the only way to succeed is otherwise embracing it. Smart move if it eventually turns out to be true.

The real problem comes into existence when it's possible wealth increases by itself. That's why bitcoin abandons the idea of interest.

For bigger amounts of funds use a hardware wallet (ledger, trezor...) and an open source mobile wallet (samourai, mycelium) for on the go payments.
@_date: 2019-01-02 19:56:46
It's possible but *not yet* that easy, cause both of you have to setup a LN wallet, open a LN channel funded with some BTC from one of your personal bitcoin wallets, your sister would additionally have to prepare the LN wallet for receivings. That can be done using   
But if it's just about a quick payment, on-chain trx are settled within 30 minutes for $0.10, which is not expensive, imho. LN is still in its early childhood, things will get way more comfortable in the future.

That's because they don't understand one fundamental thing: All bitcoin forks are/will be worth close to nothing (as all of those 20-30 already existing forks are). The reasons are as follows:
- Bitcoin is exclusively leaderless, there is no sole entity deciding on bitcoin's fate beside the whole bitcoin economy and community by participating within the network's consensus rules.
- Bitcoin has a tremendous network effect which cannot be successful competed against due to first mover advantage
- Bitcoin has the highest amount of fullnodes running all around the world (about 60.000 at the time of writing) which renders bitcoin the most decentralized crypto (likely ever) in existence.
- Meanwhile bitcoin's mining distribution has also increased to healthy levels whereas its hashrate is the highest within the crypto space
- Bitcoin has a outstanding development team consisting of hundreds of very smart people all around the world
- Bitcoin has the leading support within companies, politics and the community as a whole
- Bitcoin's second layer solution lightning network which is built on the most secure blockchain in existing is able to process transactions blazing fast. Especially the aspect of having a totally secure first layer and a lightning fast second layer is the most genius step bitcoin could have taken.
In my view all this can hardly be beaten by any shitcoin (any other alt as well as all the results of forking/splitting the original chain).
All those shitcoins are just stupid pump and dump getting rich quick schemes which will finally die out when more use cases are built on top of bitcoin's blockchain. Surely it will still take some time but time is on bitcoin's side.
There are and will ever only be 21 million *valid* bitcoins in existence, so the fear of being inflated by various additional shitcoins is completely groundless.

I guess it shouldn't be too difficult to find someone who is willing to do a deal. Because the risk is on your side. Once the BTC are transferred, an attacker could try to reverse the paypal payment and you would sit there with neither bitcoin (where transactions are irreversible) nor paypal dollars. It's not worth it, is it?
Edit: typo.
@_date: 2019-01-23 11:38:18
Right now the smallest unit of bitcoin is Satoshi. One Satoshi equals one hundredmillionth bitcoin. So there are 2,100,000,000,000,000 Satoshis when the last (fraction of a) bitcoin is mined. That should be enough forever. But if it's not we simply add one or two digits by softforking. Theoretically Bitcoin is divisible infinitely.

Because many people use it as their wallet, not considering that this way they don't control their own keys. So there's a high risk of hacks, confiscations, capital controls and even exit scams. If you're just using it as an exchange and transfer your funds to a wallet where *you* control the keys immediately after purchasing you're good to go. Although it's stupid in general to support such monopolies imho.

Blocksize increase (if applied too early) causes decentralization decrease. Required resources for running fullnodes are already quite high (bandwidth, storage, processing power). Raising the blocksize would lead to still more resources being required, which would in return bring an decrease in amount of people willing to invest those resources (run an own node). First priority is to keep up or even gain decentralization because that's what makes bitcoin that secure.

One way would be using localbitcoins, paxful, hodlhodl or an ATM. But you'll pay a pretty high fee (3% to 10%). Another would be depositing your funds into a bank account, register at one of the 'standard' exchanges, buy bitcoin and transfer to the recipient.

His book 'The Bitcoin Standard' is one of the best in crypto space discussing bitcoin's long-term economical aspects.   
Describing the evolution of money, Saifedean comes to the conclusion that bitcoin is finally the hardest money ever been created. Evolving from just a collectible to a store of value and at the same time to a perfect medium of exchange, it fulfills all the requirements to become a global reserve currency.   
Saifedean studied economics, Keynesian school, which propagates the inflationary idea as the one and only true and correct perspective of economy. He came to the conclusion, that this 'Keynesian' view could easily get debunked. He changed sides and began to dive into 'Austrian School of economics', which rather tries to explain economics around preferably deflationary aspects. The idea of bitcoin being hardest deflationary sound money probably is, what made him write his fantastic book.   
Ammous teaches economics and other belonging subjects at an university in Lebanon. One of the best bitcoin educators along with Andreas Antonopoulos, of course.

Thanks. Interesting. The last chapter gives a brief summary:
5. Concluding observations and next steps
70. The use of crypto-assets, which depend on cryptography and DLT, has evolved rapidly in recent years and is anticipated to continue to do so as the technologies continue to be piloted within and beyond the financial sector.
71. Based on the current assessments of the competent authorities, crypto-asset-related activity in the EU is regarded as relatively limited, confirming that, at this time, such activities do not appear to give rise to implications for, or risks to, financial stability.
However, because some crypto-assets/activities do not appear to fall within the scope of current EU financial services law and are highly risky, as identified in this report, risks arise with regard to consumer protection, operational resilience, and market integrity.
Moreover, the proliferation of legislative and supervisory actions at the national level, driven by consumer protection considerations, gives rise to risks for the level playing field.
Crypto-assets also give rise to other issues which are beyond the scope of competence of the EBA (e.g. regarding accounting and tax treatment).
72. For these reasons, in this report the EBA advises the European Commission to carry out a cost/benefit analysis to assess, on a holistic basis, whether EU-level action is appropriate and feasible at this stage to address the issues identified. Such a cost/benefit analysis should take account of the potential application of DLT and crypto-assets beyond the financial sector, and should extend to aspects relating to the environmental impact of some crypto-asset activity. The EBA also advises the European Commission to have regard to the latest recommendations and any further standards or guidance issued by the FATF as part of a holistic review of the need, if any, for action at the EU level, and calls on the Commission to take steps where possible to promote consistency in the accounting treatment of crypto-assets. 56
73. The EBA will keep under review the need for any further actions within the scope of its statutory competence and stands ready to support the European Commission in relation to any further analysis of issues arising in relation to crypto-assets. In the meantime the EBA will take forward in 2019 the following actions:
a. the development of a common monitoring template which competent authorities can issue to institutions, payment institutions and electronic money institutions (and, as appropriate, other financial institutions) to monitor the level and type of crypto-asset activity underway (section 4.4.1);
b. the assessment of business practices of institutions, payment institutions and electronic money institutions regarding crypto-asset advertisings (which should be well-balanced, clear and not misleading), pre-contractual information about the risks related to crypto-asset transactions for consumers (lack of legal framework, liquidity risk etc), and the disclosure of the rights and safeguards applicable to consumers in the context of any crypto-asset services provided by those institutions to assess what actions are needed to ensure high standards of consumer protection (section 4.4.2);
c. report to the European Commission on the conclusion of the BCBS work with
regard to the prudential treatment of banks’ holdings of/exposures to crypto-
assets (section 4.3);
d. keep under review the need for any guidance to support a common application of the current prudential rules under the CRD/CRR as regards institutions’ exposures to/holdings of crypto-assets (section 4.3) (ongoing);
e. carry out continuous monitoring of innovation and of the regulatory perimeter, including with regard to crypto-asset activities (section 2.5) (ongoing).

Close the app completely. Restart and tap 'Reload account'. Seems to be a bug which will certainly be resolved within one of the future updates.

Bitcoin is a highly secure settlement layer and it's infrastructure is due to censorship-resistance way more trustworthy than those of any third party like banks or other financial service providers. For higher amounts of value, bitcoin is simply more trusted. But the good thing is we have lightning. And it's fast! As far as the calculations go it is capable of doing millions transactions per second. Once the technology is ripe, it will easily outperform competitors' amount of trxs/sec *without* having to sacrifice the outstanding security of bitcoin's network. First I didn't like idea of having a second layer as payment layer but now I see it's a stroke of genius!

Create the paperwallet not only offline but also in a secure environment such as a live linux distro bootet from usb freshly installed. Make sure that you're really offline, disconnecting LAN cables and be 100% sure you're not connected any WLAN, at best you shut down WLAN completely in your Linux distro. Save the paperwallet onto another portable storage medium (sdcard, USB Stick...) which you can plug in your printer directly. Factory reset the printer after printing is finished, don't connect it to any network until reset done. Wipe you portable storage medium at least 20 times using dedicated software. Better destroy this medium if you're dealing with bigger stack of funds.

It would be cool to see such kind of page where there are classified ads from people all around the world. 
In map mode one would have to specify a radius relative to a certain location in which ads are shown. You could click them similar to  and would be shown the ad's details/contact information. An additional list mode where ads are listed and can be sorted (by age, category, distance and so forth) would complete the user experience.   
Similar to wikipedia the page would be completely open and registration free.

My brain, processing Saifedean Ammous' 'The Bitcoin Standard', regarding his thoughts on the evolution of 'hard' money. (Hard to produce, hard to forge, hard to appropriate/steal).

Bitcoin in his view as well as in mine, is the hardest form money ever being created. It will compete and outperform any other form of 'soft' money.

@_date: 2017-09-01 20:08:27
The hardware wallet just keeps they keys afaik and the transaction is signed on the device. The transaction processing itself including the recieving addresses are processed by the software interface the hardware wallet is used with. So while native trezor and also legder software is capable of managing segwit transactions, mycelium is not. So in my opinion it shouldn't be possible to use trezor and mycelium for segwit transactions.
@_date: 2017-09-01 09:48:01

Some have yet, some won't. 


Some do yet, some won't.


Just a few will be convinced. And those are getting less.

Bitcoin distributed technology cannot be broken by just declaring it illegal. Many will use anyway. So will I. Will you?


Again. Is highly unlikely that may happen.


That's not how bitcoin works, so it won't.

It *makes* sense to transact value with bitcoin. But that doesn't mean you should pay every coffee or loaf of bread with it. You wouldn't do with gold either. But paying a car, a house or other expensive stuff nevertheless would make sense. Litecoin on the other hand could be used for all the little things in life, you regularly spend on. Demand for gold doesn't directly depend on the demand for money so supply and demand of both don't directly compete with each other in reality.

Upgrading always matters since the core devs do a very sophisticated job very well. In my understanding running a certain version is also a political vote. The rising versions 0.15.x and all the discussions around segwit2x for me are the process of consensus finding which will not be ignored, even not by those remaining NYA signers. In the end they will fear losing money which is the reason the fork is very likely not going to happen.
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:52:13
One thing: The author claims segwit2x is an implementation of the core development team. That's not true. Segwit2x is an attempt of hostile takeover, initiated by some companies. Bitcoin (core devs) have nothing to do with that segwit2x thing.

Not if the blocks are full, the blocks are currently just a quarter of what they could be, sometimes less. If now blocks were full, you'd have a max block size of 4Mbyte with a 2 Mbyte blockweight, with a volume of up to 80 Gbyte a day / 2.4 Tbyte month. For segwit2x double that and you end up at almost 5 Tbyte a month. That's why I oppose segwit2x.

How comes bitcoin is worth $4500 up from zero? The same reason applies to bitcoin being worth $10k, $20k, $50k and so on in the future. "They" can't sell more than "they" acquired. In the meantime new hodlers join in on and on, while "they" might be playing their games. Let them play if they want. But those games will get more and more expensive and one day, "they" can't afford another round while we just sit, eat popcorn and hodl. That's what I am doing for years and it works.

Not true. Fee reward is about 2 BTC, block reward 12.5 BTC. 2/12.5 = 84% from block reward, not 99%. 16% from fees, and blocks are not even full. Being full, they'd get around 25% in fees which will double to 50% in 2020.

A hardware has to be bought (I recommend ledger nano s, great device, great development). 
A paperwallet doesn't cost anything. You can follow this guide but do it in an offline environment (download the whole bitaddress.org page and **disconnect from the internet**, then open the downloaded page. It is best the not use a wlan connected printer but a wired. After following the steps from the guide **delete your browser cache!**).

Anyone after diving a bit deeper into bitcoin will understand that the gains are *result* of the technology. Centralized cryptos will never be worth as much as bitcoin. That said there seems to be a relationship between price and level of decentralization (nodes, miners, companies, services, wallets, users, devs. All of those amounts and distribution are increasing). So decentralization is *the* core aspect.
@_date: 2017-10-08 20:39:06
It's very likely the overall graph of bitcoin is and s-curve meaning that after a  heavy rise, acceleration will slow down finding a price range of saturation. Volatility will decrease and price gets more stable. At that time it might be smart to switch to "mBTC" or even to "bits" as standard. At those levels one can then consider putting prices just in BTC without having to think about them in any other currency.

Since Jihan didn't follow the HK agreement, core didn't either. Segwit was implemented by UASF (user activated softfork) at the beginning of August 2017. There is/was no need to increase blocksize by hardfork after all. Noone cares/cared what Jihan is/was doing now.

No. The make the ridiculous claim that by simply increasing the blocksize Satoshi's vision comes true.

Running a full node means validating blocks. If block don't fit consensus rules (for example segwit2x blocks which maybe oversized) they will be considered invalid and will be rejected by the network (which results in loss for the given miner). If you want bitcoin to stay bitcoin your decision running a full node is very reasonable. Plus you need not trust any other node validating and forwarding *your* transactions. Turn it as you want, it's benefiting for the whole thing.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:53:43

The main thing to complain about is their involvement in backdoor agreements such as segwit2x. Those hostile takeover attempts make this any other companies a NO-GO because they mispay attention to the nature of bitcoin which is OPEN SOURCE, not CLOSED DOORS!

Pretty tiny fee. That could take some time, at least still some hours. If you're not in a hurry, hold on until confirmed. This site  shows its mempool and pending transactions and for me it was always quite reliable. Once the counter goes down to 1000-2000 txs, chances are good your tx gets confirmed.

Own your private keys (or mnemonic) and wait until after the fork. Solutions will pop up.

GBTC is a joke, yes. You pay a big premium for NOT owning bitcoin itself. "Not your keys, not your bitcoin!" as Andreas Antonopoulos often says. Isn't that funny? I can only recommend buying real bitcoin and keep your keys save! Furthermore GBTC already "crashed" in the past, when bitcoin suddenly rose hard. It's very likely that pattern will repeat.   
One correction about the article: There won't be an upgrade of bitcoin in November, as the article claims. It's just that a new altcoin will be created, B2X, but it has nothing to do with bitcoin (BTC).
@_date: 2017-10-18 03:37:02
The NYA agreement is about an upgrade on the bitcoin protocol, actually not about creating an altcoin. That's why some call it contentious fork. It has no replay protection, so I am excited, how coinbase will handle that.

Both of them are NYA signers and will most likely convert your real BTC for some segwit2x altcoin which they will call BTC afterwards so be careful. Better send your funds to a hardware wallet or (securely created) paperwallet, which is for free. In case of a split you will have access to your coins on *both* chains!
@_date: 2017-10-08 09:29:52

@_date: 2017-10-25 19:30:50
Thumbs up for choosing the right side! Bitcoin will be referred to as BTC, while the segwit2x altcoin will get a different descriptive name, e. g. B2X.
Edit: In case, bitpay and coinbase really won't change their position, I can only strongly advise to not use them anymore! You risk your BTC!
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:41:58

Okay. Then just buy some shitty alts. You will see, where this will most likely end up. Bitcoin is the king and has "first of its kind" advantage while being the most matured. Also crypto is a completely new technology so the comparison to AOL and so those lacks a bit. Bitcoin will find its best way   evolving due to permanently ongoing development.

Some fools claim Satoshi wanted bitcoin to be a "peer to peer payment system", as he called it in his white paper, so they hardline want to force it to be PayPal 2.0 (that's those bitcoin cash guys and also the segwit2x shills). They don't want to understand that simply raising the blocksize (which needs a hardfork) will put risk to the whole ecosystem. But you're right. It doesn't need this merchant adoption to be successful. It's the other way around. The more successful it is, the more the merchant adoption will grow.

Okay let's stay rational, let's say just by 6,000, no *just 600* times. 1 BTC would value $3,600,000. So 0.1 BTC would be around $360,000. *I would* call that rich. I know, I know, it's just hypothetical. But it's not as absurd as it first sounds. We're still in an early adoption stage, there's still a lot room to grow.

Move funds to your trezor. Nothing can happen if you store the seed safely! The other option is bread which will as they stated follow the longest chain and the most hashpower by default, which means you put your real BTC at risk to be converted into some altcoin which bread then calls BTC. That's most likely not what you want. Having coins sitting on a trezor means controlling the private keys. After splits would have happened, you can easily decide what and how to do next.  In case of a split there will be thousands of other people in exactly the same situation than you are and there will pop up plenty possibilities with most flexibility.

@_date: 2017-10-19 22:19:15
I can't advise anything regarding to your specific situation. But for the paperwallet:
You can follow this guide but do it in an offline environment (download thep whole bitaddress.org page and **disconnect from the internet**, then open the downloaded page. It is best the not use a wlan connected printer but a wired. After following the steps from the guide **delete your browser cache!**). 
@_date: 2017-10-03 10:43:02
No. But I wasn't even able to open that zip file, so something must have been corrupting while downloading...

@_date: 2017-10-17 18:25:27
I can't tell people often enough: Don't rely on web/online wallets, also not on software wallets (on mobiles) if you're not tech savy. Always use hardware or (securely created!) paperwallet!

OP is a liar! Did he watch the clip at all? This programmer explains, why **it's NOT too late to invest in bitcoin and why he's quite bullish!** A shame!

Are you talking about antpool, the miner that as of today had 15.28% of all hashrate?  I don't give a shit about little chinese pussjihan.

Smart guys don't *invest* in bitcoin. They just *get rid* of worthless dollars in exchange for the first *real* currency.




No. Just exchange crap fiat for BTC. 


I copied the blockchain by hand into a textbook, so no. It's always recoverable.




The majority of people aren't that stupid. Bitcoins means first real financial souveignity. Most of us have already understood that, the rest will follow.

You can ban such manually, by right-clicking, ban for one year. But is there a way to automatically do that??

Keep them (own your private keys). In case of a split you may end up with coins on both chains,  *IF* the split really happens.
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:18:23
I think you missed that train. The block on which the fork should have / has occured has already passed. But nevertheless, go for it, buy some BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:06:08


Bitcoin *is* the money. For the case you haven't realized yet. Also: Forget the idea of *investing in bitcoin*. Instead think of it as *getting rid of worthless dollars*. That's how it will play out. Remember my words.

They are part of the NYA so they will do what anyone of them will be doing: They will most likely list Segwit2x-coin as BTC after the fork. So your BTC will be converted into an altcoin (called BTC by blockchain.info) and you may lose access to your real BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-19 23:06:56
Bitcoin will be stable once a certain level of saturation is achieved. My guess is it's at least around $500k per BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:04:29
This is not true signaling. It's just some miners added "NYA" to the block comment signaling the intend to signal. True signaling would be done by bit 4 and no miners are doing that.

Never use Bitpay! They're are anti bitcoin! Instead always use  as it's completely open source, has no 3rd party fees and you're in full control over incoming funds!!

Why would anyone trust a completely unknown guy? There are services like Dave's  with quite a good reputation.
Looking at your comment history you are claiming to be able to 'revover stolen bitcoin'. This really sounds like a scam to more experienced users.
Once the funds are stolen = were moved, you can do close to *nothing* about it.
The only possible thing was to track down the hacker and have a convincing visit. But I hardly believe that this is what you are up to...
@_date: 2017-10-19 10:56:23
Not yet. But once bitcoin reaches gold market cap and trades around $380k per BTC they will reconsider it being. 
Gold is   
- too difficult to store safely   
- too difficult to transfer   
- too difficult to trade   
- too easy to steal   
while bitcoin is not. So advantages overweight at the latest when market reveals bitcoin's true value, which is certainly not those ridiculous $5k per coin.
@_date: 2017-10-03 22:41:19


Impossible. Price results from supply and demand.

You won't stop *me* and many others to use bitcoin, that's the whole point.


Ah. It is? That's new to me. I know some people accepting bitcoin. And some companies. That's it.


Bullshit. Bitcoin is valued at $8000. And you can spend it close to nowhere.


I don't care who exactly the Rothschilds are nor which religion they believe in. But I care for monopolies of money which control and enslave mankind. That has to stop! That's why now there's bitcoin. True financial sovereignty.

Sorry you sodl. But hodlers, more and more, will be hodling. We don't care about traders. They're just keeping bitcoin in healthy motion. The bigger the whale who sells, the better. More new hodlers will have chance to buy in. Remember my words [evil laughing].
@_date: 2017-10-20 11:06:42
I guess monero and zcash might be bigger problems in this regard.
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:42:58
No, thanx. I'll just wait 29 hours. Then EDA (difficulty adjustment) on bitcoin cash with about 725% difficulty increase. Txs in mempool will rapidly be processed when miners switch back to mine BTC, which is way more profitable then.
@_date: 2019-09-12 19:35:38
Really great work, awesome. Deep dive into bitcoin privacy without missing anything. Very recommendable! Thanks a lot. Saved for recurring offline usage.

@_date: 2017-10-08 10:52:35
If you are a hodler, there shouldn't be a problem. Even if 90% hashrate would move, which most likely won't, because B2X won't be profitable to mine, it will just take some time (maybe weeks, worst case months) until difficulty adjusts and everything is fine again. There's also possibility to change from POW to POS in case the adjustment takes to long but that'll probably not be needed. This way or that, as a hodler using a hardware you'll be fine.
@_date: 2017-10-08 11:30:21
A hardware wallet is considered more secure since the keys it contains will "never see the daylight". Software wallets are often/always online and may be vulnerable to hacking attacks.   
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:50:15
*Some* are against it? Lol. Isn't it everybody (exept some miners and companies)?

It takes its value to the top (by reducing supply). 
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:36:18
Let them mine what they want. But they also have to live with the value the market defines for their altcoin. Doing so won't even be profitable short-term. Long-term all of those will go down with their shitcoin.

A good player? CZ, the wanna-be-King thought he could just roll back the bitcoin blockchain to 'retransfer' their hacked coins, instead of just bailing their hacked users out and admitting that exchange insecurity is *their* fault.

Yes, batching is as least as important. But the thread is about segwit.

That's exactly what sheeple are fed with.

He is such an incompetent idiot. The 'best' part is about every bank ("17,000 all over the world") running a node, which would be **"more than we have now..."** Completely false! At the time when that conference took place, there were almost 100,000 full-nodes running. There's historical data about that online and the real Satoshi wouldn't have claimed such false bullshit. Maybe it's Faketoshi hasn't ever heard about non-listening fullnodes?

Personally, I have the idea, I cannot have enough bitcoin. Whenever possible I buy a bit more and I don't care about forks whatsoever. In the beginning of August I was gifted some bitcoin cash, that's okay but I don't rely on such things. BTC is what matters and that's why I would buy now (and/or hodl).

No. Not a real concern since mempools are quite empty over the past months and imho that won't change mid-term. So both segwit and legacy fees will very likey stay quite low. But that's just my opinion. Check out this site before transacting, and do your trxs when mempools are empty and transacting is cheap.

I wouldn't use breadwallet at they will consider segwit2x to be BTC in case the segwit2x chain is longer / gets more hashpower. I have never been interested in electrum so I don't know if that's secure or a good way storing when forks occur (I don't like the idea of software wallets to store bigger amounts of BTC). I recommend using a hardware or paperwallet.

Regrettably the first, not the latter.
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:02:19
Move it to your trezor. Being in full control over your coins will give you full flexibility on what you might do after the fork. If no replay protection will be implemented you have to pay attention not to make mistakes with sending coins since it's possible you send coins on both chains, which is what you likely not want. So keep your coins in your trezor, wait for the dust to settle and stay up to date by visiting from time to time. There will be solutions to all kinds of "problems" regarding the split in case it really happens.
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:30:23

It won't be profitable to mine the segwit2x coin because it will, if at all, have minimal value, as the futures trading shows.  Rather invest in BTC and hodl. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:10:26
Basically this just means if you buy bitcoin at coinbase after the split you don't actually buy bitcoin. I hope not many people let themselves fool this way.
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:00:23
At least it doesn't connect to btc1 (segwit2x) nodes, so yes it does. Better would be setting up a fullnode.

Ah.. Yep. And we need to boycott paper... Because a bcash address can be written on it. No. Honestly. Ledger has always had a very neutral stance on the whole scaling debate. They just wanted to make those split coins accessible to their users in a convenient way and that's what they did. Not more, lot less. If they hadn't done so, many ledgers users wouldn't have had the ability to dump their bcash coins that easy for real bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-09-05 18:45:13
There are a lot, but **don't use**: Bitpay, Breadwallet, Jaxx, Copay. They've damn high fees and also support the hostile take over attempt [NYA/Segwit2x]( I use mycelium and don't care about high fees, as I anyway just hodl.   
Edit: [Here]( is a list of honest companies. You can look through it and will for sure find one or another. Samurai wallet for example is also great.
Edit2: Also Coinomi is a good one that supports a great variation of alts too, but regrettably their code isn't open source anymore.
@_date: 2017-09-01 06:39:53

No. It just adds volume and volatility because it's physically settled. Those physically settled coins *have to be traded at spot price*. The spot price is the result of supply and demand of the actual asset, where there are only 18 million coins outhere, respectively 21 million coins ever. There is a growing number of hard-line hodlers of actual bitcoins who reduce supply tremendously. So bitcoin cannot be shorted to the ground endlessly. Once all weak hands have sold, bitcoin is poised to rise. So. Nothing really changes.

Mr. Rochard has really great guides out on how to easily setup Bitcoin fullnodes with lightning integration. Big thanks for that. But now it seems he's turning crazy. Or not?
In his view bitcoin community has about 10 to 20 years time to discuss integration of inflation.
Let's take 10 years. There will be 3 halvings until 2029. Next year, 2024 and 2028, 5 until 20 years will have passed in 2032 and 2036.
Current reward is 12.5 BTC per block, in 2020 it drops to 6.25 BTC, 2024 brings 3.125 and 2028 drops it to 1.5625 BTC, that's the number it to be in 10 years, 2029.
In 2032 reward drops to 0.78125, in 2036 to 0.390625, that's what it'll be in 20 years.
So reward is roughly dropping to about an eleventh of the current after 10 years (and to just 3.125% of the current reward after 20 years).
**If we're just focusing on fees/reward and leave out *any* other likey changing circumstance (price for hardware and energy, setting up infrastructure, paying employees [which is basically very synthetic construct but nevertheless])** one could conclude the following:
IF bitcoin price rises 11 times over the next 10 years (=$110k) respectively 32 times (=$320k) during next 20 years, mining should still be as profitable as it is right now at $10k-ish.
*Imho those price levels are easily doable.*
So right now I have to say: Fork off, Pierre, if you wish to but it's very likey me and many other bitcoiners will sell the forked shitcoin and stick with *hard capped* bitcoin.

Okay. But *always* recheck the pasted address!! There's clipboard malware outthere, capable to change the copied address to a different one that belongs to an attacker!
On your second point: It's hardly possible to send bitcoin into the abyss. Almost *any* wallet checks the validity of the address your sending to and gives an error message in case it's not valid.

There are no real sources about that claim. The biggest addresses all belong to the biggest exchanges. I am a bit concerned about that as it shows: Most users haven't understood the 'Not your keys, not your coins' - idea. But only one exchange exit scamming would make most users understand. Apart of that this exchange would make itself obsolete.


No. Bitcoin has value because it is *censorship-resistant* and very scarce.  
You can exchange anything into fiat. But that doesn't make it more or less valuable.

It wasn't ignored. It's just that finding a private key belonging to a funded address is more likely than him being Satoshi. For the first the chance is considered to be zero.
Even judge Reinhardt found CWS is heavily lacking credibility.
If he wanted to destroy bitcoin, he would rather prove *now* that he's Satoshi, by signing the genesis block and then give the outlook of dumping his coins. Because it's highly likely price will be a lot higher at the beginning of 2020 which would make it much harder to tank the price by dumping the same amount of coins. Proving to be Satoshi would be so easy... if he was. But it's *impossible* to prove it if you aren't.  
I remember the day when back in 2016 he 'revealed' his identity. A 'tl;dr'-blogpost with an extraordinary cryptographical stunt- (which later turned out anybody could do this way) fake proof and Gavin Andresen admitting he believes CSW's story... It was ridiculous. And it still is. CWS is a fraud. End of the story.

All of them work in the same way. Some are more extensive some are less. I guess [Green Wallet]( is very beginner friendly. Mycelium and Samourai are also great. **Be sure to write down the words given you by the wallet during setup process. It's the backup to your complete funds. Store it very securely!**
@_date: 2019-09-20 10:03:25
Both mentioned wallets are the best regarding privacy. If you want to drive the tip in terms of privacy, setup an own fullnode and connect it to Wasabi, respectively setup Samourai including Dojo and connect your fullnode with it as well. Do it using a vpn, tor or both at the same time.
You can use both mentioned wallets simultaneously but (afaik) not with the same keys. So you have two wallets which work separately.
Buying at ATMs is a good privacy measurement, if it doesn't follow KYC. Just visit one, move through the menus and look if you're asked to give any of personal data (including phone number). If not, your okay. You can abort the process of purchasing at ATM at any time.
Hope that helps.

If you want to hodl, get your coins out. It *is not* your coins, if you don't control the keys! You alone. Cheap but tricky way is creating a secure  paperwallet, hardware wallet (Ledger, Trezor, Keepkey) is the most comfortable and vey secure way.
Furthermore if you are in control of your keys, you will very likely get same amount of the new altcoin, B2X, once the split will have happened, similar to when bitcoin cash was created in the beginning of August.  If you hold them in their wallet, you might end up with no BTC anymore but B2X with the amount you held in BTC.


If you trust them, it's your decision. I hope you won't get dissatisfied. But *you* don't have more than their word. *I* have my keys.

There are about 40 million millionaires all over the world. But only half of them could ever own 1 BTC at the same time. The remaining 20 million millionaires as well as the rest of the world (around 7.7 **billion** people) wouldn't own *any* BTC at all.

Miners. They try to force bitcoin network to be slow and expensive to push for their segwit2x agenda. If miners wanted, the blocks could be filled with way more transactions and they could also include more segwit txs which drastically decreased within last weeks and everybody was wondering about. This pretending will go on until it's clear also for the miners that their segwit2x altcoin will die in the end. Until that: Be patient, pay more tx fee or just *hodl*.

Since coinbase is part of NYA, a backdoor agreement about a hostile takeover of bitcoin by some companies, it's very likely you end up with no btc but instead this segwit2x altcoin, which coinbase then will call btc. It's very likely you lose your real btc when storing at coinbase during the fork. Best is to transfer to hardware or (securely created) paperwallet.
Edit: This refers to the potential chain split in November. If it's about bitcoin gold, I don't think coinbase gave a statement about this but your conclusion might be the same. Transfer your coins out of coinbase into a secure wallet.

No. They say they'll follow the longest chain but don't know how the would prevent chain hopping. Only a tech savy user can use the node tethering feature being secure. In other words they support segwit2x by default.

Get a bitcoin wallet for your mobile, like samourai, mycelium, Blockstream's green wallet or any other open source well reviewed one.
Visit a bitcoin ATM 
Buy a small fraction of bitcoin for cash and let the ATM send to one of your addresses (given you by your wallet). If the ATM follows KYC (wants your data) look for another one.
Play with your crypro once you got it (send back and forth and such) and get comfortable with using bitcoin wallets.
Don't invest more than you could afford to lose and never store your funds on exchanges longer than needed. Don't have weak hands.

If you (still) own some BCH, there'll probably be the best opportunity ever to get rid of them for some real BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-07 20:38:50


Some [companies]( try to take over bitcoin. Their first plan was to change BTC protocol rules in such a way that their Segwit2x would become the new BTC which would then be under their control firing the bitcoin core developers.
Now they obviously implement a (weak) replay protection so that when the fork happens, a new altcoin B2X will be created (like Bitcoin cash was). Nevertheless you have to pay attention on how to securely split and transact your BTC and your new B2X after the split. 


A new altcoin was created, see above.


No. 


Block 949784, likely around November, 18.


Have BTC (own the private keys like within paperwallet, hardware wallet, some software wallet). Most likely their'll be a B2X Airdrop similar to when bitcoin cash was created to all who own bitcoin.  
@_date: 2018-07-26 23:44:37
There are bout 32 millions of millionaires in the world. But there will never be more than 21 millions of BTC. That's why not even every millionaire in the world will ever own a whole bitcoin. Bitcoin fairly distributed among all existing people on our planet would mean about 0.0028 BTC for everyone. Just wanted to say. So owning 0.1 BTC wil be more than enough. It's about 30 times more than fair distribution would lead to.

Electrum is damn secure, especially if you use it as cold storage.   
It takes a little more effort, but imho it's more secure than a hardwarewallet, where you have to trust the company behind it to not have backdoors implemented.

In general I don't like the idea of interest and debt. That's why I love bitcoin; either your balance is positive or it's zero. Because in my opinion it shouldn't be possible to spend money you don't actually own. Interests mostly flows only in one direction. Finally it settles down in big bags and market liquidity dries out since they have no incentive to spend it anymore. That's why money printing presses run hot these days and normal folks like you and me suffer devaluation. Modern slavery. Sorry but this sucks.

Coins don't get lost in cyberspace. Check the receiving address using a blockchain explorer. Mostly I use this one  but there are also others. Checking your recieving address you should see the incoming transaction, also if your client doesn't show it yet.
@_date: 2019-09-10 17:56:36
Open the bitcoin core debug window. Look if there are outgoing connections. If yes, you're fine.
Bonus: Open port 8333 on your router and turn your non-listening fullnode into a listening one that way. Then you'll also see incoming connections and actively distribute (parts of) your blockchain data with new fullnodes joining the network.

I wouldn't do that since they are part of the NYA. Worst case is you end up with only owning B2X in the amount of BTC you owned before the split. Get your coins outta there and keep them on a paperwallet or hardware wallet!

If the funding sum is sufficient (at least 475 BTC + 4.75 BTC reward) the ad will be placed, if it's insufficient, anbody gets their funds back but 1 percent of anybody's funds remain for the winner of the ad competition anyway.

I know what you feel. I also want those who are near me to be part of this fantastic evolution. But I involved only a really few people to come on bord, all of which is just my family and one of my best friends. Sometimes I talk about it with other "friends" as well but I don't want to talk anybody into becoming one of us. I see us, the early adopters, as privileged to have gotten it that early but to share this knowledge and being really shouldn't have the priority. Everybody will *get it* someday, but I must admit, I thought big guys are those who get it last though I also see normal people who obviously try to *not getting it* very hard. That's regrettable but that's the way it is. Don't let bitcoin change your friendships. They are more important than the evolution of world-changing technologies as they are unavoidable anyway and don't need common caring; while friendship does.

I don't know either the first or second workaround but my guess: if you generate a receive address with a specific amount of btc to retrieve, a fitting qr code (and bitcoin address) will be generated, which you can scan with the wallet software that has the private key for your address to quickly send the right amount to the right address. I would just send the correct amount manually from your wallet software that has your private key to your new wallet (and address).

Storing bitcoin on exchanges is obviously the most stupid thing you can do: There's always the risk of hacks, confiscations, capital controls, hair cuts and exit scams. As long as you're not in control of the private keys it's actually *not your funds*. If only you alone are in control of the wallet and thus in pure control of the keys. Then it's your funds.
@_date: 2015-09-15 06:00:47
Okay. But what, if btc values not around 250 as does but around let's say 250 000. Then, the fee probably wasn't around 0.00001 btc but around 0.00000001 btc which equals just 1 Satoshi. Just a guess. You know what I mean? So then, the fee's year rate wouldn't be 17 000 000 but just around 17 000 btc, and that's not much compared to your supposed market flow.

Anyone being able to run an own fullnode is also not as stupid as to do mentioned things above. Anyone who cares just a little about system security doesn't do those stupid things for long time already, it's common sense.

Once bitcoin sees $500kish figures, volatility will have been decreased drastically. By that time lightning will have evolved to a standardized online payment system.

You make some very weird assumptions that show you don't know what bitcoin is about.
Some points: 
- Making bitcoin illegal: You cannot ban bitcoin. It will always be there, if you like it or not. Making it illegal equals admitting the current system could fail and could deeply be disrupted by bitcoin. That is the best promotional campaign that bitcoin could ever have. So. Major states out of exactly that reason won't try to make bitcoin illegal.
- Inflation: The only reason it exists is to make sure money eventually always flows in the same direction: Into big pockets, big companies, heads of them, banks. It's always been like that. Only three out of all world's central banks are *not* under control of Rothschild (look it up). The money flow *always* ends in this pocket. Inflation is just their tool of secret dispossession. Bitcoin being deflationary will solve that problem.
- Slaves: 99% of all human beings are already slaves in case you missed that. Not just '10%'. Very likely you are also one of them. In case you missed that.
- Gold: Today nobody really knows how much of it exsists. Price is *made* by banks, not really by demand and supply. Everything is based on suppositions. It's hard to talk about scarcity out of that reason. At latest when men will be able to harvest gold from asteroids and the likes: Say goodbye to its scarcity.
- Economic growth: I don't think economy has to grow and grow and grow. It's only growing in the past 150 years because of over-production and unreflective waste of resources. That will end one day when it gets clear nobody wants to have all those over-produced products. Companies will and have to go bankrupt for natural economic cycles. There shouldn't be ongoing bailouts for companies and banks which anyway are always paid by the people, the slaves, the taxpayers.
Bitcoin will solve all those problems. It's the first of its kind people's money. Hard money. Sound money. The coming years we will see the biggest wealth transfer back into that hands of people. And I am really looking forward to it.

2fa is a method of double securing an  online account. Beside a username and password you use a software like authy or google authenticator (etc) on a separated device (smartphone, tablet...), which is time synced to the net and generates exclusive (for your eyes only) 6-digit numerous code for example every minute which you have to enter to log into your account. If I am not wrong, it's even end to end encrypted. It's a good thing!

What is *it*, you're talking about?
@_date: 2015-09-07 22:34:42
Sorry. But I suppose they are lost. For the future and all other newbies: make sure you got the private key BEFORE   sending bitcoins there!
@_date: 2015-09-01 19:14:33
True. It can also be seen like that. But cryptographic aspect should be asked for, as it's an important key aspect.
@_date: 2015-09-02 18:04:34
While I frequently go on checking the node versions I see my supposition confirmed: the amount of XT versions is still decreasing...

Very clear: if have bitcoin  when the fork happens, you will only have segwit2x-coins once the fork is done. So: Avoid using all services who support the fork and stay in control of your btc always owning the private keys.

Nope. Satoshi is a cryptography expert  and thus is as well able to take all required measurements to stay anonymous forever. So killing himself/herself wouldn't have been necessary. But imo it's very likely he destroyed all of his keys. Just in case...
@_date: 2018-04-24 11:13:41
Which will most likely be upwards...
@_date: 2019-09-29 14:13:01
Exactly this. But most people are not aware of this and think 'Damn. $8000 per BTC. That is extremely expensive'. But it's not. It's ridiculously cheap.

I'd stay at CEX. They will support both chains and list bitcoin as BTC and segwit2x as B2X, ASAIK. So they do better than coinbase and GDAX and you're more secure. For mid and long term storage don't leave your coins on any exchange. Store in a way where you alone control your keys.
@_date: 2018-04-25 11:29:02
Nonsense. Bitcoin is already a commodity. If at all the whole thing turns around altcoins and tokens.
@_date: 2018-04-26 21:23:30
There is only one trustworthy crypto. That's bitcoin. Best wallets are securely paperwallets as well as hardware wallets like trezor or ledger. Regarding coinbase: It's just a bank and completely misses the point of the main concept which is caring for the keys *oneself* to be truly sovereign. Use bisq to buy bitcoin, it's the most advanced decentralized p2p exchange.  Regarding mobile wallets: always make sure to use open source wallets to not get scammed eventually. Hope that helped. Happy hodling.

If you're not in a hurry you can set fees quite low. 
Often trxs with fee $0.10 and below are actually confirmed quite quickly. But even less is possible if you're not in a hurry. Doing 10 trxs and learning the stuff that comes with it is certainly worth a dollar, isn't it?

Andreas Antonopoulos on that topic: 
@_date: 2016-10-18 13:25:39
I had a similar problem: Goods were held by customs. Contacted the seller. He proposed to wait a few days to see if the order goes out the customs. Few days later I checked that. Still held by customs. Contacted the seller. He contacted the moderator for refunding me. One or two days later I got an incoming payment at my refunding address (and I was not online in OB for that). So it worked. (But since I'm not a moderator I don't know how he did that but again: for me it worked).
@_date: 2018-04-15 11:39:54
I bet he was smart enough to destroy all his keys so those funds wouldn't ever go in the wrong hands. At least that's what I would have done being Satoshi.
@_date: 2018-04-21 22:06:15
Not possible. Otherwise they wouldn't even mention bitcoin. Bad publicity is also publicity supporting the network effect.
@_date: 2018-04-13 10:47:32
Most HD wallets are based on BIP32 which defines a standard for key derivation mostly using BIP39 which offers a list of 2048 words to be used as a seed (12,18,24 words). *Your* combination of words is *one* out of 2048^n (where n is the amount of words your seed consists of). So wallets using this 'standard method of derivation' can manage your seed. That's all I know. Yeah, perhaps I don't understand your question.

The sender could double spend the coins to a different address, using different methods. Also it's possible that if your fee is way too low, the transaction could get dropped by the network. That would happen at the earliest after 14 days (default setting bitcoin qt) when nodes decide to clear the ram-consuming never-being-processed-transactions.

Even if I marked *my* 24 words italic, the chance you get it in the right order is ridiculously little: Even if you had a computer being able to calculate 1 billion seed combinations per second, which you haven't because such one doesn't even exist, you would need about 19.7 millions of years to compute all possibilities.

In the end bitcoin will be way more stable than the dollar. Bitcoin's inflation rate will decrease to less than 1%, probably anywhere around just 0.75% percent within the next ten years. Another eight years and we'll have just around 0.18% inflation rate, further decreasing. All of this happening under increasing adoption follwed by rising prices. The result could be a very valuable, trustworthy and stable coin. Again, reminds a bit of gold.

Right. But it's a nice indicator of how attracting bitcoin is.


Yes. Once bitcoin is less volatile. It'll be easier then to value everything in BTC without having heavy changing prices all the time. My guess is, it'll be anywhere around $500k per BTC when first effects of saturation could come into effect with volatility getting minimal. Bitcoin would by theoretical market cap equal that of gold by then.

Maybe. But at these times most people know that maths and computer things actually work and they are able to admit that it's just their lack of understanding of *how* it works exactly. They trust in things, even if they don't understand them, when others trust in it as well and as long as there's no bigger flaw, which would obviously decrease trustworthiness. And why not: One doesn't have to understand the underlying technology just to be using it. Thus it's so important to always grant quality and simplicity in user experience. When people see it's working and bringing plenty of benefits with it, I am quite sure they'll rather follow the logics of maths if they have the decision.

Of course you are right. So here are the measurements I took to have a complete offline machine:
- installed a completely fresh OS on a bootable USB drive
- took an old notebook, went into BIOS and deactivated any network related devices such as network adapter, wifi and bluetooth
- additionally switched off the wifi hardware button on the notebook, just to be sure
- booted from prepared USB drive (see above) finished the OS setup process
- uninstalled any network regarding driver
- checked that there aren't any online connections, just to be sure
- setup (pgp-verified) electrum version I transfered to the machine via USB
That's it. Imho doing it that way is quite secure, in any case I don't see a single point of failure. But you are right! It's essential the OS never went online nor it will ever be online.

? I don't see, where you get that information from. I see the following: In about 12 months bitcoin will be at $10k worst case, best case about $35k. When the halving occurs, it should be at least at $35k, best case would be around $100k. That's in about two years and a little. One year later, in mid 2021, worst case scenario is bitcoin around $100k. Just the interpretation of the graph, not necessarily my opinion.

Solving this problem is sooo simple, just
1) Buy (commodity), then   
2) Hodl (store of value), then   
3) Spend (medium of exchange).   
As more and more people do so, bitcoin will render from commodity to store of value to medium of exchange.  Mission accomplished. When bitcoin reaches its true value imo at least about $500k per BTC, on its way there manipulation will decrease significantly.

Maybe. Nevertheless this is way more time consuming and there is no way to  validate that addresses from the seed eventually equal those from the wallet. I prefer doing it offline and having some more options when creating.

That doesn't work anyway, since the last word is a checksum of the previous ones and there's (almost) no chance to generate a valid seed that way.
If you want to generate damn secure seed, do the following.
- Head to  and just save the website onto a usb drive for offline usage.
- Download and burn any linux live system onto another USB drive or CD, I use Ubuntu live system.
- Unplug network cable and shut down your router!
- Boot the live linux system, plug in USB drive with downloaded Ian-Coleman Website and open it with any webrowser
- Tick *Show entropy details* after that choose desired seed length below *Mnemonic length* (I always generate 24 word seeds)
- Throw a dice *one hundred times* and enter each throw in the belonging textbox.
- Copy your created seed carefully by writing in down and safe it securely, at best not in digital form.
- Copy the first bitcoin address shown below for validation purposes later on.
- Shutdown Linux, remove USB drives/CD.
- Start your desired wallet (that supports 24 word seed) and choose *restore* wallet instead of creating a new one.
- Enter your fresh 24 seed words. If that works and there's no error message, you can be sure to have generated a valid seed. Verify that the first receiving address matches the one written down a few step above. If they match you're fine.
- Done. You now have a seed that is damn secure as it doesn't rely on any RNG (random number generator) but got its entropy from a truely random process, just throwing a dice.

Right. Any funds on any bank account can be seized anytime, erazed to *zero* and you can't do anything about it. If you cashed your trx out before that, fine.

You really use a service you described above? I wouldn't use those kinds. But if you do so, always remember: a bitcoin transaction is never reversible.

@_date: 2016-05-16 22:04:19
So you make a profit of 310-187=123/Month (2xS7). After halving you'll have a loss of 22/Month. If you bought another two S7, your reward would have been 620-187=433/Month and after the halving you'd have been where you are now. How much were the two S7?...to finish the calculations...

If you have a second ledger device you can try to recover your seed onto that one (because your first ledger is perhaps broken). I did this process directly after generating the seed to make sure recovering works. I send the funds first, after I checked the seed and propose everyone to do so too.

Initialize the device. Backup the seed. Look for the first public key on your trezors HD Wallet, copy the qr code or write down the public key. Visit an ATM. Buy the coins and let the ATM send it to your QR-Code or enter the wallet address. Done.

To spam the mempool you don't need to pay the average fee, it can be chosen much lower. But nevertheless if you have e.g. 300k btc (which is told about Ver for example, or your control big mining pools like Jihan does), you can afford to invest in such strategies to drive to fees up and flood the pool.

Okay. Hold on. I just gonna buy some coins.
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:26:50
I am into bitcoin for about three and a half years and I observed the mempool, almost daily. If you look at the mempool tx count history you can see that there are often unexplainable sudden spikes which are followed by a smaller or bigger timeframe, in which mempool is quite crowded (by ongoing spamming keeping that up). Similarly sudden, the tx count falls and falls again, until it is below 10k, sometimes even almost zero. Seems a bit too much of coincidence. If a crowded mempool would be caused by mainstream adoption, I wouldn't expect those sudden movements but a steady growth. I don't have proof but I'd also do so if I had money and wanted to enforce a blocksize increase as scaling solution to earn even more profits (from fees).

I saw so many "corrections" and have never ever sold a bitcoin. Thus I send the coins to my wallet and hodl immediately after buying them. If you want risk and trade them (what's risky in my opinion since you'll never know if you get another entry point) IMHO you can easily keep them on your trading account for "the next correction" to sell as well. I consider it the same risk as trading them at all.

Okay. Agreed.
@_date: 2017-07-27 12:13:00
That means your transaction is posted into the mempool but not yet processed. It is processed, if a miner includes your transaction into a mined block. That happens approximately every ten minutes so depending on your set fee your transaction will be processed sooner or later. A nice site to view mempool stats and block processing is  Check it out.
@_date: 2016-05-28 13:40:30
Actually you buy and sell at the same time, so there is nearly no risk of time-lagging. But therefore you need a bit more background capital. The risk of not being paid of course remains.

This isn't completely true: All software that runs on ledger is open source and you can view all the code on github.  But ledger uses a 'secure element', which is a micro controller that ensures a secure environment. The chip is called St31 and its architecture is indeed closed source. Such chipsets are certificated 'security standards' used for stuff like credit cards, usb dongles (kind of security key) and so on. Afaik they're manufactured by a separate enterprise and not by ledger itself. Using ledger nano you principally trust a third party, whereas trezor (and afaik also keepkey, derivated from trezor) is completely open source. I myself use ledger HW1, nano and nano s and I like them. The nano s has a lot of great features like different alts beside bitcoin, a screen and hardware buttons, a great and quick support, style, use as fido second factor authentication, and an ongoing development. In the end it's a matter of taste, as all three conventional hardware wallets are a bit different in style and possibilities and I think all of them are very secure.

The wallet manages all addresses for you and always shows your whole coin amount available, thus the summed up amount of all your addresses. No amount should be missing there, right? So no funds are missing. If you use a second application to "watch only" an address, maybe this watched adress is empty now. That's because your wallet manages shifting coins forth and back itself (creating new return addresses and so on). You can, for "watching purposes" send all your funds to one and only address, but that costs money. To do that, as I said above, send the whole wallet amount to your most recent adress (which is shown if you click on "recieve"). I propose you to get a ledger nano s and use mycelium wallet to "watch" your coins. The ability to sync the ledger nano s with mycelium makes the "watching" process very easy since mycelium also always "knows" about all addresses used by the ledger. If that doesn't help I think I missed your point.

Afaik the initial decision was two months ago, not two weeks. But nevertheless: Maybe they thought, bitcoin would crash depending on their  decision, but it did not, the opposite is the case. Maybe some potentially big investors are now very insecured on the matter cause mainstream media is celebrating bitcoin in the meantime. That could eventually be a reason for revisioning their decision.

Even if SHA256 could be broken by quantum computers: 1) You are only at risk if you reuse addresses (and then only if you receive **and** send from it, multiple sole recievings not affected as well) and 2) Bitcoin is easily upgradable to quantum resistance, if that becomes necessary.

I assume you use a HD Wallet which always generates new address after sending or receiving funds. There is no money lost. It's on the old address which is still part of your wallet. If you need all funds on one address, easily send your max amount of money to the most recent address of your own wallet. But remember you'll have to pay tx fee therefore. In general this is not necessary, cause as I said: No funds should be lost. Also the reuse of "old" addresses is possible.

By either letting the ATM
a) send you the funds into your wallet (mycelium, samourai, green wallet or whatever) directly by giving it your address or 
b) importing/sweeping the paperwallet given by the ATM into the wallet you use.

Not continuously if you run the node in pruned mode.


It can't get out of control unless blocksize is raised and even then you can always do the math. Bitcoin is 10 years old, blocksize grew to 200 gigs. Let's assume the blocksize increase due to segwit would have been quadrupled the growth (which didn't even happen); next 5 years bringing it to additional 400 gigs, resulting in 600 gigs for 2024 is still laughable and would easily be doable.
So if the blocksize wouldn't be raised, we would hit the 1 Tbyte in minimum about 10 years, if not later.

The thing is for bitcoin to become a reasonable medium of exchange it has to be much less volatile, meaning market liquidity has to increase! Let it increase by factor 100 to 200 from here, then you can expect bitcoin to be a (more) stable currency as well as a good store of value. Higher prices are inevitable on the path of bitcoin to become the world currency.
Tl;dr: Higher prices=higher liquidity=lower volatility=stable currency/store of value.

About 180,000 tons of gold have ever been mined. That's 180 million kilo. There are just 21 million bitcoin so if you invest in gold and buy just 1 kilo, it's exactly the same as buying about  0.111 btc. I have to admit, 0.111 btc don't move the market but neither 1 kilo of gold does. So. Why not just buying 0.111 btc, which equals 1 kilo of gold? IMHO it's a good beginning for everyone.

In general I prefer doing things manually. Forget about "sweeping". Import the private key and send your desired amount to a desired address. That's how I always do it, and it works. As you can see, someone knew better, what sweeping is, so I may have been wrong with my explanation. Do it manually and it's done.

Running a full node is the only way of using bitcoin as it is meant to be. The only way of not having to trust a third party. Not for bitcoin's past (because while syncing the blockchain you validate every transaction which has ever occurred yourself) nor for bitcoin's present (because you propagate your transactions yourself without having to rely on anyone else's node and verify the validity of new blocks and new transactions yourself). 
Some mobile wallets then allow you to connect to your own node to achieve the same privacy and sovereignty while on the go. In my view everbody should consider running an own fullnode. Decentralization would definitely benefit of it!

There are a lot of good exchanges. But not all of them will work for your, as it depends on where you are located.


When your want to buy *real* bitcoin, the exchange *must* offer the option to "withdraw bitcoin". Looking at [the regarding section of uphold's faq]( I would guess that it's indeed possible.
You get in control of the keys once you withdraw your coins to an own wallet you have to download and setup. The setup process involves writing down 12 to 24 words (and storing them securely). *Do that conscientiously!* It is the backup of your coins for the case anything happens to your wallet / device.
Once you have set the wallet up you can withdraw your coins from uphold to one of your wallet's addresses. That's it.
@_date: 2018-12-09 18:36:03

Import the private key into mycelium. Send the complete amount to your trezor receiving address. Keep bcash on the paperwallet. Sending bcash right now will result in also sending bcashsv (fork of bcash, occurred on 2018/11/15) as there is still no native replay protection implemented.

Gold may be a nice store of value. In the end bitcoin will be the better store of value.

Give it another 5 years.

Keep in mind: Trading options isn't the same as owning bitcoin. It's the same as if you bought a certificate on gold instead of gold itself. It's worthless if the issuer decides it is. With bitcoin you can be sure it's worth what the whole world is willing to pay for it. And Bitcoin is very scarce. There are only about 17.5 million bitcoin in existence as of now and there will never ever be more than 21 million as a whole. So better think twice whether you want to own shitty worthless paper bitcoins or real ones accepted anywhere.

When the whole things breaks together, everyone flees in the last surviving store of value, so that it's value goes "to the mooooon". Everybody is happy, having enough of wealth and freedom. But the bad guy wants to see all human beings in slavery, so he tries to manipulate the markets with his earliest coins, trying to make everybody having nearly nothing. But he fails, not enough coins. In the end they get him, and everybody is happy again, cause the created crypto currency lives on and on and on as a matured store of value AND digital currency to pay with!

You should start diving a bit into the matter, maybe before you come on board. This is a great site to start with.  Especially the videos by Andreas Antonopoulos are recommended for beginners, as he's able to explain bitcoin related stuff very well, also for beginners. The mentioned site as well gives you some information on how to buy bitcoin.
Some things to consider in general: Always buy bitcoin on exchanges, where it's possible to withdraw it to an own wallet! Never store funds on exchanges longer than needed because they are vulnerable to hacks or confiscations, which you probably don't want! Always use wallets which are open source and thus reviewed by a lot of people. This way you decrease the possibility of losing your funds. Try to withdraw your bitcoin immediately after purchasing them, because *not your keys, not your coins*. The sidebar to the right also gives you good entry points of looking for good wallets and exchanges. Hardware wallets like ledger or trezor can be securely used with computers and you actually don't need a mobile therefor. One last thing: Despite the fact that bitcoin already exists for 10 years, it's still in its childhood. No one knows where the journey is heading so don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
Hope that helps. Welcome to bitcoin. Welcome to freedom and true financial sovereignty.

Always make sure there's the option to withdraw the bitcoin you will have purchased to an own wallet! If that's not possible you will very likely buy *fake bitcoin which have no value*. Something that has no value can easily be insured. That's way coinbase funds aren't insured completely. They deal with real bitcoin. As I said: Forget about insurance, choose an exchange with the ability to withdraw. After every purchase withdraw your coins at best to a hardwarewallet (like trezor or ledger).
As for fidelity: Check if withdrawing bitcoin is possible. If it's not, **do not use it!**

There isn't one, but thousands of "blockchains", private regrettably, simply put databases, which don't have a common protocol. Compatibility is not algorithmized, meaning user "intervention" is "needed" to keep the system together and working. Agreements between two parties/people often decide on the fate of many people.
Blockchain (where the only true is bitcoin's) is quite different. In fact the complete opposite. 
The ledger is entire. A consensus protocoll is agreed upon between the majority of parties. No "intervention" needed nor possible. Vires in numeris.

Bitcoin usage as a whole seems to be very difficult to understand to many people. That has to change *before* multisig goes mainstream as it's still harder to understand. So for now focus lies on teaching basics and bringing regular bitcoin user experience closer to the people.

The velocity of adoption is self-regulating. Bitcoin doesn't have to be "implemented" in more mainstream markets to gain traction. Those who like the idea will turn to bitcoin anyway. And the more issues come regarding the global economic and financial situation the more people/companies/institutions/govs will prefer to be using bitcoin for secure, censorship-resistant transmission of funds but as a reliable store of wealth in the first place. Bitcoin follows a long term idea and cannot be forced to do something. By participating you'll learn patience. Which is good.
Regarding your issues: To fair, there aren't really a lot of them. The existing ones are being addressed continously and time has shown that developmental decisions which have been made turned out to have positive results
It's not that issues aren't discussed here, as you can see if you look through history of threads.
But some people simply don't know how to use language or don't want to but then wonder why they are not being heard. Also there are some topics where the truth is it's already solved. But some people repetitively try to address the these same 'issues' again and again and again so that it's getting boring for those who have already accepted the ever evolving character of bitcoin.
You're welcome to participate and have *constructive* debates.

Ah. Think I got it. The payment which is to be recieved first proceeds to an address where you hold the keys, you cut off a little profit for your "service" and process the remaining funds to the merchant, correct? But then it's you being the 3rd party involved with a closed source application which takes some nice profits and has to be trusted, no? I don't know if that's a good and sustainable idea. If it was open source (and thus non-profit with it)...but then again there's BTCPay with LN integration.

2¹²⁸ = 340.282.366.920.938.000.000.000.000.000.000.000.000


1 out of 340.282.366.920.938.000.000.000.000.000.000.000


Let’s say that we have a super-fast computer that scans the entire blockchain within 1 second and checks if we hit it, then we can calculate that we are busy for 10,790,283,070,806,000,000,000,000 years to hit one of the billion wallets that are in use.

The real bitcoin works with lightning while any papershit wouldn't. So considering lightning's increasing adoption, it'll be difficult in the end to sustainably flood the market with fake bitcoin.   
Plus bitcoin's fundamentals are easy verifiable for everyone so doing that would be noticed anytime soon. And then when SEC calls for transparency and measurements against manipulation, if find it's up to them to care for any institutions not giving out such fake shit, cause it's clear that by doing so the market *would* be prone to manipulation and such. *If* it's got to be regulated, shall they create a legal framework including every obvious consideration (blockchain stats) there is to let a secure asset remain as clean as possible.

The 'rebirth' of bitcoin was certain all the time. Big fishes were already aware of the power of bitcoin since end 2017 at the latest but many of them had missed the train. Now they would let it bleed out as far as possible so that even the strongest hands would get weak and rather sell at loss than 'go to zero'. But it turned out $3k would be the bottom and soon as this was certain, a lot of the big money from the sidelines stepped in, as pioneers of the 'institutional wave'. But the rise would have to be of a sudden so that all the normal folks would if at all get just the tiniest piece of the cake and would be too afraid to enter at recent 'high' prices at all.
I expect the rise to go on faster than most of us think, just to diminish the group of bitcoin owners who otherwise would be to wealthy and have too much power one day. My theory so far.

Isn't it that with revolut you cannot withdraw your Bitcoin? With revolut you don't own real bitcoin (which to me means having the ability to control the coins). You cannot get in control of them. Sell whatever shit you bought and head over to a real bitcoin exchange where you buy real bitcoin and store them in using a hardware wallet like ledger or trezor.

Ah okay. So you're running out of lifetime. I am sorry to hear that.

See ya (at the other side one day).
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:24:03
So the whole thing is actually very good for bitcoin distribution. Many more people will have the ability to get in cheap. The sentiment begins to turn when there are enough people not willing to sell (that low or at all) and they cut off the supply. With increasing demand due to expectation and education about bitcoin and almost zero liquidity in the market the price will rise again. That's when the miners will begin going long pushing the price to new highs.
Edit: One interesting thing to add is that the halving will have an even bigger impact on bitcoin's price from this perspective. Getting only half the reward by then makes it more reasonable to reduce the shortings. Or take a higher risk.

Coinbase is anti-bitcoin as shown with its heavy involvement in the segwit2x drama, along with Shapeshift, where those and further companies attempted to hostile take-over bitcoin about a year ago.

Big corporations drive the price down and try to shake as much weak hands out as possible. Once they cannot compete with the increasing buy pressure anymore they will change their attitude. That must imho very likely run into a sudden quite strong rebounce. To avoid many average Joes getting back in again, they will buy quickly driving the price in a big manner.

Nice idea. I enter a site, register anonymously with a desired "username" and assign one or more public keys.  Somehow I have to prove that I am the owner of that or these addresses and once it's done you, as sender can do the following: You enter my username and get my public key/s. You pick one, enter the amount you want to send and get a bitcoin address (public key) via qr code (including the amount you want to send).
This one has just to be scanned via desired wallet app, and voila; send. Anything I have missed? Beside that there are some security risks (integrity of service, vulnerability and so on). But the main idea should be working, not?
Edit: That would also be possible via p2p clients carrying that library, not?

You buy at an ATM and send to Coinbase wallet? A bit silly as you give up the privacy you achieve when buying at atms. Next time you purchase bitcoin at an atm send to a wallet where *you* control the keys. Regarding your problem: you can look up the transaction id the atm gave you in a block explorer to examine the fee the atm put to send the funds to your wallet. It was likely too less to get the transaction processed more quickly. That means you have to be a bit more patient to get your tx confirmed at coinbase wallet.

He does understand the purpose of bitcoin. That's why he's bashing it his last days. Better resting in peace without having lost face. Lagarde on the other hand gets it. She admitting bitcoin is indeed disruptive tells a complete different story than old dinosaurs at their last supper.

Well. That's quite funny. It has taken years and years to implement such an (instant) payment system although from technical view it could have very likely been done years ago.

Bitcoin doesn't care *at all* about shitcoins. Why should that change now? Also consider bitcoin to be a device for a peaceful revolution which doesn't want to attack anyone. It just doesn't care about shitcoins, ignores them completely and has no incentive to 'take over' any of them. They will disappear once the majority has understood their uselessness.

Altcoin="Alternative coin". Anything that is not bitcoin but claims to be a cryptocurrency. None of them are viable "alternatives". Their network is never as secure as the bitcoin network and almost all of them are quite easy to attack and vulnerable to price manipulations.

Miners 'finding' a new block currently get 12.5 bitcoin as reward which makes kind of bitcoin's inflation rate, the fresh supply. Right now it is about 3.8% per year. Approximately every four years this reward gets cut in half (='halving'). Next halving will occur in about 11 months. New reward then will be 6.25 bitcoin per mined block resulting in a new inflation rate of about just 1.9% for the coming four years until halving in 2024.

That's interesting. Probably the seller doesn't want to contact specifically you. How I know that? Because of how pgp works. There's a public key which let's the sender encrypt a message, the recipient owns the private key he can decrypt the message with. That means that pgp only works, if the recipient (which is you in that case) provided a public pgp key beforehand.

Sorry but you're wrong. Ethereum is hyped right (mostly by industrial players) now and soon the bubble will pop. It's politics is everything else than bitcoin's. It's not a store of value, it's inflationary and the next exploit which leads to losing people a shitload of money will cause the biggest drop, ethereum has ever seen. Litecoin on the other hand could be bitcoin's big follower. It's the second oldest and thus truely matured crypto. Transactions are blazing fast and it has segwit already implemented which will lead to lighting networks being established soon. Forget ethereum. If you really want to hedge bitcoin (which is not necessary IMHO) choose litecoin. Remember my words.

There is no risk if you only put in what you can afford to lose.


First mover advantage with outstanding network effect and most secure crypto network outthere. In the end bitcoin has the highest gains as every altcoin is just a speculative pump and dump. 


Get a wallet where you control the keys! Don't go in all at once but make a plan on how much you put in on regular basis, weekly or monthly (=dca, dollar cost averaging). After buying bitcoin immediately transfer it to your own wallet. Otherwise you face different risks (exchange hacks, confiscations, exit scams) which can easily be avoided this way.   
If an offer sounds too good to be true, don't fall for it. It's most likely a scam!
Also don't freak out on roller-coaster, stay calm and hodl (that's the hardest one). Have fun!

If I understand correctly you could: store your coins on any HD Wallet or private key that you own. After August, 1st, import your seed or private keys into a wallet that supports the "other" coin.

@_date: 2018-12-18 20:32:57
They don't get anything. Whether or not they implement "blockchain-technology" won't solve the actual economical nor monetary problems as it would still be badly centralized, controlled by only a few and there's still this censorship-irresistance. Bitcoin will solve those problems and eventually wipe the rest completely out and suck it off. It is the monetary systems' black hole gaining its power by being the most trustless and decentralized asset.
@_date: 2019-05-29 13:44:11
Yep. That works because it's worthless.
@_date: 2019-05-25 07:38:13
BTC is way more hardened than bcash and not comparable at all in these regards. Bcash is just a shitcoin and no one cares if it is attacked or whatsoever.   
Bitcoin on the other hand has about 35 times the hashrate bcash has. So attacking it is not that easy.   
Also miners didn't invest millions into hardware, infrastructure, staff, facility, electricity just to render their hoarded coins and their complete business worthless and useless. So even if they could, they wouldn't do so. Furthermore there are mechanisms to defend such attacks. Andreas Antonopoulos on that topic: 
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:19:16
Looking at your comment history suggest you're just a little shady crypto trader involved in pumps and dumps. You should have been keeping your BTC instead of trolling around right now. Over and out.

I see it as an on-boarding mechanism. It should be clear to you that we are not yet there and that it'll take some years still. Banks opening up for bitcoin is actually a good thing. I far as I understand, it's also an exchange where you can quite easily (but with a premium) buy bitcoin and also transfer the funds to your wallet.

Most of the users lost a shitload of money, if not more than that. If they had come for the technology instead of the price they wouldn't have lost more than they could have afforded to lose.

I understand that you don't like the idea of USD crashing. You're comment history shows you're kind of "investor", a little fish, sure but anyway. I'd advise you to better get comfortable with the potential scenario of fiat collapsing.
Nothing has changed since 2008, even more things got far worse. Buying bitcoin is not investing. It's escaping the biggest pyramid schemes of all times which *is* about to enter death spiral and will collapse anytime soon. Just do some research and you'll find many proponents for the happening of such "apocalyptic" scenario. Better don't fool yourself. Things change at the moment...
If you're ready for some education on that topic, about half an hour of your lifetime would be well "invested" into Andreas Antonopoulos (about worlds banking cartels and what bitcoin might have to do with it):

Sorry for my caution, I did not want to degrade your work since its a nice idea. Three things to get it working right away: Move your site to https supporting servers, open/link your source code and let users import their own recieving addresses. Nevertheless there will still be the chance of a hack, where somebody tries to replace user recieving addresses with their ones. That'll be the biggest problem to solve.

As long as there are two chains after the chain split, you theoretically hold both coins. Bitcoin experts, am I wrong?
@_date: 2019-05-18 15:49:18
No. Because it either means the coins are not accessible anymore (due to loss of keys) resulting in a dramatically decreased total supply or the coins are considered not worth to be moved at those ridiculous price levels. In my view it's likely for about 4 million of those bitcoin the former is true, while the other 6 million coins are not moved because of the latter.

No. Look at the charts. Rule of thumb is bitcoin is skyrocketing within 6 months after each halving.

That's right. But take a look at the given addresses.

Anytime there'll then be somebody the first who suddenly don't give a damn about the agreement anymore and sells his coin. Others then follow. Goodbye value.


Yes, it's possible and I know how: Don't be Jihan. Wave your fuckin ego goodbye. That's how it'd work.

Stop recommending coinbase. If we want a solid bitcoin we have to avoid those monopolies and drive decentralization in every way! Otherwise we endanger it...

All I could find was illegalization made prices of drugs and alcohol rise along with common usage due decreased supply and the urge for the forbidden. Interesting, eh?

The truth is there *is* only one highly secure cryptocurrency. So why changing the slogan to risk losses due to propagation and conversation times? I am sure they'll get back to the original anytime soon.

The password selection does not affect seed generation. You get a different seed each time the device is reset. At least if you're device isn't compromised. If you wanna be sure choose a password, initialize the device. Then enter a wrong password three times in a row to automatically reset the device. Reinitialize the device with the same password. The seed words must be different now. If they are you're good to go.

Just wait a few years and live solely on bitcoin.
