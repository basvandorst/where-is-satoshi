This is a good analogy for any kind of physical money. The cloth on which dollars are printed isn't worth anything, but people are willing to give you nice stuff to get that piece of cloth. Same goes for the yellow pieces of metal held by gold owners. (Gold does have some industrial value, but that's far smaller than its exchange value.)
This isn't a good analogy for Bitcoin, because there is no physical token. It's all entries on a decentralized ledger, and there's nothing being "exchanged" back and forth during a transaction; it's just numbers changing on the ledgers. There's not even really a digital token either, and if there were it would just be data, and data isn't something that can be owned; it's not rivalrous.

You have a contract with the bank wherein they promise to punch buttons on their computer in a certain way (adding to your balance) in exchange for fiat currency, and they will give you fiat currency in exchange for punching buttons on their computer in the opposite way (subtracting from your balance). I don't believe you own their computers or their hard drives or their network cables or the electrons in any of those things. But they do have a contractual obligation to act as if that digital account were a stack of fiat currency that you own. We can treat the "contents" of the digital account as if you own them because the banking contract was formulated as a digital facsimile of physical objects in a vault.
I don't think the SR seizure was completely meaningless, but I also don't think it's a matter of "ownership of bitcoins". Because of how Bitcoin was constructed, wallets and bitcoins and private keys end up very closely resembling how we would treat gold coins in a personal safe, so it's convenient to talk about Bitcoin in terms used to describe legacy money systems like precious metals or fiat currency, wherein there is an actual physical token.
I don't know all the details of the seizure, but I imagine the feds trespassed on someone's computer and accessed it in an unauthorized manner (violating their ownership of the computer) and the result of that unauthorized access was a costly shift in opinion on the blockchain.
If we really wanted to bake property norms into Bitcoin, we could amend the protocol every time there is an unauthorized use of someone's Bitcoin address, thereby reverting the unauthorized change. As it stands, that seems to be contrary to the purposes of the Bitcoin network, which is to serve as an impartial messaging system for updating a value ledger.

I'm in favor of tort-based response to any of those attempts to fuck people over. If the people getting fucked have a problem with it, they should be able to file legal complaint and have it addressed.
Legislative regulation is by its very nature a third party dictating how people may interact. If the solution is in the victim's best interest, it wouldn't have to be legislated anyway; it could be established through tort and common law instead. Any regulation that can't be enacted through tort, but through legislation instead, is necessarily contrary to the interests of the victim.
When regulation is implemented through legislation, if a victim doesn't like how their problem is being regulated, they have virtually no legal recourse. The company victimizing them is, after all, following the law in most cases. Whenever there is some conflict between common law tort complaints and legislative regulation, I'll stand on the side of the victim's tort every time. And in the end, this doesn't really resemble "regulation" at all since it's not a bunch of lobbyist-backed politicians dictating the terms, but the actual people involved determining how the problem is resolved.

I agree. I don't believe bitcoins are ownable.

Given the multitude of industries which are controlled or influenced by the government, and the astronomically small chance a given individual has in influencing the outcome of an election, it's hardly just the uninformed people who choose not to show up for the vote. Anyone who analyzes the situation rationally will conclude that it's not worth the risk of the car accident on the way to the polling place, even if they are very well educated on the issues at stake. In some ways, elections disproportionate attract the blindly idealistic voters and those easily swayed by politicians' charismatic pleas to get out the vote.


Is it not acceptable to conclude that legislation over large populations is invalid?
Anyway, it doesn't really matter much whether legislation is "valid" or not. That's a matter of opinion that will vary from person to person. I'm just pointing out the *fact* that the democratic process is not a demonstration of consent or agreement. One may argue that consent of the governed is an impractical or unreasonable requirement, but that doesn't change the factual matter of whether consent has been given.


Unfortunately, I don't have much control over what "we are doing in a representative republic" for much of the same reasons that I am a rationally ignorant (non)voter. Instead I try to shape my community in [ways that bypass the consent of politicians](and most directly turn the peoples' consent into reality. You say that it's impractical to require the peoples' agreement to do things, while I am trying to make consensual social organization a reality.

Bull-fucking-shit. States are created when authoritarians declare sovereignty over others and threaten them with guns.

It's not the best example since there is probably an argument to be made for parental obligation due to their choice to have a child. The people who make up the Bitcoin exchange market never made any choice that could be construed as taking responsibility for the value of my Bitcoin portfolio.
The Bitcoin "price" isn't some tangible thing that can be damaged or destroyed. It's representative of offers to buy/sell Bitcoin. I don't "have" Bitcoins at a certain price, I just "have" Bitcoins period (and since there is no physical token, it's arguable whether I even "have" that), so nothing is being taken away from me if the price goes down.
If McDonald's increases the price of a Big Mac today, I might be put out that my dollars are now worth fewer Big Macs than what I expected them to be worth yesterday. McDonald's hasn't taken anything away from me though, so they haven't imposed a negative externality. They just changed their opinion of what kinds of transactions they will engage in.


Those managers and customers never agreed to maintain the price at any level, and they never agreed to change their business relationship to suit unrelated 3rd parties who have no stake in that relationship. I can understand how a 3rd party would want to enforce that obligation, just like 3rd parties can selfishly want others to do anything else that benefits them, but unless 3rd parties get to just arbitrarily impose obligations on others I vehemently disagree that MtGox and their customers have any obligation to the greater Bitcoin userbase.

Let's get one thing straight. No matter how difficult it is to get the things you want with purely voluntary funding, taking money from others to fund the things you want is *still stealing*. The only question remains is whether it's worthwhile to steal from others to fund the things you want. Having a group of politicians stand up on a pulpit with display a document (that they wrote) saying "We all agree that taxes should be paid" does not constitute consent of the people they claim authority over, and even if you write on a piece of paper that you may rob people, and then call that piece of paper a "constitution", the people you are robbing from still have not given consent, and you are still robbing them.


Is it worthwhile to force these people to pay when they would rather not? Is your opinion on how to utilize their money and resources really more valid than their opinion is?
I mean, maybe it really is worthwhile to do so. But let's be quite honest about what's happening here.
I think in the vast majority of cases, it won't be worth robbing others to pay for the things I want. However, I don't need politicians giving me orders regarding which situations are worth using theft and which are not. I'll decide for myself, thankyouverymuch.
Do you decide for yourself? Or do you mindlessly pay your tax money to politicians regardless of whether you agree with how they approach these problems? Do you believe it's your "duty" to keep paying? Or do you resent fact you are physically forced by the IRS to pay, and would you avoid paying at any chance you get whether legally or illegally? Why would you pay for something you don't agree with if you could get away with not paying?

The state is based on mandatory control. Bitcoin provides a means to bypass that control, and mandatory control doesn't work if people can bypass it.
Sure, a bunch of supporters of the state could use Bitcoin quite happily while conforming to state control. But a bunch of anarchists won't contentedly be controlled by the state when they have a clear means of avoiding that control.
It's a bit like saying that explosives and pickaxes are not inherently anti-prison, and that prisoners could quite easily use explosives and pickaxes in prison for uses other than escaping. Sure it's true, it's a logically possible thing to happen, but it completely ignores the social reality of the situation.

Bitcoin is similar to this with the public visibility of the accounts, but instead of declarations of changes in ownership, we have declarations of change in cryptographic control. The "ownership" is tied to a private key, not to a person.

I think you might be unclear on what a country *is*. What is it if not just a collection of individuals? How could a country have desires apart from the desires of its constituent individuals?
If "country" is merely defined as a collection of individuals, then there's no tension between what individuals need and what the country needs, since the two would be identical. If "country" is defined as anything separate from its constituent individuals, then it's merely imaginary; it doesn't exist.


It would certainly be interesting to see this kind of organization spring up, with contracts defining what each member's obligation is. Of course no state that has ever existed has taken this form; a state is not a contractual organization of its constituent members. Historically they have always been founded upon rules written by authoritarians, and unilaterally imposed on their subjects.

Humans currently tend to express a vestigial tribal instinct for deference to "authority". As long as that tendency to submit exists, there will be a complementary tendency of authoritarians to dominate and derive power from that submission.
However, individuals have the choice to ignore the authoritarian instinct and act independently. The more people who do that, the less power will be available for authoritarians to take advantage of, and as that happens we will start to see more of the kind of society that anarcho-capitalists envision.
I think you're certainly right that we'll need to see humans no longer acting "human", in the sense that they will need to cease deferring to authority (I think this has already started happening more than you seem to acknowledge). It's not that "humans must guide" so much as it is that humans have the opportunity to dominate when other humans submit. The enjoy an unchallenged power when no one challenges them.
I wouldn't say that deference to authority is a "problem" with anarcho-capitalism. It's just a fact of the social status quo, and leaving behind that vestigial instinct is a worthwhile goal to pursue.

American football is split into discrete plays. The offense has four chances to move the ball forward 10 yards. If they do that they get four new chances for the next 10 yards, and so on until they score or turnover.
The four chances are called "downs" because they last until the ball carrier is down. There's a time limit on how long the offense can take before they must start the next down. They usually use that time to organize a planned play to move the ball forward instead of the ad hoc strategy that happens in rugby and soccer.

I appreciate the question, thanks.
My opinion on the best political system would be an interesting discussion, but it's not what I want to focus on here. My objection is about the claim that government is something that has been agreed to by the people.
Politicians often make decisions that affect many people aside from those in their electoral district, so it can't be said that those people have agreed to the actions of the politician. Among the people in a politician's district, there are many that voted for someone else, so it can't be said that they agree. And there are yet more people who didn't even show up to vote, so it can't be said they agree. It doesn't stop there though, since none of the people involved were ever asked if they agree to the terms of the election in the first place.
Representative democracy in all its forms is no more than a way for people in power to give the people the illusion of control over the political process. And based on how many people insist that the people have agreed to the government's actions, it seems to be an effective deception.

At the risk of no-true-scotsmanning you...
The argument given for the "deflationary spiral" is that individuals would rather hold on to their money rather than spend it. It says nothing about whether the people who receive that money exchange it for other varieties of money, or whether they save/spend it. The argument is focused solely on whether an individual would ever spend instead of save a deflationary currency.
Not to mention the fact that when Overstock chooses to "buy" dollars through Coinbase with the bitcoins they receive, they are yet another example of someone willing to give up a deflationary asset for a non-deflationary one.
If the "deflationary spiral" argument were true, it would indicate a decrease in movement of deflationary assets for *any* reason, even merely as a component of a payment processing system.

Fairness doesn't matter. The fact that mining follows market dynamics and there is a cost to mining proportional to the mining reward that makes bitcoin tick.
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:35:50


The Fed doesn't have to spend money in proportion to the power they get from handing out their licenses (or keys, or whatever they use to signify their approval). ASIC farms do.
If for whatever reason, the actions of ASIC farms ends up destabilizing Bitcoin to the point where people take their money out of Bitcoin en masse, those ASIC farms will be left holding the bag after putting massive investment into their mining hardware and electricity supply. If the FED makes their own FEDcoin and distributes access keys to banks, they can spend as little as they want on the implementation since the network is limited access. So if no one shows up to use their system, or they initially attract users but later abuse the system and drive their users away, *shrug* who cares? They don't lose much money, certainly not in proportion to what ASIC farms would lose if Bitcoin were to die.


I don't believe it's the amount of capital required to enter the market that matters. I believe it's the risk of investment that secures Bitcoin against abuse, and the corresponding lack of risk on the Fed's part that would lead to abuse and security problems. ASIC farms have to invest money to make money, and their risk of investment is on par with their potential profit. Their profit also depends on the sustained demand of users who want to use Bitcoin, so they would be risking their own profits if they destabilized the system.

How is this a deterrent to a BU hard fork?
@_date: 2017-03-23 21:18:14
How many of today's miners would be significantly impacted by a blocksize increase to 10 MiB?
I doubt many of today's miners are running their internet traffic through Tor at 50 KiB/s, or even the "average" of 0.25 MiB/s. More likely they are running on 1 MiB/s or more, so adding 9 MiB to the block size would add about 9 seconds to the block propagation time, or about 1.5% of the 10 minute block rate. And that's with a conservative estimate of a miner's internet speed (any serious miner is going to have an order of magnitude more bandwidth than that) and a liberal estimate of blocksize (current transaction volume would require no more than 2-4 MB per block).
So even with exaggerated assumptions, this block propagation speed plays a negligible role in how effective miners are.
That's not even taking into account the incentives that miners have to maintain trust in the network by avoiding centralized mining pools. We've already seen how large mining pools will voluntarily break themselves up to maintain trust with the GHash.io event of 2014. It's certainly wise to monitor how pools behave with regards to centralization, but increasing the block size is no blank check for miners to centralize without repercussions. Centralizing mining always runs the risk of decreased public trust and decreased economic activity, leading to lower exchange rate and lower profits for those miners.
The scale of the incentives toward centralization are blown completely out of proportion by this argument, and the argument ignores all social incentives towards decentralization.
@_date: 2017-03-15 23:36:47


It should be obvious that a valid purpose is to expand block size and increase network throughput. You may not agree that such a purpose is the highest priority or even a good change, but there is ample evidence that many people actually want this block size expansion and see BU as a means to that end. This is a far more plausible purpose for the existence of BU than as an attack on Bitcoin, so it's rather reckless and irresponsible of you to ignore this obvious purpose and claim maliciousness.

Since a big part of Bitcoin's value proposition is its censorship resistance and decentralization, it's not as simple as the typical winner-take-all model of competition we're used to. If miners ever centralize excessively they will destroy the market they seek to control. Miners have to strike a balance between competition and decentralization if they want to maximize their profits.

Currently there are other cryptos that process transactions faster and cheaper than Bitcoin does. I know many people here do not place a high value on this aspect, but others do, and there's nothing disingenuous about doing so.
It's also a bizarre notion that promotion of one crypto is necessarily antagonistic towards other cryptos. Cryptocurrencies are competing not only against each other, but also against fiat currencies and traditional payment processors. If two cryptocurrencies both improve their features and network strength, they're liable to both grow relative to traditional monetary systems.

This is false. When more economic activity is attracted to Bitcoin, the "game" of mining grows. When economic activity leaves Bitcoin, the "game" of mining shrinks.

@_date: 2017-03-20 13:41:10
The value of Bitcoin is not in the nodes; it's in the miners. For a distributed consensus network to be trustworthy, users need to trust that the people running the network have more to gain by maintaining the network's integrity than they have to gain by falsifying transactions. For this to be the case, the network maintainers need to have significant monetary investment in the network. In the case of Bitcoin, this comes in the form of the money spent on ASICs and on the electricity to run them. If trust in Bitcoin is lost, that investment is rendered worthless. This skin in the game gives users confidence that miners will continue to run the network such that transaction integrity is maintained.
In contrast, it takes very little investment to run a node. Doing so can be done on a common CPU with negligible electricity spent to verify blocks. While your technical description of how the network operates is correct, we need to take into account the economic incentives to understand why the network operates this way. To a user, a node's verification means very little on its own. It's useful insofar as it alerts users to a potential error or malfeasance by the miners, but if nodes change their definition of block validity to be different than the miner's definition, the economic consensus will follow the miners, not the nodes.
It's for this reason that miner's define the consensus in economic terms, which are the only terms that matter. Nodes could change consensus rules all they want, but without credible disincentives to fraud (like PoW, PoS, or PoB) the system defined by those nodes would never attract significant economic activity since transactions could be falsified with very little effort. If nodes had genuine control over the definition of consensus, then we would expect to have seen countless Sybil attacks on Bitcoin that change the consensus rules to benefit the attacker. And yet we haven't seen this because node "control" over consensus is merely ceremonial and means virtually nothing in the economic definition of consensus.
@_date: 2017-03-24 21:30:05


That premise remains an unsubstantiated theory. It may turn out to be true, but like I said in my comment above it's very possible that it won't turn out to be true.
Decentralization is a value that I share, yet it needs to be taken in balance with other values. The arguments I have seen warning of centralization appear to be founded on unrealistic numbers and an overly narrow view of the incentives that apply to miners. Aside from those arguments, I don't think we've seen any empirical evidence that larger blocks lead to any degree of miner centralization. In the absence of evidence and in the absence of realistic arguments, I have to conclude that we are far from the balance point at which we would be forced to choose between centralization and network throughput.


Other approaches (such as LN) carry their own technical risks (from code bloat and system complexity), economic risks (such as the market dynamics associated with opening and closing channels), and privacy risks (from the increased clustering of transactions). This is not just "decentralization vs. centralization"; there are many other factors that hang in the balance, and favoring one to the exclusion of all others is not going to bring a good result.


I think this line of reasoning has merit. If I had my way I'd want an initial blocksize increase to ~2-4 MB today, with a geometric increase of some percentage per year, and requiring a hard fork to change.
As it stands though, we don't have that choice. In the absence of that choice I would rather trust the miners with choices for the network instead of trusting users or developers. Miners have significant capital invested in their hardware, and that investment is highly illiquid. If something goes wrong with the network the miners will be left holding the bag. People who simply have money invested in Bitcoin holdings can liquidate those holdings in seconds to another cryptocurrency. With such an easy exit I can't put as much trust into these people as I can into miners. If BU turns out to be a failure I believe the miners would change their minds and modify the protocol to something better before they would go down with the ship. It's much easier for users or developers to cling to a dying protocol since they either stand to lose no money, or can quickly and easily stop their losses by liquidating their holdings if things look bad.

It's not clear that larger blocks would lead to significant centralization. The numbers required for the big-block-centralization argument to work are unrealistic in my opinion. It's still an untested theory, and it's notoriously difficult to predict how markets behave based on theoretical assumptions alone. We've already seen miners defy a naive theoretical analysis of their incentives in 2014 when GHash.io voluntarily fragmented to avoid achieving majority hashpower.

One doesn't need to be an expert in cryptography to understand the market dynamics of Bitcoin, and likewise an expert in cryptography does not necessarily have any insight into how best to design Bitcoin to align with the economic incentives of users and miners.
And I think you've got that exactly backwards. The design of Bitcoin as a system is a conceptually high-level task. The use of cryptography to implement this system is a low-level detail.
I'm not sure what kind of point you're trying to make by differentiating between these two. Is it that "cryptographer" is supposed to connote higher status than a mere "software designer"? They are different roles with different skillsets required. One is not inherently "better" than the other, if that's what you're implying.

I greatly appreciate this. The thing I like least about this whole debate is how much antagonism has grown between people who share the same goal of establishing a functioning cryptocurrency out of the reach of the overlords of the legacy monetary system. I hope we can get there regardless of the technical path.






I'm in full agreement. Good ideas for a system this disruptive is unlikely to come from the intellectual establishment.
My concern specifically is a common thread I've seen in some discussions here in which a person's technical ability in software engineering or cryptography is used as a justification for trusting their judgement in matters outside the purview of software engineering or cryptography. And I am not so much interested in establishing specific "experts" for design of the economic incentives; instead I want to speak out against the appeal to expertise used to justify adherence to one protocol proposal or another. I want arguments about proposals to stand on their own, without reference to the username of the person making the argument. So I don't like statements such as "99% of the experts say X, so we should do X".


I am assuming the context of the debate about proposals related to blocksize management. In this context I don't think the main point of contention is about some technical cryptographic issue. It's about the economic incentives for miner centralization and the economic incentives associated with users of a system with a persistent transaction backlog. It takes no technical understanding of cryptography to understand and participate in this debate since it's not a cryptographic issue that's in contention.

Assuming they're not going to leave behind their previous bank/credit accounts, it would be marginally more hassle to set up a BTC exchange account.
However, the nice thing about BTC right now compared to other payment services is that there's more options for exchange method ( than there are options for interpersonal payment services (Dwolla, PayPal, Venmo, etc.). Disconnecting the payment service itself from the exchange service also provides the user more options; they can change the app they use to send/receive BTC without having to change BTC exchange service and vice versa.

This is why you're catching shit for your article. Calling something a pyramid scheme *implies intent*. If you don't believe that bitcoins were intended to be temporarily inflated in value, then cashed out, then *you don't believe bitcoin was operating as a pyramid scheme*. You believe it experienced a speculative bubble. The former is a subset of the latter, but they are not synonymous.

That's actually a colossal weakness of the current financial industry. Fractional reserve banking reduces the benefits of savings by promoting overconsumption and inflation.


There's not much reason to believe this will happen, so long as the USD continues to be devalued by state mismanagement of their currency. As long as the value of the USD is going down, there is a strong incentive to hold on to BTC as a store of value.
@_date: 2012-10-17 21:23:26


One of those services is long-term storage of value, isolated from the inflationary damage of the USD.
@_date: 2012-10-17 21:25:52


Correction: Its worth as a storage of value is directly due to the expectation of its worth as a transfer of value *in the future*. The fact that some people are hoarding BTC for future spending is reason enough for other people to do the same, since all hoarders share a mutual goal of having BTC in the future to trade with each other.
@_date: 2012-12-23 17:11:42
There are [many currency exchanges]( that deal in bitcoin. You can also [find local individuals]( who want to buy/sell bitcoin on a personal basis. The number of exchange locations is growing as bitcoin gains popularity.
The IP issue is a tough one. I don't know for sure, but there may be laws against bartering for illicit IP just as there are laws against selling it. Even if bitcoin isn't considered "currency" it may be illegal to offer a piece of IP for sale/trade/gift if it was illegally obtained in the first place.


Is that so? It would surprise me if it were the case.
At any rate, it wouldn't be difficult to conceal any payments you receive. It would be quite difficult for authorities to prosecute you for selling such things for physical cash. It is potentially more difficult for them to prosecute you for selling for digital cash.

It's my personal preference to deal with people I can trust, so I'm going to favor merchants and individuals who stand by their reputation and adhere to a consistent identity.

There's just as much safeguard as there is when paying someone cash.

In One's Possession.
Physical Gold


It is a child of electronic digits, ones and zeros, system based.
And therefore corruptible.
As says one of my acquaintances, a mathematician, who works for the NSA, in breaking codes, compromising systems and the like. 


Says he, not me.
I will take his knowledge and real time experience as non-theoretical and practical.


I merely point out that a fellow who seems in the know says it is not infallible, can be gamed.
And the more folks think not, the better it is to game and break.
I laughed when the NSA agent was portrayed as Santa Clausian, along with the ability to bend the laws of physics to his will. Naturally, the guy who made this comment is more willing to trust the character of the government agent than he is to trust his own judgement and the mathematical facts of the universe.
Besides, if it really is true that "anything that is electronic can be broken", does this guy expect to do his transactions in person, with physical pieces of gold/silver? Is he going to avoid all electronic banking and never use debit/credit cards?
Surely he realizes that the government can easily figure out how to violate property claims on physical assets too, not just electronic ones.

So what? Unless the people advocating for bitcoin as a direct medium of exchange are the same people who are hoarding bitcoin as a long-term store of value, there's no discrepancy here.
The people who want to use bitcoin for savings will hoard, and perhaps advocate for the use of bitcoin as a store of value.

Are you familiar with the 3D printer Reprap? It's capable of printing parts for a new Reprap. Let's assume for the sake of discussion that it is capable of printing an entire new Reprap.
I own 10 Repraps. I know I won't usually need to use all 10 at once, and I don't want them to just sit and go to waste while I'm not using them. I'd rather find some people who will use my unused printers while I'm not using them.
So I put them in a fractional reserve 3D printer bank. This bank promises it will keep 10% of my printers available for me to use whenever I want them, and will return 100% of them to me as long as I give them enough advance notice. Meanwhile, the bank goes out and finds people who want to put my 9 of my printers to use. Those people may use the printer for a while, maybe make a couple new printers in the process, and eventually will repay the loan by returning the printer to my bank. The bank's job continues to be finding people who will put the printers to use, until I want to withdraw the printers for my own use.
This is essentially how a fractional reserve banking system could work (though it's not how the current system works, due to state involvement). Money is generalized social capital. Often capital that is just sitting idle could be better employed by facilitating production of additional capital. So rather than putting money away under a mattress, where it will sit idle, sometimes it may be a good idea to give that money to someone who promises to give it all back at a future date, but in the mean time will use it to facilitate capital creation projects.
As long as the risks are identified up front, and the depositor knows about the time restrictions regarding withdrawals (need to give the bank time to get the 3D printers back), I don't see anything inherently fraudulent in this arrangement. On the contrary, I think it's an interesting method of addressing the problem of idle social capital.

By this do you mean that people may greedily want some degree of instability in the Bitcoin market that they can exploit? If so, then evidently those people don't want stability, and my statement stands.
I don't think it's very socially healthy of you to try and decide what other people should or should not want the Bitcoin market to be. They will decide for themselves whether they want stability or instability, and they'll take the steps they feel are appropriate to get what they want.

I think you're conflating two very different ideas under the moniker of the state. The first is the idea that the state has unquestionable authority in matters regarding their monopoly on violence. The second is the set of social norms regarding the proper use of violence in society.
A given society (like Somalia) may have a lack of belief in the state's unquestionable authority, but it may also have relatively violent social norms, resulting in a decentralized, emergent culture of violence.
Another society (like Canada, for example) may have a relatively strong belief in the state's unquestionable authority, but may also have relatively peaceful social norms, resulting in a centralized, dictated culture of peace.
I think that a stateless society will be in general better at satisfying individual subjective preferences than a statist society will. Those preferences may be violent, or they may be peaceful, but either way because of the information problems inherent to centralized legislative fiat, a stateless society will be better at turning those preferences into reality.
Maintaining a foundation of peace is not the primary measure of success of a stateless society. Fulfilling individual preferences is.


Regional politics is just one of many factors at play in the outcomes of society. It may even be one of the less significant ones, but it's probably the biggest one we can change just by discussing the issues and negotiating agreements. Natural resources, fresh water supply, transportation, agricultural capacity are all incredibly important components of a successful society, but those things won't magically change just by talking it over on the internet. So why don't people just go to northern Canada or Greenland? Because those places have really shitty environmental conditions, which is most of the reason why they're unclaimed by states in the first place. In a world where politics is dominated by statism, all the good places are already claimed by states. All that's left are the wastelands (Somalia included).


The insight is just one of the necessary components needed to make the transition. It's essentially the compass heading, pointing social evolution in the right direction. It doesn't represent the difficulty in getting from here to there though. We have millenia of centralized capital structures, social norms, and even linguistic traditions that have been built up around the ideas of centralized dictation of social order. These things aren't perfectly liquid (in the economic sense) and take some time and effort to transform into the configurations that make statelessness more efficient.
It's one thing to look at the map of energy levels of society, and from a bird's eye view simply point at where we are now, and point at some lower energy level over there. That's the easy part. The harder part is traversing the vast expanse that separates the two.
I think we're lucky in a sense, to have incredible tools of decentralization in our hands today, the internet and cryptocurrency most importantly. These are technologies that provide us with paths from A to B that have relatively low activation energies, if you will (I assume we're carrying the metaphor in terms of chemistry, right?). It doesn't take all that much personal sacrifice to bypass the state's centralized information distribution (by using the internet) or to bypass the state's centralized monetary institutions (by using bitcoin). The early adopters of each had a certain foresight, and knew that these technologies would pay off in the long run. They supplied some of the initial heat of reaction, even though there was no immediate payoff. Late adopters have to put some in too, but since the early adopters already pushed the system close to the tipping point, there's less risk for them to get involved. I don't think it will be too long before bitcoin is past that tipping point, and the immediate benefits of adopting will easily outweigh the costs, and we'll see a sea change away from fiat currency, and a quick exothermic slide away from state power.
But anyway, this process takes time. Social evolution doesn't take place overnight. 40 years is a flash in the pan in the context of the entire human history of statism. I think the information age has essentially reduced activation energies across the board, so whatever changes happen now will happen much faster and more easily than they did just 20 or 30 years ago. That's part of why I'm actually fairly optimistic about seeing stateless societies arising within my lifetime.

Even fraudulent and stolen currency is scarce. Only so much of it can be used before the fraud is discovered or the thief is injured/captured/killed in the process of stealing. Thieves and fraudsters have marginal consumption curves too.
Besides, I don't think this "market distortion" nonsense is a really useful way to analyze the situation. There is no "market" to be "distorted". If thieves and fraudsters are performing some undesirable actions, then there may be some demand among honest people to stop the thieves and fraudsters. If it's easy to stop the undesirable action, then the supply of "justice" (a generic way of saying "stopping undesirable action") will be plentiful and few thieves and fraudsters will get away with their actions. If it's hard to stop the undesirable action, then justice will be relatively scarce and thieves and fraudsters will get away with what they do. In either case, the "market for justice" will clear at whatever "price" obtains. Trying to push people to pursue justice more than they like (e.g. by collecting taxes to pay for police) would result in people spending too much for a given amount of justice. Trying to push people to pursue justice less than they like (e.g. by enforcing a state monopoly on police and/or courts, and outlawing "vigilantism") would result in people getting too little justice for what they are willing to pay.
The bottom line is, markets are never going to be "undistorted" and completely free from violence. At any rate, it's not going to help the situation to use additional violence to stop people from clearing the market for justice as they wish. It may be a "problem" (in the objective (wrong) sense) that violence will occur in a stateless society, but it won't be a problem (in the comparative sense) compared to how violence occurs in a statist society.

A bitcoiner is only beholden to the demands of governments to the extent those governments can put a public face to the name on the Bitcoin transactions. That capability is only as good as the capability to track fiat transactions. If the feds couldn't track the fiat transaction you used to get into Bitcoin, then they won't magically be able to associate your Bitcoin transactions with your public identity once you're in the Bitcoin economy.
With Bitcoin, the feds can see when anyone sends 20mBTC to their friend, but they can't see who was sending it or who their friend is. Without that information, they have no way of effectively directing their threats and demands to report the transaction.
Sure in some cases the feds will be able to trace a Bitcoin transaction back to some fiat transaction that was surveilled within the fiat monetary system. But Bitcoin itself doesn't *add* any traceability. A transaction that started out as untraceable in fiat will be untraceable in Bitcoin. A transaction that started out as traceable in fiat might end up traceable in Bitcoin, but it's not guaranteed.

If an average Chinese person likes the characteristics of fiat currency, there's no reason for them to favor renminbi over dollars (aside from network effect considerations). The best case scenario is that they get a new fiat currency no better than the last one, and have to suffer the cost of making the switch.
If an average Chinese person likes the characteristics of cryptocurrency, then they have a strong reason to favor bitcoin over dollars. There may be some costs associated with widespread adoption, but there is potential for substantial benefit in the change from fiat to cryptocurrency so it may be worth the cost. Changing from fiat to another fiat doesn't have that potential for beneficial change, so it's harder to motivate that change.
Going from fiat to fiat is like pushing a boulder across a flat field. It takes a lot of energy to do, and you don't end up changing the energy state of the boulder at all.

If people believe that this is a worthwhile goal to pursue, then this motivation will be a component of the demand for justice. Any voluntary organization designed to provide the corresponding supply for this demand would be different from a state though.


Even if this is true, that violent subjugation of the poor is a financially self-sustaining strategy, giving the state a monopoly on governance does not solve the problem. It just institutionalizes the state as the inevitable subjugator.


Because social evolution towards "efficient" outcomes is a *process*, and we're living in the middle of it. If we were living in a time period prior to the evolution of homonids, you might say "If opposable thumbs are really an evolutionarily dominant trait, why haven't we seen any creatures with them yet?" When a system evolves, by definition, the next best thing doesn't happen until it happens. In hindsight, evolutionary dominance looks trivially inevitable; but in foresight, it looks impossibly revolutionary. It's all about figuring out how to step out of our perspective bubble and see this social evolution as the temporally unidirectional process that it is.

Bitcoin is socially decentralized, whether that's important to those promoting it or not. Regardless of the *intentions* of those promoting Bitcoin, what *facts* imply that socially decentralized money will provide more control than socially centralized money?


Accumulation of money certainly doesn't *hurt* someone's power. At worst its neutral and at best it does add some degree of influence. There is some non-negative degree of power provided by an inflationary currency. For it to be worthwhile to move to a deflationary currency, there must be some non-negative benefit in doing so. What is it?


Markets don't operate on the majority. They cater to a plurality of interests, whether the majority agrees or not.

Probably because the renminbi doesn't have any characteristic advantages over the dollar; they're both just fiat currencies, and the dollar had a head start in network effects.

With the renminbi, Chinese politicians have to give people a reason to switch from the dollar and make it easy to do so. With bitcoin, the currency itself already offers reasons to switch, and politicians just need to make it easy to do so.

Adoption growth effect on the demand for Bitcoin is on the order 1000% or more (probably will accelerate in the coming years). I would guess that block reward has relatively little to do with the change in exchange rate over time.

I think you might have the causality reversed here:
It might be that a Bitcoin startup needs big VC funding to manage its compliance costs. Or it might be that startups that try to work above the board and with big VC funding must invest significantly in compliance.
A small company with anonymous funding and no connection to a public persona will be able to skirt around regulatory compliance. Silk Road was the biggest example of this; it wasn't made out to be a traditional business with a name, address, and telephone number on the business card, so DPR was (in theory, and in practice for a while) able to get away with ignoring regulatory compliance, and ended up massively successful in the process. Black Market Reloaded and Sheep Marketplace are traveling down the same path, and if they're careful to avoid the same obvious mistakes that DPR made I don't see why they won't be successful.
This same model of anonymous, compliance-free business can be easily applied to smaller ventures, and in doing so they'll gain less attention from the feds and be less likely to be shut down.

The asymmetry makes sense: merchants hold a more prominent position in the market and therefore have more invested in their reputation than does a single customer. If a single customer is prone to chargebacks and other untrustworthy behavior, it's very difficult for a merchant to know beforehand or gather information on a potential customer's reputability. There are hundreds or thousands of customers for every business - the numbers just don't add up for customer-based reputation systems.
On the other hand, businesses usually invest heavily into promoting a branded public image that represents their reputation. If a business acts untrustworthy, their behavior can be easily reported in an unmistakable way by tying the report to their brand name.
Because of this reputation asymmetry, it makes sense to use a payment system in which the customers (whose trustworthiness can't be easily verified) don't need to be trusted.

The value proposition exists regardless of the political implications. Lack of arbitrary monetary inflation makes it safer to hold on to than fiat. Irreversible transactions makes it more attractive than credit cards for merchants. Low transaction fees makes it attractive to both merchants and customers. Lack of central authority makes it attractive to anyone who's been screwed by PayPal, or Bank of America, or a Cypriot bank.

Yeah, it may take a while for the adoption curve to accelerate. But in the mean time, the people who were most willing to invest time and effort to understand and use Bitcoin early will continue building the infrastructure. Others who are a little less willing to be early adopters will probably see the growing infrastructure and hop on the bandwagon.

Fiat currencies are characterized by trust in a single party to honestly manage the money supply. If you like "human nature" arguments, I think it's fair to say that it's human nature for people with power to use that power for personal gain. Someone with centralized control of the money supply will use that power for their own gain, to the detriment of everyone else who uses (and are usually forced to use) that fiat currency.
Bitcoin does not work on the same model of trust in a centralized money supply manager. If an individual on the Bitcoin network tries to manipulate the protocol for their own gain, their changes to the protocol will simply be ignored by everyone else since no one is forced to abide by the changes. No centralized power structure means no effective way for anyone to manipulate centralized power for their own gain.

Why? Why would users choose hosted wallets with greenlist regulation over hosted wallets without greenlisting or personal management of their wallet? You keep asserting this without evidence or argument. Why would individuals freely choose to shackle themselves?


The fact that so many people have adopted Bitcoin despite being unable to spend it at Amazon and Walmart is proof positive that their lucrative market share is not as influential as you are claiming it is.


This assumes that the people transacting have chosen to adhere to the greenlist, which is what I'm asking you to support in the first place. Come on, keep up! People already choose to transact only when they are satisfied the apparent identity of their fellow transactor. I don't see any incentive for an individual to accept someone else's greenlist.

Inflationary monetary policy makes it difficult to tell the difference between this:


and this: 


Nominal demand may be increasing, but it's hard to tell if that's due to a genuine increase in purchasing power (real increase in demand) or simply due to money printing (no real increase in demand, just nominal increase).
A currency with significant monetary deflation would have the opposite effect of course.
The thing is that Bitcoin does not have monetary deflation built in. Once block rewards diminish, the total money supply will be relatively constant. If anything, a Bitcoin economy might experience *price* deflation, but that will be mostly due to productivity increases rather than decreasing monetary supply.

Really? I've seen the opposite is true. Going through a formal education program gives the impression that you've been taught "the official body of knowledge" and leaves people prone to using their degree and social credentials as a crutch.
Someone self-taught is constantly reminded of their ignorance every time they learn something new, and there's no graduation ceremony to give the illusion that they've learned everything.
Of course someone who's spent 7 years in formal training will likely be more of an expert than someone who's spent 1 year self-teaching, but when putting equivalent time in formal training and self-teaching against each other, I'd bet the self-taught guy will produce much higher quality innovation.

As more and more people accept bitcoin through a reseller, the need for the middleman becomes less and less. Eventually so many people will be accepting bitcoin (from the perspective of the buyer) that the reseller is obsolete and sellers will just hold on to bitcoin instead of cashing out to USD.
Essentially, accepting bitcoins directly and accepting bitcoins through a 3rd party reseller have equivalent influence on the push towards critical mass of network effects.

With a fixed (or slowly increasing) money supply, deflation only occurs due to economic growth (more value produced per unit currency available to represent it). It makes zero sense to say that this deflation (caused by economic growth) will stunt economic growth. If price deflation occurs with a fixed money supply, then it is a logical certainty that economic growth has occurred.

With fiat monetary systems, power can be gained just by exploiting the belief that people who call themselves "government" have the exclusive privilege of creating new money for themselves.

Bitcoins are not "held" on some physical "site". Bitcoins are not *objects*. We only refer to them as objects since it's a convenient heuristic for understanding a decentralized ledger in terms of the physical objects we've used as money for millenia.
The bitcoin protocol maintains ledger entries which specify value quantities for specific addresses. The ledger entries may change, but there is no corresponding "transfer" of a physical object in the process. There is no physically localized "bitcoin" that exists, so "bitcoins" cannot be accurately described as existing in physical space.

What volatility are you referring to in the linked chart? I see a pretty strong increase in value there. Does intermittent increase in value count as volatility?
I can see one 15-day period that was ripe for arbitrage (if you could have seen it coming) and several 1-day periods where a drop in price could net a (small) profit by buying back in after a well-timed short sell.
Other than that... where is the opportunity for arbitrage? And how is someone supposed to know in advance when to sell? It seems like hand-wavy voodoo to me.
I admit that it's impossible to tell when volatility will happen, so I can't say for certain that bitcoin *won't* be volatile in the future. But where does the confidence to say that bitcoin is "proven to be volatile" come from?

What exactly is Bitcoin demanding from late adopters?
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:38:02


I don't think this is quite correct. There is a (currently fixed) supply of block space, and there is variable demand for block space. Sure if supply remains fixed and demand increases, the price for block space (transaction fees) will increase, but that doesn't necessarily mean that miner profit is maximized. By increasing block size, miners may get lower fees per transaction, but they will also process more transactions, potentially netting more profit.
The block size, like any other supply and demand balance, must be adjusted dynamically to maximize profit.
Additionally, if it were really true that there's no incentive to increase block size, then unless there's something magical about 1MB (there isn't) then there would be an incentive for miners to *decrease* the block size until it's arbitrarily small. That would increase competition for the space and jack up transaction fees, right? But of course that would have a deleterious effect on number of transactions processed, which hurts miner profits.

I'm talking about the general price level change relative to a non-governmental individual's fiat holdings. When central banks print money, they are effectively increasing the supply of fiat currency. Given a relatively constant demand for currency, this will decrease the general price of things per fiat (which is an increase in price of dollars per thing).
The recipient of this printed fiat increases their fiat holdings faster than the general price level rises, so their purchasing power increases. The people not receiving the printed fiat have constant fiat holdings relative to the increasing price level, so their purchasing power decreases.
Interest rate changes have nothing to do with what I'm trying to convey.

Property norms are a limited subset of morality. It's entirely possible for an action to be morally "wrong", yet not be infringing on anyone's property right.
For example, it may be morally wrong to spread false defamatory rumors about someone, yet in doing so you are not infringing any property right of theirs. You are simply damaging their reputation. That's actually very similar to what happens when you spend "someone else's" bitcoins; you are sending a message to node operators that changes their opinion of the wallet in question, and the original wallet user suffers as a result.

The need to transact is just as "real" as the need for gold, oil, land, or healthcare. It's just a historical curiosity that the media that have been used to transact have also had alternative valuable uses.
What's keeping a perfect copy of bitcoin from starting up? The lack of activation energy. In order for a copy of bitcoin to successfully reach critical mass, enough people would have to devote activation energy to the clone despite the fact that an equivalent/good-enough bitcoin already exists and is further along the adoption cycle. If once the clone is fully adopted, it can only perform as well as or marginally better than the original, there's not enough potential benefit to motivate enough people to invest in the clone.
For another currency to supplant bitcoin, it would have to offer significant advantages over bitcoin, significant enough to warrant the hassle of going through a new adoption process all over again.

I understand that the people who wrote it were probably thinking "Bitcoin is taking off, we've got to do something about it". I'm just curious to see if the regulations they wrote actually *apply* to bitcoin, according to the letter of the law. I know the regulations were intended to apply to bitcoin, but I think it's possible they fucked up the wording or the form of the regulations due to a misunderstanding of what bitcoin is.
The reason I am bringing this up is because of some of the statements in that document that couldn't possibly apply to bitcoin, due to its nature as a decentralized value ledger, as opposed to a collection of separable, physically localized "pieces" of currency that can be "moved" or "transferred" from person-to-person or place-to-place.

Traditionally, democracies have had centralized executors of the vote, which is essentially why they always fail. Reddit has the site admins and subreddit mods that fill that role, but they rarely get involved in the voting mechanism here.
There has also been some kind of winner takes all mechanism in traditional democracy, where a single politician gets elected, or a single law is implemented to the exclusion of laws that would contradict it. Vote censorship on reddit is incremental and granular, so a comment doesn't "win" or "lose" based on the votes.
I wouldn't say this is all that much like democracy, other than the fact they both have votes.

Fee reduction is a benefit for both consumers and merchants, since fees get priced into the cost of the good or service and hurt both the producer and consumer.

Government agents handle taxes poorly because they have no incentive to do otherwise. People who collect voluntary revenue sources must continue to please their customers to keep the money coming. People who collect coerced revenue like taxes have no incentive to please their tax base; the tax will be collected whether or not the tax payers think the state's services are worth the money.
Sure, some government agents might be genuinely well-intentioned and intelligent at spending tax money, regardless of the incentives present, but we can expect they would be even more motivated to serve their funding sources well if they had the additional incentive of voluntary payment.

The problem is that with cryptocurrencies, the "USD" can't even be exchanged in "China", and the "CNY" can't even be exchanged in "The US". You could exchange private keys to trade control of a balance without having to propagate a transaction on the network, but that opens a big can of worms in security and trustworthiness issues.
Having an exchange with presence on Earth and Mars would enable transactions involving Marscoins while on Earth, and involving Earthcoins while on Mars. Someone goes to Interplanetary Exchange's offices on Earth and deposits their Earthcoin in IE's internal account. IE then credits some Marscoin into the user's account on the internal IE servers, then sends an internal transaction notice to their servers on Mars. Their internal network can be constructed without the block consistency requirements of the blockchain, so it could handle asynchronous updates to balances.
The user can then perform off-chain transactions with their Marscoin by using IE's internal network, or they can travel to Mars, withdraw their balance to an on-chain wallet then perform on-chain transactions as they like.

Using such a broad definition of "fiat" makes the word meaningless. *Anything* that has value has it because someone says so. Value is subjective. If you claim that anything that has value only because someone says so can be classified as fiat, then "is fiat" becomes a synonym for "has value". According to this definition, *gold is a fiat currency*, and with that implication I think it's obvious that this is just a poor way of communicating about value.
A much more useful definition of "fiat" is "declared to have value by a government". This is roughly in line with how the word has been historically used, and it also avoids broadening the definition to the point of meaninglessness.

I just think that any advantage a political ideology might have is finitely limited in power, and may not be enough to overcome other non-political obstacles. I don't think the right politics will magically transform any conditions into the best conditions. Ceteris paribus, good politics will overcome bad politics, but it's only a marginal improvement. If it were the end-all be-all advantage then we'd see way more intense movement of corporations across state lines within the U.S. to find the most conducive political climate regardless of social/environmental criteria.


It's certainly possible that some early adopters will take the plunge and try out statelessness in those wastelands. I think that's a high activation energy path towards statelessness, and is unlikely to see success.
I think cryptoanarchy will transform existing states relatively soon, whether those states like it or not. Moving to the frozen tundra seems a little unnecessary. "Renewing the tree of liberty" is a mode of social evolution that has been taking place within the statist paradigm of centralized organization. I think a shift toward decentralized capital structures will be an irreversible process that makes those statist revolutions obsolete.

I'm not clear on why the IMF would prefer a decentralized digital currency over a centralized one. I understand why centralized control structures are built on top of decentralized systems, but it seems it would be an advantage to simply start with a centralized system to begin with. You say it's an engineering advantage. For whom? Do you mean that a decentralized system will be more competitive in the open market for currencies, meaning individuals would prefer to use it over a centralized system, and therefore would be easier to disseminate? In terms of the engineering problem of controlling a population's monetary system, it seems decentralization is an engineering disadvantage rather than an advantage.
The state already has control over centralized identity clearinghouses (banks, credit ratings, SSN) built on top of a centralized currency (USD), so I don't see what advantage they have to gain by building centralized identity clearinghouses on a decentralized currency.


I don't see how that's the case. They can create a greenlist, but adherence to the greenlist is no easier to enforce than adherence to AML/KYC. The latter can be enforced through centralized banking systems, while the latter must be enforced at the individual level wherever a transaction is taking place since the decision to use the greenlist happens on a p2p basis.


I have no doubt that regulators would love to control Bitcoin with an identity clearinghouse or some other means of controlling the monetary system. I just doubt that Bitcoin represents an advantage in their pursuit for control, or that they'd have an incentive to propagate it rather than suppress it.


For central banks, inflationary currency seems like a tremendous advantage. When they want more money, they can print it and distribute it at will. With a deflationary currency and distributed minting process (block rewards) they can't mint new money for themselves at will and their income relies solely on the money they can overtly steal from discrete individuals, instead of the subtle, distributed theft by inflation.
Again, I could see how a deflationary currency is more attractive to individuals buying into the system, and therefore would be easier than an inflationary currency to impose on a population. That still seems like a disadvantage for people wanting control. I don't think people will voluntarily choose to shackle themselves if given the option, so the more attractive a currency is for individuals, the harder it will be to control. Deflationary currency seems like one of those attractive to individuals/hard to control features.

Because I was doing something on my coinbase account when I tabbed over to a merchant I was trying to buy something from. Had a lapse in judgement, got distracted, and started browsing other unrelated sites and forgot about the open coinbase tab.
I might generally be pretty security-minded, such that I would choose to enable 2FA on outgoing transactions and tolerate it every time I send, but sometimes just forget to be thorough. Even being fully knowledgeable of security, it would take superhuman consistency to completely eliminate every attack vector. Adding some other confirmation step to outgoing transactions would allow users to patch up one more possible leak in their security implementation.
This is all speaking from a hypothetical perspective anyway. I never keep balances in my coinbase account nor have I ever personally left a coinbase tab open while stepping away from my computer. I think it couldn't hurt to add 2FA as an option.

What about having a temporary window in which blocks of a certain height can be added? Maybe blocks can't be added lower than n blocks below the longest chain?
That should be incentive compatible too. If people decide to mine on a given height for a long time, eventually the rewards there will become so diluted that it's more profitable to add more height instead. The miners who create blocks at height h also have an incentive to increase the length of the chain to h+n as fast as possible to prevent others from diluting the rewards waiting to be distributed at h.
Perhaps miners would conspire to produce a series of blocks n long before releasing to the public, in essence the same kind of attack necessary to propagate a double spend. This would enable them to claim the entire reward at height h, but would only be successful if they could compute n blocks faster than anyone else could compute 1 block (very difficult to pull off).
Ideally the incentives would be such that each miner's optimal strategy would be to look for blocks at the highest leaf and submit each block as fast as possible, rather than mining at an old height or retaining blocks for later release.
Interestingly, with n=1, this protocol is identical to the current Bitcoin protocol. Only one block at each height is accepted, and the first one detected is the winner. I wonder if that would make this easier to roll out as a fork to the blockchain? The extra code could be added without actually changing block propagation behavior at first. Maybe it would then be possible for individual miners to choose for themselves what n should be? I haven't thought that through at all, and it may not be incentive compatible at all, but it's something to consider.

I'm not familiar with the intimate details of SEPA transfers and bank wire, but those seem like more centralized systems. It would only take a single bank, acting alone within a single state, to maintain an account balance. There's nothing inherent to the way traditional bank accounts are maintained that requires the consensus of all banks on the network.
However, Bitcoin *does* require consensus of all nodes on the network. It's certainly possible to build an entirely domestic Bitcoin network, but that's not what has happened.
Bitcoin is not like traditional monetary systems. A transaction cannot be isolated to just the people releasing and accepting bitcoins. Each transaction necessarily involves everyone on the network (which is to Bitcoin's strength). If you were to conduct a transaction using traditional monetary methods, like gold or paper dollar bills, it would be sufficient to hand over the money to the other person and say "It's yours now." With Bitcoin, that's not sufficient; you have to broadcast a message to everyone on the network saying "I want to give bitcoins to this guy. Can you all verify that I have those bitcoins, and verify that he is receiving them?" and everyone on the network says "Yes, we hear you, and we'll record the transaction on our ledger."
If even *one* node on the Bitcoin network is foreign, every Bitcoin transaction falls under the letter of the law here. If the regulators and courts understand this nuanced fact about Bitcoin, they will make as liberal an interpretation of the law as necessary to screw you over. They won't care that you believe you're "doing everything locally". I think it's total bullshit, but that's how the IRS works.


If that's true, it doesn't really disprove the foreign nature of Bitcoin transactions. It just highlights the possibility that this law could be construed to apply to far more transactions than it would appear at first glance.

In any voluntary system, in order to make money a person must provide a net benefit to the people he is transacting with. Since participation in the Bitcoin network is voluntary, anyone preserving or growing their Bitcoin wealth is evidently providing some ex ante benefit to others. It's certainly a problem that ex ante benefit does not always imply ex post benefit, but that's a problem with any transaction, not just with Bitcoin.
Compare that to fiat currencies where participation is mandatory (I have to buy USD to pay my taxes no matter how little I like USD). Bitcoin has a mechanism for individuals to opt out of abusive monetary manipulation; fiat currencies do not. Without a means of opting out, abusive behavior accumulates and grows, rather than being punished by customers opting out. Thus fiat currencies attract and perpetuate abusive actors, while a system like Bitcoin purges abusive actors.


Can you paint a picture of someone who might be hurt by price walls?
It takes quite a bit of capital to create a price wall, and the return is likely to be no bigger than the order of magnitude of the cost of putting up the wall. When it comes to political manipulation of fiat currencies, one can achieve returns that are orders of magnitude larger than the cost. Citigroup can pay Jacob Lew $100,000 to influence his monetary decisions, which could result in millions in benefits to Citigroup. Since Jacob doesn't have to risk his own assets with his monetary decisions (he can risk the assets of his subjects instead), he doesn't mind paying out millions in benefits to Citigroup in return for $100k. Without the ability to opt out, people who must use the USD are granting Jacob Lew massively more power than he could afford to buy in a voluntary system like Bitcoin.

There's nothing inherent to a Bitcoin transaction that implies ownership of anything. It's essentially one person paying someone else for a service: the service of sending a special message to other Bitcoin node operators. Maybe that message transmission will result in the buyer being able to "spend" "bitcoins" later, but bitcoin sellers don't make that guarantee, nor could they. The ability to "spend" "bitcoins" is contingent on all node operators continuing to run the current dominant fork of the blockchain, and on all other people on earth agreeing not to use the private key associated with the destination wallet. None of those people are party to the transaction of "buying" "bitcoins", so there can be no obligation imposed on them by carrying out the transaction.

Is this a joke?


Nope. This is the same fallacy on which Keynesian monetary policy depends. Healthy economies depend on people being able to plan their saving and spending based on actual economic needs, rather than how quickly your cash is going to kill you. (Besides, people would just start storing their cash in lead vaults, then use electronic accounting to carry out day-to-day transactions, like bank accounts are used now.)


Water becomes extremely valuable in droughts or when a disaster disrupts the water supply. That doesn't mean it's a good thing to have water shortages. Similarly, having money that's trying to kill you may increase the relative value of things that protect you against money, but it would be better to simply have money that's not trying to kill you. This is the essence of the broken window fallacy.
I'm pretty sure this is a joke though, and I'm taking this way too seriously. :(

Again, there is a massive difference between *losing something* and *not gaining something*. What you are describing here is *not gaining something*. A "potential to make money" is not something someone can own.
In fact, if "losing" a potential to make money were really a valid excuse for legal protection, then any shop owner could claim that the new shop down the street is infringing on his potential profits, and the new shop should be closed down. He could also claim that anyone who *chooses not to buy from him* is infringing on his potential profits, since that person could have chosen to buy from him instead. That choice results in a smaller potential market for your sales, right? According to you that is valid grounds for legal "protection".

First we have to remember the difference between price deflation and monetary deflation. Bitcoin is currently undergoing price deflation while also undergoing monetary inflation. Eventually block rewards will go away and there will be minor monetary deflation as individuals lose their Bitcoins "at the bottom of the ocean".
I can only assume that anti-deflation arguments are presented as if they were trying to help the average person improve their economic standing. In other words "Deflationary currency will make you worse off, so you should avoid it". It's pretty simple to see that such a claim is patently absurd when applied to a currency like Bitcoin without significant monetary deflation.
If the average Joe is experiencing price deflation while using Bitcoin, then his purchasing power is increasing for the things he wants to buy. This means he's becoming economically better off. Presumably, the price deflation Joe experiences will eventually be so severe that Joe will become economically worse off. That's why the argument is posited, right? To warn Joe of impending economic misfortune? Of course if prices are severely deflating when denominated in a currency with relatively stable supply, it can only mean that production of the things people want to buy is *massively increasing*. This means Joe can buy more of the things he wants, so naturally he will be economically better off.
That's really all there is to it. It takes a completely logically twisted mind to conceive of the idea that this is a *bad* thing.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think credit does make sense during deflation. If I lend out 100 BTC, and I expect 1% deflation over the loan period, and I want a 1% profit by offering the loan, then I'll set the terms of the loan such that the lessee owes me 100 - 1% + 1% = 100 BTC when the loan is due. Or if I want 5% profit, I'll ask for 104 BTC back. Or if I want 1% profit, and I expect 5% deflation, I'll ask for 96 BTC back.
Why does deflation suddenly make loaning unviable?

The USD had (and has) an astronomical advantage in network effect over cryptocurrencies before they were introduced.

Network effect is clearly not the end-all, be-all advantage when it comes to currency.


Do you mean "backing" like monetary backing with physical commodities? If so, that's exactly the problem Bitcoin was created to solve. Backing requires counterparty risk; you must trust the backer to follow through with their promises.

It is not Bitcoin's properties and uses that are evidence it is a threat to governments' monetary systems. It is the fact that people are demonstrating that they *don't want fiat*. Every Bitcoin bought is more importantly several hundred pieces of fiat currency *sold*. People buying Bitcoin are declaring with their actions that they would rather increase their balance on the Bitcoin ledger than maintain their balance on whatever fiat currency ledger their bank is using.
You can argue until you're blue in the face about the properties of Bitcoin and their supposed uselessness as a currency. All that arguing is irrelevant in the face of the empirical reality that peoples' preference for Bitcoin over fiat is increasing. The power to print themselves more fiat is only useful to governments so long as there are people who actually want to hang on to that devaluating currency, and the rising exchange rate is proof positive that such power is dwindling. (edit: From this perspective, it's also easy to see how absurd it is to claim that the rapidly rising exchange rate represents a threat to Bitcoin's existence. As long as it's rising, that's evidence that, all things considered, people are increasingly preferring Bitcoins over dollars. Their reason may be as of yet unknown, but apparently the rising exchange rate is not deterring them from expressing their preference.)
It's a common misnomer that Bitcoin's exchange rate has an upper limit of ~$1,000,000 (give or take a couple orders of magnitude). If Bitcoin is wildly successful to the point that it begins supplanting the USD in the majority of transactions, there will be a sea change in which fewer and fewer people will be willing to accept those worthless dollars for goods and services. As the bread-to-dollar ratio plunges (and the bread-to-Bitcoin ratio remains stable), the price of a Bitcoin could easily exceed $1,000,000 and actually go asymptotically to infinity as people no longer want to acquire dollars *at all*. It's more accurate to say that Bitcoin could appreciate to the value of a basket of goods available in 2013 for $1M. By the time Bitcoin reaches that point though, $1M will hardly be enough to buy that basket of goods anymore.

@_date: 2013-08-31 14:19:39
The question is, if economic growth is -2% per year, and the money supply is increasing, does it follow that there is "no inflation" (meaning no decrease in purchasing power)? Economic growth is positively correlated with purchasing power, so -2% growth indicates a decrease in purchasing power. Money supply is negatively correlated with purchasing power, so increasing money supply indicates a decrease in purchasing power. The facts stipulated by the OP indicate that there *will* be "inflation" (meaning decrease in purchasing power) and yet he claims that there won't be "inflation".
Whichever definition of "deflation" and "inflation" you use, the OP's claims are logically contradictory.

I need to clarify what I mean by "decentralized" in this discussion. I'm referring to social decentralization, not technological decentralization. A "decentralized" computer network in your basement is socially centralized; there is a single person in charge of operating it, and it only takes co-opting of that single person to control the network. Banks are moderately socially centralized since they act as a concentrated node of interactions between individuals. Instead of co-opting every person with a Bank of America account, the BoA CEO or board of directors can be co-opted, granting control of all the BoA accounts. They may use decentralized technologies to run their business (TCP/IP, ACH) but the social hierarchy at play is centralized.
In contrast, Bitcoin is socially decentralized. Not even the Bitcoin Foundation can mandate changes to the network. If Gavin and the rest of the Foundation are really IMF plants, they'd still have to co-opt people at the individual level to control the network. I'm not saying this can't be done, but it's a heck of a lot more difficult than controlling a centralized social hierarchy.
As it stands, the current monetary systems in place are socially centralized (central banks, corporate-controlled demand deposits, etc.). What advantage in control is gained by moving to a socially decentralized monetary system? 


If control, and not profit, is the goal, what advantage in control is gained by moving to a limited-supply currency with socially decentralized minting from an unlimited-supply currency with socially centralized minting?


The reason people tolerate intermediaries and counter-party risk in the current monetary system is because they need someone to handle the in-between steps of a transaction. I can't magic my dollar bill through my ethernet cable by myself since it doesn't have trustless verification built in like Bitcoin; I need a "reputable" third party to do that for me. With Bitcoin there is no such incentive to get a third party involved. Coinbase needs your bank information because it's interfacing with the old, trust-based monetary system. Paypal is entirely embedded in the old system too. What role is there for Paypal when people can perform peer-to-peer transactions across the globe, with trust-less escrow built in? I understand it's possible that centralized control of wallets could be mandated, just like it's possible that centralized control of personal accounts could be mandated in the current system. I don't see how enabling p2p digital transactions provides an advantage of control when it removes the incentive to tolerate counterparty risk.

They'll lose access to all the transactions occurring on the other fork, which means losing access to all the associated transaction fees and a loss of mining profit. The coins they mine will also stay on their minority fork, and when they try to spend those coins to an address on the majority fork, they'll be unconfirmed and rejected.

If mining is not worthwhile due to power costs, some people will turn off their mining rigs. As network hash power falls, difficulty will fall with it to adjust for the 1 block per 10 minutes target. That increases the block reward per electricity cost and mining remains profitable, albeit at a lower hash power and with fewer participants.
The mining incentives are dynamically adjusted to ensure that mining is always at least marginally profitable.

This is only a problem until knowledge is produced. Once it's produced, the cost of production isn't a factor anymore...
Intellectual property doesn't address the cost of knowledge production. It applies to knowledge *after* it's been produced. It is a tool to restrict access to knowledge, not to promote production of it.
We've had the right economic model to handle knowledge production for centuries: hired/commissioned labor. Knowledge production is a *service* and should be treated as such. After all, it's the act of production that's the actual scarce component of knowledge, not the knowledge itself. The people who want knowledge produced should hire someone to produce knowledge, rather than the producer trying to monetize the knowledge itself.

This is not what I claimed. I claimed that *the act* of money laundering does not *victimize* anyone. I did not claim that *in the event of* money laundering, there are no *victims*.

Burying drums of hexavalent chromium by the school well and then **not** laundering money victimizes the schoolchildren. Burying drums of hexavalent chromium by the school well and then laundering money does not victimize any additional schoolchildren. The act of laundering money does not create victims so it is not criminal.
You could say that keeping information about one's cashflow private potentially hides evidence of actual criminal activity. But you could say the same thing about keeping any other kind of information private too. It just so happens that controlling information about money transfers is much more profitable for our monetary overlords than controlling just about any other information, so it's the kind of privacy most vilified by the people who stand to lose profit if it's kept private.

I recognize your definition of scarce, and according to that definition I think the points you made make perfect sense.
However, the definition you've provided for scarcity is a nonstandard one. The concept you defined and called "scarcity" is more commonly called "rivalry":


I'm not saying your definition is *wrong*. I'm just saying it's non-standard. Which is fine! It's just a bit hard to understand for anyone who is used to the standard definitions.


Definitions are not "false" or "true". They are stipulative. As long as I make clear what I'm talking about, I can define a word however I like. I generally like to use standard definitions though, since those are easiest to explain.


I actually never said that "you're wrong". I actually agree with what you said in your previous comment; I just think it can be said better by using the word "rivalrous" instead of "scarce".

This process takes some non-negligible time. If the USD/BTC exchange rate rises faster than you can perform your arbitrage, then moving fiat around is not worthwhile. You may as well buy BTC with it and hold the BTC instead of selling. An example:
USD/BTC is $500 on Bitstamp and $550 on MtGox. All your assets are currently in BTC, so you go to MtGox and sell 1BTC for $550. You transfer $550 to Bitstamp. Let's be generous and assume this takes 12 hours to do (if you don't have a Japanese bank account, it's more like a couple weeks). 12 hours later, USD/BTC is $575 on Bitstamp and $650 on MtGox. You buy BTC on Bitstamp for $575 each, netting you 0.96BTC, less bank transfer fees, exchange fees, and Bitcoin transmission fees.

Arbitrage requires some amount of non-BTC currency to be moved around between exchanges, or sitting in exchanges waiting to be converted to BTC. You can make a profit through arbitrage by using that fiat, but it comes at a price: any fiat you are holding for the sake of arbitrage is money not riding the BTC appreciation wave.
On a day like today, you'd have to be capable of making profit totaling 5-10% of the fiat you're holding onto for it to make sense to do arbitrage instead of just buying BTC and holding.
It's the steadier days that make arbitrage more attractive, which is why you can expect to see smaller price differentials then than you're seeing today.

Most nations that operate central banks use fiat currency printing to effectively increase their revenue streams by proportionally devaluing the fiat holdings of all non-governmental accounts. The fewer people holding fiat in their savings accounts, the less power such inflationary money printing has for generating effective revenue.
Bitcoin offers an alternative store of value in which no one can autonomously decide to mint more units. A majority of miners must reach a consensus on the block reward programming before anything gets changed. Since any given miner is unlikely to see concentrated benefits from increasing block reward rate (rewards are on average distributed over the whole network), they have little incentive to join an inflationary consensus.
So in effect, Bitcoin is "inflation proof" in that the rate of Bitcoin production is set and is highly unlikely to be changed arbitrarily. This means someone who wants to operate a long-term savings account is better off doing so using Bitcoin than by using fiat currencies. Commodities also work well for this purpose, but Bitcoin is relatively unique in that you can do short-term savings as well without sacrificing liquidity. If you dump your monthly paycheck in gold bullion, it's going to be a huge hassle to pay for your daily expenses with it; Bitcoin is much easier by comparison, and will be extremely easy once more merchants get on board.
Once exchange rate volatility dies down, any money you plan on holding on to for more than a few days or weeks can be put into Bitcoin with no downside. As more and more people sell their fiat for BTC, there's less fiat-denominated monetary holdings for central banks to inflate. They can still print pieces of paper, but the government might be one of the few organizations that accept it for payment, so they're mostly just inflating their own private stash, which doesn't increase their buying power at all. It just drives the exchange rate higher and higher until they go the way of the Zimbabwean dollar.
This is a threat to the state's revenue stream regardless of how well they can control Bitcoin addresses or prosecute not compliance of AML/KYC laws, etc. etc. As long as the Bitcoin economy strengthens (whether in the white market or black) and the dollar value of Bitcoin holdings increase, the state loses the power to print itself more spending power.

The choice of currency as a medium of exchange would be irrelevant. It's the choice of currency as a store of value which matters.

I don't doubt that the state has a strong incentive to get people to use a digital currency if it would give them an advantage in tracking financial information. I just doubt that Bitcoin gives them an advantage over the status quo of everyone using credit cards issued by a handful of corporations who are all quite cooperative with the state. Why bother changing what already works so well?
And since Bitcoin is decentralized, rather than centralized like the current financial system is, it seems much harder to co-opt by the centralized power of the state. If a decentralized consensus wants to change Bitcoin to avoid state control, I don't see how the state could stop it from happening.

I don't think it's productive to debate the factual evidence of whether the IMF had a hand in creating Bitcoin. The evidence is inevitably hard to come by and difficult to interpret accurately.
Instead, I think the implications should be considered in the hypothetical case that the OP's claims are true:
* Does Bitcoin represent more monetary freedom or less compared to the status quo (or compared to altcoins, etc.)?
* Is it easier to control a decentralized currency that can't be inflated, or a centralized currency that can be inflated?
* Is it reasonable to expect greenlists catching on in spite of pro-privacy incentives to the contrary?
* Assuming greenlists do catch on, does this represent a greater or less degree of control compared to the IMF's current control over fiat currency banking?
Depending on the answers to these questions, the factual basis of the IMF narrative may become irrelevant. Maybe it's true that this is the IMF's master plan, but they didn't think it through and it's actually a great improvement over the status quo for me. Or maybe the IMF's master plan is exactly what they wanted, it's worse for me, but there's nothing I can do about it so I might as well get in on the ground floor. I welcome any arguments in either direction.

I don't really like describing the "rules" of Bitcoin as "programmed in". I feel it implies that the code is immutable by the average person, and they are physically prevented from using other code.
What really maintains the protocol is social pressure, not some physical restriction. People are physically permitted to use whatever code they want, but the social pressure is likely to prevent them from making changes such as increasing the money supply.
I know this is a semantic disagreement, just over the words used to describe how the protocol is maintained. I just think it's important to emphasize the social pressure side of the equation rather than the bits and bytes of the software.

You don't "own" *anything* with regard to Bitcoin. Here's why:
Bitcoin is nothing more than the blockchain, which is a collection of *opinions* expressed by node operators, established by consensus within the collectively agreed-upon rules of the Bitcoin protocol. Opinions can't be owned, certainly not by anyone other than the person expressing that opinion.
When a Bitcoin transaction transpires, one person (the wallet "owner") sends a message containing privileged information (transaction signed by a private key) to node operators in exchange for payment (goods/services). This transaction does not impose any obligation on node operators to maintain the blockchain in such a way that the bitcoin buyer will be able to spend his bitcoins; the bitcoin buyer and seller cannot force node operators to change their opinion on the state of the blockchain in such a way that the buyer can spend the coins. The transaction also does not impose any obligation on others to not send one of those messages with privileged information. The privileged information is just the combination of a few different special numbers, and numbers can't be owned no matter how special they are.


Phillip is making up complicated verbiage to justify a predetermined conclusion he wants to arrive at. He knows that he wants to own *something* with regard to Bitcoin, but he doesn't know exactly what or why he owns anything, so this is the way of phrasing he's figured out to make it sound as plausible as possible that something is owned. You can tell that this is just a smokescreen, and not an actual explanation of what exactly is owned, because the subject of ownership is left incredibly abstract: "outputs". An output isn't a *thing*. It's an abstract descriptor of an object's relationship to other objects. What exactly is the *thing* that's "put out"? Phillip doesn't say. And he *can't* say because there are no Bitcoin objects which can be owned. It's an entirely abstract *communication protocol*.
Let's say I have some federal reserve notes. If I say I own traditional fiat bank transaction outputs, that describes the relationship between the object I own and some other objects (such as a bank, bank employees, and maybe a withdrawal slip), but it doesn't tell you what the *substance* is that I own. You could inquire further and ask which *object* is referred to by "transaction outputs", and I could actually tell you in this case that I own certain *pieces of paper*. That's the substance I own.
If I say that I own Bitcoin transaction outputs, you might inquire further and ask what *object* is being output, but I wouldn't be able to answer you. There's no object here. It's all in the abstract. The only objects involved in the Bitcoin network are the node operators, their computer hardware, and the networking hardware and computer hardware used by wallet operators. I don't own node operators, and I don't own the right to change their opinion. I don't own anyone else's computer hardware, nor the right to change the data on their computers. There's no *substance* of ownership that corresponds to any number of "bitcoins". It's all in the abstract, which is probably the best reason why Bitcoin is/will be successful.

There is no transmission of money because *there is no "money"*. No one owns any bitcoins because *there are no "bitcoins"*. There are just many copies of the blockchain, which express a set of opinions on the value associated with certain numbers (addresses).

The volatility cuts both ways. If you hold bitcoins and the exchange rate falls, the risk hurts you. If you hold dollars and the exchange rate rises, the risk hurts you.

Sure, but that's primarily a problem only for the people losing their coins, while everyone else is enjoying a relative increase in purchasing power due to the loss. The person who is losing out here is both capable of avoiding the loss by more properly securing their wallet, and has an incentive to correct the problem since their own money is on the line. There's really no need to worry about this "problem" since individual incentives promote a self-correcting system.

 you explain why you think so? You said so yourself: "Don't offer ANY insight, don't offer alternative evidence or proof, ignore reality!" Please heed your own suggestion and give some reasoning.


 doesn't answer the question of ease of control.






 You're missing a step in the logical inference you're trying to present. Sure banks might use their current control of fiat currencies to throttle entry into Bitcoin (despite leaks through cash transactions, and growth of closed-loop Bitcoin economies), but what happens after people have entered the Bitcoin economy? Is there a reason people conducting Bitcoin-for-goods/services transactions would insist on greenlisted coins/addresses instead of ignoring the greenlist? Are the incentives to support greenlisting greater than the incentives to avoid it?


Being able to track the history of the blockchain might be one step towards control, but it is not control itself. How do you think someone could use the blockchain to control behavior? I understand that as a general heuristic, information = power = control, but I think you need to be far more specific about what exactly is being controlled and how.

I totally agree that money is memory, and that Bitcoin needs no industrial use before qualifying as a phenomenal money. I just think you (and many other Bitcoin critics) are reading too much into the regression theorem and claiming it says more than it actually does.

As it stands, legal and contractual guarantees are only as trustworthy as the people enforcing them. As we're well aware, organizations such as the US Government are quite capable of changing their mind about which sort of currency-related contracts or laws should be enforced.
A government is the last thing I want to rely on for a guarantee of my money. That's the very problem that Bitcoin was designed to solve in the first place.

For anyone who hasn't yet figured out what's so backwards about the "inflation is good" argument, here's what's so blatantly wrong with this reasoning:
Whether or not someone saves money instead of spending it is in part due to the expectation of future **purchasing power**, which, roughly speaking, is positively correlated with economic activity, and negatively correlated with money supply. According to the OP's hypothetical, economic activity is slowing ~~faster than the~~ and* money supply is growing, so one would expect their purchasing power to be constantly **decreasing**. Decreasing purchasing power provides an incentive to purchase consumables, purchase durable goods for future consumption, or purchase durable goods for future trade. Performing any of those actions *increases economic activity*, and thus will start reversing the trend of decreasing purchasing power. This is a self-stabilizing system, and there's no reason to think that a constant money supply will lead to runaway collapse of an economy.
\* edit: Money supply growth and slowing economic activity both contribute to lower purchasing power. In OP's hypothetical, both of these things are happening, yet he claims purchasing power is increasing. This doesn't make sense.

Not really seeing your point here. I'm not trying to make an argument for fiat or against Bitcoin; just trying to sort out the facts of what Bitcoin is and whether it's a legitimate candidate for ownership. I think Bitcoin will be wildly successful in spite of (or perhaps because of) the lack of any substance of ownership. Bitcoin can't be stolen by taking a localized physical object from an individual person; it can only be "stolen" by changing the opinion of a vast number of node operators, which is much harder to do, and therefore makes it much harder to be a thief in a Bitcoin economy.

A wallet is identified by a private cryptographic key. This key can either be stored in a local file, or algorithmically generated with a seed value. The local file can be accidentally deleted, or the seed value can be forgotten.

The dollar itself has no built-in security features (for the owner, of course; it has plenty built in to protect the Fed's monopoly on printing). All of the security developed for consumer accounts is built in another layer on top of the currency itself.
This kind of service abstraction can be implemented with Bitcoin too. If you want a business to handle your security for you, there are companies already who will meet your needs (Coinbase is maybe the best example currently).
Good technologies are encapsulated and extensible. They implement essential features without excess bloat, and provide interfaces for adding custom features to suit individual needs. There are some people who might want additional security on their Bitcoin account, and they would be served by baked-in security features, but there are also people who prefer to handle security in their own way, or want to implement innovative security features that improve upon the existing state of the art. Baking in security features into Bitcoin itself would hinder such innovation and the variety of use cases.

I'm not sure what you mean. It's a conclusion that I've come up with on my own. Simply holding bitcoins will provide some significant financial advantage, but once the adoption rate levels out that advantage becomes static. It's also an advantage that can't be held without being spent, so assuming someone actually wants to *use* their advantage it will have to dissipate. (Central bankers can use their advantage of monetary authority without dissipating it.)

It just so happens that there are far more than just one agent on this planet, and those agents have built their entire society around the abstract exchange of value via a monetary system. *As long as that is true*, then anything which holds superior properties for fulfilling that purpose will be valued for that purpose.
People demand a way to communicate about value transactions, and Bitcoin fills that demand. Thus it is valuable. As long as people interact in societies with a division of labor and generally illiquid goods and services, monetary systems *qua monetary system* will be valuable, intrinsic value or the Misesian regression theorem be damned.

They figure out that fractional reserve banking isn't a good idea, and search for a full reserve bank (or no bank at all) next time they want to store some bitcoins. If FRB really is undesirable, then it won't take long for people to figure this out and avoid FRB in the future.
In the current system, we have people directly using reserve notes for transactions, rather than exchanging their reserve notes for hard currency every time they want to make a transaction. Since the reserve notes are rarely redeemed, the bank can lend out reserve notes with a high multiplier without much fear of having to pay out that hard currency.
With bitcoin, I don't see much reason why people would prefer to use some bitcoin reserve note instead of actual bitcoins in their transactions. Unlike gold, it's not really inconvenient to carry around your bitcoins, so someone trading bitcoins in for bitcoin reserve notes gains no worthwhile utility. So assuming the bitcoin itself remains the actual medium of exchange at the point of sale, a fractional reserve bitcoin bank is going to have to pay out their "hard currency" every time someone makes a bitcoin transaction. The bank won't be able to get away with lending at huge multipliers since their risk of default would be very high. We can expect that FRB would be far less prevalent than it is today.

I don't really understand this constant reference to "grandma" in bitcoin discussions. Currency isn't really meant to be an investment in the first place; it just functions as such now when people are speculating on its future adoption. Once it's adopted, there won't be much room for safe, constant-return investment.
Grandma could certainly use bitcoin if she wanted - for the short-term, low-risk transactions like buying from bitcoinstore.com or for international money transfers. Or if she ran a business selling quilts off her front porch, she could accept bitcoin and cash out at the end of each day. The most she could possibly risk is one day's profits if bitcoin suddenly dropped to zero.
The fact is, if you are a consumer of popular electronic components, you're a potential bitcoin user, without having to risk your savings over exchange market volatility.

Block reward honestly doesn't seem relevant to the price, nor will it be for the rest of Bitcoin's lifespan.

The effect of new Bitcoin production is negligible in comparison to the other factors influencing the exchange rate.

If retailers are in a deflationary environment (with relatively constant monetary supply) then *evidently* goods and services are becoming more available.
