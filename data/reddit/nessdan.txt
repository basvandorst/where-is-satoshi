Edit: I was wrong in this instance. [It seems ChangeTip discontinued it's service due to a logistics reason from being "acqui-hired".](

~~During the Bitcoin rush, sending any amount of Bitcoin would've taken you around $35+ and taken a while to actually be confirmed.~~

Wow, what a coincidence! [I tagged you a month ago because of a comment]( you made in a thread.
I didn't know anything about the topic being discussed and was trying to find out more and your reply...
That was one of the few occurrences that made me realize that Bitcoin wasn't the happy family I thought it was and had drama inside the community, from there it's just been eye opening and sad.

[Keep thinking like that...](
Unless you're running ECC memory on a server, this is always a risk. [The problem is even more prevalent on a mobile phone.](

Imagine if your computer had faulty RAM and when you entered your "To" address, it flipped an "a" to an "r".
Edit: [It does happen]( and [even more so on mobile.](

His other statement still stands. If they made a blog post about it, I'd call that confirmed.
