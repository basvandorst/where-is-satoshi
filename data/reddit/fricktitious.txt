That happens now, so I don't see how making it less transparent would be worse.

Sorry, I get what Paleo means, but I'm curious about what you are doing to support it. 
@_date: 2014-01-22 14:54:09
Yeah but isn't carrying bitcoin almost the same as carrying cash? If someone had bitcoin on their android phone and paid using that, the phone could be stolen and then the bitcoin wallet would be in the possession of the thief.

throws down crepe.
@_date: 2014-01-19 15:51:43
Story please. When did you order, when did you receive it and which one did you get?
@_date: 2014-01-22 15:15:27
I know what I'm going to do next time I go to The Netherlands! 
@_date: 2014-05-29 00:50:42
Not being pedantic, what does supporting paleo mean? 
@_date: 2014-01-19 16:08:03
Well This morning I had some coffee, then water. Let me tell you it was a very smooth operation. 
@_date: 2014-01-22 20:53:28
Maybe. More like vlaai!

Email would be dead to me without google. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 14:00:18
Why would they want to do this? Wouldn't that undermine the stability of bitocoin and be detrimental to public adoption and acceptance. I can see why they would do it in the short term - cash money. But in the long term it seems like a bad idea. 
@_date: 2014-01-22 20:52:52
Is that an app that does that?
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:09:26
I had the same thought. I feel like this is some kind of joke. It seems like there's a turning point in the piece where she just turns on him.

There's still dinner on my dinner jack it when the dinner bell rings.

What does "a computer company" mean? A company with computers or a company that services computers? Well these days that covers every company everywhere anyway.

He looks a lot like this guy.  from this movie. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 12:39:27
Cute. Is this because the trading price has increased 10+ percent?
@_date: 2015-05-09 21:48:25
I'd love to get ahold of one to put in my desktop btc mining museum :)
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:02:09
Its more like, on you got fired? well your job sucked anyway compared to mine. get a better one.
@_date: 2014-02-16 04:41:06
It's just Satoshi. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 03:51:44
Basically, yes. 
@_date: 2014-01-22 14:54:58
How much did each one cost on average? What was the most expensive? Were they nice or just down to business?
@_date: 2014-01-19 03:11:14
Yeah seriously you'd make more money putting it in fiat in a CD in a bank. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 03:41:04
Maybe Hacker news has a competing coin they are trying to grow. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 12:45:40
Maybe Alpha
@_date: 2013-06-04 17:17:11
Specifically what is the danger? That your imported coins will disappear because the block chain will tell you that they aren't yours, right? 
@_date: 2013-06-05 02:59:20
On a dns level it's just like .onion, but tor is an entirely different thing.
@_date: 2013-05-03 13:00:45
Can OP pay the fee retroactively or is the transaction locked in at this point?
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:33:13
WTF does this mean? Is bitcoin a personality that Stewart can interview? this post belongs in @_date: 2013-05-17 01:15:47
Lost me at "Norton Secured."
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:14:49
Good point. I like to see the price go up, because it indicates popularity. I think that bitcoin has a lot of good to do for the world. Also I'm not complaining because I have had some bitcoins for a while now. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:40:16
Interesting. Are you concerned that the price might significantly drop anytime soon?
@_date: 2013-06-04 16:33:39
ok.... and this metaphor means that i shouldn't try to use private keys that aren't mine? or are you saying something else?
@_date: 2013-08-08 13:49:44
This is so obvious. It's like it doesn't need to be said. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:39:45
Sounds like you got it down. Call them up!
@_date: 2013-11-05 02:55:12
what's the data source?
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:36:09
I think the only thing that banks make is profits.

Stop trying to live a second class life with a microsoft os? There are better options. You deserve better.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:26:43
I see buying into "bitcoin" 2 ways. You can engage in currency speculation and buy bitcoins today and then sell them tomorrow when the value is higher. That's the first way, and I think the much more risky way. The other is to take advantage of its technology by investing in the community and promoting bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:45:42
phwoar? seriously, I'm confused. Do I say it out loud or scream it or what?
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:40:46
Oh yeah totally. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 05:11:35
How is bitcoin volatile by nature? 
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:23:38
Thanks. I hadn't thought of that. That's a good point.
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:06:49
la la laa....... Oh, hi, I'm part of the choir. What was it you were saying? 
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:27:19
That explains large price drops, but what keeps the price from dropping to zero?
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:33:00
Sort of, except that there are only 21 million. 
@_date: 2013-06-11 16:52:32
Not Bad, old fucker.
@_date: 2013-10-02 15:23:15
That makes sense.
@_date: 2013-10-01 13:33:59
Wait a second, Symantec actually does something?

Orange is the new black.
@_date: 2013-11-05 12:28:41
Neat. Thanks for the tip.

It looks like you have to convert usd into sll before you can buy btc. Can you go from USD &gt; BTC?
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:57:04
Me too, I'm still pretty cautious. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 04:16:02
it would even work on windows if you have cygwin.
@_date: 2013-05-12 02:27:20
Yes it was.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:35:43
I guess i was thinking that was significant. now I've confused myself. 
@_date: 2013-06-04 15:35:11
I am aware of the context of your comment, but I don't fully understand it what happened there from previous descriptions. Can you tell me what you mean by importing public "private" keys into the wallet?
@_date: 2013-05-03 18:50:23
Being new to BTC, how do I know if I own the coins? I realize that there aren't clawbacks like paypal has, but How can I avoid being scammed?
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:15:43
But why? 
@_date: 2013-11-30 14:08:42
wtf is bips? i never heard of it until this article asserted that bitcoin relies on it for stabililty. 
@_date: 2013-08-08 14:04:49
I guess the other part of my point was that people who need to be told aren't going to listen or understand anyway. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 17:23:14
I like this idea. How can This be a free bitcoin?
