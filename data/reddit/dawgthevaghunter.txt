Came here to post this article lol. Seems steep and a bit odd no? 10 BT in funding seems to be a lot to get before supporting  BT.

Just put I for a $100 purchase. Verified everything but the advanced (just learned about their wonky credit verification questions). So should be there in a few days fingers crossed.

At least the implications to this article implies they need physical access to the idevice to root it.

Was to me as well til I read the links associated with the tips. Just a way to really tip someone in bitcoin for something on Reddit. Neat little feature you should check it out. 
So I tipped .75 so you have .75 and the equivalent bitcoin from me and I think someone else gave you .10. So you have .85 and ~.27 in your wallet your officially over a dollar in equivalent bitcoin. Congrats!  We all start somewhere lol!

Very cool the more people who accept BT the better!  Cool art to boot!  
My story heard about BT for a long time and was one of the many who thought "meh" isn't going to amount to anything and boy was I wrong!  Should have gotten into it back them but dummy me didn't. So about a month ago really dug in and read up about it. Got some mini USB ASCI miners and made my first $100 purchase when it was around $430 and about 2-3 weeks later it's now over $1k it's really amazing.   Still a noob in many ways but learning more and more from this sub reddit. 
I also made my first purchase yesterday for the alpocas (sp?) socks lol to see how it all works.
