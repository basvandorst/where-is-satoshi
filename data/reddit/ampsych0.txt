Who is going to try it? If you try it , please, write your view on it. I am wondering does it worth it to try or not.

Thanks man. I was out of this staff. Great surprise! Haven't heard about it before. That's amazing how's everything changed since 2010.

That is really a problem. I think the best way to solve this problem is to spread BTC to mass. As there are more people who are involved in this there will be less people who don't trust this system

Well, that's good. I am curios why not to buy a gold? Why do you think silver  is better?

Well that can describe everything! If their safety system works the same no wonder why MtGox has been hacked.
