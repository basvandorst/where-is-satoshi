Bulls make money, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered. It's a market, ups and downs happen. I think most of us saw an impending market correction anyway, but future prospects are still strong.

That is true, but it is also true that the people who care about scientific advancement are often much wealthier than the average population, increasingly because it is science and technology where they made their money. I also think that people would be much better educated overall if we let schooling take place in a market setting.
But I suppose those are all moot, since I also don't believe the majority of people are ready to live without central authority guiding them. I'm at ancap ideally, but a minarchist realistically for now. And one of the rolls of a minimal government that I would support would be basic research. However I'm still holding out for Richard Branson and Elon Musk to get together and start a drive for the wealthiest to start taking an active role in spearheading some really advanced research. Or maybe to push a metamorphosis from a military industrial based economy to a research industrial based economy. A man can dream...

I'm also of the opinion that there is a general air of indifference that has been indoctrinated into society due to the fact that everyone assumes that the government will step in to fill the gaps. If that were not the default assumption, then I truly believe people would open their hearts and wallets to each other a lot more.

Ah, but who's to say NASA couldn't exist as a private organization? In the absence of taxes (not just income, but sales, gas, alcohol, indirect subsidy, etc) people would have far more income and the ability to choose where to put it. 
NASAs budget last year $18.7 billion. That is a per-capita funding of only $60. Only $60 from each American each year would fund nasa at current levels. Now I don't know about you, but I would donate far more than $60 to fund space research. Just look at the popularity of some of the space-related kick starters recently.
And even better: what if there were multiple NASAs? They could compete to be viewed as putting out the best science, cutting administrative overhead to a minimum, and putting the maximum amount of donations possible towards actual science.

My favorite part is in explaining the process, the author says that first the criminal must buy the bitcoin and then eventually turn it into "real money." 
As in a private fiat currency in a state of constant inflation that those attending the G8 have a vested interest in?
Or maybe they could have been talking about using BTC to buy gold. You know, maybe...

Plus there's already such a thing as volunteer fire departments, and they don't let people's houses burn down.
