Ah. I thought they'd got rid of that as a blanket restriction some time ago, but it looks like the only things someone with no affiliation to the US Forces can get are investments, life insurance and shopping discounts.

HD DVD should've been the winner, though, as it's a far superior technology. The only reason blu-ray came out on top was because of Sony: many people bought PS3s as a "cheap" blu-ray player when it came out, and they also publish a large quantity of movies themselves and have the ear of other studios.

[Here's a post I read the other day from a DVD menu author]( that gives a significant but often overlooked reason HD DVD could be considered better. Basically, it's a PITA to create a menu on blu-ray, while with HD DVD it's incredibly easy and uses widely known web standards. 
Aside from that, HD DVDs were much cheaper in every area: the disks were cheaper to manufacture as they didn't require a protective coating and the industrial writing process was much closer to DVDs and thus easy and cheap to change over to. Sure, blu-rays have bigger capacities and higher bitrates, but I can't see that those advantages have actually been used in any noticeable way.

You could try USAA. They do banking for the armed forces, but putting that aside they're the best bank I've ever had the pleasure of doing business with, in the US or the UK. You can manage everything online and over the phone, and as they don't have any ATMs of their own they will refund the fees (up to $15 pm).

By the pronunciation on that wiki shouldn't it be doh-jay?

What will this do for age verification? Many sites require a credit card to prove that you're over 18. I can easily see little Johnny convincing his technologically illiterate parents to buy him bitcoins to spend on something, but then he takes the coins and buys himself a porn account.

It's not really taking off in the UK, unfortunately.

The point gabridome was making is that they don't know the password at all, aside from an encrypted version of it, so they don't really have anything to give to the NSA or anyone. Now, if you were to argue that the NSA more than likely have the capability to crack that encryption, then you'd be going somewhere... (hint: they more than likely do)
