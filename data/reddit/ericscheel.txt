This sounds like the Ripple pitch. Does this mean the banks are going to reject Ripple?

If it is not money why do sites like coinmarketcap exist? Sure it is not government backed fiat money but it is still money at some level. 
@_date: 2016-08-30 16:04:11
Good point.

This idea is long dead. "Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote"  Imagine if every CPU actually had one vote in mining.

They closed my account for buying Bitcoin last year.

I am going to start using satoshis. I think § is a good symbol. Something like... "Hey I just purchased dinner for §50,000 Satoshi."

Not intentionally. I don't see how this is the issue. I often move $10,000+ in and out of my Wellsfargo account in non-bitcoin related transaction and it's never been an issue.

They did the same thing to all of my accounts at CapitalOne 360 about 8 months.  Including my kids college savings accounts.  
When I called them they refused to give me ANY reason for closing my account. I believe is was because of Bitcoin. The accounts had been open for almost 10 years via ING then CapitalOne360 and it was only a few months after I started using an account to buy Bitcoins via Coinbase that they closed all of my accounts. Someone at CapitalOne 360 does not like bitcoin.

Thank you for this clear explanation. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 18:30:06
I had someone say, "I saw on Fox News that the founder of Bitcoin was arrested." 
@_date: 2014-02-21 18:35:59
Same thing happened to me with CapitalOne360 with my 10 year old ING Account. How did you get them to tell you why they closed the account? CapitalOne360 would not give me any reason but its clearly related to my Coinbase activity.

Site looks like it is performing well.

Sounds like a good reason to take some profits. If you live in the US don't forget to pay applicable income/capital gains tax on your sale.

This is fantastic. He predicts the downfall of his future coin. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 01:00:50
LOL. My wife said this is exactly how I sound at a party trying to explain Bitcoin to her friends. 
@_date: 2016-12-16 23:32:04
Yes please.

I think proof-of-work is the digital equivalent of total-warfare. Access to raw materials and energy sources matter. 
@_date: 2017-04-22 13:40:15
Yes. In my mind it is a tradeoff between security and performance.

What changed is that showed respect to the Chinese mining community. In many ways, the segwit disagreement is about showing respect. 
@_date: 2017-04-23 21:05:39
There are many ways this could play out but here is part of the vision... 
@_date: 2017-04-22 13:37:04
I am not sure this is a good thing in the long run but it is the reality we live in today with POW concentrated in China.

Litecoin becomes the payment layer and Bitcoin becomes the settlement layer. Is that the future? Would that be so bad? 
@_date: 2016-05-05 12:54:14
So when is going to move the early coins? Waiting...
@_date: 2016-05-05 21:15:52
So how does this weigh into the recent drama?
@_date: 2016-07-17 14:13:58
I am a long time coinbase user and have been very happy. That being said I believe this is a very fair review. 
@_date: 2013-07-13 17:01:00
Worked perfect. Even pushed through orders that I had pending. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:50:04
I did not lose the money. They are sending to me. 
@_date: 2013-07-15 05:38:35
I use them. Works well from my perspective. Not as cutting edge from a tech/altcoin perspective as others but I would guess they are moving a little slow to make sure they keep everything within compliance.  
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:38:12
I have had this account for 10 years. The only thing that changed is I used it to buy bitcoins via Coinbase. The reason the banks will not tell anyone "why" is that they don't want a story about them cancelling accounts because of Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-06-23 16:15:30
This is crazy. CA needs to get their act together. The country that see Bitcoin as a value add will win a huge windfall.  
@_date: 2013-11-06 21:04:01
That is a good question. I don't think so but if they were rolled up across all of the accounts maybe but then why would they not tell me that in the letter? 
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:51:45
I had 1/2 dozen buys and no sells via coinbase. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 23:12:12
I have given out many paper wallets this year. 
@_date: 2013-07-12 17:54:10
Instant works great. They also took all of my orders in the queue and confirmed them all today. Clearing my backlog of purchases. When can get coinbase to support litecoins?
@_date: 2013-05-17 02:23:40
BitInstant worked but you pay more. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:17:23
A few thousand USD. Not big purchases.
