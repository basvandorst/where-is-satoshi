I trust the us government about as far as I can throw em

anyone else get the feeling coinbase/Gdax is about to take your money and run? So many people locked out for days, people cant make transfers, and I cant see and of the charts, 95% of charts are blank spaces. On an up note, tomorrow is friday and thats the buying day when people get paid so dont stress out yet.

I have no idea but usually people would (it seems) tell you to look up anthony antonopoulos and his videos 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:44:19
i made like.. .0002 BTC on the wave xD
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:26:26
This upsets me -_-
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:08:41
i bought at that exact same price yesterday and they didnt stop mine!?! :( for exactly 2k also!!
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:06:01
Far as I know coinbase is, at least I thought so. That's who I use and never ran into any issues so far
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:28:09
Its crashed or froze up like 4 times that I've seen in the last 24h at least. Too much hell breaking loose
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:13:24
feels like it though eh? :p
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:57:52
Far as I know if you transfer it to gdax there's no fee. I tested 2 weeks ago and didn't pay a fee and their website states that theres never a fee to transfer off BTC. If i recall correctly 
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:53:07
coinbase sends BTC for free. Just send it to GDAX first then withdraw it from there. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:50:17
Just make something up I don't know why it would really matter. Pick something common like food handler or something similar. Or other if there's any option
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:18:28
Im still a been at all this but over the last few months I've learned that more often that not these walls are false and we blow last them. Don't try to sell in front of them holding to get in before it drops. I did that because it was a wall of like 300 BTC and it was moving up very slowly and as soon as the prices met it vanished and the price shot up a few hundred.

You wish you were kidding? :p
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:52:08
the Volume of BTC traded each minute is less than what it was before we hit 19k and we weren't having a crash till after that. Is that signs of a DDOS or something of the sorts?
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:26:38
Know what else they can monitor? I'll give you a hint, its in my pants and also none of their business 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:46:59
You should be after the real culprit here, electric companies. Be mad at them for not creating enough renewable energy. We have the technology... That's like being mad at people for driving cars but not at the car companies that deliberately try to shut down any sort of electric car manufactures. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:10:50
be glad is stopped, chances are you just put up a sale order for what less than the buy price or it would post and then you would get locked out and end up baying back in at $500+. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:17:39
Thats up to you, whenever you decide your run is done and you want out. HODL seems to be more about not panic selling
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:53:05
Maybe has something to do with the exchange you are using? Like if its something based out of country? idk
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:08:35
Then they get mad because they expected to be able to buy in again and get locked out. This mayhem is unseen before and then they get mad at coinbase for it. Its hard to prepare for the unseen and who knows how hard it is for them to quickly upgrade their systems in a weeks time and at what $ cost
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:06:45
i dunno what would happen. My dad lost all his retirement to Enron and he got nothing in return and I dont think there was anyone to sue
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:40:25
Hmm.. So what's being a college student have to do with their verification process?
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:18:00
well...I do keep a phone in there?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:58:40
must mean the asshats causing this mayhem are in the US
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:07:02
Been wondering this myself, its almost irritating honestly and makes me worried about a major crash.  I sold half at $11,700 and then it went up so quick and didn't stop so I had to buy in at $12,800
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:27:42
like the government took something like $1.6 billion a few years back, maybe theyre trying to crash it :p
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:32:49
Ya lost me, how are those two related? Gdax uses the verification from coinbase doesn't it? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:38:12
How is the price dropping when both sites are down
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:27:28
Looks like testicles for dinner tonight
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:49:32
I've lost and missed out on a lot of money at this point over the last few days and it doesnt help that coinbase lies about 4 day transaction times. I've been quite irritated the last few days by bitcoin tbh
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:01:31
I've been in this only 2 months so im not sure but far as I know, not really.  Most people on this sub look at coinbase / GDAX
