Doesn't mimble wimble theoretically avoid double-spends without a history?

Mining won't be their core business. And of course they will keep mining if it will earn them money. But don't expect anything big.

If you are the highest bidder in the auction they promise to only give you the data. It would be up to the bidder to use it or not.
@_date: 2016-08-15 18:57:04
No, they mean 1 million btc.
@_date: 2016-08-15 18:59:09
It is an open auction. They didn't ask for any specific amount of btc to sell the data.
If they raise one million btc from all participants they would release to the public.

Thank you for the clarification. How do you sign transaction then? Is it something like this?:
1. I log into bitwala
2. I enter the details
3. Bitwala sends the encrypted private key to my browser
4. I enter the password that the key is encrypted with
5. My browser sings the transaction locally and sends it back to bitwala
6. Bitwala broadcasts the transaction to nodes
It was hard to understand from the website and your comments what exactly is going on. If the wallet is implemented like this it seems secure to me, but I'm no security expert.

I also experienced one bitclub network member coming to my local bitcoin meetup.
From the beginning it was clear that he did not know much about bitcoin at all. Despite him claiming to have 'done his research.
His strategy then was explain him technical background of wallets and mining and then mentioning that this is exactly how bcn works.
It is always a big red flag if someone doesn't share the excitement of possibilites of bitcoin, blockchain technology in general and decentralization, but on the other hand be very involved in a bitcoin business.

The only fee that should concur is the bitcoin transaction fee. 
The whole process should be trustless with no middleman required.
It is explained here:

In other words: We don't know the core business of their new bitcoin business. Only that it won't be bitcoin mining.

As mentioned, you are thinking about the now defunct altcoin exchange cryptsy.com
In this case crypsys is referring to the Cryptographic Systems Group of the MMCI cluster of the Saarland University.
Coinshuffle is a proof of concept from 2014 of this institute.
This is even visible from the url I linked to. Sometimes I question the basic logic and google skills of some users here..

Coinshuffle is explained quite nicely here:

Well, while the bitwala wallet looks better than many other webwallets, it remains a wallet where I share the keys with a company.
I'm not sure if I understood everything right, but it looks like that the user basically can only backup the keys. If you guys get hacked the coins are lost.

Why are bitcoin wallet developers building any new features? To get more users.

The goal of a britcoin is not to replace bitcoin, but rather to replace things like swift that bitcoin (currently at least) is not able to replace.

Currently 15,814,500 BTC exist. The maximum amount of BTC to ever exist is 21 million.
@_date: 2016-08-16 05:33:17
The 1 million leaks additional data, not the data for sale.

What? Your comment has nothing to do with this.
