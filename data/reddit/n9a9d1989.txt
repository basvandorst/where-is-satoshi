that actually makes more sense than any other bs you hear on the news. Believe in what you invested and stop trying to convince yourself wallstreet is shorting your asset

If you are on IOS there is a nice app that already exists called Coin Ticker. Helps you create portfolios with the amount of coins you hold and shows you your profit in real time. Been using it for a while now.
But anyway good job on the app !

Kind of a sadistic personality aren't you now ? :)
You should know that in our world, everything you right down on internet is available to everyone. That being said, you shouldn't be shocked that I checked your history It helped me understand your personnality. I was trying to figure out whether you are the type of person that is helping the community or just a trolling one. Your answer only confirms what I thought, and removes all credibility to your opinion. You are not giving a constructive point of view, you just enjoy seeing other people losing their money. That is sick man.
Oh and I couldn't care less about how you live your life, I just hope that new investors won't be fooled by your bitter opinion.

Yes I would advise you to move at least 70% of your crypto wallet there, and keep the rest on the exchange of your choice to trade eventually.
Did you try your luck with Trezor ? They say it's a good alternative to the nano ledger

I always keep in mind that I bought in for the future and not to sell it after 6 months. I intend to hold it for at least 2-3 years, tough thing to do especially when you have 5 figures invested but so far it has worked pretty well. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:47:48
You should. Don't forget that also need a proper understanding of fromage before doing so.

This is bad. If we want mass adoption we need them to be rational about their investment and not dreamy. Gulable people might never come back in the crypto market if they lose it all.

Mt Gox just lit the panick button. The rest is just weak hands selling at loss. Remember Bitcoin sneezes, alts get the flue
@_date: 2018-03-16 14:28:57
as in the next big exchange plateform for cryptos on mobile
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:14:33
Because price going up means demand is going up, means adoption rate is increasing. Which is the whole purpose of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-29 12:53:24
But it might go up...

aside from their shitty customer service, CB was actually a good app and also very user friendly. At the time it was the only secure and well known app that provided this kind of service. When they added bcash without notifying their customer base in advance, thats when they f*cked up. Now thanks to Abra we have a nice alternative to get into the crypto world easily.

I don't fully agree there. I remember that time when it dipped in september-octobre, Coinbase would be unavailable like Kraken. That was when i decided to move out my coins to my personal cold storage ledger.
I do agree that Coinbase is a great gate to get into the crypto world pretty fast (as soon as you get verified). But when they brutaly added Bcash without warning their customer base thats when they lost me along with many other users.

We all want the same thing, global adoption. In order to get there we need stability. If the price spikes up, it will definitely spike down right after. Howerver steady growth may (or may not, but still has more chances to do so) lead to a stable value.
I hear you, the dumping is annoying, but keep in mind that with smart money invested those whales have less impact when they start to manipulate the market. With "dumb" money it is very easy to push that panic sell button.
@_date: 2018-03-21 10:40:46
I don't agree there. You need to take into account the global feeling of buyers and sellers. If you gain 100% in value very fast in this volatile market, you will be tempted to cash out because you expect a correction.
Wherease a steady growth is healthy and attracts smart money for long time investment.

I also wanted to diversify and NVIDIA seems a pretty good bet. AMD too although they are suffering from the Intel security issue...
Consensy looks like a very promising start up around blockchain applications and usecases.

I was checking your profile history buddy. You seem bitter and desperate to prove your point. If you don't believe in the tech why are you even bothering and coming back?
I hate curling... truely I find it to be the dumbest sport ever. That being said, you won't see me posting and hating on their sub. I would rather check on topics that really interest me and peaks my curiosity (like Bitcoin). Cheers !

The whole point behind GDPR is to protect customer data. Blockchain technology enables it in a very disruptive and trustless system. This could be another leap forward for mass adoption, especially with the recent Facebook scandal.

You should try Bcash Massala
