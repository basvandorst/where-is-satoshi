Wrong. That's what I thought too. But wrong. There is no magic. You can't change the reality. The things that you thought as magical, are just millions of small tweaks on reality that stacked up each other so much so that it looks like magic. 
%99 of the time you can't create something new. Most of the time you are unable to do so or you don't need to. %99 of the time you will find yourself tweaking the existing thing as opposed to creating a new one and the reason for that is because you can't. It is so fucking hard to create something new. 
If all the engineers/inventors/singers etc tried to create completely new things we would be at least 50 years back still. We came this far by tweaking, iterating and improving the existing shit.

Why this the last part of this sentence didn't make sense although it feels it perfectly should.

Lol so what? What the fuck matter even if our collective debt is a billion times more than our economy assuming that they are comparable. And how the fuck btc is solution for that?? Lmaoo they don't even know what they're talking about. 
Here is the thing boys. Btc is useful cuz it allows faster transmission of the money without third party trust. And none of the fucking economic problems that we have today not related to this. So stop fucking bullshiting.
