As soon as it went live that was the live price, a couple trades happen maybe not many though. Then it was disabled and the price dropped 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:48:01
Talk about a bounce

Prepare to wait a while, or they could just not give out the b2x at all.
Fun fact: The creator of Coinbase and the creator of Blockchain.info were business partners. Blockchain.info guy said people should have control of their private keys, Coinbase creator disagreed, so they parted ways.

That's nice... now Coinbase users can sell their bch that they had no access to.
*takes sip of tea*
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:57:20
There's no doubt. Same thing happen with Litecoin, the night before it went on Coinbase the price shot up big time.
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:29:05
Welcome to Heaven.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:35:37
Just hodl. Obviously people are gonna want free b2x when the fork happens on the 28th.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:56:31
Coinbase should be ashamed of themselves letting people buy bch for $9k. They should've known their software was glitching 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:16:32
The $20k isn't coming easy, but it's coming. Then it will surpass DOW and mainstream media will eat it up
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:29:10
There's nothing ethical about investing. 
Let's not forget investing is gambling without the negative connotation 
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:06:26
What will hit $25k first, DOW or BTC ?
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:30:51
The fees on Coinbase are ridiculously high. I tell people with Coinbase accounts to transfer to gdax and withdraw there for free.
Which ponders the question if they can do it for free on gdax why don't they do it for free on Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:33:41
This $20k isn't gonna come easy is it
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:42:16
It's possible. But the real manipulation will happen when btc overtakes the dow
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:44:47
The one that was halted in November. It's back
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:42:19
Gonna end the night at $16,900.25
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:25:09
Just opened a short position at $7k. Just need it to drop below that and I'm good
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:20:10
I'm done trading for the year. Hodl time
@_date: 2014-01-23 22:20:35
Silly me, wanting something I paid for!
@_date: 2014-01-06 17:36:13
I'm in the same situation, I hate it. All you can do is switch everything with a Visa or wait for them to accept Mastercard.
@_date: 2014-01-18 01:23:10
That news about ebay UK accepting Bitcoin is pretty sweet. Imagine selling stuff for Bitcoin
edit: After writing this comment I looked for auction sites that use Bitcoin, I found [this](
@_date: 2014-01-23 19:36:38
I should have waited for them to return my call, but I was angry at the time and wasn't thinking. I called them at 10am, they returned my call and left voicemail at 7pm (although by then I had already called Burger King so it was too late). How long did it take you to talk to someone?
@_date: 2015-01-23 23:16:11
Imagine how the people that bought at $1,200 are feeling. Anyway, it's the nature of the beast, in fact the first run up to $1,200 may not have been real. There were bots on MtGox apparently. Bitcoin has grown a lot since then, with huge companies investing huge money into it. If you want your money back then sell by all means, but if it is investment money I'd suggest you hang on to it and hopefully you'll get your $600 back.
@_date: 2015-01-29 17:12:01
You should never take a loan out for an investment, and honestly no matter what these sites say don't trust them. Buy, sell, on there and then watch after your coins yourself. It was something like 774,000 coins lost at MtGox, it could happen to any of those sites.
@_date: 2015-01-25 14:13:50
Well let's see: 
-Saddam said he would no longer accept USD for oil, and was switching to Euros.
We invaded and he was killed.
-Goddafi said he would only accept gold for oil sales.
We invaded and he was killed.
So what do you think?
@_date: 2015-01-25 21:03:28
Damn, that does sound like something NYSE would do.
@_date: 2015-01-27 00:44:41
I assume the person wearing it is anti-Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-30 23:49:53
I've never heard of BitUSD and I just looked it up.
It looks fucking incredible tbh.
@_date: 2015-01-18 00:34:29
1) There are people paying $350?
2) No Coinbase?
@_date: 2015-01-21 11:29:32
There's an altcoin that's been gaining steam in that industry. [Sexcoin](
@_date: 2015-01-26 00:29:10
I'm glad to see this :)
@_date: 2015-01-25 10:01:35
This is a hard question because there are no guarantees it will keep going up and all that. But, if it ever hits $1,000 again 1000btc would equal $1 million. So I guess that's a good number
@_date: 2015-01-30 19:07:29
You're right. Not just with Bitcoin though, with other altcoins too, heck, even with gold. 
For the first time money is not in control by banks. And the higher Bitcoin goes, the value of USD and other currencies will go down. Interesting times indeed.
@_date: 2015-01-26 11:12:07
That's good stuff!
@_date: 2015-01-28 01:45:41
Who knows how many are lost.. Obviously if anyone knew how valuable they'd be things would've been different. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 20:04:21
It's margin, they don't care what you do with it as long as you pay it back (or don't pay it back and then they get more interest).
@_date: 2015-01-26 14:13:38
Yeah, well the exchange isn't available in my state
@_date: 2017-08-06 02:30:11
I want it ��
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:24:29
It's like a penny stock that somehow goes over $1.00
Imo penny stocks are regulated to where people that can afford penny stocks are never supposed to be able to afford $10k+ stocks. There will probably never be another Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-03 18:09:45
Hope you're having a great day OP!
@_date: 2015-02-01 18:25:36
Those investors that are in it now seem pretty promising. It's not like people can say, "Oh NYSE has always invested millions into Bitcoin." Like, no, these are new interests.
@_date: 2013-12-21 16:18:10
How can someone call Netseller, Paypal, their bank, etc. and say the words "Oh whoops, give me back the money please." Take some accountability. The companies should say let's hear both sides first. 
I hope everything works out for you. $85,000.00 doesn't just come out of thin air, let them track it somewhere, this is crazy.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:07:50
Anyone that calls this place a circlejerk is wrong. I've seen lots of anti-Bitcoin comments being upvoted. Both sides are being heard.
@_date: 2013-12-19 14:37:30
Omg, yes!
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:24:28
Right, it's annoying when I hear people saying there are day-traders in the bitcoin market. And people shorting it too. It is kind of setup like a stock, but I hope people would consider it currency only.
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:51:45
I didn't see any of this coming. I actually put an order on Coinbase on Monday (my first time using their service). They have a 4 day waiting period, so since Monday I've been seeing it go down.. I'm hoping by the time I get the order on Friday it can go back up to at least $750.00 per coin. I am not panicking though..
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:33:42
I made this post earlier, it got downvoted but still..
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:16:43
Yes, whatever price that is locked at the time is the price that stays. For me that was $750 :-/
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:02:33
Yes, now is a good time, it hasn't been this low in a long time. If you want to give the China situation a week or so to balance out that's probably a good idea too, I just have a feeling any day now it's either going to shoot up or shoot down. Some new news will happen soon.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:59:37
This is unrelated, but a couple a days ago I saw someone on here saying that Chase told them they will not allow any more transactions involving bitcoins.
Ironically, Chase is now creating their own anonymous payment service
@_date: 2013-12-20 22:21:35
I hope you find the guy, he's in some serious shit. It's getting to the point where unless someone puts cash in your hand you gotta doubt everything else.
@_date: 2013-12-22 01:13:04
Well I will tell you this, obviously savings accounts are an easy thing to mock. The best bank will give you 0.05% or maybe 1% if you're lucky, per year. So it seems like anything is better than that. But the savings account is guaranteed, investing isn't. Me personally, I'd put it into bitcoins, but you shouldn't invest anything you wouldn't mind losing.
@_date: 2013-12-14 19:51:49
This is great!

I feel like anytime someone talks about other cryptocurrencies, LTC usually the most, they straightaway say they're the silver to Bitcoin's gold. Bitcoin is the gold standard in cryptocurrencies. Huge firms, multi-millionaires are sitting on their investments watching it, I can't imagine them switching all their money somewhere else.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:17:10
I've wondered about trading specifically overnight since China is awake while we're asleep. Probably lots of action at that time.
@_date: 2013-12-21 20:06:06
You'll make lots of people happy with a $500 price. Another way to sell as much as you like is to put a sell order on Coinbase.
