This is the same mentality that I witnessed during the dot com bubble (and 08 housing crash). People with little to no experience hoping the stock market would change there lives and give them financial freedom. Most likely this approach will end in tears and panic selling. If you hold a rather negative attitude as it seems you do, trading in a highly speculative market is not wise. Takes confidence, discipline and experience for most people to make money trading.

Nah, while it’s a giant amount, it’s only $6.8 Trillion based on the approximate 17 million coins in existence. The US M2 supply is just shy of $14T. If bitcoin is accepted globally and used as a primary currency and adopted en mass, then it is absolutely possible in terms of available global money supply.

After the first hundred or so impacts, you hardly feel it!

Not necessarily. If you’re able to actually purchase some of the rare supercars, they actually go up in value, often times significantly. Most people can’t even buy a new Ferrari until you’ve owned a used one these days unless you pay a huge markup. Most of these cars hold their value quite well compared to sub $200k vehicles. Take the $1.5M Le Ferrari as an example and look at the resale prices.
