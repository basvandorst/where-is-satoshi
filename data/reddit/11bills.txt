Hey, financialization is complicated and has many different meanings. The ones I wrote about I think are not desirable in any economy. 








Bad because: 
1. an increase in mortgaged backed security profits (counted as GDP) does not create jobs.
2. Examples of financially motivated decisions are using profits to buy company stock, and highly leveraged stock compensation packages for CEO's. These together reduce re-investment and produce bad long term economic results anyway you cut it.
3. ~
4. I believe the focus on the stock market as a determinant of the business cycle is a destabilizing factor. 
If by financialization you are referring to: 
Increasing the availability of credit to entrepreneurs, and growth businesses. 
Increasing the stability and predictability of retirement. 
Accelerating access and reducing the costs of global financial services. 
Then I would be pro financialization. I believe that Bitcoin is key to realizing positive financialization.

In the fiat system Banks are able to increase the money supply by creating loans, bitcoin alters that paradigm completely (banks earn interest on money they don't actually have). - Bitcoin takes ownership of money away from the government and the banking system and moves it to the people who hold the money. Of course that threatens banks. You don't get it.

In order for the Bitcoin rich to get more Bitcoin (sustain their wealth); they need to provide a service to others. Rather than earning millions by buying government debt, mortgage backed securities, etc. Every time the Bitcoin rich spend there bitcoin (to achieve whatever end) their share of the market, and their power diminishes. This is the idea of decentralized money. 
We currently have a system where wealth alone sustains more wealth. Bitcoin won't work that way.

This isn't true, data stored by maidsafe is broken into pieces and the pieces are stored in different vaults (the vaults are maintained by farmers who contribute space to the network in return for safecoin). Each piece of data is stored multiple times so if one site storing the data is taken down another will automatically be created by the network in another location. The data stored on your computer is both encrypted and incomplete (obfuscated). In theory this is true peer-to-peer anti-fragile data storage that cannot be taken down by targeting any single entity and its structure is distinct from the other options (I2P, freenet) that people have been calling the same thing.

I'm positing that future and here are some thoughts to answer Jeronimus: 
Because Bitcoin is a decentralized, deflationary currency, wealth is not self sustaining. Yes Satoshi and the other early adopters hold a large portion of the wealth now, but as they realize that wealth (spend it) their market power is reduced. In our system the very wealthy can sustain their wealth by holding government bonds and various other financial assets that give return with no risk. If you have billions of dollars, you can sustain that wealth, and live off the millions in earnings. In a Bitcoin economy, the only way to sustain your wealth is by investing in productive ways, by producing something that others in the Bitcoin community value and are willing to pay for. Market forces create more wealth for everyone. 
Plus, adoption will take place over an extended period, eventually reaching a limit at all economic activity. Early adopters gain the most, but anyone who adopted before the limit will gain on their investment. Thus although it is a transfer of wealth, it is not coercive. It is voluntary. The nature of Bitcoin is to tear down all barriers to trade among individuals, and it is very well agreed that freer trade will produce more wealth for everyone.

50% isn't a magic number - at 40% they could still build a competing chain if that is their intention (less probability to succeed but still significant) - creating 'laws' that bitcoin miners must obey is not an effective way to deal with this problem and completely against the ethos Bitcoin represents (see the trollish post below on regulation).
There is no need to react suddenly because Ghash has no incentive to attack the network they are undoubtably long Bitcoin and don't forget they are securing our network vs other possibly unknown attackers. The market incentives and way mining hardware has evolved is pushing small miners out.

Which are a direct result of the un-accoutability &amp; mal-incentives of the fiat system. Imagine a world where banks actually had to have money in order to lend it. A system not perpetuated by debt, where every unit of the currency is owned instead of borrowed and no-one has the ability to enrich themselves at the expense of others. Crypto-currency creates trust between people rather than requiring trust to a third party.

Hey thanks for your comment. I recognize that the deflation trap is an existential problem for Bitcoin, but I think deflationary collapses in the past should be viewed in context (deflation was not the only cause). I do think it is reasonable to question if ALL deflation is necessarily a bad thing. If an economy grows, the wealth increase is shared between all actors who hold currency in that economy. 
The question is: "Is expansionary monetary policy the only type of government policy that can solve the problem of hoarding?" I think that is not true.  is an interesting alt-coin because it charges demurrage on it's coins. Demurrage's aim is to prevent hoarding (because your coins degrade - think nuclear isotope) and encourage zero interest loans. Could taxation through demurrage in a crypto-currency world solve this problem?

Couldn't agree more: 
The first wave of investment into Bitcoin was technical experts and internet users with only passing interest (hard drives in landfills). The technology provided a proof-of-concept. The protocol showed stability. 
The second wave of investment into Bitcoin is driven by young men (mostly) looking to find the next big shift, libertarian visionaries, and some small professional investors with huge buying power compared to the size of the market. 
The third wave will be users who buy it because it is useful. Your article speaks to the beginning of this.

He is talking about the Bretton Woods agreement in which the USD was convertible to gold and all other currencies had to maintain a fixed exchange rate to the USD. The United States was undoubtedly in a very powerful bargaining position after WWII and used that position to create a US centered system. When it became apparent that far more money had been created than could ever be converted to gold the US unilaterally closed the gold window in 1971 and the era of pure paper money began.

Colored coins offer the possibility that equity in a company could be sold directly by a company to investors with 100% of the sale going to the company raising money (yes you have to trust the company you're investing in, well duh)
Bitcoin offers the opportunity for businesses to have financial interaction directly with other businesses, no middleman, near zero fees. Borders would not create more financial costs as you are required to convert from one government paper to another. 
These things were not possible a few years ago. Now they are possible. These outcomes are more efficient and better for every business that isn't a bank. Maybe you're right "most Bitcoin proponents do not think that system will ever exist." - but that doesn't mean it won't.

Other side of the same coin - they were expecting (betting) that the value of the home would be able to cover the remainder of the loan in the event of default. That is how they were able to justify packaging them as AAA securities. They had basically no procedure to verify the borrower so I would argue the bet was primarily on the housing market. But the important point is that they knew it was actually crap regardless of the rating &amp; they packaged it and sold it to pension funds, their clients, foreign investors, 'useful idiots' and made windfall profits. And then to put icing on the cake when it collapsed, they were bailed out by taxpayer money, no criminal charges. Scolded, fined then business as usual...

As I understand it, this change removes the incentive of having smaller blocks (right now a smaller block is more likely to be included by the network in the blockchain (and giving the miners reward) because the smaller the block the more quickly it will propagate through the network). This change will put downward pressure on the minimum fee/transaction-kb because it removes the disincentive of including transaction - all blocks will propagate at essentially the same rate. This will help with scalability but is not a silver bullet.

What is interesting about this is a lot (actual figures require too much work) of trade in the USD does not occur within US borders. Basically all global oil sales are denominated in US currency - even out of countries like Venezuela and Russia. Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Australia, Canada all sell in USD. Oil isn't alone in being denominated in USD. All of this is support for US government policy as OP said.
The USDs value is supported by its role as the global reserve currency, but every year the economy of the globe grows quicker than the US economy. So every year we set a record for the smallest (relative) economy ever supporting a global reserve currency. You have to think that it is impossible for that to continue forever. 
The creation of the Euro was an attempt to create a viable alternative. The Chinese government sure has high hopes for their currency taking on a more important role. Many people advocate for a gold backed global currency. All of these solutions are lacking in my view. Digital, decentralized scarcity offers a level playing field for all nations, and eliminates the need for trust (escrow) in international trade. And provides no opportunity for politics to leverage power from the system. 
This is the main reason I have such an idealistic belief that Bitcoin has huge potential to fundamentally change everything about international finance. Thanks for the reminder OP !

Credit in a crypto-currency is inherently different than credit in a fiat currency, because you actually have to have the money in order to lend it. I do not believe that this is necessarily a bad thing or an impossible obstacle to overcome.
The credit market has been extremely distorted by our government. (Fannie &amp; Freddie)
I think a free market for credit can be established using the blockchain as proof of lending / contract, but market size &amp; stability must be established first. The role of a credit market is to connect savers with borrowers and compensate the savers proportional to the risk of the investment. Killer app? Hopefully Satoshi is working on it.

Hey, thank you furling. 
You are right that the argument we are having is based on a theoretical world where Bitcoin is the only currency. We are supposing that deflation (increase in the value of Bitcoin because of an increase in total economic activity) puts downward pressure on money velocity, and slower money velocity causes more deflation, which puts more downward pressure on velocity, and so on until there is no longer a functioning currency, and this creates severe economic consequences.
This problem is a long time out, but discussing it and understanding it within this community is important.

A deflationary currency, yes. A crypto-currency, no.
In our system, banks are able to affect the money supply by changing the reserve ratio. Most money in our economy is not printed by the government but is created by the banking system which loans out much more money than they actually have (and charge interest on all of it). Unless people choose to deposit their Bitcoin in a bank (rather than in a bitcoin wallet, cold storage, phone, etc), the fractional reserve money creation does not happen.

It's hard to explain in a little forum conversation why I believe in Bitcoin in the long term. Money is the most monopolized asset ever created and the monopolists (governments) want us to believe that without their guiding hand we would all be fucked. 
The institution of pure paper money has not been around very long, and there are several examples of hyperinflation in which governments abused the trust of their citizens. 
The US dollar is the world reserve currency now, but is that reality going to last forever? Every year the rest of the worlds economy grows significantly faster than the US economy. 
Now, I could be wrong and non of this could come to pass, but what some Chinese officials (who are notoriously corrupt and could be doing this specifically in order to buy) are saying is irrelevant.

The argument is something like this: Bitcoin changes the paradigm of money so that the barrier to enter a global financial system is only as high as a cell phone. Even in the poorest parts of the world, cell phone ownership is going to be ubiquitous in 25 years. They will have access to international transfers, buying power locks to foreign currencies, and the ability to sell goods digital or otherwise with no fees, &amp; no extra equipment. 
On the other end of the spectrum there is literally trillions in wealth perpetuated by government loans. If a family owns hundreds of millions of dollars of government loans, they can live off the interest forever without providing one cent of value to the economy. The governments unlimited buying power creates this risk free wealth perpetuation that only the very rich can participate in. If money is neutral, if money is owned by the individual in the same way it is owned by the government; instead of this asymmetric power that is used to protect monopolies, our economy will be changed fundamentally.

Hey, thanks for taking the time to read what I wrote and comment. You're a little rough, but this is the internet (gloves off!)
The goal of all this is exchange, but my point is that the type of money affects who exchanges and who benefits from that exchange. I'm arguing that the monetary choices that have been made in recent history are distorting the real economy in a way that is beneficial to some. If I accept that inflation is necessary (I don't fully), why can't the new money be distributed to each citizen in the economy equally? Who really benefits from zero interest rate policy? The point I was trying to make is that monetary policy has important impacts on our economy and the decisions made on monetary policy should be apart of the democratic process, not controlled by a private central bank. 


This is a really great example of being stuck in a paradigm. Fiat money is credit. Fiat money has ushered in a world of debt, debt, debt . . . mortgage, credit card, business, junk bonds, treasury bonds, city debt, state debt, default swaps, debt backed securities. . . . the amount of debt in our economy is hard to understand. I believe one of the influences pushing our society towards all of this debt is the inflationary environment. Debt will always be worth less in the future, so borrow. Going very deep into debt to buy a house is considered prudent financial planning and is heavily encouraged by the government. Does debt destabilize our economy? Is debt essential to a functioning economy? Both of these questions are fair and worth talking about. 


I really have to disagree with you here. More money has been produced in the 21st century than in the entire history of the United States. Doesn't that scare you just a little?


I won't, Bitcoin is the answer :0


You are re-enforcing my point. We have been targeting inflation in an environment where prices should be naturally falling. So we are printing money to account for: the growth of the economy + the natural deflation because of productivity + our arbitrary inflation target. Could this extra money in the economy be fuelling the bubbles that have caused a lot of real economic pain?


Why does who I can trade with depend on which side of an imaginary line I was born on? The nations role is to provide desired services to it's people. Security, safety, fairness. Our officials are not some tin god reigning their will upon us. We still live in a democracy, change can happen here without violence.

Political / ideological rejection of the status quo. The average person on the street does not think very highly of our banks, central banks and politicians. 
Something will break the camels back: sovereign debt bubble? another trillion $ bailout, widespread identity theft, backlash vs political sanctions, continued excessive profits, pervasive high unemployment. Bitcoin is a political movement towards the separation of money &amp; state. I think it will succeed.

If you are more interested in analyzing the blockchain and producing metrics and data analysis then I would recommend python as the way to go. It was my first language and the syntax is very friendly and python has an amazing array of data analysis tools.

@_date: 2014-07-15 17:07:24
Hi, to combine the wallet without getting charging a fee you need to work with the private keys (it's a small amount so it is a good way to learn). You can export the private keys out of 2 of the wallets then import them into the third. How to do this depends on which wallet you are using. 
Sending a transaction with too low a fee will cause your transaction never to be confirmed, so I don't recommend that.

Now there are more sellers and the price is dropping. We are in a period of extreme volatility, bitcoin never advertised as a good short term store of value. 
I don't give a damn what the price is in summer 2014, lets look forward. Where will we be in 2024, 2044, 2064? I've come to the conclusion that the blockchain will still exist then; supporting a scarce, secure token with thousands of applications built on top of it.

I have sympathy for both sides of the blocksize cap argument, and both sides are trying to make the choice that builds the strongest bitcoin but they define that success differently so it is hard to agree on a path forward. It is interesting to watch. It should ultimately be an engineering decision not a pr decision so I defer to the experts.

@_date: 2015-05-19 23:19:18
It's interesting to wonder how much fractional reserve lending has contributed to the technological advancement over the past century. The correlation of fractional reserve banking with massive technological expansion should not be mistaken for causation, but you can certainly build a case that it was. 
I think where we differ (referring to your manifesto) is in our belief of the roll of government when you say: 


•The reserve ratio should be drastically increased.
You are relying on the government to make decisions that curtail the financial industry. You are giving the government great leverage on the economy. If you have fractional reserve lending, then you have deposit default risk, then you look to the government to socialize that risk. I have come to the conclusion that that is a toxic dynamic because money has such great influence over political decisions. Separation of money and state seems to me as, if not more important than separation of church and state. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 22:38:03
I agree with you, I'm surprised that pro-regulation posts in this thread are so up-voted. Coinbase has all sorts of government approval, but have they passed a cryptographic proof-of-reserve? Do they intend to? Free market solutions can create trust (because of the blockchain); government regulation (20th century trust) is expensive, possibly corrupt, and time consuming. This community should fight traditional regulation schemes every step of the way.
@_date: 2015-01-05 03:52:20
I think you underestimate how much the system of state money has been co-opted by special interest groups and self serving policy. Banks today use their privilege of fractional reserve lending to an excessive extent, compound that with opaque financial instruments, the systematic expansion of debt (gov, company, &amp; personal) and  the regulators are under complete regulatory capture. On top of that states are more and more using their control of money to manipulate economic activity &amp; achieve political goals. These trends have gotten a lot worse over the past few decades, for me Bitcoin is pushback against the politicizing of money. People should care how their money works.
@_date: 2014-02-18 23:49:04
You mis-understand what Bitcoin is. We can have a democratic money, not by voting for it (that is keeping central control), but simply by exercising our freedom to choose which money to hold &amp; trade in.

Thanks for the thoughtful response. Of course the premise that there should be less debt in the economy can be viewed from many perspectives. I focused on the instability and risk that debt carries with it. In my view a readjustment of the consumerism of our society is not all bad either. Buying things from your savings is a silly thing to do if your savings depreciate, but if your savings appreciate it changes the equation. This also gives the consumer more time to reflect on the value he is getting. The get it now, pay later culture is not all positive. 
As for the ability to control the cash flow saving us. Nearly all of those examples are saving us from bank collapses.

I think it is going to be very difficult for an exchange  market (BTC/fiat) to function in the same way a traditional foreign exchange market functions. Even merchants who sell there goods exclusively for btc (darkweb markets for example) continue to use dollars as the unit of account. The volatility is too severe for it to fulfill that function of money. As of now the entire market cap of bitcoin would not qualify as a 'deep and liquid market' in the forex world so one cannot expect that to develop anytime soon. However what is interesting about the crypto-currency space is that the technology allows for new types of solutions to be developed that operate in a completely different way but find solutions to the same problems. The btc derivatives market is growing and I expect this year that space will see a lot of innovation and growth, giving vendors a reliable way to accept btc directly and hedge the currency risk.

To create btc it costs resources nearly equal to the amount earned. Yes this creation (inflation) drives the price down, but it was designed to increase distribution in the early stages(yes it is still early). Btc is a currency that allows wealth to easily cross borders, opens access to p2p marketplaces, enables microtransactions over the internet, enables applications/software to directly interact financially with each other. If you view it as an investment and wish there was a dividend, you aren't the type of person who should be buying btc.

“You really need to consider what money is. As we go into the future—10 years, 20 years, 30 years—the money supply of all the major currencies is going to continue to increase and, on average, the price of everything is going to go up. That’s just the nature of our current money system. Bitcoin is a fundamentally different money system that over time will remain constant. Over time, if it continues to exist—I believe the technology is strong enough—then it will become recognized as a store of value that is better than a traditional currency.”

The idea is lighthouse is run completely decentralized. The pledges are all collected as valid bitcoin transactions but the outputs (in bitsquares case 120BTC) are chosen before hand. The transaction is only valid if enough outputs are collected. In this way you are guarenteed by the bitcoin blockchain to only donate your pledge if the funding goal is reached. Decentralized crowdfunding, no middle-man, no fees.

In order to trace it they need a point when the pseudonymity is broken (exchanges are that point now) - if all transactions are peer-to-peer (even business-to-business, business to customer) and all individuals act to protect there own privacy, then there isn't a point of orientation to trace from and perfect fungibility is likely.
Also on the other side of the coin if government is forced to use bitcoin then the public does have that point of orientation and all government spending is 100% traceable. That could eliminate a disgusting amount of corruption all over the world.

(From the lightning mailing list)      
Hi all!               
As you know, I designed a lightning variant which used only non-experimental, in-planning BIPs[1].  One assumption was BIP62: in particular, that anchor malleability wouldn't be an issue.  This was flawed; BIP62 will never be deployed.            
                      
There are several options from here:
* 1) Ignore it.  Malleated txs are non-standard.
* 2) Add a timeout to the anchor.  Limits the lifetime of the channel, and still means if it does happen you have to wait for the timeout.
* 3) Propose a reduced BIP62 which (say) only protects P2PKH, for a
   specific transaction version.
* 4) Take a leap of faith and assume Segregated Witness fixes all
   malleability.
I was debating between  and  for a while, but eventually settled on   Here's why:            
* 1) While still pre-BIP, Pieter Wuille is working on a prototype now (Luke Jr came up with a sanish way of softforking it in).
* 2) Other parts of the lightning code (in particular, watching bitcoin transactions) become significantly simpler if malleability is  ignored.
* 3) It's the right thing for Bitcoin; all smart contract systems want this.
This result is NOP for lightning in the short term; assuming SW is the same as pretending malleability doesn't exist.  But if we need to add malleability support later, it's going to be painful, since handling it correctly in all the places it's missing will be hard.

Right now exchanges and their compliance to draconian 'anti-money-laundering' rules ruins the anonymity of bitcoin. Those with access to the databases of all of the major exchanges have the ability to match too many bitcoins to too many identities (mine included).

Bitcoin was designed to replace the fractional reserve banking system. Why would you think it is limited to cash? Bitcoin is the foundation of an entirely separate banking system. One in which banks need to have money in order to lend it and politicians can't manipulate it to bail out their buddies.
