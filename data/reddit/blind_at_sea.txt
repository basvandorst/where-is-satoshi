It doesn’t need to be a currency to hold value... the currency aspect has nothing to do with its growth or volatility. If people intended to use it as a currency, they wouldn’t be trading it.

Sorry, misread. Argument still stands. One mans final mistakes doesn’t stand for all. He started to panic trad because of his original losses.

Gdax. The answer is always gdax. You can still add a bank there

Excuse the stupid question but what is considered a direct deposit? Just any deposit made? I use my BOA just to pay my personal bills so it's always under a $1500 balance. Just toss in my bill money every month and send it off instantly. Will I be in the charged category? If so, I'd just switch banks

Cryptocurrency might not legally be defined as currency yet but that is its intended purpose. Theoretically you could do this but why? Why would someone pay $5 to play a game where the prize is $0.10 in a tradable asset? Why wouldn't they just buy the crypto themselves? This makes absolutely no sense on a business standpoint. You're limiting your customer base to people who want to win crypto... your niche gets rid of all the children who have their eyes on the big stuffed bear. aka, your profit makers. This would eventually work in casinos but as for an arcade, no. Stop. Take a shower and think about what you've done.

Gdax will raise your withdraw limit. If you had that much, they match it. Just have to do a bit more verification.

I wouldn't say it adds stability. Maybe security and predictability. I don't think futures have anything to do with the recent low volatility. It's time has just passed. Pretty curious to know how many around here have actually dabbled in the futures market.

I hate the whole argument against day trading. The man turned 3 btc into 300btc in a year. He lost 200. If he held the 3 btc from the start, he'd still have 3btc. Instead, he has 100. Trading is the way to go and holding is for the untrained. Crypto is unpredicable and sometimes you lose some but the current volatility is a day traders dream.

That's what I figured but I was hoping to be wrong. Guess I'm moving banks over $12... can't let them take my balls.

Way more than $250 usually just cash at an atm. Don’t think that’s considered a direct deposit

This happened to me. Can't remember exactly how I recovered but it's something to do with your google account. I think you can set up a recovery mode or something

Honestly curious to know how bitcoins energy numbers compare with the printing and transportation of paper currency,,, seems like the comparison is never brought up.

Yea go ahead and use gdax. Coinbase takes their price from them it's just not a live price like gdax. Same company.

The majority of bitcoin is held outside of exchanges on personal wallets. Just so you get an idea, coinbase only holds about 100,000 btc total. Exchanges can easily be hacked and there is no insurance. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 03:00:49
Yes. Literally every single exchange does this. That’s what makes them exchanges.

My 85% gain in 15 days is shit? Maybe just maybe you bought wrong. I don't think moving coins will help your bad trades

You only need an attorney if you want to fight it. You just need a tax advisor to tell you how much you owe and pay it before the time period.

Because you arnt awarded anything... account a gets charged the fee. Cycling money between account a and b an infinite amount of times would leave you with approximately $0 profit. If account a sends 1 btc to account b, account b only receives 0.99btc

I’m not an expert but from what I understand is you have 21 days to file for the owed taxes. If you don’t they will look into it themselves and most likely add all their fines and such. Best to ask an expert. Gotta be a tax advise sub around here somewhere

Bitcoin is one of many. In the real world we have gold but we go our day to day trading with paper money. There are many many other coins out there. Many that focus on the technology and its long term potential. Bitcoin will always just be a tradable asset such as gold because of its volatility. If the real world ever widely adapted crypto, it wouldn’t be bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 03:09:56
Why would they need to buy btc in order to accept it as a payment method?
@_date: 2018-02-28 07:41:06
But he's simply wrong. The reason there's no 3% discount for using cash is because there isn't actually a "3% hidden fee". Fact is, credit card transactions are a business EXPENSE. It's why a lot of business don't accept them for certain transactions whether that's high, low, or just any in general. A crypto currency only world with no volatile prices wouldn't have a 3% discount on items...l that's just nonsense. In fact, current crypto transaction fees are higher than most bank fees.

Sell at 11 rebuy at 10-10.5. The big round numbers are always hurdles. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 08:26:19
No because the price continues to rise. Volatility is the only thing that hurts users.

It wasn't necessarily supposed to be linked with stamps or collectibles in general. I was claiming that there is nothing stopping anyone from printing their own currency. Yea, you're right. Some stocks do pay dividends. But this is exactly why stock value doesn't have much to do with a companies actual value. Dividends are paid off of the companies actual profits. The stock price itself is separate and value is up to the shareholders to decide. They're all just tradable assets.

I can print out 100 stickers right now and sell them each for a dollar. Each are now worth a dollar. Those people can then go on and sell them for however much they'd like. It's the same as any private or public corporate stock. It's valued simply at what people think it's worth. Tesla currently has a market cap higher than Ford yet they've never turned a profit. How is this possible? Stocks work the same way as crypto. They have no direct correlation to anything. Yes, news will cause a rise and a demise but in the end it's simply up to how much the people ask for it. There is absolutely no reason anyone can't start their own crypto or even easier, make their own paper currency out of stickers. The reason crypto itself is so highly valued is its technology, wide acceptance, and its ease of use. Before paper money was introduced we used ores and valuables because of their rarity. The rarity and difficulty to obtain the material is what gave them value. When paper money was finally introduced we still backed the currency with things such as the gold reserve. When we got rid of the gold reserve we caused a steady rate of inflation. There is no limit to how much currency can be printed, there is no rarity, thus it loses value. Crypto has limits. Those limits cause appreciation and eventually security.

You bought a rabbit for $10. 
Rabbits are worth $5 now
You lost $5.
Option A:
You trade the rabbit for 2 chickens
You're still negative $5
Option B:
You buy another rabbit for $5 
You trade for 2 chickens
You're still negative $5. 
The only difference is you have now doubled your assets. I don't understand what you're not getting 
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:10:18
It could also go right back up to 20 tomorrow. Are we forgetting that it went 19 - 10 - back to 19? This crash is bringing volume up. Bitcoin will be volatile again for the next few days. Might go lower, might go higher. Buying some now to get a spot but prepared for lower. Will probably hover between 6-12k. Easy gains for traders
@_date: 2018-02-15 09:39:58
Neither is better nor worse. It depends on whether or not you want to put more into crypto. If it was at $10 and is now at $5, regardless you're now at a loss. Whether you accept that loss or don't, it's there. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:36:24
11k is a hell of a deal when I sell at 20 again

What industry would this benefit? What lead comes through any of these general messenger services? Every industry has their own crm systems specified for their needs with their own built in messenger services for this exact purpose. This separate tool does nothing those don’t already do. 
I just want to know what industry this benefits. I’ve just actually never heard of leads coming in through any of these 3rd party services. They get directly routed to my CRM software. What industry currently receives their leads on Facebook/WhatsApp/etc? Who does this help? 
How many free trials have been created? What’s your turnover rate? How many current active paid users? What makes you worth that evaluation? I can create this with what you’re asking for a 10% stake so I assume you’re making a profit, how much? Why sell equity when you can take a loan? Why do you need the capital?

You should cover your loss if and when possible but it has nothing to do with exchanging for chickens. The loss isn't permanent when you exchange for chickens because the value of chickens can rise. The loss or gain is only permanent once you step away from crypto forever. Buying another rabbit will just add to your overall portfolio. You can cut the rabbit in half and exchange for just 1 chicken instead of buying a whole new rabbit.

(Price you paid x quality) + (price you paid x quantity)/ total quantity
1 ltc purchase at $230
2 ltc purchase at $220
(230x1)+(220x2)/3= 223
