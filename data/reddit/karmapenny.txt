To be honest though I could get behind an apple unlimited. The direction Apple has been going lately with their Mac books and iPhones is infuriating

The email they sent to everyone actually said they would support Bitcoin cash withdrawal  "by January 1st" which I take to mean before or no later than. That's only like 12 days away so this isn't too shocking. They went on to say that the addition of full trading support would be decided on at a later date. Little surprised they started with full trading support but honestly it's so little work on their part after adding withdrawal support that it's not that shocking.

I'm holding you to that.

It's worse than you think :(

I think fees are increasing because transactions are being created at a higher rate than they are being processed. Thus if you want your transaction to process in a reasonable amount of time you have to set the fee higher than the fees of pending transactions.

The difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks because hash power is constantly changing. If hash power increases then the difficulty needs to increase as well to keep the block rate at 1 every 10 minutes. If hash power decreases then the difficulty needs to decrease to keep the block rate at 1 every 10 minutes.
Adjusting too slowly runs the risk of a large hash power drop killing the chain. Essentially a big miner with a lot of hash power could drop out and leave the remaining miners to have to mine thousands of blocks at an extreme difficulty. It would simply take them forever to reach the next difficulty adjustment  and so transactions would just pile up and everything would get super clogged and potentially cease to be usable.
Adjusting more quickly allows miners to game your system. Essentially they could mine hard when the difficulty is low and then once the difficulty jumps up they leave to mine another chain knowing that the remaining miners will eventually mine enough blocks to kick in a new much lower difficulty. At this point they jump back in and mine it all up super fast. This causes crazy fluctuations in confirmation times. So you would have some times where you get confirmed instantly and others where you have to wait hours.

No one knows. The current DAA is getting gamed to shit. The purpose of the DAA change is to reduce this gaming. A couple of simulations were run that seem to indicate the new DAA will be effective. If the new DAA proves to be less susceptible to gaming then the expected outcome is that the hash power will split to a ratio that is similar to the price ratio as that would give miners the highest profit.
[You can read more about the new DAA and it's testing here](

I built my own private android app just to monitor my portfolio. This disorder is real!

I mean that may be exactly what happened

Would the rest of the world measure in dollars or Euros though?

That will stifle the flow of incoming money as fees keep climbing. And new money is what drives the price up.
Or maybe it won't I guess the top 1% does hold the majority of wealth.

If I were them I'd start buying a ton of bitcoin so that when they announce they will start accepting Bitcoin they can sell after the price jump

I'd say about 3.50

I suppose it could constitute insider trading since they'd be making trades based on knowledge that is not public but I'm not sure if Bitcoin would count since it isn't stock. Someone more knowledgeable care to chime in?

I realize reposts really bug some people out for some reason but I'm just trying to learn.
I found that particular link and most of my searching not very satisfying. I guess I'm trying to determine if there is a benefit to smaller block size or is the debate purely just team A wants control vs team B wants control.

Yea oddly enough it seems like countries in the middle of political or economic turmoil may actually be the first true adopters some day
