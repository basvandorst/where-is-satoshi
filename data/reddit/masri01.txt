Who knows
@_date: 2019-07-25 13:19:29
Has bitcoin became a pump and dump coin? geez
@_date: 2019-07-01 12:38:10


not the movement we want!
@_date: 2019-07-02 11:51:12
Such manipulated actions lol.
@_date: 2019-07-02 18:06:17
I shorted at 11476 so I’m still up.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:20:06
Great time to buy actually. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 13:31:24
The dumbest people are the people that hold onto there coins. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 13:45:00
Yeah because I can really manipulate that. If me saying shit like that can change the price of the market, then seriously take out whatever is left in this manipulated market, because it’s a joke!
@_date: 2018-08-04 17:33:41
All of crypto is way over valued. Crypto is just a pump and dump market. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 13:06:25
This is it. Resistance broken. Better sell all my alts to bitcoin now. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 05:16:58
Never try to predict the market with bitcoin. Because it will leave you behind if you try to time the buy/sell. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 23:01:11
Not if you shorted at 8k.
It will be silly to short around 6k because guaranteed you will get rekt. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:55:23
Can you please send some my way. I'll be happy with just 1.
@_date: 2018-06-29 22:59:15
Lol how happy everyone is now, when everyone was depressed at that same price it is now 2 weeks ago. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 08:20:18
Coz 1=btc could be worth nothing. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 08:52:09
If it dips under 6k sell 25% under 5.5k sell 50% and if it goes under 5k exit all markets. Trust me...
@_date: 2019-08-07 13:57:31
We got to make sure the Chinese don’t dump it in 9hrs time!
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:28:38
It’s not going to go to zero man
@_date: 2018-06-29 22:39:18
Fake pump
@_date: 2019-08-06 10:50:02
Don’t sell boys. Hard sharp dips like that, can also mean sharp spikes.
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:09:50
Can it just bottom out and get it over and done with. If it bottomed out in February than right now we would have 20k bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-24 11:57:09
It’s still worth 5900 man....
@_date: 2018-06-22 22:21:46
What you guys seeing is a bubble popping. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 22:42:21
Yeah you guys know what I mean. It’s a small pump to get people in tether to buy back because of fomo then they get screwed lol. It’s happened to me over time lol. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 08:12:34
This is what you call a bubble guys.
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:21:25
I just want to pay off my mortgage and be debt free from these banks! Bitcoin is the only way for me!
@_date: 2019-02-19 09:56:57
ETF getting approved. Save this message. 
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:07:53
I sold  25% at 8k usd and have been waiting for a pullback ever since.. so yeah... lol
@_date: 2017-09-14 09:58:05
Buy your bitcoin from BTCmarkets. Transfer it to coinspot you will end up with more money. Then you trade them to the Alts you want. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 14:19:59
Yep, I'm over this crap from China. Just ban crypto and exchanges once and for all so we can move forward without the hiccups. They're not the only country in the world that exist. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 03:38:05
I just dropped 3k in 5min. But I ain't scared like how the governments are of bitcoin. If we hodl together than bitcoin won't drop. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:10:53
No I mean $3000
@_date: 2017-09-20 09:53:29
Pissoff you dickhead
@_date: 2018-07-11 10:35:08
Will you sell if it hits 5k? Because that’s where we going to...
@_date: 2018-07-10 11:43:10
Nobody can predict Shit! 
@_date: 2018-04-01 13:45:27
Bitcoin won’t rise back until it has atleast 50% of the market dominance. We are nearly there. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 14:40:04
When 5k?
