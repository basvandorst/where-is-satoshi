Its not only logical. That's a stretch man. There is some positive criticism by buttcoiners, some of it is logical, but most of it is antagonizing. The same goes for bitcoiners too. In each group there are also extreme outliers. 
Lets be real though, there are "paid shills". They are not paid in the conspiratorial sense that bitcoin outliers believe, instead these are mostly working age men who are wasting time on reddit while being paid to do a real job. They are in a sense stealing from their employer. In all honesty the truth is even more pathetic, even if it is less exciting than bankster shills.

It is most definitely a show of confidence and support or lack of confidence and support. Either way it's part of bitcoin for better or worse in fruition or not. No amount of bitching from you will change that. 
I am on your side, I agree that it is no where near the full potential of bitcoin. The blockchain could itself, revolutionize ETFs as a whole. Hopefully one day we will see the open ledger used for transparency.

@_date: 2014-10-29 15:02:45
Partially true. The protocol functions the same. If the price was that low then mining would be very cheap. And the opposite if it was that high. Also if it was that low it simply could not function the way it does now. You could not move as much money with bitcoin.

It couldn't be any more bullish. He understands what bitcoin is a it's core. He understands Satoshi wanted to take away economic  control and power from the godverments. Just because he is skeptical it will happen, doesn't mean that quote isn't bullish as fuck.

What the fuck would the core devs do about the price? 
@_date: 2014-09-23 22:53:40
Exactly. How could these business owners not put it together. These are smart people who need to focus on the bottom line all the time. PayPal must realize that and have a plan in place. If it is not no fees it must be some other incentive to keep business owners even after they have educated themselves about bitcoin fees.

@_date: 2014-10-29 15:26:25
*Tinfoil hat engaged*
The US government or possibly a multinational group financed the rise of last year by buying an absurd and doing it in a way which made the price rise and rise. They have unlimited buying power so the price didnt matter. After they had enough coins they stopped pumping the market. The market tried to explain this by creating "willy bot". 
You might be asking yourself, why? Why not accumulate the coins in a way that doesnt pump up the price? Because the price exploding was the equivalent of hundreds of individual crypto early adopters getting funded. Companies started sprouting up both good and bad. 
Now the group is dumping coins. Constant market sells have plagued the price over the last months. Once again the market has tried to explain this moronic way to exit *any* market by calling it the "bearwhale". 
The companies and individuals who had capital now have little to no capital. Their reserves are dwindling dramatically. What follows this massive price decline? New government regulations that will cost these very same companies more money. The same companies that have undoubtedly lost some of their reserves from this drop.

You know what I was just thinking. Say bitcoin "takes off" soon... That stack of bitcoins will continue to grow and grow in value... For example if bitcoin ever reaches $7,500 the gox stash will be worth the total market value of bitcoin right now $6 billion. Kinda scary.

Yes because I only accept gifts over a certain dollar amount. 
@_date: 2014-08-31 17:23:51
Right so they would be distributed evenly on top of all existing bitcoin and future. Because they would be increasing by factors of 10 or 100 or 1000 it wouldn't matter because we would increase the amount of atomic units in a bitcoin at the same rate. Its not inflationary because there are still only 21 million "bitcoins"  and one "satoshi" is still 100,000,000th of a "bitcoin".

Check out [coinmap]( looks like there's almost 100 retail locations accepting bitcoin in your state. I have heard of that not being very up to date so I guess, beware? It's easy to find a way to spend them online, overstock, Newegg, Tiger Direct and more. You may find [The big list of bitcoin](tblob.org) useful, and if you want videos I suggest [World Bitcoin Network](  specifically the 101 series.

 I don't know man, but if the buttcoin guys goal was to trash BFL (which is odd because that was the goal of for the better part of this year) why would he sell the site at all? You seem to think I have a problem with him making money? I definitely do not. I just think the whole story is amazing.

To everyone then, is there any difference between having a hard fork address a single issue and having a hard fork address many issues? 
I could see a hard fork being a public spectacle at this point. Plan it several months in advance to prepare the masses and work in as many changes or fixes in one go.

I guess I already understood that it was inaccurate technically. In my opinion it is catchy enough to be inaccurate. In a way the statement is truish, "the bitcoin network is faster than a supercomputer **but a super computer can do things and the bitcoin network is a decentralised network that only secures the blockchain.**" 
The bolded part is needed for full disclosure, but without it the first part does not become false it just lacks clarification or context. Truish. 
Either way if bitcoin clicks for just one person after reading the super computer line, isnt it worth it? Hell anyone worth having in bitcoin would quickly figure out that asics secure the blockchain and they wont function like a super computer. It also provides *some* context to the size of the network as well!

Okay I now understand it would be adding atomic units. Not dividing Satoshi. Thank you for that. 
That was not my question. Say we take the code and change the total amount of atomic units 2,099,999,997,690,000 to 2,099,999,997,690,000,000. We also change what a "bitcoin" represents from 100,000,000 to 100,000,000,000 atomic units. Now there will still be the same amount of bitcoins 21,000,000. The atomic units will continue to represent fractions of a bitcoin as they do now, just more spaces to the right. There is no new wealth being created. Just an evolving code. 
Explain to me why that would matter to anyone? Miners? Users? Traders? I don't get it.

Until then I think we need to get in the publics conscious a lot more than we are now.

In my opinion, volatility will lessen as more B2B happens. Bitcoin being a national currency would most definitely bring in loads more B2B. So the move could solve the volatility issue itself. Of course there still lies the why, and I am certain I do not know why a county would do it. I also do not know enough to say there would be no reason, or better that there never can be a reason for a country to adopt bitcoin as a national currency.

5 years from this date bitcoin will be worth ~.1 penny per bit.

I have a question about atomic units. I had a discussion with agentzero last night but he seemed to give up on me, what better place to turn to than moronic Monday! 
As I understand it, one bitcoin is made up of 100 million atomic units. There will only ever be 2,099,999,997,690,000 atomic units. Thus hard capping a "bitcoin" at 21 million but also hard capping the decimal place at only 8 places to the right. 
My question is, if in the future it became apparent or important that we needed more decimal places to the right, could the code be adjusted? 
We change it to say there will be 2,099,999,997,690,000,000,000 atomic units **AND** a "bitcoin" is now 100 trillion atomic units. This would add 6 more spaces to the right of the decimal in a "bitcoin". It wouldn't change the economics of bitcoin, would it? It seems to me the newly introduced atomic units would just continue to be represented as decimals. 1 Satoshi, or .00000001 bitcoin would still be 1 out of 100,000,000 out of 21,000,000.

I would say it has to go far below 430 and stay there for at least 48 hours. I am not saying I don't think this is possible. But look at stamps chart,  we went below 430 for awhile but then jumped back up. Now we are back below so the 48 hour counter restarts. At least that's how I interpret the bet.

By the time there are 21 million bitcoin there will be more than 7 billion people. Also hundreds of thousands if not not millions of bitcoin will be lost and or forgotten. 3000 bits is a little on the high end ;) let's not forget too it would be 3000.00 bits, because .00300000 is what 3k bits looks like and we would probably use Satoshi like cents. 
All in all, I think there could be a stock split of kinds if the price ever rose too much or the number of users. If we made it divisible to even another 4 or 6 places to the right it would create a lot of room to grow.

Price fluctuations dont really matter for you, the merchant. There are services like BitPay that take on the risk of volatility for you by converting whatever percentage you want immediately into USD. So you accept btc through bitpay, i buy a $20 phone case from you with my .035 BTC, BitPay processes it and gives you $20. Say your profit is $10 bucks. You could ask that bitpay gives you $18 and .007 bitcoin. Or whatever.

Strange analogy mate! You could tip three people 1 dollar or 6 people 50 cents now. You could gamble the 3 dollars on your favorite sports team or on a hand of blackjack. You could use circle or coinbase to cash out into fiat. You could spend it at overstock, newegg etc. Humble indie bundle? You could just hold it and watch the price fluctuate because thw price is derived from a crazy market. You cant smoke it and you can't become physically dependent on it though, sorry.

Hey dude you know how you can't play poker online anymore, bitcoin makes that possible. 
Hey dude you like playing slots, check out Satoshi dice. 
Hey dude you like drugs or Cuban cigars, yeah places like OpenBazaar will make acquiring the things you want possible and safe. 
Hey dude you want to prove the existence of a document, bitcoin. 
Hey dude you want to play with a crazy volatile market, bitcoin. 
Hey dude you hate your bank? Bitcoin could replace aspects of modern banking or at the very least force them to compete which is good for you. 
Hey dude you want to store your own wealth bitcoin could end up being a viable store of value. It is right now, it's just volatile.

Yes totally agree on the TED talk. Andreas is a captivating public speaker. Maybe you could collaborate on the material with him. 
I have some follow up questions but feel free to answer others first. 
Do you believe Satoshi is an individual or a group? Is there anything you regret not saying to Satoshi before he vanished? How do you think "he" would feel about the state of bitcoin today? Sorry, but your personal relationship with Satoshi is too fascinating. 
Finally, are you a gamer yourself? Do you think there are any cool applications for bitcoin inside a video game? If so what? 
@_date: 2014-11-11 14:03:25
I agree i checked his profile. But the way he tips 1 satoshi makes me believe he is acting ignorant but understands fully what he is doing. Either way I'm undecided on how i feel about these kind of tips. On one hand they are spammy but on the other hand if a content creator got 100,000 of them it wouldnt be so bad. Or if a newspaper got one for each page read. Or whatever.

That is right! There will actually be 2,099,999,997,690,000 or just over 2 quadrillion atomic units or "satoshi" when all 21 million bitcoins have been mined. If somehow that is not enough, the code could be adjusted to say that a bitcoin is equal to 100,000,000,000,000 or 100 trillion atomic units and the total atomic units will be 2,099,999,997,690,000,000,000. This will avoid changing the economics because there will still only be 21 million "bitcoins" but it will also create 6 more spaces to the right of a satoshi.

You dont know me. If you think the US godverment is going to regulate a p2p protocol out of existence you are the greater fool.
People like you honestly think bitcoin will be destroyed by regulations. How can they regulate it? Individually arrest all the node owners? The miners? More will pop up. Thats how p2p works. The godverment has no control. I suspect some of the more progressive countries will eventually actively protect the blockchain in the near future.

There is definitely a cap, and no more will be mined or minted after 21 million bitcoin. No single developer main or not would have the power to change that number.
1 "bitcoin" is actually 100 million atomic units as far as the code is concerned. so each bitcoin is a one followed by 8 zeros, 1.00000000. This allows you to use fractions of bitcoins, very small fractions. For example .00000100 is called a "bit". There are 1 million bits in every 1 bitcoin.  So right now there are ~13 trillion "bits" and that still the last two spaces to the right to represent a kind of bit cent to the bit dollar.

The blockchain replacing traditional trade vehicles is many many decades away if it is going to happen at all. In my opinion, I wouldn't even put a time line on it and definitely not 5 years.

Now imagine a buttcoin enthusiast(?) how many will look back and regret their time involved in the *community*? I have to say the vast majority will look back and say WTF was I thinking?

This dude gives away gold a lot. Last time I checked his stats he had funded like 10 days of reddit server time. It's clear he is calling out Vitalik Buterin of Ethereum. For what purpose? We don't know. He also claims to be the bear whale and says he dumped at 300 to pay taxes.

I was actually hoping you could verify the technical side of this equation. As I understand it, Multisig is a BIP as well (?) but you can have a 3 separate keys of which you need at least 2 of them to send coins. I dont know if it is possible for these addresses to use bip0038, I thought maybe you would know. I guess that is essential for your business model.

If feeding me is mining and apples are asics then apple trees are super computers. If all I need to do is eat, then a constant supply of apples is perfect. Sure a tree could also give me apples, but it does all this other stuff too so it doesn't feed me as well as unlimited apples.

I understand, I can't help but be *anti*-theist. It's not at all common in the outside world or even here on reddit, but for me it is real. The truth is I think that religion, that way of thinking is holding us back. 
I know one day humans will be fully aware of our existence. When that day comes we will be alone for the first time in our existence. It will also be the first time we realize that we have never been alone. We are here together, all of us, on this tiny fucking rock. 
When you think about it, it is truly amazing. All of the beautiful scriptures, the morals, the stories, all of the ideologies over all of the millenia were created by us, not Gods, humans. There is no heaven, no hell, no one to judge you but yourself. 
I believe the next step in human evolution is understanding we are alone. That the only thing we depend on is us, the only guidance we have comes from us, and the only way we can be saved is if we are good to each other. Anyways you don't want to hear this shit. I'm sorry man.

Does this recent change make that different? When I tried before on masterxchange it wanted my source mastercoin address or something.

Other than aesthetics how is it any different to the miners and how is it any different to users? We know how it is different to the code. It just means that there are now 100,000,000,000,000,000 atomic units in 1 bitcoin .03 is still .03 and .00000001 a Satoshi is still 100,000,000th of a bitcoin.

Doc.. I... Here's the truth.. We're just bored. 
I spend a lot of time on the internet, and is a constant source of entertainment. 
Every time it starts to get boring some bitcoin business fucking explodes spectacularly and everyone collectively either flips out or goes full libtard. It's hilarious to watch and participate in. 
The past week or so I was kind of getting bored of but then all those darknet markets got taken down and shit hit the fan again. 
All the libtard nutcases came out of the woodwork 'Ruling by force, taxation is theft, leave silk road alllooonnneee' etc and it reminded me why I still visit this place. 
You're all fucking loonies. It's like going to the zoo. 
is like the tour guide to the zoo. Pointing out all the different animals and what they can do. 
'And here's a throwaway that someone on made to pretend they're an excited now user to keep the greater fools convinced..'
'Oh, and this is an ancap nutter who believes that capatilism is too nice as is. He's hoping Bitcoin is going to usher in a new paradigm of super selfishness. Watch as he types his vitriol about taxes, the government and regulations despite being only 16 years old'
'Here's a guy who maxed out all his credit cards because he thinks Bitcoin is going to make him a millionaire without him actually doing anything of value.'
'And here's the suicide hotline.'
Ya'll fuckers are hilarious. I'd probably still visit if I had to pay money. The shill cheques I get in the post from JP Morgan and Citi Group are just the icing on the cake.

I do not think he blames me, I felt some guilt anyways though. Not because of his personal financial decisions, but because it's obvious the price was causing him unnecessary stress. In the same text thread where he told me he sold I can scroll up and see myself saying "Do not think I'm telling you, you will get rich." I was really fascinated by the tech at the time and that's really all I pushed on him. That I see a lot of future applications for digital currencies in general.

Bitcoin makes up almost 90% of my current USD value and I don't expect that to change very much. Call me crazy but I see value in having many blockchains and devs and passionate users. At the very worst it's like hedging a bet. What I'm trying to say is do what you want, wait for Doge to dip and buy back just like 10k... Or check out reddcoin, in my opinion a more polished and focused alt coin.

I don't understand how it matters whether I have .03000000 bitcoin or .0300000000000000 bitcoin. I mean that in an economic sense and a technical sense.
Edit: I don't mean I don't understand that 100,000,000 *Satoshi* = 1 bitcoin I fully understand that. I under stand we would be changing that. It would now be 10 trillion *Satoshi* = 1 bitcoin.

I would use Coinbase or Circle. I kind of feel like if you don't want to use Coinbase, Circle would also be no good for you considering how similar they are to one another. That leaves you with proper exchanges or Local Bitcoins/Mycelium. If thats the route you want to go, I believe it could be done safely. See if anyone is willing to set up a meeting at your local bank, that's a lot of money and maybe both parties would feel safer.

If the pattern continues the next high will be somewhere above $1000 and then it will retrace to around $1000 as the new "bottom".  It makes sense to me in the adoption phase that this would happen. Who knows if it the pattern will continue, for sure not me.

I have a question that may be technical as much as it is economical. Would you ever consider doing multi sig paper wallets. Can those exist? I think it would be so cool to have 3 (or 6, two of each) paper wallets which act as 2 of 3 multisig. I would even like one or two of them to be bip38 if thats possible.  Have you thought about this as a possible revenue stream?

Changetip is doing more for bitcoin than you will ever dream of doing. I agree the service is whack and the business model may be unsustainable without data mining.

Thanks for the source, but it only confirms my comment. First off the data only goes back to October where as a year ago would be September 4th. We can't see the stats for this post we are referencing because it happened **July 2nd 2013**. The earliest we can see is **October 2013**. And the numbers are 
**564,565** unique and **4,405,407** page views in October '13
The most recent complete monthly numbers we have are from **August 2014**
**684,082**	unique and **6,039,908** page views in August '14
How exactly is that less than October 2013 which by the way is not July 2013.

It could get easier. But either way people been losing shit, throwing shit away, getting scammed for as long as humans have bartered and used currency. Its not going anywhere.

@_date: 2015-01-04 16:27:19
Ill try an get this all right. Bitcoin is not "divisible to 8 places",it is but it isnt. 1 bitcoin is actually made up of 100 million atomic units, commonly refered to as satoshi that are not divisible. In essence making 1 bitcoin divisible up to 1^8. When all the bitcoin are mined there will be  2.1 quadrillion atomic units (satoshi). Say even half are lost, there will still be 1 quadrillion atomic units. 
Beyond those incomprehensibly large numbers is the possibility of a change in the protocol. For example there could be a change to the amount of atomic units (satoshi) in 1 bitcoin, make it 100 quadrillion and also change the total amount of atomic units ever mined from 2.1 quadrillion to 2.1 sextillion. Then 1 bitcoin would not have an altered value as there would still be 21 million mined but now 1 bitcoin would be divisible to 1^12, 12 decimal places.

Guy has been bashing bitcoin since 2 dollars in 2011. I mean fuck. I can't imagine the feeling, he is in wayyyy to deep now. I mean in some regards his whole persona is tied to bitcoin failing. I imagine his life is like the upside down of a typical bitcoiner. Hoping adoption fails, the price falls, government bans it, etc.

The idea is still relevant. People need to experience it for themselves. Its not about receiving one tip for 3 cents. Its about seeing the possibility of bitcoin.

What?? I think spending hours online "making fun" of people is the sign of a mental disorder. I don't think it's unique to buttcoin it's just more rampant there then bitcoin. I guess mainly because that is their goal, to make fun of other humans for doing human things. 
When do I claim superiority? All I am saying is I won't regret this time spent. A buttcoiner will. Spending hours a day making fun of people on the internet does not make you a "comic". When you are grown up and have a partner in life go ahead and tell them you spent many hours a day making fun of bitcoiners online, see how they react. 
Sorry for being genuinely concerned about humans who I interact with on a daily basis.

Had a friend text me today saying he was selling all his bitcoin. I told him about it after the bubble last year when the price was ~700. I did *not* tell him to invest but I did give him the hype speech about the amount XBT has increased in value over the years. He used coinbase and made weekly $25 buys I bet his cost was at like $450 a coin... I didn't think he was checking the price and worrying, felt kind of bad that it was causing him enough stress that he sold. I personally have lost more money than him but will ride it into the dirt. Or at the very least put it on &lt;10 at some point ;)

It's so interesting to watch all of this unfold. I think a lot of us may be jaded being in this moment. For perspective I try to imagine Satoshi being a single human and watching all of this silently. You have to imagine he is fucking happy. Do you think he ever expected it to get this far?

Blockchain isnt exactly an online wallet. You control the keys. So you could do that for ease of use. I think youd be safe sending it to Coinbase or circle as long as you use 2fa and some good passwords!

Whether butters want to believe it or not, right now there is a small growing group of people who are having their first investment experience in bitcoin and alt coins. Maybe things like Havelock. They are moving their bitcoin around easily, quickly and with no barriers. They can invest a tiny amount or a large amount. These people will eventually venture into the traditional investment vehicles available digitally and they will be shocked at the inefficiency and expense of trading with things like eTrade. Not to mention how long it will take, lack of transparency.

There are many differing accounts. The main alternative theory suggests that the death camps were actually labor camps (marginally better). The gas chambers were actually delousing chambers to contain lice from spreading in the camps. That Hitler and the Nazis weren't as obsessed with genocide and they didnt kill as many jews as reported, closer to 300k rather than 6 million. 
The thing is all of this is very controversial! What I was pointing out though is that in some European countries its illegal to question the official story, the one you heard in your US education.

Problem with moon. Someone could have bought at 270 a week ago. They could have bought 100 for $27,000 and gone long full margin 20x. Meaning every time the price moves 1 dollar they make 100X20X1=$2000. So on a $40 price swing they made $80,000. Now Imagine when you start getting into bigger movement. A jump to say 370 with our ballsy 100 btc on margin dude is $200,000 profit, from his original investment of $27,000.

The issue is no matter what you are, you are still that guy acting like you are so much smarter than everyone else. Not only that but you prefer to spend your time around people who do not share your opinion *just* to disagree or rub people's noses in shit. It comes off as desperate, a little less so than some of your more fanatic buttcoin buds. I am not religious, the last place in the world I want to spend my time is arguing with religious people.

It looks like the fake person being punished was real and the hit was real.  A corrupt federal agent acting on his own had access to ~~an~~ **a** Silk Road admin account**.** ~~because~~ They had pinched the Silk Road admin and he turned over the credentials.  The federal agent used those credentials to steal bitcoin from the Silk Road.  Ross Ulbricht, thinking that the Silk Road admin had stolen the coins hired a hitman to kill the Silk Road admin.  ~~Accept~~ **Except** that he hired the corrupt federal agent to kill the Silk Road admin they picked up and he faked the hit and got even more money out of Ulbricht.  The Silk Road admin was innocent of stealing the money and he is a real person. (he is now in legal trouble anyways) The fact that Ross Ulbricht hired someone to kill him is also real.(allegedly)

Not at all. Doesn't make it feel less condescending. You can be right and wrong at the same time. Not everything is so black and white. 
Bitcoin is an experiment. The white paper being a kind of hypothesis. 
There is nothing more destructive to an experiment than perceived conclusions. 
Moon kids and buttcoiners fall in that space. You perceive a conclusion to the experiment. 
Buttcoiners conclusion is that the experiment has failed and nothing can be done to fix it. Fair enough, but completely useless to the rest of us still participating in the experiment. 
Moon kids conclusion is that bitcoin is perfect and will inevitably become very valuable. Fair enough, and not as useless as buttcoiners because they contribute to the experiment, however little that may be. 
I enjoy your opinion and dont care if you stay or go. I just dont see the point to your endless nightmare. Oh trust me I know you and borderpatrol tell yourselves its fun but cmon. Climbing a mountain is fun, being with friends is fun, hell going to work can be fun. What you are doing is not fun.

Lol I love your note bro. Good for you. What do you do with 100 bits.... Thats a good question. I guess I would send them to an address of which only I know the private key. I would then spend said bits in addition to other bits that I had sent to aforementioned address. I would spend them on a good or service. How you can compare collecting digital change to hoarding is beyond me. If you want to send me one bit, cool. If you want to send me one early block reward, cooler. Do i pick up other people's recycling? What the fuck does that mean? No... But I do pick up change, even pennies. If someone handed me 10 cents id put it in my pocket, I wouldn't think twice. I wouldn't be like what the fuck dude 10 dollars or nothing. Its even easier with bits, a few clicks and its sitting in an address accumulating.

@_date: 2015-04-14 18:25:53
Soo there was a ~1 day period where you could buy bitcoin for 160-180. Since then we have had maybe 12 days where you could sell as low as 220. The other 110 days it traded above 220. Now as it finally touches 220 again you sell? You are still selling low looking at the timeframe between your January buy. Really low. But hey, you do you man.

I think people who are getting scammed are being dumb. The whole point of local bitcoins is to meet in person. Meet at the library or Starbucks. Call your bank and ask if you can conduct a financial transaction in their building. How can you get scammed in person? I guess if you are selling you would have to watch out for counterfeit dollars. If you are buying its so simple just wait for a confirmation or 2 and give the guy his money.

I agree what they did with the whole donation was a Bob Loblaw law bomb for suresies. I just don't really care, no one was forced to give them their bitcoin. Just like no one is forced to donate to counterparty. what set me off in this thread is this idea of a divide between bitcoin and any other coin. Its useless, its wasted energy. Bitcoin and Ethereum and reddcoin any fucking coin they are all good. Even if they arent good, what does it matter? No amount of dick swinging is going to make it stop. I just like to think of bitcoin as the dad to a new idea. This idea is going to be experimented on by humans probably for a long while. Why not support all our children? Why not embrace them, root for their success, it feels good to be positive.

2 years ago I walked into my local public library. I sat down at a shit computer and printed out 5 paper wallets from bitaddress.org. Since then I have stored bitcoin on coinbase, btc-e, bitfinex, okcoin, circle and of course the paper wallets. I have never used 2FA, I have re used the same password for all my accounts and email. I have never lost 1 satoshi due to "hackers". Not on any online account, not off my mycelium app, not from my paper wallets.

I honestly have no idea what you are trying to say. All I have said is they raised a fuck load of bitcoin and then spent the better part of a year spending those bitcoin on developing ethereum. I have no idea why these negative posts keep popping up in I think its over extended bitcoiners fearing they are even more fucked when ethereum launches. Its actually hilarious and even though I didn't participate in the crowd sale, I find myself rooting for Ethereum.

In my opinion the halving gets factored in long before the actual date its halves. People often complain like why didnt Satoshi make the reward drop more evenly distributed over time? I think the answer is simple, he knew that the market would correct over time in anticipation of the event.

Who? Mt Gox? Best I could find they trademarked bitcoin in Europe, only after some crazy lawyer filed trademark applications in europe asia and us. They spent money and beat the lawyer in Europe, he then pulled his other applications. Mt Gox has never enforced their trademark and I really doubt they ever will, but even if they do it will have to be in Europe.

How are you coming to this number of 44,000 bitcoins? Seems ludicrous. There were roughly 20,000 listings on Evo, even at 2 bitcoins per listing we are short.

I don't have the required prerequisite knowledge to really answer that, at all. I assumed there would be some kind of information that a node handles that a proxy does not. Some way of proving it is a good node. I can handle being wrong about the current state of the network/tech, but I can't handle your opinion that it can never be solved. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 20:39:52
@_date: 2015-03-18 18:48:53
Yeah, I agree with you for the most part. Those tough talkin' nerdz got that coke from someone though. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 23:46:34
Its based on my opinion, like I said in that comment! At 130k and roughly 20k listings they averaged 6.5 bitcoin per listing over the last what 2 days? How long were withdrawals not happening, not very long. I dont know the full logistics of this site, but I just cant imagine them being able to grab 130k from vendors and buyers in the amount of time it would take for said vendors and buyers to get wise that something was up. So yeah, in my opinion, the math makes no sense to me for 130k or 44k which is the number last night. I think even 10k is pushing it. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 15:08:20
I get that, but how can it be solved for miners and verifying transactions but not for nodes or listening sockets? 
Also if the amount of unique active nodes is so low, is there anyway to manually confirm ownership of a node that positively contributes to the network? 
Let me explain it this way, with a hard fork is it possible to use the mining network to help verify the nodes and then use some kind voluntary incentive. Ie the donors are users and the pot is split between good nodes?
@_date: 2015-03-17 18:44:02

Some people will never understand that bitcoin is **all about the drugs**. Well not really but its digital cash. Just like I can take 50 bucks from you in exchange for a bag of weed. Then turn around and buy some nice bed sheets with that same exact $50 dollar bill, you can buy weed in one transaction and bed sheets in the next with bitcoin (well, that's the idea anyways).
Hahaha the downvotes! Jesus christ It doesnt matter how much you downvote me your investment is still shit and all your friends are still laughing at you.

Never having any debt isn't necessarily *good* in the eyes of the powers that be. I was being short, but there is no other explanation. I bought bitcoin on coinbase at 170 a couple weeks ago, i have sold on coinbase at 800. It is what it is.
