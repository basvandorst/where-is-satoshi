Smart man. Any fool who drops 250k on a set of wheels is way overpaying for pussy.

Is there a general consensus on whether it's recommended to move funds from old paper wallets to the newer wallets? It seems most of the concerns in the wiki are fairly easy to protect against. The most concerning one is the javascript vulnerability which I obviously don't understand. Is this only an issue if the wallet is generated on a computer that is reconnected to the internet at some point? Or is there some inherent vulnerability with how the codes are generated? 
Thank you!

I think they're buying 10,ooo BTC / week, not $10,000 dollars worth of BTC.

Why are paper wallets obsolete? If I stored bitcoin in cold storage on paper wallets in the past they all need to updated to new wallets?

Is there a law of diminishing returns for increased fungibility? Would there be a point at which they turn negative?

"Balancing the budget" is wink/wink washington code-speak for gut programs to the poor and give even more to MIC. He didn't fail.

Yeah, I understand that it all still adds up to a bitcoin. I think I'm just having a hard time wrapping my mind around the idea that something can be both infinitely broken down into smaller units while still maintaining the same utility as before (the size of the unit is irrelevant). And if that end purpose is maintained, regardless of the diminution, is it really scarce? To follow your cake analogy, suppose you had a cake that could be continually divided and able to satisfy the needs of everyone who wanted some. Cake would cease to be special, as it's no longer scarce, though of course it's value would be infinite as it's utility is conserved regardless of the drawdown in material. I'm not sure the cake is the best analogy. I'll try to think of another.
Maybe the problem I'm having is with the 21 million number. It's completely arbitrary. You could make it one bitcoin and it wouldn't change anything would it? Or it could be 100 billion bitcoin. From an inflationary standpoint, it only matters that the supply doesn't increase over time. It's assumed scarcity is based only on the 21 million number. And it seems like there's a fallacy wrapped up in there that I can't really understand or explain.

Not to be a dick, but what's up with the map? Cool site otherwise!

The ratio is based on total float, not how many people have them. 1 bitcoin = 21 million club. 21 btc = 1 million. etc. You're in much more rarified air than you think, I don't think there's 100,000 people holding 21+ coins.

Few people were "actually" waiting for $1,700, most people are full of shit. The problem is that the psychology completely changes on price drops. If it hit $1700 those same people would have been clamoring in the message boards for sub-$1000 still without the stones to buy. I was one of them telling myself I would've gone all in at $1500, b/c I woulda been able to get in the 1 million club. Would I have gone all in? I don't know. That's why it's better to invest what you can afford to lose. If it moons, you're good...if it goes zero, you're ok.

This is the weird similarity between the old guard and the new guard: they both have this bizarre hatred of gold. I'm with you, why would you not hold both? The commercial doesn't even make sense. A 5% portfolio allocation of gold can be stored in a tiny safe at home for 98% of people.

$3,400 was as insanely unrealistic in November as $1700 was in January. Nobody knows the short moves, much less the long.
