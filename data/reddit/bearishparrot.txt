Not chicken, it's always a good idea to diversify your portfolio.

Oh nice. I just finished *The Complete Sailor* by David Seidman. Next up is *Get Real, Get Gone*. Any recommendations?

McAfee also has Guatemalans poop on his face through holes cut in hammocks, so take that at 'face value'

Nice, just got Essentials of Seamanship yesterday actually. I'll check out those other authors as well. And I appreciate the offer, but I'm holding on to my BTC for now :-)

If they got Capone they can get you, too.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:15:19
Except these guys aren't going to be buying bitcoin, they are going to be betting on it.

I'm not gonna play around with the IRS. If they got Capone they can get me. I'd rather pay a small percent now vs worry about asset seizure and jail time.

We pretty much already have that, it's called capital gains tax. Bitcoin is taxed as a capital asset right now when you realize profits, not as a currency. 
The government looks at Bitcoin gains as if you made money selling a house or piece of art.

They are out in force lately. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:07:45
Yeah, just not today haha

Oh man, if only I got into bitcoins during even the late 1800's. Fresh off the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad, I should have just bought some BTC instead of trying to stake a claim in the newly purchased land Jefferson bought out west.

Why is this making me laugh so hard
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:29:57
This is a great response.


While I don't want to, I'm leaning towards agreeing with you. However, I think BTC will hold it's value for at least the next few years. As new coins are being developed, they are usually matched with either BTC or ETH for exchange. Buyers have to convert fiat to either BTC or ETH, and then use that in purchasing their new coins/tokens. I believe this tie gives BTC an almost 'gold standard' equivocation, and will help support the price going forward.

Nice, got mine a few weeks ago and am loving it. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:43:45
I mean, the pictures of everyone on the start up team is white, it was a joke. Some people just love being offended I guess.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:10:36
No. You switch your coins to gdax (same company), and TX from there. No TX fee out of Gdax.

I started with only 300 Lamborghinis in my Lamborghini account. Knawledge.

An extra 6 seconds, because I have to reach over and plug it into my computer.
But seriously, it's the same amount of time as any other wallet, physical or digital. The transfer speed depends on your miner fee and the current network traffic. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:45:59
Just let it go, some people just love to be offended. Especially white people.

Works fine on mobile, just use their site, it's mobile friendly

These are certainly risks, but I feel like this sort of legislation would take time to write and cram through. Even then it would need some sort of controlling body, which takes time and resources to assemble. It's a risk we could see coming and prepare for most likely.

This will raise awareness for BTC and crypto in general. When more Wall Street types view Bitcoin as 'legitimate' because you can trade futures for it, it will bring in more money as investments by default.

I was actually looking for something like this earlier, thank you.

I have a Trezor and they have been pretty on the ball with the recent forks. Click a couple things and it creates a new wallet with your new shitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:39:46
It depends how you play it. I bought in when China said they were banning crypto, and BTC dropped a bit. Sold 3 days later as the price stabilized and increased my investment by almost 20%. Seems like a good return to me.

Alts diving hard with the current BTC rally, now is the perfect time to get into alts.

Actually, blockchain and smart contracts are being used for that already. Ripio (formerly BitPagos) has been doing P2P lending in Latin American countries for the last few years, since most of the population remains unbanked. It's already happening.

Looks like it was supposed to go live in September, can't really find much else on it though
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:19:36
So you bought 'BT1', which is basically the 1MB coins we have now for 2600?! Basically just betting on the chain that will be most successful?
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:59:16
It will go down, the only question is this: if it's 5500 now, will the next dip be from 7000 to 6000? 6000 to 4000? 10000 to 9500? The FOMO is real either way.
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:07:38
Good luck with your site! I just put one of my designs on Amazon merch, and am working on a couple more.
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:17:20
Sure they do! In ten years 1 bitcoin will net you $131.32! Lock in those sweet gains now!
But seriously, it's like they went: 
"Should we use Metcalfe's Law to determine the BTC price in 10 years?... Nah, fuck it let's just count up from 2."
@_date: 2017-10-20 07:26:30


Yeah, as soon as I started investing in bitcoin I really wanted a full coin. I just think it's cool to be in the 1 in 21 million club :)

If your paper was backed by a known source that people believed would pay that debt while also being able to be used throughout the country and held at a stable level countering inflation, then yes, I would take it.
