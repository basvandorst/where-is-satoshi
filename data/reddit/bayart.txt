It's beyond me why anyone would want that.

As long as you have a bank account with international bank transfer you can get it everywhere. Some sites allow specifically for SEPA (like bittylicious), which works with most EU banks.

It's something Paypal *constantly* does. If you do *anything* that's mildly outside the boundaries of their behaviour and pattern-recognition algorithms you'll be harassed constantly until you verify everything.

Hey America, please stop saying "the world" when you're referring to yourselves. Thanks.

Their fraud protection concerning BTC is probably US-only as well.

Paypal has been a prime target for fraudsters for 15 years, so there's something to it. But they've managed to piss me so much over the years that, even if I've got perfect credentials with them by now, I just avoid them as much as I can.
They have quiet a few horror stories on their account.

They don't. Any power held by any European institution only exists as far as it is delegated by a treaty. Upholding treaties is up to individual nations.
