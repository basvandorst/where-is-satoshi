If you need to ask, **I would recommend against trading with margin**. Read up a little more and trade spot before you decide to use leverage.
If you're not profitable trading spot, you will definitely  not be profitable trading with margin. The more leverage you use, the more risk you take on. So, if the market moves significantly against your position or opposite of what you're betting on, you will be force liquidated and lose all of your money.

Trading is cut-throat. Misinformation and ambiguity are tools of the trade. That being said, I will admit there is no single method out there that will guarantee you a successful play everytime, to my knowledge. 
I've only been trading for almost a year now and I am well overall net positive. When I first got into trading, I held the same beliefs as you did. Over time, I learned it wasn't as simple as looking at TA indicators and performing a trade. 
edit: a word
@_date: 2015-04-10 14:30:06
TA is more an art than it is a science. I don't believe that the traders that TA actually works for will come out and tell everyone how they make their money. If they did, your argument of a consensus method self-imploding would hold true. Let's also not forget there are many, many variables at play in the market. It all boils down to how well a trader can effectively evaluate the current market, given TA and other variables, and make the correct play

How exactly do you identify which trades belong to which trader and how do you deduce his decision making process from those trades? If those things were possible, which I'm not completely sure they are, I would agree with your points.
Feel free to downvote me. I'm not claiming to be an expert trader. If anything, I am but a humble novice. I welcome all new knowledge

**Buy/Sell Bitcoins --&gt; Payment Method**
*Credit Card Agreement*
Credit cards are a backup payment method only and cannot be used to buy bitcoin directly.
An additional fee of 3.1% + $0.18 will be applied to any charges made to your cards.
An additional "cash advance"/ATM fee may be applied by your bank, depending on your agreement with them.

Did you enter an address in the pay out box prior to locking it? If so, you'll receive your payout to that address. That's how you control your coins.

Once a payout address is locked, it may never be changed again. You may have locked the address by accident. You may have clicked through the lock confirmation prompt without realizing. You surely must have entered a wallet address before into the box haven't you? If so, the coins will be sent once you have reached the payment threshold. You cannot request a manual withdraw.
@_date: 2013-09-15 04:35:56
Sure. One moment as I pull out my *time machine*.
@_date: 2013-10-01 02:29:30
What browser were/are you using? I say this because, chrome likes to keep a history tied to your gmail account if you logged in to the browser before.
Also, the wallet identifier string is a security measure... They can't just give it out. There's a reason why they don't let you just register through conventional username/pass. It makes it slightly more difficult for a hacker who has compromised other accounts that belong to you using a common username/pass.

@_date: 2013-11-27 19:18:29
Oh, I understand. 
If you had reached the payment threshold it's possible that Slush's pool would have sent the coins to the original address that was first put into the payout box when you first started mining. The original address is the only way you'll be able to take control of your bitcoins.
2 years ago, you likely installed Bitcoin-qt on to your computer. You need to search through the HDD's for a "wallet.dat" file. That there holds your private keys. 
Try a search for files with a ".dat" extension if no luck.
Just send me replies through PMs. Tell me if you find it.
