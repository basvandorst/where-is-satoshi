Thanks for the heads up. I was kind of thinking this too &amp; am prepared for this possibility.

Bought this before I had a mobile phone. It was right before smartphones became an absolute must. Or maybe just as they were....

No. Is it possible I didn't choose one? Can my bitcoin be 'free floating' as it were? I remember having a discussion with the guy who helped me make the purchase re: wallets... but I don't recall 'choosing' one.

It has to be connected to an email account then?

Here's what I remember-- I was in a foreign country. Met a nice guy who took me to a bitcoin meeting. I had been interested in bitcoin for a while so it wasn't just like a pickup thing. Went back to the same place where the meeting was a few days later by myself. There was a "bitcoin atm" there or something like that... I wanted to take the plunge. Another friendly gent was there and walked me through the process of buying some bitcoin via the machine. I have all kinds of codes and numbers written down from this day, but I have no idea what an "exchange" is or a wallet. Never touched my "account" whatever form it is in since.
Yes, dumb. Yes, regret. Please help if you can. Thanks.
