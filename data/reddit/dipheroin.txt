Can you counter any of that?

I know exactly how much more advanced military technology is. That doesn't mean you can just say that since the military has superior technology that any fantasy I think of is reality.

Do you really believe that? We can't even cure the common cold, I hate this idea that were going to be immortal in a century it's just not going to happen.

Uber isn't a new technology. Electricity and automobiles both took something and made it both easier to use and more efficient. Bitcoin does none of that. In fact it does the exact opposite. If I want to buy something with money I simply walk into the store and give them my money. If I want to buy something with bitcoin I have to make an account somewhere, wait a week for my bitcoin, try to figure out the right place to send my bitcoin, pay a fee to send them somewhere, wait up to hours for my coins to be sent to the block, etc it's just so inefficient. It's fun to pretend we'd be traveling the stars because honestly it sounds amazing I love space, but if we're realistic we see that not only is it silly to say we'd be traveling space by that time but who knows if we'll ever travel the stars.

1. Netflix will never get to stream live sports because ESPN and Fox and all the other TV stations that show sports would never lose out on that money. You're suggesting netflix might implement a pay per view type system, but there's nothing they could really offer that would be worth paying extra. Won't happen with new movies because the cable companies already do that and Hollywood studios don't like netflix they'll never give them the license. 
2. Two huge companies already do this. Google with YouTube and Apple with iTunes. You can rent movies to watch for $3-10 and they already have the system set up and the user base there's no reason netflix would change their system that works to try and compete for that market. 
3. People buy DVDs and Blu-ray because they want to own the movies. Some do it because they like holding it in their hand, other like doing it because if they don't have access to Internet they can still watch it. Blu-ray is also better quality then most streaming sites. 
4. That competitor already exists and it's called Hulu.

Can you not tell time in a Rolex? I didn't think I would need to explain the function that a watch serves. It's not yours or mines business on why someone would spend so much on a watch, but it does have a purpose. And I never said it was easy or that I had the know how to steal wallets. What I do know is what I've read on this sub about people who take every reasonable percation and they still are hacked.

That's not a great answer. Basically the only way you can get these cheap bastarda to ever spend bitcoin is if there's a discount. It's pathetic. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 21:03:35
No the difference is that those things have purposes. A website to tell people I have exactly this amount of money and that's it's only purpose is ridiculous. And the fact that it's so easy to steal people's wallet just adds to that ridiculousness. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 19:22:11
Kidnap no, but the fact this gets up voted shows how just not in the real world you guys live. Come on, you're suggesting to give hackers and thieves a data base that tells them exactly who to rob. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 23:40:34
Don't you guys have a huge problem with hackers? That's a great idea tell hackers exactly who's worth stealing from... 
@_date: 2015-04-18 22:00:47
No the difference is bitcoiners will not spend money at all unless there's a discount.
@_date: 2015-04-13 02:01:54
Lol you're going to just get your bank account flagged if you cash out 5k bitcoin into it at once. 
@_date: 2015-03-29 04:44:12
This guy has no idea what he's talking about of course Europe has customs agents. 
@_date: 2015-03-12 18:18:15
Are you only able to see extremes? Seriously dude who delusional are you? I'm not saying don't try and improve bitcoin transaction times, I'm saying you're not going to be getting 1k more transactions than credit cards per second in a year so there's no reason to try and implement a system that complex when you most likely don't even get 50 transactions/second 
@_date: 2015-03-11 21:41:03
That's not how things work. It's pointless and almost counter productive to have a system that can process more then you need when bitcoin is still such a niche market. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 01:48:48
Ok I feel like you think you're some sort of genius but you're actually really stupid because you cannot comprehend what I'm saying. I've tried to explain it to you twice and the point is going over your head so I'm just going to leave it be. But I can answer your first question and it's simple. Look at bitcoin so far. It's not getting any more successful lol. 
@_date: 2015-03-11 23:39:15
Because I doubt bitcoin gets even near like 50 transactions per second. Look if bitcoin ever seen takes off then sure 3k transaction/second is something to look into but how about we wait until some more websites even start implementating it. 
@_date: 2015-03-11 18:29:15
Because that's really going to happen in a year when basically no big websites use bitcoin.
