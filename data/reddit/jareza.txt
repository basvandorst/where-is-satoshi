Thanks everyone for your comments... IT is now dealing with these issues because we do have daily backups... thing is, they were also encrypted... Right now I'm using localbitcoin to close the deal and Im trying to send the money using moneygram or westernunion but both of them have denied sending the money because of security reasons, as of now Im leaving to a moneygram counter... I know that these scumbags might not unlock my files, but its a risk the company its willing to take since lots of critical files are at risk
Again thanks, this community really helps and everyone should be proud of it, I have never EVER bought a bitcoin in my life, now I know how they work and how to buy them... 
Thanks again and will let everyone know I we ever decrypt our files

Conclusion: Paid these damn terrorists: Got an .exe file and now my files are being restored... they are a bunch of BAsTHERDS, but at least they have a moral compass...
The way this works is that the software will restore and then it will delete itself, leaving no trace of it. Im guessing this is to avoid reverse engineering.. anyway, thanks a lot for the support guys.
Now I know more about bitcoins and now the IT department will take the correct steps to avoid these situations in the near future.
Best Regards!

yes it was a friggin word file... one of our users opened the file without knowing and from there it infected the users computer, our server and of course, our backups....

just one question comes to mind: The "locky" screen is asking me to create a bitcoin wallet...  and then buy bitcoins on any bitcoin marketplace...
Im using localbitcoins but I see I already have a wallet in my localbitcoins account... is it really necessary to create another wallet?
here is the snapshot of the decrypt page
