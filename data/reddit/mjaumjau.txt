A man got to have a code.

They can just create money when they want to, a bitcoin bank cannot create bitcoins out of thin air.

Completely this, it will be interesting to see bitcoins being lent to entrepreneurs to boost economic growth, since that's the only way to pay the interest on depositers bitcoins but I don't think we're at that stage yet.

Incredibly impressed with what you guys are achieving. 
No questions from me, just a word of thanks and please continue! I'll be sure to spread the word.

Man, I fucking hate this. I read that GAO report in February of this year and was posting it to and nobody gave a single fuck or paid any attention to it, even some random journalist stole, incorrectly, parts of my reddit post for his own news site. And now, 6 months later "beforeitsnews.com" is claiming this crazy new audit is shocking the world over. 
Rolling my eyes so hard here. This is a hyperbolic title with nothing behind it but what was already in the public record; that banks will gleefully jizz money into each others accounts and do everything possible to keep as much control as they can over the economy.

May I ask how you would do this?
@_date: 2012-12-23 16:30:23
They have the same value that fiat banknotes have. They are a store of value, supported and given value by the people the use them, in the case of fiat banknotes this is governments and their people and in bitcoins case, internet users. They work simply as a store of value to be used in exchanges like how gold used to work until banknotes were invented. Marx referred to this as a commodity having "exchange value" but no "use value" you can't eat them or wear them or whatever.
Basically it should be us asking you the question, why do you think that normal banknotes and money have value but you think bitcoins don't.

The problem with BitCoins - I can't get ino them and fly to the moon. They are therefore worthless.
@_date: 2011-04-06 01:59:56
yeah, i'd love to hear more of these, keep it up!
@_date: 2011-04-18 11:58:54
i suppose if the bitcoin was lent out within a terms of service that legally required them to pay back goods of equivalent value you wouldn't have a problem. i'm really not sure what the legal framework would be here, i suggest somebody consult a lawyer who deals specifically with loans/debt. if it gets really bad you could always sell the debt to a debt collection agency to pester the person (whos details/verified address you saved from earlier) provided that the agency is willing.
i dont think bitcoin loans are impossible, just very difficult given its current infancy.

Thanks to the hack, I now get around 3 emails a day from nigerian 419 scammers. 
I don't mind though; they're hilarious.
@_date: 2011-02-22 05:39:00
presumably the new currency would be aggresively marketed and achieve a much wider user base than bitcoin currently has.

Why the hell didn't I buy Bitcoin when it was going for less than a dollar?

Paper notes and coins will be lost until they are no longer suitable as a currency.


Yes, and BitCoin can be transferred in smaller and smaller divisions (8 decimal places) to combat the deflation too. 


You're welcome.

lold at no
also a huge number of people have some variation of "money". interesting.

To Wright: *"We can make your tax problems go away if you claim ownership."*
To Gavin: *"Tell them CW is Satoshi or your career is over."*
Seems a fairly easy play. I actually think this might be the one.

This is brilliant, but my qualms are that in such a society, voting and elections will be largely unnecessary since a big role of government (to allocate resources and funds) will have been usurped by the crowd funding model, leaving government as almost a formality.
And secondly, hopefully the WikiHouse empire will have collided with the 3d printing empire by then to bring people instant rent free housing!

1. Stop doing this crazy shit you fucking nutbag, what were you expecting? EVERYBODY tells you how unsafe this is and that you should expect to lose everything.
2. Read Ben Graham's book about value investing if you really want advice on maximizing returns.
3. Don't put any more of your money into it at this point for the sake of your sister's future and the legacy of your father.

What the fuck is up with mainstream journalism? Why do they write in this strange jarring way, it's like they have their own language that they feel they have to conform to. Sorry, this has nothing to do with Bitcoin I just wanted to tangent rant.

That thing about inflation going to people first and causing imbalance is called the Cantillon effect. 
That's all I wanted to say, I generally agree with you.

It's competition, the US gains its economic strength from the fact that it controls the world's reserve currency. It bitcoin usurps this, US loses power, it would only be natural for them to fight it. 
Luckily, however I tend to think that the people in control the US finance's actually don't care about American hegemony at all, only about lining their pockets, and would probably sooner adopt bitcoin for their own ends rather than backing a sinking ship.
