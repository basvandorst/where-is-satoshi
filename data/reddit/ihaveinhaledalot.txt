This is amazing. I remember Intrade added "trading" of 100s of major stocks. Before they were shutdown. But it was absolutely massive. This is even better. Add index trading.. qqq, DJIA, SPX. And VIX.

Right about what? 
@_date: 2016-03-08 06:27:14
I understand pegging. Cp has fluid pegging for both token and asset. Whereas rootstock has not revealed (read: THEY DON'T KNOW) the ratio or how it will work. Go read for yourself. Or simply answer my question with "i don't know" which you have. You are insisting a none answer is an answer. Rootstock has a token and it's ratio and it's pegging mechanism has not been determined only speculated. It's vapor.
@_date: 2016-03-07 03:18:42
Elaborate please. Explain how it is technically not a "sidechain". CounterParty was a more pure and smarter ACTUAL implementation. But i digress. Please elaborate on the main technical differences between rootstock and CP and how those differences make rootstock superior.

I'm not spreading FUD. I'm simply pointing out that a clandenstine shill campaign is less effective than flooding the network. It's cheaper as well. Bitcoin is what it is.
@_date: 2016-03-08 01:50:19
So a 1:1 peg is what makes a sidechain? It has it's own token, assets that are not pegged 1:1, requires seperate processing of asset chain data.. tell me what is the advantage over CounterParty? Rootstock will issue it's token without a burn. It will invent value out of thin air. It's worse than CP. An altchain through and through pretending to be a BIP or something.

@_date: 2016-03-10 06:10:51
Go read how the tokens are proposed to be generated. Once it makes sense how the people in control of their generation make money then you will understand that functionally rootstock's value proposition is the same as CounterParty. Only CP is a more pure implementation in the context of value discovery of transaction cost. Anyway, maybe we should revisit this when rootstock actually has it figured out and launches something? I have trouble excepting explanations without all the details. Peace!

It's not insane in the context of bitcoin. Look at bitcoin's price and the bubbles. Lightening striking twice.

Yeah it's great for bitcoin when someone disables it. The longer the transaction times the better. What a retarded community. I bought my first coin in 2012.. i fought r/buttcoin.. you are wrong.

@_date: 2016-03-09 05:22:49
Cp is pegged to bitcoin. It's value was entirely derived from ACTUAL bitcoins.  It has no value outside of the context of bitcoin. No more than rootstock tokens will (if ever created). Your semantic argument is based on misunderstanding borrowed from rootstock's own misunderstanding. Rootstock doesn't exist.  I asked you what the difference is based on what is it's proposed functionality. Specifically i was trying to determine if you knew something I didn't. It's not a hard 1 to 1 peg. If so no token would be needed. You think only 21 million rootstock tokens will exist? And value of the assets they might represent are limited by bitcoin's total value? 
@_date: 2016-03-05 14:33:11
What better way to spread FUD and panic than to effectively attack it? Why try and make up and manage fear when you can just demonstrate an actual (scary) issue?
@_date: 2016-03-09 19:19:24
Yes it is pegged. In a more intelligent and functional way. But it's a dead project now too. Just like bitcoin.

How can they resist things like naked shorting? They can throw up walls that don't exist and push trades around with zero resistance. They'll never lose.. how could they not be solvent? Haha they have their own money machine.

The problem is you don't have any idea  what CounterParty is so your explanation of the difference between  it and rootstock is so innaccurate it's wrong. Do you understand that XCP were generated on the bitcoin blockchain by permanantly burning bitcoin thereby converting btc into a fixed and permanant number of xcp? On the blockchain. On the bitcoin blockchain. The concept of sidechain people are jerking on is an inferior design right out of the gate. CounterParty is as much like litecoin as bitcoin is to ethereum. But again people are so full of hopium and confusion for this vaporware they don't care to be informed. Rootstock is a token far removed from actual value in comparison to xcp. But you wouldn't understand that unless you went back and took an open look at how the fixed number of xcp were generated. But i care less than you because rootstock is vaporware.

You seem sure. So what is the permanant peg then? 
@_date: 2016-03-07 03:20:42
And how is the sidechain connected to the main chain? OP_RETURN? 
@_date: 2016-03-12 07:12:40
Ofcourse it can. You can write a contract to do this. That's the point. Keep reading and watch the rootstock mirage disappear.
@_date: 2016-03-07 03:24:20
Learn the history of CounterParty and then blow your own mind. Rootstock has no future because it is literally another CP which this same community killed because it's demented.

"Right, so that leads back to my original question. Will Bitcoin, the protocol and the development community, have the adaptability to implement ethereum's strengths?
No, absolutely not. This community is so aversive to change its ridiculous. There is no way to even trim SatoshiDice bets taking up 80% of top10 address Txns without a witch-hunt being started. And that's in bitcoin's best interest.
Bitcoin is MySpace. Facebook will come. Bitcoin can't adapt and that'll be its undoing."

Why? They've been actively calling for a world-wide deflationary digital currency for decades. If you go back in this sub there are threads talking about it. They know a bit about money and banking.

As soon as we get close to the true natural conspiracy behind bitcoin everyone gets scared and turns the other way. Bitcoin is the product of the very core institution that most here believe is fighting it. Quite simply it's the product of the IMF/World Bank/DARPA. More accurately a product of the real power in control of those groups. If people would entertain that reality for more than a minute we might get closer to understanding what "Satoshi" is. There is no Satoshi person. The only people capable of coming up with bitcoin were those actively pursuing it. There are white hat participants no doubt. And there are dumb patsies like Craig. Bitcoin is incubating in the wild... but is completely guided and controlled by those who've always planned for a move from national currencies to a global, digital, deflationary currency. The masters of this planet do not collect and horde currencies. They create them and use them as a tool to manage their power and influence. Bitcoin is not a threat to them. It's their project. And by the time it truly goes live there will be nothing liberating about it. Every bit will be tracked and controlled and indisputably tied to one's true identity. Until the tech is there it will be a little toy peons race to develop under the pretense of liberation or personal wealth. That's how monumental disruptive projects like this get done. The problem with a global, digital currency is almost no one would ever agree to one issued by a centralized power. Do bitcoiners really believe that those on the planet with the largest spheres of influence haven't thought about that? How would you move the planet from centralized national bank printed currencies into a global digital currency? Watch what happens to all the various bitcoin barrons in the years to come. They will do anything to actualize their wealth and those that won't will be branded as crackpots and sent out to pasture. All the while the Satoshi fairytale will provide fuel to the development and rollout. Satoshi the genius, libertarian freedom fighter. Satoshi the pragmatic economic rationalist. Satoshi the crackpot, subversive hacker with a good idea made better by the establishment. Satoshi the fairytale to be framed in whatever way needed to propel development and rollout of the one world digital currency.
@_date: 2016-05-07 11:19:34
In the case of who would be capable of creating a one world digital currency I'd have to go with whomever has the strongest desire and is the most capable. Satoshi isn't a person.
@_date: 2016-05-05 09:26:57
Ask yourself under what circumstances would someone in Gavin's position even SUGGEST someone was Satoshi without definitive proof? The whole thing makes no sense. 
@_date: 2016-05-05 09:03:59
Yeah because you and many other bitcoiners have turned him into something no human can possibly live up to. Also as a fairytale the guy never has enough influence to kill the dream. If it is ever definitively proven who Satoshi is that person Wil have the power to dive bomb btc's price. The idea and tech will live on but likely in a place with a real leader.
@_date: 2016-05-07 11:25:07

Why would anyone care about an NDA made under fraudulent pretenses? They wouldn't. What is all this NDA nonsense? NDA with Craig?  Hahaha
@_date: 2016-05-07 11:15:47
Just? Groups that do things outside of recognizable authority are often put together like that for the purpose of unaccountability. The World Bank/DARPA couldn't initiate the creation of a one world digital currency in the open with any level of success. The war machine uses mercenaries and contractors to carry out effective but often illegal objectives.
@_date: 2016-05-05 20:50:51
No one is pointing that out because it's not true.
@_date: 2016-05-07 11:04:06
Proof will be in the pudding with regards to "their" ability. In the future will their be a global, digital, psuedo-deflationary currency that is the progeny of bitcoin? A currency where every transaction is indisputably  (in their courts) tied to one's identity? I'd bet money on it if their was ANY WAY of ever actualizing the winnings given the context. Bitcoin is "their" lab in the wild. This is how you get a one world currency done.
@_date: 2016-05-07 11:22:48

Yeah for 1 second when it was launched and the hacker bought an etc from himself?
@_date: 2016-05-07 10:18:38
Here's an idea.. the people who actually inspired the creation of bitcoin continue to do so. Their intention of creating a world wide, digital, global deflationary currency remains the guiding force. They hold the keys. They manipulate and guide the development until the incubation is complete. Craig, Gavin are ultimately pawns, each with their own level of understanding with regards to the origin and the true purpose of bitcoin.
