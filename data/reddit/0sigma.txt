The world runs on incremental improvements.

That's over $700 million USD.

It’ll matter hugely for how much BTC you buy initially.

I watched [this]( video where he argues that a healthy bull market should pull back every so often and stair step up.  This feels "wrong", and could be a bear rally that eventually drops hard and fast.
I don't know what's going to happen, but I'm happy to see it show some life after a long nap.
Edit:  God dammit.

What dip?

Robotic asteroid mining.

Not necessarily. Just 1% of the world’s wealth (2.8T) transferred into available BTC (14.9M) would correlate to ~$188k. That’s just the wealthy diversifying their portfolios.

I keep seeing that advice.  Why don't you buy wallets on Amazon?

Grayscale's GBTC share price on 4/30 ~$6.55.
Grayscale's Bitcoin per share on 4/30 = 0.00098247 (from website).  This is $5.50/share @ $5,600/BTC.
That's a 20% premium over just owning and controlling the Bitcoin directly.  Plus the 2% management fee/year.

Would be cool to see an updated chart.
