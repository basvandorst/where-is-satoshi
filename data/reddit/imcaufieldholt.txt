It’s pretty awesome in the U.K.  far better than the US when you leave the resort. France and Germany are pretty nice too outside the resorts.

It really is waffle. He basically says:
“Bitcoin may go up or it may not, I don’t know. There is some good and bad news which could affect it either way, but don’t take any advice from me”. 
Waste of words.

Unless you are a trader who knows what they are doing. I would suggest dollar cost averaging if you want some bitcoin. But not financial advice ofcourse. Do your own research etc

This is a mixed bag of true and false statements with a sprinkle of confused conclusion.

If bitcoin is 10 years old and you say “ever since you were a tiny baby you have wanted to own 5 bitcoin”..... you must be about 11 or 12 (assuming babies are the 0-2 age range)...... something sounds strange here.

I can’t see how blockchain leads to...
“Communism is a political and economic system in which the major productive resources in a society—such as mines, factories, and farms—are owned by the public or the state, and wealth is divided among citizens equally or according to individual need.”
Blockchain is a ledger in its simplest form. It does not divide anything equally or according to need.

Women are generally more cautious. I think your comment should be “just imagine how many husbands did not tell their wives they invested their life savings in crypto”

Same old, same old....
All I can say is that for any of this to be true time is running out for the end of 2018.....

Soooo many things wrong, mainly it never gave any evidence. The video can be summed up as:
BTC is not going to crash because of technical analysis.
It did not show what the analysis was and we are just meant to believe the author. 
Nope just a shilling....no substance

Why do these videos never say anything? Just rehash history. In fact the title of the video basically is all you need to know. What a waste of time.

That doesn’t seem like a very good plan :-)
