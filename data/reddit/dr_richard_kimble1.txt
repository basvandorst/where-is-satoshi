No problem. If they take over another sub then you ban that one as well.
Eternal vigilance is required to deal with these types. If you don’t have that then they will win.

Because France is SECULAR. Do you understand that? That is one of the most BASIC principles of the French State for centuries now and Mrs. Le Pen wants another theocracy apparently. This is Europe not the Middle East. 
The people of France voted for Emmanuel Macron. 66% to be exact. 
Also I disagree that they all assimilate(Russians and others). Many of them are part of criminal networks and mafias. Is this assimilation? 
Many of the people you talk about deporting have no other citizenship besides French. Where are you going to deport them to? 
Again, assimilation is a process that takes time.

Any monetary is system is based on trust. This includes the gold standard which is by the way one of the absolute worst and most dangerous systems to have in place.

No one ever seems to bring it up. It is never discussed for some reason. 
Also define assimilation. Have all the French of Russian, Polish, Hungarian, descent who still retain their respective cultures while living in France assimilated?
Would you consider someone like Zinadine Zidene or Karim Benzema assimilated?

That’s actually the only prequisite of money.

Can we deport all the “whites” that don’t assimilate to French culture as well?
@_date: 2019-01-09 11:10:08
Yep. In fact almost all these so called populist movements and instruments are rooted in ethnic nationalism. 
Any time you see people railing against “the elite” or “globalists” or “bankers” it should be known that they are either willingly or unwillingly functioning as useful idiots for the radical right especially.

I literally never hear people talk about deporting French citizens of Russian or Polish back to their host countries.
Ok. So by your standards there are millions of Muslims(or people of Middle Eastern descent) that HAVE assimilated in France, correct?
I do not disagree with banning the burqa for several reasons so no I do not think it is racist. However it is a first step for many racist people who eventually want to rid France of all “non-whites”.
Please remember that assimilation takes time, sometimes years. Learning a new language, culture, traditions is not an immediate thing.
I believe there are valid reasons for deportation. Namely commitng crimes over and over again(especially serious ones), committing acts of terrorism, even being involved in terrorism, etc. 
But the issue of assimilation is tricky because people need time to assimilate, it is not an immediate process.
There are double standards being used here. For example, Mrs. Le Pen is for making Christianity the state religion of France. This is an open attack on the SECULAR nature of France, yet I never hear any condemnation of this from the right.

I actually disagree that Europe is to blame for “destroying” those countries. And even if it was it would still not justify a mass migration policy.
I do believe however that Europe(the whole of Europe) needs to carry this burden as punishment for not paying attention to the crisis in the Middle East sooner.
I remember in 2012 in Europe I would tak about Syria and every single person would have the same response. “What does it have to do with us”. Well now you know. Next time a crisis begins to spiral out or control Europe should prepare and make decisions early on.
The crisis only reached Europe when turkey, Jordan, and Lebanon could not longer take any more. For several years they were warning their capacity was waning. They took in about 4 million before they could take no more.

Usually what happens is that leftists form the backbone of public discontent and then they are easily co opted by radical right(this is what happened in Weimar Germany). The reason is once law and order breaks down all the right has to do is to use dirty tactics to appeal to tribal instincts or all people. 
Yellow vests are functioning as useful idiots for Le Pen and her gang of racists.

Yes it is. The arrival of migrants from the Middle East does not mean Europe has been islamicized. Islamization would mean that Islamic laws are being applied. Please show me one western country where this is the case. The only country I can even think of where Islamic law is applied in certain areas is Russia, which is not even part of the West.
You say “kick em out”. To where?
Most of them only have one citizenship, one passport.
