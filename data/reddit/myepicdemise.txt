But...but... decentralized means price cannot be manipulated!

Your advice will fall on deaf ears. People are so spoiled by the 1000% p.a. growth phenomenon of cryptocoins that they think stocks and real estate are worthless investments.

So for stocks, buy and hold. But if I'm an idiot who insists on daytrading, do it with forex?

Thanks for elaborating.


Actually the entity that can manipulate data is the broker because spot Forex is unregulated. But otherwise you're right.


This is believable. There are quantitative traders out there who use weather data for trading certain types of financial instruments.

He's also talking about the cost of renting that space and buying all that equipment. It would take quite a few months before there's any profit.

The problem is it seems like the average user is using Tor to fight government-level adversaries.

What would you say is an appropriate basis to use for trading then?

It's because of how people in this sub carry themselves basically. It's just full of memes and vehement objections against any forms of criticisms. If a noticeable number of Bitcoin fanatics are gonna behave like that, they're gonna attract another group of people who carry themselves in a similar manner, except they're against Bitcoin.
Edit: To add on, remember how one of the moderator of this sub started a thread to inform people to be cautious when investing in Bitcoin? A great number of users were flaming him in the comments instead of being rational with regards to his informative announcement. Negativity attracts more negativity basically.

Pray tell how you would define the difference between the two?

On what basis do these professional traders trade on if I may ask? More of fundamentals and quantitative methods I'm guessing?

Do you have any particular traders in mind? I would like to follow their blog.

I believe technical analysis actually worked in an era where financial markets didn't have such high volumes like now, where short term movements are basically noise (too random to predict). The basics of TA which are price action and support/resistance were probably used to predict market psychology, which actually makes some sense. But people took things too far and came up with magical sounding formulas like Bollinger Bands. For these nonsensical methods, I agree that they're likely to be self-fulfilling prophecies.
