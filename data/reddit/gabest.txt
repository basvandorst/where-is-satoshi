Why does it matter how much it is worth in USD? Bitcoin is a currency, you have to spend it on something in the end, it's not like everybody can cash out from a pyramid scheme. Most of you will end up with a new kind of money in your pockets, which you can only exchange for things like pizza. Does this pizza get cheaper in bitcoins over time? Probably not.

Hello guys, I am interested in being on the other side of a trade like this. How can I sell nothing to anyone?

Nice thing about Bitcoin is you don't have to wait until Monday to have someone tell you I-told-you-so.

Backed by expensive video cards with high resell value, isn't that obvious?

The cash you invested is permanently cemented in, unless it goes back to a very low level. The only way out for most people at this exchange rate is to spend it. There are two endings to this story, implode with many angry people or continue to live on as a currency.

Title is worded as if it was a good thing. Anyone who can live off his savings are not working. Inflation encourages people to continuously serve each other.

It is obviously not the interest of the shareholders to sell as much electricity as possible.

10% of 20 EUR is only 2 EUR. Every ATM charges you at least that much. Maybe it is still only 2 EUR if you send 2000. We don't have enough info...

Unrealized winners. Until they all try to cash out. That's what is happening now.

TV is a bad example, because it is a physical thing. If it was software, or a ticket to a theater, or something that is service-like, where the number of items sold does not increase your cost,then anything you can get is worth, dollars, bitcoins, their soul. The more the better.
