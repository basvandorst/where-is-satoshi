This sounds too good to be true. The minimum transaction amount is huge (0.5 BTC), and the company address given is actually the address of a company called TaxAssist Accountants Victoria. The website seems to have no track record at all. "arad01" is an 8 day old redditor with only one post. I'll pass.

Googling "bitcoin real estate" turns up some useful sites, like bitpremier.com (which has a real estate section) and bitcoin-realestate.com.

They'll have fun trying to analyse opaque blockchains like Monero's.

You can open an account on an exchange like Poloniex and then put some bitcoin in your lending wallet. The exchange will use your funds to help finance margin trades, but there is much better protection for lenders than on p2p lending sites like BTCJam and Loanbase. The loans also attract a negotiable interest rate.

There's a detailed discussion at their forum at discuss.nubits.com. They seem to be blaming the failure on mistakes made by the main stakeholders that resulted in a lack of liquidity. They don't think the recent surge in the BTC price should have caused the problem on its own. 
Their plan seems to be to keep NBT stable at a lower level, in the hope that after the BTC halving, or the launch of the decentralized B&amp;C exchange, it will be possible to restore the peg. This seems like a long shot at best in my view.

They might not have any choice about this, because they are an MSB, which forces them to follow FinCEN regulations. If the total amount you tried to withdraw in a day was more than some threshold ($2,000 or something) then that would probably cause problems in the absence of KYC verification. 
I would guess that ChangeTip doesn't really think that you are using them as a mixing service, but it might not help even if you can convince them of this.

If Coinbase filed a Suspicious Activity Report because of the transaction, they aren't even legally allowed to tell the client! More details here:

I also gave up on p2p lending after losing money. The problem is that lenders have no protection if borrowers default, and the arbitration services offered are useless in practice. 
I agree that these p2p sites aren't scams, but they encourage lenders to think that if they spread your funds among many loans, those are independent risks. This sounds true, until the BTC price spikes and everyone defaults at once. 
I'm sticking with altcoin trading, where I'm not at the mercy of another person.

Another red flag is that all the reviews sound like they were written by the same person. They're all about the same length, and all in English, but not in very good English.

I agree. This is why I never bothered with USD denominated loans. HODLing gives similar benefits, without any of the stress. I was trying to get more BTC, not to get more USD.

That's true: some of the defaulters wanted to be honest, and quite frequently they would promise to repay the loan eventually. Unfortunately, this rarely came to pass if they were more than about a day late.
