Wait you mean Bitcoin classic and Bitcoin Unlimited where just cons on the way to Bcash?

I’ll be very honest, I store my paper wallets in a safe deposit box; when the wallet is worth more then the house it’s stored in, I’m sure most would feel the same way.
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:51:16
Wow are you saying the guy who has 0 programming experience doesn’t know what he’s doing?
Next you will tell me BItcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited where just pump and dumps...
I bet after that your going to tell me that MT Gox was never solvent...
You can post graphs all day on lost purchasing power of $BCH vs $BTC and not convince these people. They fail to know the history of Bitcoin, and it will be there downfall.

Except Disney didn’t take a copy of another Disneyland change one thing, and call it Disneyland Cash...  Also Disney was an animator! He had creation skills.... Roger Ver has NO programming skills. At this point his biggest assets is owning bitcoin.com.

As someone who also keeps crypto in a safe deposit box, I have thought of this.. my crypto is in a fireproof/ waterproof bag with silica packets inside the safe deposit box.

Next your going to tell me he has failed to fork BTC twice before Bcash... but Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited definitely didn’t rip off investors.
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:03:04
You are misrepresenting forks; Satoshi wanted anyone to be able to build a better Bitcoin, and it COULD become the true bitcoin through consensus...forks are the decentralized model working as envisioned. When you sell that “free money” you are in reality hedging a market bet... you are betting on one coin or the other through your sell order, unless you are cashing out completely of all coins.

Legality has EVERYTHING to do with it... these are futures contracts 100% handled by CME under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. This really shows a total lack of understanding of how the market settles futures.

Isn’t coinbase releasing 6M BCH on Jan 1st... I’d say that’s a large concentration... 
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:19:32
Just wait for the great Jan 1st coinbase Bcash dump... that’s when they will get desperate.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:41:01
An 80% retrace right now would put us a little over 400% on the year...perspective helps on this one.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:56:35
We will just have this same debate with new idiots he cons to follow him. One thing I’m sure of is that Roger Ver knows how to part a fool and there money.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:13:38
No they had adjusted the API after I posted this the other day, so it was easy to see it coming... I cashed out my BTC, BCH, and BTG into coins I really believe in... There was to much drama.
I was more shocked that CB was going to dump on there customers. They had updated there page 4 days before, saying CB wouldn’t allow BCH for fiat. Then they launch early and without the promised email.
Then also suspended BCH trading, as there where strong signs of insider trading. This whole thing has made me switch to my Gemini account. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:36:29
Also Binance and Bittrex! We need to demand segwit with out wallets...

He has 0 programming skills, so he can’t say he created Bcash. Sounds like the best workaround his mind could cope with.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:25:58
BCH is in a slow bleed, I know some people that where caught in that flipping trap also.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:36:28
I don’t think it will be the death blow... but it will be the moment there community breaks and has to admit they are little more then a Altcoin... Bcash will slowly bleed until Ver moves onto his next con.
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:31:21
Holly shit I keep my crypto in a safe deposit box and have a fear of fire and flood... your idea is so simple and elegant! I’m going to have my private keys etched for future proofing.
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:40:55
Congratulations! We should make a bot to search reddit for people who called crypto a scam X months or years back, and link them to posts like this...
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:34:03
Coinbase has said that they will release the BCH, but not allow trading of it..
In fact, they just got the BCH withdraw wallet going and you can see in in there API if you sign in.
Now what’s going to happen when 6M+ BCH hit the exchange on the same day and you can’t sell them for fiat?.... expect a large dump with a rise in BTC / ETH/ Whatever when people get what is commonly referred to as “Free Money” ... Don’t believe BCH is bleeding to BTC; it’s down over 50% this month against BTC. 
Like it or not BTC is king of the hill right now... heck, I’d at least have faith in BCH if Robert Ver where to sell his BTC for BCH... but he hasn’t; and for good reason. His BTC has consistently made him more money compared to BCH since launch! If the guy running it won’t put his money where his mouth is, why would you? The best part is, with the launch of segwit on coinbase in 2018; combined with lightning network, and the 8nm mining chips going live in Japan next year... We should see a end to a lot of this bullshit, but I’m sure there will always be something new.

Now you can buy the dips in Cash app!

They would have to break the encryption on the wallets first. My first thought is of when banks seized gold also...
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:48:17
What your describing would be insider trading in to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission... If the trader doesn’t break the law on a normal day, what makes you so confident the fraud and insider trading will be so rampant in crypto? Regulation is bringing MORE eyes to our game, not less.
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:06:59
* If you understand exchanges go GDAX for fiat to crypto.
* If you are new and don’t mind paying more for simplicity go with the Coinbase app.
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:25:04
I agree... if all currency is a consensual delusion, then Bitcoin will have longest staying power thanks to the underlying community’s belief in it as a store of value.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:37:34
So what about Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited. what was his involvement in those?
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:22:40
They are great alternatives! Get the app and dump CB, Here are links for the lazy...

Great looking setup, I imagine the decibels get decently loud in that room.

Honest question: how do you maintain crypto as 1% of your overall wealth? 
My cryptoasset investments started quite modest, but as they have grown and been redistributed; I find crypto to now be coming up on my well funded 401k. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:15:47
I think tulips should be the official flower of crypto because if you type "tulip mania" into google news, all you will see is major outlets talking about cryptocurrencys.

Times like this is why lightning needs static qr codes sooner then later.
@_date: 2019-10-07 03:25:04
Hey, I love lightning and use it a couple times a week. I just also see uses for the static qr codes. I made my child a btc piggy bank, but currently tip him for chores with lightning. I would love an address where I could send his sats; rather then wait for him to find his ipad.

Though I agree that the “get rich quick” crowd is always worrying... I would say in THIS situation it’s BTC acting as intended. If BTC is truly a store of value, then this is what we want. I can see many issues with the people; but even with them not understanding the tech it is still working as intended (store of value) IMHO.
@_date: 2019-06-06 03:51:41
I thought Bitcoin would be a proper noun... Am I incorrect?
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:24:35
I spent over 1000+ BTC on a online roulette wheel... and that was just the first time I lost over a million in BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:02:22
I know the feeling, I was complaining about my wife’s $10/month Apple Music and she pointed out that I’ve spend 5k on crypto this month... perspective helps.
