According to OP, the names match.

Yeah some drunk guy went on an epic rant in a post and in the midst of it misspelled ‘hold’ - caught on as a meta meme and then evolved into the mantra it is today.

That’s not actually it’s origin. Someone made that up recently.

A stop order is just a market order that gets placed automatically at a certain price point. It’s no different, other than convenience, than if you were sitting there watching the price, decided it was time, and placed a normal market order. You still have to deal with immediate volatility and pay whatever price is current when your order goes through. The stop price you set is just the trigger for a market order.  
A limit order actually has restrictions on the price you’re willing to pay. It doesn’t just place a market order, it actually controls and restricts the price to your set amount so that no transaction will process at a “worse” price than that.

How do bitcoins prevent website maintenance? You don't need your banks website to spend your money.

More detail: I'm new to the bitcoin thing. I joined Coinbase and set up a link with my checking account. I made a relatively small purchase (~.125btc / ~$35usd) to test the waters. It went through without issue, and I liked the process, so I decided to make a bigger purchase. I placed an order for .25btc. I had changed nothing about my account, although after I placed the order, I ended up transferring most of my initial .125 order to another account on another site. And then today I received this email. Thoughts from on anyone on what might have gotten me flagged?

Depends on where you are. I'm in the US and I use Coinbase. A lot of people (including myself in the past) complain about Coinbase - but if you have some patience, they're actually really easy to use and nice to work with.

No, I don't, sorry. I've heard a lot of people outside the US mention BitStamp, so maybe check them out - but I don't know anything about them. 
Ps your DNA sounds dangerous.

I assume from your comment that others have posted the same issue? My mistake - honestly, I jumped on and submitted hastily, and admittedly didn't search for other similar posts. My bad.

I understand that there are those within the community that want bitcoin to be fully embraced as a working currency, rather than merely seen as an investment mechanism. So to those people, please don't be offended by this question - I'm truly curious to hear opinions and/or if there's a side of things I'm not understand or viewing correctly:
With the rapidly increasing "value" of bitcoin, don't you see it as a waste, to spend today's value on something tangible? Maybe there's something I'm not understanding, but to me, it seems crazy to spend bitcoins purchasing something that you could otherwise purchase in cash. 
My view: Today I can purchase thing X for $10. 
In cash: Today I have 10 less USD, and $10 worth of X. A month from now, I have 10 less USD, and $10 worth of X. 
In bitcoin: today I have $10 less bitcoin, and $10 worth of X. A month from now I have ~$17 less bitcoin, and $10 worth of X. 
It just seems like throwing away money to me. Can someone explain?
