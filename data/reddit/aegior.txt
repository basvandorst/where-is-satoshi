[First they slammed the door in our face](
[Then they backed down a bit, but the new policy still includes telemetry with no clear explanation that isn't part of the opt-out clause](
Regardless, data collection for PAID services should be opt-in, not opt-out. If you're a Plex user, consider checking out Emby... but I have my list of complaints with that also.

Basic plan is 15 users iirc, not sure if that's concurrent or total and I don't think the devs are entirely sure either, researched this pretty heavily and decided not to pay for Emby premiere. 
Still sucks that Emby can't have anything like @_date: 2018-01-29 17:34:35
The sad part is most of his post is now moot, Plex absolutely does collect telemetry on media as of a few months ago.

Having to pay per concurrent user. They don't pay for the server hosting they just make the software, so it doesn't make any difference to them how many users we have connecting to our servers.
The devs give some half baked answer about how it's necessary to prevent somebody from sharing with thousands of others, when it could obviously also be solved by authenticating one server PER paying user similar to Plex.

Excuse my ignorance, but what does Coinbase do that Circle doesn't?
I've used Coinbase, then Circle came out and It seemed universally easier and faster. I figured Coinbase would step their game up or decline.
