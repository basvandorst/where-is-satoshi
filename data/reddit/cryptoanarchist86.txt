That's like saying I should have sold my house in 2007 because it lost value on 2008. 
BTC is a better store of value than gold and it's more liquid. 20k was an all time high but any one in the space knows well see 50k by the end of 2018. 
The "smart" move would have been to sell at 20k for USD or anither currency and buy back at 10k. Rinse and repeat.

Deal. I'll sell you bitcoin at a 10% fee for the exchange rate at the moment of the transaction. I'll accept  PayPal.

I literally get sick of hearing the word Bitcoin when they really mean Bitcoin Cash. Let your altcoin stand on its own merit...oh wait, it can't. ��

Haha that was my question! Because BTC has a utility...And people use it as an investment as well. ETH has a utility and so does XMR and ADA and ZEC and so many others...but they are also speculated on and used as investments as well. 
I'd actually like to read the bill itself to see how it's worded.

Isn't that how most of these exchange "hacks" go!? Lol

But couldn't you still earn fees with a Pos? Why wast all that energy for a PoW when it's no longer necessary for the security of the network?

I thought the hack was on some third party API integrations anyway and not on Binance directly??

Haha turn em in and make that mula!! Lmao

Damn...I should have paid more attention. Fuck Roger Ver! Lmao

Quantum computing is still a ways out too. I'm not concerned about advances in hardware eventually leading to easier ways of collision attacks either. Sha256 is just a beefed up sha1 and sha1 was used to replace MD5...and before MD5 was MD4...MD3...MD2...MD1...eventually everything gets broken. Sha256 will be no different and I doubt we have to wait for quantum computers for it to happen. 
There are over a 1000 cryptos each with different protocals. The innovation in applied cryptography has been unprecedented over the last decade. It's nuts how fast this space moves. 
When a known vulnerability in sha256 is discovered, it will most likely be a "hypothetical" vulnerability long before it's every practical and a hardforked update to the "next best thing" will no doubt happen before anyone breaks it in the real world. 
As far as when the last coin is mined...then a PoW algo is pointless so a switch to a PoS algo is much more likely at this point.
