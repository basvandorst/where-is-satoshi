I am both a Bitcoin user, reddit moderator, and would be willing to pay for high-quality porno (assuming the content is decent).
In particular, I enjoy paying/tipping ladies to do things online... would be a good "choose your own adventure" -type thing for certain genres/forums.

Whomever this pioneer chooses to be... they'll make *a killing* being the first [and them one of many] in the industry to accept a more-clandestine currency...

*maybe if we cite this sensationalized headline a few more times it won't feel like ten dollars were earnt*
oh, and nobody in the BTC community cares; she MADE A MISTAKE. /admin/BitCrunch: take a deep breath, inhale.

Fingers crossed, hoping the Chinese don't panic rush... but that'll just make cheap BTC to snatch up =P

 mod here *came for some ¢en¢e*:
First, **thank you** for not permabanning this particular username in its neutral attempt among the mod team at ~~the former~~ *This shadow is an obvious derivative of my more-prevalent pseudonym, whom a few have met IRL over at events*. **I owe you all burgers**.
2) *Should* you decide to bring back [my opinion, for what it's worth, is **yes you ought'ta**], obviously Fawksey would be black-listed from the team (although *hopefully not from posting*). Keep me as mod and I will continue to assist in keeping things clean [however ~~oops yes I did get some bad publicity during the whole VA thing~~ sorry team!!] and illicit-link-**free**.
3) This place isn't perfect. Sure, I've started tons of subs that have ended up banned [come on, But why, for example, is on the shit-list? TONS of potential [I KID] but until that day, I guess just find us over in (~~*cannot believe we haven't done something with this, yet*~~ Actually, yeah I can! ). 
Lastly, let's give some time for both sides to cool off a bit. I won't hold my breath, but should I wake up one day to the smiles of BTC-hungry volunteers, *I will again be forever grateful*.
