Do all business owners use offshore accounts to evade taxes?


For the same reasons people with nothing to hide refuse to let authorities search their houses or cars without a warrant.

Privacy issues, resistance to government oversight, against the spirit of crypto currencies.
In the US, one is already required to report capital gains, and money-laundering is against the law.

Assuming everyone is using Bitcoin just to evade taxes is unimaginative.

Serious question. Developer/designer here, and I think the site is clean and functional. Granted, it is a semi-generic looking bootstrap site. Is that what prompted you to comment on the UI?

No. Hipaa means Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. It applies to the healthcare industry only.
*HIPAA is the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. The primary goal of the law is to make it easier for people to keep health insurance, protect the confidentiality and security of healthcare information and help the healthcare industry control administrative costs.* (source)[

I have an online bot that is built on PHP. As much as I would like to spam the link, that wouldn't really be in the spirit of things.   
**Language:**  
I got some flak about PHP not being fast enough to conduct trades. Bitstamp will temp-ban your IP if you hit the site more than once a second. Except in periods of very high activity, several seconds or minutes can pass between trades. There is really no need to ping it that frequently. My bot works just fine and handles multiple users. Choice of language should be whatever works for you.  
**Implementation:**  
You can communicate with Bitstamp via REST or Streaming API. Mine just uses REST, which is about as simple as it can get. Either way, you will need some way to communicate with Bitstamp. Since my bot is a web app, I really have two parts to it. I have a simple daemon running in the background that polls Bitstamp every N seconds, and updates the database. Then I have another set of code that handles the creation of the view in the browser. There is a fair bit of javascript that is used to asynchronously communicate with the database on the back end.  
**Trading Strategy:**  
My bot uses a very simple buy low, sell high strategy, and has a couple options for limit transactions. I don't know anything about trading strategy, but I was able to figure out this one on my own. The actual logic is ridiculously simple, and I am confident that you have the ability to work it out.  
**3rd Party Bots:**  
As long as you create your Bitstamp token correctly, there shouldn't be a problem. I explicitly instruct bot operators that when creating their Bitstamp key for my platform, they do not check the box that allows withdrawals from that account. If for some reason there is an issue (like the 3rd party gets compromised), the worst that can happen is you end up long or short. Prudence also dictates that the API information be encrypted in the database. I don’t know how the other bots are implemented, but that seems the most sensible way to limit potential damage. It’s also important to have a really good password because if that API Key is compromised, the attacker will have part of your actual log-in information.  
**How to Start:**  
Start writing some simple test code. I probably started with a simple function just to indicate if some value was lower or higher than some other value. Then write some code to see if you can retrieve Bitstamp data using the REST API. Then see if you can parse the JSON and pull the 'last' value. Then see if you can feed that number to your high/low function. Eventually as you start experimenting with parts and pieces, you will have blocks that you can string together in some fashion. I think my first working proof-of-concept was a bot that would conduct fixed-price orders.  
**Fin:**  
I have my proof of concept code if you want it. I had it available for a while but I pulled it down.  It is rough and requires a web server to use, but you can look at the code if you want, such as it is. WAMP and LAMP platforms are freely available, so it is pretty simple to run your own test server. The code is several iterations older than the code I am using now, but it runs. Let me know if you want a copy, and I will put up a link somewhere. Obviously my implementation will be different than yours, but it might give you an idea or two.

That's a valid concern. At the moment, my bot only does sell high, buy low. Actually, it will sell wherever the user tells it to sell, and buy wherever the user tells it to buy. Is that subject to the same issue? There only strategy is "I bought at x, and when it gets to y, sell", that sort of thing.
It seems to me at most, if I cared to look, would be to know at what points people are selling and buying, and their margins.


I say things like that a lot also, but in truth, unless you know how to code, you are not going to put together your own app, much less keep all of the supporting hardware and software up to date. And coding is actually pretty hard. It seems like there would be a large group of people that want their own simple bots, but do not have the ability to code their own.
I appreciate your input. That's valuable information to me. The only real issues I had thought about were securing credentials in the database, and making it so the bot couldn't actually transfer funds. Since there is no real logic, I never thought about protecting it. Something to mull over.

I have a Bitcoin lottery that I developed and was left with. I can't run it, and nobody seemed interested in it. Same boat though. I'm a developer, not a marketer.
@_date: 2016-03-07 20:03:32
Unless you wrote it yourself, it's all 3rd party, isn't it? I very much agree with the sentiment though; 3rd party software should be approached with caution, especially when it comes to Bitcoin related apps.
[Perhaps use an online trading bot?]( This one cannot transfer funds at all; only buy and sell on a single BitStamp account. (Disclaimer: this is my bot, and it has been operating online for over 2 years).
Sure, corrupt operators could capture user credentials before the site encrypts them, but that can be said of any site.

True, and it pissed me off then too. At some point, one has to stop being complacent about it.

That's what happens when your connection gets throttled - your IP address is on a list of those hitting their servers too many times in too short of a time span. When I wrote by trading bot, I had to make sure it wasn't hitting the exchange servers more than once a minute, otherwise my server IP address would get blocked.

BitInstant is not always easy. I quit using them because 4 out of 5 transactions had to be followed up with multiple emails with Bitinstant customer support to get it to go through, and that was well before the hack.
Not instant. Not easy. No longer a choice for me.
