Can you explain in a bit more detail the mechanism by which this dramatic change is going to happen? Your post reads like a utopian pipe dream.

Hell, even calling that an argument is generous. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 04:38:09
I don't think your math makes sense. Where are you getting a "1-2%" degree? What does that figure even mean? Are you arguing that a deflationary currency will encourage greater discretion from investors? 
Where on earth did the derivatives argument come from? I could write a derivative just as easily in USD as I could in BTC... you realize there's no difference there, from an investors perspective, right?

See, I HOPE he doesn't hold any Bitcoins right now. Andreesen is talking about the technology, and its potential to drastically lower the friction of international transactions. People holding BTC right now are speculating, relying on hype over the cool technology driving massive price swings.
There's no piece of Andreesen's logic that ALSO allows for a few nerds who ran GPUs mining BTC, or bought BTC early, to suddenly be massively wealthy. The TECHNOLOGY has potential to be successful. The INVESTMENT is a pyramid scheme.

So when you store value in currency, you're fighting the discount rate - the time value of money, usually simplified to the risk-free rate, or the nominal return you get on a bond that you consider to be almost 100% likely to pay its coupon. The idea of storing value is that when you store value at very low risk, you're not supposed to be compensated very well for that - all you're doing is holding off spending for now. 
When you make the monetary supply nominally fixed, which is what bitcoin does by design, the force on the other side of the discount rate kicks in - innovation and the growth of the economy. In a "stable bitcoin world" (one where bitcoin is widely adopted, not fluctuating in price, and can be used for almost all transactions), once all the bitcoin is minted, an investor can capture the entire growth of the economy, with no risk, by simply postponing spending.
In sum - right now, just having the luxury to not spend your money right now earns you the risk free rate (let's call it 3% to be generous). In a stable bitcoin world, having that luxury earns you the indexed growth of the economy. 
So, the answer to your question depends on what your projections of future global GDP growth are, and whether you think it's more fair/equitable/desirable for a currency to preserve buying power over time, or function as an investment vehicle.

ding ding ding ding! That's why all the smart money is in infrastructure and services companies, and all the dumb money is long on massive piles of bitcoin.

Cool stuff! Congrats!
Question for you - did you take advantage of any tax incentives or similar projects to do this project? Any complications or confusion in settling out the dollar value of the investment?

Would love to see an answer on this as well. Losing $500k+ is evidence of a terrible investing decision... 
@_date: 2014-11-10 04:04:43
So realistically speaking, do you really think that there's a strong chance that a $1000 USD investment today could/should appreciate so much that it can support a full retirement in ~65 years? Where does that growth come from? Why has it not been arbitraged out of the marketplace by savvy investors seeking alpha? Do you know something the market doesn't?

Great description, one caveat. "Inflation" is often represented as you did in the end as an increase in money supply. This is subtly incorrect. Inflation is an increase in nominal prices - full stop. While increasing the money supply, all other things held constant, leads logically to inflation, the two are not the same.

Bitcoin COMPANIES. Service providers. That's what he's saying is the smart bet - not buy-and-hold speculation with actual bitcoins.

What comments like this fail to understand is what the point of deposit insurance is. It's to create confidence in the banking system, lowering the likelihood of harmful runs, and making it possible for fractional reserve banking to work. 
What people tend to forget then is that fractional reserve banking is not an evil or shady thing, but rather the engine of the entire global economy.
What they tend to forget next is that if governments required banks to carry full reserve, the same service the fractional reserve banking provides would appear IMMEDIATELY in the private sector, because, it's the ENGINE OF THE ENTIRE GLOBAL ECONOMY.

Ohhhh sweet Mary please take a macroeconomics class
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:23:47
this is the correct answer.

I think you have a strong intuition for some of the fundamentals of investing - good on you! That said I would encourage you to think differently about "Free leeway" an investment is given. In the world today, inflation is considered to be an exogenous factor - it's like gravity, it just happens. You can hedge against it in a number of ways, including investing in real assets (like mines, or timber land) whose value remains strong regardless of the capriciousness of exchange rates. 
A better base-rate to consider might be the risk-free rate. How much is the market willing to pay you for a zero-risk investment? It feels like a simple thing - call it the discount rate, or the 20-year-T-bond. But what it really is is an expectation on the prospects of the global economy in the future. Do you think we will create more growth in 10 years, or less? We're riding a hockey-stick trend of GDP growth, even with the recession. If you think it's here to stay, inflation makes sense. If you think it's going to stop, then we might be transitioning into a wealth-preservation economy that looks very, very different from what we see now.

I'd welcome a source on that older use of inflation, as I've only ever been taught that the word has a strict definition - nominal price increases. Again it's a bit semantic, but the causation/correlation of money supply and price is important enough to macroeconomics that I think it's very much worth drawing the distinction.

What exactly does "its currency aspect" mean to you? A currency has to do three things: Be a medium of exchange (bitcoin is good and getting better at this), be a store of value (bitcoin is currently very bad at this, and in a stable bitcoin world will be a bad long-term store of value, but a good short-term store of value), and be a means for assessing and comparing value (bitcoin is currently very bad at this, and in a stable bitcoin world would be as good as current currencies are).
So what exactly is its "currency aspect"? What is this strength you're describing?
Bitcoin's biggest strength is decentralization and decreased friction, no?
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:36:23
That's a great answer, thanks. The right question to ask might actually be "is bitcoin an investment with an intrinsic properties, or a currency?" Or, can it be both? I don't think so.

Ad hominem and speculation about my credentials aside...
Losing $500K, or even $1, because you entrusted it in the hands of fraudsters is ALWAYS evidence of poor judgment. I am aware of the distinction between unrealized and realized losses, but this is not a case of  foreseeable volatility - this is a case of playing fast and loose with assets without understanding the risks.
It is deeply troubling that OP, who is regarded as an expert in cryptocurrency, was conned to the tune of $500K+ by a party that does not strike me as particularly sophisticated. That's true whether that $500K was all of his net worth, or 0.001%.
Also, in my experience, not many "serious investors" are terribly concerned with "what the community needs". What this, and any investing community, needs is facts.

Honest question - what's the business model for a full reserve bitcoin exchange?
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:19:18
That's a very fair assessment, but it treats bitcoin as an investment with an intrinsic value, not as a currency. It seems that bitcoin enthusiasts can't have it both ways, especially since its intrinsic value is driven solely by an assumption of broad adoption throughout the economy (correct?)
Can an advocate really say its great value is as a currency, and then expect me to not be alarmed that they treat it solely as an investment?
@_date: 2014-03-27 02:08:59
Of course you're right. However, in this case the investors are not providing any capital to the people developing the technology. People squatting/speculating on Bitcoin are not really making their wealth available to the people developing the technology for frictionless transactions. If anything, the massive price volatility that speculators ("investors") in Bitcoin are creating are making it more difficult to capitalize technological development.
@_date: 2014-11-10 06:08:32
Thanks for a well-reasoned and informative response. One of my biggest hang-ups with the bitcoin world is the frenetic way many people describe it. There's so much being discussed - payment networks, anonymity, decentralization, reduced friction. All of these arguments make sense in an atomistic way.
Add on this fundamental skepticism of monetary policy, and I get confused. Is this about reducing friction, or exploding the fed? What conversation are we even having?
Thanks again for your thoughts.
