Coinomi support update:   SOL basically...?  Didn't find any malicious software on my devices with a scan, and my phone was in my pocket all day long, so nobody would have physically had any access to it but myself.  Ugh.
 
"Hi Aaron,
Each and every transaction from the app requires confirmation of your password before being sent (your private keys are kept encrypted at all times with the password, so even if the app wanted, it would not be able to decrypt the keys without the password)  
Unauthorized transactions can only be made by a) someone who has access to your seed phrase, or b) someone with access to your device and knows your password. There is no other way.  
We occasionally receive news of users having their email accounts hacked, giving attackers access to their seed backup files kept on their email. Please review your seed [backup security]( try to remember if you ever entered your seed on any other wallet or website, or check if anyone could have accessed the app on your device and knows your password.  
How exactly did you set up the phone to store the BTC? We see from the transaction history that the first deposits were from 2017​. When managing/transferring a phrase is when keyloggers/malware have a chance to attack.  
Kind Regards,
Coinomi Support"

Either that or what?  No idea, contacted support to no avail so far.  Any ideas would be welcomed.

Yesterday morning.  Btc then left the account at ~7am.  Pretty much right after I set it up.

Just had it leftover from the fork.  Bummer either way.  Thanks for your constructive criticisms.

I sent a ticket to Coinomi, I doubt they can help as there are already confirmations, but we'll see I suppose.  Android, [ Up to date, Coinomi is the only questionable I suppose, don't use it for much beside text and now a btc wallet.  Did have a password on my coinomi wallet, not 2FA though, not sure if that's even available, but I haven't looked in that deeply. 
I'll just wait for support, thanks for the help.

Thanks for following them around, I saw they moved around a bit and then just couldn't get myself to keep going down the depressing rabbit hole.  I submitted a ticket with Coinomi, so we'll see, but I doubt they can do anything if the confirmations have already gone though, yeah?  Stinks.

Yeah, phone app.  Had my seed written down, nowhere else.  Just so confused at what I did wrong.

On a piece of paper in my safe.  Only time I ever used it was during Coinomi setup.  Have it nowhere electronic. :(

Appreciate the support.  I am going through these questions with Coinomi support still, so we will see how it turns out.  I can say I have run several scans to see if there was any type of malware on my device and have come up empty.  I submitted a report to ic3.gov as well, which is why I basically stopped posting publicly about the incident, will just see how things pan out.  Thanks again.
