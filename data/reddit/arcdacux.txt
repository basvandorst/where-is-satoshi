She has always been into investing in stocks and such. Watches the stock market a lot and has probably heard about bitcoin plenty. She finally got a chance to get into it and get the techy people in my family to explain it to her. I do expect her to hodl it.

I'm assuming it has different names. Everyone brings gifts. Pick a number out of a hat for when you go. When it's your turn you either open an unopened gift or steal from someone else. Gifts can only be stolen 2 times. Rules probably vary by family though but that's how we play.

You're welcome! Merry Christmas!

She's not techy at all. She thought it was a physical currency because my uncle covered a roll of pennies with a piece of paper saying bitcoin on it. She kinda understood once we all explained it to her.

I'm in the states but I've never heard it called that. Guess there are a lot of names for it lol.

Yaaa ;_; Not how I expected it but ok. I mean I got food in the end which is always good to have. Can't complain. Everyone ended up happy with what they got.

She's got some good time left. But it would be very funny if she explicitly puts in a line saying that.

Not sure what my uncle will do about that. Cause that will take a good chunk out of it... Probably switch to another crypto then transfer and then switch back to avoid the fees.
