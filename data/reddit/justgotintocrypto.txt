The only way to stop this is to stop reading these posts.
I haven’t read your moaning either. Feeling just fine.
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:30:00
Yep, give it 20-30 years 
@_date: 2018-12-09 04:21:29
Read your post. You ARE an idiot.
@_date: 2018-12-08 13:54:28
Financial institutions that you all been waiting for
@_date: 2018-12-13 08:51:10
They have to gain some credibility, therefore they might be right

What made you register on Reddit last week? 
@_date: 2018-12-18 06:59:41
To be greedy when all are in fear ��
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:34:02
Do you realize that you are a dumb ass? 
@_date: 2018-12-13 08:52:04
Human stupidity will always slow down the progress

When feds have been watching you for years, you are fucked so much so giving up your private keys won’t do any good.
@_date: 2018-12-13 10:41:05
Don’t fuck with US unless you are in Russia, where US can’t extradite from

They are unbanked because most of them don’t need banks due to the lack of basic education.

Another great business idea would be to contact some Nigerian prince so that you can transfer him a small amount in exchange for millions ��
@_date: 2018-12-09 14:25:57
How much of a dumb fuck do you have to be to not see a total idiot who is not adapted to fucking life on the planet earth?
This dude is stupid as fuck and his story is unbelievably dumb.
@_date: 2018-12-18 07:12:34
How are they fucked if they never reported shit in the first place?
@_date: 2018-12-18 07:10:46
If Gov finds out you just get on a payment plan. I never heard of someone going to jail for failing to file.
Good thing about crypto, if you become a millionaire, you can go anywhere on earth cash out there and never come back to your country. Government doesn’t really give a shit about you when you’re overseas.
@_date: 2018-12-07 15:42:25
LOL ))
@_date: 2018-12-17 15:06:44
Just like you took out a 30-year mortgage without understanding how shit works and how much money you will lose through the 30-year term.
Most people are stupid and that's totally fine.
@_date: 2018-12-16 04:07:47
BS idea
@_date: 2018-12-09 04:18:21
If you weren’t an idiot you’d get yourself a hardware walled. Idiot.

There is no jail time for something that is not under your control. 
Google “Cook Island Asset Protection” ��
@_date: 2018-12-18 01:40:06
As soon as BTC goes up by a few %, there are tons of idiots like you are coming out on air with great stories on how they made lots of money 
@_date: 2018-12-13 06:11:45
We don’t need most shit that’s sold in US. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 04:23:13
There is no way to seize Bitcoin without keys. In your example criminals would give away their keys to the government on specific terms.
@_date: 2018-12-13 05:47:31
Always been
@_date: 2018-12-12 20:20:23
What a bunch of bullshit. Investors don’t trade in and out of the security, traders do.
Investors don’t have to pay shit, since they never realized their gains and/or losses.

Exit scam? ��

Free is free. You don’t usually earn/win something that’s free.
@_date: 2018-12-18 08:33:12
Stop this jail shit already

Teach your child to work hard. It doesn’t matter what he will be getting in return for his work.

No court can order you to give up your coins if you “forgot” a key to your wallet ��
@_date: 2018-12-09 04:09:56
@_date: 2018-12-18 01:37:23
Of course it did, fucking spammer you are
@_date: 2018-12-18 08:24:47
Why do people use all those fucked up no-name exchanges when there is Binance
@_date: 2018-12-17 08:48:37
There will always be an idiot to use these overpriced ATM’s mostly in small amounts, because idiots usually don’t have much spare cash.
I’ve seen quite a few of these ATMs installed and deinstalled in about 6 months due to the owner not getting enough money to cover land leasing fees.
@_date: 2018-12-09 14:17:00
I don’t believe his story because he is not mentioning anything on the hardware wallet that he supposedly had an issue with.
NOTHING can happen to a hardware wallet. Even if it is lost, you can easiy restore everything on a new one. This dude is either a total idiot or he is not telling the truth.
@_date: 2018-12-07 21:45:17
HODLers, huh? ��
@_date: 2018-12-13 06:08:45
What a dumb ass. Go die.
@_date: 2018-12-18 01:35:07
It’s kinda stupid to buy a miner, even 10 years ago it was financially feasible to buy BTC instead of stupid hardware
@_date: 2018-12-18 05:43:05
Most reddit imbiciles do.
@_date: 2018-12-07 22:07:11
That’s exactly what I meant. Easiest way to HODL these days is to buy some crypto, commit the crime, go to jail for few years and get out hoping that you didn’t invest into a shitcoin ��
Most niggas may turn out to be millionaires in few years, enslaving white trash dudes like you and I ��
@_date: 2018-12-17 16:51:27
Stupid are supposed to act that way. It’s all good for the crypto.
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:32:15
I think you are a non-believing dumb ass
@_date: 2018-12-09 06:20:09
Only an idiot can have any kind of incident with hardware wallet.
 Sorry bud, you are one hell of a loser.

Answer to these questions may later be used by algorythms  from IRS and other organizations to pinpoint a person.
