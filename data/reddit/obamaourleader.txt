Don't be a tard anyone with some skid skills can fully crypt a shitty keylogger that can be FULLY undetected in windows OS &amp; remain undetected forever unless he stops updating it remotely or infect's thousands which is then finally detected by AV companies. Only way to avoid this is to not get infected in the first place &amp; not visiting unknown sites.

I saw people on  (evolution market) selling hacked bitcoin wallets by the thousands, i read the comments for one &amp; a guy found 30btc on one. Your wallet may be one of the ones that was hacked.

Most users that started the momentom of bitcoin knew about the code looking pretty clean. Apart from that i think that with all the bust the F.B.I has done on people on tor, bitcoin being involved in most of them they would have pulled out there NSA vested backdoor bitcoin card.
