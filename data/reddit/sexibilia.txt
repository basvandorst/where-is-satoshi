It is not so. US financed WWII with taxes and war bonds.
From above: "The big question is how to pay for it. To a degree that will surprise many, the US funded its World War II effort largely by raising taxes and tapping into Americans' personal savings."
The boring truth is that being unable to print money will cut off one source of war funding. Which will make it harder to finance war. But no more than that; long wars will by no mean become improbable or impossible.

Ethereum will inflate at 0.26 the Genesis amount annually, i.e. a fixed absolute number and hence a declining percentage.
@_date: 2014-07-14 15:42:59
Thanks, again, very interesting.


Yes. Though, strictly speaking, it also goes the other way round. If price drops then we need less security (using more is wasteful), and the current system also does this (lessen security when price drops). My problem is that the lock-step relation between price and security may break without block rewards (ignoring your volume/price link for now).


I don't see where I assumed this. Even if the price remains unchanged, my problem remains if block rewards run out (i.e. we lose at least one source of a virtuous price/security link so attack incentives can overpower security incentives).


Agreed, if volume pushes price then security will rise. This is a price/security link I overlooked, thanks. One problem, however, is that if the transactions pushing price are mostly off-chain, then the security bump may not happen (or be very weak).


Excellent point. I did not realize that bitcoin is over-secure to such a degree.  So maybe my point won't matter as bitcoin can remain secure at much lower security. (Hell, the mechanism I mentioned may even be useful to lower security as excessive security is wasteful.)


Excellent point I overlooked, thanks.
Thanks for the discussion, it was very enlightening. I think it ultimately boils down to two issues, namely (1) how many transactions will remain on-chain and (2) how much can security drop before it becomes a problem.
@_date: 2014-08-13 12:06:52
So? The point is that it will not inflate at 26% annually, but at some fixed number which is 26% in the first year, a lesser percentage every year thereafter. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 14:09:54
Thanks. I still don't quite get why dealing with balances only would lead to a double spend problem. If each block only contained updated balances and all prior balances associated with updated addresses were stripped out, why would this stop us from achieving consensus among nodes as is done now?
@_date: 2014-07-14 14:21:09
Sure, there is some incentive to mine. The question is whether the incentive is strong enough. And the answer is that, under such a situation, miners are in a prisoner's dilemma, which never ends well.
@_date: 2014-07-26 18:28:14
Oh, I should have been clearer, I was not talking about tx fees. 
As the added bitcoin in the block rewards makes the coins already in existence worth less, you can think of the block reward as a fee all people who hold bitcoin pay the miners for providing security. Hence if the block reward is high we are overpaying, etc.
@_date: 2014-10-15 13:03:46


Are you kidding?
@_date: 2014-10-26 12:27:02
Yes you can. You do run counterparty risk though.
@_date: 2014-07-14 12:58:57


The problem is that the value of all coins depends partly on the security of the network (i.e. no-one would put in serious cash if hashing power is very low). With mining, the incentive to mine increases, all else being equal, as the price of coins increase, and thereby security is increased as a knock-on effect of a price rise. This virtuous link is gone when mining is finished.
With no mining (or POS), it seems we get stuck in a prisoner's dilemma. Everyone is better off 'cheating', i.e. avoiding transacting or transacting off-chain if they can.  So a few people pay for the security that influences the value of everyone's coins.

@_date: 2014-05-07 21:02:25
OK, I understand. I had actually thought along somewhat similar lines myself, though I am not inclined to call it 'intrinsic value' as per my definition. But that is just semantics. The point you make, as I understand it, as that bitcoin lowers transaction costs and this makes it intrinsically, in some sense, suited for commerce. I very much agree with that.
@_date: 2014-07-14 22:57:42
Yes, I understand shorting and agree that crypto needs to be protected even against those who do something for the hell of it. Can I ask your opinion on something, since you seem to know as much an anyone on this board?
Stipulate, for the sake of argument, that a transaction fee only system cannot work. This would seem to imply that all coins, whether POW or POS, would have to eternally inflate in order to pay miners/stakers. Is there any way around this, i.e. there any way to avoid eternal inflation? 
Here is one option, call it Negative POS: After coins are distributed, it goes full POS, but with a twist. You don't gain anything if you stake, rather you risk losing coins if you don't stake. So you implement some rule like "If ever the amount of staked coins falls under 50% of all coins, wallets not staking during that time lose X % of their coins. Lost coins are destroyed." Where X is some tiny number that is sufficient to incentivise staking.
What I like about the scheme is that it is non-inflationary POS and that it seems to get the incentives right as everyone has a reason to stake. This is especially relevant if my worry about a pure tx fee system turn out to be a real issue for POW coins and so they cannot ever really drop block rewards. (Of course a Negative POS coin should also have transaction fees as anti-spam device.)
An added benefit is that such a coin won't face the constant selling pressure of POW-in-mining-phase coins and traditional POS coins. You can do distribution quickly and settle into Negative POS very early in the life of the coin (i.e. you don't have to wait till transaction fees can support security as in a POW coin.)
I am coming at this from a game theory/incentives angle, so I don't know if it is technically feasible. Any thoughts on such a system?
Edit: Ignore, for now, the 'nothing at stake' issue.
@_date: 2014-07-14 11:52:47
Is it genuinely feasible to ever move to a transaction fee only system once all coins are mined? Won't it amount to those who move coins paying for the security from which all holders benefit, which is a terrible incentive system?
And if not, does it not mean that bitcoin will have to be changed so that it will have to always inflate, even if slowly and predictably?

If you are using it as a store of value, you are gaining utility. And then the economic value of your coins partially depends on security that someone else is paying for.
I agree about the potential problems with off-chain transactions, but that is irrelevant here. The point is that it will happen, non-trivial fees will incentivise off-chain transactions, and such transactions don't help security.
Thanks for the information about current and potential fees, it is interesting.
I think we are talking past one another. Think of it this way: security provided by mining effectively amounts to a system where all people who hold bitcoin collectively pay for security (same goes for POS), as the extra coins effectively devalue our holdings in proportion to how much we actually have. Economically it is the same as a flat (percentage) tax on holdings. Spreading the burden this way means that all people who benefit are also paying for security. Agreed?

Thanks for the answer. I still don't get: if each block only contained updated balances and all prior balances associated with updated addresses were stripped out, why would this stop us from achieving consensus among nodes? I mean, if a node updates in a deviant way, its broadcast message could still be rejected by the majority. Why is the current system better?

Yes, 'paper wallet' is a bad term as in, bitcoinspeak, the term 'wallet' sometimes means a an address, sometimes a collection of addresses and sometimes the client you use to transfer funds + a collection of addresses.  
A paper wallet is just a printed address for which you have the private key. To transfer money you have to import it into some or other program that can send messages to the network.
If you use an online wallet, for safety you should afterwards transfer all unused funds to a different paper wallet.

True, but as block rewards make coins in existence worth less, block rewards are effectively a way we pay miners as well. I suspect we are overpaying, i.e. the network is more secure than necessary.

@_date: 2014-07-14 14:01:58
Agreed, I could then move my coins. But in a situation where mining has almost ground to a halt security would be so weak (i.e. double spending so cheap) that my coins are almost worthless.
So the coins are secure, but their value destroyed because of people like me who don't transact. That is the crux of my problem.

Good point that is too frequently overlooked. All kinds of things can happen if on-chain value and mining rewards are no longer correlated.
@_date: 2014-05-07 18:34:07
Possibly true, but you miss the point. 'Instrinsic value' means 'value independent of its use as medium of exchange'. Meaning 'will people still want it if it is not a currency'?
Gold has intrinsic value, bitcoin does not. Of course, I think bitcoin proves currencies need not have intrinsic value.

@_date: 2014-07-14 14:06:33
Agreed. However, my problem concerns a pure transaction fee system. Here people who transact a lot pay for the security of the system, people who store coins, but transact rarely, pay very little and people who only do off-chain stuff pay nothing. So the incentives favour off-chain transactions and on-chain storage, yet the fees come from on-chain transactions. The incentives seem out of whack as all three classes of people benefit from the security provided by miners, but security paid for by only one group.

They are just covering themselves legally and morally. Whether it is supposed to be a coin or not has nothing to do with anything. The point is that it can be used in this way. Gold was not supposed to be a store of value, wood was never supposed to be used for furniture, etc.
And it does not have 26% inflation. 
The point is this: let's say that there is a substantial demand for space on their network and Ether is the only way to acquire that space. Then Ether becomes a currency backed by that space. That is one big plus, the second being that ETH can do anything bitcoin can, but not vice versa.

The problem is that incentives are misaligned. It is a basic principle of good institutional design that the cost of something must be paid by those who benefit. If I do off-chain transactions only, I benefit from the security in the system (without it my coins are worthless), but pay nothing (or a trivial amount).
My point is not about what is 'fair' or makes sense, it is about whether a system like this can work if the incentives are out of whack. I fear that a transaction fee only system may be in principle unworkable for game theoretical reasons.
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:01:38
@_date: 2014-07-26 16:32:50
That could also work. Though I suspect we are overpaying them as it is (i.e. block rewards are way more than needed to incentivise adequate security).

- It will lead to a custodial model with significant centralization: Agreed. It is a downside, but we cannot have everything. Every model will have some limits (and POW mining is already very centralised. And it seems likely that most ordinary holders will entrust their BTC to custodial accounts anyway.)
- The idea is not that everyone has to have their wallets open all the time, but you set some minimum level penalty criterium. This does, indeed, create a 'tragedy of the commons', but only a partial one as it is not a full prisoner's dilemma (as there is a level at which defecting becomes individually irrational). Basically I think the end game will be custodial accounts that are always open, which may be OK.
- The above was mostly an intellectual exercise about whether can do without inflation. I am not overly anti-inflation either. I am trying to figure out what is possible in the crypto-space. The only obvious downside of inflation is the massive constant selling pressure from miners, and even this is due to the specific front-loaded block rewards schedule chosen by Satoshi, not the nature of crypto as such. (Though it is a large part of why the alts are such pump and dump rubbish; you have to get out before miners flood the market. It would be good to avoid this.)
- Personally I think the "danger of deflation to the economy" aspect of BTC is overblown, as (1) I don't think that there is a way in the world that governments will allow BTC to become big enough to affect their ability to exercise discretionary monetary policy. So BTC had better play nice, or they will snuff it (which is not that hard, China just sneezed in our general direction and look what happened.) Also (2), once BTC hits market saturation, it will probably be only slightly deflationary and probably a worse deal than the general rate of return on capital, i.e. normal investing. At 1% price deflation only fools, and people in countries going completely to hell, will use it as a store of value.
- "particularly as a lot of PoS already works with 'age', if you spend your coin, the age resets, and age is a big factor in how much coin you can generate. So age itself already gives people a reason not to spend their coin." Good point. I am hoping this can be tweaked, I don't know enough about POS to judge.
- Related to attack incentives outpacing security incentives: I have a similar worry about colored coins and BTC. Suppose colored coins take off; then we can theoretically have a situation where the value on the blockchain is way higher than the security that miners are incentivised (by non-colored btc) to provide. (My thoughts are generally about ways in which on-chain value and security incentives can come apart.)
- Concerning your prior (excellent) point about BTC being over secure: though this may save us, it also has the downside that a massively over secure chain means that we are, collectively, massively over-paying the miners. An ideal system would have some excess security, but not ludicrously so. I am increasingly sceptical of the idea that the block reward schedule as currently implemented is even close to optimal. (I think some next gen algo that adjust the block reward schedule based on price may have virtues.)
Thanks for the discussion, I have learned a lot.

I do think the block reward schedule has been chinese water torturing us for a long time. It makes it so that low volume periods are likely to trend down. Eventually we break sharply.


True, it is about discretionary monetary policy. I do, however, think it is amazing how we trumpets the 'no inflation = evil' angle and does not notice that the block reward schedule gives it a funny kind of 'inflation'. The distribution model is the most economically interesting aspect of bitcoin. The fact that he does not seem to have noticed the reward schedule at all is indicative of the fact that he is more interested in dashing off a hacky column ragging on libertarians than coming to grips with the actual technology and economics of bitcoin.

Correct. The change address will be another address in the wallet you used to send money from the paper wallet. So you still have it; the problem comes when people don't realise that and think the money is in the now-empty paper wallet.
See here:
@_date: 2014-05-09 08:34:25
What is this nonsense? As has been made clear in the original threads, WE CANNOT AFFORD TO SPONSOR IPL. Any sort of halfway decent sponsorship will cost millions.
The IPL is a very rich league. Some not-great players cost a million dollars for a few weeks and we would have to sponsor an entire team.

I tried to explain bitcoin in terms of the blockchain as it is the key breakthrough behind bitcoin. 
* The blockchain is a public record.
* The blockchain is democratic. It is controlled by consensus.
* If the blockchain says you have twenty bitcoins, then you have twenty bitcoins. That is all; there is no physical object or government involved.
* The blockchain tells everyone when you have paid. But no-one needs to know who you are.
* The blockchain is maintained by those who compete to update it. The winner gets bitcoin.
* Paying via the blockchain is cheaper and quicker than any other system in human history. By several orders of magnitude.
* The blockchain will only ever recognise 21 million bitcoins. Guaranteed.

The idea of bitcoin, but with a Turing complete scripting language that allows for implementing any programmable contract on a decentralised network is what I find cool. It is like a more ambitious bitcoin. It is cool enough to throw some money at it in the hope that it can be made real and become popular.
I don't mean to claim that it will succeed. I think the most likely outcome is that they produce something awesome that finds very little use. (If, however, they succeed and it becomes popular, it will obviously be worth more than bitcoin pretty quickly.)

My problem is not that the rich pay the mining fees of the poor, I should have been clearer. My problem is that the security of the whole network will be paid for by those who regularly send money around. Under such a system, if I buy coins on an exchange, keep them there and eventually sell them, I contribute nothing to the miners, and hence nothing to security. Similar points hold if I do on-chain transactions, but only rarely, etc.

What is cool about bitcoin is that it is supposed to be incentive compatible; we don't rely on 'trust', we rely on incentives. These kinks have to be ironed out.

Not being able to inflate the currency makes it harder, but the real story of war financing is the modern income tax. Both [Britain and the US]( introduced it in its modern form to pay for wars.
From wiki:
"The inception date of the modern income tax is typically accepted as 1799.[5] This income tax was introduced in Britain by Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger in his budget of December 1798, to pay for weapons and equipment for the French Revolutionary War"
"The US federal government imposed the first personal income tax, on August 5, 1861, to help pay for its war effort in the American Civil War - (3% of all incomes over US $800) ($20,999 in 2014 dollars)".

Don't agree. Most commodities do not largely rely on network effects.
I would happily agree that we are in such a situation to some degree with bitcoin and merchant adoption/use. But I suspect that, if this remains so, we are fucked. I rather hope that eventually the use cases are strong enough to make this a non-issue (say, for remittances). In any case, thanks for the discussion, it was interesting.

Personally I suspect that bitcoin's schedule is far from optimal. We may well have been much better off with much smaller block rewards. Or, alternatively, with some radical alternative without any block rewards at all. Like a POS algo where all coins are distributed very quickly and then you *lose* coins if you don't stake 30% of the time. Or something like that. 
But I do hope the stars align for bitcoin in the manner you propose.

Thanks for the thoughtful answer. I agree with almost everything you say. (IIRC, one of the first uses of POW was to end spam, and the system is already in place, though without bitcoin.)


The point is that mining activity is necessary for my stored bitcoins to be valuable, even if they don't technically secure it. So those who store bitcoin on-chain directly benefit from mining, yet under a pure transaction fee system they don't pay for it. (Note, I am not here concerned with the 'fairness' of such a system, but with whether it can be sufficiently secure.)
I fully agree that we need transaction fees, even if only as an anti-spam device. And probably also as pay-per-use. And I also fully agree about the virtues and limits of off-chain stuff.
We are still slightly talking past each other. I am not talking about what really counts as 'using the system' or what is 'really a utility'. I am concerned with the economics/game theory of a pure transaction fee system. It seems to me a prisoner's dilemma.
Because: if bitcoin rises in price we need the cost of an attack to also rise (as the potential reward of such an attack has risen). The current system does this automatically; if prices rise the value of block rewards rise and so more money is invested in mining and security also rises. With no block rewards, this virtuous link (i.e. feedback effect) is broken.
With no block rewards, suddenly the value of mining, and hence security, drops. If miners compensate by raising transaction fees, this drives more transactions off-chain and incentivises using the blockchain for storage, not transacting. So now we have a negative feedback loop, anything that increases security, all else being equal, hurts on-chain volume, thereby further hurting miners and hence hurting security, and so on. I fear that the incentives of such a system forces it to implode.

It is just not so. Don't join apocalypse cults, fiat is designed to inflate and there is no reason why this must intrinsically be a problem. All it means is that you should not use it as a long-term store of value (use stocks, bonds, etc.), but no-one uses it as a store of value anyway.
I would be wary of buying in now. If ETF succeeds you should make money, but if it fails we may fall a loooong way over the next few months.
If you wish to enter, maybe put a third in now as an ETF bet, then another third in a year's time and the last third in traditional investments.

Take the advice and invest it as suggested on If you do buy bitcoin, you are not as exposed to volatility as you may think, as you are in effect doing "dollar cost average". Provided bitcoin does not utterly fail you should do OK.

False. Even if you hold it only for a short time there are others who cannot use it during that time. Hence extra demand. 
Given that we all need some money to pay taxes and otherwise interact with the state it immediately gets a non-zero value. In virtue of such facts it becomes a medium of exchange, and would do so even if *no-one whatsoever* used it to store value.
Lastly: Money is a crappy store of value by design. But there is too high a transaction cost if I were to convert to stocks every day I get paid and then flip back every day as i need to spend. Hence the velocity of money is miles from 'hold on to it for a few seconds' in practice.

1. Yes, as soon as money is held for a non-zero amount of time that is added value.
2. It is literal historical fact, first done by Kublai Khan. The fact that the government is also inflating the currency is irrelevant here.
3. Yes, people and companies do. But typically not to store value; it is an effect of the need to transact + TX costs + the value of being liquid (which is just another TX cost effect).

There is no fact of the matter about whether an amended bitcoin "really" is bitcoin or "really" is an alt. The only issue that matters is: should the block limit be increased? The rest is just semantics.
The protocol is adjustable by design. The only issue is which adjustments should be made. 
Call XT an alt if you wish. Now: should we adopt this alt as bitcoin? If it is better, why on earth not? You can tell me XT is worse, but telling me it does not matter if it is better or worse, because it is an alt is bizarre. And one-way ticket to palookaville if a technically superior alt ever does come along. (In fact, if ethereum does not scare you just a little already you don't understand the situation, because one thing bitcoin and ethereum are not is complementary.)

You start by saying it is merely 'like a ponzi' but then again end by calling it a ponzi.
Two elements of ponzi's are missing: (1) as there is no interest paid out, it need not crash. So the music never needs to stop. (2) there is no intrinsic deception. It is all open source code and you can make up your mind. (Even with the alts, there is little real deception as very few people still buy the bullshit. Alts are a kind of game.)
By your definition gambling is a ponzi. And so currency in general.
Satoshi explicitly said he expects people to speculate. But either way, his intentions are irrelevant.
@_date: 2016-10-17 19:54:54
No. But it has never been tried before either. More importantly, there is nothing incoherent about such an outcome, i.e. it violates no law of economics.
The industrial and decorative use of gold only justifies a small part of the price. Just like the darknet use of bitcoin justifies only a small part of the price. I think the two are analogous.

I hear you. Though imagine you are a well-respected cypherpunk with this great idea you publish anonymously and no-one cares. The best route may be to express interest under your real identity and get a 'conversation' going. This scenario is hardly crazy.

I see. You may be right, but one possible future I can see is where it is no longer used as a currency at all, but it retains value as a purely speculative entity. i.e. it has non-trivial value as a kind of game. And it retains prominence in virtue of being first.
@_date: 2016-10-13 21:37:43
That's just semantics. You know exactly what I mean. The United Nations is not really united, but so what?

@_date: 2016-10-16 12:09:13
Unlike most here I value your input. I do think you are wrong though. It is essential to a ponzi that it must crash. Ponzis crash because eventually the interest paid out dwarfs new capital. Bitcoin, in virtue of not paying out interest, need not crash. Bitcoin is not a stock (no dividend), but also not a ponzi (no interest). Bitcoin is an entirely new thing.
@_date: 2016-10-17 20:49:15
Why do you think speculation was small then?
@_date: 2016-10-16 21:36:59
I know there has been a lot of stuff said that may be false (i.e. it could work as a transacting currency). Such things may or may not happen, but I doubt there was always an intent to deceive. This is hardly the same as the deception in "my new factory is making millions invest now ponzy".
The only intrinsic downward pressure is from mining, the role of which steadily reduces. I assume that is not why you think it must go to zero (i.e. your objections would not disappear if we move to a POS system, which has nominal inflation but no real inflation as you precentage of coins stay constant if you stake?) I do think that it could go on effectively forever, i.e. theoretically bitcoin could be kicking around at a non-zero value when the world ends. Gold also inflates as new gold is found and its actual use also only justifies a trivial part of the price. So gold also satisfies your value in = value out criterion.
I think the pot thing is a bad analogy. Remember there is no central anything where the money goes. People just trade and the price moves. I think bitcoin market cap will rise and peak (as anything peaks at some point), then drop down and oscillate. I think bitcoin (assuming the transactional use fails) is effectively gambling but with no house edge. 
Having a virtual commodity based on nothing can actually be socially useful. As the price is based on nothing it should be uncorrelated with the real world, and so it can actually be helpful as a hedge.

@_date: 2016-10-18 20:19:05
Interesting, I agree. Though I suspect the real number must have been below 300, even at that price there would have been a lot of goldbugs in betting on a rise (and hence making price higher than it would have been if they had been out).
So you like the 'transaction value of btc' is to btc price as 'real use of gold' is to gold price? I.e. it just sets a lower limit?
@_date: 2015-10-07 07:48:31
Which is why it is good that there is more than "one guy in South Africa, a few people in Brazil and some Americans use Bitcoin" using it.

Sure, that may happen. Bitcoin's biggest medium term risk is Ethereum (I don't think the DAO matters in the long run). But all stocks eventually end at zero for the same reason, so I don't think that disqualifies it.

Roughly, on chain is like fiat with real paper bills, off chain is like electronic fiat, i.e. where all that happens is some database is suitably updated. The analogy is not perfect, but it is close. 'Without bitcoin' is only when no on chain coins exist to back the off chain transactions.

I have read it, this quote pops up on r/economics from time to time, then an argument about how to interpret it ensues. I would love for Krugman to have said something this nuts, but I am firmly in the misinterpretation camp.

I agree that you will almost always have to do illegal stuff to get a private key, so it is a theoretical issue.
The interesting thing: I am not sure that, legally, you own your bitcoins. Rather the fact that only you know your private key gives you practical ownership, even if this does not amount to legal ownership. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:50:39

I hate what Krugman said about btc as much as you do, but this quote is wildly out of context. He was not advocating a housing bubble, but pointing out that Greenspan has no viable options.
@_date: 2013-12-23 18:47:09
The analogy between gold and bitcoin is a bad one. Bitcoin is the anti-gold. Goldbugs believe that a currency has to have some inherent value, i.e. value unrelated to its use in exchange. Even fiat has such value, kind of, given that it keeps you out of jail for non-payment of taxes. Bitcoin conclusively shows that a currency need not have such value, provided it lowers transaction costs.
@_date: 2013-12-23 20:25:59
I hear you, but I have been in too many threads about that quote. I am sitting this one out. At the end of the day, I think Krugman is a great economist who sometimes lets politics could his judgment. The interpretation of this quote won't, either way, change that, so I have no skin in the game.
@_date: 2013-05-17 11:06:12
Thanks, that is very useful.
Concerning theft (4): I ask as the system does not require legal enforcement. It is not obvious to me that, if I happen to see your private key and use it, US law will consider that 'theft', even if I can prove you did it.

He needs to give it a rest already. The Stross article is crappy, as it confuses the politics of some early adopters with 'the politics of bitcoin'.
Nothing 'backs' the value of btc. The lower limit is zero, and that is just fine.

Thanks, you seem to have answered everything. Could you clarify:


Are these addresses what are sometimes called 'public keys' and the signatures 'private keys'?


Does this mean the previously private keys are now publisized?

This is lazy. The killer application of btc is lowered transaction costs, especially for international exchange, but he does not see it. This is not exactly a secret.
I think he is mislead by 'mining', which is only a metaphor. What they are doing in Iceland is 'accounting', which does not make as vivid a metaphor.
