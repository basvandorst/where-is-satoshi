By the way. Other people encountered these scammers too. This is a post by someone else and this is supposedly after they finally hired more tech support:

Really? Do you guys actually have someone competent enough to look at the receiving address and recognize it is one of yours? And can you refund in bitcoin?
Also nice of you to define this as "falling through a crack". It was consistent support request for a few months. The only way it can fall through the crack is if you guys actively ignored it.

Just a reminder. This app is a scam. It lets you buy small amounts the first few times. Then when you deposit a larger amount, they claim that they didn't receive the transaction. Even after posting the transaction ID to their support. Nothing was heard.
Oh yea, I got a support email 3 years later asking about the ticket I submitted for 10% of the value that I lost. Then to add insult to injury, they try to refund it in fiat instead of the bitcoin that was lost.

Got scammed for $50 from them before. Tech support ticket took 3 years to reply.  They were a scam, but might've been legitimate now as btc price increased by a lot to get them out of their previous dilemmna. I'd just recommend to never load more than $10 at any time.
Personally would not touch again as $50 3 years ago is worth a lot more than the worthless fiat they are trying to refund me now. And I suspect I only got a reply after I posted my experience twice on reddit when they try to promote themselves.
