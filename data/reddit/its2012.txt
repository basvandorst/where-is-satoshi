Go to Bitfloor and you can deposit cash at your local Bank of America. You can deposit USD into your Bitfloor account really quickly. You don't need an account there to do it, either.
Well, quick by our standards. It can take up to 24 hrs or as little as 30 minutes.
The company managing the deposits does take a fee of 1-4%, but in some cases it might be worth it to save the time and the hassle. Plus, Bitfloor is a good exchange and prices seem to be more stable there (again, stable by our standards).

Why would anyone go to jail. As far as I know, nothing illegal happened, it's just that there was too much hype around it and it was overvalued.

Well either way, the $100 I was going to spend wouldn't be that big of a loss even if they became worthless.
I really just didn't have a method of paying for them at the time. Otherwise, I would've had no problem buying them. :(

This is the greatest comment ever made in It would be even better out of context.
@_date: 2013-04-03 07:57:24
I still haven't bought any.
@_date: 2013-04-04 04:26:12
It's funny that the last time I looked at this transaction it said about $4M, now it says $4.5M.

Lol. "Hey, we're need to rent your botnet so we can crash the price of Bitcoins. Do you accept Bitcoins?"
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:05:37
Annnnnd Bitfloor is down...
@_date: 2013-04-24 09:24:37
Why would any company do that?
If that's how they would try to make money, why would they not just buy Bitcoins and wait for the price to go up?
@_date: 2013-04-02 08:40:49
You think that's bad? I desperately wanted to buy Bitcoins when they were about $1 each because I knew they'd go up in price. Unfortunately, I didn't have any way of paying for them. (I am 19 now, was 17 at the time, had no bank account, etc.)
I watched helplessly as they rose in price. I was going to buy 100 of them.
@_date: 2013-04-03 07:33:46
I'm feeling worse and worse about not buying 2 years ago at $1 each.

He should stick to elections, he gets everything else wrong.

And apparently both in Austin.

I will give you $0.14 for it. :-)
@_date: 2013-04-02 23:19:46
I know and I regret not doing it.
@_date: 2013-04-05 10:13:51
Wow. Looks like you spent a lot of time on this comment. I hate to tell you this, but I'm pretty sure he was making a joke.
@_date: 2013-04-05 09:27:37
Which is exactly why steam probably won't accept Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-03 07:48:32
I was so close to doing it. I knew they'd go up. (I thought they would maybe reach $50 each)
@_date: 2013-06-06 19:57:20
I asked him what he thought about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:00:10
I'm still not buying...
@_date: 2013-04-09 06:06:49
I can't believe anyone actually bought into the FB IPO. It was so obviously overvalued. I found out a few of my uncles bought some shares and I just face palmed.
@_date: 2013-04-05 03:59:02
Don't act like it's not a valid question. I'm sure it happens all the time with Bitcoin, but it happens with cash all the time, too.
