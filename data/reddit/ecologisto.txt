Please, no. This has been demonstrated to be a very ineffective method. Sorry to disappoint you as you are a regular donator. I hope that I have time tonight to give you my sources.
EDIT: I think that I was too strong when using the word "demonstrated". There are worries and questions about the project. What a number of organizations and scientists propose is to invest money in preventing the plastic to reach the oceans rather than trying to clean it up afterwards. In the end, maybe we need both but if money is diverted to the the TOCP instead of going to early catch of plastic then it is globally negative.

Europe has anti money laundering laws but none that would prevent a company to communicate with their customers if there is not a formal investigation. Bitstamp is probably doing their due diligence following anti money laundering laws but that would not prevent them telling so to the customer.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:17:30
I don't understand this sentiment. You would not have bought bitcoins if it were not to buy weed, thus either way you would not be rich today.

I would say it doesn't help that we, this community, act and talk often in a very arrogant way and with a lot of hate for anything non-bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-06-02 12:27:44
For some it means that you let more competent people protect your money. And if it is a real bank, your money is insured up to 100000 chf, thus even if they bankrupt or run you get your money back.
@_date: 2015-06-29 09:58:05
I get your point. However, I think that this is more a policy question than a currency problem. In Switzerland I can know where my tax money goes, although we don't use Bitcoin. And a government using Bitcoin could still obfuscate their accounting.

Same thing for your mnemonic poem...

@_date: 2015-06-28 16:32:08
I don't really see what difference it would make for this country. They currently have a currency they can't manipulate (e.g. devaluate) and they would have a currency they can't manipulate either.
Their problem is complex and has many reasons. Euro is one but Bitcoin would not help with that matter.

Well, things are not exactly like you describe. Simon made both technical and managerial mistakes. Huge mistakes.
Days after a major bug was demonstrated, he kept the website open although money was leaking. He had no clue how to develop software but didn't hire a professional despite the big money he was making.
Moreover, the german state was correct to freeze the money. Simon didn't respect the regulations. Fortunately they released it when things were clarified. 
The polish freeze is another story. 
Would Simon have been more thorough, things wouldn't have gone that bad.

Well, it is mandatory to pay taxes and to fill in the forms in an honest way. 
However, government will not automatically check what you say in your forms. You could simply take half the money you earn and put it in your safe box and nobody would know. Yet, given this possibility of fraud, most people declare of their revenue and fortune. I hope it is because trusting people and treating them as adults make them responsible and honest human beings. 
One last thing that also help understand this : we vote on taxes. Thus we feel a bit in control.
@_date: 2014-11-27 08:54:55
I don't remember paying fees to send SEPA to bitstamp, certainly not 15$. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 09:56:34
For the stocks you have to declare the value at the end of the year if I am not wrong. It is needed to calculate the tax on wealth. 
For the revenue, you have to wait until you sell. However, in Switzerland, you would declare it but taxes are 0 on capital gain.
@_date: 2014-06-28 13:08:35

People in this sub seems to forget that having some planification, decision and action at the level of a country is not a bad thing in itself. I think that you make a very good demonstration of it.

What you say is in general true and I like your last sentence. However this one is a bit US biased I would say :


In Switzerland the government has not access to your bank account (if you are not a US citizen). Safe boxes are allowed and no one peers over your shoulder when you use it. Companies do not inform the State how much your earn. (Interestingly, most people still fill in their tax form and pay their share to the community.)

Bitcoin will not solve this type of problem. 
People, today, without Bitcoin, could simply keep cash at home. But they don't. Why ? Because they fear that it gets stolen or lost or burnt or whatnot. 
Having Bitcoin doesn't solve this problem. When Bitcoin goes mainstream there will be banks to keep your bitcoins safe for you. And these banks might, and probably will, act exactly like HSBC today.

The problem in this subreddit is that people believe that the world is just like the US. It is not. 
You have a crappy banking service, I do understand that. But in Europe the services are in general not that bad. Instant transfer and full online banking services are just normal.
Just to be clear, I think that banks are evil in their current incarnation, it is just that you also have to realize that the advantages of Bitcoin over banks are less obvious here in Europe.

Let's not forget that when there were real banking regulations between the thirties and the beginning of Clinton's era, scams were a lot less likely and there were no crashes as massive and frequent as the ones we got since the deregulation.

From my totally subjective point of view, I prefer slightly the trezor ; mostly because of the software. Launching those pesky chrome apps for different coins and selecting the corresponding app on the ledger is clumsy. 
One thing is sure, do not buy a keepkey. They still have not released the BTG and the BCH is in beta...

I live in Switzerland. In all honesty, putting 10000 in my bank account takes 2 minutes of walk to the bank and 1 minute operation at the ATM, and requires zero competence or paper work. The government will ask question if your bank account grows to fast compared with your revenue, that is clear. 10000 will be totally invisible to them though.
Creating a paper wallet though takes a lot of reading and effort. At least this is my experience. 
So my conclusion is that it is a localized advantage. In the USA you apparently need Bitcoin for this.

I have a very limited knowledge on the topic, sorry about that. 
Switzerland used to have a very strong bank secrecy. Under the pressure of the USA we had to drop it. Bank secrecy remains for Swiss inhabitants though. Switzerland still has strong financial, banking and commodities sectors. It also promotes self-responsibility and market freedom and encourages entrepreneurship and privacy. 
ETFs can be approved in Switzerland by the [finma]( I did not find much information on the constraints ([just this, in french]( but it seems a lot lighter than what we saw with the COIN ETF. It requires in particular to have a [market maker]( and not to exceed certain deviation from the underlying index. I can't say if an ETF based on Bitcoin would be compatible as it is not per se an index. 
Something important to keep in mind : Crypto-currencies are well represented here : one can buy Bitcoins at any ticket machine in the train stations which are ubiquitous. Bitcoin has an official value to declare them in your tax form (which would tend to prove that they consider that there is an index !). We have quite a number of companies active in crypto and privacy, for example Ethereum fondation or protonmail.
I hope I could give a bit more information, although I am not an expert.

6 months or a year ago I started hearing people saying that Bitcoin is a store of value and not a currency. It is part of the debate on the block size (on which I don't have a strong opinion). 
Having small blocks means that the fees go up. To which, some people started advocating that any ways Bitcoin is not meant to pay for a coffee or a game on steam and therefore it does not matter. 
This is what I was referring to. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 11:08:55
Apparently Bitcoin is not meant to be used to buy stuff thus all this excitement was vain... Funny how nobody at the time ever said "Bitcoin is not meant to be used for that !".

Nice app. When I click on a currency to get details it is almost immediate but not when I click again to close it. As a result it reopened the details when it finally registered that I closed it and clicked again on it. 
I would like to have separators (like apostrophe or comma depending on your country) in the global market cap : 10'000'000'000 instead of 10000000000. 
Also, a little arrow or something to show the last move of each currency would be nice. If it went up last, then an up arrow.

In an advanced economy that produces few goods and rather provide services, the decrease in the cost of inputs does not compensate for the relative increase in the cost of manpower. 
In this case, devaluating is an attempt at maintaining the level of the exports. 
Moreover, as there is no inflation, despite the devaluation, the money is not stolen from the people savings. 
I agree that some times devaluating is not wise, but in this precise case I do believe that the SNB acted in the interest of the Swiss people and it had a positive impact.

In which country ? In mine, VAT is applied on any purchase. The medium of exchange is irrelevant. Even a transaction not involving money, barter, would still be taxed although it is usually not applied as the tax man is not aware of the transaction.

Interesting. I was not aware of this fight.

Thank you again for this interesting history fact.
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:04:53
If the SNB had not (indirectly) printed large amounts of money, the Swiss economy might have suffered a lot in the 10 past years. It is maybe not ideal but if others are devaluating it is very difficult for an advanced economy to continue exporting while not devaluating. 
I do not believe that "printing" money is good or bad in itself. 
Also, as noted by jsk25, I prefer that the money earned in this process goes to the people rather than the banks.

1. Redistributing wealth is not a bad idea per se. 
2. I did not say that wealth was created. The Swiss economy is very dependent on exports. The relative cost of the Swiss goods went through the roof due to other currencies devaluating. If we had not devaluated, a bit, as well, many more companies would have gone bankrupt in Switzerland. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 18:46:19






I guess that not answering my question and not naming who THEY are is part of a complex complotism at play. I presume that you will now accuse me of either being stupid for adhering to THEIR game or being actually part of THEIR game.

You are wrong, it is a bank. It is licensed by FINMA as a bank and it can hold your funds as such. It offers mortgages as well.

There is a large amount of ignorance and fear by the people in the linked thread. 
This being said, I am not thrilled by how the Bitcoin community will look like to anyone reading this thread. In my opinion it is a missed opportunity. First of all, the fears expressed in the first posts were neither acknowledged nor addressed in a simple, factual and precise way. There is a long post about Bitcoin but that was far far too complicated for a layman. Second and more importantly, the whole brigading just antagonized everyone. We are not going to educate and convince people about Bitcoin this way. 
I know how we feel in such cases, but let's try to keep in mind our main goal (I think) : educate and convince.

yes, indeed. But there is so much money to make that I am sure that there are people with the knowledge and the money who will look into this. When ? not so far in the future I guess. 
It could also be an existing bank that spawns a new one for this purpose. 
I also tried to convince the trading company I use, which is a bank as well, to accept btc trading. They refused. But they would have typically had the lawyers, bank experts and assets to make it.

I can't agree more with you. We should advertise the way Electrum works where you don't back up your wallet, only the random sentence it gives you. It would also simplify the document.
@_date: 2013-12-10 08:08:57
Well, because I trust the judiciary and legal system of Switzerland. I live here, so you might say I am biased. Still, if the company is located here I know that I can sue it and its owners. If it is located almost anywhere else, I wouldn't bet on this. 
As an example, I have seen how the polish prosecutor handled the case of bitcoin-24 and it was just a joke. 
Switzerland allows you to use cash almost without limit. In France you can't even pay something more expensive than 3000 euros in cash ! I take that as a good sign for Bitcoin. 
Lastly, and as reported [here]( the parliament, which is made of regular citizen meeting 3 times a year (i.e. non professional politicians), is making progress toward setting up a fair position toward Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-17 17:33:59
Time is coming for desperate proposals :

2. Hire a detective, find him, hunt him, get him to give our bitcoins back
3. Call all the Hausdorf in Germany until we find someone from his family in order to get to him
4. Hack into his emails, accounts and even servers to know more about him and find him 
Ok, 2. and 4. are not serious, they are illegal. But he would deserve it.

Use Electrum... 
@_date: 2013-12-10 08:20:55
I disagree. I think that your opinion is based on false assumptions about the Swiss political system. 
This guy made a postulate as himself and not for his party. His postulate might have seemed negative but was actually a legitimate request to the government to make a thorough evaluation of a new and disruptive technology. 
Talking about "Socialism" in general without giving context doesn't make sense in my opinion. Chavism and the Swiss socialist party are not the same.

It seems to be a very nice accounting tool.

However, I can't find any mention of Bitcoin ?
What I like is that it shows very clearly that using Bitcoin doesn't mean escaping your citizen responsibilities, i.e. paying your taxes. In Switzerland, the tax declaration is based on trust and Bitcoin doesn't change anything about it.

How do I "support" Namecoin ? 
@_date: 2013-04-26 15:20:11
I go in your direction. Two weeks ago I thought it would be good to stop using MtGox and go for another market to help diminish this single point of failure. Thus I moved some coins and sent some euros to bitcoin-24. The day after it closed. Too bad I didn't continue with the leader.
@_date: 2013-04-28 18:36:24
I think it is a very good and pertinent idea. 
If you are accepted as a bank in Switzerland for example, and you get your full accreditation, the other banks can't refuse to send or receive from your bank accounts. 
The regulation might be quite important, but people have done it in the past. For example the BAS (Banque alternative Suisse). And who knows ? it might be simpler than we think. Simply people all repeat that it is impossible...
I don't think there is another way out of the current situation. The banks will continue to shut down the bank accounts of the exchanges and jeopardize the whole bitcoin economy.

We need a *real* bank, approved by a government in a serious country. This bank should accept and deal in btc although it has to have its accountabiliby in the fiat money of the country where it resides. 
Then our btcs would be as much safe as possible given the context : government ensures the money (up to 100000$ in Switzerland, thus safety from bankrupt), owners are identified and can't easily fly away with the money (safety from scam). 
@_date: 2013-04-18 08:59:51
Simon, 
You keep talking about the bank accounts. 
But why don't you talk about our bitcoins stuck in your wallets ? 
You said you rolled back. Good. 
When can I withdraw my bitcoins ?
All you have to do is 
1. Generate new passwords for all users
2. Build a page to allow people to withdraw btcs to a given address
3. Send an email to all users with the new password and the link to the page to withdraw.
Have you worked on that ? 
@_date: 2013-04-15 20:00:39
Thank you very much Simon for this update. I appreciate it.
1. I am very glad to hear that no money was lost. Does it mean that nobody withdrew duplicated money or that you compensated with your own funds ?
2. Excellent, good job. Thus what prevents you from letting people take their bitcoins out of the web site ?
3. Well, you should really give an estimate, for dollars and bitcoins. Is it a day ? a week ? a month or a year ?

Simon, you are playing a very dangerous game here. 
We are talking a lot of money. We are talking the German Taxation service knocking at your doors. We are talking the police knocking at your door. This is serious as hell. I am not saying it as a threat as I won't call my lawyer (yet), but I am honestly worried for you. You don't seem to realize in what situation you are. Making your customers angry is just the worse thing to do right now. 
This could go very wrong. Not only because of the angry mob that might be assembling in front of your home but more seriously because you are going to end up in jail with civil cases (customers) and penal case (the German Governement) against you.
Now, to try diminishing the overal pain, could you
1. tell us how much money (in btc or $) that was lost due to the buggy engine
2. tell us when you will have finished the roll back of transactions and what will be the policy
3. tell us when we can start withdrawing our money
4. stop talking about your bank accounts problems for a while
5. stop whining about the german governement (you are faulty)
6. give us updates often (at least once per day)
@_date: 2013-06-18 15:29:41
