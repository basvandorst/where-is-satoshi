I wonder if one of the reasons Mike Tyson seems to be so enamored with bitcoin is due to the fact that he was taken advantage of so badly in the past financially from people he was associated with it.

It was fitechnical and alot of the points he brings up sound like really amazing innovations not just recently thought possible. He wasn't spouting off source code, but clearly has a grasp of what he is talking about and delivers it in quite an articlate fashion.

We'll have to see how it all shakes out, but at this point I'm not sure this would prevent segwit from being implemented due to lack of motivated developer, but you're right its not something that you can just hand to someone and tell em to get crackin.

2MB seems like a pretty conservative increase and will serve as a stop gap until the other enhancements like segwit come along. Why is there such contention about this issue if done in a hard fork with concurrence from a growing group of large players?

Why are you like this? It would be great to see the two communities prosper together.  They obviously serve two different use cases.
