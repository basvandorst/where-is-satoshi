Well I pretty much exhausted my knowledge of the US political system with that first sentence so I'll take your word for it. Not entirely convinced that Obama personally orchestrates every single activity undertaken by the executive branch. Ain't nobody got time for that.

Price charts are fractal - you can see the same patterns at almost every scale.
This *could* be the denial, despair and capitulation point. Or it could be the bear trap.
BTC has moved incredibly fast. Just as the dotcom bubble ('new economy'!) went through the boom-bust cycle faster than markets had seen, bitcoin has done it another order of magnitude faster *again*.
It's worth remembering that BTC hasn't hit the mainstream yet. When your barber starts discussing his bitcoin investments and BTC-fuelled retirement plan it will be time to worry.
This sort of rapid price movement is typical of currency markets - the great thing about BTC is that anyone on the internet can be a spot FX dealer.
I don't know if bitcoin will 'stick' as the currency of the internet but I feel like it's a glimpse of the future of money.

It's called 'painting the tape' and it's a form of market manipulation that's illegal in regulated exchanges.

I'd love to see it released as a series of small packages, I played around with implementing BIP38 in Go last week and realised quite quickly that I had some yaks to shave first.

Using a known-but-different salt is fairly common. Eg. password:username or password:email.
The attacker could know the strategy and have access to all the salts and  it would still slow them down.

At this point I would be entirely unsurprised if Satoshi turned out to be a spook or someone/some people with connections to the intelligence community. Possibly a group who got fed up waiting for the public domain to discover an algorithm they've known about for years. (I believe public/private key cryptography was known about in the intelligence community about 20 years before the RSA paper was published).
The success with which Satoshi has remained anonymous (and silent) indicates a better than casual knowledge of secrecy.
I'd go with **mathematician** or **cryptography expert**.

The code avoids the most common source of bugs in C/C++, namely buffer overruns. It makes heavy use of STL and boost. The functions are rather long for my taste which makes it less readable that it might be. But I'm by no means an experienced C programmer.
There were bugs in the first versions of the Satoshi client. Mostly on the networking side, which was hard to test until there were several instances running in the wild. It also suffered from a couple of threading bugs (deadlocks).
Satoshi also didn't enable most of the scripting capabilities documented in the protocol due to concerns about potential security weaknesses being present if it wasn't implemented correctly.
Here's the vulnerabilities list:

Pretty much nothing. Difficulty doesn't go up arbitrarily, it goes up to maintain an average block creation rate of 1 every 10 minutes. It's a trailing indicator correlated to the global hashrate. Hashrate has gone up a lot recently (so blocks were being created slightly faster than the target of 1 every 10 minues), so difficulty increases accordingly.

My bad.
Bid and Ask walls are a *different* way of manipulating the market because they make everyone think that there is a nice safe floor on the price - a floor that will mysteriously vanish if it is approached.

Have an upvote for being so wonderfully gay. "Gay??" You may well ejaculate. I put it to you that language is normative, words mean what the majority of people think they currently mean, not what they may once have meant.

The block reward halves every 4 years or so. That's what I was referring to. The reducing block rewards mean that miners will have to rely on transaction fees to cover their costs, leading to a possible fragmentation where some miners will only accept transactions with fees above a certain amount.
Keeping the block reward constant would solve both the deflation issue due to lost coins and provide a far more straightforward incentive to miners.

Sshhh. It's a secret.

Gold price fluctuation can also be caused by market shocks such as finding a huge deposit (which is unlikely), or a ship full of bullion sinking, taking it out of circulation.
While the first shock can't happen to bitcoin as mining is predictable, bitcoins can be lost, which will push the value of the remaining ones up (expressed as an exchange rate).
My fear is that as the mining rate drops, bitcoins will be lost over time, causing deflation. Maybe I'm worrying about this too soon, as it would mean that BTC has become mainstream, but what happens to someone's bitcoins when they die? With money in a bank it can be passed on as inheritance. If someone dies before passing on their wallet file the coins are gone forever.
Personally I feel that the upper limit was a design mistake. (If this is bitcoin's only design flaw it's still an incredible achievement). If the coin generation rate was fixed at the initial value of 50 then more coins would be generated at a constant rate. Would this be inflationary? Yes it would. Inflation (based purely on monetary growth) this year would be at around 33% based on BTC growth (assuming 50 coins * 10 minutes per block). In year 2019 it would be 11%. By 2024, 7%, trending asymptotically towards zero.
The 'actual' inflation that would be experienced would probably be a lot lower, due to large early wallet losses. Many early adopters mined for a while, probably got several hundred or thousand coins and then got bored and deleted them. In the long term wallets would get lost due to hardware failure and lost keys (including those lost when the wallet holder dies). In a perfect system the coin generation rate would be calculated to offset the 'shrinkage' of the money supply to perfectly balance inflationary and deflationary forces.

But then you'd be missing a golden opportunity to use µBTC which, said aloud, sounds like 'microButtock'. Won't someone think of the µBTCs!

When it comes to language I'm not sure that's even possible. Words mean what we generally agree they mean. Otherwise we're all just frombling up the whally grunthorp.
