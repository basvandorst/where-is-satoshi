Long time Bitcoiner here. Ethereum has taken the Bitcoin idea to a new level of usability. The code that backs bitcoin is hard to work on. Ethereum has designed the whole blockchain concept around programming language. Ethereum is easier to write programs for. It is like programmable money where Bitcoin is just money. Another factor about Ethereum is it is still capable of making difficult decisions. Bitcoin is still locked up in concerns about block size. Ethereum plans to move to POS which will align the interest of those in control of the network to making the hard decisions in order for adaptability to be a component of the network. A difficulty bomb in the code ensures that the move to POS will happen with a degree of believably. It is like forcing the minors in China to finally make a decision that will benefit Bitcoin. Ethereum has built in code to force decisions that need to be made. I hope that helps.

I love how bitcoin has be gaining traffic, value, and stability for the past 7 years despite what people clam. When bitcoin is 10 years old it will pass a critical point of surviving a threshold that only 10% of startups last through. Bitcoin is in fact a startup. But it might become an empire. If this will happen is not known. I don't have the answers anymore than anyone else. But what Bitcoin has accomplished already is quite amazing. The world is forever changed and we have yet to see the implications of its applications. To say Bitcoin does not solve any problems is just plain stupid. For one, it has created consensus that is distributed. This was never accomplished in money before bitcoin.

Absolutely...but it would not work. Why? Because the interests of the few outweigh the interest of the company. So if a company buys all the shares like you said than an individual with this knowledge would be stupid not to buy all of these false cheap shares for himself and make a killing. The truth will prevail because the individual will want to see massive gains on the actual truth.

Bitcoin is a financial asset. As bitcoin grows general financial news will become more and more relevant to it. An individual's opinion about the global financial situation shows validation for one side of a particular argument depending on that individual's previous accomplishments and their relevance to the prediction. If we are facing a financial collapse it will greatly influence Bitcoin and is most defiantly relevant to Bitcoin.

If bitcoin can hold its value it will create trust. Trust is earned. Those who buy bitcoin to hold it are the people who are taking risk today in hopes that others will also learn to trust bitcoin. If others learn to trust it AND if it proves their trust as valid then those who were greedy and hording will become rich. When they become rich their greed will push them to buy things outside of bitcoin to secure their new wealth by distributing their assets to other areas such as tangible goods that have proven trust unlike the system of bitcoin which is earning its trust. I think that the 1000 spike was necessary as no one would be paying attention to bitcoin if it did not show people the potential of making people rich. Why learn a new system? Only because it has the potential to make people rich does it tempt people to actually figure it out.

The reason these kinds of things get posted in Bitcoin should be obvious to most people. Bitcoin is a currency that competes with traditional state issued currencies. It does not do that today but in the future it will. Bitcoin is owned by the users because it is open sourced. Government issued currency is owned by those who have the ability to control the supply. The value of currency is dependent how it's masters control it. So what will be the value of the Euro? What will be the value of the Dollar? What will be the value of Bitcoin? That is the reason these posts are here.

But at least I can admit that the possibility exists that I could be wrong. I feel sorry for those who can't do that.

"I could be wrong" means I could be wrong. At least I am not so sure of myself as you are. I have dedicated the time into understanding what bitcoin is and made the best decision after that point.

Once the price finds a floor I think it will take off after that. To me it looks like it has found that floor at around 300. Heck it could go past that and if it does I'm sure it would see another dip. But as I read a long time ago, as long as bitcoin has any value it serves its function as a means to transmit value seamlessly. Given that knowledge, I don't care what the price is today...it will succeed in growing users (and will thus become more scarce in the market).

Great presentation. I like how you placed emphasis on the autonomous actors. This is the argument that won me over to bitcoin when I was first thinking about its uses. Another way I see bitcoin is like the invention of a financial instrument. Just like the invention of equity I see bitcoin as an invention of ownership association without third party validation. Software will do the validation. The financial world is going to completely change soon. I have not doubted bitcoin since I first herd of if back in 2012. In 2012 and 2013 we where the crazy ones. I think we are not going to be the crazy ones any more!

I have been involved with bitcoin since 2010 and the whole time the conversation has been around "omg bitcoin is going to moon" to bitcoin is dead" to "bitcoin far from ready". I have been using it as it develops and I can say that it is defiantly getting better and more convenient to use. The conversation goes to the type of conversations it is in now when bitcoin subsides from media attention over stretches of time between its bubbles. The next stage in the conversation will be about how bitcoin will hit a million some day as greed will take over again. Bitcoin is an interesting cycle to watch. So in summary "bitcoin is very good" was the bubble and now "bitcoin will improve" is stagnation. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 11:25:41

@_date: 2014-02-12 16:03:53
The purpose of bitcoin was not to replace those entities exclusively.  One of the purposes, or so I assume from Satoshi's paper, is that double spending is removed. Having trust in a third party is not removed from local block chains. This means that you will have to trust a third party to buy a cup of coffee. But if you want to send decent amounts of money over the web you will not have to use third parties. So if bitcoin uses localized block chains it will be a hybrid system of trust. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 21:28:23
It makes perfect sense currently. Look at the past year. All downward, yet the news all year has been good for bitcoin. The rate of decline has slowed as well. For an investor this is the time to buy. When everything logical about it is positive and when everything market about it is negative. The emotions of the market are that bitcoin is a failure. 2014 worst investment ever. That is because opportunities only last in short spurts. Those who can see they are coming are the ones that can take advantage of them. I could be completely wrong. But the fundamentals of bitcoin have not changed...only the emotional sentiment. It makes sense to buy now more than ever.

I honestly think we will see bitcoin hit 8000 in the next run up and 20,000 over all in the coming years as it becomes a convenient international debit card service. (Especially useful around airports) This places a market cap of around four hundred billion which is about the size of some of the companies bitcoin aims to displace. 
What remains to be seen is if Bitcoin will ever be worth more than that. It would need to be backed by someone in order to see higher prices than those stated. I am not sure how long that will take or if it will at all. But my gut tells me that Bitcoin is the best investment opportunity in the history of mankind simply because it is a new financial invention that will change everything about modern finance. 
Call me crazy, but I believe this is a black swan paradigm exploding meteorite that will change everything, regardless of price.

I think bitcoin will go down to probably to 125. This is a wild guess. Could be lower. I also think there are more hype cycles left for Bitcoin. Right now employment is getting better and the financial world seems to have no big news. Ok then so the reason Bitcoin was born seems to be fading away in the back of everyone's mind. But those things are still there. The things that caused the financial meltdown are still there. When they boil to the surface again, whenever that is, Bitcoin will be in the far back of peoples mind. When people see it reach some base level and actually stay there (the basement price does not matter) that is when the next bubble will be. Base level is when the down ward trend is over and the very slow up tick settles in. Slow up tick over time then sudden rush in is the bubble cycle. So I think basement level is going to be reached soon. I base this on the boredom people get out of Bitcoin. They will get bored and leave. The perfect environment for the market to actually use Bitcoin for its demand purposes. Bitcoin does have demand that will not change: Transferring money globally, dark markets, and protection against fiat. Also, demand will increase as more people use it because new business opportunities will exist such as peer to peer network apps.

Bitcoin's success is a better means of limiting the power of government than any such idea as this. 
I am not a libertarian. But because gov does not represent our interests it is better to limit its power to nothing. Government does ~~nothing for us.~~ only what it needs to to preserve the interests of those who make up the rules. Whether our interests are represented is a side to this factor.

Interesting word usage. I never used the word Pedantic before. I am sure you are absolutely right. My point being that they don't issue currency in our favor but they issue it in theirs. Their interests might be that of order. Which would mean I would share their interests.

It is Bitcoin in general that made me understand the whole concept of money. I never investigated or knew what was going on before. Now that I do I am absolutely abolished that citizens passively stand by as the most important aspect of government is run by people who represent the interests of boarders rather than the wealth of citizens. 
Consider this, inflation is at 2%. So 2% of all wealth immediately goes to people who have a title and nothing more. They add nothing to the system. In addition to that they get first person advantage of receiving that money before it hits velocity. That means they can make loans with it or buy things at a significant advantage to the rest of us. 
Summary: Its gross and stupid and outdated for governments to control money supply.

If bitcoin gets an upward trend then it will go much higher than 600$. However that is a big 'if'. I believe that even if it finds an equilibrium for a period of time (like a few months?), spelling out the end to downward trends, then it will get a massive positive boost.

Legal tender for some country. Does not have to be a big one. But once some nation makes it legal as a means to pay tax and legal representation of ownership of property (color coins) then the whole nation will become a smooth operator with the protocol. If this happens it will be what drives bitcoin to very high levels compared to today benefiting that nation significantly. This is a big if, and Bitcoin has to prove itself as a high frequency operator before it can reach that if.

Governments will simply not allow themselves to lose this power. That is the point he makes. I have to disagree, because governments are made of greedy politicians.

I wish Bitcoin would become like a real currency. But it has a major threat in that all transactions can be locked up if it does not reach the 950 mark by the halving (double 450ish).

You can clearly see that he does not know what Bitcoin is. To say that we already have a digital money is wrong. We never had digital money like Bitcoin. Credit cards use ledgers that exist between banks. When you make a transaction the money within the bank is electronically moved from one account to another between banks. Bitcoin is an autonomous account that exists outside of banks. You do not need to be a person to have an account with Bitcoin. You do not need to have personal information to have a Bitcoin account. Your account is international vs banks that are local.  When a transaction is completed the transfer of money is done from individual to individual. This is not comparable to credit cards as Mr. Krugman has eluded. He is dismissing it without understanding it which highlights his intellectual honesty to be absent.

My concern with pure capitalistic markets is that they would lead to excessive monopolies that would reach their power into the market and ensure that it was not subject to possible competition thus killing the capitalistic market. Any government that would make its objective to limit that monopoly would inevitably become a market factor and would become just another aspect of the market (law to the highest bidder). It seems to me that given the inherent behavior of humans it is impossible to make utopia unless scarcity in itself is solved. What needs to be the case would be high reward for action that leads to the betterment of all people. Such a system can't possibly be purely capitalistic as the mentioned fear above as well as the natural human ability to put those of low personal exposure out of mind when making decisions such as how to cheaply remove waist products. I think it is impossible to bring about paradise for people unless we change the actual behavior that makes us human. The way to make a better world is to mandate the highest degree of empathy, but who's? So yea. I rambled a little but am curious if you think I am right.

If something grows consistently for one human lifespan then by the account of the human investing in the investment the investment held sustained growth. Nothing makes any sense if you do not set limitations to claims. The statement "life goes on" would be right and wrong at the same time. Until we defined the parameters that the statement encompasses. Such as, life goes on for human kind from 2000 to 2015. Bitcoin's price is sustainable from the year 2008 to when it experiences the peak situation that makes it reach the highest price it will ever reach for goods.

Chart to back your point: 
@_date: 2015-04-29 11:17:14
Velocity is the nature for money to move through an economy. It is the rate that people spend. Economist show velocity as the feeling that if I spend this dollar today it is the belief that I will be able to earn it back in the future. In other words it is 'the comfort level of the market to spend money'. As velocity goes down the belief that one will be able to earn money goes down. It means the market does not believe it will have earning ability in the future and is thus saving for a rainy day. The government prints money in an attempt to make cash more freely available so to counter this mind set. But I am pretty convinced that they have no clue as to what they are doing anymore as they gave all that printed money to banks who did not lend it to the public because the banks know they can't make money from that money ether. You are watching a circus performance where the politicians forgot how dangerous their jobs are and are ignoring the lions that surround them. The show will come to an end and the crowds as well as the performers will run as the show falls apart in disaster. That is unless someone actually does something about this like giving money to those who actually need it. But that will not happen.

I like the webpage. I also like that you are offering money to check you out, because that works for me! ;) I also like that you link to Bitcoinity for your chart. I always liked whoever runs that site. I also like that you show how many customers you have served. 


I guess I personally do not need more than one exchange at the moment. If you have a cell phone app that would be cool. Cell phone wallets are what I am mostly interested in now. Ones that support paper wallets (deposits from paper) as well as other cold storage options are what I like. Those that are the safest and easiest to use are preferable.

That is not true at all. When it loses value relative to other currencies it means that goods and services need more of them to equate their value (because those goods and services remain constant in the short term barring sudden supply chain cuts). As an american I can go to an European country and buy more today than yesterday. This means I earn more for my hourly wage in European countries. Europeans are losing value in their wages and savings.

I think you are right on both of your statements. Dollars to goods ratio is something I should consider when looking at dollars in circulation.

The dollars to goods ratio might be stationary in which dollars would hold current purchasing power. My over simplified question was over simplified. lol

The growth of human population is exactly like that of a spreading mold. But because these two are very similar does not mean they are so. The planet can be lost if humans grow like they did on Easter island. I have many friends in the field of science and politics giving an effort trying to build a sustainable world. I believe it can be done. If it could not then I would find myself agreeing to you that humans have no chance and that the old should die for the young. However if human life can learn to live in systems that are sustainable then the existence of human life is realized to be valuable. The human mind is capable of anything it sets its mind to. I have faith in humanity and this is why I identify somewhat as a humanist. Every action I take is for your personal well being and that of others and my own. Without each other working for a better world nothing matters. You may be right, I may be right, or we both may be. It depends on the context of goals and vision. What would you say is the best goals for human kind?

You do realize that 'stopping everything' would be something that would lead to mass genocide of urban populations. That would be the highest educated part of society as well and it would bring total destruction to all research projects. Because resources like farming produce would stop flowing this would probably cause 90% of the population to die. After that things would return to the way they where 200,000 years ago when the average life expectancy was less than 30. Humans had about 8 children and all but two died. We would be like animals again and the earth would not be affected by us. I say "we" but in reality most likely me and you would die in this scenario. We would be in no position to clean our mess, only nature would clean it up for us. Look around you, I know it is not perfect. But do you really think that all the people around deserve to die so that your idea of fixing the planet can come to be?

What about an attack on the blockchain? Isn't it possible for a group of greedy miners to form a longer fork on the block chain then is currently accepted as the current strand? This would reverse transactions right? 
Is it possible to change the protocol in order to remover this weakness? 
What happens when the rewards go down for minors? Will transaction time become longer? What if the world adapts bitcoin, with trillions of transactions per year, will the system be able to do this?

What is really important here is that you have a plan as to what you want to accomplish. I mean this outside the context of your investments. If you have goals in life it does not matter how your investments perform, you will know what you are working for. Bitcoin is an experiment and we do not know what it will do.

85 to 95 change is 200 billion so that is rate of change of 20
95 to 2002 change is 200 billion so rate of change of 28
02 to 07 is rate of change of 28
07 to 12 is about 33
12 to 14.5 is about 80
The rate of change is increasing. 
Obviously this is a curve and the rate of change in the end is speeding up. 
It does not follow a perfect curve because the information is from the real world. How can you not see this is an exponential curve?

Set goals you want to obtain in life. Break down the steps to achieve them in small manageable steps. Your investments are not your life. They are the best logical guess you have about the future.

I am not afraid of death at all. When I die I will not exist. How can I fear that of which I have no part? However my mental active state naturally wants to preserve itself. Not at the cost of others. However I do believe we will all die, even if immortality is accomplished. After all, the version of myself that was 12 died when I turned 13. I am not the same person I was then, I do carry some of his memories. But he died. This kind of death I welcome. However I do love life. I want my life force to move into what I believe will be one consciousness. Long in the future all minds will merge together and we will be one.  That is the point I am aiming for. You can see from my perspective that I have no desire to rape the planet, only to make it to the eternal upload. Because we will figure out how to upload our minds into other matter. No need for much physical space then, heck human kind can be reduced to a cube and ejected off the planet all together at this point. 
On a further note, our language is arbitrary and the meanings we express are no means absolutes. So if I say one thing it can be right, wrong and both at the same time. I know you want a paradigm shift and so you are smart enough to realize that perspectives are the realities that humans hold. They have no meaning of what actually is. But they are the world for those that hold perspectives. Knowing this allows you to realize your mental model is right and wrong at the same time. If everyone knew this we would have much more understanding.

I think it is hard to value bitcoin as just a form of currency. It also is a form of equity in the sense that you buy a share of the transaction platform. With this in mind you can view it as part of a start up. The bitcoin company is its development team and the businesses that accept it. Bitcoin is even forming its own sales force. Looking at it this way bitcoin generates a profit in the form of transactions that rewards those who hold up the network.
 So my evaluation is +currency function (scarcity and holding value) +equity function (the business network of those who use it) + (future growth (business network potential to grow) + new applications) minus (-) possible code error and (-) possible attack on system (-) pending protocol upgrades. Bitcoin will be worth a very high number because not only is it a form of currency, it is also a share value of an autonomous company.

@_date: 2013-11-25 04:45:08
I understand your argument. But put it this way. We have an economy of four entities. A, B, C, and D. A is the money supplier. B, C and D trade with each other their goods and services with the currency that is in circulation. B,C and, D depend on each other to make a profit so that what they spend money on can make a profit and sell it to the others. When A changes the money supply (because they have infinite money) they do so by buying products from one of these market players. This drives prices up. (Toxic asset purchases inflating real estate prices). The rent is too damn high! lol They cause competition with those who have legitimate operations to shut down because they cannot compete with someone who has infinite wealth. This shuts down GDP and productivity. Easy money is terrible for productivity. Real value exchange means the real exchange of goods and services. People can only buy what is worth buying, no more bailouts. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 13:54:11
Value is in the context of objectives. So as you said, Facebook has no real value except when used by a sexually driven, highly social species. So the same logic goes for bitcoin. It meets objectives as it allows for international transfer and more freedom over one's finances. For the first time in history wealth has no borders. I can memorize an account and take it with me through any airport. Billions if I desired. This has never been possible before. So bitcoin fits a human objective of gaining more power over one's own money.

The reason wealth disparity hurts us today is because politicians get bought off and make laws for the rich. If bitcoins take over the power of the government will be greatly reduced. The rich will stay the same and so over all it looks a little better I would guess. Technology is reducing barrier to entry for competition in markets and so the greatest factor in slowing progress is government right now. The rich can stop innovation by buying competitors but they cannot do it forever and from many different angles as law can. So I see the reduction of political power as a major benefit. Over all negative effects of wealth disparity reduced. 
**TLDR:** Laws bought by rich major factor of negative effects of wealth disparity. Laws have less effect because government is weaker (much less control over monetary supply). Less negative effects of wealth disparity.

He is both right and wrong. Society will benefit as a whole even though some will see their cash savings drop in value over night. (Which every time bitcoin rises all paper money is losing value quickly).   
Even those people who lose their cash savings will live in a better world than today, I believe bitcoin will make the world a better place for many reasons.

Any paper wallet should have the private key hidden. If a new person to bitcoin showed someone this and they took a picture with their phone they could rob the account.

I love to read counter arguments.I want to be right and so the most valuable thing I can do is to read about its problems. Bitcoin is not perfect, but it is close to it! I still think bitcoin is undervalued. Google is a company based on its network effect. Each share at Google is worth over a thousand and its market cap is well above three hundred billion. Bitcoin is no different in its network effect benefits. The more the price rises the more it makes news. The more it makes the news the more it gets free advertising. The more people who simply know what is is the more likely a small percentage buys a little here and there with the hopes it will grow. Then the people who where early investors find themselves having significantly more wealth. They end up buying more things with their bitcoin power and some of them even enhance there wealth by getting in with bitcoin businesses. They have the equity now to start pushing for platforms that make this new technology easier to use. Soon there will be platforms for other forms of exchange through ledgers off of the bitcoin protocol.  Bitcoin is an autonomous payment company and everyone who works with it represents it. It will succeed, and if it does not I assure you that a derivative technology will succeed. We are watching the transition to a new more efficient era of digital financial instruments. I love to read counter arguments because they are true and valid and so have a weight on what ends up being the conclusion in my mind. I think bitcoin is undervalued, especially in the long.

How about an open sourced government where the laws on the books and the stated territory are chosen by the people in a software run by the people. Several open source governments could be competing for citizens. The people can choose to register as part of the laws of whatever nation they choose paying taxes and receiving social benefits. These countries could compete for citizens by having no laws forbidding citizens from leaving or coming.

It may sound over the top. You and I grew up in a world where our parents used cash for everything and their parents did the same. Our use of printed money is habitual, left behind from when paper notes actually had redeemable value. Paper money has no redeemable value today. We pay taxes in paper so its much like having a king over your head demanding that you use his paper only. He produces the paper and he can make as much as he wants. You have to figure out how to acquire that paper in order to survive.

Money is unit of account. Its main function is to be scarce and where no one can make more of it freely. Money is an agreement system and nothing more. The speed that money is spent is called velocity and shows how much that money is integrated into an economy or how well the economy is functioning. Hording is a sign of a few things in economic terms, but bitcoin is in mass growth so the traditional rules do not apply until bitcoin is adequately adopted. You would be right, if bitcoin was the global currency then hording would be a bad sign. But this is an exception because bitcoin is not yet a widely adopted currency, although that is changing quickly.

New found wealth means new found spending. People spend money based on how much of it they have. The rich make sure they only spend low percentages of what they own. The rest is for investment purposes. This wealth transfer will cause the newly found rich to spend on other investments to lock in positions. Transitions of wealth are sometimes good for economic activity.

I love reading the opposing views. It validates my position to make sure I understand what is being said in opposition to what my brain constructs to be true. I know I can be wrong. By reading counter arguments I reduce the risk of being wrong. You and I benefit because we are not attached to our views but attached to being right, which is a hard thing to do.

If you are loosing it you should consider finding it. lol 
Bitcoin has nothing to do with the stock market yet. Its too small to be considered a player. 
When bitcoin becomes a player, it will be a force in who wins and who fails. 
Whomever can see what this new trend represents will be able to take advantage of it.Who ever does not will lose out.
 For instance a company that will fail will be one that only takes one form of currency and ignores the bitcoin trend. Its debt on its books will remain the same and so it will allocate resources incorrectly. Bitcoin changes the way debt should be held. For instance today, if bitcoin will be successful, then one should take out USD loans for the purchase of good beyond what they would actually need. This because given what will happen in the next few years is that the debt they owe back will lose its value compared to whatever asset they buy. The dollar is going to inflate massively over the next few years. Companies that can see this will win out.  If you can't see that then you do not believe bitcoin will be successful. That is a valid position. We do not know yet if bitcoin is the winner for the new world currency. However it looks very strong like it is that exactly.

The earth if finite, but the universe is not. Mankind can go to the stars if we need more room. There is no such thing as scarcity other than the scarcity we allow to exist through our collective mismanagement. There is practically an unlimited amount of water, energy, land, organic compounds, ect in the solar system. When we go to space every human life will be seen as valuable because we as a species will realize how rare and beautiful we really are compared to the mass vastness that is space.

The nature of bitcoin is beneficial to the states as well. Do not forget that bitcoin is ledger and records all transactions, something the state loves to hear. This will allow for the state to properly gauge taxation of money flow. They may lose the ability to print money, but they gain the ability to know arrogate transact-ability, they even can literally look at the richest people alive and see what they are doing with there money.

Lets keep our heads and not make enemies? I do not like it when the crowd has it's witch hunts. If these guys work against bitcoin, make it not profitable to do so. The miners have the vote in what bitcoin will do and the merchants have control over what they will accept. If no one honors this 'tinted' money then their efforts will be in vain.

85 to 95 change is 200 billion so that is rate of change of 20
95 to 2002 change is 200 billion so rate of change of 28
02 to 07 is rate of change of 28
07 to 12 is about 33
12 to 14.5 is about 80
The rate of change is increasing. 
Obviously this is a curve and the rate of change in the end is speeding up. 
It does not follow a perfect curve because the information is from the real world. How can you not see this is an exponential curve?

There are two philosophies here. One is that bitcoins price surges are bad and the other is that they are good. But it does not matter because bitcoin is going to do what the economic forces sets up bitcoin to do regardless of what we believe.
