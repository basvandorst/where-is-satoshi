Well it started the year at about 800- 900. So incase of another bear market like 2014 i would say 1500 to 3k is the bottom 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:47:51
Well it started the month at 8k so you're into fked if u bought the top at 20k or bought into with your life savings or mortgage.

Really, who the fuck buys 1 dollar of btc 
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:18:39
Rest In piece any1 who bought at 18k on gdax 
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:21:18
Lol what correction it's up 50 % since last week 
@_date: 2018-08-11 17:28:31
bought some random shitcoin a very poor investment indeed 
@_date: 2018-06-11 09:03:46
I know plenty of people with 102k 
@_date: 2018-06-25 13:05:11
Bitstamp 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:17:14
Because that 170k backlog is finally reducing. And some ppl might be dumping now that there transactions are going through 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:25:17
Holy fuck just woke up to this 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:13:00
I'd buy some just for the gamble of it. 
But if one chain dies then it will spook a lot of people out of crypto. Could even be bigger gox
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:01:01
Yes easiest way to take all that money out of the country 
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:58:09
Can't really call it a correction when your still up 700%
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:52:05
I think the fact that people are taking out loans is the biggest sign that we are in a bubble. And if it does crash and people start losing their homes over wel probably see another 1 year bear market 
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:47:00
Crypto survived the 1400 to 150$ craah. It will survive the next one when it happens 
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:40:26
If they do another hardfork I'm ditching some of my ether for bitcoin. Can't keep bailing out people. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:16:49
Well he could also sell 120 mil bitcoins and crash the price 
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:41:48
With the current mempool it's more like a forced hodl. Ironically that also helped stave off the panic that was going on in the early hours. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:03:12
The thing is that bch could repalce. It's not impossible nothing is. But if it does replace it and the original chain dies. Theq losses and uncertainty will create a shitstorm bigger the gox 
@_date: 2018-02-13 08:33:02
U do realize that u can store your btc on your own keys. There's no need to leave it on an exchange.
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:09:20
Dunno bout a 1000, but most likely they will go after mining operations next which could result in a massive crash
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:58:10
Damm, but it's exactly decisions like these that are the most obvious signs of a bubble. 
And If it cashes below 2k then I think theres gonna be a long wait(8 14 months) for a recovery 
@_date: 2017-09-20 09:16:27
It's a bit difficult to compare alcohol prohibition to the potential threat of bitcoin to the status quo 
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:17:26
Yes but if they truly want to damage bitcoin they will simply keep this drip of negative news coming every few days

Think there's gonna be a steady drip of negative news coming out every few days until the end of the month
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:26:28
Definitely invest at least some portion of your portfolio into iota.

Really India hasn't been able to solve it's black economy problem for the last 30 years wtf can they do about bitcoin. How do they expect to  find who controls what private adress 
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:54:18
If today they steal from me, tommoro they steal from you.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:52:45
Worst part is that people don't realize India probably has daily volumes of less than 3500 btc. It really has no impact on the global markets.
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:28:29
Even if something does displace bitcoin as currency. Its first mover advantage and the communities faith in it means that it is gold 2.0 at the least.
@_date: 2017-09-16 09:39:46
I think people are pricing in that the delay is to give the govt some time to introduce some form of licensing (unlikely in imo)
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:23:34
A bear market will come at some point irrespective  of the fork. I really believe bitcoin will probably reach 50k plus after 4 -5 few years but the growth needs to be sustainable in the long run 
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:57:17
A state backed crypto is essentially prisim on the blockchain.

Don't worry I just sacrificed a goat to satan today. ATH incoming 
@_date: 2018-07-05 20:32:58
Say you got hacked 
@_date: 2018-07-05 20:23:34
WHAT IS THIS BITCOIN? WHAT DO YOU MEAN I CAN’T EAT IT!?!? STOP MAKING IT THEN!
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:46:07
Atleast u didn't buy on credit or mortgage your house or your sell your wife.
