Right, of course you're always gonna be at risk of losing an investment if you invest in it because it could lose value. Furthermore, your risk will be proportional to the amount of $ you invest. 
Still, we invest because we expect the value of the investment to increase long-term.
Cost averaging is nothing radically different, you are simply spreading out the risk exposure over time, taking affordable bite size chunks every week/month.

Breadwallet is a massive step up from an online exchange, but hardware wallet is the best option

I do, because I can't afford $100,000 hospital bills.
The point I was trying to make is that, if you have a bunch of excess fiat lying around (above an emergency fund, other necessities, etc.) and you can afford it, then it's gonna give a higher expected return with higher risk to pursue the lump-sum strategy than to hold on to a portion of that fiat for weeks and months to pursue a DCA strategy.
Obviously, nobody should spend fiat on bitcoin that they cannot afford. This is where DCA comes in. If you can only buy $100/month of bitcoin because you don't make much USD, then go ahead and DCA.
DCA isn't some magical strategy that makes more money because you're getting the bitcoins at a "lower average price"; that only happens if bitcoins dip substantially at the right times.
Rather, dollar cost averaging is a way of sacrificing expected returns in order to assume lower risk.

No more secure than paper wallet, just more convenient/nice features
