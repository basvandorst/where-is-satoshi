Yeah, the charts! The charts! Let's use Homma Munehisa' C18th old-school principles to predict a completely new market nobody has seen before. Let's be honest, he might as well use zodiac charts, tarot cards or tea leaves because nobody really knows where this will go. 
Have fun, make a few bob, enjoy the ride, don't risk what you can't afford to lose, and always wipe front to back.

Batteries need huge amounts of rare minerals and chemicals to manufacture. A Simpler solution has been in action for decades in Wales: 
Not the most efficient way of storing electricity but it's simple to construct, quick to react and can bring on 2GW of power in 90 seconds

Anyone "telling" you to do anything with your money should be laughed out of town. I'll tell you to buy some magic beans in the hope of growing a massive beanstalk.
Seriously, swings of +/-30% should be expected in the unregulated, whale pumped, controlled world of crypto
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:05:36
Nope, electricity should always be produced at a surplus to demand or you will end up with blackouts because no power plant can wind up or down quick enough to match demand fluctuations. Good power control systems are the ones that can operate without affecting the users at the lowest waste margins (highest efficiency).
You can't turn a waterfall, the sun, wind or nuclear power up or down, you can have either on, or off.

When someone asks what Bitcoins are backed by, I ask what the Pound sterling is backed by, or what the US dollar is backed by.
By 'backed', most people mean 'controlled'. Pounds and dollars are backed by intangible concepts like faith, debt and economy but they are controlled by governments, banks and mints printing more or less of them to keep their economy in check through inflation and interest rates. 
If the inflation rate in the value of BTC is in the thousands of %, so be it, that's what it's worth this year compared to last year. A mathematical formula governs how many BTC's there will be in existence at any one time, the consensus governs how much each one is worth. On the downside, the lack of control allows manipulation by whales for their financial own gains, eventually the big financial institutions will end up controlling the price with complete impunity, not consensus. If someone wanted to dump the price to the floor on the day you want to pull your money out too, you're stuffed. 
There are massive upsides but always be aware of the potential risks, Bitcoin can be a double edged sword.

Maybe you don't pay for 'things' with it. Not like people buy houses or a bag of chips with a lump of gold, a government bond or a company share.
You invest in something to store wealth, protect against inflation, make a bit of money on the side, but you always convert your investments back into fiat currency to buy things.

Very true, projects like Everex, building on the ERC20 blockchain are developing a remittance service to overcome this problem.

Chance of BTC being worth 0? Almost 0. 
Chance of you losing 50%? Pretty good depending on your timescale.

You could be right, this could be a very long dip. Then again, it might not be. You think any one of us can predict the future? People can point to patterns, the past, news ... truth is, everyone is guessing.
The question is what you're going to do, buy, sell or hodl?

There's nothing to be worried about. Once upon a time, people kept ledgers in their heads of who owed who what, but it was open to abuse and people fiddled the system, so banks and people started writing things down in big paper ledgers, but that also allowed people to doctor the ledgers and rip pages out and peopel fiddled the system. Then banks moved to computerised databases, but that opened up hacks, insiders changing databases and people fiddled the system. Now they're moving to a blockchain, without enough computers, they'll be susceptible to a 51% attack, without ensuring the right data is entered, people will fiddle the system. 
Banks will always be a centralised system with a centralised ledger and a centralised point of control and a centralised point of failure. When everyone becomes their own bank and we shun the centralised system, that's when things will get interesting. 
To me, this is just a logical and predictable step in the method of ledger keeping, nothing to be worried about.

It aggregates mining power to where electricity is cheapest because it takes a lot of electricity to generate a small amount of value. Cheap electricity comes from having a surplus you can't sell, which will end up going to waste through a power station's cooling system. 
Mining power will be concentrated in places like nuclear power stations with a design horizon well over a decade away, currently running way below capacity at a very low efficiency. Mining helps use up the electrical capacity that would otherwise be lost to create value to economies that can easily be transmitted around the world quickly and cheaply. 
Once the cities grow and need this electrical capacity, electricity companies will increase prices, mining becomes unprofitable and miners move their equipment to the next under-utilised power project with cheap electric. IMO, mining doesn't have anywhere near the effect on the environment that certain agendas want us to believe by quoting an overall power figure and comparing it to a country like Iceland. IMO, mining gems/ precious metals and christmas lights are a far bigger waste of natural resources than Bitcoin. Also, IMO, the biggest problem with the planet faces is the exponential increase in population - owning children is a bigger polluter than owning Bitcoin.

Exactly, not gold, silver, oil, property, nothing you can lay your hands on. It's based on the trust in the economic system it is used in. Exactly the same as crypto currency being backed by the people's faith in the system it is used in. 
You can't use it for paying taxes but that's not what it was designed for. It impossible for a music fan in the UK to pay directly in GBP to a band in Singapore without places like Apple, Sony Music, foreign exchanges, banks and governments all taking their cut. How do you pay in fractions of a penny for an internet advert click? If someone in the western world wanted to loan a farmer in 
a village in Bangladesh money to buy next year's crop seed. The ability to shift millions round the world through various borders to help a humanitarian crisis in Yemen or Myanmar.

Keep going with your logic, what's the next step? What is the US military is backed by? The US dollar. Remember what happened in Zimbabwe last year? if you don't pay your military, they turn on the government.

Why the obsession with having to be backed by something? The dollar, euro, British pound, most currencies we trust aren't backed by anything other than trust in the system. 
I don't trust fiat currencies as a long term store of value because centralised banking systems can conjure up billions of these currencies at the push of a button, out of thin air, they don't have to buy more gold to back that currency, they just create it to control inflation or stimulate economies. Basically, to manipulate the value of the currency. Unlike Bitcoin, the rate of production is predictable and governed by mathematics, transactions are immutable and uncensorable, trust is decentralised.
