Thanks! :)

Just to clarify: We are a proper Hackathon, where you actually build stuff, and you are free to use whatever tech you want.
We are not affiliated nor sponsored with IBM, the comment below has nothing to do with our hackathon.

&lt;3 That's actually something they should do!

Hey, yes, just after it. 8th to 10th, at The Block.
[blockchain-hackathon.com]( for more info :)

I have no idea when they added this, but anyways. I was going to their website today as they are sponsoring the hackathon I'm organizing in 2 weeks in Lisbon. I can recommend them for Bitcoin related questions as I've been using them for a while for different projects.

Here you go, "Reddit" is now a discount code for the next 5 days.
On an informative note, the true cost per participant for us is about €200 (including €70 for the prize).

We are still cleaning the venue, next step will be the debrief article.
I hope some participants will leave their feedback here!
(i'm the organizer)

Not me, I have a blockchain-hackathon.com to organize :D
But there are quite a few known Bitcoiners there indeed!
@_date: 2015-10-06 17:11:54
There you go! Any feedback appreciated

Actually no, not only Bitcoin. By design, the Bitcoin blockchain is very limited for security reasons. Tracking assets for examples require colored coins, which are not a native feature but really a hack of what kind of information you can store in a transaction. More complex stuff such as atomic swaps and smart contracts need more features.
That said, we will have workshops around Ethereum and are open to any blockchain during the hackathon.
I'd personally love to see sidechains.
On the PR strategy, blockchain does not carry the "drugs/silkroad/MtGox" headlines, you can be quite certain that if the event was a "Bitcoin hackathon" we would not have sponsorship from these companies. 
Blockchain is still a clean name for now. Next year, I'd bet everybody uses "distributed ledgers" instead of blockchains...

Took 2 months to get two sponsors ;)
Hopefully one or two other sponsors will want to join, it would definitely improve the event and coverage.
One of the sponsor approached us, because they knew one of their direct competitor would be interested. You can't put competitors sponsoring the same event, so it's first come, first served.
I discussed with a lot of companies to raise the sponsorship, got tons of meetings, it's basically a full time gig for at least a month. Not easy, especially when time comes for budget approval.

No, need to be built from scratch (for fairness :) )
I will put that in the FAQ, thanks for the question!
@_date: 2015-10-21 23:54:15
Yay! The ticket price will be well worth it. But yes, this is a recurring complaint, although I couldn't find any other way to have a realistic estimate of the attendance. (when tickets are free, no shows are very high).
@_date: 2015-10-05 17:25:23
Fee is to avoid no-shows. The real cost per attendee for us is about €200, so the fee is just there as a "commitment" from the attendees to show up!
FAQ: working on it!
@_date: 2015-10-05 14:44:30
Yep, because they are the kind of company that implement projects at scale for governments and banks. They wouldn't sponsor if they didn't have demand from their clients, which is great news :)

Disclosure: I'm the guy organizing it ;)
Here are two quotes, from Fidelity and Deloitte:

I was expecting this question from day one, but you are the first to ask!
There are not many good ticketing platforms out there, I regularly use Eventbrite, Meetup and in this case Ti.to. None of them have a bitcoin implementation.
I requested the feature to Ti.to, but its still not there.
I can manually process bitcoin payments if needed.

Thank you OP for posting :)
I'm the organizer, AMA.

Other stats:  
* 19% of the developers participating have previous blockchain/Bitcoin experience  
* 20% of the participants are flying from abroad  
* 5% vegetarians :o  
And we just signed up a new (big) sponsor, will be announced next week!

Outside of the planning ahead well covered in the other comment, there is also the sponsorship. When the early birds go on sales, we usually don't know what the budget will look like. Sponsors are the main source of revenue, tickets are heavily subsidized. We operate on an expenditure between 120-140k euro this year for exemple. As we get closer to the event, we have a better idea of how much we will get from sponsors and we can regulate the increase in pricing accordingly. I hope that answers the question!
@_date: 2019-05-29 14:54:33
We will come :D
@_date: 2016-07-15 17:52:13
Last year was full house, I think it's still the biggest blockchain hackathon to date. (let me know if any had more than 150 participants!)
See you there hopefully, we will put the tickets on sale in a few weeks (€25)
