I think MaidSafe's is great! However from the token investor pespective... i don't see any fundamental reason why Madsafecoin has any value, as far as i understood back in 2013-2014 you don't actually need maidsafecoin for anything, within the safe network.
Edited: Before you guys keep downvoting, remember maidsafe originally did NOT include any token, the safecoin idea was introduced way later in 2013 (i think). The mechanics on how the token works seem to have changed since then.

I would say that the ability to short with leverage has made this downtrend especially extended. Years back when bitstamp and mtgox ruled the price, if you wanted to make a profit you had to buy and hold, now you can stomp and supress the price down for profit. Shorting has allowed this downtrend to become a vicious cycle where shorters get money from pushing the price down and once they take profit they short more, big players with short positions sell more to defend their positions, and with all the profit won people just wait for the price to climb to the top of the avarage price and start shorting more, thus never letting an uptrend develop. It is no coincidence that once exchanges with leverage started to dominate the market the downtrend became especially extended also it is not coincidence that the price rarely consolidates, instead it just keeps going down (we are actually in a consolidation zone, but we may just keep falling soon). "bububut traders couldn't short if bitcoiners didn't lend any bitcoins to short" Yeah but who can asure us that the exchanges are not lending fictional bitcoins and charging interests?
Am not blaming 100% to the traders, but yeah extended downtrends can cause lack of interest from the general public to buy, and if people does not buy, well, they can hardly adopt bitcoin.
Just my opinion of course, from the trader standpoint, but i can also see many other problems affecting adoption from new countries, like how hard is to get bitcoins without paying a huge premium or getting bitcoin miners without paying a big tax to import them, since you can't mine bitcoins with regular gpu's anymore.

Why is that bad? Isn't the idea of bitreserve simply to transfer value to an account? Bitcoin to Dollars, Mexican Pesos or Chinese Yuans, even if you are in Uganda you could have any other currency. Doesn't matter if they think bitcoin will be dead, they are giving a use case for bitcoin. It seems obvious to me, that Bitreserve is not a bitcoin wallet, is a currency wallet for other assets, you want to hold bitcoins? well, use a bitcoin wallet. For the idea they are presenting, bitcoin is only a way to transfer value, they could use litecoin for all i care.
Look, i don't like bitreserve in the sense that i don't find them that useful, but i can get the idea of what they are trying to do, transfer value to an account, thats all, not every bitcoin service will be created by bitcoin lovers, some will just use bitcoin as a tool, and thats ok.

I like Okcoin, their exchange is in fact superior to any other bitcoin exchange imho and i wish i could keep trading there. HOWEVER, i CAN'T keep trading there, it is not an option, and anyone still trading there is in for some sleepless nights. 
Let me make this more clear, staying at Okcoin is like being at a beautiful beach, then hearing the tsunami alarms but staying at the beach anyway just because it's beautiful and comfy, staring at the void with a solemn/stupid face thinking "maybe the one who activated those alarms is just a liar, right?, i trust this beach" while the water starts to flood the beach and screams can be heard in the background "hmjmm, i like this beach".
Look Okcoin, maybe Ver is lying, maybe CZ is lying, maybe you are lying, all you have to do is to prove you are solvent, i know it's stupid to do that each time someone accuses Okcoin of something, but this time is your own ex-CTO who is speaking against you, so you must find a way to prove your customers their money is safe, and you must do it with someone the community "trusts". Saying "hey, just withdraw your money so you see the withdraws are available" is like saying "Hey dudes, play musical chairs until someone can't withdraw at some point"
Just my opinion of course, i'm not coming back until i feel my funds are safe, and will not feel safe with void promises.

I agree VolaBit has a significant premium. However consider this:
* If you want to send a SWIFT transaction it will cost you 350 MXN (27 USD) in the best scenario and 600 MXN in the worst case scenario (46 USD), this even without inlcuiding how many USD you lose converting MXN to USD. 
* If you want to buy one bitcoin at Volabit incluiding  fees they will charge you a 21 USD premium right now. 
This means that as long as you intend to buy a maximum of 1.28 btc, you are better off using VolaBIT, if i added the MXN to USD bank charges to SWIFT money, this number would increase.
Also consider this:
* Sending money to BitStamp may take 2-5 days.
* Sending money to VolaBit takes 3 hours.
* Receiving money from BitStamp to Mexico takes more than a week.
* Receiving money from VolaBit takes less than a day if you don't sell on weekends (should work on weeks imho)
IF we were at volatile times, you would thank a lot buying in less than 3 hours.
So yeah... i woulnd't call VolaBit worthless right now, it has it's use.

@_date: 2014-04-29 09:09:51
My 281 words personal explanation.
Hello! Back in 2011, i tried to convince various Mexican investors into investing in bitcoin, so i got used to explain bitcoin fairly quick, this includes the most asked questions about how bitcoin functions. As is the first time they would be hearing about bitcoin (probably), you don't need to confuse them by getting too technical or 100% accurate, for example there is no need (for now) to explain the difference between "a bitcoin"/"bitcoin software"/"bitcoin network", your only objective is to get them interested in the idea of bitcoin. Also this is "investor oriented" but i think it works for everyone.
* 1) Bitcoin is digital money you can hold on your computer. As it is digital, you can send bitcoins to anyone around the world in matter of seconds via internet, with almost no fees.
* 2) Bitcoin's software is free to use. Bitcoin is not owned by any company or institution, it's software is developed by voluntaries around the world, anyone can see the code and contribute. You could contribute too.
* 3) Bitcoin it's private. Bitcoin does not require any of your personal information to make transactions, it is simply money, just as when you buy something at the store, you simply hand out the money.
* 4) Only 21 million bitcoins will be created, ever. Each 10 minutes, until around year 2140, new bitcoins are created and given to the bitcoin miners, which are voluntaries that make sure every transactions made in the bitcoin network is sent correctly, they also protect the bitcoin network from attacks. You can also be a bitcoin miner and discover that bitcoin is not created out of thin air, but rewarded in exchange of voluntary work. Miners also get the very small transaction fee you pay each time you send bitcoins.
* 5) Bitcoin value it's decided by the free market. Only offer and demand mechanics drive the price of bitcoin, as there is a limited quantity of bitcoins in existence, the more people is willing to buy and use bitcoin the more it's the value, and the more people it's willing to sell their bitcoins the less it's the value. This is why many people see bitcoin as an investment, as they think many more people will be willing to use bitcoin in the future.
As you can see, my explanation is noob friendly and emphasizes how you can be part of the bitcoin development if you want, so they don't feel left out. Also explains how bitcoin is not created out of thin air as most people think and how the price is established as most people don't understand it. This explanation has been working nicely for me since 2011. This doesn't directly obey the 2 sentences per bullet rule, but that's due the explanation style.

If you converted MXN to USD to keep them in Mexico, you wouldn't be able to mantain an equilibrium between your MXN teshold and you USD treshold, your MXN treshold would be depeleted right away and you would need to convert once again your USD sitting in Mexico to MXN to pay BTC sellers, effectively losing money to banks in fees and MXN/USD spread.
Also, AFAIK, you can't have a USD account in Mexican territory.

Not really, you could hold your private key in a hardware like trezor, request a transaction in your computer and authorize it (sign it) outside your computer via trezor, that way if the computer has some malware, the malware can't see your private key and can't send bitcoins.
But yeah it's a complicated way to say that you authorize your wallet to send bitcoins. If you had a normal wallet like Bitcoin-qt in your computer, you would simply send bitcoins and that's it, bitcoin-qt manages everything for you at that level.

What if i do not have a smartphone? People should be free even to create a wallet without a mail attached, i have created wallets this way, very useful.
The only thing blackchain.info should do is to warn about the dangers of not registering a mail or do not activate 2FA and that's it. Then i'll decide what's best.

For those who aren't familiar with this strategy, it's a moving offer, he puts a gigant sell that makes people put sells before it which drives the price down, then it moves the offer to a even lower price. Since he is the only one that knows when the wall is going to disappear he can buy "cheap" bitcoins and then disappear letting the price go up again.

Low liquidity. Of course this is normal, Mexico was never a bitcoin mining country or early adopter, so doesn't matter how you see it, if there are no coins for sale, there is no reason to send money there, so low liquidity. 
Don't worry, in the future there will be a liquid market here, just not now, so we need a VolaBit kind of exchange with a liquid and fixed price, not a Bitso/MexBT like exchange that uses limit orders.
Also MexBT is too rigid, following money transmitter KYC rules while VolaBit AT LEAST let you buy and sell 5,000 Mxn per day without KYC recon.
Bitso is cool but i don't feel like sending 100btc (i.e) to help a liquid market if they are still in beta (or the "send me bitcoins at your own risk" phase).
@_date: 2014-02-20 08:50:45
I'm a trader, so i'm not blinded by the "to the moon" thing, but how can you explain the price on other exchanges? That's the real price on the real support and real resistance, there is also a downward movement on other exchanges, however not so exagerated as in gox. I've been watching every movement on gox since the start of the downward in 9xx usd, there is definitely a shameless manipulation.

It is a strategy widely used, i've seem it work many times, i agree this time turned out to be a real sell as 3700 coins have been taken from it and the wall hasn't been removed. But since this was reddited and many people do not know this kind of strategies and freak out, i thought it would be a good thing to give a heads up before someone sells based on resistance intimidation.

Or use Blockchain.info, where they don't have control over your private keys, and only log via "live ubuntu" to avoid any virus... Really using live ubuntu can't be even considered technical, you just sweep your CD/USB and boot with it. Easy peacy, no one control your keys, and there are no virus.
AVOID BANKS.

I think it's a good idea for BB, but not for bitstamp or other big exchanges. Permanent withdraw address would imply that i cannot make payments directly from my exchange or send money to another person/exchange/service i want, i would always need to send them to another wallet, wait for the confirmation and then resend it. Also it would be too much of a hassle to Customer Support.
I don't see why people still get their money stolen still with 2FA and Mail confirmation (bitstamp) combo, mail can also be protected with 2FA.

Closer to 0%? wow, i'm also from Colima-México, for a long time i tried to think of the way to make a 0.2% fee happen in a country without btc liquidity, at the end my solution was a combination of a payment gateway (coinbase) AND an exchange built within the site, that way people who buy from the gateway adds liquidity to the exchange. I would be greatly surprised if you guys manage a close to 0% fee with a coinbase approach. I will deffinitely be revising your site and send you some ideas i tought of (if you didn't implement them already), since i will no longer create my own exchange i could at least contribute with some ideas.
@_date: 2014-02-01 07:08:46
**IMPORTANT NOTE:** You CAN'T pay with bitcoin in any of those stores, you can only pay via Pademobile which charges the bitcoins from your coinbase account, and pays 7-eleven in Mexican Pesos. So i wouldn't consider this an endorsement by any of those companies to bitcoin, it's just market expansion from Pademobile. Good work tho.
**English traduction of the article:**
Federal District- The 7-eleven store and the Ghandi bookstore, between other business, have started accepting bitcoin, the digital coin, as a payment method, revealed by Raúl Nogales, general director of Pademobile, company that offers bank accounts via cellphone numbers.
People that adquire bitcoin via Coinbase can link their accounts with his Pademobile wallet, which doesn't need any plastic card, it works via cellphone number.
At the date, it is only possible to do this transactions via Telcel and Movistar, Iusacell is in the progress of being added, said the general director (Raúl Nogales).
"Now you can link your Coinbase account with Pademobile, you can pay with your Coinbase bitcoins via Pademobile in; 7 Eleven, Caliente, Ghandi, you can pay electric bills, cable, some snacks, we are working like this since december", said Nogales

* "In BitcoinMarkets every kind of people post, from noobs to seasoned traders, i need to adquire experience to identify which is which"

Selling now (if you bought at a higher price) is ridiculous, china was not the only factor to rise to 1250, it was a strong factor yes, but not the only one. The only thing keeping the price down is the uncertainity of the market, once china either goes away or joins, we will start to grow again. Edit: To put you in perspective, when we were at 150 USD, the most important business taking bitcoin was wordpress, remember that? china is not everything.

"EDIT: Oh my god, how many "coins" are there?!"
There will only exist 21 million bitcoins in the future, it's a limited issuance, so the more people want them in the future the higher the price because... offer/demand. Read a bit about "bitcoin mining"  (but do not mine unless you study bitcoin mining very well)
If with coins you mean coins like "Dogecoin", "Darkcoin" etc, those are trying to compete with bitcoin by adding different features than bitcoin offers, but bitcoin is The One (and the original).
@_date: 2014-05-21 01:18:23
Okay now, don't cash out inmediately, wait 1 or 2 months, due the trend change in the price, that half bitcoin may be 4-7 times more valuable in relatively short time.  It would be like if people had donated 3.5 btc.

I always recommend this technique, but for some reason i always get downvoted, lol. It's very simple:
1- Burn a live ubuntu CD (NOT USB).
2- Enter ubuntu, which will have no viruses at all, since it's a new system each time you enter.
3- Create a online wallet in a site that doesn't hold your private keys, i use blockchain.info, activate 2FA ALWAYS, use a UNIQUE password.
4- Log into ubuntu each time you want to access your wallet.
Live ubunutu will free you from virus and 2FA from network attacks. Blockchain.info will send you a copy of your wallet, no one can access it unless they have got your unique password, so make it strong.

For those who do not understand spanish, Coincove is giving away about 0.05btc (25 usd), hidding those btc in little cards around Guadalajara City.
Are those cards liftable? Because if they are, well each possible new customer it's going to cost you 25USD, if those cards are not liftable then many people can try to claim the same prize even if they are too late, and those are many more interested participants/cutomers instead of one for 25USD.

Come on! even Peter Schiff had a better comprehension on bitcoin 2 years ago when he made "bitcoin vs gold" and i would think he didn't deploy a research team, mastercard had much more time to research. (

I see you are little confused on how bitcoin works, to easen up a lot your experience simply buy bitcoins at coincove.co. After that go and look for the facebook group "Bitcoin México" a lot of folks there will gladly help.
When you buy bitcoin you won't get "bitcoin dollars" you will get exactly what you buy, a bitcoin. The price of bitcoin changes everyday so if you buy one bitcoin when it costs 500USD and then use it when it costs 520USD you basically won 20USD in value becuase your bitcoin was more valuable the day you used it. You can buy fractions of a bitcoin, like 0.5 bitcoins or 0.05 bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-11-03 05:29:08
Yeah, but really if you want tipping to work out, you need to tip meaningful tips, 0.1 cent tips aren't going to get anyone interested in fact people will get annoyed by the spam, remember dogecoin tippings in r/bitcoin? everyone was annoyed because they tipped 0.0000001 cents and that didn't have any sense.

We can condense points 4) and 5) easily, leaving a 190ish words explanation. 
* 1) Bitcoin is digital money you can hold on your computer. As it is digital, you can send bitcoins to anyone around the world in matter of seconds via internet, with almost no fees.
* 2) Bitcoin software is free to use. Bitcoin is not owned by any company or institution, it's software is developed by voluntaries around the world, anyone can see the code and contribute. You could contribute too.
* 3) Bitcoin it's private. Bitcoin does not require any of your personal information to make transactions, it is simply money, just as when you buy something at the store and hand out the money.
* 4) Only 21 million bitcoins will be created, ever. New bitcoins are created each 10 minutes and rewarded to “miners”, computers dedicated to protect bitcoin and verify every transaction is valid. You could set up your own bitcoin miner.
* 5) Bitcoin value it's decided by the free market (Offer and demand). As the number of bitcoins in existence is limited, the more people decides to use bitcoin, the more is the value of each bitcoin. This is why many people see bitcoin as an investment.
Edited: Further bullets could be worked if you want (for example it's gold-like properties), but i think this is all regular people would be interested in.

No, Mexicans can't send money to Coinbase to buy bitcoin, however coinbase is an online bitcoin wallet, that meaning that any mexican with bitcoins can create a coinbase account and deposit there bitcoins he already have, then expend them via pademobile.
Yeah basically is a service to expend bitcoins you already have. Also means that if you are a USA resident planning a trip to Mexico, you could travel paying for food and services with your bitcoins, so you don't carry money.

Sure thing, Mexico needed this kind of companies, i'm glad some of you guys stepped up. I also tried to figure out a way to reduce fees at minimum on a coinbase-like exchange (adding the low demand issue), it's a hard problem to solve indeed, i wish you luck.

I didn't say i leave all my savings at an exchange, but i certainly still use the exchange to do different movements. Maybe like me you sell bitcoins locally, just like a bitcoin ATM does, you buy directly from the exchange and send money to your customer (yes i know about KYC/AML). As i said there are different reasons to send bitcoins directly from the exchange.

Nah this investement is better off here in Mexico, i bet there will be a great demand for bitcoin here once people know about it.

* I take it that anyone who is going through the hassle of setting all of this up at the moment is interested in moving more than 1.28 BTC
Depends on what exactly are you going to do, i have moved less than 1 btc in many occasions, for different purposes. Of course moving a major quantity requires further work in order to lose less money.
* Furthermore, I would think that a good proportion of the people who are interested in BTC in Mexico right now already have access to US bank accounts
I don't think so, i wasn't even able to open a USD account, and i tried at: Banamex, ScotiaBank, HSBC and Santander, i was told that having a USD account in Mexico was forbidden unless you lived in a turistic zone. Also i don't have any idea on how to open a US account from Mexico and i have been in bitcoin since 2011.
As i said, i agree the premium is high, but the company has it's uses, you can't open a perfect company with the perfect model at once without testing the market with different models, maybe reducing fees requires major efforts that they can't handle right now. I think they are on the right path.

Miners have all the incentive they need, bticoin rewards. What happens is that the mining folks miscalculated and over-invested in bitcoin mining gear when the price was high, not considering that the price needed to go down at some point and now they can't get their investment back. What will happen next is that some miners won't afford to keep paying the energy they consume on mining, unplug their mining gear, difficulty will decrease leaving the profit for the people that  still can afford to run the miners at the point they make marginal earnings and the network will keep being secure. Next year or this year in the next bitcoin bubble people will start over-investing again.

I'm going to go ahead and add an optional sixth bullet (33 words):
* 6) Bitcoin can be considered a store of value. Bitcoin it’s limited in number and it’s unspoilable, just like gold, furthermore  bitcoin can be easily stored, backed up and requires almost no space.
@_date: 2014-10-11 19:28:42
Step 1: Have a treshold of dollars at bitstamp (100,000 USD for example)
Step 2: When people buys bitcoins, use that treshold to buy for them at bitstamp and keep the pesos in México.
Step 3: When people sell bitcoins, sell those bitcoins for USD in bitstamp and keep the dollars there, use the pesos you kept from the previous buyers to pay the new sellers in pesos.
See? No need to send money constantly across borders or convert currencies on banks, an equilibrium between sellers and buyers will keep both of your tresholds stable. If for example your USD reserve at bitstamp runs low, you send a BIG international wire which is cheaper than a small wire and you recover that wire cost by incresing the spread some days until you recover it.
At least that's how i would do it.
@_date: 2015-01-25 10:55:26

If bitcoin price rises, he has to pay 655btc, which are 250kusd at a price of 381usd, but if vivek loses it's because btc price was above 381usd, which means that he will end up paying way more than 250k. While Wences sits comfortably at 250k.

I've been "against" leverage, specially shorting for a simple reason, bitcoin is a deflatory currency (over time), it's supposed to store it's value via scarcity.
With leveraged shorting, there is no way to know if the bitcoins offered for leveraged shorting are actually bitcoins, or just an exchange offering fictional bitcoins making profits of the interest rate of bitcoins that may or may not actually exist.
If an exchange tried to trade itself with fictional bitcoins there  would be a huge risk of loss; if an exchange offers fictional bitcoins for traders to dump the markets and profit from interest rates there is no risk for the exchange, just the trader. 
If we had a mechanism to prove that the bitcoins being traded are actual bitcoins and not fictional bitcoins, then i would be (sort of) okay with leveraged shorting.
@_date: 2015-01-06 05:56:00
I have had a heavy road too, a really reaaaaally heavy road as well. But i'm not going to surrender, the only one that loses is the one that surrenders.
That being said, you can go to work and stay in bitcoin, you can live in both worlds. I made bitcoin my job and i'm risking a lot, but you can live in the middle ground if it's too heavy for you.
Edit: Also, you recomended bitcoin to people, you did not put a knife against them making them invest, sooo it was their own choice and research. Don't carry the weight of other people decisions.

He however still can't get past the mental barrier of owning something digital instead of physical, it's not about ignorance it's about preference. 
Also as far as i remember, he did say bitcoin was in a bubble at 780usd, and bitcoin WAS in a bubble at the time, no one that bought at 780usd is having "massive gains" not even now, that's like a 30% gain since 2013. 
I don't agree with him, but he is not ignorant at all.

xD! the only way to make money out of ETC was to short it, which by the way doesn't kill ETH, kills ETC, which helps ETH. So either the guy helped ETH or lost money buying ETC, which may explain why he is so angry at ETH.

Sooo in the process of RSK "merged-mining" what do miners get? only fees? 
@_date: 2016-11-07 00:47:47
So let me understand how supply works here.
1) People mine RSK.
2) People with RSK tokens lend them to 2WP exchanges.
3) People with bitcoin go to a 2WP exchange and lock bitcoins for RSK tokens. 
4) RSK supply unaffected, no new RSK tokens were created by the exchanges after locking up the bitcoins.
Is that how this works?

This is a very regular market development, general public is in shock and perceive the price much lower than "it should be", especially since we had been steadily dropping since 300, thats why we stopped for a moment.

There are two issues here, the blocksize issue and the censorship issue. You are trying to keep people ignorant of a very relevant topic such as the existence of XT and the possible fork, just because you don't want it to happen. Regardless of if you think XT is a software to create an altcoin or not, if XT takes control of the majority of the network, it WILL affect *bitcoin* users. Big companies will know of XT, traders will know of XT, miners will know of XT, who do you think the ignorance will affect? Yes, the regular people thats doesn't have the time of digging around for censored information, regular holders.
After reading your anti-XT reasoning, i agree with you about the consensus issue, for now. But by censoring the existence of XT, you will only make people feel betrayed due to the hidden information that should have been available for everyone, in consecuence, people will go and revenge-install XT, which is happening at this very moment. 
By the way, i do respect rules as long as they make sense, censoring  XT doesn't:

Well my friend, it's a tradeoff, you are adopting bitcoin's risks to be able to use the bitcoin's properties, in this case, you would be using the bitcoin's ability to give you full control of your money so your government can't control your wealth, however you would be exposing yourself to volatility, no one here will be able to guarantee that  your bitcoins won't lose half of it's value tomorrow (however it's not probable). 
What you can do it's simply to do not put all the eggs in the same basket, if you need bitcoin to avoid governmet control, just buy a fraction of your wealth in bitcoin and hold it, if you are only looking to move your wealth out of greece you could do it gradually buying some and selling some outside greece (exchanges, bitreserve, etc), once you start using bitcoin, you will figure out how to use it as a tool to move money around, but you needed to do all this research before your state controlled your money, not until now when your money is already controlled by your government :P

I understand your position, it's really hard to spot the difference between trashcoins, scamcoins, spamcoins, and real innovations; not because it's really hard to do so, but solely because there are tons of those and no one can research every single one. Dogecoiners were extremely annoying, by spamming with it's cult-like behaviour, imagine if mods allowed that for each trashcoin.
That being said, i don't think it hurts to allow ONE thread about the launch of well known altcoins, or other altcoin milestones (if there is any). You can't say Ethereum is completely unrelated to bitcoin and you know that. 
Anyway, i do respect the politics in this regard in but i think people is missing some good info.

Sure, and you would know that AFTER you play with ALL your settings, it's not intuitive, the user is never warned, it's not secure, also you need to globally lock your settings just for the 2fa to work as intended, also you gotta lock your settings from time to time which it's also insecure.
In short, it's a pretty bad design that puts users at risk.

Oh you were? haha well i didn't think this conversation was hostile at all to begin with.
I do use kraken, i've always used log-in and withdraw 2fa, i was not affected by the phishing attacks that happened some weeks ago, it's just my opinion on the security of kraken. 
You see, my point was, there are ways to bypass the log-in 2fa (even if you have it activated), that's why services use a second 2fa for withdraws, kraken however allowed the user to easily turn off the withdraw 2fa (without confirming that the person turning off 2fa had control of the 2fa device) effectively making it useless since any intruder that already bypassed log-in 2fa could turn it off as well, unless you locked your global settings, however this last bit was never warned to the user by kraken, kraken only told the users that they had to lock global settings to make withdraw 2fa effective after the series of phishing victims that fell for it some weeks ago. Making withdraw 2fa effective was as easy as asking the user to type-in the current withdraw 2fa code before allowing him to turn it off, proving that the person turning off the withdraw 2fa was effectively the owner of the account, but they never added that easy step.

What stops a phisher from asking the 2fa code at the fake kraken and programing to instantly going inside, disabling the withdraw 2fa and ordering a withdraw? You don't even need to be that imaginative, simple physical access can do the trick. 
The point is, there is a reason why there are two stages for the 2fa, log-in and withdraw, if it was as easy as you portray then no one would ever waste resources into implementing withdraw 2fa. And the fact that kraken's withdraw 2fa doesn't work as intended from the instant you activate it, it's simply bad design. 
Edited: And btw, there are tons of reports of people getting "hacked" even with log-in 2fa activated in different services. Consider that.

Ok this opinion is not very popular but i'm going to say it anyway; This is all about regular market development, we consolidated, fundamentals got better in the meanwhile, it's time to rise launching from our newly found floor to a new price discovery.
It's always, always the same stuff, people try to blame one single event or entity for a whole market development, there is *no way* for MMM, which lasted years and years of shilling to steal 10billion to pump a 4 billion market in such as small amount of time.

I'm also very doubtful to subscribe as a Teller, specially in Mexico, where you can find dangers below a rock. Mexico is the country with the most remittances but also the most dangerous.
At the top of my head, thinking maliciously, i can come up with 2 easy scenarios to hurt users; Be a teller, build some reputation, wait for a big remittance, get an assailant friend ready to assault on the person i just gave the money, it's not my fault it was a coincidence, i keep being a teller until my new  reputation buries the comment about a single user being assaulted, repeat.
For being a teller, i could use my house, install some sort of cash dispenser were i slide the cash to the user safely from my house, however i actually need to get in and out of my house with physical money at some point, right? So i'm effectively a target and assailants know my house.
I can hardly come up with a solution, except to send bank transfers to my customer being a teller, however at least in mexico, there is a 60 minutes lag between adding 1 person to your contact database in the bank and actually being able to send money. However moving so much money inside the banking system can flag me as money launderer, and i don't want the AFI (Mexico's FBI) knocking my door down carrying assault riffles.

You are seeing it backwards, a supply shock doesn't mean that people suddenly need bitcoin, it means we will have less selling pressure and profit taking, which allow bulls to advance easier. Speculators price it in way before it actually happens tho.
Edited: By the way, if you think "Bitcoin has no demand" You will be surprised on how easily mass psychology can turn from bear to bull and from bull to bear, just by seeing several red or green days.

Not really, because tools like Crowdin already exist. However the "claim" system is how i would do it, since a single translator is in charge of a whole tutorial, which means he will keep the whole tutorial coherent and in context.

Awww Barry doesn't know that volume at china is fake, if you want to watch it yourself then go to -&gt;  and keep and eye on the inferior-right corner, those are real time executed orders, you will see (may take some hours) big buys or sells (2k, 1k, etc) that were suddenly executed, but not a single bitcoin was bought or sold in the orderbook, hence, volume is fake, is not about the 0% fee making them volatile, its just plain fake.

This is a very good explanation. However there is also people that simply like to mock new ideas, has happened all over history, most new ideas fade away or are not functional, so it's easy and confortable to mock them focusing on the negative and probable fail points, also makes them feel real smart once those ideas fail and fade away. 
Lucky for us Bitcoin hasn't failed or faded away haha.

That doesn't really mean anything bullish, it's all about timing, all december we had a very weak green MACD just like now, and we did not change to bull trend.
Macd measures strength in movements, this means bear strength is gone, but doesn't not mean it won't return or it will become bullish.
I am bullish, but not because a random timeframe MACD cross.

Alternatively, they could have a built in claim system; register as a translator, "claim" a tutorial and a language to translate , finish and upload your translation in less than 24 hours, no other translator can deliver a translation for that tutorial and language, the translation is revised and approved or discarded, if the translation is discarded or the claimer didn't upload the translation then the "claim" button is available again for that language.
If 21 plans on doing a very extensive tutorial recopilation, then creating this system would be worth it, considering how many languages there are, this would also reduce the amount of work to revise (since they would not need to revise repeated work).

Well, the problem is that they didn't use a translation per phrase system (where you know which part of the text has already been translated), so by the time i finish translating to another language, some other guy probably already sent a translation for the same tutorial, so maybe i'm working for nothing.
@_date: 2015-10-10 19:57:30
Bears can't fight a supply shock ladies and gents, if it is easier to long than to short, then that will happen. I also don't think we will wait until the actual havling, probably bulls that already comprehend the supply shock effect will be buying way before that, getting us out of the 200-300 zone of 2015. In fact, i declare 2015, the most stable and therefore boring as hell bitcoin price range.

Well... having a full node has become a burden, i've tried at least 4 times to have one, but it consumes too much of my already poor internet connection.
That doesn't mean however that i don't participate in the bitcoin economy actively, it's just easier to have my btc on Blockchain.info. 
If we were ever to run dangerously low on full nodes i would run one, and a lot of people interested in bitcoin success would do the same if they weren't doing it already.

Let me put people outside Mexico in perspective, Salinas Pliego owns Grupo Salinas or ["Salinas Group"]( which is a  group of business with great influence in Mexico, two of those business are of major importance for bitcoin; TV Azteca and Azteca Bank. 
TV Azteca is the second most important media group in Mexico, half of the TV channels available for free in Mexico are owned by TV Azteca (and many other influential media outlets as well). Azteca Bank is not as dominant on it's field as TV Azteca is on it's field, however it was originally created targeting low income people and remittances, it is still a very big business.
For those who don't click yet, Bitreserve could basically work with Azteca Bank for remittances, and Azteca bank will for sure advertise it's new services for remittances at all TV Azteca channels, as it always has. Most business who are linked to Salinas Pliego, end up being advertised via TV Azteca.
Hope this helps you to understand the potential of this Pliego-Bitreseve alliance. Personally i dislike TV Azteca and Azteca bank due to political reasons, but this is for sure interesting. 
I should also add, that Mexico is one of the countries that most use remmitance services... just in case you didn't know.
