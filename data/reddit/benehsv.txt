No the hash proof of work is proof of energy/computation. A miner with twice the mining power of another miner can solve the PoW puzzle in expected half the time. A proof of time is a proof that no one should be able to produce in less than a minimum time regardless of the computation power.

Forgive me if this is stupid but doesn't the UTXO have a natural limit? There is only going to be 21'000'000 bitcoin and the total value of the UTXO asymptotically constant.  Of course it is possible that the value per UTXO decreases but why should this decrease be exponential?

The idea of the protocol is that the exchange wants to maintain privacy. The provision protocol allows an exchange to prove solvency without revealing its total assets or even a single address that it owns.

Minimize the amount the user has to store. For example keeping it constant with respect to the size of the dataset would be good.

I was a TA for that class. Can highly recommend the class material and especially Joe's book which the class is based on.

So as it says look at what a merkle tree can do for you and you are almost there.

My German bank also called me because they said the account was on some kind of list. But once I said I can asses the risk they proceeded with the transer.

Don't wanna be a smartass here, but he could easily do it. 
He would just need to sign something with the Private Key of a Walltet containing&gt; 200 BTC and you could verify it using his Public Key.

How are you going to declare tem? Do you think customs duty will be added? I am from Switzerland.

Like one or two days to deposit. But from a German account to the German Fidor Bank. Maybe its 2-3 days for SEPA but I don't know

I transferred some money there and I hope it will establish itself as a second big EUR Exchange. They are a well funded and smart company (I met some of them at Bitcoin London). There fees are low and both deposits and withdraws have been frictionless so far. Needless to say that they hardly have any volume yet, but I hope this improves as competition will improve service and lower fees in the long term.

I tried to withdraw bitcoins an hour ago but it doesn't show up on the network:

This is technically very much possible right now one bitcoin can be split in 10^8 parts this could easily be changed to 10^10 or 10^16. Also people are starting to post prices in centi/milli or micro btc. It only is a psychological problem not a technical one.
