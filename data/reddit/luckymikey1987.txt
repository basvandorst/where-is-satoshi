It doesn't actually make that much difference. People can sell and buy for whatever the reason. Short trading, mid trading, long trading, as currency, as utility... As long as they use it, bitcoin will be strong. Your advice to always hodl long term wouldn't be that great for bitcoin.

It's a gabmle, I know, but think if you could take if it shot up to 100k and you AGAIN didn't buy? For me answer is no so I HODL. Remember invest amount you can lose, ideally invest something that you were going to spend on something useless...
