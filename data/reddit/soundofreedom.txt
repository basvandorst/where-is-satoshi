Am I the only one who wishes we would all shun Gox until they prove their own solvency? Am I too optimistic to hope that they would choose to release their financial statements on their own and give regulators a reason to back off? Dreaming of when consumers force accounting regulations with their own business independent of government interference?
I'm a dreamer, on the other hand a risk premium 2/3 the going rate of Bitcoin is too much for me to stomach with my own miniscule savings.

Serious question: what will be the short term affect of Mt. Gox going under?
@_date: 2014-04-08 17:25:07
Agreed, from a financial perspective: the volatility on future cash flows is too high to create a reasonable estimate of present value.

So I followed some of those 'points of interest' and wound up [here]( Where you can sign up for spam email and conspiracy theories like ones propagated by [this website]( where people like this ['upstanding citizen' G. Edward Griffin]( who was seen in the video at 'bankers worst fear' and who is also in cahoots with other citizens of similar rapport like [alex jones]( who runs [prison planet]( and [infowars.]( will try to convince you that the Bilderbergs are running the planet
If one clicks through all the links you'll find pretty quickly that all of these conspiracies are many half truths laced with poor sourcing and illogical conclusions. These are the same men that almost duped my father into buying survival rations, a 4-minute exercise machine and a cure for cancer that supposedly no one wants anyone to find out about, except for my father of course.
I wouldn't take any of this seriously, these men are wolves in sheeps' clothing, and they are interested in one thing: your fiat, and bitcoins too if you have those.

We live in a political economy, in an ideal world you would be right, but wishful thinking does not justify willful ignorance. Interest rates and the quantity of money drastically affect market equilibrium prices of labor, land and capital. Whether one is a construction worker or an investment banker monetary policy has immediate and quantifiable affects on ones daily standard of living, and ones long term out look for retirement. Don't be so naive to think these are the machinations of one political party. Monetary policies have sweeping implications for every human being regardless of nationality, political beliefs or personal preferences, and you sir have your head so far up your own ass I'm having trouble distinguishing your nose from your Adam's apple.

From an economic standpoint quantity supplied of mortgages has no causal effect on the interest rate of those mortgages. It could be 2% or 8% APR and you can have the same Qs. So your dismissal of the CRA is made upon shoddy economic logic.
You also mention subsidies for home ownership, yes this does cause a rightward shift in the demand curve for housing, however those subsidies are still in place today, those tax subsidies never changed. Those tax policies also have nothing to do with fed monetary policy. You could say that we can only afford the subsidies because of fed monetary policy but that actually applies to everything. We have yet to actually see the inflation we should rationally expect from the increase in the quantity of money. That right there is a symptom of the velocity of that money rapidly decreasing in certain market sectors. You know how big banks got the bailout? (among others) Check their UBPR reports for off balance sheet assets, it's sitting at 6 trillion for JPM. What are these banks doing with the Fed money? Loaning it back to the treasury, and profiting off of the disparity in the yield curve from Fed Funds and T-securities. You're right to bemoan this Fed policy, it's incredibly dangerous and we haven't seen the grand repercussions we should expect because the effects have remained isolated in a small percentage of the market.
I would posit we have a new bubble, and we will see the L/T effects pending a market correcting. Just look at the P/E ratios among different asset classes and their historical averages. As Stein's law states: "If something cannot go on forever, it will stop."
However there is consensus among economists that the CRA caused the housing bubble and stock market crash because: 
*Banks were forced to give out mortgages to individuals whose credit-worthiness was questionable at best.
*Financial intermediaries created mortgage backed securities with this debt.
*Ratings agencies like Moodys gave this debt unjustifiable credit ratings, this is partially due to the fact that financial intermediaries pay the bill when their own products are rated.
In conclusion, we know now that these banks would **NEVER** have made these loans except for the CRA.
Here's a [good read]( on it if you want to know more.
Anyways, I'm not trying to bust your balls, but i think you got a few things wrong in your estimation of the causality with regards to Fed monetary policy and Fed housing policy. It is of colossal importance that individuals understand the negative externalities of financial interference; the correction of markets has immediate and long term affects on the prices and rates of land labor and capital. The implications of which have immediate and quantifiable affect on an individuals marginal utility, standard of living, and prospects for retirement.

This is a huge deal in the finance industry. I'm sitting in the trading center of my university right now and the whole room is buzzing about this. Really for the past 6 months every professor has been wondering what bitcoin is, and whether or not they should care...
Now they should, and is it any surprise? Bitcoin has had an age gap among finance people for far too long, hopefully this will close the gap.

Market Equilibrium (my sarcastic answer.)
edit: My real answer is that I don't have a set price, I am not trying to time the market. I think bit coins are incredibly risky, I am ready to lose all of the money I have in bit coins, and I won't put anything more into them that I am willing to lose. That being said, I believe in this currency, I think it's important, and if bitcoin fails I believe that a superior digital currency will replace it. I take a small percentage of my income every month and buy bitcoins. I am not interested in what happens today, or tomorrow, or a week from now. I am interested in what happens 1-2 years from now. I just hadn't done it yet this month.

We aren't forced to hold dollars, just use them. Dollar denominated assets can be an effective hedge against inflation, i.e. real assets, and I don't mean gold alone. 
The real losers in the inflationary economy are the working class, paycheck to paycheck. They don't see the new money until the market has adjusted.

I am actually seeing similar issues and I have lost 9.02 bitcoins because of it. I am beside myself as a college student it is a huge loss and I don't know what to do. I have been out my money for a month.
For the record, I issued a sell order for 9.02 bitcoins on september 28th, the btc was sold but the bank deposit was reversed. Coinbase has not tried to rectify this issue on their own, so I have taken it to their customer service. The first go around I was eventually ignored without any resolution. In my second attempt (which I started yesterday) I explained the same issue and a customer service rep told me she would take my case to her supervisor. However it has been a day and I haven't heard back. My coin was sold but I am short the dollars as well and I'm livid.

Bitcoin solves the inflation problem.
However, 6 block tx fee amounts to ~6% of the transaction price for a cup of coffee. 
So approximately 6% fee to make the transaction happen in an hour.
If you want that transaction to clear within minutes, the fee as a % of the cup of coffee jumps to around ~25%. 
In dollars the fee is nominal, but if you want bitcoin to serve the masses, since most of the masses aren't located in the United States, the fee needs to fall dramatically to facilitate mass adoption.

There is one specific flaw of this argument with regards to china.


Market capitalization of bitcoin vs. capital outflows is far different than the [unit velocity]( of bitcoin. If China is truly 95% of this transaction volume China will find far more than $12.9 Billion in capital flight from the country. 
**This is of significant importance** and raises the risk of action by PBoC far more than this article would lead you to believe
