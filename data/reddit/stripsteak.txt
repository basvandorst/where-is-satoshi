It’s cool that it’s a thing.
However the one I’ve used before always quoted the price of Bitcoin at $400usd more than it was currently worth.

I know Walpole and Newport haven it!

I find it awesome that this is a thing. But I’ve first hand checked them out and it will always claim the price of Bitcoin is 200-350 more expensive than it really is.

Is bitcoin considered an investment?

I can 100% agree on the state of housing in NH. Me and my wife have been house hunting for a year now and everything is either so far gone it wouldn't be worth it. Or under contract within a day or so. Got into a bidding war about a month ago on a place and walked away with a sour taste in my mouth.

Let’s look back on this in 10 years and laugh at how in 2029 that would only cover four bitcoins.

Yeah the areas we’re kinda stuck looking in (halfway between my work and hers) the taxes are outrageous.
One of the homes we were looking at (Claremont) nicer part on the outskirts was 7k a year in taxes. For what?! That’s just crazy. The home itself was only about 150k. So yes it basically would have been a double mortgage.
We’re not overly aggressive atm maybe a years time will help settle a little bit of the frenzy that’s going on right now.

Now tie the color to the current value so you can glance over and see how things are going!
