Yep and of course they should.

You handed in 3 guns?  That's a good little citizen.  \*pat pat pat\*

Right, because the government should make a law that says it won't take away the internet, honest it won't.

If you heard him on Peter McCormack's podcast, it's pretty clear he doesn't care that much -- not enough to actually push for it.
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:51:51
Luke, do you do any podcast or video interviews?  Might reach a bigger audience that way.  
@_date: 2017-03-29 12:57:49
You're pathetic.
@_date: 2019-03-30 19:02:29
He has it backwards.  Increased automation increases the purchasing power of money, e.g. watch technology prices over time.  Inflation (increased money supply) is what reduces purchasing power
@_date: 2019-03-30 19:07:38
The owner of automation can now purchase goods that wouldn't have otherwise been available without his automation.  If he buys goods with this money, he now owns more goods and purchasing power of other money holders remains unaffected.  If he chooses to hold his money rather than sell it for goods, all other money holders' purchasing power increases.

Maybe they should make me a moderator.
@_date: 2019-06-13 19:23:30
Good interview.
@_date: 2019-06-05 14:24:58
Reported you for shilling bch.  Please go cry on r/btc about it.
@_date: 2019-06-05 19:12:20
Talking about bcash on r/bitcoin is shilling.  A good moderation policy would be that shitcoin projects should only be discussed in the context of improving Bitcoin and/or its ecosystem.  This is simply not possible with bcash.
@_date: 2019-06-05 19:17:32
This is not a debate.  If you don't like it, again, please go cry on r/btc about it.
@_date: 2019-04-11 13:45:57
The Mueller report is not what your ilk said it would be regardless of the specifics.  Maybe you should get over it instead of trying to apply this stupid Russia collusion narrative to Assange's arrest.
@_date: 2019-04-11 14:10:10
I've read up. It doesn't. Also none of that has anything to do with the Chelsea Manning stuff, which this arrest was about. Your concerns are clearly nothing more than partisan butthurt over an election your side lost.
@_date: 2019-04-11 12:54:29
What else did he do, Chief?
@_date: 2019-04-11 13:31:25
Maybe it's you that wants all journalists to align with your narrative.  
How about when he went after GWB lying the US into war?  Oh wait, Clinton supporters love wars now so that was bad too.
@_date: 2019-04-11 14:36:51
@_date: 2019-04-11 12:53:38
what are you talking about?
@_date: 2019-04-11 14:24:29
"No one to praise" because he tried to influence an election to keep what he believes to be a warmonger out of office?  Ok.
@_date: 2019-04-11 14:19:22
Democracy and rule of law are incompatible.  I'm a libertarian, don't care about Trump either way, but I hope he pardons Assange.
@_date: 2017-04-20 17:14:38
It's hard to believe it's actually possible to be as dumb as you appear to be.
@_date: 2019-04-11 17:57:15
I'm finding upvote/downvote ratios interesting here.  Who'd have thought r/bitcoin would be populated by so many state-worshipping bootlickers.  The hatred for Assange appears to be purely based on the belief that he influenced the US presidential election.  Which of course has no relevance to his arrest.
You'd think Bitcoiners would have some principles on issues like this.  Free Ross posts seem to generate a similar response to this, sadly.
@_date: 2017-04-28 04:01:24
The only "coordination" I see is a bunch baghodlers still dumb enough to buy into your boy genius shtick.  But that will work itself out in the long run.
@_date: 2019-04-11 15:15:16
That's irrelevant, but it explains your spite for him and unprincipled cheering of his arrest.
@_date: 2017-04-13 08:58:04
It looks like Bitclub is a ponzi scheme.  See 
If they are entering their terminal phase, as every ponzi eventually does, they may be desperate for returns.  Increased BU signalling has so far proven to reliably cause altcoins to skyrocket, at the expense of the Bitcoin market cap.  
So one possibility is that they have shorted bitcoin, and are long on various altcoins, in a last ditch effort to keep their ponzi going.
@_date: 2019-04-11 13:41:49
Truly pathetic.
@_date: 2017-04-29 21:15:38
Anyone can say they're an ancap.  I think adherents to any ideology can be easily scammed by someone who speaks their language.
@_date: 2017-04-27 16:49:06
Ethereum's main purpose seems to have always been to steal market cap from Bitcoin, so of course they'd agree to this.  
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:15:53
Well speak for yourself.  Some of us do actually try to be good people now and again.
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:19:01
Yes, how silly of me to have read a little bit of monetary history.
@_date: 2018-11-21 16:51:36
Point is that you started this, so maybe you're the bad person here.
@_date: 2019-01-13 22:20:06
Haven't we have had a real world test of this over the past several years?  Mining has already been monopolized by actors hostile to the current protocol, but so far they have been unable to force changes on it.  And clearly this is not for lack of effort on their part.  
Now with Bitmain facing bankruptcy as a direct result of their efforts to take over protocol governance, notwithstanding the stupidity of their approach, it looks like creating hostile mining monopolies may be unwise.  
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:21:53
Then how about stfu about it, kthxbye.
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:30:08
Seems like you're having trouble here, maybe you aren't familiar with Bretton Woods?
@_date: 2019-01-18 17:02:38
Also to those of you downvoting this post, please explain why.
@_date: 2019-01-18 20:45:31
No thanks.

Poe's law?  But I'm sure you meant to say, what right does the state have to impose capital controls.

How about you stop saying that with 20 different reddit accounts for the last 2 years?

The point about risks is important.  This is much different from BU or other hard forks, in that as far as I can tell, those taking the risks are the ones that continue to buy coins on the old chain, (if malicious miners create a temporarily longer old chain), since old chain is the one that risks getting reorgd out of existence.
So, if segwit chain gains a market price, there's a big incentive for it to build momentum and wipe out the other chain.  In contrast, BU had the opposite problem and would have itself gotten reorgd away.
(sorry for all the edits)
@_date: 2017-05-14 03:46:49
With no changes, it's still a swiss bank account in your pocket.  Ethereum or Ripple, say, can never be that.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:55:12
UASF is just activation mechanism.  Doesn't matter if you support it, segwit is the issue.
@_date: 2017-05-02 15:43:55
Ok, then activate segwit.  Problem solved.  
@_date: 2017-05-10 23:23:47
No.  Guess you saw it though.
@_date: 2017-05-02 14:50:45
You apparently live in bizarro upside-down alternate universe.  Or just pretending to be stupid.
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:54:54
Why is honesty so hard for you r/btc people?
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:50:32
Looks like you're wrong on both counts.
@_date: 2017-05-02 15:56:16
I don't want to reduce fees.  They pay to secure bitcoin.  So, status quo then.  Sounds good to me.
@_date: 2017-05-27 01:41:13
500 that have fired up a node.  Even if we had 5,000 nodes, that's not the important thing.
Again, smart money jumps on board when price starts rising.  Lots of fence sitters right now, but 90% want segwit.  
@_date: 2017-05-19 17:32:01
Lots of movement on 148 right now.
@_date: 2017-05-02 15:17:37
Nope.  I'm good with status quo, but segwit would be nice.
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:28:31
Not if segwit chain skyrockets in price immediately.  But you won't have a chain to stay on if you dumped the segwit chain -- miners will all flip to it at that point, because it will be Bitcoin (longest chain).
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:57:58
Hope you help us out on BIP148.  Hodlers like you are the key to ensuring that miners are forced on board.  Check out Bitcoin Core slack discussion if you have questions about how to help.  
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:30:23
Idk, I'm coming up empty on that scam search.  I was thinking it was either someone that worked on colored coins, or the selfish mining attack guy (not emin, but the one that actually described it first).  So if it's not you, then my apologies.
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:22:36
Alex agreed to it on the uasf slack channel.
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:24:47
UASF succeeded already.  Try to keep up.
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:13:41
Scalable segwit chain, versus old chain that could get reorgd away.  
@_date: 2017-07-27 18:12:30
The point is their PR efforts went full-throttle during the scaling crisis.  Indeed, Vitalik himself wrote numerous braggy tweets and blog articles specifically about how Bitcoin should scale around that time.  There was a very obvious agenda there that had nothing to do with building "legit tech".
And I'll add, it's certainly debatable whether centralized bloated blockchains are legit tech.
@_date: 2017-05-13 12:58:34
The thugs in this argument don't matter, and are not the reason for the standstill.  And maybe a standstill is fine, an unchangeable Bitcoin is a good thing.
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:54:10
Ethereum was started by marketers and ponzi pumpers.  That they timed things right with fake Bitcoin "scaling crisis", and that they are pretty good pumpers makes it not too surprising we've seen this kind of rise, along with other various alts (including Ripple, ffs).
IIRC you were involved in some scam a few years back, right?  Can't remember which one.   Found this thread  think Caldwell had this exactly right, if nothing else based on the what we've seen over the last year with DAO, and then recently ICOs.  It seems strange that you haven't changed your views much since then.  
@_date: 2017-07-27 18:00:40
Debatable?  Lulz
@_date: 2019-05-17 16:48:03
I'd imagine your loaded, inflammatory question made it seem unlikely that engaging you would be worthwhile.
@_date: 2017-05-17 14:38:36
Chris, could you help us out and signal UASF bip148?  Thanks.
@_date: 2019-05-17 16:50:50
Reported you for violating r/bitcoin rules.  Now please go cry about censorship on r/btc.
@_date: 2019-05-30 20:41:39
But he switched to BCH, not fiat.  So I'd agree with you if by 'some' you mean terrible.
@_date: 2017-07-29 13:27:56
I'm sure that's what some of them imagined they were doing.

Yep, wasn't worthwhile.
