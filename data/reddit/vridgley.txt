To answer the second part of your question the Futures are used as a hedge against the future price of something, so if you purchase the future for example the future while $11,000, your contract with CME is for five of them which has a base rate of $55,000. Assume you hold your future for one month or until some date prior to the expiration of your contract and you sell it when Bitcoin is at $12,300 that would give UA basis of $61,500.
Now you get into the actual future itself. Because each Bitcoin is $5 base and the contract is made up of five of them each incremental move and the Bitcoin is worth $25 up or down. What I don't know off the top of my head is what that incremental movement is if the incremental movement is say one tick equals $100 your Bitcoin moved 12.3 ticks. You then multiply 12.3 * 25 to establish what your gain is. Then you have to factor in your clearing firms Commission and the exchange fees and whatever your leftover with is your profit.

As of disclaimer I have to say upfront that I work for CQG.  We are the second oldest Market data vendor to Thomson Reuters and one of the largest ISVs in the world hosting more than 120 FCMs on 90 exchanges. 
Now that that is out of the way. CME Bitcoin Futures are going to be just that Futures So you're going to  be betting on what the future price of the Bitcoin will be it has absolutely no bearing on the price of Bitcoin itself. The symbol that CME is going to use is BRR.  
Business Insider has a pretty decent article that you might want to check out.

It certainly doesn't help when you have Junior Developers who don't understand what they're doing with code and turn around Wipeout multi-link security keys for digital wallets and end up wiping out 300 million dollars worth of cryptocurrency that will never be recoverable

Shorting Bitcoin would require you to have the belief that it's going to go down. Futures don't allow for Investments that pay out in a percentage is the underlined product goes down.  I'm not at Liberty to give any recommendations as I'm not a broker but I am regulated that being said if you're unfamiliar with the Futures industry there are better Investments to cut your teeth on. I've seen people lose a house in a day
