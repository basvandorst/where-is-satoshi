What you should do is bury bitcoins in some parts of the world. Add a background plugin that uses some of the extra processing power to mine altocoins

Well friends, it must be true....some random guy on the internet guaranteed it

Problem is the scrypt asics are coming soon...

Sounds like no one figured out they could play minecraft for a living

Just letting you know: 'from BITCOIN; 'I am the one who knocks'

Ok fair enough. What about an open source compiler? Wouldn't it be resistant to backdoors?
@_date: 2014-02-18 01:32:35
Its solid for daytrading
@_date: 2014-01-01 17:59:54
Well maybe that's the problem. Why not have a standard opensource compiler?
@_date: 2014-01-01 04:34:32
The compiled binary can be hash checked against identical binaries compiled from other compilers. If differences are found the bad compiler can be identified

So extract the firmware and decode it and publish it. Or inject your own firmware
@_date: 2013-12-20 21:40:08
Oh you mean inject instructions to virtual hardware simulated on a beowulf cluster? That would be amusing to watch. How exactly would remote commands be executed through a hardware backdoor if the vm is running on virtual hardware and the drivers for the network cards are not installed on the hypervisor?
@_date: 2013-12-21 19:23:19
How so? It would be open season on finding it, and if there were multiple organizations NOT in the same country then what you suggest is impossible 
@_date: 2013-12-21 06:28:58
If the drivers for the network device are installed on the virtual machine and not the hypervisor or host os, and you are emulating an entire virtual hardware configuration, it is impossible for remote commands to actually interface with the real physical hardware without getting past the virtual environment.

Ban the word ban!

And people always look at me like an idiot when I talk about how cool nested virtualization is. Imagine getting through consecutive encrypted layers of virtualization without tripping any wires...trying to map the ram of a compromised system that contains unknown virtual ram cache honeypots while attempting to recognize virtual elements to even realize you are in a vm ....yeah. it would be like walking across a football field that has like 100000 landmines randomly placed...now imagine that only with encryption separating each layer. Now imagine successful walking across that field 3 times in a row.....each time the mines switch places. Lol

The way you fix it: create crowdfunded organizations that provide cash rewards for holes/backdoors found in very important open source software source code.
