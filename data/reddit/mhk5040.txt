No, put your money in ETH and XRP imo.

I don't agree with their solution.. but I will try to explain it simply. Think of these channels as a starting point. Party  pays X to initiate an off-block ledger. Party  and  are than able to make an unlimited amount of payments while the ledger remains open. However, once Party  signs the ledger, the block is netted out and a singular transaction is posted to the blockchain, thus finalizing the 50-100 micro-transactions into one lump settlement payment. The money that you commit to the channel is like a reservation fee. I do not like this solution because it lacks security - any transaction that is performed off of the blockchain can be disputed, Party  can choose not to sign the ledger, or the ledger could be electronically tampered with.

you should look into it again, they have casper coming. It is a better technical soultion than BTC's lightning network and has more developers behind the project. You should research it again. I will say that you are correct in the fact that crpytokitties stressed the network, once again, I employ you to look at the incoming technical soultion, casper, and its designer vitalik buterin

Buy the dip Baby! 
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:18:25
Lol.... BTC still has 87153 Unconfirmed Transactions.... the dip has not stopped, people are starting to realize how bad the tech is. Bitcoin is like AOL. (hahaha negitive 23 points... don't say that people didn't warn you)

wasn't a bad name at all &lt;3 you thought I was a liar at the time... truthfully I don't know which source is better, Pipdotcom's seems fairly authoritative.... but idk.

I never bought a cent, I was too late, by the time I found out about it - it had already turned to shitcoin.. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:05:56
yoooo where is my fucking moon? you all promised me at least 3 moons, start buying chumps!

BTC has only a fraction of the market share that it is intending on capturing, all these coins do. Scalability is an issue for every single one of them and there are a lot of solutions being proposed in white papers (security and performance being the other two). BTC network is clogged now? Imagine how bad it will be when there is mass market adaption. If you are hloding BTC right now, you better believe in their solutions, ie lightning network. If you don't even know what that is (not you asdn1220) than you are an idiot for investing in BTC in the first place imo
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:31:53
Yet another reason why I think it is a bad solution. All my money is now in ETH
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:23:44
its strength was undeniable. banks and governments hate it and are working with other organizations. it is all about control and BTC is to 'free' and consumes too much energy to be viable on a large scale. if you hodl BTC you will get gains and the price will increase quicker than the S&amp;P, but I think you will see better results in other opportunities that have better tech and support

BTC is slowly bleeding, wait till the new year for the bull to return, memes in the meantime: 
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:42:27
sorry about that, I went by  - I thought that was bitcoin only, but now I think that it is for all blockchains. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:41:36
