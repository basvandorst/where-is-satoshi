Truth is that a couple of banks were investors in Coinbase. It's amazing that banks believe in Bitcoin to invest in Coinbase. Saying "Coinbase is funded by banksters crooks" is FUD, because you are trying to instill fear, uncertainty, and doubt that Coinbase is controlled by the banks and that we are evil.

I don't know exactly how bitfinex implemented their multisig, so I am just taking an educated guess. But it sounds like the hacker got access to the user key to sign the transaction and then sent it over to BitGo to have it signed. So 2 failures: Bitfinex did not properly secure the user key and BitGo did not properly limit withdrawal velocity.
For Coinbase multisig vaults, the shared key is only stored in encrypted form. So Coinbase needs to first ask the user for the passphrase to decrypt the key in the browser. Then it's signed by Coinbase. Coinbase can never unilaterally spend the coins in the multisig vault. The user also has a user key that Coinbase has no access to.

That's not true. Orders were canceled in both cases where it benefits Coinbase or the user. The fraud detection algorithm is not dependent on price movements. But only people who lost out would come here to complain. People who benefited would happily stay quiet. So you got the wrong impression that it only benefited Coinbase.
@_date: 2016-04-29 15:47:37
We stopped doing it because we realized how disruptive it was. See explanation above on why we didn't do it to benefit us. So we tweaked the fraud algorithm to be able to figure out potential fraudulent buys sooner. There are still false positives where legitimate buys are canceled, but at least the buyer will be told right away.

He's using a vault and not a multisig vault. Therefore, the coin movements were off blockchain. That's why there's a need to protect against a bug in the off blockchain accounting bug. If everything was on chain, then there would be double spend protection. So this doesn't affect the multisig vault.

We are more or less in agreement about the block size proposal, but coming from a different angle. We both think that we need to be very conservative about the block size increase. I'm more concerned about the larger blocksize causing decreasing in security and decentralization. And Bobby is concerned about the blockchain bloat causing individuals to not able to run Bitcoin nodes.
We are both against BIP101, as we feel like it's way too aggressive and dangerous.
We will be at Scaling Bitcoin.
Definitely no on *-RBF. I do think RBF may be inevitable in the future when block rewards approach zero. Miners at that time may want to squeeze as much fees as possible out of each block. By then, we will have stuff like liquid networks that can fulfill the need for zero-conf. But the time is not now. Why destroy the usefulness of zero-conf today?
I fully agree with Erik Vorhees: 
@_date: 2015-12-21 20:52:14
Send an email to Coinbase support and let us know. We can help investigate. Also you won't get a verification code unless your username/password has been submitted correctly. So you may want to first change your password.
@_date: 2015-12-03 02:27:55
Yes, I did. The blocksize debate is showing why this is true. Bitcoin's security/decentralization is not a once size fits all solution. Coffee purchases don't need to be stored on a network that has billions of dollars in mining hashrate security and tens of thousands of decentralized nodes verifying that transaction. Coffee buyers cannot afford to pay the fee required to be on this network, and they don't need that much security and decentralization for that small purchase. But if you are buying a car or a house, of course, you would want the transaction to be secured on the native Bitcoin blockchain. For smaller purchases, other solutions can work: altcoins, sidechains, payment channels, lightning networks, and offchain solutions. We just need to abstract this away from end users. So they don't know or care if their transactions is on the native Bitcoin blockchain or on any of the other alternatives. It needs to just work.
@_date: 2018-09-21 05:13:35


Exchanges (even if not upgraded) won't accept coins with only 1 confirmation. Since &gt;51% hashrate has upgraded, it's unlikely for an invalid transaction to have multiple confirmations before being overrun by the longer correct chain that orphans the bad block.
@_date: 2015-12-03 01:41:14
Let me comment on the different RBFs:
Full-RBF: This is just bad. Why let the sender send to a different address? The only use case is to double spend. Sure, it may be inevitable in the future as selfish miners will accept them. But why shoot ourselves in the foot today?
OptIn-RBF: This is safer, but it requires everyone to understand this new flag. Otherwise, you will get burned. All merchants and payment processors will now have to act differently when that flag is set. A face-to-face local bitcoin buyer can get scammed if their mobile wallet does not know about this new flag. This adds a lot of pain to the whole ecosystem for very little gains IMO. Child Pays For Parents solves all the need for RBF.
FirstSeenSafe-RBF: I don't mind this option as much. As long as the same recipient (outputs) get the same amount of money, there's no chance of anyone getting defrauded. It's just more work on miner and some more complexity in the code. I follow the KISS principles and think that the benefits does not outweigh the added complexity.
SE-RBF: what is this?

Probably best to ask Coinbase support. Sorry.


I keep most of my LTC in cold storage. I only keep coins that I actively trade on exchanges. I would definitely recommend taking coins off the exchange if you are not going to trade them in the near future. It only takes a few minutes to get coins onto the exchange when you do need to trade them. Remember that sending LTC to an exchange is faster than sending BTC. :D
@_date: 2015-12-03 20:33:08
I think BIP101's increase is too aggressive. An immediate increase to 4MB might be ok, though it's hard to say for sure. I would prefer an immediate increase to 2MB, maybe something like the 2-4-8 proposal.
As for Litecoin, remember that Litecoin's security/decentralization requirements are different than Bitcoin's. It's ok for Litecoin to be a less secure and less decentralized network when compared to Bitcoin. So larger blocks is less dangerous for Litecoin than for Bitcoin. By dangerous, I'm referring to the fact that it can destroy 2 of the key features of bitcoin: highly secure and decentralized.
@_date: 2015-12-03 19:37:56
At the time when I created Litecoin (4+ years ago), block size issue was not on anyone's mind. I paid absolutely no attention to the blocksize cap and whether or not I needed to change it. That said, I don't know if a 4MB block (effectively) is dangerous. I do believe a relative quick increase to GB blocks is very dangerous.

The math is of course simplified. The cost is not all paid before winning the block. Some costs (storage and orphan) are paid after mining the block. So the miner needs to make an educated guess on the marginal cost (to him) of adding a transaction. This cost is still less than the the cost on the whole network.

Makes sense. No one know what the future holds. We can only act on our best guess. Mine is that we should err on valuing security and decentralization. And yours is to err on transaction throughput and lower fees.

Bitcoin is money, currency, property, and commodity: 
@_date: 2015-12-16 06:01:03
No matter how large a transaction volume, you will still need a minimum fee to block out uneconomical transactions. Otherwise, as I argued in the blog post, miners will mine them selfishly and cause the network to go towards less security and decentralization.
Although lightening networks takes fees away from miners, the fees that they are taking away are transactions that Bitcoin cannot support. LN still settles on the blockchain and will give a lot of fees to miners when that happens. The other good thing about LN is that LN will give fees to relay nodes. These relay nodes will help the decentralization of Bitcoin. There's finally a way to incentivize Bitcoin nodes that are not miners.
@_date: 2015-12-03 02:14:37
I agree with Bobby. Private blockchains are not that interesting to me. Maybe they are marginally better than what we previously had, shared databases. It's not revolutionary like Bitcoin.
My options about BitcoinXT is here: 
@_date: 2015-12-03 20:17:05
Exactly. Starbuck itself can have an offchain/sidechain network to handle all their transactions. There's no need to pay the fees required for these relatively tiny transactions to be on the Bitcoin blockchain.

I believe that LN will be a better place for low value Bitcoin transactions. And I've said this many times. Why would I say that if I just wanted to pump Litecoin?

**This is Charlie Lee, Director of Engineering at Coinbase**
I won't comment on the account ban for privacy or regulatory reasons. But I can say that the ban has nothing to do with this person's hackerone reporting. And unfortunately, we cannot be more lenient on him just because he has previously helped us. The 2 issues are independent. And plus, the team that works with banning has no access or knowledge of the hackerone cases. This separation protects our customers' privacy.
As for the hackerone reports, we've looked into it more. Here's the summary of the exploit:
1. User has a vault with 2 BTC and a wallet with 0 BTC.
2. User withdraws 2 BTC from his vault to his wallet.
3. Withdrawal clears. (vault: 0 BTC, wallet: 2 BTC)
4. User withdraws 2 BTC from wallet to an external address. (vault: 0 BTC, wallet: 0 BTC)
5. Bug allowed user to cancel the previously cleared vault withdrawal. (vault: 2 BTC, wallet: -2 BTC)
6. User can now withdraw 2 BTC from vault to a 2nd wallet. (vault: 0 BTC, wallet: -2 BTC, wallet-b: 2 BTC)
On the surface, it looks like an infinite btc withdrawal bug. In reality, we have protection in place to prevent us from losing money due to all bugs similar to this one. I actually coded this myself years ago when we started allowing multiple accounts per user. The protection is such that if user has ANY account that has a negative value, we will block ANY external sends. So from this point on with a negative wallet balance, he's not able to send any money off site from any other of his accounts. Hence he thought he had a "secret ban" put on his account. In reality, he triggered a protection we put in place to prevent us from losing money.
The other thing to note is that, at no point, was the user able to withdraw externally more coins than he actually owned. The sum of all his account balances is never negative for this exploit. He was able to withdraw his own coins. It's true that he now still had a positive balance in an account, but there was no way he could have withdrawn those coins externally. He had to first deposit coins to set his negative wallet balance positive first.
To be honest, awarding this exploit $5000 was more than fair, if you ask me.
P.S. Apparently, the best time to throw mud at Coinbase is on a Sunday when everyone is not working. :P

As far as the 2nd exploit, it's not an exploit as it cannot be reproduced. Your steps do not make sense as you mention approve a vault deposit. Vault deposits never needs approval. Like I said, we will publish both reports. People will see that the 2nd report's scenario is very similar to the first report. The bounds of loss is the same.

Anyone can freely buy the crypto that they believe in. And they can freely express their opinion about what they believe in. Conflict of interest only matters when the person is in power to change things and has an interested to change things for the worse to benefit himself. I'm not in that position. If I were running for the board member position of the Bitcoin foundation, maybe you can argue for conflict of interest, and I will concede that.

Why is there a need for multiples of anything? Why Pepsis when we already have Coke? Why Facebook when there's already MySpace? Why Google when there's already Yahoo? Of course, I'm not trying to say that Litecoin is poised to overtake Bitcoin. The point is, people like choices. There are some differences that some people will choose to use an alternative to Bitcoin. Litecoin also has a separate set of developers than Bitcoin. We are not bound by the politics of Bitcoin and can go in a separate direction. And also, Litecoin has different security, speed, and fees when compared to Bitcoin. So certain transactions may be better suited for the Litecoin network given those properties.
The market decides which coins go away and which coins stay. Even I couldn't destroy Litecoin if I tried today. And the market decides how much these coins will inflate away Bitcoin.

No, SegWit if deployed and used, will make today's 1MB block effectively like 4MBs. With 2-4-8, at 8MB block, it's effectively 32MB, which is enough to have LN support 1/4 billion users. That's more than enough in the next 4 years.
As we learn more in the next 4 years, we can tweak it more. Maybe LN can be even more efficient. Or maybe 8MB is too much. No one knows right now.

By design, early adopters of a crypto-currency definitely were able to mine the coins easier and buy the coins at the cheaper price. They have more to gain but also more to lose if the coin fails. Early, there was no guarantee that Bitcoin or Litecoin would succeed. You could easily have lost all your money. And early adopters have done more in promoting the currency and teach others about it. So I think it's still fair. This is true also when you think about early employees of a startup. Sure, they have more shares but they also risked a lot more joining early and did more to help the startup achieve success than employees joining later on.
I don't think ASICs are necessarily bad for Bitcoin or Litecoin. They help better secure the coin and a potential decrease in decentralization.

Though you provided no clear steps to reproduce or proof of exploit, we initially gave you the benefit of the doubt and reviewed with both our security and engineering teams to try and creatively reproduce but could not.  Further, your account had been banned for activities unrelated to your security work which would have precluded even you from testing this "exploit".  Even with these factors aside, there's still no indication that you are, or were able to make wallet balances not go negative.  Since neither you nor us were able to reproduce any issue here, and you declined to provide further context when requested, we stand behind closing this issue.

Potentially. The worldwide transaction volume will not all be on Bitcoin or a couple networks. It will be handled by dozens of networks.

Some will have low fees, fast transactions, and less security and decentralization like Lightning Network. And there will be many in between. You will use whichever fits your needs.

His hack left his account in a state where he can't withdraw externally. This protection was in place to prevent us losing a lot of money. So that explains his inability to withdraw. A feature and not a bug.

Crypto is still too hard to use. Companies like Coinbase is trying to change that. Once using crypto is as easy as using your credit card or cash, then adoption will increase dramatically. Volatility of the price will need to come down too. And that will come with time.

We try not to pre-announce projects. Sorry! But we are working on some cool stuff. :D


About 2-3 years behind. Litecoin is drafting behind Bitcoin waiting for the last lap! :P


I like to see a bit more of everything: more wallets, more exchanges (yeah, I know), more atms, more merchants, more services, etc.


If I tell you, I will have to ...


Not really.


I don't see us as competing. I think Bobby and I can do more for crypto-currency working at the 2 largest crypto companies and pushing crypto forward on opposite sides of the world... rather than working at the same company.

It's just a generalization to get the point across. Do you think the average reader would be better off if I dove into the details and broke down the cost to the penny? How does that help? Any more complicated than that, the reader will be lost. The point is that a decentralized system costs more than a centralized system because it requires decentralization. I think I got the point across.

Please understand what conflict of interest means. EVERYONE acts in their best interest. There's no conflict in that. And that's not wrong in any way. It's only a conflict of interest if someone is in a position of power and has an interest that is against what he has control of.
Being director of engineering at Coinbase does not give me control of Bitcoin. I can try to influence Bitcoin by talking about it, but that's all I can do.

Starting another coin doesn't mean you can force the market to accept. You cannot force inflation. If the market agrees to the inflation, then it will happen. Whereas for fiat, the government forces inflation on everyone. That's a key difference.

Brian just wants a solution. He's not set on which specifically. But trying to push the community towards consensus. Since BIP101 seemed to be the only one that was ready, he used that as an example.
If we supported the industry letter, we would have signed it initially. We didn't because we weren't all sold on BIP101 and this sentence was just wrong: "BIP101 and 8MBblocks are already supported by a majority of the miners and we feel it is time for the industry to unite behind this proposal."

What's your question? LOL
@_date: 2015-12-20 22:58:38
But you do agree that the exploit (if even called that) only lets you withdraw coins you already owned. You could not cause any harm to Coinbase. It just looks like you could due to an bad internal transaction and a display error.
To re-iterate, the $5000 payout for the first report was more than fair. In hindsight, I would not have paid that much due to it not being money losing at all.
I do apologize for it taking so long to resolve and for the unrelated account ban affecting your ability to help prove this further.

See my reply about 4mb blocks.
Everyone acts in their best interest in mind. That is not news. But the great thing about crypto is that you can put money where your mouth is. If you don't believe Bitcoin can scale, you can bet on Litecoin's price rising. 
My creating and investing money in Litecoin is because I know Bitcoin cannot scale to handle ALL the transaction needs of the world. It's not the opposite where after investing in Litecoin, I'm actively trying to sabotage Bitcoin to make it not scale. It's silly if you believe I'm doing the latter.
@_date: 2015-12-03 02:10:58
I did not say that all were not launched fairly. I0coin was a attempt to launch Ixcoin fairly and Fairbrix did that for Tenebrix. I still hold the view that a lot of coins were attempts to strike it rich for the creator. And that's stupid, and also a large reason why the coin failed. Thousands of coins copied from Litecoin, but I don't know one that fully copied Litecoin's fair launch: pre-release of source code and brinary, vote of launch date, and a config change to switch miner to main net at launch time.

I was talking about the 2nd report. The scenario is exactly like the first. Positive vault balance, negative wallet balance, and you withdrew coins you own and cannot withdraw coins you don't own.
There was no reason for us to ban you to prevent you from proving your exploit. It's an unfortunate coincidence.
We will publish both hackerone reports when we've reviewed to make sure there's nothing sensitive in them. Thanks.

I think this argument is silly. Why would miners (a business) spend $1 to earn $0.5 in bitcoin today and hope that in a few years, it will be 10x the money. Why not just not mine and buy $1 worth of bitcoin and make twice as much! Do you think gold miners will mine gold at a loss? "Hey let's keep our gold mine running. Even though it costs us $2000 to mine an ounce of gold, gold will be worth $20,000 in a few years!"

The attacker would also need your 2fa and would need you to ignore all the notifications (via email and sms) for 2 days telling you that you have a withdrawal in process.
But yeah, in the unlikely scenario that this happens, they will be able to steal your coins.
@_date: 2014-12-01 01:31:21
Sorry that this upset you so much. The truth was what we told you. The bug has been reported previously and we were working on the fix since it was first found. True, it was a relatively simple fix. But put our code through rigorous testing before releasing it. So that takes time. It was just random timing that we happened to release the fix 30 minutes after you reported.
It's true that we could release an emergency bug fix in 30 minutes. But we only do this for real urgent bug fixes, like if there was a money losing bug. The bug you found was not an urgent fix, and it would have been stupid for us to push that fix out without at least a few days of testing.
@_date: 2015-12-17 01:18:06
People keep throwing conflict of interest around. Everyone has their own interests and act based on that. Nothing wrong with that for people to be selfish. Heck, Bitcoin is built on this principle. That even if everyone is selfish, the system still works.
I'm not in a position of power w.r.t. Bitcoin direction. I can only post my opinion and people can take it however they want. That's not a conflict of interest. Plus, at least, I'm open about it. Maybe the next person writing a piece against BIP101/XT has a ton of litecoins, but no one knows. The beauty of crypto-currency is that you can put your money where your mouth is. You can even create your own crypto and convince others to use it.
Lastly, you got the cause and effect wrong. I didn't create Litecoin and now try to handicap Bitcoin so Litecoin succeeds. I created Litecoin BECAUSE I thought Bitcoin would have scaling issues. People always criticizes Litecoin by saying that Litecoin is not silver because 0.01 BTC is silver. You can always send less BTC. My response has not changed since I created Litecoin: wait until Bitcoin transaction fees become too much for you to send $3 for coffee.

Litecoin copied the best parts from the previous altcoins but none of the bad things. I got the idea that I can do a better job at a new altcoin. Here are the key features that helped Litecoin succeed:
- Good name
- Good marketing (Silver to Bitcoin's Gold)
- Faster block times
- Different mining algorithm (Scrypt) so to not compete with Bitcoin miners
- Fair launch
@_date: 2014-12-11 06:15:34
Fair enough. You make a good point. Testing whether or not an email belongs to a Coinbase user is useful to hackers. But keep in mind that phishing attacks no longer work with Coinbase users due to our device verification protection.
Our team is going to spend some time thinking about this and see if we can block this and still provide a good UX for users. I just told our engineers that they can't take Christmas off. Thanks eof!

Peter, this is the first time I have heard of this problem. Thanks for bringing this to our attention in such a public and sensationalist manner. You could have just emailed me and let me know. You know my email address.
You said that you mentioned this to us 1.5 years ago and we haven't fixed it since. Well 1.5 years ago, Coinbase only had 1 employee (Olaf) outside the two founders. They were likely too busy keeping the company alive to fix this compatibility issue. So it's not surprising that this has slipped their minds.
Anyways, we have located the bug and a fix is checked in and will be deployed soon after it has been well-tested.
@_date: 2014-12-09 19:25:21
This is indeed what happened. 'New User' was not actually saved in the database. It was defaulted to that if you never changed your display name. Earlier this year, we added the concept of legal name and defaulted everyone's display name to their legal name if they haven't changed it. We didn't think of the scenario where someone actually like the 'New User' name and wanted to keep that for privacy reasons.
We are very sorry that this happened. Sometimes it's hard to think through all the implications of a simple change like that. I will make sure we spend more time thinking through privacy issues in the future. Thanks for bringing this up to us.

I disagree and FWIW, Gavin is an advisor to Coinbase.
@_date: 2014-10-29 19:41:57
The shared key is encrypted and only the user has the passphrase.
@_date: 2014-12-10 03:03:44
We don't have enumeration of emails. Though we do give out your display name and username (if set) if another Coinbase user sends you some bitcoin via your email address. An attacker needs to already have your email address. With it, they can figure out if you are a Coinbase user or not. But since phishing costs the attacker nothing, this information is not that useful. They can just send out a Coinbase phishing email to all email addresses for free. And if you happen to be a Coinbase user, then great. If not, nothing lost.
To my knowledge, we have never exposed user email addresses to someone who didn't already have your email address. The reason why a bunch of people got phished earlier this year is because a list of email addresses got leaked from some database dump of other Bitcoin sites. I do remember MtGox had a leak like this. So it was easy for a attacker to try to phish those user's password and 2fa token. To combat this security hole, we implemented device verification via email, which protects users from being phished.
That said, we are constantly reviewing our security practices. It's always a tradeoff between ease of use versus security.
P.S. Since your attack came in June, were you not protected by device verification?
@_date: 2015-12-16 06:55:34
Miners cannot add transactions after he mined a block. But he can choose which transactions he puts into the block. For example, if he sees a transaction paying no fees at all, he can just throw it away instead of spending cpu cycles verifying that the signature is correct and that it correctly spends a UTXO. He also saves cost by not keeping it around in memory, relaying to other nodes, and saving it to harddisk.
@_date: 2014-11-28 03:14:12
Coinbase is not leaking emails addresses. There has been multiple hacked exchanges including MtGox. So bitcoin user emails/passwords are out there. We see people trying these leaked credentials via tor to try log in to Coinbase all the time.

First of all, my coblee email address is public, so most people can find it in 15 seconds. Here's a challenge, try to figure out my email for my primary account coinbase.com/charlie.
Secondly, no one said we won't fix this bug. It is not a critical security issue, but it's important enough that we will fix it. 
Lastly, if you do try to phish Coinbase users, you will find that you are going to have a hard time stealing money from users even if you phished their email, password, AND 2fa token.
We've constantly made improvements to protect our users. We will close every security hole, including this one.

We're not perfect, but I really like the way Coinbase does things and that's why I joined them. We are as transparent as possible because, like you said, there's nothing to lose in doing so. And we don't pre-announce features until they are ready, because there's nothing to gain in doing so.
@_date: 2014-10-29 19:37:24
Yes, there's definitely a tradeoff for the convenience. If you know what you are doing and want cold storage, you would choose doing your own paper wallets over using the Coinbase multisig vault.
@_date: 2014-11-29 00:56:39
If you put the coins in the multisig vault, you are safe from Coinbase going down and government seizures. Of course, there is a security risk during withdrawal if you go through Coinbase instead of the offline open source multisig tool, as malicious code (from malware or government) can be injected into the javascript to steal your coins. But this attack vector is pretty small as it can only steal from you when you are withdrawing. So if anyone's coins get stolen this way, people will hear about it, and you can safely withdraw without going through Coinbase.
@_date: 2014-12-21 19:07:46
I wasn't at Coinbase when the decision was made to implement Bitcoin Ruby, so I can't comment on why we did that.  This whole Bitcoin thing is an experimentation. I think having multiple implementations of the consensus code is actually a good thing and helps make Bitcoin anti-fragile. 
@_date: 2014-07-23 19:07:16
The vault is more for user security than Coinbase security. This helps prevent phishing attacks and email takeover attacks from cleaning out your account.
@_date: 2014-07-23 19:05:36

Coinbase's multisig vault solution is similar to cold storage but has a few differences:
* Easier to withdraw money, as it's an extra password on top of Coinbase log in
* Harder to screw up and lose everything.
* Due to the online nature, more susceptible to javascript injection and malware

I am very excited about BTC China adding Litecoin trading to their site. BTC China's decision to support Litecoin reinforces the fact that Litecoin is the most popular alternative to Bitcoin and Bitcoin/Litecoin is the 1-2 punch of crypto-currency.
As we have seen with the recent MtGox disaster, a competent and trusted exchange is very important for the health of a crypto-currency like Bitcoin and Litecoin. BTC China is a venture-backed company with a history of secure and safe practices. Unlike a lot of other crypto companies, BTC China is run by competent and non-anonymous individuals. I know because my brother, Bobby Lee, happens to be the CEO of BTC China. :)
Bobby has also committed to me a matching challenge donation of 1000 LTC to the Litecoin development fund. Details to follow. It shows that BTC China believes in the future of Litecoin and wants to support the development and health of Litecoin. BTC China also recognizes that what's good for Litecoin is also good for Bitcoin as we contribute substantive bug fixes to Bitcoin and our ability to experiment faster helps advance the state of the art of crypto-currency.
BTC China joins a myriad of recent announcements of Litecoin support from exchanges, payment processors, and merchants. The future of Litecoin is as bright as it has ever been. I am extremely excited!

Unfortunately, not much. If your computer is compromised at the time you are creating your multisig vault, the hacker would be able to get your backup keys and your credentials. This is also the case if you are creating a paper wallet.
And if your computer is compromised when you are doing a withdrawal, the attacker would have access to your passphrase. But they wouldn't able to steal from your account, because they still would need your 2fa tokens. Malware and phishing sites do still pose a problem. So that is why the 48 hour delay is useful. We will keep notifying you via email and SMS over that 2 day period, and you can cancel the withdrawal.
EDIT: See Brian's comment about group vaults below.
@_date: 2014-08-22 18:06:27
The problem is that we had to send the user that dust txns in order for them to send out. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 00:16:20
It used to be bad to do this, because you would have coins that are added to your available balance that you can't send out. Your transaction will be stuck pending. But earlier this year, I fixed it so that unconfirmed coins are not added to your available balance, so this is no longer an issue. I'd say, go for it! :)

To spend coins, you need all 3 public keys. But only need 2 seeds to sign a transaction. If you don't have all 3, you can't generate the transaction. So you definitely should backup the xpubkeys.
@_date: 2014-12-21 19:02:18
Gavin is against this also IIRC. Having multiple implementations is better. Yes, some will have bugs and may reject valid transactions. And when that happens as in this case, it will be fixed and very little pain. If everyone relied on one implementation, then a single bug can take the whole system down. I don't see why that's better

Tell me why the coinbase tip button makes it worse for everyone else? Is it because you need a coinbase wallet? But for people that tip, they don't need a coinbase wallet.

Coinbase warns users with a high balance to use 2fa if 2fa is not turned on. And even if user does not have 2fa and has a weak password, their account is still protected by device verification via email.

This is Charlie from Coinbase.
We will look to provide configurable clearing time in the future. For now, we think 48 hrs is a good compromise. Remember that you don't need to contact customer support to cancel a vault withdrawal. We send notification to the email(s) and phone number(s) associate with the vault. So even if your email and coinbase account get hacked and the hacker changed the phone number on your coinbase account, you will still get an SMS sent to YOUR phone. And that SMS will contain a link (that does not require logging in) that will cancel the withdrawal.
Thanks for the feedback. We will definitely look into more ways to safely secure the vault. And we have a good process against social engineering attacks because we realize that account reset process is the weakest link in any online secured website.

onename.io seems to be down. They provide other useful things like linking your social profiles to your onename. As far as Bitcoin payments, Coinbase's solution is much better as it generates a different unique bitcoin address for each payment. So your privacy is preserved and people can still send you payments anonymously.

Coins are indeed assigned to users. But every hour, we sweep them to cold storage. So before they are swept, you will spend coins assigned to you if possible.

I think Bitcoin is an experiment, but it doesn't mean I treat Coinbase as an experiment. I don't disagree that starting a startup with Bitcoin core is less risky and less work than writing Bitcoin Ruby, but like I said I did not make that decision. But it's definitely a lot of work and risky to switch to Bitcoin core today.

Let me start off by saying I'm not trying to bash them, just trying to clear up why I was not lying.
Various people have told me that their code has not changed over the past year and that they have left security holes unfixed. Others have said that they have mis-signed transactions causing coins to be lost.
I was not lying when I made that statement. Keonne came out and said that they have indeed made fixes, so I retracted those statements as I was misinformed. I don't think I was being dishonest.

I think this is for protection of NY residents. If someone has not accessed their account for 5 years, then it becomes lost property and NY will take possession and figure out how to handle the money.
Not accessing it for 5 years means you don't log in for 5 years and have not even checked the balance. So leaving coins in the vault for 5 years is ok as long as you log in to you account once every 5 years. If you plan on not logging in in 5 years, then I don't know what to say. :)
That said, the NY DFS proposal is still being refined.

Having 48 hours delay does not guarantee that the reserves can't be touched. It just means that a run on the bank is delayed by 48 hours. It's not like this is a 6 month COD. The 2 day delay also gives enough time to get coins from cold storage if necessary.
So I don't see how you connect this to fractional reserve. If a company wanted to run a fractional reserve, having something like this vault does not really make that easier. MtGox didn't have something like this and they were basically running a fractional reserve.

Let's just say it was impossible (or really really hard) to get Coinbase to support Litecoin on the old backend that was specific to Bitcoin.

After the coin is swept, to spend them we create 2 transactions. One from the hot wallet back to your addresses and one from your address to wherever you wanted to send them. 
The reason why we are making it so complicated is because people tend to send coins back to the sender address. So we want to make sure that the sender address always belong to you. Otherwise coins sent back will be lost. It was a design decision made 2 years ago. In hindsight, maybe we should have designed things a different way. We are doing a redesign right now and are thinking about better ways to handle this.

Another problem that I just fixed yesterday was related to sending below min dust amount of 5460 satoshi. As you may know, if you send an output of less than 5460 satoshi, that transaction might never be mined (even if you put in a fee) as it would be considered dust. Dust was initially set to 5430 satoshi ( but then later changed to 5460 satoshi.
The problem was due to our hotwallet/coldstorage architecture. A user may have balance stored in the hot wallet. So in order to send a transaction out, they might need to restore some balance from the hot wallet first. So 2 transactions are sent out at the same time. A transaction to restore from the hot wallet back to the user wallet and another transaction that spends the restore transaction and sends it externally. The problem happens when the user has less than the min dust amount in the hot wallet. If they try to send all their coins out, the restore from hot wallet transaction will have an output of less than 5460 satoshi and that transaction will either take forever to be mined or it may never be mined. So the send to external transaction that depends on this one will be stuck also.
The fix was to actually send min dust more than they need to them so that the first transaction is good. And then second transaction will just return min dust to their account. See this example.
First transaction: 
Second transaction:

Coinbase wallet was available to everyone since day one. Only the buy/sell portion was US-only initially and now Europe.
You don't have to use Coinbase to tip a Coinbase tip button, but it's definitely a lot easier. And if you choose to send via another wallet, you can send any amount you want. Not sure how that's not the best of both worlds.
@_date: 2014-11-28 02:14:28
Online wallets help you send and receive transactions. So I don't see why you think its wrong that they can see your transactions.
If you are using a wallet that's client side, there's always a chance that the online wallet can let you download new javascript that spies on you.
And if you are using a totally local solution, then it is not really an online wallet anymore. 
@_date: 2014-08-22 18:05:02

This is Charlie Lee from Coinbase.
Thanks for explaining the situation. This is exactly what happens. Our fraud detection algorithm does not look at price movements. Having a plan to screw over your customers is not a very smart business plan. And if it was the way we make money, I don't think Andreessen Horowitz would invest in us.
Unfortunately, our fraud detection is not perfect. And it errs on the cautious side to protect our losses. Sometimes innocent people get caught in the net and we rely on support to try to figure it out. And obviously, support does not get it right 100% of the time. We've actually had fraudsters posting on reddit complaining about this and they sound like innocent users. And after we pushed their buys through, they then scam us. So it's really hard to tell. When support cannot be certain, they just rely on the automated detection.
We definitely could do a better job though. In this case, if someone has already done $1000 purchase and no issues, it's highly unlikely that they will scam us for $70. And it's just as unlikely we would scam them for $70. :)

On  "No fees for the first $1,000,000 of bitcoin payments, after that just 1% to instantly convert bitcoin to cash."
So there's only a fee to convert bitcoin to cash. I work at Coinbase, so I know it to be true. This means that we need to make this more clear on our website and blog posts. If you are just accepting bitcoins, you get the bitcoins for no fee.

@_date: 2014-07-30 19:37:31
You are mistaken. With Coinbase, the first $1 million in fiat conversion is free. If you keep the Bitcoin instead of converting it to USD, it's free forever, as there's only a fee (after first $1 million) to convert to USD.
My point was that for small merchants, who would not do $1 million in transactions for a long time, the Coinbase plan is effectively the same as the BitPay free plan. For large merchants (Expedia, CheapAir, Dell, Overstock, Dish, etc.), who would do over $1 million in sales, they would choose between Coinbase's plan or BitPay's Enterprise plan.

The vault launched today does not do multi-sig. We have plans to do real multi-sig where Coinbase does not have control of the majority of the keys. But do realize that real multi-sig would not be able to take advantage of our cold storage AND the user would have to be technically adept enough to not lose their keys. We have lots of good ideas of how to make it easy for user and still be secure, but it's always going to be a tradeoff of ease-of-use versus security.
@_date: 2014-11-28 07:03:49
I actually think Coinbase's and Blockchain's solutions are complimentary. Some users want to keep their own keys and would never trust a company like Coinbase. Some users are not savy enough to do it themselves and would trust Coinbase to secure it better than they could and for the convenience. Some users would have both a Coinbase and a Blockchain wallet.
I don't agree that centralized is not compatible with Bitcoin. Bitcoin gives you the ability to control your own funds, but you still need services built on top of it to help make things easier. People like to compare Bitcoin with the internet. The internet made information decentralized. Everyone can connect to each other and share information. This lets you control your own information and host your own blog on your own webservers. That gives you full control. Why doesn't everyone do that? Because it's not easy to set up a webserver yourself. So that's why people use centralized services like blogger, wordpress, medium, etc. Those centralized services can change your words, remove your posts without warning, or even lose all your past posts. But people still use them because it's convenient. Of course money is different than information, but the idea is the same. Centralized services like Twitter, Facebook, Blogger ARE compatible with decentralized information. And centralized services like Coinbase, BitStamp, BitPay, Xapo ARE compatible with decentralized money.
@_date: 2014-11-28 00:06:48
Yes, you can. You need to provide your identity if you are buying or selling. And there are also certain situation where we will ask you for your identity. This is just because we need to follow the US laws. But if you really care that much about privacy, an online wallet is not the best solution. This is because the provider will be able to see all the coins you've received and where you've sent coins.

It's a bit complicated why we needed to do it this way. The 2nd transaction does return the min dust change back to the user account. And that will stay there, but the user will not be able to spend it. It's too little for us to send that back to the hot wallet as the fees would cost more.

That's a bug also. The feature has existed for a long time. We've added plenty of features since then that let's you request BTC via an address. For example, you can request BTC via a merchant invoice, which does let the sender pay to an address.

The 3rd key (user seed) is only used if the user either forgot his passphrase or wants to send coins outside of Coinbase. So there's no reason for Coinbase to ask the user for their user key.
The downside of the 2of2 solution is that you have to keep moving your coins around before the lock time expires. And there's always a risk in exposing your keys to move coins.

Just like Reddit/Facebook/Twitter/Google are centralized providers of information on a decentralized internet backbone, there's room for companies like Coinbase to provide some sort of centralized service (microtx, merchant processing, tips, etc.) on top of decentralized Bitcoin.

We are asking you to verify your phone number. But that only goes so far. Some people are still able to create a lot of phone numbers.
In the end, the more we ask the user to do, the less useful this becomes to introduce new users. If you ask them to add a bank account, they quickly lose interest and won't give Bitcoin a try. So we want to keep this as simple as possible for new users yet try our best to block people trying to scam us.
So right now, the decision is to ask for unique phone numbers. And if we find some schools still abusing this, we just have to shut that school down. There's no other way to weed out the bad folks without hurting the good ones. If you can think of something better, let me know.

Sorry about that. This is Charlie Lee from Coinbase.
I have spent the past few weeks fixing this problem. And I have solved 
99% of the cases when this happens. I do realize that it's unacceptable to have this fail at any time. So I will keep fixing until we get to 0 delayed payments.
FYI, according to our internal stats, we had 6 cases (in the past 24 hours) where transactions where delayed being created. I will try my best to get that down to 0. 
@_date: 2014-08-22 08:26:51
The cause for most of these stuck transactions is because we used to update a user's balance whenever they received a transaction, even before that transaction is confirmed. But if the user tries to spend that balance, we will only used confirmed transactions, where confirmed means 6 confirmations. So if you recently deposited coins or if someone sent you coins, and you turn around and try to send all your coins out of your Coinbase account, this would lead to your send being stuck for ~1 hour. We also had cases where people were being sent satoshi spam and that cause them to not be able to send out their full balance because the satoshi spam would never confirm. This is a horrible user experience and it was just badly designed from the start. The fix seems simple: just don't increase the user balance until the incoming transaction is confirmed. This is actually what I did, but it turns out that it was not an easy fix as our balance calculation code is very complicated and a lot of our code relied on the fact that unconfirmed transactions are represented in the user's balance.

Gravatar bug. The URL for Gravatar images is just an MD5 hash of user's email.

I have actually suggested this to Jackson Palmer and he seemed intrigued by the idea. We'll see if he agrees. Litecoin and Dogecoin merged mined would be beneficial to both coins.

There are a few issues we are trying to solve. We don't let you send unconfirmed transactions. So if you just received some coins, they may be unconfirmed, but we add it to your balance. If you try to send those out, the transaction will get delayed until your coins are confirmed. We are working on making it such that unconfirmed coins are not counted towards your balance. This is a bit trickier than you'd expect.
The other problem with this, is that if you create 2 transactions in a row, sometimes then 2nd relies on change from the first one, which is unconfirmed. So your 2nd transaction might be delayed. There are ways to fix this that we are working on.
There's also a few other smaller bugs that are causing send problems. I personally will spend the next weeks fixing these problems.

Here’s some more info:
The individual Multisig Vault is a 2-of-3 Hierarchical Deterministic Multisig (HDM) wallet. It’s built with 3 seeds:
* **Coinbase seed**: Coinbase holds this key
* **Shared seed**: Coinbase and user both hold an encrypted copy of this key. Only user has the passphrase to decrypt it
* **User seed**: User holds this key
When user tries to withdraw from the vault, the user is asked for their passphrase. The shared seed is decrypted client-side and is used to derive the key to sign the transaction on the client-side. Coinbase then signs the transaction using its key, derived from the Coinbase seed, on the server-side. With 2 signatures, the transaction is ready to be broadcasted on the Bitcoin network.
Using multisig technology, we have designed in quite a few safety nets to make it harder for users to make a mistake and lose access to their funds. Here are some scenarios:
* **You forget your vault passphrase**: You can use your User seed with Coinbase to recover your bitcoin.
* **You lose your backup keys**: You can use your vault passphrase to sweep funds to a new multisig vault with new keys.
* **Someone stole your backup keys**: Since the Shared seed is encrypted with BIP38, it will take a long time for someone to break the encryption using brute force. You can safely move funds out of that account before the encryption is broken.
* **You need immediate access to your funds and cannot wait for the 48 hour vault withdrawal delay**: You can use the multisig recovery tool to withdraw the coins using your backup keys, and this withdrawal will be immediate.
* **Coinbase website is down**: You still have access to your funds using the multisig recovery tool.
Unfortunately, if you lose your backup keys *AND* forget your vault passphrase, you will lose access to the account and Coinbase would not be able to help you recover the funds.
Lastly, one great use case for the Multisig Vault is for users that only use Coinbase to buy bitcoin and immediately transfer their coins out of their Coinbase wallet. These users can now buy coins straight to their Multisig Vault, so they will have full control of their coins at all times.
EDIT: Here's the multisig recovery tool ( and the source code (

The reason why it's not a vote is because it's not binding. Miners have a veto to block a feature via BIP9 by never signaling that they are ready. If that's the case and the majority of economic nodes want to use SegWit, then we will propose another way to get SegWit into Litecoin.
Of course I would rather we all work together for the best for Litecoin. But the checks and balances that exists within Bitcoin/Litecoin gives users the ability to overrule miners if needed. Most people are not aware of this and think that miners are in control.
I will elaborate on this if we come to that. But for now, I am working hard to convince the pools and miners to work with us and support SegWit.
@_date: 2014-07-11 06:04:54
That's true, but the design is such that we will restore from cold storage when the hot wallet is low. So we should very unlikely be caught in a situation where the hot wallet is empty. We also prioritize small txns over large txns. So a withdrawal of &gt;100 btc could be delayed, but a payment to a merchant should never be delayed. We believe this to be a good tradeoff.

Ok, I was not specific. ACH may be settled the next day, but it takes 4 days (and sometimes more!) for a bank to figure out that (oops!) there was insufficient funds in the bank account. And when that happens, they would just pull the money back. So in order to not take the loss when user overdraws their bank account, we (Coinbase) have to wait 4 business days for every user before we can give out the bitcoin.

Hey Patrick, I have already gotten your answer to this question in person, but I figure I should ask this publicly also.
The Bitcoin Foundation has previously been very hostile towards Litecoin and other altcoins. They believed that the goals of "development, safety, and promotion" only applied to Bitcoin and basically tried to pretend that Litecoin and other altcoins do not exist, should be ignored, and are detrimental to Bitcoin.
With you as the new Executive Director of the Bitcoin Foundation, would this stance change? I and many others believe that we are in this crypto revolution together. And it is in the best interest of the Bitcoin Foundation to help with the development, safety, and promotion of all crypto-currencies. Do you agree?

Sure, but what if SegWit opens up a situation where a specific SegWit transaction can cause them to generate an invalid block. Losing 1 LTC block costs them $100. Losing 1 BTC block costs them $12,500. Sometimes you don't run into these edge cases until you are running in live production. And malicious actors would not attack you unless there's something to be gained.

It's not marketing that makes the Coinbase tip button great. It's the ease of use. Most people already have a Coinbase account, so one click tipping is a lot easier to do. If I had to go to my Bitcoin wallet to send you 10 cents, I would not bother.
I see that you have changed your tip buttons to coin widget. My bet is that you will see less tipping. Don't believe me? Put both buttons on your pages and see which one gets used more.

Arguing if it's a vote or a signal is not that useful. In the end, it is what it is. Miners think it's a vote and are voting against it currently. Perception is reality and I understand that.
I'm trying to change this perception and tell people that they actually have the power and not the miners. Don't just accept SegWit as dead just because the miners voted no.
Changing PoW is the ultimate stick that users can use to keep miners in line. But in this case, we have a few other options. This all assumes that the vast majority of users want SegWit. One option is to do a hardfork SegWit. This of course has a lot of risks. But because SegWit is a softfork, there's another option to force this softfork even if we don't get miner consensus. I will go into details later on if we need to go there.

Mining nodes are economic nodes also. But they don't get full control. I don't agree that they have elevated power. It's just that mining solves the Byzantine General's problem, so their "votes" can be accurately counted whereas user votes cannot be. Miners also are responsible for extending the blockchain and they get paid to do that.
Normally miners cannot block a new transaction type. But in the case of SegWit, because we are deploying it as a softfork, we need to make sure that miners restrict themselves from mining transactions that steal from the anyone-can-spend SegWit transactions. If SegWit is activated, miners don't have to upgrade their node to the latest code that understands SegWit. They just can't mine a SegWit-stealing transaction in a block because it will be orphaned.
But if users of Litecoin want to use SegWit, miners should not be able to stop that, right? There are various ways to resolve this conflict. Like you said as an example, if the elected official doesn't listen to its constituents, something will change. And it's not necessarily replacing the official, but it's definitely not going to be the people accepting it.

Your tool is not well known. The first time I saw it was a few days ago when you performed another double spend and bragged about it.


I must have missed that class.


I agree that opt-in RBF will have no impact on double spends. It just creates a horrible UX for wallets. Full RBF on the other hand will destroy 0-conf altogether. Even with 5% of miners implementing full RBF, absolutely no one can accept 0-conf at all without going out of business. That **will** kill Bitcoin's ability to be used as payment in stores. LN can solve this but it's not here today.


If we didn't optimize for better UX over losses, doublespending using fee differential will not be possible against us. It takes sophistication for thieves to find holes in a merchant's (or merchant processor's) double spend protection. Just as it takes sophistication for merchants to figure out how to protect themselves from double spends. Of course, if once the hole is found and the attack tool is published, it no longer takes sophistication.
@_date: 2016-01-13 02:55:49
It is good enough. Otherwise we wouldn't be offering it. And others will have to compete with the same feature. Competition works to make things better for users. And if it's not good enough, Coinbase will lose a bundle and either stop offering it or go out of business. This is a decision only Coinbase can make for ourselves.
And claiming that if we are upset about it means we shouldn't support it is dumb. Walmart doesn't have arm guards guarding their store exits checking user purchases. Why? Because it's a bad UX, shoplifting deterance is good enough, and most people won't shoplift. But if someone does, Walmart has a right to be upset about it and prosecute.
The problem is that core devs are far removed from real world use case of Bitcoin. They shouldn't be making these decisions that harm Bitcoin use cases today.
@_date: 2016-01-28 21:03:46
The Shift Card does a lot for bitcoin as a store of value. It does very little for bitcoin as a payment method. But it's one step in this chicken and egg problem. Because you need people to have bitcoin before they can spend bitcoin. So Shift Card lets people easily spend their bitcoin, which gives people more reasons to actually hold bitcoin.

He didn't do that. Makes me question why.
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:49:39
Me too. It just doesn't help when there's a core dev actively undermining our business.
He could easily have sent me an email or opened a hackerone ticket with something like this: "I was testing this against my own merchant account. And I noticed that you are accepting 0-conf payments when the fee is less than 0.00005. In the recent Bitcoin release, we raised the min relay fee to 0.00005. A payment with that low of a fee will not get to all the miners. You may want to adjust your filters to make instant payments safer." That's what one would expect: Bitcoin core devs should work with Bitcoin companies to help Bitcoin adoption.
Instead, he attacks a real merchant to show off to his friends, then publicly boasts about it and show everyone how easy it is to steal from us. He even links to his doublespend tool so any kid can easily steal from us. Very irresponsible for a core dev to act this way. No wonder why people think Peter Todd is being paid to destroy Bitcoin.

For merchants, we have instant exchange, where we immediately sell the bitcoin for fiat (1% fee, first $1M free). When they choose this option, we take on the risk for double spends. If we tell the merchant that payment is complete (even if bitcoin txn has no confirmation), we take on the risk that the bitcoin txn never confirms.
If the merchant does not choose the instant exchange option, then they are getting the bitcoins that the customer sent them. They can decide how many confirmations to wait before they send out their product. If they choose to send out their product without a confirmation, then they will be out of the bitcoins if the txn never confirms.

@_date: 2016-01-11 22:46:41
It's not unsurmountable. It's just that merchants are hard-pressed to put more work to accept Bitcoin. If it's any harder, they would just stop accepting it. So better for us to either accept it as acceptable loss or give some legit users a bad experience than to make it harder for merchants by adding more process.
@_date: 2016-01-12 04:18:13
Its ok to test our system, but responsible disclosure is key. If someone finds a flaw, it is responsible to use our bug bounty program to report it instead of publishing it to the public. Email also works if hackerone is too complicated. Disclosing to the public just makes it easy for others to perform the same attack. So the loss is not just $10. Very irresponsible.

My views for Bitcoin differs slightly from my views for Litecoin. Bitcoin needs to be the most secure and decentralized crypto, so it cannot compromise on block size.

Coinbase was taken off the page due to Brian's tweet. Even after I've explained that Coinbase is not running XT as our main node ( we still got taken off bitcoin.org. So we got taken off **only** because you wrongly thought that we weren't running Bitcoin. And now, you have all these other excuses for not putting us back. If you are going to put all your pull requests out in the open, at least be up front about your bias against Coinbase. Don't play these sly tricks.
As for experimenting with XT, I think it would be irresponsible for us **to not** test out XT. What if a fork happened and we weren't ready? And XT supporters on Coinbase no longer had access to their XT coins. FWIW, we want to make sure we serve our customers. So we may have to support both Core and XT coins when that happens no matter which side we supported.

Of course there are risks, but we have mitigated them and deemed them acceptable for a better UX. But if someone manages to find a new hole (not that this is one), responsible disclosure is appreciated.
For example, there are risks to accepting ACH bank transfers to buy bitcoin as ACH transfers has a 60 day chargeback window. We are aware of these risks and have mitigated them. But if Peter Todd finds a new way to scam us with a fake ID, a responsible person would be tell us first instead of scamming us and say "if you want the money back, let me know." Instead, he says Coinbase knows that ACH transfers have chargeback risks, it's our fault, and that we shouldn't accept ACH transfers at all.

Our mission at Coinbase is to try to make Bitcoin easy to use for everyone. So we are willing to take these small losses from time to time and not force everyone to wait for a confirmation when their wallet software didn't include a high enough fee. It's true, accepting 0-conf is hard work, but there are ways to mitigate the risks of 0-conf payments. We have to constantly adjust our filters when new bitcoin software is released or when miners change their mempool policies. We do want keep accepting 0-conf payments. Making users wait for a confirmation is a horrible user experience. It's hard enough to convince merchants/users to use Bitcoin for payments even with 0-conf!
Instead of being a PITA, why don't you work with companies to help them accept 0-conf reliable, or as reliably as possible?

Can you always spot a counterfeit bill? No, but you mostly can and it is good enough.
Can you merchants reliable accept visa cards with no risk? No, but identity theft risks are mitigated and good enough.
Can you always trust a 0-conf transaction? No, but you mostly can with caveats and it is good enough.
Not sure why good enough is not acceptable when dealing with money.
@_date: 2016-01-13 01:34:11
Good enough doesn't mean it can't be replaced with something better. But that something better doesn't have to be perfect either. The point is there's no need to cripple something that's good enough just because it's not perfect.
Bills are not perfect because they can be counterfeited. Does that mean, we should remove all security features on the bill and make it trivial to counterfeit? That will teach people to never trust bills!
Credit cards are not perfect because there's fraud. Does that mean we should stop all anti-fraud measures and force the user to eat the cost of all fraud? That will teach people to not use such a broken payment method!
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:32:35
That bar is high enough as is. And It's practically impossible if there's no place for a healthy debate.
To take Litecoin as an example, a thread solely about Litecoin has no place here. **But** a thread about some feature of Litecoin that one might also want for Bitcoin should be discussed here. Because it is Bitcoin community discussing about Bitcoin. If the majority of the users here want to discuss it, it means that the economic majority wants to discuss it. Simple as that.

Making 0-conf foolproof is impossible, but making it good enough is not. That is until miners start doing full-RBF. My complaint is mainly directed towards you trying to push full-RBF on miners.
Thanks for all of the devs' hard work, but please don't kneecap us in the meantime. :)

Sorry if it is confusing. It should say the COINBASE KEY is the only key that Coinbase stores unencrypted. The SHARED KEY is encrypted by a passphrase that only the user knows.
@_date: 2016-06-03 08:57:08
Contact support. If your order was incorrectly canceled due to a overly sensitive fraud prevention system, support can set things straight and get you your bitcoins at the original price you agreed to.
@_date: 2016-06-03 19:05:27
Shamir's secret sharing is similar to multisig, where you need m of n keys to unlock funds. For Shamir's,  the keys get split into multiple parts and you need m of n part together to reconstruct the key. So the security aspects is similar to bitcoin multisig, but the coins are not stored in p2sh addresses.
If you find somewhere where we claim that we use Bitcoin p2sh multisig to store our cold wallet coins, let me know and I can correct it.
@_date: 2016-06-03 22:09:28
Our servers don't have sufficient private keys to spend the coins. Yes, a website based system is not foolproof. But nothing is really foolproof. It's always a tradeoff between security and convenience. I do believe our multisig solution makes this tradeoff really well.

That's fine. It's dangerous to rely on security by obscurity.


That's silly. Then the server (Coinbase) will have access to your passphrase


I don't understand this. There is already a key (Coinbase key) that is not shared with the end user.
@_date: 2016-06-03 15:05:56
The fraud algorithm is independent of price movement. It's bad business to steal from your customers. An honest business makes more money in the long term. It is safe to assume that people who benefited from a canceled order after a price drop is less likely to post on Reddit than those that felt cheated.
@_date: 2016-06-05 03:41:14
We don't publicize our roadmap. But I'm personally a big fan of SegWit and want Coinbase to support it as soon as possible.
@_date: 2016-06-03 22:38:22
That's correct. You have to trust Coinbase each time you spend. That's something we cannot workaround due to Coinbase being a webapp. 
But we do provide an open source withdrawal tool that you can use to spend coins without Coinbase's help. You can even use it if coinbase.com is down. So if you want to be extra careful, download that tool, check the source, and always use that tool to withdraw. And you will be safe assuming Coinbase or your computer was not compromised at the time you created the vault.
@_date: 2016-06-03 22:16:28
How is it "no master password" when your 24 word seed is just that?
@_date: 2016-06-03 22:29:49
The shared key is encrypted on the browser side by user's passphrase that Coinbase does not have. So the encrypted shared key cannot be used by Coinbase to sign transaction without the user first decrypting it.
When the user wants to send funds, Coinbase sends this key to the user's browser and they enter this passphrase to decrypt the key to sign the transaction. Then Coinbase signs it using the Coinbase key.
Hope this clears up the confusion.
@_date: 2016-06-03 19:08:43
They could. So our team has to do a good job in trying to figure it out. There are still mistakes. We sometimes let scammer through and end up losing coins AND we sometime just couldn't tell the difference between an honest user and a scammer and we couldn't fulfill his buy order.

It's hard to tell a scammer from an honest buyer. If we call up a scammer and ask him, he's going to pretend to be honest. Nothing gained there. So we have to rely on our fraud algorithms to try its best to separate the two. And it makes mistakes, but in most cases if you write into support, we can manually look into it and determine that it's not fraudulent and give your bitcoins to you at the originally agreed to price.

I have a confirmation code that proves that my passphrase unlocks an encrypted private key that maps to the bitcoin address on the coin. If I ever sell these coins, I will give the passphrase and confirmation code to the buyer. So the only trust is that Mike Caldwell didn't screw up and not put the correct encrypted private key under the hologram. So far, Mike's work has been top notch. But of course, would you trust it with $1M if you have that kind of money? That is for you to decide. Do note that I have not funded these with any BTC. :P

Wow, you are clueless. By segregating the witness, we get all these benefits. The the reason why devs thought of SegWit was initially to fix txn malleability. The scaling benefit was a side effect that was a pleasant surprise. Because by moving the witness data out, there's extra space in the same 1mb blocksize for more transactions. The devs didn't approach this to try to solve scaling as a softfork. There are much simpler ways to solve scaling as a soft fork like extension blocks. There's absolutely no need to add so much complexity to segregating the witness if all we cared about was the hack in a blocksize increase.

Never funded. It's supposed to be funded after purchase. And with BIP38 keys, even Mike Caldwell can't steal the coins. There's cryptographic proof that the address is indeed encrypted with the passphrase. So you just have to trust that Mike did put the corresponding private key under the hologram.

Sorry for the confusion. Rosie's post was addressing a question about our reporting tool (I believe) and she wasn't talking about reporting to IRS. We are currently not doing that. I know the IRS news is on everyone's mind and people just jumped to that conclusion.
Dave tried to address it by saying that it's a report for personal use and thought that it was clear that we were not sending that report to the IRS and that the user can decide how to use that report as they see fit.
Once it was clear that there was still confusion, I jumped in and tried my best to clear things up.
It's probably a bad design decision to label the transaction in the reporting tool as a sale. TBH, I have not used that tool myself and don't know for sure what we are doing. It's just tool to help out our users. And I assume we show you the market price of BTC at the time of the transfer to help you do taxes in case that info helps. We probably went a bit overboard to give you more info than most people need. But please understand that we aren't intentionally trying to mislead users. We wouldn't do that. We have your best interest in mind. It does nothing to protect ourselves by showing your transactions as sales in a personal reporting tool.

If you just go by reddit, you'd think Coinbase is scamming all their users. As a business, Coinbase aims for a win/win relationship with users. Anything else is shortsighted and pretty dumb. Sure, we make mistakes sometimes, but we try our best to fix it if we can.

By forking the codebase, I meant a contentious hardfork of the consensus protocol, the users, and the miners. (Not enough characters in a Twitter message!)
Some people have mentioned that it's ironic for me to say this because I forked Bitcoin to create Litecoin. That fork is drastically different than what BitcoinXT is doing. Litecoin uses a different proof of work, so that it's not competing with Bitcoin for miners. And by creating a new genesis block, it did not fork Bitcoin's userbase. Users and miners can choose to (or not) support Litecoin and it would have no effect on Bitcoin whatsoever.
People have also said that forking the code is just a push of a button and that people do it all the time with open-source software projects. So forking should be encouraged instead of discouraged. I agree with this, but Bitcoin is different in that there is one thing that you need to be careful with. And that is the consensus protocol. Bitcoin only works if everyone (well, the vast majority of the people) are on the same protocol. Any small change to the protocol will leave users on a different fork and not able to reach consensus with the rest of the network. And that's fine in most cases. Users/miners, finding that they are left behind (shorter chain length), can quickly fix their code to be back in consensus.
The reason why BitcoinXT is dangerous and irresponsible is because it could potentially destroy Bitcoin and split the userbase into 2 separate Bitcoin networks. There are very good reasons why most of the core developers and Bitcoin experts are super cautious with increasing the block size too quickly. But these reasons are hard to explain to regular users of Bitcoin. Yet, it is quite easy for Mike &amp; Gavin to convince people that supporting BitcoinXT means supporting block size increase, which makes Bitcoin scale for worldwide use, and it's what Satoshi intended. BitcoinXT is set to trigger with 75% miner support. This means it can trigger with only 50% miner support + a lucky streak. Or if there are malicious people running NoXT, they can cause the trigger to go off without majority support. When that happens, there's no guarantee that the losing side will all switch to running BitcoinXT. Now you've got a split user base and miner base. Some wallets will support BTC, some will support BTCXT, and some may support both. Same for exchanges and payment processors. It's going to be total chaos. Miners will switch back and forth between mining BTC and BTCXT. Users will send transactions on one network and not know why the recipient didn't get it. The price for both coins will tank. If you thought Litecoin and altcoins dilute the value of Bitcoin, wait til you see what BTCXT does to the price! Actually, the market is already giving us a hint as to why BitcoinXT is such a bad idea.
A more responsible option would have been to set the trigger threshold at a real super majority of 90% miner vote. If it was set at 90%, the chance of a bad fork would be far less likely. But Mike &amp; Gavin knows that there's no way they can get 90% support, so they would rather risk hurting Bitcoin in order to get their way. Mike has even mention using checkpoints to force the issue if XT doesn't get the hashrate majority ( That is scary.
There's a better option. Really try to reach consensus. Unlike what you have been told, the devs actually support increasing the block size. They just couldn't come to a consensus on how much and when. And we still have plenty of time to get to a consensus. Next month, most of the devs and bitcoin experts are gathering in Montreal to discuss this topic to get everyone on the same page. Check out 
I urge people to come to that workshop and contribute. I don't see why we cannot come to a consensus on this topic.

Who actually defined their job? you? satoshi?
The definition of their job is defined by the contract that they get paid the block rewards for mining bitcoin blocks. And they get a bonus for adding transactions to their blocks. So in fact, they are doing their job. They are doing SPV mining because the bonus they get for including transactions is not enough to make up for the lost money for not doing their main job efficiently. Their main job IS mining blocks.
@_date: 2015-07-14 16:11:21
Sad to see all this negativity and downvotes.
FWIW, I think this is a great idea and will consider doing this in Litecoin. We need to think through it thoroughly to see if this opens up any new attack vector.
Other than that, I think the idea is very sound. Sometimes computer scientists makes thing a lot more complicated than it needs to be. There is no reason why the fees have to exactly equate to how much data a transaction uses. A good proxy for that (like number of outputs) is a great replacement to simplify things.
Thanks for the suggestion!

Pieter, what do you think about using Switch Commitments ([ to mitigate this perfect binding vs perfect hiding dilemma? Basically start with perfect hiding &amp; computational binding right now and then if/when quantum computing becomes a reality, switch to perfect binding &amp; computational hiding. Transactions before the switch will not have their amounts revealed and QC cannot inflate the total supply after the switch.
This is what Grin currently has implemented. I think it gives us a good escape hatch and time to come up with a CT commitment scheme that is quantum resistant/proof.

For small transactions, it makes more sense to use altcoins, sidechains, payment channels, lightning network, or offblockchain txns.

I've in favor of it, but someone will be upset to know that the devs can destroy the satoshi that is rightfully theirs. :)
So yeah, a toss up whether it's wise to open this pandora box (dev can make someone's coin unspendable) for the gain of removing 12 million UTXO, which might be a small number in the grand scheme of things if/when Litecoin becomes really popular.

Coinbase is on the right chain because we are running the latest version. Interestingly during the fork, I got notified that our blockchain may not be in sync because we were behind blockchain.info by 3 blocks. Turns out the reason why we thought we were behind is because the v2 chain (what blockchain.info had) was 3 blocks longer than the main v3 chain that we were on.

I disagree. This is the same kind of reasoning that proponents of RBF is using. Just because you can't be perfect, doesn't mean you need to destroy the whole thing to prove a point.
If you do sane but crappy defaults, miners will stick with those crappy defaults, because they have no incentives to change them. All they care about is to make money. And the blockrewards pay them enough to not care about much else.

Litecoin's UTXO set bloat happened mostly in 2011 and early 2012. After the fix, it become too costly to attack Litecoin this way.
I agree that the dust limit, if it works, does a good job at preventing uneconimical outputs.

We as in everyone. Since the outputs are sent to simple brain wallets, anyone can spend them. But the output is so tiny, it would cost more in fees to redeem them. It only made sense for a pool to do it because they can mine it without charging fees on that transaction.

Litecoin is an alternative decentralized network to Bitcoin. Sidechains are either tied to the security of bitcoin or they need to be semi-centralized. The only way to get a secured decentralized network, is the brilliant way done by Bitcoin and invented by Satoshi.

Only tiny economically unfeasible to redeem outputs would be taxed. If your application is creating these spammy transactions, then yes you should be taxed for each of them. That is why people generally agree that satoshi dice transactions are spammy and add a lot of strain to nodes for very little cost to those sites.

ASAP means as soon as possible. It doesn't mean it has to be rushed. I don't think it is a contradiction.
It's only controversial because Core is stubborn. From what I can tell, most people are ok with a 2mb hard fork. We just need to do it well planned out.
@_date: 2015-07-08 03:21:22
Nope. It's just a network relay rule. Transactions not paying enough fees will not be relayed. It will just work if nodes upgrade to this code.

@_date: 2015-07-08 06:21:23
It should have no bad collateral effect.
That said, if you rely on 0 confirmation, there is an edge case. Your patched node will disregard these spam transactions. So if someone pays you with one of these spam transactions or pays using coins from unconfirmed spam transactions, you will not see that payment until it's confirmed.
@_date: 2017-04-18 23:17:30

Each of these transactions is sending 0.00001 BTC ($0.0026) to 34 different outputs. And it only cost this guy $0.08 in fees to send this transaction. So the attacker is able to create a lot of dust spam for a small amount of money.
UTXO stands for unspent transaction outputs. All nodes will have to keep track of them because at any point, a transaction can spend them. Think of them as a box with some amount of money in it. If there are millions of these boxes that have a tiny amount of money in them, it makes it a lot harder for nodes to manage them. 
@_date: 2019-12-05 09:18:56
There's no way to detect this, and that's the worry. The only way to know is if people start to pegout their coins back to the main chain and find out that some coins can no longer be pegged out because there's not enough coins locked up. In a practical sense, this is no different than exchanges possibly running a fractional reserve. You don't know for sure that they have the coins to back up the balances until everyone tries to withdraw.
Most people think QC breakthroughs will happen slowly, so it likely won't all of a sudden be too late. But for sure this is something we will need to keep a close eye on and need to play it safe

It's really the best way for the economy to show what is best for Bitcoin and Litecoin. Hopefully,  the miners will see that and actually act selfishly, like they are supposed to, and break away from cartel-like behaviors. The fact that SegWit has not activated on Litecoin/Bitcoin just proves how centralized mining is.
@_date: 2017-04-05 05:13:31
Litecoin block cycle it 1/4 of Bitcoin, so 3.5 days. But for SegWit, it actually needs 4 block cycles, which matches Bitcoin's 1 block cycle, so 2 weeks.
@_date: 2017-04-05 19:45:57
I don't understand your accusation. F2pool has 30+% of the hashrate. We live in a world where mining is currently centralized. So we have to have f2pool's support to activate SegWit via mining today.
@_date: 2015-07-08 17:52:22
Because we have the private keys to these outputs. A pool can spend them and reduce the UTXO bloat. See the reddit thread about the ~1mb sized transaction that was created by a pool.

Agreed that hard forks is hard for a reason. But if core is on board for a 2mb hardfork, I believe it won't be very contentious.
Yes, Coinbase has run into problems with confirmation times and fees. Like other wallets, we don't have very good dynamic fee calculation in place. So we've had times when transactions are stuck for a long time. Users get upset when that happens.

You know most miners/pools go with the default code. So having sane default code helps a lot. Plus if full nodes run with this code, these spammy transactions won't even be relayed to miners.

Litecoin segwit signaling got to 60%+ not because of centralized mining. Centralized mining just made it so that it jumped up drastically.
@_date: 2016-02-11 19:25:55
First of all, let me clarify. I'm Director of Engineering at Coinbase. My views about how best for Bitcoin to scale differs from Brian. And that's ok and encouraged because scaling Bitcoin, though very important, is tangential to Coinbase's mission, which is to make Bitcoin easy to use.
My view is that I agree with Core that we need to be more conservative with the block size increase. But I don't agree that SegWit should come before a hardfork. I think we should do a 2mb hard fork ASAP and add SegWit, IBLT, and other improvements afterwards. Yet, I think having everyone switching over to Classic today is not a good solution either. I respect Gavin and Garzik a lot, but we shouldn't alienate the Core devs. So I'm hoping the threat of Classic and this letter will convince the Core devs to compromise and work together to come up with a scaling plan that most people will be on board with. If this last ditch attempt doesn't work, then our only option is the nuclear option of overthrowing Core with Classic.
@_date: 2016-02-11 23:12:28
Maybe you should read what I wrote. I didn't threaten to do anything.
@_date: 2015-07-08 05:05:08
Yup, and if they need to create a ton of dust spam to represent colored objects, then they are just leeching off the network and aren't willing to pay for it.
@_date: 2016-02-12 20:13:00
I did not hard fork Litecoin because of something that is contentious. Some people wanted to switch the mining algorithm to keep ASICs out of Litecoin, but most didn't. So that hard fork is dangerous.
Today's Bitcoin hardfork is not going to be that dangerous. If contentious (i.e. what Classic is doing), then there's some danger. But if Core is on board and gave a timeline of X months down the road, it won't be that dangerous. This is because **everyone** in the ecosystem is paying attention right now and will switch to the new fork very quickly.
The block size limit today is causing problems with Bitcoin transactions confirming very slowly. This is causing confusion for users and making adoption hard. That is why the big Bitcoin companies are all pushing for a block size increase. This may be just kicking the can down the road, but that's ok.
@_date: 2016-09-23 20:31:13
Insurance costs money. Someone would need to pay for it. Coinbase charges nothing for storing your coins. We also don't loan out your bitcoins and run a fractional reserve. Keeping those coins secure is costly enough. We would quickly go out of business if we are paying to insure all the coins. Of course, we could pass that cost to the customer if they want an insured cold storage, but that's not a product we are offering today.
@_date: 2016-09-24 07:14:15
My point is that the insurance company will investigate before they will pay up. They won't just pay up when a company claims they got hacked. Of course, a company can fake a hack. But it's not different than a jewelry store having insurance and then get a bunch of thugs to rob itself and try to claim insurance. That's insurance fraud and one would be in a lot of trouble if they got caught doing that.
So to answer your original question:


A few insurance companies would and Coinbase has an insurer that is insuring coverage that surpasses the amount of money we hold in our hot wallet.
@_date: 2016-09-24 04:25:56
They will only insure you if your process is made clear to them. And they figure out the risk and calculate what the insurance premium is. If you don't follow that process, then all bets are off and they won't need to pay up.
So if you claim that your cold storage keys are offline but it turns out that they were online and you get hacked and lost all those coins, the insurance will definitely not pay up.

For certain things, like private key storage, it makes sense to not trust a third party. I don't think it makes sense to write our own email service (at least not the highest priority) given the damage can be pretty well contained.

@_date: 2015-04-02 23:02:32
Are you using the exchange or just regular coinbase buy/sell?
Exchanges have both a bid and ask price. It's definitely confusing for new users. As it's hard to calculate how much your bitcoins are worth.
It's best to just specify how many bitcoin you want to buy and then decide whether or not that's a good price.
@_date: 2015-04-09 18:40:45
Bitcoin users are prime targets for scams because of immediate and irreversibility of bitcoin transactions. So I won't be surprised that one can purchase on the black market these bitcoin emails lists from various hacks.
I am glad to see that not one person has claimed that their Coinbase only email address was targeted.
@_date: 2015-04-07 04:33:45
Ok, I will explain how the fraud works.
1) Bad guy buys/steals identity info from a real person. This includes their bank accounts
2) He opens a coinbase account with the stolen identity
3) He buys bitcoins using the stolen bank account
4) After 4 days, he gets the bitcoins and transfers them off site
5) Weeks/months later, the real owner of the bank account notices an unauthorized ACH debit from Coinbase
6) He tells his bank to reverse the ACH
7) Coinbase is out both the $ and the bitcoins
8) Repeat at step 1
Stolen identity and bank accounts cost a lot less than the Coinbase buy limits. So the attacker can keep doing this until either Coinbase goes out of business or Coinbase only let's users buy $10 worth of bitcoins a day. 
Now do you see why companies like Coinbase need more intrusive fraud detection software than banks?

We never used SendGrid to send out any emails as SendGrid was just a backup mail provider. So the hacker did not get any Coinbase customer emails from the SendGrid hack. Apparently, they bought some Bitcoin related email lists from various other leaks and sent them the phishing email pretending to be from Coinbase. Not surprisingly, those leaked email lists contained users that used the same email address at Coinbase. But most of the people getting the phishing email didn't have an account at Coinbase.

He's correct. Our unused sendgrid account got hacked. And the phisher was able to send email as us with all the right signatures. We should not have kept this backup account active when not in use. And we are doing everything we can to make sure this doesn't happen again in the future.

We will look into it, but these attacks work against the lowest denominators. People who will check PGP sigs won't fall for them anyways. And people who do fall for these scams wouldn't have checked PGP sigs anyways. So I don't think it would help that much.

Mark, you promised me 2 weeks. I'm still waiting... ��
@_date: 2015-03-29 17:43:34
You are right. The math does not work out that way. If RBF is implemented by 1/3 of the miners, then a malicious actor has 1/3 chance of double spending. They would constantly attack the merchants that are selling cash equivalent things like giftcards. That's a very profitable attack and would destroy the merchant processing business.
Wait ten minutes is not worse than the reversibility of credit cards. But even today, we have a hard time convincing merchants to accept bitcoin even with the promise of instant transaction with zero charge backs.
Also remember that with credit cards, they are able to keep fraud at a low rate because the spender's identity is known. If they defraud, it gets harder for them to get a credit card. So instant transaction is used in a lot of cases and the fraud is acceptable. The same thing cannot be said about Bitcoin if RBF is adopted. Any anonymous user can double spend without punishment. Nothing can be done to control the fraud rate. So 0-conf transactions can never be accepted. This makes it worse than credit cards.

I have not talked to Brian specifically about his tweet, so I'm not exactly sure what he's saying. I don't think he was implicitly supporting XT because he was asking people to code up the various proposals. XT's BIP101 is already coded up. There are various other BIPs out there. I think he is just suggesting that we should code them up and start testing them out.
I do not agree with Brian that any of the current solutions are low enough risk. I will be attending the Scaling Bitcoin workshop in HK in December. I think we should be able to reach consensus on a good compromise soon after that.

A pure exchange can be more strict with security than Coinbase can be. Because you would use a BTC-e account as a daily use wallet. But you would with Coinbase. So if Coinbase implemented a 2 day delay on send after a password reset, it would inconvenience a ton of legit users that forgot their password and want to spend some coins.
Coinbase users should use the vault (or multisig vault) to store large amount of BTC. Vaults have the 2 day delay that would have prevented this.
Since Coinbase has so many products and is used by people in different ways, there's no one-size-fits-all security solution that works for everyone. Security and convenience is always a tradeoff.
disclaimer: I work at Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-10-16 20:58:47
Bitcoin's reward schedule is designed such that overtime blockrewards go to 0 and transaction fees will be the only thing left to pay for the security provided by miners. Blocksize currently acts as a supply constraint. And with a supply constraint, people who want to use the blockchain natively will have to pay the high fees to support the miners providing the security. Without a supply constraint, there is no fee pressure. Sure, some miners can refuse to mine low fee transactions. But if it gets mined by someone, everyone will have to pay the cost to validate, propagate, and store those transactions. Being decentralized, everyone has to bear the incremental cost of each additional transaction. And the transaction amount is unrelated to how much it costs the network.
I think the incentives will be messed up in this scenario. Potentially large miners will mine large blocks to squeeze out smaller miners. Smaller miners will stop mining because it becomes unprofitable to mine. Bitcoin will become less decentralized and less secure. We've never had a system like Bitcoin that works so well. It's simple and all the incentives are correct for Bitcoin to self-heal and be anti-fragile. I'm afraid increasing the blocksize may throw a wrench into this delicate system.
@_date: 2015-10-17 04:49:28
I've taken a back set with Litecoin development, but I am still active with the project. Litecoin is in no hurry to implement a block size solution as it can handle effectively 4 times as many txns as Bitcoin, and we are no where near that capacity. 
@_date: 2015-10-16 20:22:08
I agree. I think he's worried that the block size will not be increased and bad things will start to happen when we hit the limit.
@_date: 2015-10-16 20:39:44
I can tell you that I don't like XT: 
I much rather prefer Core+BIP101 over XT, but even then I think BIP101 is too aggressive. BIP101 can potentially kill Bitcoin as we know it. BIP100 is a bit better. I have high hopes that Lightening networks can be the silver bullet that let's us have the cake and eat it too. So I would opt for a conservative small increase in blocksize today and give us enough time to iron out Lightening networks and other solutions that can bring scalability to Bitcoin without reducing decentralization and security.

Sadly we have people that reset their password constantly and need access to their btc right away. We are constantly trying to find the right balance between convenience and security.

Great post! I shared it on twitter:

Surprising to hear this from Peter Todd. Coinbase's whole merchant tools business relies on 0-confirmation working.
If a lot of miners decide to implement RBF today, Coinbase's (and BitPay's) merchant payment processor business will be destroyed. We only make at most 1% from merchant orders. So if there's more than 1% chance that we will lose the whole order from a double spend, then the business will be losing money. The only solutions would be to force consumers to wait ~10 minutes for order confirmation or implement something like green address or payment channels. Any of these solutions will make Bitcoin as a payment network much worse than credit cards. It's already hard enough to convince merchants to adopt Bitcoin. With RBF, it will be much much harder.
When Bitcoin is no longer a useful currency for payments, the price will inevitably drop. No miners will rationally adopt RBF today. After a few more halvings, it may make a little more sense for greedy miners to adopt RBF. But that gives us almost a decade to figure out a payment solution that's both easy to use and works near instantly. There's absolutely no reason to shoot ourselves in the foot today.
**Coinbase fully agrees with Mike Hearn. RBF is irrational and harmful to Bitcoin.**

Signature verification will start becoming significant with large block sizes. IBLT only helps if people play nice. A malicious miner could create a large block with mostly unseen transactions of him sending himself coins. That would force smaller miners to have to validate those transactions after the block is found. If validation takes minutes, that would squeeze out those miners. And if those miners start doing SPV mining, that's no good either.
I think Lightening networks is a good solution. You don't need to use Bitcoin directly. You just need to have the option to use it directly if you so choose and are willing to pay more. LN will be more centralized as you have to go through hubs. Most transactions are fine with that. When I'm buying a Starbucks coffee, I don't care if I'm using LN to pay through the Starbucks hub. But if I'm buying a car with BTC, I want to use the Bitcoin network directly and will pay the higher fees. I think a future like this works well. Not all transactions require the same decentralization and security. The beauty of this is that if you do require it, you can still use the Bitcoin network natively.
I don't know what is really safe as all this is hand-wavy. I feel like the 2-4-8 proposal is relatively safe and gives us enough enough time (4-5 years) to figure out if something like the LN is what we need.
@_date: 2015-02-22 01:42:25

Coins are delivered after 4 business days. Due to the banking holiday on Monday, if you bought coins on Saturday, 4 business days later is next Monday.
The reasons why we delay for 4 business days is due to fraud. ACH debits are never in a "can't be reversed anymore" state. You can reverse it months later. Our internal metrics have found that waiting 4 business days yields the least amount of fraud, so that's why we do that. Sorry, but we are transferring a irreversible currency for a reversible one, so we do everything we can to reduce fraud.
@_date: 2015-02-18 06:29:02
I actually implemented this at Coinbase to make it very easy for merchants to give discounts to users paying in BTC. We launched this about a year ago: 
It's really super easy to do. They just specify a discount and every checkout button they create will automatically apply the discount to the USD amount of the item(s). It even shows the discount as a line item so the buyer can clearly see the discount they get for choosing to pay with bitcoin. 
I think the reason why more merchants don't do this is because of lack of competition and lack of user adoption. Right now, users who choose to pay with bitcoin will pay with bitcoin even if there are no discounts. So giving a discount makes no business sense for merchants. And most merchants are adopting Bitcoin for PR reasons more than for real cost savings. As more and more business start to accept bitcoin, it will become more competitive and I think you will start to see more merchants giving discount to payments using bitcoin. Then, and only then, will we see more user adoption. Cause right now, it doesn't make much sense to spend bitcoin since it costs most users ~1% to acquire them.
@_date: 2016-07-11 04:42:27
Again, what price do you expect us to prefill your limit order?
In case you were not aware, for market orders, we let you buy/sell with either BTC or USD, but for limit orders, we don't let you buy/sell with USD. See 
So the website is not doing any calculation when it's prefiling in the numbers. It's just passing in the values to the API. If you wanted the prefill to be smart about it, we still need to guess at what price you want to buy all your USD with. Like I said, for market orders, that's clear, but not so with limit orders.
Maybe you want the highest bid, but I wasn't aware people commonly trade this way. Or if you already had a priced filled in, you want us to do some math to figure out the BTC you want to buy. If that's what you want, we can probably do that. Is that what you want?

@_date: 2016-07-11 05:14:09
Got it. We previously only did math to give you estimated total USD for an order. But we can probably also do some math to prefill orders in for you. Most people don't create one single limit order with their whole balance, so we did not bother doing this. But I guess it's worth doing if people find it useful.
Please confirm if this is what you expect:
If you have $1000 and you already filled in a buy price of $650, clicking on your full USD balance of $1000, will fill in 1.53846153 for the amount. (1000 / 650 = 1.53846153846154)

That is not true. We only cancel orders for high risk of fraud and not high risk of bitcoin price volatility. Orders are canceled automatically by our risk detection algorithm, which doesn't take into consideration whether the price move against the user or not. So half the time, the user end up on the fortunate side of the price movement. And those users will not come to reddit to complain.

Turning up scrypt parameters led to a lot of slowness in the litecoin-qt UI when a block was found. At the time of Tenebrix and Litecoin launch, no one was thinking about ASICs. It was incorrectly assumed that these weaker parameters was good enough to deter GPUs. So it was a tradeoff.
Also, the point of GPU-resistance was mainly so that Litecoin did not have to compete with Bitcoin for the same miners. That has largely been successful as not long after people started GPU-mining Litecoin, Bitcoin became ASIC-mined.

Agreed. 0-fees exchanges also use tricks to pump their volume. They give users reduced withdrawal/deposit fees for high volume. So users have incentives to pump up their own volume and they can do it for free.
Coinbase has a strict policy of not offering fee breaks to any users. Everyone pays 0.25% taker fee starting on March 30th.

Jason, can't agree more. Humans are by default selfish. I think that comes from evolution... survival of the fittest and everything. Very few people are truly selfless. And from what I've seen, you are one of those few people. I'm glad to have met you briefly that one time. I will be sure to look for you to chat more the next chance I get. Keep up the good work!
@_date: 2013-08-15 23:18:50
Yes, you can send to any email address or bitcoin address.
@_date: 2015-02-11 21:41:41
You don't believe me? Which part is funny?
@_date: 2013-10-30 20:59:24
I have 20 times more litecoins.

Thanks. We try our best to push the boundary, and we do get burnt sometimes. But if you don't try different things, you will never get better.
@_date: 2013-10-19 03:29:13
Send me the link and will investigate.

Not yet, we are looking into providing a SMS-only interface to coinbase. So users can send bitcoins to any phone number and the recipient can sign up an account via SMS. Stay tuned. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 20:23:51
Sorry, I'm not on the support team. As you can imagine, our support tickets have spiked recently. Olaf and his team is working hard to try to answer all of them. Please be patient. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-10-23 18:57:52
Thanks for the heads up. This issue has now been fixed.
@_date: 2013-10-11 19:52:51
This is outrageous. Sent you another Litecoin donation. Please help make these people LESS homeless.
@_date: 2013-10-23 18:23:27
We figured out the problem. Should be fixed soon.
EDIT: Ok, we've fixed it. Please try to log in again.
@_date: 2013-10-31 07:48:30
I fixed the problem where transactions are disappearing. Still looking into the problem where transactions are taking a long time to confirm.

Yup, we will look into having local international numbers.

Sorry, we are currently working on fixing this. Should be fixed soon. Please open a support ticket if this is still broken tomorrow. Thanks!

The 0-confirm coins are due to us sending coins from the shared wallet to your wallet before you withdraw the coins to a bitcoin address. So it means there's no risk with those 0-confirm coins. It's not like we will double spend against you. And if your 0-confirm coins does happen to be double spent for some reason, we will of course make things right for you.

There's an optimal block time that balances out speed versus the loss of mining efficiency. Is it 10 mins, 2.5 mins, or 30 seconds? Hard to say as there hasn't been a detailed analysis on this. But I contend that the optimal block time is closer to Litecoin's 2.5 minutes than it is to Bitcoin's 10 minutes. 
Litecoin also uses a proof of work algorithm (scrypt) that scales better (more linearly) with hardware generations than Bitcoin's sha256d. 
Litecoin also has a fee structure that's harsher on dustspam. So things like Satoshi dice are less of a strain on the network. 
These are not revolutionary changes, but a tiny evolution.

It's secured by a phone call and your pin. So the hacker must spoof an SMS to us, intercept our call to you, and know your 6-digit pin number. It's as secure as we can make it given the lack of encryption on SMS messages and phone calls.
It's also opt-in if you feel like the benefits of being able to access your account via sms is not worth the extra security risk.

Thanks. Will do. :)
@_date: 2013-08-16 02:32:56
We require an automated phone call for you to enter your pin to make sure someone is not spoofing the SMS message. Try out the service and I think you will realize the voice call is not that bad.
@_date: 2013-11-14 06:02:50
Send me a PM, and I can help you take a look.
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:53:06
Yes, but unfortunately we can't give away too much about exactly what we do. Scammers are really smart and try their best to trick us into believing that they are legitimate users. So we do whatever we can to try to stop them. And sometimes honest users get mis-labeled by accident. We will keep trying different things to get better at this.

No. Please re-read seven_five's post above. BitStamp is not the market, and neither is MtGox. If anything [BitcoinAverage]( might be closer to the real bitcoin market price than any one exchange.

Sorry, our development environment just uses the $10 price for simplicity. I guess we just never bothered to update it. I will fix the image. EDIT: picture updated
@_date: 2013-11-26 10:04:18
Please don't spread rumors.
"Not all wallet software supports addresses that being with 3. Bitcoin-Qt and Electrum support it, and I've heard that Coinbase also supports it. Any simple EWallet that uses Bitcoin-Qt directly should support it."
By "it", he's saying Coinbase also supports "addresses that [begin] with 3" not that Coinbase supports CoinValidation.
Coinbase has not made a statement on this, but I personally am 100% against it.
@_date: 2013-11-21 05:13:12
Satoshi's brilliance is unquestionable. I am not as smart or as innovative as him (or them) and don't claim to be. Bitcoin is revolutionary. Litecoin is just a tiny evolution of Bitcoin. So, no, it's not in the same ballpark if you are talking about being revolutionary. But that doesn't mean Litecoin can't grow into a popular alternative currency to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-08-16 05:29:14
No, is that something you would want to be able to do also?
@_date: 2013-11-14 08:19:51
Both transactions should have been broadcasted.

When you use BitTip to send a tip, it automatically prefills a reply with the text. You can choose to not post it if you want it to be private.
@_date: 2013-10-18 20:59:28
This is actually written by coinbase. So you should be able to trust that it won't do anything harmful. The source is here:

Try it out for yourself. It doesn't create a Coinbase account for you. You will get a link, and if you open it with your current Coinbase acct. It will deposit the tip into your acct. And all future tips will be sent to that account.
