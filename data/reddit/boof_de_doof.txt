Makes sense, nothing good happened and the price went up.

The SEC will be heavily swayed by your 'paid shill' 'complete dipshit' 'can't abstract what Bitcoin is' and 'troll' arguments. Phew! Good work, guys.

Having worked for vendors filing vending machines:
* Moving money from vending machines is not a job that needs to be done by security staff.
* It certainly doesn't require two staff members.
* We picked up the money when we refilled the machine.

Wow, good thing no one in Bitcoin space would ever do such a [thing]( like monetizing debt. We're all so much better than the greedy people and their filthy fiat!

Want to know why you had no success with Kickstarter? Cause it's a *really* pointless 'app'.


Oh, in that case, let me start throwing some money at you...to what, hire a developer?
