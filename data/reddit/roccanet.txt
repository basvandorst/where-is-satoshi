apple is dead against both NFC and qrcodes because - god forbid - they dont control these technologies and they exist outside their app revenue stream. google seems to half-ass support them. there is no reason both of them shouldnt just allow you to decode a qrcode right from your camera without needing an app

i am continually blown away by anyone using paypal. it is an absolutely rotten company that can freeze your account at will - for whatever reason they make up. rotten. dont use them - ever - for anythng
@_date: 2014-07-08 17:42:07
so can rubles, dollars, yen, goats, petroleum, and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 17:02:42
paypal fucking sucks - and are a bunch of bullies. i will never, ever use them for anything again after the rotten experience i have had with their idiot, accusatory customer service
@_date: 2014-02-06 10:38:40
among other things. they also beat the shit out of html5
@_date: 2014-02-19 17:21:56
this doesnt surprise me at all. owned a business in montreal and dealing with the banks was absolutely dreadful. the canadian banking industry is adverse to change at their own peril
@_date: 2014-02-09 20:56:55
they already make money from the advertising.

ignoring huge financial fraud and stifling inovation - hell of a job SEC
@_date: 2014-02-08 13:30:27
well ok i probably meant digital wallet then. but that would need their own payment system
@_date: 2014-02-08 07:50:03
because they are getting ready to release their own payment system and are cleaning house of competitors. it is utter bullshit
@_date: 2016-01-13 19:52:14
hey nice - you binged it! and completely contradicted yourself two comments up. make sure you know the shot before you open your mouth and insult someone "Are you not paying attention to world events at all? Or do you just hear about something and make your own justification for it?" simpleton

good. the cheaper oil is the better for 99% of the population. 
@_date: 2016-01-13 18:25:42
ha you have no inkling of the economics of oil - nor why the price is down. It has nothing to do with "world events"
@_date: 2016-01-12 12:23:55
ok good point - lets agree to say some are fucked ;-) 
@_date: 2016-01-12 11:14:12
they should get into clean energy as a career change then. the world is changing and dirty energy is no longer profitable.
@_date: 2016-01-12 12:00:56
i disagree - i think its a sign that the world is moving closer to a time of energy surplus and post-modern economy that is no longer driven by oil and gas interests. This financial turmoil is a correction that is reflecting this realization - and to boot its probably better for the world for a lot of the oil based economies to weaken. Having a poorer russia and saudi arabia is a good thing to me
@_date: 2016-01-12 22:33:38
oil is not profitable at 40$ a barrel for quite a few operations - including i believe the saudis and russians. Its that cheap because demand is down and production is up - all the while advances in efficiency for green operations become more and more attractive.
@_date: 2016-06-17 20:33:19
media will anyway. its too easy of a story to write
@_date: 2016-06-21 05:49:24
got an alternative?
@_date: 2016-06-25 21:00:44
they are getting exactly what they voted for - GOP bullshit
@_date: 2016-11-10 01:20:39
much like donald trump - he is full of shit

i wouldnt be patting anybody on the back just yet. i have a feeling the DEA is going to be having a great year next year after who we put in office. im actually afraid that they might go after people that got a state sanctioned prescription. who the fuck knows? 
@_date: 2016-02-10 08:24:02
paypal blows
@_date: 2015-09-03 12:46:28
my take is the chickens are coming to roost for the chinese. i say china takes a justified 20 percent nosedive over the next year.

not a fucking chance. when uncle sam puts you in the crosshairs there is nothing that will save you.
