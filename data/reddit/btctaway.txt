throwaway for OBVIOUS satoshi related "dont want to die for nothing" reasons
...Over 200. i went in for 2k, feeling like my 8k in savings(at the time) was doing nothing for me. 
i went in just below $6/ea, but have spent time doing 3 things:
1) spending bitcoins - i considered hoarding, but realized this was bad for my fellow man in the long run. i wanted reddit "gold" accountants to FEEL the power. i wanted btcbuy and bitcoinstore to WIN. so i spent.
2) GIVING bitcoins - my friends were never going to believe this. i had to make them understand. i knew that once you own btc, you become a btc evangelist(i have conflicted feelings on the ethics of this... i'm super anti-religion anti-cult)... so i had to blow a ton of these to show them "the light." To be honest, the amount of "thank yous" ive received is enough. The respect of 2 major investors for "calling it way ahead of time" is a reward in itself. these guys pay attention to me(where before i was a NOBODY to them) and that's by far my biggest win right now, in terms of "sway"
3) withdrawing my original investment - I withdrew at $27/ea. a person i respect in this field predicted a crash. he was wrong. still, it changed the game for me. suddenly i'm "up" even if the markets goes to $0/ea(which it wont, so... bad move on my part :(  )
should YOU invest?
YES. you will likely not see the returns i have seen because i was LUCKY(like betting red or black on roulette). i didn't have this much science backing me up back then. But you WILL see a return(larger than madoff went to prison for!), and more-to-the-point: you'll contribute to the future currency of the human race, which is pretty sweet and outweighs being rich(being rich is just a bonus)
