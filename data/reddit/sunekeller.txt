What is the main reason that Brazilian people choose to invest in bitcoins? 
I know you got an inflation crisis, so i was thinking if this was something the regular citizen are aware of and understands the concept of? (Money loosing value every sec., and so on)
And is it mainly the middle class investing in bitcoins?

I'm quite new to reddit (As a user) - But I thought that you guys might find it very useful, especially if you are handling bitcoins at your computer.
Protip: Torrent trackers got the premium edition.
Also: I can recommend the WOT (Web of trust) firefox or chrome add-on.. It's kind of a trustpilot with links, and it rates pages on four different parameters: trustworthiness, vendor reliability, privacy, and child safety.. Quite useful to sort out trash sites before you click them. (It will show a green, yellow or red circle after every link, that shows the 'status' of the homepage based on user-reviews.)
I'm not a high-tech guy, so maybe there are better solutions out there for the add-on part - but then please let me know! 
And sorry for my bad English, it's not my native language.

I can only encourage people to donate to EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation). They are fighting for digital rights, and where the group who sued NSA recently. 
 
Quote from wiki:


 EFF has taken action in several ways. It provides funds for legal defense in court, presents amici curiae briefs, defends individuals and new technologies from what it considers baseless or misdirected legal threats, works to expose government malfeasance, provides guidance to the government and courts, organizes political action and mass mailings, supports some new technologies which it believes preserve personal freedoms, maintains a database and web sites of related news and information, monitors and challenges potential legislation that it believes would infringe on personal liberties and fair use, and solicits a list of what it considers patent abuses with intentions to defeat those that it considers without merit.&gt; 
TL;DR - Support EFF, they are the fucking Jedi's of the internet.

I just came up with an idea. Hold a weekly/monthly give away/competition, ~100% user generated and funded with bitcoins. 
Users then will decide who should have the bitcoins, or in what way the money should be handed out. Do they want a competition, or should it be given to some organization, person, or something else?   
I ran into two obvious problems: security and trust.. I think I can except some attacks trying to gain access to the bitcoins, since my name and face are public known, after I’ve been in the television and in the newspapers concerning ACTA – I guess I’m an easy target. 
How do I gain the trust from the users, concerning the skills necessarily to obtain the bitcoins safe in a wallet? Of course I will do anything to prevent them getting stolen. If it happens it would really damages my reputation even though I didn't take them my self – because it’s kind of hard to prove that it wasn't me, as well as who it was. And it's quite easy to prove how much money it contained, deposits and cash outs...
And will users embrace it or not, it's not really working if nobody donates.. I think I will use the first self-funded give-away to find out :)
