Turns out it was fake. Was playing on peoples sympathy.
Swear, this is why I'm hesitant to help anyone out these days.

Wasnt an actual request. Made that one up. But trust me, this man can confuse even the most seasoned tech supporter. Especially when he gets hard headed (usually around the 30 minute mark). Like, his browser has 30+ search bars, his desktop shortcuts are to "antivirus" software i've never heard from before, and he's out more than $4000 via the indian "Microsoft tech support calling about your dell computer". And he trusts every software/scammer blindly, even to the point of defending em. 
The guy cant catch a break, and i feel bad cuz by the time i show up to help, either the damage is already done, or he doesnt like the solution.

Dude, i feel your pain. I frequently help my neighbor. A real bro, but he drives me nuts. Everything is either a usb or a download. 
Him: "Hey deathnote, can you show me how to download movies on a cd?"
Me: "sure, be right over after work."
Ive not got the heart to tell em

Tried that. Dude threw the laptop in a lake cuz he couldnt install windows programs, believing a virus was to blame. Refused to believe me when i informed him that windows programs dont run on linux. 
In hindsight, i prolly shoulda installed wine.

Bitcoin, death by its own hand? Please elaborate

I prefer the portable version of Electrum. I keep all my wallets on an encrypted 8gb usb drive. I download a lot of games via torrent, and at any point my computer can be compromised. When it inevitably happens, my investments remain protected.  
Jaxx is my go-to multi-wallet. But there are security issues when using multi-wallets. For example, an encrypted multi-wallet can be decrypted faster than multiple encrypted wallets. They are also more likely to have more security issues, since multiple wallets merged together is harder to secure than a wallet with a dedicated purpose.

Even reputable normies behind big tech firms don't know anything about tech. When they say their gonna "implement regulations on bitcoin", other normies will panic, but us nerds will wear our shit eating grin.   
Even if bitcoin were stoppable, there no way any of those normies could stop it. And no nerd worth his salt would even attempt to nuke his own investment.  
My proudest moment, was when I taught my dad how to turn on his laptop. Before that, I knew a man who could do anything. He became less of a god, and more a man in the blink of an eye. A man who's hand I am proud to shake.

Was $30,000 in december wasnt it? Back when Jeff Burwick had everyone believing the dollar was gonna collapse in 2018, seemed like everyone was throwing away their dollars for bitcoin. Not gonna lie either, i was on of them
