Just like literally every other service in the world you pay for -- you go find someone with previous work that you are satisfied with, and pay them to complete your task.
I think the FAQ on the site I linked to has a pretty decent explanation of the downsides to spec work.
Edit: The right way to do this would have been to post a thread asking for designers to submit their portfolios for a $200 job and pick one to do the work.

Sorry that I don't constantly post to r/bitcoin, but as one of the active posters in the linked thread, I'm interested what makes you think I'm an idiot for disagreeing with design contests? I don't care if he's a core dev or not, it's very insulting to people who have worked for years to become a decent designer for someone to offer the "opportunity" to get paid for our work. You wouldn't go to deviantArt and commission works from multiple artists, and tell them you'll pay for your favorite, right? Also, aren't core devs now compensated by the foundation?

I'm not saying you can't damage the network with a 51% attack. You can do so in the specific ways I listed. Care to cite any of these articles? I'd definitely be interested in a technical overview of what you claim.
A 51% attack is really just a fork of the blockchain, as you pointed out in your post. By maintaining 51% of the hashing power, you can create transactions on your own blockchain, spend coin from your wallet on the "live" chain, and then broadcast your own longer chain which reverses the first transaction.
In order to change the protocol, all nodes would have to be updated, which you can't do by controlling hashing power. Because when you say "protocol", you really just mean the consensus between the reference implementation and other implementations, which has nothing to do with hashing power.

The algorithms would either have to be selected ahead of time and written into the protocol, in which case it's still feasible to design an ASIC for them, or decided by consensus during each change, which seems like it would introduce a whole slew of other issues. 
Trying to prevent the development of efficient hardware to solve any given computing problem that can be solved on a general purpose CPU seems like a futile effort. CPUs are, by design, "inefficient" for most individual problems because they are optimized for solving a wide variety of problems. That's the whole point of building ASICs.

As a freelance designer and professional developer that makes money in this field, $200 is a perfectly reasonable price for what he wanted. The problem is he wanted everyone to do it for free, and then he would choose someone to pay.
@_date: 2014-12-24 18:08:35
As a computer engineer, I have a very hard time believing such a thing is possible. Anything a general purpose CPU can do, an ASIC can be designed to do comparably or better. You also generally get some power and heat savings since there are much fewer transistors involved.
Edit: I should say, much fewer unused/wasted transistors, so much more of the power input goes to computing hashes.

Do you realize you are more of a condescending ass than I am? You lecture me about being disrespectful to Jeff and then you dish it right back out. Your entire comment focused on why Jeff should be above criticism because he made significant contributions to bitcoin.


You're attacking a point that was never made. I never said that he was forcing anyone to do it, I never said that he shouldn't be allowed to do it. I simply called it disrespectful to professionals to devolve their field into contests.


Then he should be asking for professional designers to donate their time like he does, rather than asking them work for a chance at a "bounty". (How else do you define a contest, anyway? They're all essentially working for the chance to win something.) If he liked one entry in particular, there is nothing stopping him from giving that person a bonus.


And AGAIN, this was never brought up.




Yes... you were "specifically" referring to me and then when you denied referring to me you insult me further.


Fair enough. Really only 3 or 4 posts called him cheap though, and they were downvoted pretty fast. But given this remark in context with the rest of your posts, you are the last person that should be lecturing anyone on "respect". 
Now, if you'd like to address this, I *am* actually interested:

That seems to assume all CPUs have similar architectures - if you're designing to use most of the transistors on a chip in order to make ASIC production difficult, you'll constantly be chasing the goalpost of increasing transistor counts. Sure, maybe if you came out with a set of algos that required the majority of the resources on a Broadwell i7 it would be difficult to design in ASIC for it for a couple years... But what happens when the broadwell i7 is considered tiny and primitive? Imagine if you designed your set of hashing algorithms around a 3 million transistor count Pentium at 800nm in 1995... 20 years ago you would've had a hard time making a more efficient ASIC than the Pentium itself... but today it would be trivial. Not to mention the issues you'd run into trying to optimize this set of algos to work similarly on Intel, AMD, and ARM architectures.
My other issue, if we're trying to prevent centralization, is someone with the resources to have an ASIC designed also has the resources to buy a lot more CPUs than the average person. Likewise, by tying mining to popular CPU architectures, all we do is centralize the development of hashing hardware on Intel/AMD... whereas currently anyone can design an ASIC in their garage and have it fabbed if they have the knowledge.

Did you completely ignore the entire post you just replied to? Please educate yourself on spec work and why it hurts our industry:

Why does he have to approach an agency? Like I said in my other post, the right way to handle this would've been to ask for redditors that were interested and pick one based on their previous work, like any other service. Would you approach multiple tattoo artists, ask them to each do a piece on you, and then you'll decide which one to pay $200 to based on whose was best?
@_date: 2014-11-08 19:41:23
You spent a lot of time rambling about Jeff's contribution to an OSS project and not a lot of time addressing my point. I never insulted him, and just because he contributes to bitcoin does not make him "above" everyone else to the point that his behavior doesn't deserve criticism. I outlined in my previous reply why professionals take offense to posts like his.

The protocol doesn't define a $0.01 transaction fee at all.

Where did I say that he shouldn't be allowed to do this? I simply said it's disrespectful to professionals. Maybe we can just keep it to one thread.

You're the one failing to see the point. It's not about the rate. This is not a job, it is a contest. He's not asking for people who'd like to do the job, he is asking people to do the job for free and then he will decide whether to pay them for it.
Edit: The right way to do this would have been to post a thread asking for designers to submit their portfolios for a $200 job and pick one to do the work.

So the blog posts with no technical details of your own are encouraging a hard fork to prevent a slightly malicious hard fork that may or may not happen? I'm not sure why you think nodes would be forced to accept a "cartel's" chain, other than that it would be default. The payoff of a 51% attack, in all likelihood you'd need to control more than that to pull it off, is hardly worth the investment in mining hardware it would take. Yes, individual pools being above that is an issue, but surely not "armageddon".
@_date: 2014-12-26 00:44:11
You're a bit mistaken about the bitcoin protocol. You cannot force arbitrary changes to the protocol with 51% of the hashing power, nor can you stop transactions from being sent, only from being confirmed, nor can you change the block reward. You could starve other miners, and you can double-spend your own coins indefinitely. That's about it.

That's quite a stretch. Dual channel DDR3 has transfer rates of 20GB/s and response times around 100us. Not to mention SSDs have very short lifetimes when being constantly overwritten.

The use of SHA in bitcoin is mostly arbitrary, and could just as easily be replaced with any other hashing algorithm with a predictable computation time. And the only thing you can "crack" with the resulting hashes is a set of the same block of transaction data with random nonces (along with a couple other places the double sha hash is used) which doesn't seem that useful to the NSA. What makes you think this would be the case?

Because running an entire computer, with an outdated processor, is incredibly inefficient compared to what can be done with a low power embedded chipset.
@_date: 2015-03-18 02:12:56
Well, first, it's not a simple SHA-1 hash which is the widely employed function. Second, the only input to the miners is transaction data, which can be verified because the miner is open source. The government clearly doesn't control the mining hardware itself. What are you getting at?
Not to mention... the NSA developed SHA-1 in the first place, why would they have to crack their own algorithm when they could have simply backdoored a weak RNG or something?

@_date: 2015-03-18 02:22:04
Obviously you don't pick an insecure one, but the point is that the hashing algorithm is only used to create difficulty in calculating proof of work. You could just as easily use scrypt or others, which some altcoins have done.
