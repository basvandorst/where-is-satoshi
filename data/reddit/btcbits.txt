With only 21m bitcoins ever available, you have a chance to get enough coins to make it big if it succeeds. It can make us all the new elite. If you have money to buy maybe 10 coins I would recommend that more than buying 0.1. This is a once in a lifetime product, once in a lifetime chance.

I think "rights" sounds like a great word. 
Human rights
Powerful, mighty
To be the right one
Not a tec word but a strong word with a meaning

How do I collect it?

True, I bought bitcoin as my lottery ticket. I have a good feeling about it after a great 2014.

I think that to today :)
It's more like a ticket for the space rocket now.

I just want bitcoin to succeed. I'm not worried about the price at all, but it would be nice to have a little profit.
I hope the adoption continues as it has, it's been a very exciting year so far for me. Maybe 2014 resembles 2012 and we will see a very positiv outcome in the years to come. 
There's a lot more to bitcoin than just the price index. The adoption is happening right now and it's sure a fun ride. 
Just remember to buy, hold, use and talk bitcoin and we are almost there.

I'm a hodler to.

No, as long as me and my friends hodl our coins it will never be 0.00$. You can't turn the clock back to the beginning. The pandoras box has been opened. Deal with it.

Is that why the dollar is going to the moon at the moment?
i guess it will come down again with your reasoning.
