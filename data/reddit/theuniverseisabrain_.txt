You guys really know what happened right? When price was @ 15-16k and altcoins were at a low a few whales saw the opportunity and bought ton of BTC to do a rally on altcoins. Now same whales sold their buy-in and profit and price is again at 15-16k. It's not like is the 1st time it happened.

Ok, so what you're saying is take the international option. :up:

Wow, that's quite the ride. I can open an EUR account practically for free (0.5e/month fee). Are there any other taxes except the 0.9E transaction fee and currency exchange rip-offs?

ONE MONTH! Wtf they need one month for?

Great. Now the price will plummet like a rock.

So basically BU is another money-grab, like an altcoin, just on a bigger level and from what I've seen dangerous to bitcoin.

Thanks! Do you know if there is a wallet that lets me access my BCC using my passphrase? Something that doesn't require me to dld all blockchain.

Is there an online wallet or something like Electrum that doesn't require me to download all the blockchain where I can enter my key/passphrase to access my BCC?

So wait. If that video is right, If I have my coins in a private key, now I have BOTH coins? Aka twice the coins? At the same time? How do I get my BCC?
Because from what I first read I thought you have in your wallet your coins, but then you must choose if to move them in a wallet as BTC or as BCC, aka support BCC or BTC. So you don't actually have 2x the coins, but you must choose what coin to have.
Which is right?

You want the truth? So they make money out of it. That's the only fucking real reason for all the altcoins and this shit fork. And all the forks that will come. Money grabbing. All the technical stuff and other reasons they give to you are just this: bullshit. 
The biggest scams of all are the ICO/IPOs. They (the "devs") started with premines and then evolved to that.
The only coin that is for real and had some good intentions to it is Bitcoin. 
OT: If I remember correctly, there was an altcoin that had good intentions behind it and people worked for it. Noblecoin. Very little or no premine (I can't remember). And that's why it failed. No big kahunas to make money out of it. That coin showed me that only thing that matters is profit.
EDIT: And Doge. That was just for the LULZ.

Really no rush.. Bitfinex doesn't have BCC deposits yet, and Kraken has no open orders for BCC. Hah.
Any exchange I can sell my BCC on?

How can an exchange with an average of 0.2% fee, where over 30.000 BTC trades are done every day, be insolvent?
That's 60BTC/day in fees.
