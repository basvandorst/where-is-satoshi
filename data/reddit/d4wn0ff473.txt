This article is a yarn. A bitcoin loyalist who doesn't see the network and trade volume created by altcoins that bolster the network he so bullishly protects. If people were not bullish on altcoins, bitcoin would not nearly have the trade volume that it currently is operating with. I mine alts to get bitcoins so I can sit on the bitcoins. I would never spend fiat to invest directly in cryptocurrency nor would I ever invest in a bitcoin asic miner.   While the article may be right about bitcoin eventually winning out it also holds true that without altcoins this very quickly becomes a rich mans game that most people would not want to participate in. And from my experience so far it seems that there are people who want to lock the "commoners" out of their little world.

Exchanges are not to be trusted, they answer to a governing body, and if you really want to keep your funds safe keep them in your own wallet away from exchanges. This is the same reason people stuffed their mattresses with cash and kept it out of the banks.

The most common prediction by ~~notable economists~~ is $100,000 in 20 years. Not $500,000 in 5 years that is an over zealous prediction that can simply not play out based on the charts as they exist today.

Everyone that I have ever talked to about bitcoin I always throw out that it is not for the faint of heart. That you need to have excessive risk tolerance to get involved. And you can't cave the second you see a dip. My most recent advice has been that the market is about to go full bear once this latest bitcoin bubble implodes, that is the time to buy. Most of the same principles involved in traditional investing apply to btc, it's just ntimes more volatile. 
The other thing that I tend to give for advice is to actually read the white papers and understand what you are investing in and how to use it. This is really the single most important part of crypto investing. If you don't understand what you are buying how can you ever make decisions about what to do with it.

Kay Van-Petersen for one. He is a market analyst not an economist, but makes a living interpreting data from fiat based markets, and has been right in the past with his predictions. His prediction was in 10 years, but that in my perspective is too bullish given how easily bitcoin will walk sideways during times of uncertainty.
Raoul Pal is another analyst who has a similar point of view, he thinks the floor value is $100,000 because if you use the gold equivalent equation for the known total supply it should be worth 1mm a coin.
EDIT: notable analysts, I thought that van-petersen was an economist.


That is a legitimately dumb statement, or attempt to troll. There are plenty of people who watch the markets for a living and are paid to predict performance. There are definitely people who know more than random redditors squabbling about price potential.

Come on, anyone who really wants to believe that a 500k mark is realistic in 5 years is delusional. The charts direct otherwise, 100k is far more realistic in 20 years not 5. As the price grows it will start to walk sideways more frequently. The risk of loss will outweigh truly exponential growth and cause stagnation in growth, the deflationary value decreases risk, but does not change that when one btc is worth 20k people will avoid investing large amounts to avoid large losses in a singular crash.

This makes no sense, in order for the us government to redeem value from a bitcoin they have to introduce new money into the market to pay for the bitcoin. You cannot reduce the debt by introducing new money, you would simply grow the debt and expound the problem if the us government started buying or selling bitcoin. 
Fiat currency does not operate in the same method for the us government as it does for a singular citizen, and the analogy of home finances used broadly across the internet to simplify national budgets is a flat out incorrect analysis.
The only way that the us debt disappears is if something like bitcoin were to replace fiat based currency, but that is highly unlikely and an extremely naive approach to economics and the idea of debt backed currency in the first place.

The federal government is not legally able to retain property seized as part of a criminal investigation once the trial has finished and a verdict has been rendered. Unless the evidence would be admissible in an appeal or retrial it has to be auctioned off, by law. So no it's not a financial mistake, it is the government abiding by the rules they set forth. If they did not follow those rules an injunction could be filed against the federal government and there would have been a legal battle over the bitcoins. The same thing happened with the liberty dollar, but in the case of the liberty dollar since the coins were not used in a criminal act they were granted back to the original owners.

I'm aware of why civil asset forfeiture is controversial. My comment was in response to the op which is specifically about the silk road. Your response given the tone and vagueness of it seemed to be directed toward the overall conversation of the thread, not specifically targetting a discussion about asset forfeiture as a tool in the "war" on drugs.

I would think they would want you to keep your animal healthy as well.

So you think that someone who chooses to educate themselves (which shows motivation) rather then get a degree (which shows restraint) should be shown skepticism in an interview, but the person with the degree has already proved their value without skepticism?
Don't both candidates deserve the same amount of skepticism, or does the person with the "education" deserve less? 
This is the problem with degrees, it lets people with shit qualifications get into jobs they shouldn't be doing. College degrees are the worst Nepotistic thing present in the normal social construct that everyone deals with on a regular basis. Oh you went to school x, so did I here is a job completely unqualified candidate A. Oh candidate B who doesn't have a degree but is self educated and way smarter than candidate A you can go pound sand enjoy working at McDonalds.

As I said in other posts and in a previous reply to you, I am not without a traditional education. I will just copy my other comment to end this, because you seem to buy into social norms while trying to be respectful of peoples choices even if you don't agree with them, which is part of the problem with your perspective. You still buy into this idea that people who are not educated in a traditional system are lesser people who deserve to be treated with a lower value in terms of their social position. In other words treated with kid gloves because you think they don't understand what you understand.
Previous comment to another reply.


In addition to this, this straw man position creates a false narrative that those people are only making those decisions because they don't understand what that decision means or what impact it will have. The person making the original comment cannot know that this is the case and cannot know why people are making the decisions they do. Statistics about education and the uneducated are about traditional education not about people who educate themselves in their reading room or basement. So when someone is saying uneducated and using a statistical analysis they are referring to traditional methods of educating a populace. Furthermore this is a terrible narrative which is driving our current social norm of flying the accountability plane into the mountain.

This isn't about lack of critical thinking skills as a problem here. I think its more that the goals of group A do not align with the goals of group B.

I am not against adjusting the ecosystem, but the amount of technical understanding a person needs to correctly and properly protect their coins is not something that you can just simply teach someone how to do if they are technologically illiterate.
There are many different clients, how do you choose the right one does this company advocate for using online clients or for using clients you control? Do they advocate for using cold storage paper wallets? Are they running their own storage solution similar to a credit union or bank where your money deposited is guaranteed by bitcoin and you can pay with debit cards etc? Are they using an investment trust that guarantees you a ratio of a coin per investment share? Bitcoin is not truly ready for less technical people, none of the existing clients or technology is comprehensible by the majority of the general public. There is more than a large learning curve associated with it. 
The question about selling computers to technically illiterate people is dead on arrival, most of the time the people selling the computers in places like best buy know as much as the person they are selling to and are told to target the highest priced machine in the facility to up sell the consumer, but don't sell them the alienware unless they ask for it that may scare them away. If you can sell them an $1000 computer when they are asking for an $600 computer then you should pursue the higher priced model. Use language like this model has more ram, and the hardrive is larger so you will not run out of space. Avoid language that may confuse the customer like comparisons of processor type and speed, or discussion of the brand of motherboard. If a customer has a specific question such as what brand is the motherboard? please take them to the web kiosk and consult the company website for further information. 
Electrical retailers do not educate their customers they bait and switch them and then sell them warranties on spyware removal and other trivial tasks like hard drive reformatting, or OS install. Companies like apple charge $350 to install a new hard drive when the drive is $50 and the work takes ten to fifteen minutes tops. 
Now there is an off chance you will get a half decent intelligent person who works there who will be honest, but they are rare and not trained that way by the company. Also don't get me started on how the repair departments operate to screw people out of hundreds of dollars for things they don't need. 
If you are equating selling less technical people a computer to selling them a bitcoin I would hope that there would be less predatory practices afoot. But alas there are not the Gbtc investment trust sells 0.1 btc at a steep premium in comparison to just buying 0.1 btc yourself. Currently $418 per share which represents 0.1 btc, that's the price of being technologically illiterate, you get insulated from the real market and taken advantage of by the smarter people.

Just look to the original poster that I replied to. They proved my point for me. There is one of those '"people"??' and there are many more you just have to pay attention. 
In a Society where the degree is king for methods of truly gainful employment I find it somewhat laughable that you are even making this argument. If we really valued people who educated themselves and looked at education through that broad of a spectrum then there would be no need for degree requirements when looking for work etc. The majority of society is designed to look down on and demean those who are not "educated." 
Everything is structured in a way to take advantage of the disadvantaged, and that wont change as long as they are promised and believe that things will be fixed in their favor. So sure the original poster was right about the belief of lies, it just depends which lie you want to believe and if that construct is something that you want to be a part of. Real world or farce.

Does that person who barely uses email and only uses an ancient nokia phone know how to sweep the keys on that paper wallet to get their money out? Or do they need assistance with that? 
My point is not that non technical people cannot or should not use it, its that the entry level bar needs to be lowered for the general public to freely use it. A brick and mortar shop does not do that, even with help and advice it still keeps the same bar of entry. It needs to be as easy as buying a leather wallet for fiat notes on amazon. We are not there yet, and it will not be there for sometime. This technology is still in its infancy, and with most technology on the bleeding edge of technological society it takes years if not decades to get integrated properly for regular people to use it. In home networking took 30 years to get right so that joe lunchpail can get a plug and play router that just works. 
Its great that you are helping people move through the ecosystem, but don't be deluded into believing that it is ready for regular people to use on the level that visa or master card processes digital fiat transactions. As a community we are still fighting about ways to scale the network to handle only a fraction of the potential transactions that happen on those networks daily. I always tell everyone that I discuss btc with that this ecosystem is like penny stocks in 1986 on steroids, you need exceptionally high risk tolerance.
So no I don't believe that people should be prevented from being interested or using btc, but I do not think that the general public is ready for it, and I do not think it is ready for the general public. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 20:55:53

Quite the contrary, I am not insecure about anything. I am educated under the social norm of what being educated is. I am just really sick and tired of people jumping on others for being "uneducated". No one knows what is informing the decisions people make, and frankly attempting to use education as a justification for terrible decisions is not a legitimate reason for anything. It gives a free pass to people which allows them to not be held accountable for what they do because they are perceived to not be as smart as you are. Not only is that a smug position to take it is a straw man position to take. It is a propagation of lack of accountability because that person wants to feel superior to the person making the poor decision.

This conversation is completely about the UX of bitcoin. My original comment is that it is pointless and given the nature of bitcoin I still have the same position. I want non technical people to take the leap to understand bitcoin, not the other way around. A brick and mortar is not the solution, reading the white papers and joining the community at large is the solution. The more people who understand it, the more people get involved which benefits the ecosystem. That is how it benefits you and I, otherwise they are white noise on the trade market which may as well be pointless speculation on oil barrels, it adds nothing to the bitcoin community.

The original statement in my original reply is not anecdotal. When people want to discuss education they do not talk about the grandpa who couldn't afford college who knew practically everything because he read all the time and even into his old age kept up to date with as much as he could, nor do they recommend that lifestyle. Instead they talk about what degrees will be relevant to their life and how they can pursue a better life by earning a degree. These are the people who will throw out the uneducated quip. They use it as a buffer against their own ignorance, as a weapon to win an argument. A person who is not formally educated but is significantly more intelligent than a person with a formal education will not use this quip, because they are already smarter than that person and do not need to degrade them.

This is stupid. Buy apple stock become an investor in their company. Then you have a voice in stockholder meetings. You can raise your concerns and then get moving on a solution. Petitions by people who mindlessly buy shiny shitty products are meaningless.
And for anyone who wants to combat this because you are all over Apple's nuts. Apple is an authoritarian company that says it knows what you need and instead of unlocking thier source and giving you control over your mobile products, you are instead forced to keep it the way they want it. Apps cannot be authorized for use on the iPhone or iPad without prior approval through apple. If you jailbreak your product to use it in a free and open manner you can be fined heavily and may go to jail, this should tell you enough about apple's business practices to not want to get involved in cryptocurrency storage on an apple mobile product.
Bitcoin and all cryptocurrency is supposed to be about an open deregulated world currency that is not controlled by any source. The last place that anyone should want to put their currency is on a mobile device controlled by a company like apple where you do not actually own the device, and using it to its full potential for all intents and purposes is illegal.
