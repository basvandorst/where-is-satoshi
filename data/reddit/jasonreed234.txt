 You don't win or lose until you sell. 
Selling after the 2013-2017 gains in order to eliminate debt is, in my mind, a sensible idea. 
Good work and congrats on holding this long!

Quick question: do traditional stocks work the same way? Do they have buy and sell walls and that is how the price is determined?
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:45:52
Exactly. It makes it more relatable. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:08:19
Oh no.

Same with copies of Shrek 3 on DVD. If you have a few copies lying around, it's cool. If you have like a hundred, people start treating you differently.

Yes, but there is no public record for the path that every paper dollar has lived. (That would be really cool though)

The article states that because 45% of Venezuelans (about 15 million) will be able to use Bitcoin, the price will rise to $15,000 or $20,000. 
This could be a huge step for cryptos, but IMO it's overly optimistic.
