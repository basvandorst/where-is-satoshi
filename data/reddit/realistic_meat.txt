Good for you. No point in being embarrassed by something that makes other people laugh. Or cringe.

Are you joking?

There is already complete surveillance of where your money is going to and coming from if it's not cash. There has been for years.
This is simply a way to add an extra layer to warn people of scams.

I checked your post history and you haven't posted about any of those things. Why are you waiting for other people to do it?

Don't take investing advice from someone who is rich enough that they'd still be rich if they didn't follow their own advice. Even if he dumped all of his BTC he'd still be a billionaire.
Also, it's not like he always made the best investments. He was a big early investor in Theranos, who's CEO was indicted for fraud because the company was a complete sham.

I sure hope you transferred that BTC to a new wallet because it wouldn't be hard to identify the wallet it's in from the partial change addresses you have there...
Obviously brute forcing the private key or seed is still pretty hard, but by giving up your password you have no password anymore.

I know people who bought into Grayscale Trust because that was the only way they could use money in their IRA to buy Bitcoin. Or at least the easiest way. They said the premium was worth it because otherwise they'd have to take a tax hit and penalty for pulling cash out of their IRA.
Unfortunately, it was a really REALLY bad move.

I agree that cryptocurrency is the killer application for blockchain, but Bitcoin is one of the least efficient ones out there. Proof of work has no future. It was a great initial implementation, but Bitcoin won't keep the lead as  cryptocurrency as long as proof of work is required to confirm transactions.

Same here. Last year around this time when Bitcoin went up over $8k, my dad asked if I should buy some. I told him I own some but I bought it long ago and I wouldn't buy it at that price, so no. Then a month later it was up over $20k and he yelled at me for telling him not to buy it. I told him I stand by my advice.
I'm still waiting for him to call me and tell me I was right... except now if he asks if he should buy some I'd say yes. LOL.

My average buy-in price is about $400 and I'm not worried at all.
And before you accuse me of not booking profits, I cashed out about 10x more than my initial investment by selling off my BCH after it forked. I got lucky by selling near the peak at $4k.

How would you make an HTPC from a miner? They usually don't have video output. Their general processor is likely too slow to decode video streams anyway. And there's no storage. These things are completely useless for anything other than cryptocurrency mining.
A while ago I thought about getting one for brute forcing password hashes for a research project and they can't even do that. They are very specialized machines.

Smart? The dude wants to cash out 20% of his BTC to buy a new car and go on vacation.
Also, $500k isn't the amount of wealth you'd need for it to make sense to "invest" in art. Maybe property. But really, I'd split 50/50 in cryptocurrency and the stock market if I were OP. And no fucking Tesla. The vacation is legit, though. Treat yo self.
$500k is the start of a nice nest egg, not a windfall that's big enough to retire on. It's a good head start, but that's it.

Yes, because he's a scammer who's only in the cryptocurrency space to get rich. If it doesn't make him rich he'll try something else.

There is a lot of stuff that's "bad" about making these posts.
First of all, you were caught altering screenshots and messages. That's something that can be easily proven in court. If you are guilty of some type of illegal activity, this will hurt you. If you are completely innocent, it still makes you look sketchy. Why do this? What are you trying to accomplish by lying other than to tarnish Binance's reputation?
Second, any reputable lawyer will tell you to not make any public statements. If you actually have hired a lawyer, and I doubt you did, you should fire them immediately if they didn't tell you to shut up and explain why you should shut up.
If your plan is just to make Binance look bad, you're failing hard because I have more respect for them after reading your posts and their responses than I did before. They are handling this professionally. You are changing your story, not answering questions, and not explaining the actions you've taken.

There's nothing at all that says you can't build a bank around bitcoin as a currency. Nothing about bitcoin prevents you from holding someone's bitcoin, lending it out to collect interest, and then paying interest to the depositors. That's the essential function of a bank.

With a regime like that in charge, plausible deniability doesn't help you. If they want you dead they'll find something to accuse you with and come up with evidence.
Anyone thinking any cryptocurrency or encryption could keep you safe in this situation is a moron.
Plausible deniability is only an asset when your government respects the rule of law, not a dictatorship where people are executed at will for whatever reason the government comes up with.

What a garbage article. PayPal and Square aren't "traditional methods" of transferring large sums of money.
Companies don't use PayPal or Square to transfer hundreds of million dollars. They send it directly between bank accounts via wire transfer, it happens instantly, and it costs them nothing.

I'm not who you replied to, but Aaron Swartz was an academic who wanted information to be free. He had principles and he broke the law in accordance with those principles. He made many contributions to the community to further his cause.
Ross Ulbrict is just some dude who wanted to get rich by running an online drug marketplace. He didn't really give a shit about ideals or making the world a better place. He didn't contribute anything at all to the community other than throwing together a shitty php website that let people trade drugs for bitcoin. To him, cryptocurrency was just a tool to make money as a middleman in an illegal black market.
It's pretty insulting to compare the two.

If BTC hits $85k USD at any time by December 31, 2021, I will eat a sandwich.
Fuck it, I'll eat TWO sandwiches.

Eh, I've been investing in stocks for 20 years (through 3 major crashes/bear markets) and I've been holding bitcoin for 4. I ain't worried about shit.
This isn't even the first time I've seen BTC drop 80% and I watched stocks drop 30-50% a few times too.
Don't get all smug, kid. Most people with significant investments in the stock market have seen more crashes than you.

When I think of "Hacker News" I still think of "Hacker News Network" run by one of the L0pht guys that was around long before the Y Combinator thing.
"The Hacker News" is some bullshit blog.

You know the difference between what the 1% does that you aren't doing? Working their asses off. Or at least the ones that earned their spot in the top 1% instead of being born into it.
Don't plan on getting there just by dumping all of your savings into a single investment and hoping it works out. You are essentially relying on only luck instead of what gets most people there - luck and hard work.
