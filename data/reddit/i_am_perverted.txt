@_date: 2013-11-18 16:57:21
Fuck that, I'll use whatever word I want...you seem cool, but not cool enough to make people change their vocab.
Doubt we got mutuals, but your friends list is private so who knows.
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:07:13
I never claimed it would.  I was making a "best case" scenario.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:49:18
Buddy, you're wrong. Get over it.
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:06:41
Cool way of thinking about it.  Thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:28:16
Not sure if asshole or just a piece of shit.  Grow the fuck up, prick.  
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:25:21
Please read this slowly, because I don't know how to make it any simpler:
Terrorists can benefit from BitCoin because it is a way to transfer funds anonymously with no trace at all.  
Silk Road is an example of Bitcoin being used for illegal activities.  It'd be foolish to believe that it hasn't been extended to terrorist groups.
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:22:40
You're completely forgetting that things can also be cheap or expensive relative to time.
It's a lot cheaper for me to buy a 1TB hard drive than it was 2 years ago.
You understand?
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:08:40


You seem to be very misled.  Reddit is a discussion forum.  That's exactly what we are doing.  Discussing this.


Right, and if someone has an idea, they are more than welcome to bring it up.  Simple.
As for the rest of your statement, I'm not arguing against any of that or than that it is absolutely easier for most people to understand "six hundred and forty microbits" than "six hundred and forty millionths of a bitcoin."
It appears you're just arguing to read your own writing (hear yourself speak) or are very confused as to what it is that I'm suggesting be done.  I'm simply saying that it would be extremely convenient if the people who run the big exchanges and purchasing mediums (ATMs, Coinbase, etc), used uBTC, as that's exactly what you're going to use when you go about purchasing anything useful in the real world such as a bike, keyboard, or phone with Bitcoin.
Simple, familiar, and friendly.  That's what Bitcoin needs to be if it is going to survive.
I'm not saying it's the ONLY way you should refer to Bitcoin, but it should be come the most common nomenclature if we are going to continue to promote this cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2013-12-03 02:54:43
Same. This image is a scam!
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:29:16


Exactly.  I am saying that I would be happy if they are not using Bitcoin.  I am not a fan of terrorists benefiting from such great ideas.
It's really basic logic.
For example: I would not be disappointed if terrorists never used guns and used them to kill (their intended purpose).  I would be happy if terrorists did not have guns. I own guns for fun and personal defense and support them if they're in the hands of law-abiding citizens.  I do not support them in the hands of terrorists, even though their intended purpose is to kill / disable.
Same with Bitcoin.  I understand that terrorists are *going* to  use them, but that doesn't mean I will be disappointed if they don't.  I will be happy if terrorists don't use them and they are only used by good people.
I really don't understand how you aren't following this.
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:57:19
Terrorism is one the major selling points of Bitcoin?
You said you'd be disappointed if terrorists aren't using BitCoin (making terrorism more widespread, easy, and potentially deadly).  I said I'd be unhappy...because I don't like it when innocent people die.
Maybe your love of money is greater than your love of human life?
I have bitcoin, I promote bitcoin, and I intend to use bitcoin more and more as it becomes a way to pay for goods and services.  That doesn't mean I'm happy when terrorists use it.  Do you follow?
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:43:15
Again, thanks for admitting you're a bad person.  
By the way, it's spelled *effect*.
@_date: 2013-11-15 20:47:02
I hope you're right.  Mind are scheduled to arrive Monday.
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:48:21
Just because you weren't alive doesn't mean that you aren't allowed to have a preference on whether or not it happened.  You prefer that it did happen if it means that you'd make a few bucks.
Again, it's spelled "its."
Also, it's spelled "what's."
The point is so that you don't look like a fool by not understanding the language that you're using.
Wy donnt wee al'l j-ust tawlk liiek dis...u undurstand whut eim sayin', rite?  Noh bigg deel?
You've proven yourself to be a sociopath, extremely selfish, completely free of empathy, and you put the value of money over the value of people.  Thank you for proving who you are.  I'm moving on now.  You may have the last word; you're welcome.
Have a good one.  I really hope one day you grow up and learn that your money isn't more important than human life.  Otherwise, I wish you the best as you live and die lonely.
@_date: 2013-11-27 12:47:47
Don't you mean Greek? 
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:15:03
You asked "how?"
As in "how can it be used for terrorism?"
I provided the answer to this question.  It can be used in the same way Silk Road and The Armory used it.
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:15:11
It sure was.  It's almost like you're new to this website!
Anyway, getting us back on track.  You are complaining because people are discussing an idea, right?  Saying that we shouldn't discuss it but instead just email the dev, right?
I responded with:
*I don't see what the big deal is either. We are having a discussion here on if it makes sense and gathering an idea of how popular the idea is before going to a dev. It makes more sense to say "Hey Dev, it turns out a lot of people want this! Care to implement it?"*
*Let it go. No one is fighting you on anything. It's just a discussion.*
You responded childishly saying I was "emailing" you instead of actually addressing my point, so I'll just take that as you've conceded your argument and agree with me.  Have a good one, bud.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:59:19
mustyoshi said that bitcoin probably is being used for terrorism.
You asked how.
I explained how.
What about this is confusing to you?
AML regulations do not apply to people exchanging money through bitcoins privately, and you can buy bitcoins with cash.  Do you not know how bitcoin works?
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:37:48
Again, you'd rather have random people die than lose money on your meager investments.
That's been settled, and proves you're a bad person.  Have a nice day.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:54:47
I never claimed it did.  I am sure you'll continue to be a bad person because money is more important to you than innocent people like those that died in the WTC attacks.  If you had the opportunity to stop that attack from happening, but it meant you'd lose some of your investment, you wouldn't stop it.
It's just nice to know what kind of person I was dealing with, that's all.  It helps take the things you say into context.
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:20:36
You should be sorry.  That's a sad life.
@_date: 2013-11-28 02:41:20
Why is that?  Lack of miners?  High difficulty?  I admit I don't fully understand.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:54:50
I have 1.5 bitcoins because I was too stupid to invest earlier and I spend all of my money on fun stuff.  I'll be dedicating a part of my income to purchasing BTC from here on though, since I think the wave is still growing.
@_date: 2013-11-28 02:52:45
Thanks.  Don't you think this pretty much destroys bitcoins feasibility as a useful currency in real life situations?  No one is going to want to sit there for 30 minutes waiting for a single confirmation.  It's just not realistic when credit cards are instant.
Litecoin cuts this time by 1/4, but it still seems like a lot of time to just sit there waiting to be confirmed.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:02:10
I'm talking about "terrorists" here.  The word that *you* used.  I didn't use the word.  You did.
What group, exactly, did you imply when you said terrorists?
Let's get this over with because you're clearly really struggling here to weasel out of your own words.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:40:01
Haha thanks for the optimism :-)  I really hope you're right!
@_date: 2013-11-25 23:59:25
You're saying the people that died in the 9/11 attacks didn't exist?
You're saying that the people who died from the suicide attack via suicide vest didn't exist?
You're saying that the people in Oklahoma who died from the Unibomber didn't exist?
You're saying that the children that died in terrorist attacks in Palestine didn't exist?
You're worse than I thought.
Next you'll be saying the holocaust was a lie.

I don't see what the big deal is either.  We are having a discussion here on if it makes sense and gathering an idea of how popular the idea is before going to a dev.  It makes more sense to say "Hey Dev, it turns out a lot of people want this!  Care to implement it?"
Let it go.  No one is fighting you on anything.  It's just a discussion.

No one forced you to do anything, asshole.  I'm sorry I missed it in the FAQ.  So much for this being a positive community with dolts like you in it, eh?  Hopefully one day you grow the fuck up and learn to act like an adult instead of being a prick to people just because you're anonymous on the internet and having a bad day.  You're pathetic and a coward.
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:23:06
Yes, I saw what you were struggling to do with your response.  It failed.
I'll repeat myself for you, bud:
I never said that I'd be disappointed if my tax money was not used for needless wars.
mustyoshi said he'd be disappointed if bitcoin wasn't used for terrorism.


Then he wouldn't have called them terrorists.  You might want to go actually read our discussion before continuing, because you're way off track.
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:29:45
Not all merchants have gift cards and it's a huge pain in the ass to use a gift card instead of just using the currency I want.  You mean a Visa gift card?  Yea, those have fees.  No thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:37:28
Hahaha I don't know what world you're living in, but people compare the relative prices of things over time quite a bit.
I'm astonished that you actually think that you can only refer to things being "cheap" or "expensive" in relation to other current items.  You're joking, right?
How would you compare the price of a 1TB HDD today versus a 1TB HDD in 2009?  Would you say that the price has increased or decreased?
Would you say that an apple is cheaper or more expensive than a 3D printer?  Would you say that 3D printers, today, are more or less costly than 3D printers a year ago?
I'm really blown away that you actually think this way.  :-)
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:52:53
I'll add ya.  You seem like a decent asshole.
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:31:55
Depends.  Is it a BLT or a grilled cheese?
@_date: 2013-11-26 02:27:24
It's fair to say bitcoin is cheap relative to its future potential value in relation to itself and fiat.
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:35:50
So now you're arguing semantics of the word "terrorism?"  Yes, it's used as a buzzword, but terrorism *absolutely* exists.  Are you seriously saying it doesn't?  Are you that wrapped up in yourself?
Again, you'd be **happy** if terrorists benefit from using Bitcoin.  This has been settled.  Thank you for proving to me that you hold your money more dearly than the safety of innocent people.  You'd rather make a few bucks and have real terrorism flourish than lose a few bucks and protect innocent lives.
You'd do well working at Bank of America or JP Morgan.
Unreal.  Quit trying to argue against everything just for the sake of arguing.  You're embarrassing yourself.

Oh I see what you're saying
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:31:06

@_date: 2013-11-21 14:31:40
There's a big difference between having empathy for random people (which I do) and being disappointed that people aren't dying so that you can make a few extra bucks.
Again, it must be a lonely life when you put money over people.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:40:39

How is it "old news?"  It is from today.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:14:37
I asked you a question and you dodged it.  Nice job.
You are the one that said you'd be disappointed if terrorist aren't using Bitcoin.  What group were you referring to?
You're clearly now just trying to undefine the word terrorism to save face, and you're failing.
How do you not understand my response that I'd be HAPPY if terrorists don't use Bitcoin, because I don't support the harm of innocent people.
Let me ask you this: if the perpetrators of the 9/11 attack had the opportunity to use Bitcoin (as opposed to a traceable purchasing method), and their use of Bitcoin was the reason they were not found, would you be disappointed if they did not use it?
If the people responsible for exploding a roadside bomb next to a children's hospital used Bitcoin to stay anonymous (and would have been caught if they hadn't used Bitcoin), would you have been disappointed if they didn't use it?
I'm excited to see how you weasel out of this one.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:56:46
That doesn't make any sense.  I pay taxes because I support education, roads, infrastructure, airports, public programs, etc.  I am fully aware that tax money also goes into needless wars, but I don't get to choose where my money goes.
That said, I would not rather have children die needlessly than have my investments succeed.  That's the ultimate selfishness.
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:13:39
I don't think you understand the picture.  The people who don't walk away are going to fall into the pit along with the person behind the podium.
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:40:15
Did you?  Looks the same to me.
@_date: 2013-11-26 13:32:52
Yes, welcome to Reddit.  When you say something to someone, expect a response.  That's how discussions work.  If you don't want a response, then don't write back.
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:52:49
Yes, but terrorism does imply that you are out to hurt innocent people.
Let's stay on track here and stop trying to weasel out of what you said.
You said you'd be happy to hear that terrorists are using Bitcoin.
Your reasoning for this is because you stand to make money from it.
Therefore, you support making money more than you care about innocent people.
This is very basic stuff.
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:51:22

You already messed it up.  It's 100 BTC, not 1000, for .0001 uBTC.
It's "literally" not as easy.  People do not speak in terms of .0001.  I can say "one hundred" or "one thousand" or "ten."  People don't say "one thousandths" or "one hundredth" or "five ten-thousandths" in everyday use when speaking about money.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:03:34
Yea, that's the one I Google-fu'ed to find, along with your twitter, etc.
About to add it.

@_date: 2013-11-28 02:54:48
Do you mind explaining?  Sorry for being such a rookie.  I should obviously know this since I have money in bitcoin right now.  I know you can buy instantly on Coinbase, but how do you do instant transactions from address to address without being confirmed on the blockchain?
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:17:51
It's all of the USD money in circulation.  I urge you to remain civil if you want to discuss this.

Look at that ugly fake fucking orange tan.
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:22:22
Right, and if it meant that you could have made a few thousand bucks when the holocaust happened, you'd prefer that it did.
Again, you've stated that you'd rather have people die (which you rationalize with saying these people "don't exist") than lose a few bucks on your investments.  It's sociopathic, shows a complete lack of empathy, and is truly sad.  I really feel bad for you.
By the way, it's spelled "its."
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:49:35
What program did you use to do this?
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:41:53
I foresaw the crash and sold. I've been wrong before, but this time I was right. No need to get all defensive about it. China was acting weird and the hype was dying, and the value had stopped growing.
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:13:38
I never said anything that contends this.
It's clear that you don't understand what it is is that's being argued or discussed here.
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:44:11
Are you claiming that Bitcoin is not being used by terrorists in any way?
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:44:34
Then make me a gluten-free sandwich.  Did I give you permission to talk back?
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:58:30
You clearly are not understanding the basics of this conversation.
I would not be DISAPPOINTED to hear that terrorists are using bitcoin  However, I definitely want bitcoin to succeed.  It's extremely basic stuff.
I'm not HAPPY to hear innocent people are being hurt.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:27:38
If all $1.2 trillion USD were converted to the max 21 million Bitcoins ever allowed, and the price of goods didn't change, each Bitcoin would be worth about $57,000.  This will never happen, of course.  It won't even happen to the 1/5 level, in my opinion (one fifth of currency in the USA used being bitcoin).  This means that it's very unlikely to ever hit $10,000...
This is only using the US dollar and not the rest of the money in the world, but it's something to think about.
Then again, I could very well be thinking about this all wrong.
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:53:06
Strange, because I'd be happy.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:44:30
Yep, and he just said this:
@_date: 2013-11-25 12:58:04
You're wrong.
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:59:17
Are you saying Silk Road did not exist?  Are you saying The Armory did not exist?
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:49:23
Not sure why you talk about being able to afford one, either. You don't buy them in integer amounts.
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:31:55
What do you mean how?  By providing an untraceable way to exchange money.  I love bitcoin and really hope it succeeds, but don't pretend that it won't also be used in negative ways at the same time.  Just like Silk Road.
Please don't feign ignorance or lie to yourself that nothing bad can happen or does happen with BitCoin just because you have a financial stake in it.  That's exactly the kind of things that the people who fuck you over with dollars do.
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:06:47
Darn.  Someone should donate.  I want to be rich too.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:21:33


That's not what a strawman is.  It was a question.  I was seeking clarification.  Please learn what logical fallacies are.


What the hell are you talking about?  I own Bitcoin as well.  That is a strawman.


I didn't use the word terrorism.  He did.  Don't lecture me on buzzwords.  
Do you need me to give you an overwhelming list of events that both of us would agree are terrorist in their action?  Blowing up a children's hospital, suicide bomb in a farmer's market, etc...don't give me this "terrorism doesn't exist" garbage, kiddo.
As for the rest of your reply, it's clear that you have absolutely no idea what it is that I'm saying or arguing against / for.  You rambled on a bunch of talking points you've heard over the past few weeks without actually understanding that no one is disputing what you're saying. 
You're way off track and clearly confused about what it is that's being discussed here.
Again, I have bitcoin.  I support bitcoin.  You're barking up the wrong tree here, champ.
edit: Just so you know the kind of person you're defending here: 
@_date: 2013-11-12 20:52:20
What do you mean cold storage?  
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:32:52
It makes you a bad person to prefer that innocent people than you lose a few bucks.
It's really sad, and says a lot about you, that you don't even think anything's wrong with that.  You would kill people if it means you could make a hundred bucks per person.
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:08:00
They don't accept bitcoin...damn.  Oh well.  At least Litecoin is doing really well right now!  I have 22 of those bad boys.

So again, you value money over human life.  Thanks for verifying that.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:24:13
Thank you.  You've just said it right there.  You'd rather that the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks had gone free than lose a couple bucks because your investment isn't increasing in value.
Your way of thinking is what has the world in the mess of wars we are in in the first place.  Your way of thinking is the same logic used when going to war to find oil.  You'd rather have people die than not make some money.
Thank you for finally admitting you're a bad person.  It takes a lot and I'm happy you've come to terms with it.
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:13:03


No you may not, because I never said that I'd be disappointed if my tax money was not used for needless wars.  
mustyoshi said he'd be disappointed if bitcoin wasn't used for terrorism.
Do you see the difference?  Do you need me to hold your hand through this still?
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:33:15
Again, thanks for proving you're a sociopath.  It doesn't matter if you're the one pulling the trigger, but you're the one supporting the death of innocent people so you make a few bucks.
It's sad that you have to convince yourself that those people don't even EXIST to live with how horrible of a person you are.
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:53:39
his right what?
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:52:17
I agree.  There are people that you'll never meet...and it's fine that you don't think about them or concern yourself with them.
However, you admitted you'd rather those people die than live if it meant you'd get a few bitcoins.  
Again, you'd rather innocent people die than lose a few bucks.  You've established this about yourself.
@_date: 2013-11-25 11:11:26
DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.  VERY SHADY BUSINESS PRACTICES.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:09:37
Where did I use a strawman?  Do you even know what that means?  He said that he would be disappointed if terrorists aren't using Bitcoin.  Period.
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:33:13
who is bum?
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:52:37
Great, the next time I want to become a major trading authority with Iran, I can use gold!  Doesn't really help make your point
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:05:50
I don't see it in the FAQ, but I could be missing it.
@_date: 2013-11-25 23:49:15
Keeps emailing you?  I haven't emailed you.  I don't even know your email address.  What in the world are you talking about?  You mean I'm replying to you on Reddit?  Yea, that's how this site works.  Welcome to Reddit.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:23:07
27 days is very new ;-)
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:25:54
I don't think you understand that as the percentage of bitcoins used in transactions goes up, the value goes down ;-)
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:14:15
That's another interesting way to think about it...except I don't know any merchants that accept gold as payment.
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:38:24
At no point did I suggest we change "BTC" to mean 1 millionth (or anything else) of what BTC is right now.
You are very confused.
I'm simply saying that promoting the use of uBTC as opposed to BTC in  daily use, exchanges, and purchasing mediums will be extremely beneficial for everyone, *especially* new adopters of this currency.
Again, the way bitcoin is used should be as friendly and familiar as possible if we want its popularity to increase.  uBTC provides a great way to do this, as the markets are starting to prove that everyday use of BTC simply won't be compatible with the number of leading zeros needed to buy a sandwich.
This was proven by your mistaking of 1000 and 100.
@_date: 2013-11-25 13:01:18


Yes, if you're a sociopath and/or schizophrenic.
Then again, you've already proven yourself to be one by admitting you'd kill innocent people for money.
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:21:36
That seems like the reasonable thing to do.
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:12:51
This subreddit is growing every day, and so is the use of Bitcoin.  As popularity grows, the ideas surrounding it should be revisited and revised.
If it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out.  Your day wasn't made any worse by people having a discussion.  Quit trying to silence people.
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:49:53
I wish you the best. I plan on buying when it is low, so no need for the lecture.
@_date: 2013-11-28 02:43:35
Don't you think this presents a huge problem for the feasibility of Bitcoin as an everyday, usable currency?  Who is going to sit there for this long waiting for their transaction to get confirmed when they are buying a sandwich or a pizza?
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:31:23
Shut up and go make me a sandwich.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:49:12
Fuck, I want to hate you, but you're making it so god damn difficult!
You look at lot like Chris Angel, by the way.  I bet you get that a lot.
If you're ever in the KBTV area and want a tour in a C172, give me a holler.
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:23:19
Yea I read that.  It explains confirmations but doesn't answer the question.  It sounds like you'd just need to use a zero-confirmation transaction.
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:24:01
It's a suggestion for ease of use, not a suggestion for regulation or anything forced.
I'd personally rather buy something with 100 uBTC than with .0001 BTC.  It'd be too easy to mix up a decimal place.
