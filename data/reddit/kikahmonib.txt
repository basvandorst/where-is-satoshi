Limited supply and ever increasing demand. If x person buys btc at $10 and then y person wants to come on board but it late to the game, so he ends up paying more $100. The value of X btc now is realistically up to $100 because of people like Y that we’re willing to pay more. If the price comes down to $50 and both x and y sell, this money gained for x (from $10 to $50) is actually from person y. Person  loses $50 (from 100 to 50). If the price goes up to $150, it just means there was a person z that was willing to spend even more, hence increasing the price for first adopters. 
This man is right, no money will come from thin air. Any gains you make, will mean someone was willing to spend more than you on bitcoin hence increasing your own value through his payments.
If people stopped buying bitcoin (demand goes down), you coin prices will go down because no $$ is being pumped into bitcoin. Early adopters would try to cash out and make as much gains, but the more people cash out and make gains (pretty much from new investors that decided to invest when it was 19k$),the lesser the gains will become, hence the downward push on price. 
The biggest two factors playing a favour on bitcoin price going up right now is its finite amount, and it’s increasing cost to mine it. Higher cost will mean down the road more expensive bitcoin.
You can’t calculate it on a person lost person gain basis cause it’s a network of millions of people. But to sum up the value of the bitcoin network is made up of how much people are will to spend on this technology. The value of bitcoins bought in 2011 only appreciated because people bought in for way higher prices in the following years, and that’s how early adopters make most the money, hence the Ponzi scheme reference pointed out earlier.

There isn’t 21 million bitcoins out in the wild yet. This should after the year 2100 based on hashing power halfing every 4 years

Pyramid scheme would be a better word. It just means people on top make the most money (through people pumping massive amount of $$ at the bottom of the pyramid). The value of bitcoin won’t go up if people stopped buying it. Every new tier of buyers, adds more value to previous hodlers. It’s a new kind of pyramid scheme because the money, is the asset, is the product, is the technology. People believe in the technology(unlike pyramid schemes where you sell a worthless product to be part of the system and make money), that’s why people will protect it and say it’s not a pyramid scheme. But truth of the matter is the people the made most gains on btc are the ones that came in early. The gains get less the newer you are to btc

Hahaha that’s funny. I would agree with that if bitcoin never dips and is a straight line moving up in regards to price. But the fact that it dips (corrects) every time it goes up shows you that people are cashing out (making money off of the new comers) hence causing a loss for others

I just made an account on QuadrigaCX. I have to wait 3 business days for the verification process to complete. Fingers crossed it doesn’t reach 30k by then

Anytime my friend. I do agree with everything you said, but I still hate myself for not buying in early �� but this is life, and what goes up must come down. And there will be more opportunities like this to come. I am looking into iota now since I do see the long term potential of it over any crypto

So looking at that 16-17k price and thinking you can still make gains on that. Is that even logical?
