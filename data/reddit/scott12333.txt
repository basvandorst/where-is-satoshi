Ohhh ok I gotcha. I didn’t know that. That’s still a bummer since I don’t want to keep my coins on an exchange. Do you think there’ll be improvement before lightning?

I don’t have any confirmations. I’m using breadwallet and in progress:40% seems to be where a lot of people are stuck at

Are you saying lightning won’t help moving crypto to the exchanges then?
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:46:10
Is the lightning network something bit coin itself will implement? Or is this something that you can buy into?

Lol. It’s very frustrating and making it hard to do some serious investing. I am going to keep at it until I get it because I feel like we are still in the early stages and have lots of room for growth, but something definitely needs to change if any type of crypto currency is going to become mainstream

Yeah, I'm not looking to do a ton of trading or anything, and my goal is to invest and sit on it, but I want to do a few trades and whatnot to make sure I have the wallet/trading/conversions/fees and everything figured out and I know how to do it right and securely.

Thank you. Will give this a watch

Ok I gotcha. I’d like to invest in all coins, which is why I’m kind of bummed that the network is so slow. But I’d like to know as much about the stuff as possible whether I just buy and hold or end up getting other coins

I understand that. I know the whole network didn’t come to a complete halt with zero activity. But checking every single sub for every wallet, exchange and crypto, all I see are transactions being in limbo, including mine.
I guess I should have worded my question as “Will the majority of people trading and investing in crypto be able to reliably and relatively quickly do so before lightning?”
E: a word

Just from my research and personal experience waiting on the last few days for my bitcoin to go from my wallet to an exchange, as well as everyone on different subs having problems
I got my btc from a nearby atm, had it on a paper wallet and have been waiting for it to be sent to the exchange, but my transaction has been sitting at 40% (according to my wallet) for about 36 hours

Ok thank you
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:45:06
Thank you
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:21:30
If you don’t mind me asking, what type of wallet and which exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:09:17
Gotcha. Didn’t think about it in that light
