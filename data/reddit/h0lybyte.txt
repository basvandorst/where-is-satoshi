YOU ARE A GENIUS

Don't they also operate bitcoinsaresexy? I think they do.

The only thing I hate is that Coinkite uses cloudflare :/
I dont trust cloudflare as much as I should haha
@_date: 2014-12-07 07:08:19
Yeah but then you have to maintain the node and also maintain the security! Be sure to set it up so that once you receive funds, they are automatically sent to your cold storage ;)
@_date: 2014-11-27 08:11:03
be sure to use a proper *offline* generator too 
@_date: 2014-10-04 19:29:15
If you follow the guide, it takes about 15mins and I promise you that you will be impressed afterwards! It "streamlines" the whole process, to a degree and makes it extremely user friendly.

I am working on something similar :)
Satoshize (Color coin reward system, that can allow the users to receive dogecoin, bitcoin, ect..). 
@_date: 2014-11-21 17:15:31
I was thinking of doing a similar concept, maybe we could talk and expand. One thing I would suggest is to use your own color coin and then have an option to transfer to bitcoin, dogecoin ect... or let the user buy cool insite stuff with the color coin.

Such sexy, many wows :)

" plausible deniability to users who contribute disk space." .. see when we download a file for a user and then offer it to them, (as long as we dont alter that said file), we are covered by the DMCA [as long as we comply with the the copyright holders issue for a removal]. However, with seeding, you are actively hosting a file , thus actively distributing the content. In addition, plausible deniability can only go so far... it just won't hold when you are hit with multiple issues. 
I will still look into what you suggest, because I have not spent enough time to research into the specifics. 
Edit: some formatting, but I have to finish coding, so dont mind the crap
(I am not trying to bash your suggestion, just stating what I know)

I am actually working on something like this with Deathwing from BTCTalk, if anyone has interests or more information, let me know :)
Currently, we offer 1000mb data for &lt;0.05USD (download) BUT have not expanded to the seeding area (upload). Mainly for legal reasons:
Example - if it was automated, what if someone abused the system and had childporn as the content they wanted seeded?
If anyone wants to throw up some concepts to work out / help out, then that be great :S

No censorship! The idea of censorship defeats a pillar in the fundamental foundation of crypto-currency. Let people make use of the ability to downvote and not get too carried away in drama.

Right? Only if 161,691 readers and 604 users here now could help us figure out this cryptic puzzle.

--- Not disagreeing with you or anything, just figured I would also throw my thoughts around.
I wouldnt say stop, if anything, it defuses a lot of social issues [lower level gang violence, street corner/turf fights] but also creates a whole new subculture [easier to get LSD or easier to scam kids with nbombs]. Just like how Amazon makes it easier to get deals, it also gave people a reference point for prices. Regardless, its just way too late for me to comment any further :P

You can have multiple "centralized" models that all encompass a grand decentralized structure. Remember that there are citizens out there that can not understand the difference and/or want simplicity rather than security/freedom ect...

hey, thats how he got famous... by being a human test subject.... I wonder if he would be willing to get cancer... then have a show on how he plans to beat it.

No need, I was referring to as a catch phrase ;P

Not too sure if you actually tried soylet but its definitely not fun living off of it. The Soylet farts, Oh dear god. 
Edit: Remember there is a difference in "living" and "surviving", one compasses the bare necessities of life and the other is a wide range of emotions; Living is more than just a fiscal responsibility.

I hate being this guy but... you can just use snapcard.
They have Amazon and NewEgg support and they use coinbase charts, (i believe). 
Edit: Also be sure to get a nice GPU, then imagine  your next rig as a superbadass mining machine, then mine a bunch of altcoins, then trade them for mBTC, then you could use your btc to register a company , then use everything else you buy as a tax write off, then with the profit start your own solar powered mining farm, then buy a trip to the MOOONNNNNNNNN with your profit, then start a new solar powered mining farm on the moon, then write your moon trip off as a business expense because you started a Japanese solar powered mining farm, and then ... and then.... and then... and then.... and then..and then... after you find your car, you can buy North Korea, thus world domination.

Edit Reason: I forgot to select a champ on LoL, so for the next 5mins, I am going to put more bullshit into this comment, until I re-queue, why? Because its the Internet and fuck your karma points.

Black Market Reloaded? &amp;&amp; Sheep Market? 
There are other things besides drugs, (i.e sex, guns, scripts, databases, ect..) that account for a decent stake of the transactions. 
Hosting and gambling are two other big ones.
@_date: 2013-10-04 00:06:31
There are other forums out there to take its place. Ones that are better, smarter, faster ect..
