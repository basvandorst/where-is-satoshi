Of course POW change would be difficult. I didn't say the opposite. I just said that a GPU-mined chain can be as secure as an ASIC mined-chain, if the coin is so valuable that most of the world's GPUs are used to mine it. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:50:35
Ethereum almost reached parity while being mined by GPUs. And those who didn't buy into ETH did so for other reasons.

The whitepaper does not say anything about forking the protocol. It's about agreeing on the longest chain within one and the same protocol.

Very few people that participated in these polls. Not representative. Roger Ver accounts for like 99% of the participating bitcoins with his large stake.
Knowling posting such a flawed poll returns the s*** to you instantaneously.
Reminds me of that DAO-poll.

If both sides just sit and wait, Sha256 ASICs as well as all bitcoins would be dead capital. Users and exchanges can then agree to change the mining algo, to revive their dead capital without reviving the dead capital of Sha256 miners. What could miners do to revive their dead capital without reviving the dead capital of the assumed enemy, the owners of bitcoin? I guess nothing.

I think that exchanges will not adopt S2X and that will allow miners to save face unfortunately. I would prefer a showdown with a clear winner: Exchanges adopting S2X, price crashing, PoW fork announced, price recovering, PoW fork happening, miner mass suicide, more network effect as GPU mining will be more decentralized temporarily.
@_date: 2017-09-29 22:29:07
Honest miners could switch off their miners 2 weeks in advance to reduce the difficulty beforehand - or, they could in the meantime use their Asics to launch a 51% attack on BCH - would be fun. Punish all the exchanges that trade BCH.

Economic activity of behalf of their customers. And it seems to me that many NYA supporters have already sold big portions of their bitcoins for Ether, Dash, BCH and other cool stuff that can scale as hell. So they have less economic weight.
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:49:24
No. Smart investors will wait until the devs and the community come together to change the mining algo.
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:59:25
Almost, yes. Otherwise their share of the total hashrate would be less stable, and Jihan would stay out of politics to not cause anger among his customers. Basically, there is a multitude of indicators that most of the big "pools" are fake, but you are free to believe what you want.
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:25:32
All this "representation and majority decision making" is just about the order of transactions. You need to read the whole whitepaper. The whitepaper does not even specify that the Proof-of-work needs to be Sha256, it just mentions Sha256 as an example.
@_date: 2017-10-28 15:08:54
If they prop up the price of BCH high enough, I will scratch up the private keys of my two physical Denarium 1 BTC to dump the BCH - although this would ruin the collector's value. Have sold all my regular BCH.
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:27:42
Maybe some "honest miners" are just pretending to be dishonest miners.
@_date: 2017-10-28 18:01:20
I generally agree, but there are too exceptions: 
1.  51% attack or chain of empty blocks
2. No block for an extended period of time.
In the second case we must assume that nobody with a meaningful investment is interested in mining on the chain any longer, so nobody's business is hurt by a PoW change. 
By the way, I think changing the PoW is a less meaningful change than changing the blocksize limit, so if the orginal chain stops, a chain with new PoW can still be called Bitcoin. Even the whitepaper mentions Sha256 just as an example-algorithm.

continue to ignore all the FUD from those who do not appreciate decentralization.
@_date: 2017-09-29 22:07:51
The whitepaper is about transaction ordering, it does not say anything about changing the protocol. Segwit2x can never be the longest chain, because it is an invalid chain.
@_date: 2017-09-29 22:25:58
Not necessarily. If the hashing algo gets forked from the same block as Segwit2x, then Bitcoin forks into two new coins right at the same time and it will be impossible to tell which one is Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-20 07:44:42
According the Sergio Demian Lerner, one of the two inventors of Asicboost, Covert Asicboost (CA) is also possible with Segwit, but less effective: 
While CA via changing the order of transactions would no longer be possible with Segwit, he writes that it could still be done by changing the content of transactions. The transactions in those blocks from Antpool look indeed manufactured.
Also, disregarding Segwit, big blocks give miners using CA a competitive advantage: Since using CA means having few transactions in blocks, a miner using CA misses out on a lot of transactions fees when blocks are full and fees are high, reducing the competitive advantage of using CA.
@_date: 2017-10-27 06:58:09
I totally agree. Even if they don't attack the chain, it would be great if the community would just sustain with 1/3rd of the hash rate and wait 6 weeks for the difficulty to drop, while Antpool, Btc.top, btc.com and viatbc would mine on a worthless chain, securing them a place in the top ten of greatest fools of Bitcoin history books.

Funny how these statements always lack the so called confidential interval. They are never specific. What if F2Pool gets a lucky strike and mines the first block after the fork? Will all BT2 then become worthless immediately, because Bitcoin Core is the chain with more Proof-of-work at that moment, and Jihan will be too late to mine thousands of blocks on Segwit2x? I could argue that BT2 already had lost and he was too late to catch up. And what if Segwit2x is 1000 blocks ahead? I could argue it's all just a very very very unlikely case of variance and Bitcoin Core has in fact more hashpower, they were just very very very unlucky. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 12:23:50
10-20 bitcoins in transaction fees wasted by the attacker. Probably they will also pump BCH during and after the Big-Blocker conference, which will be in a few days. Could go as high as 0.3, if it's well orchestrated. We will see.
I have my last BCH ready to dump them hopefully right on top of the coming pump. Then they can play hot potato game with those BCH, because I will never buy them back.
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:35:11
Then why would it make sense for pool owners to sign the NYA? If these pools compete for miners, why don't they offer different voting options like Slush offers it? Those thousands of miners could mine on Slush pool tomorrow if they existed. Looks more like they just pretend to be pools, except for Slush, which is the only true pool.

It seems that Antpool is still using Covert Asicboost.

Users of breadwallet can lose all of their funds, because there is no guarantee that the longer chain will win, since the longer chain cannot wipe out the shorter chain. It's entirely possible that the majority of non-breadwallet users follow the shorter chain and don't mind to wait several months until the difficulty drops. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 17:59:12
Sure. I have been considering the same, but to me it seems highly likely that there is something to the AB issue, because of the fishy behaviour of Bitmain with regards to a lot of issues. And I want Segwit regardless, that's why I support UASF until somebody comes up with a valid argument against it, not just some vague stuff like "technical debt".
@_date: 2017-05-23 13:15:08
Sorry, it was not my intention to urge Greg Maxwell into anything. I was just wondering if there were any news about this issue that I had missed.
Unfortunately my impression is that most Bitcoiners don't realize what's going on in Bitcoin with Bitmain crippling the whole ecosystem bit by bit for their own profit. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:55:51
Let me put it simple: I have had enough of politicans deciding what is best for me. I didn't come to Bitcoin so that miners would decide what is best for me. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 20:32:42
If hash power is law, then Ethereum can't switch to Proof-of-stake. That's probably why ViaBTC is not worried about Bitcoin losing its No spot. Ripple is still too far behind.
@_date: 2017-05-17 14:11:55
I don't know, and the patent-stuff is just distraction. The real question is whether Covert ASICBoost is the reason that Bitmain rejects Segwit, or not. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 10:27:21
So what? Let them FUD. Debunking the faulty players is the first step in finding a solution.
@_date: 2017-05-23 08:12:51
That is a very naive view. An alleged extra $100 million could go a long way in bribing other members of the ecosystem, and to uncover that, you need to put things right on the table.
A BIP designed to do nothing else than to stop Covert ASICBoost would force every miner to put his cards on the table. This will make it visible for everyone. Especially in a situation where it is possible that some voices in the community are just bribed voices, it is highly necessary to make the things visible for everyone.
As it is now, any miner can hide the fact he opposes Segwit because it hinders Covert ASICBoost by declaring to not signal for Segwit for other reasons. We have to untangle the two issues.
@_date: 2017-05-17 10:41:57
The patents are for overt Asicboost, not covert Asicboost. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:52:41
That's because people like zitronix and me have been quiet bitcoin users for years, who woke up because of the unexpected blocking of Segwit and the Covert AsicBoost news. Me, for example, I have been involved with Peercoin for several years, because Peercoin is all about decentralization. Now I am coming back to Bitcoin to help to preserve what is left of the decentralization. I spend much of my free time for it, it's not easy with a family and a job.
We need as many people as possible to support the UASF for it to be a success. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 08:07:06
Ho Ho, now we are all very scared of the miners. Oh, how mighty they are! 
@_date: 2017-05-09 11:18:45
Can we sticky this?
@_date: 2017-05-31 08:45:00
Let's compromse. Pushing for UASF while Jeff Garzik is trying to convince core devs to follow the New York consensus is not a very wise thing, after two years of scaling war. New York Consensus will enable Second layer and disable AsicBoost. Good times ahead for Bitcoin if we all support this.
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:12:04
I have been following him on twitter for a while, but a few days ago I unfollowed him, because he is just saying FUD every time. He is afraid of UASF, that's why he activated Segwit in Litecoin.
He should at least write someting like an open letter to the community to state his vision for Bitcoin, it could earn him some respect.
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:16:50
Time frame does not match. Smart Money, Institutional investors and public can not all be within just a few weeks.
@_date: 2017-05-17 10:33:01
Yes, the silence around this issue is ear-battering. I would think there are discussions going on behind the szenes.

thanks! I remembered it was up here a while ago, but wanted to bring this issue up again.
@_date: 2017-05-17 10:48:24
Regardless, it would be good if everybody had to put their cards on the table. If the blocking of Segwit is done for respectable reasons and not because of the use of Covert AsicBoost, it would be easier to find a compromise. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 11:05:01
This is actually good news. Shows that they have a plan to bring Bitcoin forward, but I doubt that they will have reliable code ready in time. 
Barry Silbert has good intentions for Bitcoin. Just worried because he needs to drag quite a bunch of bad actors along within his agreement. And it was not a good idea to exclude all core developers. This will almost guarantee for a buggy code.
@_date: 2017-05-06 18:31:52
Funny also that BU-shills always refer to the "electronic cash" part in the title of the whitpaper, saying that it's cash and not gold and thus needs to scale on-chain. But they neglegt the first part of the whitepaper title which is "Peer-2-Peer", that means it needs to be decentraliced, everybody should be able to be a peer. BU would be the road towards more centralization. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:48:16
Yes, it's a bubble popping, but this was a mini-bubble, and it will probably go down only about 50% from the top, maybe 70% for a few days in a V-bottom. Overall market cap of crypto was only 5.5 times higher than in the top in 2013. That's not so much after 3.5 years in an emerging technology. I think we will see the next bubble right when the bitcoin scaling has been solved via any of MASF, UASF, compromisem, or PoW fork. Could be within only 6-12 months from now.
@_date: 2017-05-29 09:52:36
I would also favor a compromise over UASF. I like especially the flagday part of this new proposal. Now that most big players in the industry have signed the New York Consensus, this will ensure that everybody will stick to their words, specially the Asicboosters.
@_date: 2017-05-17 10:24:57
Of course it is urgent. If we wait, Bitfury will either build chips that use Covert AsicBoost likewise or they will go bunkrupt. Once everyone is using Covert AsicBoost, the only option to ever make protocol changes that affect the block header would be a change of mining algo.
@_date: 2017-05-26 08:39:15
Thanks, I am already, holding Peercoin and Decred :-)
But Bitcoin still has the network effect. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 17:20:39
Not as long as half of the mining power is held by the Bitmain-cartel. Satoshi did not foresee how centralized mining would be. I will be ok to run a SPV node once we have so many miners that they can not  make an agreement more easily than users.
@_date: 2017-05-23 11:17:16


Yeah, even Bitmain thinks that UASF could be succesful. That's why they activated Segwit in Litecoin, because it became clear that Coblee had enough community support for a UASF. Initially, they blocked it to hinder Litecoin from becoming a Demo of a future Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-05 07:13:47
This is great news. If we disable Covert ASIC-Boost, it will bring the blocksize debate back to an even playing field. Jihan Wu has never looked like a bad guy to me, just somebody who maximizes his profit as much as feasible.
I think he has overestimated the support of Bitcoin Unlimited in the community, and now starts to understand that he needs to compromise for Bitcoin to remain the No.1 coin. He has already sticked to his word to activate Segwit on Litecoin.
