No offense, but I don't see how anyone could see it any other way.  It's a currency that everyone seems to want to hoard rather than spend, or trade for USD/Euros etc. rather than spend.  That, right there, sets off huge warnings signs for me.  Also, I never could bring myself to purchase a Bitcoin even if I wanted to because all of the sites for doing so seemed very shady and untrustworthy.  Of course this is only personal opinion, but it does tie into their shit infrastructure.  From my perspective, you have massive balls for even trusting one of these sites with 10,000 actual dollars.

If college is a scam then what the fuck is bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:51:00
lol, Bitcoins have no intrinsic value, nor are they backed by anyone or anything...the price is what idiots are willing to pay, and the economics of it are probably more complicated than just "the exchanges and big boys are in cahoots".
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:12:34
Yeah, not a Pump and Dump or anything. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:35:03
This is the best answer you're gonna get, even if most won't admit it.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:19:09
What's changed?  
The number of shit spam posts by young accounts saying moronic crap like "sit back and enjoy the ride" has increased
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:40:05
Thanks, I was wondering where I put my chart of rainbow colors  meant to signify potential prices from 20 to 220.
Edit:  This doesn't make as much sense now that the text is posted, but I'm leaving it

Well fuck me gently!  I was on the fence about buying some Bitcoin but now that I see this awesome merchant is supporting Bitcoins I am going to buy 1000 BTC!  I can't wait to spend my Bitcoin on this merchant's mystery goods.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:10:06
WAIT GUYS, I FIGURED IT OUT!  Over at you can see one of the top headlines is "North Korea declares its target: Japan".  Is Best Korea going after Mt.Gox?!?!

I lost a couple hours of my life being entertained by this sub.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:42:21
Yeah, because not long ago a Bitcoin was worth 230+ USD, and now it's worth less than 100 USD.  Sounds like I want to use that to buy stuff.  It'd be like adding an Expert difficulty to Steam sales:  "Can I buy while my virtual currency is actually worth a damn???"
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:43:52
Let's pretend Steam does take Bitcoin, and I also have 1 Bitcoin.  Right now 1 Bitcoin is worth ~100 USD, so I go to Steam and use my 1 Bitcoin, worth 100 USD, to buy 2 games.  24 hours later 1 Bitcoin changes in value, to 200 USD.  Bitpay would do nothing.  No one would.  If I had waited 24 hours I could have purchased 4 games instead of 2, but too bad for me.
Edit:  Also, saying Valve only wants the 19.99 USD and nothing else matters shows that Steam accepting Bitcoins just adds a useless step to the process.  Steam could potentially accept Reddit karma if Karmapay existed instead of Bitpay.  They don't give a fuck, as long as they get the dollars...as you said.

PMing you my credit card and social security number right now. I look forward to working with you.

You originally said:


You say the exchange rate doesn't matter.  My point this whole time is that the exchange rate matters a lot.  And the amount the exchange rate changes also matters a lot.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:10:59


Not sure if troll or just incredibly dense...
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:24:16
How could you know either way?  Just because they said?  The first "press release" didn't say anything about DDos, but they likely realized blaming a DDos attack rather than their "success" is better to save face.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:30:40


lol wut?  BTC is supposed to be a currency you clown
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:37:06


Don't treat it as a commodity, but rather a currency....but also don't value that currency by its purchasing power.
God damn this sub is just full of brilliance!
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:59:29
How are you going the pick the correct answer from these comments?  The one with the most upvotes?  The one that sounds the smartest?  The one that aligns most with what you want to hear?
Marty McFly is the only one who knows what will happen to the price of Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:11:37
And this is why it's terrible as currency.

Just because they say something doesn't make it true...
@_date: 2013-04-13 16:56:35
It's like this sub is full of people too stupid to insult.  Bitpay only guarantees the exchange rate for 15 minutes, that pretty much says it all.  But in case it doesn't....
If I have a Bitcoin today worth 100 USD and I use it to buy something today, but then tomorrow the price of a Bitcoin goes up to 200 USD then I got screwed.  I could have gotten double, but I didn't, and no service like Bitpay or anything is gonna remedy that.  Likewise, if I am selling something for 100 USD and I accept a Bitcoin but tomorrow the price goes down, I again get fucked.  I don't give a flying fuck if Bitpay has a 15 minute exchange window, it's not enough and it proves how shit of a currency Bitcoin is.
Nevermind the fact that Bitpay looks shady as fuck too, all their example videos on Youtube have been removed and it says the account is closed, and they also had a blog that seems to be closed.

This stuff is too confusing. Can I just send you my credit card number and you buy the Bitcoins for me?
@_date: 2013-04-14 00:24:31
I knew adding the "Edit" in would be too much for your dumbass, as you skipped past the main point.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:21:53
This sub is like watching a train wreck happen in slow motion. Between the people who act like Bitcoins are their new religion (Hold, Spartans!) and the idiots looking to get rich quick using shady exchanges there is always entertainment here.

Best comment in this whole subreddit
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:49:25
But USD gains could have provided you with even more coins, which you do have an interest in.  This isn't exactly rocket science and I really don't understand your point.

You're more than paranoid, you're so delusional that you can't even imagine this statement being correct.

I have no idea if you're trolling or not.  Though I have seen a few post similar to yours but they oddly seem to get "swept under the rug."

LOL, I thought this shit was a scam before, but this terrible AMA really cements it.  What a joke!

The best part is that you have no way of knowing if you got hacked or if places like Bitfloor are a scam. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:36:40
If you had 1 coin last week and did nothing with it throughout the week then you lost unrealized gains.  You could have more coins, or more USD, or both.  
If you did do something with your 1 coin, and now ended up back with 1 coin then you just like to sound stupid.
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:09:47
Can't deny that what you're saying isn't within the realm of possibility.  Especially considering that the exchanges can go down and come back up without warning, and they can easily just say "DDoS" and that's it.  I do not trade Bitcoins, so it seems crazy to me that people have enough confidence in these exchanges to do business with them.
