its a grant program not a giveaway.

but someone else is holding the coins hence why I kept the federation style part...
but alright I'll let the federation part good since I guess it not the "proper" term since it more so refers to the consensus algo.
But it is still central figures holding funds albeit a more decentralized manner so it be much safer somewhat to build on it and I say go for it. And maybe one day the design will be way more trustless allowing it be 98% as safe as just holding it via private keys on your own on mainnet.
Pretty excited to see the dev of it.....
PS: according to Echo's site:
\&gt; By introducing a dynamic, pseudonymous, open **federation**, Echo improves on the trust-minimization of existing sidechain architectures  [
So it looks like it indeed is a type of Federation but it more than that?

um even if the mainnet is audited the peg will still be in a federation style albeit a safer than regular custodial solutions so it still interesting to see how it goes.
