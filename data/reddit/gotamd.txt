That doesn't necessarily matter since Bitcoin can be exchanged for Yuan or USD.  Therefore, an imbalance between the exchange rates of BTC, Yuan, and USD should be corrected by [arbitrageurs](

I have the same concerns after reading the Lightning Network design docs.  Can anyone from Blockstream give their opinion on these concerns?
@_date: 2015-12-24 19:00:41
The hubs that inevitably develop will probably charge fees of their own without having to invest in all the computing horsepower and electricity that miners do.  The groups that will naturally be able to create the most-used hubs will be those that have the most bitcoin already.  I would imagine that Blockstream and their employees control quite a lot of Bitcoin currently.

It's a perfectly good environment for doing testing like this.  There's no "need" for transactions there unless you make one, such as to perform a test...like this.  By your logic, you should never have testing environments for software projects because there's no "need" for anything to be going on in them.

I don't think Bitcoin itself will ever become a State-sponsored currency.
@_date: 2015-06-20 11:53:41
If you want to run a "test", use the testnet.  This is an attack, plain and simple.  Some people may think that the ends justify the means, but we should at least call this what it is: a DoS attack on Bitcoin.

I would run a full node if I could do so without committing to add storage space to it indefinitely.  It would be great to be able to store, say, 10GB of the blockchain and leave it at that.  I'd also love to see pruning of transactions where all the outputs have been spent.  That would decrease the storage requirements for nodes dramatically.
@_date: 2015-12-24 14:08:37
The same could be said for implementations of a higher blocksize limit.  As I understand it, the primary argument against doing so is that it is impossible for the network to sustain.  There are others who disagree and would like to try, but their implementations have been banned from discussion here.
@_date: 2015-12-25 10:30:40
Even if many pools limit their block size, there are many that don't, and they still mine blocks. The regularly occurring larger blocks (if needed) would help clear transaction backlogs and increase overall throughout of the network.
@_date: 2015-06-21 20:50:28
One alternative theory of the value of Bitcoin is that its value is based on its usefulness in performing transactions, storing value, and speculation, and very little of its value is determined by the cost of mining.  In this scenario, miners are price takers, not price makers.  If that is true, approximately half of the miners will simply shut down when the block reward halves assuming all else is equal.
Chew on it for a bit.
@_date: 2015-06-04 14:56:42
Can anyone tell me how the other devices that participate in a multisig wallet get notified of pending transactions?  This sounds like a killer app to make conducting in-person Bitcoin transactions safer (ie, you can't be mugged or have your device stolen and lose all the Bitcoin in that wallet).
@_date: 2014-12-03 14:58:50
This all sounds great, but coinffeine relies heavily on "a payment processor the supports non-reversible payments".  Does such a thing exist outside cryptocurrencies?  It certainly isn't Paypal or any of the other regularly-used personal payment processing services.

I believe $800/hour is on the high end of the scale for experienced associates at the very top large firms in the US.  I'd say he's likely overpaying or somehow got himself represented by a very prestigious firm (I'm at work, so haven't watched the video and don't know who's representing him).
@_date: 2014-03-03 22:53:49
I think he's talking about its immediate future.  Otherwise, there's no point in saying it.  I think 5 years is a long enough time horizon to judge whether or not Bitcoin's future is currently "in doubt".
Anyway, if Shiller and I knew each other, I would challenge him to a bet about the value of Bitcoin in 5 years.  If the value of Bitcoin drops below $600 any time during the period between 4 and 5 years from now, Shiller wins.  If the value of a single Bitcoin stays above $600 for the entire period, then I win.
And yeah, the last statement is utterly ridiculous.  Bitcoin solves a very "sensible problem": how to move money around the world at (near-)zero cost.

Indeed it is.  I am not a daytrader, but I do own stocks.  Figuring out capital gains is what I dread the most about filing my taxes.  Thankfully all US stock brokers (that I know of) automatically track gains and losses (ie, basis) for you on stocks bought in 2012 and later (I think it's 2012) so it is going to be less of a problem in the future.
AFAIK, there is no Bitcoin exchange that currently tracks your basis and gains/losses from each trade in an easily reportable way.

I don't know what that sentence is trying to say, but Coinbase is not an exchange because the prices you pay or sell Bitcoin there are set by Coinbase, not other buy and sell orders.  The counterparty in your transaction is Coinbase, not other Bitcoin or USD holders like on an exchange.

They did nobody a favor.  They implemented stupid customer service procedures where they'd automatically retry BTC withdrawals without verifying whether or not the first/earlier withdrawal(s) actually processed with a different transaction ID.  This may have caused them to become insolvent (time will tell), and it caused someone or multiple someones to decide to DoS the Bitcoin network and target other exchanges hoping to exploit the same potential stupid policy that Mt.Gox had.

There has to be some demand to hold currency in order for it to have any value at all.  You can't engage in transactions denominated in something which has no value when held.  Otherwise, you've just made a PayPal competitor and not created a real currency.

So, consumer savings held in banks have doubled.  They didn't mention that the reserves held by banks have, I believe, much more than doubled.  Why is the Fed not blaming itself for paying interest on excess reserves and encouraging the *banks* to hoard money?  That's what I'd like to know.

I seriously think that Blockchain.info should remove the automated email and cloud-based wallet backups that they offer.  They are responsible for the vast majority of hacks I've seen.  Those features should *at least* come with huge disclaimers about security.
@_date: 2014-01-31 22:06:20
I haven't used Blockchain.info in a while, but I think I remember having the ability to send unencrypted wallets.  Either way, many people choose passwords that are not incredibly secure, especially when they think 2FA is protecting them.

Yes, it depends on what tax bracket you're in.  For most people in the US, that rate is ~25%.  It's not quite 39.6% (the bracket for people making over $400,000/year), but it's still extremely high.

That should be 2,41**4**,392.  It's very interesting, nonetheless, because it would indicate that there are far fewer than 2.5 million users of Bitcoin.  Considering that there are ~1.3 billion people in OECD countries alone, it's clear that Bitcoin's penetration remains extremely low.
@_date: 2014-03-27 11:48:15


And that's only if they keep (or kept) those records.  For a lot of people who don't have meticulous record-keeping, this will mean all their Bitcoin transactions will have an implicit 15% (or more) tax on the entire transaction.  I guess it could be worse, but that's pretty bad.
@_date: 2014-06-30 21:08:09
That makes sense given the recent rise in price on the public exchanges.  The people bidding were willing to pay even above the current market price because if they tried to purchase the volume in question in public, it would drive the price up much higher.  It's definitely good evidence that the market is not being manipulated upward (assuming that's true) ;)

The fact that they lied about the reason for the missing coins makes me think that however they were lost, it was probably through some illegal activity on the part of Karpeles and potentially others involved with Mt.Gox.  They had to have known that the explanation they gave was completely false.  The only reason I can think of to give that reason/excuse anyway is that the truth would/will put them in prison.

They could also have had an unencrypted backup of their private key either stored on the cloud/in email somewhere.  Many people have been hacked that way.
@_date: 2014-06-30 21:09:34
They paid above market price because purchasing that many Bitcoins on the public market would have driven the price up dramatically anyway.  The public market is now reacting to that knowledge.

Are you just trolling now?  You haven't explained why you think it's ridiculous for me to say that the house looks like it may be uninhabitable.  The latitude is important because it gets *cold*.  If you want to live in a house with no walls in a warm area, it won't cause you any problems as far as the temperature is concerned.  However, move that same house to a place that freezes, and it's problematic.

I agree with most of what you've said, but I remain optimistic.  Yes, Bitcoin is still evolving, but the problems it has now are mostly due to the fact that it is a fledgling currency that is being built from the ground up without the support of any government.  It's the first of its kind, and I think the fact that it's still around after 5 years is evidence that it satisfies some people's unmet needs.  The future may not be Bitcoin, but it could be.

Yeah, once you have Blockchain.info send you wallet backups via email, those backups are no more secure than email itself (ie, not secure at all).

If it was tx malleability, then we should also see transactions of equal value going to the same address about a week (or whatever) apart.  I'm extremely skeptical that anyone could empty Mt.Gox of 800k bitcoins within any reasonable amount of time.  Attackers would have had to constantly cycled Bitcoin in and out (twice) of Mt.Gox to do this.  It would have taken a massive amount of time, or "only" a couple months if they started out with a pretty large number of legit coins in their account(s) and Mt.Gox was completely and utterly incompetent in a way that defies belief.
The fact that so many Mt.Gox withdrawals had been failing toward the end is evidence to me that the attacker probably would have been affected by that problem as well and many of their transactions would have legitimately failed as the attack went on.  I can hardly believe Mt.Gox could have allowed this to happen and failed to notice what was going on until being completely wiped out.
@_date: 2014-03-19 18:37:40
As far as how to protect yourself, there are people who like to keep their private keys in an offline computer and use it to manually sign transactions.  That's probably the ultimate security (though be sure to back up elsewhere offline in case of crashes).  It's also makes your Bitcoin extremely hard to use, but if you want to do that, I believe Armory supports it.
Paper wallets are another method, though they require you to spend the entire balance of the wallet at once (so, send it all to another wallet you control, and then spend a partial balance from there).  They are also (obviously) much harder to use than traditional wallets.
I personally just try to not get malware on my computers.  Losing all my Bitcoin would not change my life.

It's much smoother than Android and I didn't have to root it and/or install a 3rd party ROM to get the preinstalled crapware off of it.  The app selection and quality is definitely sub par, but it's getting better.  They also desperately need a notification center and faster access to enable/disable radios without using 3rd party apps, but that should supposedly be here soon.  Android has a superior keyboard, though...and I don't think that will change any time soon.

I'm really sick of the "this is actually good news" statements like this article.  If the IRS had ruled that Bitcoin is taxed like foreign currency, that would **not** exclude the use cited in this article.  However, the current tax treatment effectively cuts off a huge potential market for Bitcoin.  The tax bookkeeping burden for using Bitcoin in everyday transactions is now so high that nobody will do it.  That means people will either ignore the tax law (at their own peril) or they will obey it and stop using Bitcoin for normal transactions.  I don't see that as good news.

If there was malware, it could have intercepted a 2FA code and made it appear that your login simply failed for some reason, meanwhile logging in itself using the 2FA the user just put in.  It's certainly not as easy as a simple keylogger grabbing a password, but it's possible that something like that happened.  I still think the more likely answer is an unencrypted backup left somewhere where it was accessible (or lifted from an infected machine).
Also keep in mind that backups may be encrypted, but they *do not require 2FA to restore*.  So, even an encrypted backup becomes vulnerable if stored on a compromised machine where you also put in your encryption password (such as when logging into Blockchain.info).

The whole article is about how the expected returns on mining for any given pool, or even solo, are the same and that variance is all that changes.  Variance obviously can lead to more or fewer Bitcoin and a risk-loving individual should actually go for smaller pools or even solo mine.  I personally found 4 blocks during a period when mining as a pool meant that my reward was roughly only 25 bitcoins.  I would have been much better off mining solo (all else being equal), but I didn't want to take on that risk and just as easily could have found zero blocks.  I was an extreme outlier in my luck.  Anyway, the whole discussion of the fluctuating price of bitcoin itself is pretty much irrelevant here and shouldn't have been included because it only clouds the issue.
As far as pool size and variance goes, see comment.  Most of the pools out there are actually incredibly small and therefore *do* lead to significant variance over a short timespan (which is pretty much the life of ASICs since difficulty has been rocketing up with process improvements).  Once mining difficulty levels off, this won't be an issue because hardware won't become obsolete so quickly.

The bottom line is that if you don't have sole control of the private keys to your Bitcoins, they *aren't yours*.  Nobody needs a "Bitcoin Bank".  That lack of need for a bank is the entire point behind Bitcoin in the first place.

The US government doesn't care.  That's capital gains and it's your problem.  That's one of the hidden taxes that inflation causes.  It does the same thing by forcing people into higher tax brackets even though their salary may just have been keeping pace with inflation.

Yeah, if I had $5 million in the bank I would immediately retire.  I wouldn't live an extravagant lifestyle, but I'd be plenty comfortable.  $2,000/month on housing, $1,000/month on food, and another $1,000/month on other incidentals means I burn only a bit over $3.8 million over 80 years.  That's a solid (and secure) middle-class lifestyle for your entire life without working a day or relying on your return on savings to outpace inflation.
Also, when I say I'd retire, I would probably still "work" in some capacity.  However, I would do so on my own terms and not to be making money.
@_date: 2014-03-27 17:01:45
I have to agree.  It's an interesting read, but I think he is missing a key point which is that the Dogecoin community is almost entirely made up of members of the Bitcoin community.  There is a *lot* of overlap.  His comments on ill-informed libertarians in the Bitcoin community are pretty insulting as well.
What I found most odd about his comments were that he says DOGE is going to succeed as a currency because it is stupid (which will drive adoption, which will drive value in turn).  That's just not the case.  DOGE adoption, surprise surprise, looks very similar to Bitcoin adoption.  Also, DOGE's 5.2 billion/year increase in supply will relegate it to the "funny money" category indefinitely.  Adoption is not anywhere near high enough to keep pace with the growth in supply, and I don't see an inflationary cryptocurrency surviving.  Why would you ever hold it?  This is already evidenced by the long-term DOGE market cap charts.  It's been trending down even as supply is exploding.  Under circumstances like that, nobody will take it seriously, and while being stupid may be good for adoption, being a currency that nobody takes seriously will kill adoption regardless of other factors.

This is part of educating one's self.  I'm putting the information out there so people are aware.

I also never said that the 2FA was hacked.  I said that people's email and/or Dropbox was hacked and therefore their accounts (private keys) on Blockchain.info were hacked.  Never did I say the 2FA was hacked, just that it won't protect you if you're compromised through email or Dropbox.

If you want to withdraw money from your bank, you can do so.  It may take some more time, but it will happen (unless the gov't freezes your account, which they don't do for people subjected to ransom AFAIK).  I don't think it's a "million times" more difficult.  With Bitcoin, you have to worry about how to convert it to dollars or something else anonymously.  With cash or gold, as soon as it's left the bank, it's nearly untraceable.

I'd love to hear an insider's perspective on BFL, but I'm primarily interested in knowing if they were letting devices leave through the back door to preferred customers while other people waited, and whether or not they were mining for themselves while delaying customer hardware.
@_date: 2014-03-17 14:56:25
That's basically been what's happened with all the ASIC manufacturers.  Everyone knows that Avalon mined on customer equipment.  BFL claims they don't do any significantly mining on customer equipment, but every BFL order mines for at least 24 hours on the production network by BFL's own admission.  Given BFL's history of fulfilling orders at a snail's pace and delaying production for weeks with no explanation (while the hashrate is simultaneously growing as if production continued), I am willing to bet that they have done significant mining for themselves and probably continue to do so.  I don't know as much about the other manufacturers because I lost all interest in continuing to try and mine Bitcoin after the early ASIC fiascos with Avalon and BFL.

It may not have been originally intended, but it was definitely known for several years and therefore should have been *expected* by any business engaged heavily in the Bitcoin economy.

To expand on comment, it doesn't matter how much Bitcoin appreciates, because he could always just spend the equivalent $ on Bitcoin directly right now instead of on the electricity to run the miner and he would receive more Bitcoin for the same amount of $.

That may be true, but you could just as easily kidnap any person with a large amount of money and coerce them into handing it over.  There are over 400 people in the US with net worths exceeding $1 billion.  Sure, not all of that is as liquid as Bitcoin, but some of it is.  Again, why wait for Satoshi Nakamoto when you can just check the Forbes 400?

I find it interesting that people who will mine at a certain price don't seem to buy an equivalent amount of Bitcoin at that same price.  That's what this is telling us (if it's truly the cause).  There is a large premium placed by individual miners on getting coins through mining rather than an exchange.  Otherwise, the price would not change when one miner accumulated a bunch of hashing power and dumped the resulting coins into the market.

Yes, but people who consider themselves libertarians or whose views cause others to call them libertarian cannot choose to not be associated with other people who claim to be libertarian or whose views cause others to call them libertarian.
For example, I could divide the world into two groups: people who practice religion and those who do not.  I can then find examples of idiots among those who practice religion (or vice versa) and claim that religious people are idiots.  That doesn't make it right, and it doesn't even mean that people who practice religion A agree on everything that people who practice religion B believe.  Libertarians are not a homogenous group.  If your primary exposure to religious people was through the Westboro Baptist Church, you might have very skewed ideas about what being religious means.

3. Told the bank (Gox) that they never got the money, and showed them the forged receipt as proof.
4. Gox sent them more money in a new transaction with no verification other than checking the transaction ID on the forged receipt and seeing that it didn't exist in their system.
5. This was repeated over and over, apparently without anyone at Gox auditing their actual cash in the vault (bitcoins in cold+hot storage) and matching it up to the account balances of their users (Gox's database).

*You* don't seem to understand what he was doing.  He was exploiting an arbitrage opportunity due to the $100+ price difference between Gox and everywhere else.  He was buying elsewhere (eg, Bitstamp) and selling on Gox.  He said he was doing this because he had a way to quickly get fiat out of Gox (probably a Japanese bank account).  His only risk was at the institutional level.  He had almost no risk from his trading activities.  He also said that he had 550 or more Bitcoin stuck in Gox.  That's not necessarily the entire amount he was using in his trade.

That's actually a good thing if there are new buyers for those spent Bitcoins.  It means that the distribution of Bitcoin overall is going up and it's becoming less concentrated in the hands of a few early adopters.  Of course, that depends on there being *new* buyers out there, but I don't have much data on that other than the number of wallet accounts at Blockchain.info, which is easy to see [here](  It looks like a pretty good growth trend to me even if a lot of those new accounts are just people getting second, third, etc. accounts.

They removed (or claim they removed) the + search operator maybe two years ago.  I'm not sure if it was due to Google+, but they said at the time that putting quotes around a search term was the equivalent.  Unfortunately, it isn't.

With the + operator, it always used to force Google to return only results with the term as-entered.

I have a feeling that Gox was on autopilot trying to run the exchange with as few fleshbag employees as possible.  Unfortunately, while Karpeles was enjoying his dessert-like coffee drinks and playing on the board of the Bitcoin Foundation he wasn't paying attention to the actual operation of his company.  They were probably loving all the money they were making from trading fees without doing the actual work (or paying someone else to do the actual work) of monitoring the business.

I have unlimited time off.  It's not common, but it's not novel, either.
The way it works at my employer, I get paid hourly.  But even if I work 0 hours in a given pay period, I still get paid for working 30-hour weeks.  Those unworked hours accrue while I take time off, and I work through them when I come back.  So, I essentially have a minimum salary that is 75% of what I'd make if I worked 40 hours every week.  If I work *more* than 40 hours, I get paid my hourly rate for those hours as well.  It's pretty nice.

Exactly my point.  This is the *retail customer* ToS, so when I read it as a retail customer and it says that my bids may be matched at a higher price and my offers may be matched at a lower price than what is posted in the exchange's order book at the time of my order, then it is **not good**.
The fact that they've now "[clarified]( their ToS *without* changing this wording at all does not help.  The clarification ignores and obfuscates the issue.

I know what Experian is, I'm just commenting that the reason people have had personal data stolen related to Bitcoin is almost always due to giving that data to an exchange in order to interact with the traditional banking system.
There are many reasons to run credit checks beyond borrowing as well, but that is not important.  Your personal data will always be vulnerable to attacks like this.  With the traditional banking system, that also makes your bank accounts and credit cards vulnerable.  The same is not true of Bitcoin wallets.

That is not *all* they say they're doing.  Show me where Madoff (or any other market maker) regularly executed trades at less advantageous prices than shown in the bid/ask spread on the exchange at the time of the trade.  Until someone can do that, then I am not at all convinced that this is *just* preferencing.  This is opposed to [the rules market makers must follow on US exchanges](


What ItBit says may happen is that your trade may execute at a worse price than posted on the exchange at the time of the trade.  The only way I can think of for that can happen is if ItBit's market makers are not required to execute orders at the posted bid/ask.
@_date: 2014-06-15 13:14:15
I'd love to applaud this, but there are two flaws I see in it.  First, the exchange rate fluctuation is not relevant to the discussion because more coins will always be worth more than fewer.  The second, and more important flaw in this post is that it doesn't take increasing difficulty into account and people's risk preferences.  With difficulty rising, say, ~10%/week, the risk of having a "bad" week is higher than if difficulty were constant because you're facing expected returns that are decreasing as time goes on.  Mining on a larger pool is therefore rational given the right amount of risk aversion.

Josh is a BFL employee and the owner of Eclipse Mining Consortium (a mining pool) prior to its sale to BFL.  He still maintains EMC, but that's beside the point.  Anyway, BFL makes mining hardware, but they have been *extremely* late to deliver their ASIC stuff.  Their first generation 65nm hardware was delayed over a year for many people's orders.  The new 28nm generation was originally targeted to start shipping in early December 2013.  Well, it's now almost September 2014 and *nothing* has shipped.  BFL is basically a huge failure and possibly a scam.  The real owner of the company, Sonny Vleisides, is a convicted felon.  The fact that he's the real owner of the company was hidden by registering it in his uncle's name and hiding Sonny's identity.  It only came out who he was because I connected the dots back in 2012 after hearing that a "Sonny" worked at BFL and seeing the name of his uncle on BFL's paperwork.

Actually, that's exactly what they're saying:


Without any explanation as to what circumstances this could happen, I can only assume that they mean this could happen under any circumstance.  So, if the order book has asks for $400 and you place a market order, their market maker will get the order first and may choose to fill it at any price they want, including &gt;$400.
It's certainly possible that that's not what they will do in practice (I hope so), but that is not what they actually say.

I'm assuming you take the price of Bitcoin itself as a given and don't believe that your choice in pools has any impact on it.  That is not a good assumption in this case.  You can get a bit more Bitcoin at GHASH.IO, but if it's worthless, then you lose.

We definitely need clarification.  How can you say that it's obviously not what I'm implying?  That is what they wrote.  I don't know how you can interpret the words that they wrote differently.
There is a difference between priority execution and executing trades outside the exchange's order book.  In pretty plain English, they are saying that all trades will be sent to market makers before even hitting the exchange (ie, market makers don't have to show their true bid/ask on the exchange), and those market makers will be allowed to make those trades at a price of their choosing.

It introduces complication and additional risks to both sides (eg, a merchant may choose to accept an RBF transaction because he doesn't want to lose business or simply because he doesn't notice it, and the customer then reverses it after receiving goods).
Even in the best case, non-fraud scenarios, you end up with people having to pay transaction fees to *not* move coins.  I don't view that as a great user experience.

BFL lied.  They used customers' orders to mine for themselves for at least 24 hours per device, and there is testimony from former employees that at least in some cases, it was much longer than that.  BFL would have mined a shitload of bitcoin by doing that, especially with the early orders.
It's also very possible that they didn't convert all BTC into fiat through BitPay.  They also fabricated that $1million hardware purchase (they paid the invoice themselves), and essentially used BitPay as an exchange to cash out their mined bitcoins.  Oddly, BitPay has not made any comments on this.

Yes, this will create a scenario where the government can be relatively assured that if they desire to go after someone and they know that they use Bitcoin, they can make their life a living hell and/or hurt their reputation or credibility.  That's not great news.  I don't care if they don't intend to use it that way, but the system is set up so it's wide open for abuse because they are going to turn thousands or millions of people into de facto criminals.

What the actual fuck?  Market makers maintain bid/ask spreads.  This has nothing to do with that as-written.

How did you generate the paper wallet?  Did you import the *private* key, or just the public key (so you could see the balance but not make any transactions from it)?
@_date: 2017-03-24 17:43:19
Yes, if UASF happens they'd better also do a PoW hard fork ASAP because that will be a huge threat to the chain.  At the end of the day, I think we would've been better if SegWit had been proposed as a hard fork.  At least one hard fork is probably going to happen anyway.
@_date: 2017-03-25 17:26:09
Miners set the price for transactions, and they can set them however they'd like/need in order to maximize profits.  Nothing obligates any miner to accept a zero-fee transaction.  If they do so, it's either out of charity or because they want the value of Bitcoin itself to increase due to low transaction fees.  These are facts, and I don't see how you can dispute them.
EDIT to add: this is also why you don't need to have full blocks in order to develop a fee market.
@_date: 2015-05-08 13:39:06
Those spreads should be reflected on the exchange's bid/ask spread.  They should not be determined in secret by the market maker outside of the exchange.

Those quotes are taken out of context.  Here's the context:  
Rizun was talking about the block size, not the quantity of Bitcoin.  This isn't the first time this distortion has appeared on this sub.  Even if Rizun claimed that inflation had to go on forever in order to have uncapped block size, that would be wrong.  Peter Rizun himself has shown why this is not the case, as has just about any ECON 101 professor.
@_date: 2017-03-21 03:28:41
...and Peter Todd.
@_date: 2017-03-24 22:30:16
Actually, he intended to raise the cap as Bitcoin became more popular.  Originally, there was no cap at all (~32MB in practice, though).  See here: 
@_date: 2017-03-29 22:38:31


And it's easy to see why.  In his model (at 7:10), the only cost in his equation is from orphaned blocks.  He was not including the cost of hardware, electricity, and other operational costs of mining.  This is not rocket science; it's basic economics.
@_date: 2014-03-27 16:51:51
My brother took economics for engineering students at GA Tech and said most of the people in the class were terrible at it.
@_date: 2016-01-13 13:53:23
All mining equipment acts as a heater.  Just make sure to vent the exhaust back into your house or wherever else you want heat.  However, as far as I know, nobody has bothered to integrate one into a furnace.  It shouldn't be necessary as the heat from the miner will contribute to the heat of the house and the furnace will simply work that much less to keep the temperature up.
@_date: 2017-03-30 00:00:37
That is interesting, though it has nothing to do with the Core vs. BU debate.  Their paper fails to account for changes in the value of Bitcoin itself if different mining strategies are adopted, particularly malignant ones.

This.  Miners cannot run as charities forever.  If a miner or group of miners decides to allow average tx fees to drop below the rate at which revenue equals cost, they will bleed until they either raise their price (min. tx fee) or go out of business.  It's a self-correcting problem.

Core wasn't the only node implementation that was unaffected by the assert(0) bug.  Core, Bcoin, and Classic were all unaffected.

It looks like he regularly works on Core to me.
@_date: 2017-03-29 22:29:26
Rizun was talking about supply in the context of the blocksize, not supply of Bitcoins.  In the scaling conference presentation, at 7:10 you can see why he has that proviso that inflation must be non-zero.  In that equation, he is ignoring the cost of both hardware and electricity as well as other operational costs for mining.  The only "cost" he is modeling is the cost associated with orphaned blocks due to propagation time.  The model is obviously incomplete, and the addition of the costs I just mentioned would lead to the conclusion that a fee market will develop even in a zero inflation-rate environment with unbounded block size (unless miners decide to become charities and work for free).
@_date: 2017-03-24 22:31:05
He put it in to prevent spam and [intended to raise it](
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:49:06
That is a great question!  You're thinking about it the wrong way, though.  It's not about what "measures were deployed" to prevent spam, but what changed (in any way) to prevent spam.  The key answer to that question is value.  Bitcoin now has value.  Back in 2010, Bitcoin essentially had zero value.  Someone could create transactions all day long, sending coins from one address to another, and it would cost them very little to nothing.  Meanwhile, it would cost the nodes in bandwidth and storage space.  Even if miners started demanding a fee, miners can only collect fees in Bitcoin.  Back in 2010, Bitcoin had no value and you could mine a bunch of it using your CPU!
Therefore, it was necessary to put in place an anti-spam measure because it was impossible to impose real transaction costs.  It was a way of preventing the externalities of spam attacks from overwhelming the good will of those running the Bitcoin network (because at that point, Bitcoin was essentially an experiment with people donating resources to the network for no return...in the short-run).
Anyway, now that Bitcoin does have value, transaction fees are actually effective as an anti-spam measure.  Make sense?
@_date: 2017-03-25 19:19:07
Yeah, a limit does have to exist. Who decides what it should be, though? 1MB is obviously far smaller than it should be to me, but it may be more than others (luke-jr) think is prudent. It's a tough problem.

There's far too much of that in the Bitcoin community these days, unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:55:55
Given that all the miners who signed onto NYA are still mining Bitcoin (those mining BCH are also mining BTC), they are not happy with Bitcoin Cash.  It would be easy for them to indicate so through either moving all their mining to that coin or by making an announcement.  None of them have done either of those things.  All indications are that there will be a hard fork of the Bitcoin network in November, so if there is something that Bitcoin Core or BTC1 think they need to do in order to prepare for that, they should both do so.

You can opine on how you think things should be done on the BTC1 side all day long, but the BTC1 developers don't have to do what you desire.  If you don't like that and you think it's unsafe to a degree that it will impact Bitcoin Core, then I would encourage you to encourage Bitcoin Core to protect themselves as much as possible.  Bitcoin Core doesn't have to do what you or I want them to do, either.  If you still think this needs to be done, develop and advocate for your own client in order to protect yourself.
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:24:25
Of course they'll change now that this has been posted in r\bitcoin with such an inflammatory title (basically to encourage the worst instincts among people here to try and play games that the original original posts were, on their face, trying to call out).

Yes, and it already has it.  Bitcoin Cash forked without consensus, so it's now a minority chain.  It seems like it'll probably continue on in some capacity, but who knows.

Nice edit to prove my point by linking to the readme.  In the readme, they explicitly link to a **Bitcore branch of Bitcoin Core**.  BTC1, Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic, and Bitcoin Unlimited are also branches of Bitcoin Core, but you wouldn't say that they run "on top of" Bitcoin Core.  In their own words:


Note that the repo they link to is owned by Bitpay, not Bitcoin Core (github.com/bitpay/bitcoin/tree/0.12.1-bitcore).

Peter Todd and Greg Maxwell are far too personally invested in the outcome.  I also suggested Erik since he is already in the business of exchanging cryptocurrencies.  I would be fine with Brian Hoffman if he's up for it.
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:05:17
There's no problem with it.  That upgrade note was targeted to users of **Bitcore**, which is Bitpay's node implementation.  It happens to not support SegWit yet, which means that it's not a fully validating node anymore due to SegWit activating.  They want users of *Bitcore* (again, not Bitcoin Core) to run it behind a SegWit-supporting node.  Since BitPay supports SegWit2X and the NYA, they linked to BTC1.  It's pretty simple.  Their position on NYA and SegWit2X/BTC1 is already widely known.  This isn't sneaky and it shouldn't surprise anyone.  All the outrage here is just manufactured.
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:10:12
That's very well put.  Given that we still have *some* miners creating empty or very small blocks, why not raise the blocksize cap itself to allow the network to compensate?  SegWit2X/BTC1 will do that, but Bitcoin Core developers are doing everything in their power to stop it.  I really do not wish to be in a situation where, in order to use decentralized Bitcoin, I have to use some centralized second layer solution.  Also, while the second layer solutions are still in pre-release stages, we shouldn't be stunting the growth of the network.
@_date: 2017-08-24 13:52:13
What percentage of the mempool is SegWit transactions? I would expect there to be blocks without any SegWit transactions since SegWit transactions have to be created first.

You can still mine on a CPU if you want to do so.  This is still the codified law of Bitcoin (as in literally in the application code).  I don't know why you think it's irrelevant.

Many people put forward conspiracy theories about Antpool wanting to block SegWit so it could continue to use ASICBoost.  Now that it's clear that either (a)SegWit *doesn't* break covert use of ASICBoost or (b)AntPool was mining 0-tx blocks for some other reason.  Either way, I think the conspiracy theorists owe us all an explanation.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:51:20


So use their software and run a full node.  If you're not running a full node, you're not following the Core devs.  That is their client, and it will segment itself.

We'll see.
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:02:12
You can't know, but the best indications are the hash rate signaling (~90% for SegWit2X) and explicit business and exchange support for NYA (which is substantial).  You could also look for explicit agreement or disagreement on coin.dance here:   Right now, it looks like fewer than 10% of companies listed explicitly reject SegWit2X, and the economic impact of those companies is very low in my personal estimation.  Meanwhile 24% explicitly support or are prepared for it.  This all indicates to me that SegWit2X will be the majority chain and retain the Bitcoin name post-fork.  Of course, anything could happen between now and the fork, but those are the indicators that I am using.
@_date: 2017-08-01 23:45:59
You still have to define what the group is when talking about consensus.  In the case of Bitcoin, the group is mining nodes.

Once you send any Bitcoin to an exchange, you don't control your private keys and you are subject to their terms.  You should make sure that exchanges will accept transactions from the Bitcoin Core network before sending.  If they don't accept your transactions from the Bitcoin Core network, then you'll be SOL unless they are willing to send your coins back.  What problem are you envisioning?
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:36:13
I believe they are including SegWit transactions in at least some blocks, though.  People were demonizing Antpool for supposedly blocking SegWit, though it now appears that there was no real reason for them to block SegWit in the first place even if they were using covert ASICBoost.

That's not true, but if you believe it then good luck.




Is it significant that SegWit2X signaling dropped from over 90% of the Bitcoin network to 87.5% in the past 24 hours?




Yes.  I will send you up to 21 Bitcoin Core chain coins in exchange for an equivalent number of SegWit2X chain coins after the fork if we can find a mutually agreeable method to do so.  Let me know what you propose over a private message if you're interested.

Where do you think that quote came from?  Do you have a more credible definition of consensus as applied to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:07:08
Yes, UASF did ensure a hardfork to a larger blocksize cap in addition to SegWit activation.
@_date: 2017-08-01 23:19:18
What does that have to do with anything?  Have you learned how to add to the Bitcoin blockchain without mining?
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:27:39
When referring to "nodes", Satoshi said, "they vote with their CPU power."  Unless you believe that Satoshi is not referring to "nodes" when he says "they", this means that he is talking only about mining nodes.  Those are the only nodes that matter in consensus finding.  There is no consensus to be found for a non-existent blockchain.
All non-mining nodes do is store copies of the blockchain.  They can be good or bad copies depending on the consensus among mining nodes, but they have no influence over the actual blockchain itself because they don't add to it.

Do you think Antpool was using covert ASICBoost in the past?  If SegWit is supposed to [eliminate the ability to do covert ASICBoost]( then it couldn't now be the cause of empty blocks, right?
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:19:12
If they are still using covert ASICBoost, which is causing the empty blocks, then why would they have cared to block SegWit in order to preserve their ability to use covert ASICBoost?  SegWit is live and, potentially, covert ASICBoost usage is potentially still happening.  Nothing has changed.

You're being intentionally dense and/or deceiving.  I used "2X" as shorthand for SegWit2X, i.e. BTC1, just as you did in the post I responded to.  It is 100% compatible with the current Bitcoin network and uses the same consensus code until block 494,784.  That hasn't happened yet, and since you're so well-informed I'm sure you know that as well.


If Bitcore ran on top of a current Bitcoin Core node, it wouldn't need to be placed behind a SegWit-supporting node.  The [installation instructions]( don't require you to go out and get your own Bitcoin Core node software.  Bitcoin Core is [not a prerequisite]( for the package.  Bitpay are *not* suggesting that people switch from Core to BTC1 underneath Bitcore.  They explicitly say:


So, what you've just said is false.  Bitcore does *not* run on top of Bitcoin Core.  It runs on top of a modified version of Bitcoin Core (BTC1 is also a modified version of Bitcoin Core, as I'm sure you know).  They are not advising anyone to rip out that component.  They are instead instructing you to set up a *boundary node* to isolate your non-validating node from the rest of the network.  You are spreading inaccurate FUD.
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:08:18


Bitcoin Core is losing its former status as reference implementation.  That was decided as soon as they made it clear that there would be no 2MB hard fork on offer.  I would say that the current network (ie, the blocks that have been created since SegWit2X achieved a majority of the hash rate) *is* the network which will hard fork to a 2MB blocksize cap in November.  If you [look at the blocks]( Bitcoin's rules are SegWit2X's rules since early July.


The Executive Branch doesn't make the laws, but it does enforce them.  *If* the Executive Branch doesn't enforce a law, it is essentially nullified.  But Bitcoin is not governed by the US Constitution or any similar artifact.  It's governed by code, and given that the entire foundation of that code is based on "Proof of Work", it is the workers, aka the miners, who decide what Bitcoin is by creating proofs of work and voting on which proofs are acceptable.  You cannot run the Bitcoin network without Proof of Work without a hard fork to change some very fundamental aspects of how Bitcoin works.
That is not to say that everyone else is powerless and must accede to the miners' collective will.  Everyone is free to not use Bitcoin.  I'd say that users are more like the Executive Branch and miners are more like the Legislature.  You can't have laws without legislation (miners' PoW), but users can choose not to enforce the laws (not use Bitcoin).

What that quote says is that valid blocks are determined by mining nodes.  If someone creates a block you find is invalid, you can disregard it and create your own valid one...but you have to be a miner to create blocks in the first place.  If all miners agree, as they appear to agree on SegWit2X, then this is a non-issue because consensus has been achieved.

Are you downvoting all of my posts as I make them?  That's pretty childish.  Anyway...


Companies are not obligated to indicate their support on coin.dance, so I would imagine that most of those that haven't indicated anything either way (or aren't even listed) will be a mixture of approve/support and disapprove/don't support.  I'm not too worried about them either way, to be honest.


Why would I count Bitcoin Cash hash power for SegWit2X signalling purposes?  It would only make SegWit2X's support appear higher than it actually is.  I prefer to stick with a conservative measure, which is actual signalling on the Bitcoin network.  That is 87.5% in the past 24 hours, down from over 90% earlier.




That's a tough one, so I'll leave that to you (conditional upon my approval, and I wouldn't approve many people).  I would trust Erik Voorhees (u/evoorhees), but I don't know if he'd be willing to intermediate.
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:09:00
Of course SegWit2x wants to be Bitcoin. It will end just fine as the network will segment itself. If you don't want to end up in the wrong chain, run a full node. That is what everyone on the Core side has been advocating anyway. It should be easy with the 1MB blocksize cap.

@_date: 2017-08-18 18:39:03


...which I mentioned won't happen until block 494,784.  For now, it is the same network.  It will probably also be the "Bitcoin" network after that block and the minority chain will be called something else.  This is the safest way forward given miners' and businesses' intentions as expressed in the New York Agreement.


Hash rate.  Consensus rules have always been defined on the network by mining nodes voting on the rules.  There is no Bitcoin without a blockchain, and miners make and vote on the blockchain.  However, that being said, most of the largest Bitcoin businesses also explicitly support the NYA.  You can see the list [here](  It's quite thorough and impressive in the amount of the "Bitcoin economy" represented therein.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:39:46
I disagree that the BTC1 client is malicious, but even if it were you should still demand a fix from Bitcoin Core in order to protect you from what you perceive to be malicious.  If someone announced that they had cracked SHA256 and would be attacking the Bitcoin Core network in three months, would you not demand that Bitcoin Core (or some other group) do something to protect you from the inevitable?
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:01:47
That sounds pretty desperate and pathetic. If Lombrozo wants replay protection for minority fork, he should add it, just like Bitcoin Cash did. It is not the responsibility of the majority chain to break compatibility by adding replay protection.

First off, you started by saying that you wanted the "bullshit infighting" to stop.  Then, you proceeded to write this post which stokes the very same bullshit infighting you supposedly wanted to stop.  On top of that, you chose *downvoted* posts in r\btc to make your point rather than the upvoted posts which are much more reflective of the opinion over there.  If your goal was to help bring the community together, you failed miserably.

I think this is pretty clear: 
As is this: 
If you are running Bitpay's node implementation ([Bitcore]( which is *not Bitcoin Core*) and aren't aware of BitPay's stance on SegWit2X by now, then that's on you IMHO.  If you went to the Bitcoin Unlimited blog (if such a thing exists), you shouldn't be surprised to see it link to Bitcoin Unlimited binaries.  That's essentially what this is.

This sub regularly sends posts they want to disappear to the moderation queue, which hides them from everyone except the OP.  This leads the OP to think that their post is visible, when in fact it's not visible to anyone but themselves.  They then let the posts sit in that queue indefinitely.  It's happened many times to me and a huge number of other people.  It allows posts that don't violate the rules of the sub to be silently censored with no explanation given (or bans, etc.).

Where's it from?
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:07:07
The fees scale with the size of the transaction, not the amount.  The size of a transaction is determined by the number of inputs and outputs required to create it.  If you have your Bitcoin spread across a large number of addresses, spending it can be cost-prohibitive at today's recommended fee levels.

Why would they need to mention 2X vs. the current chain?  2X *is* on the current chain, assuming you're referring to Bitcoin and not Bitcoin Cash.  Additionally, this is targeted primarily toward businesses using the Bitcore node already.  These are not people who are or were already running Bitcoin Core in the first place.  They have proactively chosen to use a non-reference node implementation: Bitcore.  BitPay is saying that since Bitcore hasn't been upgraded to support SegWit, it is unsafe to keep it connected to the network without sitting behind a SegWit-supporting node.  Since BitPay backs SegWit2X/BTC1, they linked to that implementation.  There's no foul play going on here.  They weren't trying to "trick" Bitcoin Core node users into running BTC1/SegWit2X because, as I said, those people running Bitcoin Core wouldn't have been running Bitcore in the first place.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:57:13
That's great.  You have nothing to worry about.  Just for a few blocks after the fork and you should be fine.

That is the *only* appearance of the term "consensus" in the Bitcoin Whitepaper.  That is the relevant definition.  If we want to expand it, where does it stop?  Do we also require consensus from non-holders?  What about governments?

EC had more support than SegWit-sans-2X.  SegWit2X has &gt;90% support, which is about triple what SegWit had and double what EC had.  It's going to happen.
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:15:17


Profit is the obvious answer, but you could ask directly.  Even if all 40% came from the 95% that was on BTC, NYA support on BTC would be 91.7% support for NYA remaining on the Bitcoin chain.  That is, effectively, no change at all from the perspective of a majority/minority chain/fork conversation.
Do I think there is risk in a chain split without replay protection?  Yes.  That's why I wouldn't transact until the two have safely separated.  However, I don't want the majority chain to break backward-compatibility with old SPV nodes.  It should be up to what is shaping to be the minority chain (which is clearly Bitcoin Core) to protect itself.  That's what Bitcoin Cash did, and they planned and executed that hard fork in less time than BTC1 will have done.  As to whether or not I support SegWit2X taking that gamble, I do support it.  Bitcoin Core is recklessly endangering their users by not offering replay protection.  That should be abundantly clear from block signalling.

That was simply me trying to let you know that I won't accept any random person off the internet as an escrow agent.  I don't think that's unreasonable by any means.  I suggested Erik to be the escrow agent and tagged him to see if he would do so.  I have no idea why you think Erik is a scammer.  He has run multiple, successful Bitcoin businesses without scamming anyone that I know of.  His security practices also seem more than adequate to me.
You have suggested nobody.  If you want to back out, that's fine.  I can understand why you might be afraid to follow through.

You won't lose anything during a fork if you're using their wallets, since you control your private keys.  They offered an easy way to recover Bitcoin Cash funds, so I assume they'll do the same after the upcoming hard fork.  Their wallets, however, will almost certainly follow the Bitcoin chain (SegWit + 2MB blocksize hard cap) after the hard fork.  If you don't like that default behavior, look into a wallet like Samourai.  They have explicitly stated their opposition to the upcoming hard fork/upgrade.
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:21:11
You and I have different definitions of a minority fork and perspectives on economic support for 2X. So we'll agree to disagree, I guess. Run a full node and you will be fine.

I also don't like seeing empty blocks, and I'd like it if Antpool stopped doing that either intentionally or through some sort of technical limitation or incompetence.  Whatever the case, we simply have to live with it until or unless Antpool fixes the issue or goes away.  I also think it was a bit much to demonize Antpool for supposedly trying to block SegWit in order to preserve their claimed use of covert ASICBoost when it's now very unclear whether or not they are actually using covert ASICBoost and, even if they are, whether or not use of covert ASICBoost would have been a reason to block SegWit in the first place.

Normally I would agree that the comment I just posted adds zero value to the conversation going on in this sub.  That's why I don't post comments like that to this sub...except when they are 100% on-topic.

I don't generally feel the need to hammer on this point, but *in this thread* it is incredibly relevant.
Seriously, check my other posts in this sub.  I'm pretty sure you'll find that I'm usually, if not always, on-topic and providing value to the conversation.  If I were to post the comment above on random, unrelated threads then you would have a point.  Here, however...I don't think so.

Running different code is not the same as running a different *network*.  If that was the case, then anyone running anything other than Bitcoin Core, including almost 100% of Bitcoin users who are using non-Bitcoin Core wallets, would not be on the Bitcoin network.  That's preposterous, and it's hardly worth discussing your shifted goalposts any further.
Over 90% of the network is committed to hard forking at block 494,784.  It's hardly an arbitrary fork.  Bitpay's position on the fork has been clear for months.

What I meant was that I want a single transaction to fund the escrow address on your side (doesn't have to be a single address necessarily, but that would be cleaner).  I do not want multiple funding transactions in order to keep things simple from a tracking perspective.
Regarding multisig on the escrow account, that does complicate recovery.  At the moment, I would only be comfortable with a 2-of-3 multisig wallet if we used Copay.  However, given that Copay may not support the Bitcoin Core chain after the fork, that places more risk on you.  With that said, Copay does not support Bitcoin Cash yet [does allow for fund recovery](  I'll leave that up to you (or feel free to educate me on a safer/easier method).

They don't have to monopolize the protocol.  Lightning Network requires each user to lock up funds with at least one counterparty.  They also [need to monitor the network to ensure there are no contract breaches](  Since the vast majority of current Bitcoin users do not run 24/7 nodes, I think it's safe to say that future users will also not run 24/7 nodes for the most part.  Additionally, it makes no sense to open a channel directly with every business one patronizes.  Instead, it makes much more sense to use and intermediary that is itself connected to those businesses.  That's a hub and spoke model.  Blockstream stands to make lots of money by becoming the hub.  They are also going to be very well-positioned to do so (seeing as how they're the developers of the protocol, well-funded, and well-connected).  I don't think this is "chemtrail asinine" conspiracy theory.  This is what I would want to do if I had invested in or worked for Blockstream.  And why not?  Why wouldn't they try to make money off their own invention?
@_date: 2017-04-03 03:13:39


SegWit increases the cost of running a node from a hardware perspective (more bandwidth, more storage needed).  I don't know why you think people will suddenly start running nodes 24/7 after SegWit is released.  Also, the hub and spoke model still actually makes sense rather than, say, opening up a 1 BTC channel with your favorite coffee shop, another 1 BTC channel with your favorite sandwich shop, another 1 BTC channel with your grocery store, etc. and having to close and reopen all those channels on a regular basis (since all those txs go one direction).
I'm sure that other businesses can/will run hubs, or at least throw their hat in the ring.  However, there's going to be a pretty strong network effect for the most connected hub.  That is what I would try to be if I were Blockstream (and as I've said, I think they're well-positioned to do so).  People use Facebook because people use Facebook.

You said that you wanted to make Bitcoin better in spite of people who are supporting BU, etc.  I have supported and do support BU, but I just told you that I also support this compromise, which is the whole point of this post.  This post is about Core, and you haven't explained why you think the SegWit2MB compromise is bad.  In fact, you started off somewhat dismissive because you claimed that nobody who supports BU could/would support this compromise.  If that reasoning isn't valid, what's your other reason for opposing this compromise (assuming you do still oppose it)?

LN itself can and likely will be a boon to Blockstream if they end up running the most-used hubs and can collect transaction fees.  Blockstream, being the creator of the LN likely to be implemented, would be well positioned to become such a hub.  Then they could collect lots of fees without needing to burn prodigious amounts of electricity or invest in specialized hardware.  That is the financial incentive I see involved in Blockstream's Core developers pushing for LN.  It has nothing really to do with AXA, though they are certainly an investor in the company.  How do you think Blockstream intends to make money?  It was not established as a charitable or non-profit foundation.  It's a for-profit enterprise.

Bitcoin can't really be used for transactions that small anymore as $0.20 wouldn't even cover a transaction fee these days.

If time is not much of a concern, you could always pick up mining.  Then you're directly exchanging electricity for coins.  Unfortunately, we're about to see ASICs coming online in November, and they'll make pretty much all mining hardware currently out there obsolete, which does not leave enough time to turn a profit on a hardware purchase.  Your best bet would probably be to just pre-order some ASIC hardware and wait unless you already have some decently powerful AMD GPUs.
@_date: 2012-08-27 18:13:39
This is good advice.  Honestly, my advice would be to not bother.  If you aren't going to join a mining pool, you're adding complexity and you'll likely see zero returns.  The chance of finding a block by yourself using that hardware is extremely small and will soon get exponentially smaller due to ASIC hardware, but the chance of increasing your electrical bill is 100%.

Are they serious?  How about a high school diploma and maybe some community college.  That's who will respond to that ad.  Oh yeah, and all the people with Masters degrees in English and other useless (for making money or having a job) fields.

Thanks for seeing what I was trying to get at.  I'm not sure why everyone decided they needed to downvote me for pointing out a real flaw in the system.  Every source I know of says that you should spread your Bitcoin around in multiple wallets to prevent losing them all because of a single incident.  That incident could be getting your computer hacked, or it could be the incredibly small chance that there's a collision with someone else at one of your wallet addresses.  Instead of reinforcing that piece of advice, people chose to use big numbers to show how wrong I must be.

Those 50% of people who didn't lose their bitcoin would not necessarily find they're worth twice as much as a result.  It's likely that some non-zero portion of those who lost all of their bitcoin would simply leave the market, driving down demand for bitcoin.
In fact, if something catastrophic happened to bitcoin, such as 50% of holders losing all their bitcoin, it would probably destroy bitcoin because people would lose faith in it.

I wasn't talking about finding a specific address.  I was talking about finding any address with Bitcoin associated with it.  The chances are still miniscule, but it's greater than zero and it is a weakness in the system no matter how you spin it.  There is nothing other than very high probability and/or extremely high computing power requirements to prevent your account from becoming compromised.
I'm not even saying this is a huge problem, but it could become one.  The problem with your scenario is that on the way to generating that one address you're actually looking for, you would also generate the keys for half of the possible wallets that currently existed and would ever exist.  Bitcoin would be abandoned well before that point if someone started emptying wallets as they went (and yeah, they'd need to be much faster than 100 trillion wallets/sec, but that doesn't seem impossible for a minimally determined government, for example).
With all that said, I have Bitcoin.  I'm obviously not losing sleep over it.

It's also possible that you randomly stumbled across a wallet that's been used before, in which case someone else may have access to it.  The only thing that prevents duplicate address generation with Bitcoin is the fact that there are so many unique addresses.
However, the chances of that being the explanation are very low.

Bitcoins are not susceptible to the same problems as gold and fiat dollars are when it comes to deflation.

I don't think everything he said is completely true.  These two things are definitely not true.


SHA-256 is actually defined in the whitepaper.  Changing it is a major change.  Greg Maxwell apparently views the 1MB blocksize cap as a more "defining trait" of Bitcoin than the hashing algorithm even though the blocksize cap is not mentioned at all in the whitepaper and was created after Bitcoin's initial working implementation.
The way the article is written, it's not clear if Greg Maxwell actually said this, but it's incorrect:


Soft forks are coercive for all users who are not miners (and even miners if they're in the minority).  You cannot opt-out of a soft fork.  By contrast, you *must* opt-in to a hard fork if you want to change the rules that you are using.  If you don't want to follow a hard fork, you can simply not change/upgrade your node software.  Hard forks are completely opt-in, so the author has it backward.  Again, I'm not sure whether or not Greg Maxwell said that or not, or what he may have actually said to give that impression.  It is the opt-in nature of hard forks which is actually going to enable Core and people who don't like the November hard fork to stay on a 1MB blocksize cap chain.  Everyone running non-SegWit soft fork nodes, by contrast, was forced onto the SegWit soft fork chain when it occurred whether or not they wanted to "opt in".

The 1MB limit is on legacy transaction data.  It doesn't apply to segregated witness data. Combined SegWit and non-SegWit data is capped at 4MB (the block weight).

Did you read my response to firereadery?  In particular, consider what happens when your node and all other Core 0.15 nodes ban all the BTC1 nodes which are mining over 90% of the new blocks.  What do you think that does to the chance that you will suffer from a chain reorg prior to the hard fork?
@_date: 2017-09-11 16:09:04
You don't understand the situation. Core 0.15 drops peers that signal SegWit2X before the hard fork (ie, while both are enforcing the same rules and are running supposedly the same network). This is not about dropping peers after the hard fork.

@_date: 2017-09-04 06:19:37
Thanks.  Here goes:


First off, strongly preferring a certain group of connections because they've been used in the past seems to me logically to lead to a greater chance of network partitioning, not less.  So, I disagree with that premise.  If you're worried about partitioning the network, I would think changing at least some portion of your peer connections every once in a while would actually be preferable.


Again, I disagree with the premise.  Was there any disruption to the Bitcoin network when thousands of BU and Classic nodes were DoSed?  Nope.  The network is, in fact, [pretty anti-fragile as-is](


That's fine.  Preferential treatment of peers is one thing.  *Banning* peers is another.  Again, this gets back to my first point about preventing network segmentation.  It's rarely a good thing to purposefully ignore a node that is on the same network that you are and operating under the same rules you are...unless you want to increase the likelihood of chain reorgs.  This is even more true if those peers you reject are creating 90% or more of the new blocks.


False.  SegWit2X is easy to ban and it will happen as soon as it tries sending over a &gt;1MB block to your Bitcoin Core node.  Once it does that, it's banned.  This has nothing to do with replay protection existing or not.  If you are syncing the blockchain prior to the hard fork for whatever reason, a BTC1 node is almost as good a peer as Bitcoin Core since the blockchain will be the same.  You will simply have to ban that node and find another Core node at the point where it broadcasts a &gt;1MB block.  Again...nothing to do with replay protection.


Yes, that is theoretically possible.  Is it "likely"?  No...and especially not if Core simply changed the peering priority.  It's also not catastrophic because Core has its own hard coded list of nodes to attempt to connect to first...and they are all Core nodes, and will remain Core nodes.  This seems to be much ado about nothing.

You run a Bitcoin Core 0.15 node|Bitcoin Core &lt;0.15 nodes are DoSed, you have no bridge to BTC1 nodes, you don't receive ~90% of blocks (at least in a timely manner), you become more vulnerable to double-spend attacks, your transactions don't process, or process *very* slowly, your transactions (send or receive) may be reversed after getting confirmed due to chain reorg
You like to use Bitcoin|Any business or other entity with which you want to transact could suffer from the two problems above, or may be on the "other half" of the network due to running BTC1.  You can no longer transact with this entity.

This is a hard fork:  
Look at the code in [consensus.h]( "MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT = 4000000" and "WITNESS_SCALE_FACTOR = 4".

Only if there are miners on each chain with enough hashpower to actually find blocks at the pre-fork difficulty level before giving up.
@_date: 2017-09-11 16:32:46
The original intent of this change was supposed to make the split cleaner at the time of the hard fork as 0.15 nodes would already have dropped all BTC1 peers from directly connecting.  The plan relies on old Bitcoin Core (and potentially other less popular) nodes to serve as a bridge between any BTC1 node and Core 0.15 node before that point.  Doing that does necessarily decrease the [robustness]( of the Bitcoin network and increases the risk of chain reorgs on the client with less corresponding hash power (in this case, Core 0.15).
The worst case scenario that arises from the decreased robustness of the network due to this change occurs when the bridge nodes are attacked and brought down.  That is exactly what this attack would do.  In such a case, we could have a messy chain split and potentially fork the network for a long period of time.  It's very likely that there would be severely compromised hash rate on the 0.15 side of the network, meaning those nodes/that network would essentially be stuck and unable to transact at a reasonable rate.  If the bridge nodes do come back, they will reconnect the two split networks and cause one of them to reorg.  This is precisely the risk that people like Jeff Garzik were worried about.
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:37:57
That will do very little to solve the network-wide problems, though, and if you wait until the two sides of the network either converge or completely split due to the November hard fork, you may just "freeze" your business for weeks on end.  Even after that point, depending on the hash power of different sides of the network, one could broadcast the other half's chain with more work and cause a reorg up to the point of the hard fork.  This is an awful situation.
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:14:39
I would love that, but I'm willing to support interim steps that improve the current situation where cryptocurrencies are essentially unusable due to IRS rules.
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:36:29
The BTC1 nodes are not malicious.  They will simply hard fork away from Core in the future.  The proper response to that is already built into Core, and that is to disconnect/ban those nodes when they attempt to relay &gt;1MB blocks.  Core could also add the bit signal banning logic to be effective coinciding with the time of the fork.  However, until the fork happens, all nodes should be working off the same blockchain.  Splitting the network in advance greatly increases the chance of reorgs (particularly for Core 0.15 nodes) and degrades the user experience for Core 0.15 nodes when transacting as they have to take more hops to get to and from over 90% of miners.
@_date: 2017-09-04 03:15:32
It will also ban BTC1 peers. I'd say that's pretty juvenile and doesn't improve Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:40:24
I'm talking about what happens before the hard fork.  Using the signalling bit to ban peers *after* the hard fork is a fine idea.  However, Core are not doing that.
@_date: 2017-09-10 21:38:42
If that cap was no longer applicable, then we would have already hard-forked as nodes would be allowed to make blocks of any size.  I think that should be pretty obvious to you.
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:25:03
The current IRS rules were put in place without legislation.  There's nothing to repeal in this case.
@_date: 2017-09-11 18:39:27


This doesn't happen until November.  At least until that time, it is still Bitcoin.  A very large portion of the Bitcoin network is potentially using BTC1 either to mine or conduct economic activity (see NYA signatories and coin.dance/blocks).


Replay protection only matters when you're on different consensus systems.  In other words, it only matters after a hard fork.  What I do refuse to do is talk about Bitcoin as though it consists only of Bitcoin Core nodes.  Because it doesn't.  You cannot change reality with words.

If two different node implementations are enforcing the rules of Bitcoin, both "sides" of a partitioned network could/should be considered Bitcoin in my opinion.  There have been multiple implementations of Bitcoin nodes for years, and we have always called them all "Bitcoin".  Of course, no (or very little) network partitioning has been done intentionally in the past.  You are correct that the SegWit2X fork did motivate Core to make this change, but it was a totally unnecessary change in the first place.  In a best-case scenario, it would not significantly degrade the network.  In a worst case scenario...well, that's what we potentially have now and for the next two months.  This is a perfect example of cutting off your nose to spite your face.

The problem I see with the theory that the primary reason for Bitcoin usage in China is to move wealth out of the country is that it would be impossible for the Yuan to then make up 80% of Bitcoin/Fiat transactions.  The purchases of Bitcoin with Yuan should all be matched by sales of Bitcoin for Dollars/Euros/Whatevers.  That would increase the transaction volume of currencies other than the Yuan, so it would be well below 80% of the total market.

So why falsely claim that SegWit will decrease or even hold constant the bandwidth requirements for nodes? That's simply not true.
@_date: 2017-05-03 22:50:02
This seems like counterparty risk, straight from [the LN whitepaper](


If you don't or can't monitor the blockchain when those timelocks expire, or you're unable to broadcast the proper channel state (or get miners to confirm it), you're SOL.  Since the vast majority of people don't run full nodes and will not be monitoring everything themselves, the risk is increased.
I'm definitely not arguing that on-chain scaling is the only way to go.  Clearly it is not.  We already have a lot of off-chain transactions occurring anyway.  My point here is that saying that it's somehow a "fatal flaw" that extension blocks requires you to monitor the regular block and the extension blocks to know the true state of the blockchain is pretty silly if you're saying that LN isn't similarly "flawed".
@_date: 2017-05-03 20:43:18
There's also extension blocks that should enable these solutions while also providing more on-chain scaling ability without a hard fork.

In the interest of full disclosure, I am not a UASF supporter and I favor a blocksize increase in addition to SegWit (or Extension Blocks). I'm pointing out the rules because they've been put in place to make it more difficult to have these sorts of discussions regarding scaling. Before SegWit existed as a proposal, discussion of raising the blocksize cap was censored here and linking to any software that did so would get you banned. I am trying to at least hold the moderators to some level of consistency.

Did he say that?  Do you think he had a time machine or ESP and knew that he would be tricked by Craig Wright and therefore needed to check something in quick so it looked like he still worked on Core?  A contribution is a contribution.  You either are or are not a contributor.  Gavin is a contributor, and he is actively contributing to Core.  There is no objective basis for calling XT or Classic "hostile", and while Gavin was admin he could have done much more *actually* hostile things in the repo.  Working on alternative implementations is a very silly way to be hostile when he could have kicked Wladimir out, checked in a 2MB block size increase, and been done with it.

Why would they need to "secure" a testnet?  It's all about relative hash rates, not absolute.  A hash is a hash.  It doesn't matter what hardware it comes from...unless you think SegWit2X won't work solely due to the actual difficulty of mainnet.

What YeOldDoc said.  This is a scenario that is extremely unlikely to happen on mainnet.  It would require a mass defection of miners from the agreement after lock-in.  It would be a monumentally stupid thing for them to do, but even were it to happen it wouldn't break anything.  People running SegWit2X would simply have to switch to the defectors' client *or* hardfork again to change POW/difficulty.  That is how changes to the Bitcoin protocol have always worked.
That's also why I likened this to a trial run for UASF.  UASF has no significant hashpower and is a flag day activation.  Therefore, those nodes will simply fork themselves off the network (assuming SegWit is not activated) on August 1 to a chain that is essentially dead until and unless they POW/difficulty hardfork.  That is why luke-jr and other UASF proponents have been talking about just such a fork.
@_date: 2017-05-27 00:40:57

You don't think every user, or even a significant portion of users, will go to those lengths, right?  If the whole point of LN is to scale Bitcoin and allow microtransactions, expecting all those new users to have the knowledge and resources to do what you've laid out is extremely unrealistic.  Most people don't even do that today, and Bitcoin is still confined to early adopters who tend to have resources to spare and the knowledge needed to deploy them properly.

This is a reasonable compromise, so it's unlikely that Core will offer it. Silbert's latest compromise offer is Hong Kong 2.0, and we all know how that worked out. Offering SegWit first and a HF later (maybe) is not going to work...fool me twice and all that. The real problem is that hidden interests that have infiltrated Core will do everything in their power to block any scaling other than SegWit. That's why Hong Kong failed. That's why Silbert's proposal is stupid and counterproductive, and that's why reasonable compromise like this will go nowhere. You're not the first person to propose strongly tying a HF blocksize increase to SegWit activation. They all get shot down or ignored.

It sounds like miners can signal support for SegWit and also prevent anyone from using it (assuming they have 100% of hash power) if they desire to do so.  That is why UASF will enforce nothing of importance, even if it's successful.

The benefits are only realized when clients (wallets!) upgrade.  If that doesn't happen, SegWit in soft-fork form does nothing to increase capacity.

Surely, but for that to matter we would have to worry about the hashrate opposing SegWit2X to increase to the point where it's orders of magnitude greater than the entire mainnet hashrate today after lock-in.  The chances of that happening are so slim that I wouldn't consider it to be an issue.  I would place similar odds on the world's human population going up by 500% in 9 months.  If someone wanted to attack bitcoin such that they added that much hashrate to the network overnight, we would either have to go along with whatever they want or hardfork to prevent the attack.
@_date: 2017-07-11 04:14:24
Yes, though on top of that, the hardfork would still happen because there would presumably still be hashpower on the SegWit2X chain and they would reject any chain, no matter how long, past flag day that doesn't contain a block &gt;1MB.  All this attack would do in reality is ensure there is a chain split with two viable chains.

You didn't address my question about tracking LN transactions when they're off-chain.  In fact, Lightning requires you to monitor both your open channels and the blockchain regularly to guard against malicious channel closure.  I don't see how extension blocks requiring you to monitor two UTXO sets is worse than Lightning Network requiring you to monitor essentially 'n' UTXO sets with the added risk of loss of funds if you don't monitor them all regularly enough.  Multi-hop LN transactions create quite a bit of counterparty risk if I understand it correctly.

My point is that arguing that the ability to run a full node on a Raspberry Pi is essential to scaling is silly and arbitrary.  There's no reason to fixate on the ability to run a full node on a Raspberry Pi.

The block will be withheld until there are 1MB worth of transactions to include in it.  It should either take &lt;10 minutes or maybe slightly more.  It's not a "problem" in any way.

That's no different from saying van der Laan &amp; Co are the only ones with commit access to Core?

They are all running Bitcoin on mainnet and have their own teams of developers.  Many, if not most, of these clients are updating their code for SegWit2x compatibility.
If Core want to merge changes from btc1, it should be relatively easy for them to do so since it's based on Core and written in C++.

If they cancel a bunch of orders during the waiting period every time the price rises x%, that's a great way for them to make money underhandedly.
You have to ask yourself why Coinbase would debit the account in the first place and then wait several days before canceling the order.  In my case, the money debited after 1 business day, and the cancellation came 2 business days after that.
Why do you think they would do that?  No new information was provided to Coinbase during that time, and had any actual verification of my identity and creditworthiness been done, all indications would be that I'm an extremely low risk customer.  I have no idea what information pointing toward increased risk would surface 5 days (or 3 business days) after my order and why they don't simply hold the Bitcoin during the period that a transaction could be reversed if they're that concerned.
The much easier explanations are that the price rose and they either didn't want to take a small loss (but won't admit it and hide behind "you might be a scammer"), or they actually did purchase a bitcoin with my money and flipped it to someone else for a quick profit at my expense.  Neither one of those casts Coinbase in a particularly good light.

The BIP process is just one process designed for proposing, discussing, and approving changes to Bitcoin (Core). There is nothing magic about it. SegWit2x is based on the NYA, which is is another way of proposing, discussing, and approving changes to Bitcoin. If your point is simply that btc1 didn't follow the arbitrary process designed for a specific Bitcoin client, that is not convincing at all. It's simply a appeal to authority and tradition.
Hope are you measuring community support, anyway? btc1 has overwhelming support of the miners, and that is how the Bitcoin network is secured as well as the method described in the whitepaper for determining what Bitcoin is (aka "Nakamoto Consensus").
@_date: 2017-06-02 12:58:35
This is probably because the Electrum server you are connected to is running a node that times out unconfirmed txs after 3 days.  Core, in their wisdom, recently changed this to 7 days.  So now, when you attempt to send a tx that doesn't confirm, you will likely have to wait an entire week before attempting to send it again.  Since your tx is low-fee, it may not confirm (the backlog hasn't cleared in maybe a month now?).  You second tx may or may not confirm.  You just have to wait.  This is why people wanted to raise the blocksize cap over two years ago.

A lot happens in the BIP process before a patch is accepted, but I don't care to argue semantics.  It's not important.  The point is that Bitcoin and Bitcoin Core are separate entities.


Jeff Garzik is a Bitcoin Core contributor and also the main contributor to BTC1.  The people working on BTC1 have all the credentials they need.  Most of the miners are already planning to run BTC1 as is evidenced by [over 75% signalling in the past 24 hours](  If you want to ignore reality, that's fine.  It doesn't change things.


A lot of those "100+" developers support BTC1.  There is a list of maybe 15-20 who don't.  They are a minority.

@_date: 2013-08-23 18:30:56
I'm sure they didn't expect to lose their jobs.  Remember that BFL originally claimed that products would begin delivery almost 11 months ago.  BFL has repeatedly failed to meet their own deadlines, so they owe people refunds.  I can't speak to the situation of people who paid for BFL preorders and later lost their jobs, but it makes what BFL is doing, which is already illegal, even more appalling.
@_date: 2013-12-12 13:35:01
That's not exactly true.  For just about every miner out there, the marginal electricity used to produce a coin is less in fiat than the amount they could sell that Bitcoin for.  So the amount of fiat investment required to support the price of Bitcoin is much lower than claimed earlier when talking about miners who hold coins.

That's not true.  A blade of grass can never grow to touch the moon.  There's a difference between extremely unlikely and impossible, and hyperbole decreases your credibility.  I support Bitcoin, and I hold Bitcoin, but you should be honest about what is the *possible* risks are.
Someone can only steal gold by physically breaking into a vault or area where it is stored and taking it.  Someone can steal Bitcoins through simple, dumb luck.  I can make my gold and physical possessions more secure through physical security measures, but I cannot protect my private Bitcoin keys from being generated by someone else.  The chances of that happening to my address are exactly the same as they are for any other address.  I understand that it's very low, but it's not zero.  So while Bitcoin and gold are similar in that someone can break into a physical location or a computer if you're not secure and steal them, but only Bitcoin can be stolen without needing to defeat any security measures through dumb luck.
@_date: 2013-10-17 21:28:42
Do you use electricity to heat your home when not bitcoin mining (as opposed to gas)?  Gas is much cheaper.  Even if you did use electricity-based heating, you wouldn't be saving anything, really.  You'd just be mining at no cost.  If you're displacing your gas-based heat with electricity from bitcoin mining, you're still paying the difference.

I don't know.  I too recognized some inaccuracies (such as claiming that most bitcoin transactions occur face-to-face), but overall I think it painted a pretty accurate picture.  I read the stuff about the teen buying drugs and the developer working under the table, and thought "cool!"  As far as the cashier who said digital isn't real, that struck me as some jive, hipster justification for engaging in anachronistic activities.  I got the feeling she was more clueless than wise and read that part of the story as more of an indication that people like the owner of that shop want to make bitcoin work and see it succeed.
I guess the article would turn some people off, but not me.
@_date: 2013-11-23 12:39:46
Agreed.  Coinbase canceled my first order with them after taking my money and holding it for several days.  They took another couple days to respond to my support ticket and when I asked them to put the order through (all they said they did at first was "whitelist" future transactions), they never replied.  I got my USD back several days after that.  That's pretty shitty customer service if you ask me.  I don't care to do business with them again.
@_date: 2013-06-30 13:39:01
I've noticed this as well in the past few days.  The hash rate of the pool has definitely been rising.  Given Eclipse's BFL affiliation and that it's pretty much the default pool for EasyMiner, I'd imagine that this could be either a)people plugging in their BFL miners or B)BFL mining for themselves to "test" the machines before shipping (which we know they're doing).

Also, if anyone recalls the "bullet run" they did for the 65nm ASICs, it turned out to be an epic failure.  If you expect to get a Monarch before the middle of next year, you're delusional.  At this point, I'd say you'll be lucky if you see one of these things produced at all.  I'm about to cancel my Single order because BFL seems incapable of shipping them.
They claim that they won't refund anyone, but that's why I used PayPal.  I'm sure the only reason they switched to bitcoin-only for new orders is so they don't have to worry about pesky consumer protection policies.

It's been over 24 hours now.  They still have the money.  My biggest problem with the way they operate is that it would be extremely easy for them to do the following:
* Take my money
* Purchase Bitcoin
* Wait
* Sell Bitcoin to another person for much more money since the price went up just before my order was marked "high risk"
* Refund my money, leaving Coinbase with a hefty profit
@_date: 2013-04-05 12:34:31
There is almost no "preparation" needed to switch or choose a pool.  All you have to do is find another pool, create and account, and configure your miner to use the appropriate URL and username/password combination.  That's it.  How is that difficult?
@_date: 2013-07-20 13:45:01
Avalon has been confirmed to have shipped batch 3.  You're also forgetting BFL which is continuing to ship and has a massive backog of hashing power to release.  Then there are other potentials like BitFury and KnCMiner.  Holders of ASICMiner shares and potential investors in them should be aware of this because it's going to continue to impact return on ASICMiner stock.
@_date: 2013-08-09 20:39:04

Just to update you, they responded to me this past Sunday saying that I was whitelisted for future transactions, but without making any reference to my canceled transaction.  I replied asking about it and reaffirming that my preference was to process that transaction, but I got no reply.
This morning I received an ACH credit back from Coinbase for the amount of the original order.  They held my money for over a week, whitelisted my account for *future* transactions, and canceled my first order that I was using to test the service.
Not again.  I've closed my account.  I'm not ininterested in making interest-free loans to Coinbase, and I find their business practices of debiting accounts first and asking questions later to be extremely questionable.  Consider yourself warned.

I agree that it's plausible, but the chance of it happening seems extremely low.  Each ASIC being produced by Avalon and BFL is the equivalent of at least a dozen top-end graphics cards, and more frequently the equivalent of 120 or more top-end graphics cards.  If a single ASIC replaces 120 7970s, it would take a whole lot of GPU miners quitting at once to drop the hash rate.  Many GPU miners may even mine for a while after it becomes unprofitable (especially the more casual ones and the people with access to free electricity).
The hash rate has doubled over the past month, and I would be that is due entirely to ASICs coming online since it would be stupid to buy new GPUs for mining Bitcoin right now.  On top of that, GPU mining has been more profitable on Litecoin for a while and a lot of Bitcoin GPU miners have been switching already.  The ASICs have only just gotten started.

It's hard to believe Josh.  BFL is purposefully trying to hide the number of orders that a)exist and b)have been shipped.  Given the piss poor information they *do* provide and some poor information that people have volunteered, people have tried to analyze what the backorder queue actually looks like.  What else should  they do if they want this information, Josh?  When you refuse to provide better information that you clearly have, you cannot rightfully criticize people for using the information they *do* have.
It boils down to the fact that BFL are hiding these numbers for their own benefit.  I'm inclined to believe that the analyses they've poo pooed are more accurate than they want people to think.  Otherwise, they could simply release actual numbers and prove everyone like Kelticfox wrong, because anyone looking for information on BFL's backlog sees this stuff.  If it was inaccurate and painted a worse picture of the situation than the real numbers do, then BFL would be better served to release those numbers.  They haven't, so I'm inclined to believe these analyses are roughly accurate or even optimistic.

Put some into a few of your favorite altcoins (if you have any) and/or take some out as cash and invest it in something more traditional (like a Wisebanyan Roth IRA/traditional account or something similar...or pick some low-fee ETFs yourself).  However, I'm assuming you have essentially no assets outside Bitcoin.  If you already have a large amount of savings or other assets, you may not need to diversify.

I thought they said they were going to stop pulling that kind of crap.  As far as I can tell, their "high risk" determination algorithm has an extremely high rate of false positives.

BFL deleting posts doesn't change the facts, no matter how much they may wish it did.  All BFL preorder customers who placed orders are legally eligible for refunds.  BFL trying to wave their hands and say "all sales are final" does not apply when a sale has not yet occurred.

That's terrible.  I had a similar, but much less impactful experience for several years when my name was on some Homeland Security/TSA watchlist.  They wouldn't let me do online check-in.

Using Bitcoin for commerce increases its value.  If nobody spent Bitcoin on goods and services, the market for Bitcoin would contract.  If the market contracted, Bitcoin would lose value.

You would need something capable of over 2.5TH today, but since the difficulty keeps going up, you would probably have to increase that by ~20-40% every 10 days.

My BFL miners connected to Raspberry Pi run into issues about once a month of 24/7 usage, but I think it's the Pi/cgminer (which is on wifi too).  I never really investigated since unplugging it and plugging it back in again brings it back up.  It's been running great for several months now.

You can still use cash to buy very expensive things, you just have to have a lot of cash.  If governments give up their fiat money, it will probably become a rare collectible so you could still purchase some amount of Bitcoin with it.  However, at that point we'll probably look at it as using Bitcoin to purchase a collector's item.
I don't expect that to happen anytime soon, and perhaps not in my lifetime, but it *could* happen.  You never know.  A lifetime ago, there were no computers, credit (or debit) cards, etc.

They didn't fix my transaction with them.  I registered and placed my first order on 10/31.  They took my money and then days later decided the transaction was "high risk".  I emailed them to ask what was up and they offered to whitelist future transactions.  I asked if they would process the order at the original price (since bitcoin appreciated 75% during that time), and got no reply.  Several days later, my money arrived back in my checking account and I closed my Coinbase account.  Their risk-determining algorithm is BS and they know it.  They did no additional verification of my identity to warrant whitelisting and yet didn't put the transaction through as I asked.  I checked my credit score in case something there caused them to flag my transaction, but it's completely clean and my credit is excellent.
So no, they don't fix all their problems.

You don't seem to want to understand, but that's ok I guess.  A miner is not only an investment in bitcoin due to the fact that you can convert it to goods and dollars (money is fungible), not to mention the important fact that you also have a miner that can be resold (and you are ignoring that resale value in your calculation).  You seem to only want to talk about half the story.

Yup.  It is fairly ridiculous.  I think it cost me something close to $65 to get $50 worth of Bitcoin through BitInstant when I tried it a while ago, and then it took over 24 hours to actually get my Bitcoins.  There's always localbitcoins.com, but I haven't used it myself.  After the BitInstant experience and the fiasco with Bitfloor being hacked, I invested in an ASIC preorder.  We'll see how that one works out ;)

It feels like you don't control your money because, in all honesty, you don't.  The bank has it.  The second you hand over your money to the bank, it can fairly easily be stolen from you.  I don't hate banks or anything, and I've got a bank account, credit card, etc.  That's just the way it is.
I guess the bitcoin equivalent would be like having some other person keep all your bitcoins for you, with you not having the private key.  Every time you need to move them around, you have to go see him in person and explain why you need him to move your bitcoins.  Oh, and if the government decides they want your bitcoins, they can just go to that guy and he'll hand them over.

What takes that algorithm 6 days to work?  I didn't attempt any other transactions during that time.  Should I have placed another order before the first cleared?  That's the only thing I could have done differently that Coinbase would have seen during that time.  I work in analytics myself, and frankly that's a bullshit excuse.
They admitted they were wrong and cost me almost $200 (because they locked up my money for over a week while the price of Bitcoin skyrocketed).  They didn't honor my order even after they admitted fault.  I got my refund several business days after they whitelisted me and after I requested that they process my order.  That's what the problem is.

It's pretty naive to say that gamblers are not "real" users of Bitcoin.  That's one of the primary reasons people use Bitcoin, along with buying drugs.

Pretty much this.  The reason deflation has gotten a bad rap in the 20th and 21st centuries is because it is associated with the Great Depression where deflation was actually being caused by money disappearing due in large part to the fact that we had 1)fractional reserve banking, 2)no FDIC, and 3)bank failures.  Money literally started to disappear in large quantities and people freaked out (rightfully so), so as quantity decreased, demand for holding money also increased.
Of course, the Great Depression was a poor example of what Bitcoin deflation would look like (or any deflation outside crisis situations).  There is nothing about deflation that makes it inherently worse than inflation.  Central planners tend to love inflation, though, because it allows them to collect what's called "seignorage revenue".  That's essentially the value of newly printed money that they get to spend first before it causes inflation in the broader economy.  Inflation is a tax on currency holders, and it's a tool that the government and well-connected elite can use to enrich themselves at the expense of the rest of the population.

What was the point of your first comment?  You were critiquing the OP's use of the word "busted".  Why did you bother making a semantic argument if you believe it's useless?  I'm not trying to be an asshole here, but come on.  You could have left my comment alone, but instead you decided to defend your incorrect definition of a word.  Now, instead of saying, "Yeah, I mistakenly tried to bust the OP on his usage of the word 'bust' when it was me who had the wrong definition", you are saying that your original comment was 'useless'.
As you said, you already got the point.  So I guess my point is that you should stop making 'useless' arguments or you should just admit when you're wrong *or* you should have the grace to stop arguing a point into the ground once you know that you've lost the debate.

I'm not sure why anyone would need or want that kind of service with Bitcoin, though.  You're just exposing yourself to extra risk.

I certainly don't, but it seems that a lot of people do.  Why they do it is a mystery to me.  I experienced Coinbase's piss poor customer support first-hand.  Prior to trying to use Coinbase, I saw both positive and negative posts about them in this subreddit, so I figured it was a bit of a gamble either way.  When I report back here on my experience, I inevitably get people responding who claim that it's somehow my fault that Coinbase took my money, held it for over a week while Bitcoin rapidly increased in value, and did not end up giving me my Bitcoin at the price when my order was placed (which was also the price when the first ACH cleared...the meteoric rise came later).  In fact, they gave me no Bitcoin at all.  It took them days to respond to my support request, and they never responded to my follow-up.  I canceled my account.

People should take that into account when considering what this guy is saying.  He has a huge vested interest in his predictions coming true.
@_date: 2013-12-29 18:09:07
I think I should start off with saying the DeLong appears to be an idiot.  He says that there is a ceiling on the value of gold because of mining tech and a ceiling on the value of the dollar because the Fed can control the money supply.  He then says that difficulty provides a ceiling for Bitcoin value (until 21 million exist).  That is wrong and stupid.
Bitcoin's value is not constrained by the difficulty algorithm.  If people value Bitcoin more highly, mining power will be added until *mining* becomes unprofitable.  That says absolutely nothing about the value of *Bitcoin*, though.  Supply is roughly controlled, and as every economist should know, supply and demand determine price, and price x quantity determine value.  DeLong clearly either doesn't understand Bitcoin, doesn't understand Economics, or both.
Anyway, on to DeLong's "great" question:  what puts of floor on the value of Bitcoin?  The answer to that, Professor DeLong, is again supply and demand.  That is to say that there *is no price floor*.  Now, I would like DeLong to explain why that's a problem and why having no price floor is any different from having the extremely feeble price floors he cites for USD and gold.  Honestly, if nobody demanded USD for anything other than paying taxes, it would be worth very little compared to its worth today.  If people chose to not pay taxes, it would have less value than plain paper because it's already got crap printed on it.  If people decided that they no longer wanted to invest in gold to sit around in vaults, its value would plummet.  Sure, you could then still use it for jewelry and electronics, but the investment value would be completely destroyed.
DeLong seems to be betting that his audience is too stupid or sycophantic to call him on his bullshit.

That's why I still care about the design.  I don't really care about profiting on being the first person with an ASIC.

It seems that most of the hacking and loss incidents with Bitcoin actually come from people storing their private keys with a third party service, though, and not from having their own computer hacked or even from hardware failure.

If you are puzzled by stocks that don't pay dividends, you may want to consider reevaluating your theory of commerce and value.  Stock owners have equity in a company.  They own a (usually very small) piece of it.  If someone wants to purchase the company, they have to purchase it from a stockholder.  So yes, the value of a stock is exactly what someone else is willing to pay for it.  However, that's no different from the value of a car, house, clothing, food, or anything else.  There is no such thing as inherent value, though the market may make you believe otherwise because it usually does a good job of finding stable prices for goods and services (all of which are sold, by the way, and I doubt you'd call a grocery store as a ponzi scheme).
Just because there is no inherent value doesn't mean that every asset has zero value.  It means that value can only be estimated.  Just as you want to estimate future dividend payments, you also must estimate future share value when determining ROI.  If you believe that all your assets now have zero value, then I would like to purchase them.  All of them.

I wonder if someone decided to short Bitcoin and then burst the bubble by holding price steady until sell orders press it down.

I think the article is not saying that volatility isn't a problem, but that volatility isn't a permanent problem.  Obviously, if Bitcoin remained extremely volatile forever, that would be a problem.  However, once the exchange markets become more liquid, volatility should decrease dramatically.  The fact that there are *huge* price differences between the various exchanges is evidence that we haven't reached a point where there is good liquidity yet.  It always pains me to look at the different exchange rates and wish there was a way to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity.

I actually agree with you that at some point ASICMiner share may very well become worthless.  That could happen because electrical costs make mining prohibitively expensive for them.  Of course, it could be that with the profits retained by ASICMiner, they keep ahead of the technology curve, shrink their process, and tune their mining hardware so that they become a dominant force in Bitcoin mining.  Nobody can know.  The way an investor should evaluate the stock is the expected total return, which would include any future dividends as well as the value of the share itself, which is determined in ASICMiner's case entirely by the proceeds from mining distributed to shareholders.

If you do a rough exponential regression using the form y=b * m^x then you end up with approximately y=853 * 1.46^x where x is measured in months.  To solve for y=10^78, x~=456 (38 years).  That's pretty back of the envelope, and I assume the trend will flatten long before then.  Anyway, the point is that this isn't some sort of fantastical probability.  Yes, 10^78 is a large number, but exponential growth achieves large numbers and so does stable growth over sufficiently long periods of time.
FYI, these are the eyeballed x,y pairs I used for that regression:

An increase in the money supply can cause inflation, yes.  But a constant money supply with a decrease in output can also cause inflation.  Whenever the amount of money grows at pace relatively faster than the output of the economy (holding velocity constant), inflation ensues.

If bitcoin stays just as likely to be hoarded in the future as it is now, that will have no impact on inflation or deflation.  As far as "massive" deflation goes, it depends on your definition of massive.  Real GDP doesn't usually grow in a manner I would describe as massive.  Also, fiat currencies face the same problem.  The US Fed targets 2% inflation most of the time, so prices are constantly changing in USD as well.

I wasn't going to sell any Bitcoin on Coinbase.  Say I wanted to purchase a Trezor, which cost exactly 1 Bitcoin.  The price of the Trezor rose 75% while Coinbase held my money.
Additionally, Coinbase themselves could have easily made a huge profit on my order while giving me shitty service.  Assuming they purchased the Bitcoin when my ACH debit cleared (note: when it cleared, not when my order was placed, which was several days earlier), it appreciated rapidly in the following day.  That is how their business supposedly works anyway (that they purchase immediately upon receiving funds).  If they resold that Bitcoin to someone else using money they received from me, then that is pretty shitty.
Nothing I was trying to do relied on the ability to buy or sell instantly.

That configuration is probably the easiest part of setting up a miner.  I'm not trying to jump on anyone, here, it's just that what you were saying doesn't compute.

In any case, it's not your responsibility alone to ensure that BTCGuild stays below 51%.

We'll see how many cancellations come in, but Coinbase could make a lot of money cancelling orders as long as the price is rising.  All they have to do is take your fiat, buy bitcoin, sell the bitcoin to someone else for more, and refund your money.  It's a great scheme when the price is going up.
Unless you have any actual evidence, I would *not* assume Coinbase is having money problems.

@_date: 2013-11-12 16:32:21
I am patient, but I don't tolerate BS.  They could have put the order on hold for 30 days or however long it would take to make the transaction irreversible (or extremely hard to reverse) on the ACH side of things.  That would have been acceptable.
Doesn't it strike you as odd that they would whitelist me for future transactions when I haven't done *any* more verification of identity than I did previously...and obviously I still have no transaction history?  It makes no sense.  Their "fraud detection" policies don't make sense.  They will continue to not make sense no matter how patient I am.
My own fraud detection policy results in me not doing business with a company that shows itself to be untrustworthy.  The chance that Coinbase used my money to make a quick $150 went from 0% before I ordered to &gt;0% after I ordered.  In other words, my trust in them went down.  That, combined with fairly unresponsive and unhelpful customer service, does not make me interested in doing any more business with them (or providing them with additional interest-free loans).

In hindsight, you can also evaluate whether or not it was a good decision to invest all your money in Microsoft in the early 90's or to have a diversified portfolio.
You are also not taking into account one big reason to have a miner, which is to obtain anonymous bitcoins, and as I said, you're not taking the future exchange rate into account either.  If you converted all those bitcoins into USD now since you didn't purchase the miner, then your investment is closed.  However, the miner investment is still ongoing.  You are still making assumptions about the future in your calculations.

Because in the end, all that matters is consumption.  You can't eat dollars or bitcoins.  You also can't house or clothe yourself with them (well, for the most part).

I wouldn't keep my bitcoin there, even if I trusted them.  If they have your private keys, then you don't control your Bitcoin (or you aren't the only one who controls it).  If they were hacked, you could lose everything.  If a nefarious employee decided to go rogue, you could lose everything, etc.
And I said, "even if I trusted them" because I don't trust them.  I set up an account and ordered 1BTC on 10/31.  They debited my account and kept my money for over a week, but canceled my order as "high risk" and didn't process my transaction even after I contacted support to ask them to do so (getting any reply at all took several days and they only offered to whitelist future transactions).  I have excellent credit; I checked after that fiasco because I was curious what could have flagged me and it's 788 at all three bureaus.  During the time they were holding my USD, Bitcoin appreciated by about 75%.  Who knows what they did with my money during that time, but they could have easily purchased the coin for me and resold it to someone else, pocketing a nice profit even after refunding me.
So no, I don't trust Coinbase.

Ok, so let's see that statement that's not about prices:


Huh?  If you grow the money supply at a rate faster than the growth in goods and services, all else being equal, you get increased prices.  The 1919 Fed definition of inflation is most definitely about a rise in prices.  If it wasn't, they wouldn't have included the portion I put in bold.

I'm running Bitcoin-qt, but I'd like to switch away from it soon.  The main thing I don't like about Multibit is that each version creates a new directory in my Windows program files for its version number instead of installing over itself, etc.  It's annoying, but that's the direction I was leaning.

I didn't read it, but it sounds like my point that there's no proof of money laundering through the service holds true.  I'm not disputing that they violated laws, simply that there's proof of money laundering.  It sounds like the indictment agrees.

I received one of my orders (for a Jalapeno) a while back, but I have not received my order for a Single.  The way BFL are handling production and fulfillment is a joke.  Jalapeno production is 6 months ahead of Single production and there is no explanation for it from BFL.  I think the reason is that they are trying to keep the hashrate as low as possible for as long as possible so they can sell more hardware.
@_date: 2013-06-19 05:13:08
You could also have simply told them that it was a gift.  They would probably ask your friend to sign a letter attesting to that fact or something.  It happens a lot.

I didn't say this was a scam because it's a no-name startup.  I said it's likely a scam because they supposedly plan to use *multiple process nodes* to produce their chips.  There is no reason to do that, and there are a lot of reasons not to do it.

This is a pretty good resource: 
It shows how quickly the hashrate/difficulty is going up, which basically means how quickly the return on mining is going down.  They also have news on the side about the various ASIC producing companies.  Keep in mind most haven't shipped and all of them have a huge backlog even if they are shipping, so if you order now you probably won't receive any hardware until 2014 (if ever, because there are scams out there).

That math is irrelevant when molecular structure and physics dictate that a blade of grass cannot grow that tall, period.  10^-78 is greater than zero, but it's not as if a single new address is the only event you have to worry about anyway.  ∞*10^-78 is what I'm worried about.  Presumably my Bitcoins will outlive me and I could pass them down to my heirs, etc.  The Bitcoin network has no shelf life.  It can go on forever.  As long as it goes on, new addresses will be generated.
Also, I have never at any point voted your comments down.  I'm not sure why you think I did.

How would switching pools increase your risk?  I don't understand.  You don't even have your Avalon yet, do you?  There are several pools recommended now by Avalon: 
@_date: 2013-06-13 17:00:06
Yeah, the "quantitative easing" that has been going on for the past few years is actually not increasing the amount of money in actual circulation.  All it's doing is greatly expanding the amount of reserves that banks hold at the Fed.  Monetary policy has essentially been a moot point for the economy as a whole.  The only beneficiaries of QE have been banks.

I don't really see this as doing much of a service for the network.  The network has more than enough mining power already, and if you're worried about centralization, using the ASICMiner USB devices won't do much to help.  They have such a low hashrate compared to other ASICs that I don't see them having an appreciable effect on preventing a 51% attack from a large pool or otherwise.  They're just one of the least efficient ways to get into mining.
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:18:58
I was fine waiting for even 30 days.  They canceled the order after taking my money and tied it up for a total of more than a week.  That's why I have a problem with them.  If I had actually had my order processed, I would not have cared how long it took.
@_date: 2013-08-27 00:24:09
That's very cool.  I also figure you probably won't get much, if any, people paying with Bitcoin yet, but with places like Coinbase making it so cheap and easy to implement I think the question becomes why *not* accept Bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-01-14 15:27:33
Yeah, that happens fairly regularly on Bets of Bitcoin.  A lot of bets are worded poorly so that you can put bets down after you already know what the outcome will be.  When that's the case, there's no reason at all to "bet" before you know the outcome.
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:03:36
I don't think this would work for many reasons.  One of which would be fraud on the part of your depositors.  They could claim that their account was hacked, etc.  Also, it tends to be easier to clean out Bitcoins than it is to do so with regular cash.  If you hack the server hosting a wallet, you have all those Bitcoins.  If you stored the Bitcoin deposits in offline wallets, they just need to find and steal those physically.  The cost of breaking up deposits into small offline wallets and then securely storing them in multiple locations would be large.  I really don't see it being feasible.
@_date: 2013-01-13 20:24:34
At this point, you should wait until there are ASIC actually being delivered to customers before placing any order.  Then we'll have a good idea what the impact on the difficulty rate (and profitability) will be as well as if the ASICs from one company or another are anything other than vaporware.

They shouldn't have taken the money in the first place if they thought I was high-risk.  Nothing changed in-between when they took the money and when they canceled the order.  My credit history is perfect at all three agencies and the score is very high (788), so any sort of credit or background check would have come back clean.
I won't give them a break as they held my money while Bitcoin appreciated over 75%.  They prevented me from using that money to purchase somewhere else during that time, and their customer support was terrible.

@_date: 2013-09-10 15:21:03
Didn't they produce the chips, build hardware, and mine with them?  I know that was the speculation.
Even if they stored preorder funds in a wallet and they never moved, that could have been used as collateral for production, which they then completed, mined to cover costs + some profit, and allowed them to pay their manufacturers, etc. and refund customers while ending up with a bunch of hardware and profit.

The build quality on the unit he received appears very questionable, to be honest.  I'm worried about the power supply they used.  The unit is supposed to run continuously at 400 watts, which for a desktop PC is a pretty heavy load.  The PS didn't appear to be anything special...not even high-end consumer grade stuff.  The fan also appears to be mostly blocked by the ASIC modules or whatever they are.
I'm also a bit paranoid when it comes to power supplies due to my extremely poor luck with them.

They weren't "off a little" in their estimates.  They originally estimated that they would ship in Fall 2012.  They actually started shipping in June 2013, but only in very low quantities.
I agree that it's possible that they weren't knowingly misleading people (ie, lying), but you cannot say with a straight face that their estimates were just "off a little".

I got a response yesterday (finally) after emailing them on Wednesday that they have "whitelisted" me so my *future* transactions would go through, but they gave no indication about the status of my Bitcoin order or refund.
I really don't understand why they would flag an order days after withdrawing funds.  Nothing about the act of actually getting the money should indicate a *higher* risk of fraud.

That may drop in the future if the price continues to rise and transaction fees in BTC drop, but the reason for that is that are the transaction fees.  It would take a significant cut out of your earnings to pay the transaction fee to get the coins into your wallet.

I understand that.  At least if someone breaks into your home, the police can potentially find your property and return it to you.  There is no way to do that with Bitcoin.  And when I say that someone could come upon your private key, that doesn't mean they have to be targeting you.  As more and more addresses become used, the chance of stumbling upon one already in use increases.  Again, I think the chance is extremely low.  That's why I have and use Bitcoins.  I just think it's not a good idea to put a lot of your wealth into them, because once they're gone, they're *gone*.

It's pretty hard to say, but it's very doubtful you'll be one of the first to get one.  BFL is claiming that shipping will begin, at the earliest, in late January.  If I was you, I wouldn't expect anything until March at the earliest, and very possibly later.

@_date: 2013-08-19 18:37:29
Does anyone remember when BFL claimed that they learned their lesson after some delays and spec-changes on the FPGA line and that the ASICs would be much better at being on-time and on-spec?  Well, since I believe the opposite happened in reality, we could extrapolate that BFL is actually going to face more delays and more issues with keeping things in-spec than with the current batch of ASICs.
I guess that means you should expect these orders to start arriving sometime in the middle of 2015.
@_date: 2013-02-05 23:40:35
Yes, those were the first attempt using QFN packages.  BFL found that they got too hot and would probably not be a viable long-term solution, so they switched the packaging to BGA.  Those are supposed to finish production (for the first batch) by the end of the week.
@_date: 2013-07-04 13:13:52
You have to make assumptions about the exchange rate of dollars and pesos in the future as well as the difficulty of "mining" dollars, so you can't say for sure one way or another.

You could always move some of the coins to a different address that you control temporarily and then move them back after the other wallet owner liquidates the remaining coins to another address.

I view it similar to restrictions on smoking in the US.  Smoking is legal, but in some areas you essentially can't smoke anywhere but inside your own home or on your property, and in order to do even that, you have to live in a single-family home.
It seems to me that China has said that Bitcoin is "legal", but you can't use it for commerce, and you can't do anything to connect the traditional banking industry to it.  That essentially makes Bitcoin only something that you can buy and sell in person for cash.
@_date: 2013-07-01 18:33:38
Yeah, this is obviously where the scammers go in the bitcoin world.  I think that eventually there will be a lot of bitcoin escrow services out there.  Unless I'm buying something in-person or from a very well-known, non-scam company, I'm reluctant to send bitcoin to random people in exchange for goods or services.  Escrow services could allow small bitcoin businesses to gain customers and credibility as they get off the ground.
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:18:58
If Bitcoin is treated as a commodity (which I assume it is), then BTCChina would still be counted as a broker, and brokers are treated as financial institutions in the US.  Apparently China is different, which is fine.  It's just not something that makes sense on its face to an American.

Have you factored in shipping cost + time (and the high opportunity cost of not mining on them) to and from China for an Avalon unit versus that of a smartphone?  It makes a ton of sense to test products when shipping is very expensive, takes a long time, and there is time sensitivity.  It would also depend on the known/estimated failure rate.  We don't know what percentage of Avalons actually pass/fail testing.
I would frankly be upset and question their judgement if they were not testing them (though it doesn't have to be done on the main/live network).
@_date: 2013-05-05 14:26:25
The problem I foresee for ASICMiner is that they may run into a situation where they, and everyone else, has bought so many ASIC devices that mining on ASICs is unprofitable at the rate they pay for electricity.  In that case, they'll have specialized ASICs that can't turn a profit and are therefore worth very little, and they won't be able to pay any dividends to shareholders.  A lot of solo miners on their own don't mine for profit.  I do it to avoid exchanges.
@_date: 2013-10-01 03:45:42
But the difficulty is fixed in the short run.  Your chance of solving a block over any given length of time is actually the same.  You'll have a higher chance of solving blocks if you're not on BTC Guild, but blocks will, on average, take proportionally longer to solve in the first place.  So the return on a DDoS such as this is zero or negative (if it costs money to run the attack).  It would only produce positive return if you're able to influence the difficulty adjustment to make it lower.  However, a DDoS sustained over such a long period of time would basically assure that all miners on BTC Guild or any other pool would have switched, and it would again negate your profit.
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:25:25
I think the best solution to this is to simply not do business with anonymous people over the internet.  There are a lot of people who operate Bitcoin-related businesses out in the open using their real identities.

I had preorders with BFL, but thankfully they were early enough that I've already received them and they've more than paid for themselves.  I can mine profitably until the difficulty increases dramatically (something in the 10x range, but I haven't looked at it too closely since it's pretty far off).  Once it becomes unprofitable (assuming the price of BTC stays the same or drops), then I'll evaluate whether I want to bother mining anymore or not.  I think Bitcoin is a good investment, so I may mine even though it becomes unprofitable at today's exchange rate.

The more important metric is the percentage of value-holding private addresses in the keyspace.  On average, you'd only have to crack 1-x% of the keyspace to run across a key with bitcoins associated with it.  You certainly wouldn't need to calculate every single private key, though that would completely compromise bitcoin and make it worthless for everyone.

BFL could be assholes to their customers all they wanted if they actually delivered on their promises.  Unfortunately, you can't be an asshole to your customers and also fail to deliver.

No, many power supplies for PCs now have active PFC and don't need to be switched.

They also canceled my 10/31 order for 1BTC after the price had risen 75% (and I did attempt to jump through all their hoops with emailing customer support).

I'm betting that this is coming on the heels of a deluge of refund requests from BFL preorders, especially preorders which were placed so long ago (60 days) that they fall outside the window where PayPal will issue a refund automatically.

I have to agree.  This guy made that comment based solely on looking at trend lines.  He said there's no fundamental reason why he expects that to happen.  Anyone can look at a trend line and make a prediction without any foundation, but it's not really news or interesting.

This is true.  Having Bitcoin concentrated in the hands of a few people (relatively speaking) also makes it more fragile as a currency and prone to dramatic price fluctuations because there's so little liquidity and people who hoard Bitcoin may panic sell if it turns out people don't really value it highly as a savings instrument.

They're trying to grow.  They're a new company, and like almost all new companies they're focused on gaining marketshare (which means future profits) rather than profits now.  That's how almost all businesses operate.

Luke *did* travel to BFL, though I'm not sure if he stayed their til now.  I think he was there a week or so ago.  Anyway, with the magic of the internet, it's also possible that Luke Jr. worked remotely on BFGMiner using an ASIC physically at BFL.  Developers work remotely all the time...

I have a ton of complaints about how it took more than a year for me to receive an order that they initially projected I would receive in a handful of months.

I'm pretty sure Krugman does it to belittle Bitcoin.

Does Dwolla realize that, as far as I know, most of their business is due to Bitcoin?

It depends on your definition of "saving".  You'd still be spending the same amount as always on electricity.  You'd just be getting some "free" bitcoins while you're at it.

I think the growing pains that Bitcoin is facing are at least partially due to its deflationary nature.  Since the currency is still in its infancy and people expect the value to rise significantly over time, it's hard to get them to sell or use Bitcoin to purchase anything.  Because those Bitcoins are off the table as far as exchange goes, a very small percentage of the Bitcoins in existence set its price.  That leaves it vulnerable to manipulation.

That's all great, but his technical analysis is pretty strong.  Assuming he didn't fabricate it, the chance that those trades are "legitimate" market forces is basically zero.

The same bitcoins probably went in circles and passed through Silk Road multiple times.

It is legal tender somewhere, though.  IANAL, so I don't know if that actually matters to the gov't/lawyers.

I think the idea is that a person with a whole lot of bitcoin might want to purchase it as an investment/flip and use it as a way to turn a very large amount of bitcoin into dollars.

They used Bitpay and nobody here knows how much, if any, was kept as BTC rather than USD.

I believe you need a credit card.  You might be able to use a prepaid card, though, and you can purchase those with Bitcoin either directly or by converting to USD and then buying a prepaid card.
