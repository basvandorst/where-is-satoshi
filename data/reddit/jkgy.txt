And because it's so competitive, only the most technologically up-to-date miners will remain securing the network rather than a handful of early adopters as you would have with POS.

IMO this would be better if it was pay per byte rather than pay per minute.

This is exactly what Josh Garza said when people began exposing his ponzi scheme.
There's a simple test investors can use to determine whether an investment is legitimate or some sort of illegal pyramid/ponzi scheme.
You just have to ask, are investor returns generated from sales of a product to the public (non-participants of the scheme), or are they generated from other investors participating in the scheme?

If it's not a pyramid scheme, you might want to update your blog because how it's described now is the textbook definition of a pyramid scheme.

The average rate for MW scale operations is $0.03-0.05/kWh.

We should wait until they say they intend to do that before getting out the pitchforks.


I think this is exactly it. Law Enforcement Agencies will pay someone to analyze the blockchain and track down criminals with or without Bitfury.
I'd wager that there are already companies doing exactly this sort of tracking while staying completely under the radar (creating the illusion that anonymity services/protocols are not urgently needed).
And I'd much rather the company doing the tracking be Bitfury, who has been honest and transparent since their inception, than some company we know nothing about.

So even though they share the address of 49dollarmontanaregisteredagent down to the suite number, they're not affiliated because Poloniex said so?
@_date: 2016-03-22 23:13:23
Where did you get that idea from?
Nodecounter uses Bitnodes API and they do not count nodes by the number of datacenters. If you go to classic-cloud.net you will see ~800 classic nodes counted by Bitnodes which are hosted in 6 datacenters.

I see gambling, pyramid/ponzi schemes, and a bunch of things that seem to be created just because it's possible.
I've been patiently waiting for around two years now and I still haven't found a problem that smart contracts/trustless computing solves.
@_date: 2016-03-08 19:56:36
Poloniex is about as shady and unprofessional as exchanges get.
Read this post I made about them: 
@_date: 2016-03-22 23:19:32
Why not count all 800 nodes controlled by classic-cloud.net as one node?
@_date: 2016-03-22 19:43:40
No, they both still count them.

Gavin, are you aware that Marshall Long has commit access for Bitcoin Classic?
This is the guy who led the initial development of Josh Garzas Paycoin. And while they just copied Peercoin and changed a few lines of code, they still managed to catastrophically break the coin forcing it to be shut down for several days.
I hope you will be checking their code very carefully.

Do you think confirmation in 10 minutes is any less ridiculous? If it's not instant, it's not going to work for retail.
If a merchant wants instant transactions they can use offchain solutions like Coinbase or the lightning network(when/if it arrives).
@_date: 2016-03-02 18:01:30
No it doesn't.
If a buyer insists on sending btc on-chain, but wants their transaction accepted with zero confirmations, they can simply send a non-RBF transaction.
The seller will know the transaction is not RBF and can treat it just like they did before RBF was implemented.

There are many more gold nuggets between these two clowns in the leaked emails.

30% of Bitcoin transactions are coming from the most buggy and insecure wallet still in use?
Got a source for that?
@_date: 2016-03-02 18:13:24
That would only be true if RBF transactions weren't labelled as RBF transactions.
The beauty of opt-in RBF is that you can still have 0-conf transactions by simply not using RBF.

ASICMiner didn't receive their first batch of assembled boards until 2 days after Jeff Garzik received his Avalon ASIC.
@_date: 2016-06-09 00:09:22
While Canaan-creative is the actual name of the company, pretty much everyone (including people within the company) just refers to them as Avalon.
And they were the first to deliver ASIC miners.

(Disclaimer: Conspiracy theory)
It seems likely to me that many Classic supporters are actually Ethereum supporters who only want Classic because it would delay SegWit, thus delaying sidechains that would directly compete with Ethereum. As soon as there are smart contracts on the Bitcoin network, nobody will use a 99% premined and heavily manipulated altcoin.

Anyone got a source for this claim?

Why do we need 2mb blocks before a SW softfork?

Haven't you ever heard correlation does not equal causation?
If you made that same chart for 2014 you would be convinced that more transactions equals a lower bitcoin price.

This is literally the definition of a pyramid scheme.

A pyramid scheme?

Here's a post I made with some more info on Marshall.
I originally posted this on r/btc but it was immediately censored.

I don't think you understand what a pyramid scheme is. Here's the textbook definition:


Apple does not pay investors using funds raised from new investors.
@_date: 2016-05-19 06:16:36
Nobody from Blockstream has control over Bitcoin Core. They can only submit pull requests like everyone else.
They received such a large amount of funding for the same reason their proposals so often get merged. They're talented coders/cryptographers.

Which other subs?
Because the only other Bitcoin subreddit I know of that has more than a handful of active users is which is far more toxic than this sub and has basically been nothing but hate spewing, baseless conspiracy theories, and altcoin promoting for several months now.
@_date: 2016-05-21 17:06:18


You should probably avoid fabricating history when you're calling people out on their lies.
Anyone who has been using bitcoin for more than a few months knows that zero/miniscule fee transactions have always been slow and unpredictable.
Here's some data from 3 years ago that shows exactly that:

My experience on is quite a bit different.
I have had several non-rulebreaking comments deleted by the mods without explanation, required to get manual approval when posting links/creating discussions, and was autobanned because of 3 heavily downvoted comments[[1]]( without explanation. Only after a while of receiving no up/downvotes I logged out to see if I was shadowbanned and sure enough I was. 
I contacted the mods and told me it was an "antispam" feature and that he would manually approve my comments. That was fine until they decided to stop manually approving my comments. When I asked if they could approve a (clearly not spam) comment they said the automoderator is working as intended and my comments will not be unhidden. Here's a screenshot of those conversations: 
@_date: 2016-07-17 19:18:49
You misunderstood. Only the automoderator ban was related to comment karma. 
Here is the list of ways I've been censored on * Automoderator banned (because -50 karma)
* Required manual approval on new links/discussions (even with positive karma)
* Comments selectively deleted by mods without explanation (as you say happens here)
* Rate limited to 1 comment per 10 minutes max (even with positive karma)
At least makes it clear what is and isn't allowed, contrary to which is removing comments that are not against the rules and allowing their users to censor opinions that go against the grain via mass downvotes.
@_date: 2016-07-17 07:59:07
I was actually brought down to below -50 karma because of 3 unpopular comments[[1]](
They then decided to stop manually approving my comments (which were clearly not spam/abusive/rule breaking) after this conversation: 
@_date: 2016-07-17 19:10:36


I honestly don't think he means well. His post history makes it obvious to me that he only "bought" the subreddit to use as an advertising platform. Just about all of the links he posts are to a service he owns or his own twitter/forum. 
I don't think he really cares much about censorship or the blocksize debate and only uses it to create a furthur divide between and to ensure his free advertising platform stays active.
