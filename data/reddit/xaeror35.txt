people panicking checking their Gox losses!

550 BTC??? How did you amass such an amount? I would assume through trading since you held it all on a market?
@_date: 2014-02-18 04:16:09
I cant send it again because the BTC is no longer in my wallet!
@_date: 2014-03-12 13:56:44
What do you think? Should bitcoin processors have such a stance? Seems this is a legit business. I understand processors wouldn't want black market business, but in reality sporting goods stores and even Walmart would be limited in using Bitcoin if this were to stick.

Maybe we should all go close our Chase accounts and send them a message.

I think the big bubble recently was speculation and it hitting big media. Then the MTGOX thing happened and people ran for the hills. Now that everything has settled, I think more people have taken a second look and basically said: 
"Wow it is finally easy and cheap to send money to anyone in the world. "

I LOLed

Can you still buy BTC on MtGox? Seems like a massive arbitrage opportunity if you can.. of course there is risk involved
@_date: 2014-02-23 15:09:51
It seems all of this is so the government can track you and tax you.. No other reason really. Bitcoin is dead if this is the case since it goes against everything the digital currency stands for. There is basically no incentive to use bitcoin at that point.

Bitcoin is something alot of people are watching, but it is not obvious what is going to happen with it. People are buying it and holding hoping to get rich somehow. 
Dogecoin people are actually using. I would not be surprised one bit if it actually becomes the standard. 
Don't be arrogant.

I told my dad to start looking into bitcoin because it is the future... First Google search he pulled up said "Bitcoin crashes 40%" or something like that.. yeah he NOPE'd right out of that and has not looked back. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 00:50:00
This was my thoughts exactly
@_date: 2014-02-27 19:25:11
Is there anyway to void those transactions so he cant use what he stole?
@_date: 2014-02-18 02:39:14
Yes, I said that above. blockchain shows no transaction taking place.
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:39:27
Isnt that what ASICs are?

Not many people are actually using BTC either, so that is a bad argument. imgur was started for Reddit and now look at it. 
Obviously nobody can predict the future, but getting people excited about using a currency is a HUGE step in the right direction, even if it is stupid tipping each other's comments.
@_date: 2014-04-11 13:26:24
A big difference now is the IRS ruling. It is complete bullshit and makes using bitcoin very very tedious if you want to stay in the confines of the law.

I fucking hope so. I could use a new house. 
@_date: 2014-10-01 15:03:44
Fuck Comcast. Am i right?

So what did they announce? 
@_date: 2014-05-05 14:20:46
Don't know why you are getting downvoted. It is the truth. Where is the outraged over the 200+ girls abducted? Nobody cares. It is unfortunate. 
@_date: 2014-10-19 14:10:51
LOL are you serious? Still 200% too much
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:04:48
definitely no recruiting would be happening...
@_date: 2015-04-15 03:11:54
The exponential growth to 1k$ was very very bad for BTC. The resulting crash scared millions of potential users away. Not to mention all the hacks, scams, stolen coins, etc.. Things just do not look very bright. At this point you have to be borderline crazy to hold a lot of funds in the form of BTC.
I was a believer, but I have completely pulled out at this point.
@_date: 2015-04-05 02:29:35
LOL OK.

There is no revolution, that's why.
