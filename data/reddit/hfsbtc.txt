Do you need someone to code the UI or someone to code the backend (or both) ? (i.e. are you looking for a frontend dev or a backend dev ?)

I reviewed the code : it's ugly, full of bad practices, and very unsafe.
Author badly needs to learn to program for real.

Linux is not easy to use. Windows and Mac OS aren't either. Or are they all easy to use ?
There's no point in discussing this. Linux is not a desktop environment, and all mainstream desktop environments¹ are exactly equally difficult to use. If you really think that using a Linux system is hard, burn a live Ubuntu CD and try it. It's not less intuitive for windows user than suddenly switching to Mac, same for Mac lifelong user switching to Windows, etc etc
¹ Windows, Gnome, Mac OS X, Unity, KDE, ...

On the paper, it looks convincing. But the facts tell me jrandom and Satoshi are not the same person.
1. jrandom looks like a proficient programmer, Satoshi was clearly not.
2. jrandom was using and programming on Linux, Satoshi is a Windows user. (If jrandom was a Windows user and Satoshi a Linux user, this would not prove anything. But the other way around, I don't see how/why jrandom would have suddenly decided to go away from Linux and start programming with Microsoft Visual C++. Does not make sense.)

I think you'll have to prove that  is *not provably fair* OR *not off-blockchain* OR *wasn't launched before Dice64*.
If you succeed in proving one of these three points, your claim *may be* correct.

Nice work! Unrelated feedback : you're making us load 512KB of JS. That's an awful lot.
80% of these are not even used on the page. Please clean them up. :)

My kantonalbank lets met do this in one step. I guess it's cheaper. I think there's no charge for sending EUR from a CHF account at my bank. I said "might be cheaper" because I didn't do any calculation. ;)

You might want to take a close look at RetroShare. It's pretty much what you describe here.
Very secure, works great, etc.

Saying that's not him. The comment saying they're the same person is mine. I was kidding.
@_date: 2013-06-10 14:56:21
Sure. Let's say jrandom isn't a proficient programmer and had some better programmer do all the heavy work. Then if Satoshi was a proficient programmer but hired some less capable programmer do the work on bitcoin, they cannot be the same person ! Right ?

My sample pool is probably as small as yours (10-15ppl), but I observed the exact same thing as you.

- What strategy is this tool using ?
- In which file is it implemented ?
- Windows user, I advise you not to run this untrusted exe file.

SEPA to gox might be cheaper. I used both options from switzerland. BOth worked great.

This is good news IMO. I really like the bitcoin community as it is : with some place for small actors to develop their own ASICs. It's so much more exciting this way.
I wouldn't really like bitcoin without all these great promises of great chips incoming, stock exchanges with cheap shares from motivated companies... Just imagine if every miner had the exact same hardware, produced by such a big industry actor as AMD... wouldn't it be boring ?

1. I bought a lot during the IPO, at 0.0005, now worth 0.0008. That was an easy 60% profit.
2. Now that AMC is mining, my total first div will be over 0.1BTC

Sorry, I made this comment and it was meant as a joke.

He probably meant R&amp;D&amp;D and development.
Maybe we should ask him about the costs of R&amp;D and development for ATM machines.

Wikipedia says 10⁸⁰ atoms in the visible universe. 2²⁵⁶ keys.
2^256 ~= 0.0012 × the number of atoms in the visible universe (~= 10^80)

Sorry but it does not add up. Which great programmer + Linux user + has invented and implemented i2p would suddenly start a new disruptive + awesome + innovative project AND decide to go with VC++ AND produce somewhat crappy code ?
So you worked all your life on Linux in academia. Would you really start a new project on VC++ and widely publish crappy code because, you know, change happens, and after all people out there should just think "oh he must be a good programmer, he's merely experimenting with VC++ more than he's inventing Bitcoin".
