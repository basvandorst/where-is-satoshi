Even if there is truth in these statements, they are horrible arguments.  They sound like conspiracy theories. There is no way to prove his motives, but there are ways to prove why he is wrong. Focus on the the latter, it is much more positive.

Well apparently Visa ISN'T working that well if the vendor stands to lose all of that money.  Nice thing about BTC being open source and decentralized is that we will have much more developments then VISA will ever have.

Exactly! 
These morons talking about it on all the news channels and putting it on the front pages of their magazines and websites are idiots, nobody is interested!  
All of the investors from the previous crashes that came back into the market because they saw the price rising again, they will for sure not come back a third or fourth time. 
All these idiot investors funding blockchain companies, fucking dummies, blockchain is just a buzzword.  
All these moron executives from Fortune 500 companies now joining blockchain companies.  Stupid idiots, nobody is interested that dead technology!
Public interest has faded. Duh

If you refer to them as Bitcoin because it's easier, what would you refer to a full Bitcoin as?
