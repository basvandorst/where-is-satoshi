All commodities have value - as the Civ IV quote goes, 'Everything is worth what it's purchaser will pay for it'. All mainstream economists also agree with your second point, so your argument in favour of Austrians is that they are tautologically correct and therefore redundant. And that's even ignoring the main argument which is that they can't produce any predictive models and give us nothing to test, meaning they are unscientific.
The Keynesian view is that money is incredibly important - hence sticky prices/wages - and that both fiscal and monetary policy should be used as tools by policy makers to correct for market failure and promote macroeconomic stability.


I notice that this has not happened yet, despite decade's worth of predictions from the very few Austrians.

The real puzzle is why you are lambasting as unscientific for *not* adopting an approach (Austrian Economics) which is by definition unscientific.


This is not a criticism which holds a large amount of water when coming from an Austrian Economist.


Krugman is about as mainstream as vanilla ice cream.


So peer review is useful, but only when it confirms the biases you already hold.
You are not in any kind of position to lecture people on being "unscientific", let alone economics.

Go right ahead. I'm not stopping you from diving into that.


The real science (notice the lack of sarcastic quotation marks) is one which follows the scientific method. Mainstream economics as a method strives for this by testing social behaviour with empirics and against falsifiable hypotheses using models. Praxeology, again by definition, does not do this.


Of course. This is why that isn't an argument against mainstream economics.


First you link a Wikipedia article about a fallacy (incidentally, both incorrectly and fallaciously ), then you pull out a dictionary? Man, you're really precious, huh?
I also notice you don't even attempt to address that you have double standards concerning evidence and peer review. 0/10, see me after class.

Is this actually a ploy to acquire thousands of DOGE?

[It's a long way of saying that]( It's not particularly nice.

Iran is doing it to evade crippling sanctions - any of the traders in Iranian bazaars will tell you that they're absolutely starved of dollars.
The Russia-China deal is a sign of Russian weakness, and that China has the economic muscle to be able to turn the screws.

You do realise the unequal access to Bitcoin is one of its (many) fatal structural problems, right?
@_date: 2013-12-20 15:30:27
...And what if BTC tanks against the the Dollar?

Keynesian's don't always want more government involvement in the economy. For example Krugman was a fierce critic of the Bush Administration's fiscal policies as being over-expansionary.


Because it's pseudoscientific drivel.

Mortal men shouldn't be able to withstand such intense levels of cognitive dissonance.

Please, enlighten us with these 'hundreds' and share them for us. Where are the supermarket chains that will accept Bitcoins for groceries? Who gets their wages paid in Bitcoin? Does any utility company accept Bitcoins as valid payment for heat, light and water? Why can't I pay my landlord in internet money?
@_date: 2013-12-20 15:54:32
I love that this is what counts on as a valid response to someone pointing out that large firms will lose money if they adopt Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-24 18:05:24
Uh, yeah, he won it because he essentially invented New Trade Theory.  


I'm going to cut the crap from now on and start using this when talking to Bitcoin proponents. I've had enough of 'M-M-MUH PARADIGM' and it is enraging seeing unscientific garbage passed off as economics by @_date: 2013-12-27 23:29:01
They didn't put any money on the line. There was almost no risk for them. The price of Bitcoins could increase by a penny and they'd triple their gambling wins. I would begrudge Jobs if he'd been a lazy hack who'd done absolutely nothing productive with his 'investment'.

Most Bitcoins belong to the earlier adopters, and most of those coins will never see widespread circulation.

Since it seems you're unfamiliar with the concept of 'the exception which proves the rule', let me put it like this. Do you pay for all of your groceries, rent, bills, taxes with Bitcoin that you are paid in by your employer?
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:13:23
Who's forcing anybody's will on anyone? I'm just pointing out that if Amazon were to adopt Bitcoin, they would lose lots of money. It's not my fault if this is so undeniable that proponents of Bitcoin like you simply can't come up with an answer to this rather basic problem which precludes wide-spread adoption.
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:59:47
You're doing God's work son.
@_date: 2013-12-21 15:04:37
I'll take that as a 'No' then. I also notice you've been unable to find these 'hundreds' of landlords who will accept my rent money in Bitcoin I asked for.
Quoting you directly:


Which obviously implies you believe that Bitcoin will be a significant competitor to the dollar which we will use in every day life. So either the whole conversation we've had is that you were defending a position you don't actually hold, or you're attempting to backpedal at a furious pace.
