Excellent work with this kraken review. I would add some more info on Kraken's audit (proof of cold storage). They're one of this only cryptocurrency exchanges to have carried this out afaik. 
The big issue i have with Kraken is that they have consistent downtime when price fluctuates. Yes, Kraken is safe and has some of the best security practices of all the exchanges, but when I can no longer trade and the price is booming/crashing... i get real frustrated.

I like that you went ahead and introduced the founders during this review of Kraken. So many exchange operators seek all happy behind their walls of anonymity. If we the users have to send in all our passport info ect, why can't they at least show their faces once in a while!


It's interesting that there are tonnes of bitcoin exchange CEOs with degrees in non-tech subjects. Shapeshift's Erik Vorhees is another great example.

thank you. Kraken only have bank transfers available for depositing and withdrawing. They have the cheapest fees out there.

Lots of alternatives to [buy &amp; sell btc with paypal]( Lookout for the "PayPal" symbol in the table column - i think there's a least 4 major sites you can use.

I've addressed this question above: there are at least [four Coinbase alternatives]( that let you buy btc with card, cash, paypal, and bank transfer

Yeah I do agree with your point on Localbitcoins.. its far easier to buy than set yourself up as a seller on their platform. Some sellers there do it as a full time job! Not too sure about xcoins but they do sell btc for paypal
