Until we are all driving electric cars that are charged by our solar roofs, stfu about \[Insert Any Wasteful activity I Like\] using too much energy.

How is it not a bitcoin issue? Again, bitcoin uses lots of power. Power generates greenhouse emissions. Greenhouse emissions cause climate change.
And the vast majority of miners are in China, which mostly uses  cheap coal plants. Bitcoin miners have no insentive to use green energy whatsoever.

Wars could still be financed even post bitcoin.
In fact, it might make it worse because you could see sanctioned countries funding wars via mining or selling materials via untraceable deals. See NK.

This is such a lazy, poorly thought out whatabout response.  Lets try making a madlib out of your "conclusion" to demonstrate how childish it is. 
If [food poisoning] still exists in the absence of [Chipotle] then it isn't a [Chipotle] problem.  
If [pollution] still exists in the absence of [Exxon] then it isn't a [Exxon] problem.  
If [racism] still exists in the absence of [the kkk] then it isn't a [kkk] problem.  
If [police shootings] still exists in the absence of [Detroit PD] then it isn't a [Detroit PD] problem.  
My kids understand that just because another kid in her class is demonstrating bad behavior, it doesnt mean that she gets to do the same thing without consequence or responsibility.

Do you have a point here?  Of course they arent required to use coal.  Nobody is, yet coal exists as the worlds primary power source.  Again...Facts.  The vast majority of bitcoin miners are in China.  They use coal.  It doesnt matter that they dont have to be there, it just matters that they are.


So we should just ignore ALL polluting industries because other industries do it too?  Honestly, whataboutism is the poorest, most lazy argument available.  Try harder, this is embarrassing.  We can just whatabout ourselves into climate change because somewhere, some industry is also bad.


Now you're just being dense.  Bitcoin users are in china-&gt; China uses coal-&gt;  Global Warming.  It's like 3 steps dude.  


This is usually coal.  So again.  Coal-&gt;Global Warming.  2 steps to a problem.  You following this yet?
And the whole "well solar will be cheaper some day so problem solved" is childish wishfull thinking.  There are trillions of dollars  invested in coal infrastructure.  **The fact that solar is marginally cheaper in a few years does not mean that everyone will tear down their plants and rebuild it with solar**.  Please read that again and let it sink in.  New generation could be solar, but until all those coal plants close in 50-100 years, our primary power source will be coal.  Even China plans to go no further than 16% renawables by 2020.  They have like half the worlds coal, you should bet on them using it.  Again, a fact - china has no plans to eliminate all coal generation, regardless of price.  Even if solar is cheaper, its still always going to be more expensive that tearing down existing plants and rebuilding them.
Let me say that one more time.  **The fact that solar is marginally cheaper in a few years does not mean that everyone will tear down their plants and rebuild it with solar**.  You clearly do not understand the economics of power generation.   Switching generation platforms isnt something you just do overnight.  It takes decades or more and costs billions to rebuild what you already built with coal.

Is this really that complicated?
If you think climate change is a problem AND you believe that climate change is to a large extent directly proportional to power consumption, then you should also believe that bitcoin’s massive power consumption is a problem.

Is there even a source on the "banking uses 100 terawatts" or did she just make that number up?
And banks do a lot more than moving money from A to B.  There are huge operations in loans, equity operations, derivatives, deal making, etc. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 14:43:25
Except for it literally being true.

If fiat money was replaced by bitcoin, we'd still have militaries.  
@_date: 2018-08-27 14:46:16
So you don't believe global warming is a thing?
@_date: 2018-08-28 16:10:26
Well now you're just rambling. Focus, dude. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 16:51:58
Your response isnt grounded in reality.  Power generation is responsible for 28% of global greenhouse emissions.  That's just a fact.  And coal makes up 40% of that, again a fact.  You dont have to believe it, but it's definitely true. 
Just look at this nuclear idea. First, it takes 10-20 years to permit and build a new nuclear power plant.  And even the richest miners dont have 5 billion in capital they can put on the sidelines for two decades while they finance a plant.  
At the end of the day, there are two ways to reduce our carbon footprint globally.  We either reduce power consumption or move to cleaner production.  The 2nd is going to be a long haul and bitcoin is destructive to the first.   Most bitcoins are mined from cheap chinese coal and they are worth just as much as bitcoins mined from green sources.
