This is trashy pop psychology, plain and simple.

Not disagreeing with you, but can you provide a source for that statistic?
@_date: 2014-10-18 02:32:55
You made my day with this comment.

Same. btctrip is legitimate and went out of their way to make sure my flight went smoothly.
Edit: grammar

Did you buy the car in bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-08-29 18:16:14
Added .04 to the total.
@_date: 2014-11-08 20:41:07
Let's try this thing out.

Great. Thanks in advance for your efforts. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 00:10:47
mathematically, how much more difficult? In big oh notation and in terms of total hashing power?
@_date: 2013-12-27 00:41:06
What is a good difficulty estimate?

History has shown us holding is best, but we really don't know what the future portends for certain. Of course, bitcoins could rise, and technology can deprecate your hardware before you even get it in the mail, but why couldn't it play out in other ways? If bitcoins instead had remained even, and your hardware came out when you asked for it, you could have turned a nice profit.
Also, can we get some hard numbers? How many bitcoins per day does your paperweight generate now? Less than .01? What was the initial cost of investment? Did the manufacturer guarantee a shipping date and not deliver on their promise? Did you do research yourself before buying, and ultimately get screwed by the shipping date?

It's called speculating- it's hardly worse than purchasing stock for instance- and why do you think I'm here asking questions? You guys already saved me hours of research!
@_date: 2013-12-27 00:24:37
I already bought a decent chunk of coins, and I even have a bot executing occasionally profitable trades on btc-e.com. So now I'm researching mining itself, hence my question here. 
Sorry for submitting a naive post but I knew you guys would bring me up to speed faster than most places.

Very helpful! Thanks for the details of your experience and hope butterfly compensates you for it.

Can you please phrase in this in an easily digestible pinky and the brain meme?
@_date: 2013-12-26 10:04:45
If I had to guess it's a literal response type of joke, since .00147 btc is about the cost of 1 light bulb (assume a light bulb cost one dollar, then 1/.00147 ~ 680 which is near the btc /usd conversion rate)
