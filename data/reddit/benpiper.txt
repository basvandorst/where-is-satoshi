Not if, but when. It will happen. The whole thing is worse than gambling.

Net Neutrality appeals to those who love the Internet but have no idea how it works.

We all know who's going to win this one.

Last I checked, Bitcoin price swings are way bigger than gold's.
As an aside, I find it kind of amusing when people downvote raw, undisputed facts.
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:57:09
Marvel or DC?
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:56:32
Regular or decaf?
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:04:15
Bitcoin goes political. It's different groups fighting for control of how Bitcoin works.

If I had that much tied up in an exchange, I guarantee you I'd be having some strange movements.

Appropriate for a fictional TV show to feature a fictional currency.
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:37:05
People who buy gold don't generally google for how to do it. 
People who are searching for a get-rich-quick scheme, on the other hand...
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:56:37
Paper or plastic?
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:55:15


I think this is inevitable.
@_date: 2017-10-31 04:08:02
Lost, yes, but not permanently and provably destroyed.
@_date: 2017-10-28 01:55:41


That's circular reasoning.
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:36:11
You can't live in a bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:03:16
Bitcoin (and blockchain anything) is a fad, and people treat it as an investment that's going to keep going up. But even gold, which has a long history, doesn't go ever upward. It rises and falls, just like crypto. But, unlike crypto, gold can't be destroyed.

I'm siding with the people who know more about economics.
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:40:55
Behold, blockchain's scalability problem.
@_date: 2017-10-27 01:49:23
People will believe anything.
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:52:24
Bitcoin is a bubble.
*places sell order*
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:53:24
Did you have to wait for confirmations before you could eat your taco?
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:04:21


Wait, what?
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:25:31
Fantastic argument. I recant.
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:05:48
Why *would* they accept Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-31 03:16:16
That's optimistic.
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:04:17
These third-party wallets are effectively unregulated bitcoin banks. They could take the crypto and run if they wanted to.
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:14:34
Of course he does: people using PayPal to buy and sell Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:10:06
The laws of physics don't run reality, they describe it. What's the connection between entropy and economics?
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:45:41
@_date: 2017-10-31 03:16:52
You can destroy bitcoin by sending it to an illegal address. You can't destroy gold.
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:08:09
Exactly. "Store of value" is an unfortunate term because it incorrectly implies that a thing has intrinsic economic value.
@_date: 2017-10-28 01:41:39
How exactly will Bitcoin achieve a larger market cap?
@_date: 2017-05-29 20:33:40
That's called paying it forward!
@_date: 2017-05-29 01:50:06
Great, now I'm hungry.
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:29:11
The nature of blockchains is that they're slow.
@_date: 2017-05-29 15:08:15
If they required confirmations he'd still be waiting for the beer.
@_date: 2017-05-31 23:44:05
Miners use bitcoin, hence, miners *are* users. This "us vs. them" narrative is unfounded and divisive.
@_date: 2017-05-29 19:39:30
Independence from what? Did Bitcoin get taken over by some secret operatives? Would love to see a technical argument instead of all the marketing buzzwords.
@_date: 2017-06-17 16:57:58
Ethereum is decentralized now?
@_date: 2017-06-04 01:52:09
Looking forward to the debut of the UASF altcoin
@_date: 2017-06-02 22:00:16
It's a sledgehammer approach of implementing segwit by breaking compatibility with the majority of Bitcoin nodes.
@_date: 2017-06-03 00:48:53
The Great Firewall of China?
@_date: 2017-06-02 04:55:33
No, BIP-148 UASF will probably make it worse.
