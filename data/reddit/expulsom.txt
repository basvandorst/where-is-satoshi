[Nash.io]( is a new non-custidial exchange which requires KYC. You have your own keys on there.

Welcome to crypto.

It’s actually upvoted 11k times.
@_date: 2019-11-21 22:29:42
Welcome! I also entered the cryptospace when I was 18, which is 3 years ago. Good luck!
@_date: 2019-11-22 11:36:11
No. We have been through this many times before.
@_date: 2019-10-12 15:53:57
Sorry I'm not interested.
@_date: 2019-10-12 14:22:04
I actually think it would be profitable to hold BTC during a recession, like gold and silver. But that's just what I think. BTC didn't exist during the previous recession so I guess we'll find out then.
@_date: 2019-10-09 23:17:44
ETF denied, BTC doesn’t seem to care.
@_date: 2019-10-07 12:08:52
Both actually.
@_date: 2019-10-02 15:20:20
Yeah it's a weird combination, that's why I was so surprised with the Venezuela news last week.
@_date: 2019-10-02 21:50:41
I got free $50 bonus from them yesterday for registering on there using pomps code. As soon as I received it I withdrew the BTC because I didn’t trust them.
@_date: 2019-10-14 23:12:57
For real dude? This is an obvious scam.
@_date: 2019-10-01 19:03:25
I think it will be depression instead of recession. And probably a lot of people will flee to BTC but also to gold and silver. But that’s just my opinion. We have to wait and see what will happen during those times.
@_date: 2019-10-01 19:08:16
Thats awesome dude.
@_date: 2019-10-24 09:22:21
Have an adult buy it for you.
@_date: 2019-10-31 08:38:07
Happy birthday Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-10-02 15:41:20
Thanks for the vid!
@_date: 2019-10-01 19:40:30
I wish you the best of luck!

I don't see the problem. I bought some btc for my mom a year ago and put it into a wallet and gave her the private key and a brief instruction how to use it. She understands the risk.
@_date: 2019-10-12 16:12:01
@_date: 2019-06-22 08:30:07
Yes you are wrong to assume that. We simply don’t know what’s going to happen unless you are a time traveler.
@_date: 2019-10-04 18:42:57
Pretty long, like 12 hours or so. Probably because it’s done manually.
@_date: 2019-10-12 14:27:41
Mining isn't profitable where I live.
@_date: 2019-10-12 14:50:06
Yeah okay I understand. That's a different situation. I wouldn't do that either. If people don't understand it they shouldn't hold it. They need to learn how to use it first.
@_date: 2019-06-28 21:07:21
Look up some good tutorials on youtube. I learned quite a lot on there when I came into the space three years ago.
@_date: 2019-06-26 15:50:51
Upvoted ;)
@_date: 2019-10-01 16:38:11
Why buy bitcoin when you have zero knowledge of it? Do some research first. If you did that you probably didn’t have to deal with this problem. Try watching some youtube videos on how to start with bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-23 16:43:29
We don't know.
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:26:29
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:34:48
Congrats dude!
@_date: 2019-06-25 11:11:24
Lets go!
@_date: 2019-06-25 10:00:46
Cool stuff.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:57:52
Yes sir. fasten your seatbelt.

I like how you paused your call to take this screenshot.

What a cunt
@_date: 2019-06-25 20:20:59
He probably buys your btc for 90% of the current price of btc and he sells his btc for +4% of the current btc price.

Oh wow, he drew a line.
@_date: 2018-11-30 17:28:05
For the people who are claiming that the account is hacked, where is the evidence of that claim?
@_date: 2019-09-27 23:28:40
Americans are ignoring this because they don’t want to lose power.
@_date: 2019-09-27 23:43:00
Exactly. American people think nothing can happen to the Dollar but hyperinflation can happen in America too. It’s just a matter of when.
@_date: 2018-12-01 11:03:39
And how would you know that? Lol
