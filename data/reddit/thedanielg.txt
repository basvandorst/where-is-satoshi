I've already broken even, as mentioned above.

Hmmm, would Bitstamp send the money to PayPal?

Would I be able to do it over a browser or at least be quick to set up? I'll only be able to access a friend's PC or Internet Cafe.

So then what would I do with my earnings?

My country dosen't even have 20mb internet. NOT A CHANCE I'll be able to get my new keyboard via btc anytime soon.....

I'll take a look at bitx. Local bitcoins I did not want to use as it requires P2P contact etc, something I want to avoid.

The company that made Hamachi? I'll check it out.

Sorry! I live in South Africa, of all places :(

I'd prefer not to, rather transfer every few days as more of a "pocket money" type system. It's a more constant flow of cash that I'm looking for.

Mining at full speed now. Thanks!

I would not want to give my banking details in. Also knowing my bank, the transaction fees would be high....

I have zadig but I want to use bfg. I think I found my problem: drivers were for cg not bfg so it was mining with my gpu....

Not one to fiddle too much, although I am aware of that option. Have a Raspberry Pi, that's enough Linux for me!
