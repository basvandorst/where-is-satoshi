If it doesn’t there’s an add in on google sheets called crypto finance that may help

Why didn’t you just share a link to the video. Lol

It’ll happen eventually. Shouldn’t be controlling the price movement. As most people say, the delay is a good thing.
@_date: 2018-08-03 13:04:02
Big moves. Moon is coming folks 
@_date: 2018-08-03 19:41:55
Hopefully this will cause the irs to change how capital gains and losses are calculated too. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 01:34:38
The ROI for the year must be incredible now. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 21:22:04
I think  is one of, if not, the best resources to get started. Also go the Nakamoto institute website and read up on some of the articles Pierre Rouchard and Bitstein have up there

Cash app. You can get your paycheck direct deposited 
@_date: 2018-08-09 00:51:10
I’ve told people dollar cost averaging is the best way to get into bitcoin, of course if it fits your investment plan. See the below info graphic 
@_date: 2018-08-09 01:52:00
Get your shitposting out of here

If they sold at all they have to recognize gains/losses in their tax return.

Had the same issue a month ago. Contact customer support and they’ll walk you through it 
@_date: 2018-10-12 19:41:31

Cash app
@_date: 2018-10-12 19:43:56
I think I had to use my debit card rather than a ACH. Try giving that one a try 
@_date: 2019-02-03 16:20:57
Cash app is a much better option than coinbase imo. I love what jack and the team are doing there 
@_date: 2019-02-03 16:18:17
I think it’s because Charlie says he wants confidential transactions on it 
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:35:49

If you’re not in it for the lambos, price is irrelevant. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:35:49
Not long. Just send them a dm on twitter 
@_date: 2018-11-16 21:26:31
How will they ban bitcoin? I don’t see how that’s possible. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:57:53
It can go to 0.01. But I doubt the whales will let that happen. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 14:08:38
Why is holding stupid? I don’t think there is anything wrong with holding. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:38:17
I doubt we’ll see sub 3k. I think if we do banks will be buying it up and beginning adopting it as a SOV/MOE

If you’re price is denominated in fiat, that’s correct. If they denominate the good in BTC, it’s not changing. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:59:36
Never said there was a reason for either. I’m reminding people that NOTHING has changed with BTC and dollar cost averaging in whatever you can afford makes sense. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:03:50
Certainly is. Everyone has a USD price they will sell at. 
But looking at the prices hourly or daily isn’t necessary. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:58:49
No. You should post on things other than price. That’s what r/bitcoinmarkets is for
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:46:55
You can go into the debt buying stocks on margin too..... 
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:01:36
That’s a narrow sighted view when LN has increased its capacity to 300 BTC and is still growing. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:35:09
Consider switching to cash app. Same day withdraws, there’s no “fee”, but you pay a little bit extra in the spread. You can also get direct deposit on there 
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:05:16
Absolutely. My statement was more of a general one as I doubt the majority of the people posting the pictures of the prices are mining btc. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:36:30
Don’t celebrate the price surge. Could easily reverse back down
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:14:33
i figured that was the case. just wasnt sure due to the increase channels in LN, thought maybe theyd use it.
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:30:56
Make sure you get your BTC off the exchanges into a hardware wallet! 
@_date: 2019-01-27 16:17:27
It’s not that crazy of a question given the Amount of people who bought in Dec 2017 and sold in January at a loss. Created a nice carryforward for the individuals 
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:29:30
1 BTC = 1 BTC though.... 
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:54:59
If you’re a hodler of last resort, you don’t need stop losses. 
@_date: 2019-01-27 16:15:01
Alec stop promoting your twitter account 
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:59:54
Just don’t ever mention how much BTC you own to the people who ask questions. Gotta be careful  of bad actors

Until it becomes a MOE and contracts defined in satoshis this will happen lol. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 00:16:21
Is Bakkt using LN or do they have their own scaling mechanism 
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:59:17
Salty about what? 
@_date: 2019-01-22 02:57:19
It says coinbase pro is one of the safest. 
Also why do you keep your coins on the exchange to begin with. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 11:19:49
Hope they don’t catch him. I want to see a grown man eat his own dick. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 13:38:53
While there is no use for blockchain, there is a strong use case for bitcoin. I don’t know why people don’t understand blockchain =/= bitcoin 
@_date: 2019-01-22 02:59:10
Just curious does PayPal’s numbers include Venmo?
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:00:29
@_date: 2018-07-12 23:11:09
Average in. Do like 200 a pay check. Or how ever much you want to purchase 
@_date: 2018-07-21 23:19:23
You can test your recovery seed to make sure it is right if you still have the original device. 
@_date: 2018-07-21 21:21:41
I rather have a slightly higher basis on cash app and take my private keys to hardware wallets or cold storage 
@_date: 2018-07-21 23:35:05
I wouldnt put my phone number in it. 
@_date: 2018-07-21 23:08:14
You should absolutely update it 
@_date: 2018-07-21 17:49:18
I don’t think it’s possible to take your bitcoin and other crypto off Robinhood, which is a big downfall of the service 
@_date: 2018-07-22 03:19:52
Doubt it. I think alts while fly as well just because common folk think they can 10 or 100x like BTC. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 03:28:06
Imo, Institutions are going to go after  BTC and ETH. The alts are going to get pumped by normal people. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 03:40:52
It’ll bring more money into the space no matter what. If GS or JPM start accumulating BTC, people will feel more comfortable buying it. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 20:48:25
I have buys on the way up from 5000 to 17500  and buys all the way down. Dollar cost averaging my way to full bitcoins 
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:13:25
It will have a high USD/EUR value as hyperbitcoinization and those currencies devalue 
@_date: 2018-12-28 14:19:07
I buy each pay periods regardless of the price. So on the 15/30 of every month
@_date: 2018-12-05 11:40:10
Question: why did you keep that much BTC on an exchange? 
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:53:04
do i need to be using LND? as i mentioned in the post im using eclair for it. i tried connecting and got an error. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 16:17:11
What are you talking about?
