On first glance, it sounds scammy and trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist. I only paid attention because I was interested in the computer science aspect of it (the claims seemed impossible). Once I dug in more I "got it".
People won't need to know what bitcoin is once it's "ready". There needs to be a killer app, and that will be microtransactions. Some day years from now, the Lightning network will be up &amp; running and integrated into browsers. Web ads will die and you'll pay-per-article, some small fraction of a penny, instead of subscribing to every single site you want to read articles on. People will top up their browser, say $10 every few months, and forget about it. It'll seem transparent. It'll make sense, then : an international money to buy premium web content with.
Then years later the "buy stuff in real life with bitcoin" part will take hold, because everyone will have a small balance already, it'll be a natural progression.
But as for today, I can't see the average person using it. It's not friendly enough and there's not enough reason to learn it today. Too much explaining needed, it sounds geeky and strange. It sets off people's "scam alert" sense and/or just too complicated for little reward.

20 MB blocks mean transferring and storing 87.6 gigabytes a month. That's just to download once, not counting uploading to others, and assuming every byte you download is actually valid.
With many ISPs putting a cap of 100 to 200 GB/month on their customers, it will turn away many home users from running a full node. My internet speed (and the cap) hasn't changed for years and I think it is unlikely to change any time soon.
Also, it would be cheap to flood the bitcoin network with millions of transactions that pay the minimum fee and bloat the blockchain. Once you stick 87 GB of crap on the blockchain, it's there forever.
I don't understand why we're not talking about 2MB blocks. Why not baby steps?

What are your thoughts about the fact that most ISPs have data caps, and haven't increased those caps for quite a while? (no reason to think they'll reduce the caps anytime soon, either)?
In fact, Comcast (largest ISP in US) is now going to charge for bandwidth over the cap (whereas before they quietly let it slide in most cases)

The technology doesn't even exist yet, so how can you say that?
The closest thing is the Apple App store, where you often pay $0.99 for software (unheard of 20 years ago) and that is a wild success. Take that, make it platform agnostic, and for any kind of content, and I think it will be huge.
Also, there's lots of non-free content (new york times, the economist, etc) behind paywalls I just skip, because I don't want to subscribe for 1 year. Hell, just making a free account is enough to make me hit the back button. If I could just click it for a few cents I would.

In theory I can run 100 VMwares on a single PC with 1 hard drive. It could do what you are saying.  There is no way to prove "100 computers" are not just 1 computer pretending to be many.

I can think of a convoluted way to prove most of a download. Bob sends Alice chunk  of data. Alice knows what the checksum is supposed to be for that chunk, and if it's valid, she sends a payment to Bob, publicly proving she got it.
Bob then sends chunk  etc.
Alice could screw Bob out of the payment for the last Chunk.  Also, there's other issues why I don't think this would work.
The real issue is, you can never know that your data is stored on more then 1 computer (see my other posts in this thread). And you can't count on them sending it to you when you want it.
There really needs to be a reputation thing for this to work right. The devs of Storj haven't released any details, I don't think they have solved any of this yet (if they did it would be as big as satoshi coming up with proof-of-work blockchain, a BIG deal)

I didn't want to spend too much time talking about the specifics of this idea, but you're right, if it was just a replacement for existing Bittorrent, who cares?
But I'm talking about something more - you serve pieces of files that you don't even care about - you're just doing it to earn bitcoin.
So someone could write a program, say a distributed censorship proof message board, and the data is out in the "network". And you could say "I'll run the server program, which downloads and re-serves data automatically, to earn myself a little money each month".
You don't even care about it, or know what the data is, it's all encrypted so you don't have to worry about what you're serving (TOR sets a precedent here?).
So suddenly you could have a p2p web or p2p anything because people are serving stuff for micro payments.
People might be willing to pay small amounts for a community run network that isn't paid for by ads, and is censorship proof, etc.
Imagine a p2p "archive of the internet", a p2p facebook alternative, etc. Before anyone could write these things you need a simple generic "p2p data network". Existing bittorrent is just people doing it out the kindness of their hearts, but that's not good enough for some things.

Did you really think the price was going to go straight up, without ever "crashing" again? Historically it has crashed twice, BIG time. This is crash  not really unexpected. The market is so small, and it is so early, that there are going to be many more cycles of "crash -&gt; up! -&gt; crash". You could try to time these bubbles, or just hold long term &amp; not think about it.
If that freaks you out, then you SHOULD cash out now, but you may regret it 10 years from now.

I know this thread is old now, but I'm curious on your thoughts on spending the money as you did on video cards Vs. just buying BTC outright with cash (perhaps then trading it for some alt coins like doge) and holding.

I'd seen a description of  ["Micropayment channels"]( before, but since that is only between you and another party, it didn't seem too interesting to me.
But this "hub and spoke" concept seems really exciting (and obvious, now!): with someone acting as a hub, you could connect many parties together and do off-blockchain micropayments between them. You don't even have to trust the hub.
This seems like a Really Big Deal(tm), as lack of micro payments is one of the biggest technical complaints against bitcoin I've heard.

The idea that someone other then the government would issue and secure a currency sounds batshit. But at one time, FedEx sounded a little crazy too ("delivering things is the government's job!")
" The concept for what became Federal Express came to Fred Smith while he was studying at Yale University. For a class there, he submitted a paper which argued that in modern technological society time meant money more than ever before [...] **He submitted the paper to the professor teaching the course, who supposedly gave the paper the grade of "C".** "
...I don't think anyone today would say the Postal System does a better job than FedEx/UPS.  US Mail is  "good enough" but there's room for competition .
That's what I think people will *slowly* realize about Bitcoin: no one's trying to replace the dollar, but it can be done BETTER, and the systems can coexist. It's NOT batshit crazy, it's no different then using FedEx for an important document that needs to arrive tomorrow, vs. sending a card to Grandma.  Bitcoin is just a better way to send "value" over the internet - But it's still going to take a while for everyone to wrap their heads around the idea. I'm amazed it's over $100 so "soon", let alone $600 !

Without getting too complicated, explain that before 2009 nobody thought something like bitcoin could exist. People always say "anyone could make fake money", they don't realize that a fair (decentralized) "fake money" was thought to be impossible, and that's why you didn't see this in the AOL days. It really *is* a recent breakthrough that sort of stunned/mystified a lot of techies.
Altcoins can be summed up: they took the code to bitcoin and changed a few lines. NO ONE* has yet written anything comparable to bitcoin since it came out - there is no "Pepsi" to bitcoin's "Coke", there's just Coke and some people have also taken Coke and added a lime to it. They're just lame copies.

No one is going to do a double spend attack for a 2 page article. Also, you'd have some sort of micropayment network on top of bitcoin that would handle this, which might involve something like Changetip where you keep a small amount ($5) and it makes micropayments for you off-the-blockchain.
@_date: 2014-04-11 08:29:36
I want to say yes, but IPs are probably not as useful as they appear. In the botnet scenario I suggested, the 100 machines could all have different IP's, but they all keep the data on 1 machine (and forward it to you).  So IP's dont mean anything in that scenario. And the other way around - I know there are entire countries that run off 1 single IP, so they'd be punished for not having a unique IP.
It's tricky, I don't know how important my objections are because I don't know what StorJ's payment model is. I don't think they've explained it.
But I do know, there is no way to prove how redundant/spread out my data is... Or if I'll even get it all when I want to download it. It's a big "..PROBABLY.." for me.
So I can't see how this is better then just buying some space on amazon and using Duplicati   (great program BTW)
@_date: 2014-12-19 05:52:30
Someone would act as a hub and everyone would make 2-way connections to him. I lock $10 worth of BTC as a "send channel" to the hub, and the hub does the same back to me. Total 4 transactions made on the blockchain.
Then everyone else does the same with the hub...
Now I can make payments to anyone else connected to the hub without having to set up a connection to them. I say, "Hey hub, here's 1 penny, give it to Joe" and the hub just does that on his channel he has with Joe.
I have to trust the hub to pass my micropayments along but my recipients can tell me that they got it. Worst case I have 1 micropayment stolen by the hub and I stop using it.
So imagine I want to pay or receive microtransactions with 20 people today - without a hub that's 20 to 40 blockchain transactions to set those up, but with the hub, it's just 2 per person.
(At least that is how I am reading this, I could be wrong)

There is no way to prove that these nodes aren't all just the same computer (with 1 hard drive). I can't know if my data is stored redundantly across many different machines. There's no way to know if Node == Machine.
I would pay more for 2 people to store my data, vs 1 guy storing it twice, even though the same resources are used. But there's no way to know what's going on in the network. In fact, the entire network could be 1 guy (with a huge hard drive) for all I know! Your solution makes it less profitable for someone to impersonate many nodes, but I still think they'd do it anyway. It's still cheaper to store 1TB on 1 machine vs 500GB x 2 machines, so they'll do it.

"But who cares the system gets exactly the same resources from the 1 computer or the 100 so it does not matter."
Well, I care, because hard drives die all the time, and it is way more valuable to have my data stored on 100 hard drives vs. just 1.
If you knew your data was spread all over the world, on 100 different computers, isn't that worth paying more money?  vs. just stored on 1 computer?
But under StorJ (as I understand it) all I can prove is, 1 computer has my data. I can't know that more then 1 has it. Also I have no way to know if he'll send me it when I want it. There's a lot of trust involved...

I didn't describe my idea in much detail, but 1) you'd be serving encrypted files and you'd (like with TOR) have no idea what you're serving 2) they can already cream themselves over existing Bittorrent

the bottom line - I want to store my data 100 times:
it is better to have "my data" stored on 100 PCs vs 1 PC,
but it is cheaper to store "my data" on 1 PC vs 100 PCs
yes, with separete keys, it's the exact same bandwidth + storage requirements in both scenarios, but they ARE different. I would rather spread to 100 PC's vs 1 PC with a huge disk.
If StorJ pays per node, then there will always be a financial incentive to run as many "fake nodes" per PC as possible

Why can't someone simply fork Counterparty, but change it so new XCP can always be created (by burning BTC) at any time? No limit. Or, where XCP is created by giving it to the miner who found the bitcoin block that carries a counterparty transaction? Both of these solutions sound way more fair, and there's nothing to stop anyone from doing it. Forking bitcoin is hard - for it to be as secured, you have to replace the hash power, too - but forking Counterparty should be easy, because it sits on top of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-11 06:49:04
I am simply saying: it is 100 times more valuable to me (I would pay 100x more) to have a piece of data on 100 different hard drives, vs. just one. That way, even if 50 failed, or went offline, I would still have another 50 holding my stuff.
But there is NO way to prove more then 1 computer has my data. If you've thought of a method of proving this, you should post it here, you'll have solved a major issue in computer science, as big as Satoshi figuring out proof-of-work.
So I'm not going to pay any more then I'd pay for 1 computer to host my data, because that's all I can ever know has it.
So I can't see how the "get paid to store people's data" works. If I stick 100 computers onto the network, you'd think I'd get paid more then if I stuck 1 onto the network.
But there is no way to prove I've added any redundancy at all, maybe I just added 100x more disk space. That is WAY different then adding 100 computers to the network. It's way, way less valuable. But we can't know the difference, so we can't pay more for one scenario vs the other.
So the entire StorJ network could be 1 dude with 100TB attached to a single computer, or it could be 100 people with 1TB, there is no way to know what is the truth, but one is WAY more valuable then the other.

There need to be more unique uses for it. Right now, using it as a fancy Western Union replacement is not very exciting to most people.
Thing's I'm waiting for:
- games that use tiny amounts of bitcoin as currency (or colored coins/counterparty for in-game objects). Think a Magic: The Gathering clone where you OWN the cards, or an Eve Online style game where the ingame currency are just Satoshis. And imagine this game became as popular as Minecraft or Wow...
- a p2p network where anyone can serve a file for bitcoins. Think Bittorrent KAD/DHT network but with a simple addition of "price". I know about Maidsafe/StorJ but I'm talking about something much simpler that does not try to create it's own altcoin (as they've done). Now all sorts of p2p applications could be built upon this layer...
- More micropayment/tipping things like Changetip. Imagine newspapers that charge 1 bit per article instead of trying to get you to do a yearly subscription - and your browser takes care of it automatically.
I think once there are some cool things you can do with bitcoin that you can't do with [paypal, visa, cash] you'll create a demand for bitcoin that does not exist yet. A lot of these ideas are no-brainers, they just haven't been implemented yet. It could take years. When I first got on the internet, there was no simple "chat program" - there was IRC, but that was complex. Then eventually ICQ came out. In retrospect it seemed obvious, "why isn't there a simple GUI chat program?", but it took a couple of years for someone to actually write it.
I've heard so many interesting ideas for uses of bitcoin that just haven't been programmed yet, it's just a matter of time before someone finally makes that "killer app".
@_date: 2014-04-11 05:30:40


That's why I said "botnet" - you could have 100 nodes that are just infected PCs, that don't store any information. And 1 that does. If you ask any of the 100 for checksum, they (behind the scenes) ask the 1 for the checksum, and pass it back to you. So you think 100 computers are giving you valid checksums, there must be 100 computers storing your information... but in reality it is fake, to collect more income.

Sounds interesting, except there is no explanation on how they've solved all the huge SOCIAL problems that go along with this - I don't think they have.
I can run a botnet and pretend to store 100 copies of your data - but I've only got 1 copy (stored on some poor schmuck's malware infected PC). You're paying me a fee * 100 to keep your data safe, I earn a nice little income.

I guess my point is, with Storj, there is no way for me to know that my 50GB isn't all on a single, malware-infected Windows 98 computer sitting in a janitor's closet somewhere. There's just no way to prove one way or the other that it is or isn't.
To me, that is no better then me just copying my 50GB to an external hard drive.
A big selling point of online storage is, my data is redundant - many copies, spread out all over the network. But I can't see any way to prove that is happening.
I would obviously pay more to have more redundant copies floating around, but since I can't get proof of that, I don't see this idea working...  (without some kind of reputation system)...

I was thinking the same thing. Teenagers are bitcoin's best market - they are less likely to have a bank account, credit card, etc. Being able to exchange bitcoins for Xbox points is makes it attractive to "learn bitcoin" and accept them.

I think when you've been into technology a LONG time, as most slashdoters have, and you hear about something new, you tend to be cynical and think it will join the pile of other dead, "old is new again" things you've watched come and go. It's really easy to pick things apart, and makes you feel superior in a way.
Take the famous comment on the iPod story:  "No wireless. Less space than a nomad. Lame."
Bitcoin DID seem sketchy in 2010, the forums had lots of poor-english Eastern European guys promoting gambling sites... it was easy to dismiss as a "scam". Download and run software on my computer for worthless tokens? No thanks! Even Satoshi's first posts on the Cryptography Mailing list did not generate much buzz.

"The math behind Bitcoin is truly new technology - prior to its 2009 release, computer scientists thought something like Bitcoin was impossible. Its code is a breakthrough discovery which has opened an entire new field of scientific study."
... I'm having trouble coming up with 6 more, but I think this line is really important - too many people have told me, "anyone could have done that (make fake internet money)" - they don't realize that, No, this was an unsolved problem ("two generals problem") and we never saw anything like this before Bitcoin because it wasn't possible until just recently!
Take a look at the bitcoin mailing list - bitcoin has created a whole new vocabulary ("finney attack", "blockchain", etc) and I don't think I'm exaggerating to call it a new field of study.

of course there wouldn't actually be "virtual machines", I'm simply trying to explain to people who have a hard time understanding that Node != Unique Computer. You would write a custom client to the StorJ network (not run a real virtual machine) the StorJ network cannot know the difference.
if you ALREADY run a botnet, with 10,000 unique IP's, and storJ pays Nodes as if they are "unique machines", why wouldn't you try to make as much money as you could?  You could buy 1 Amazon s3 bucket, and program the botnet-nodes to funnel the information from the amazon bucket to the storJ network, to make it look like they're all filled with data. Then, suddenly, every IP address ( "node" ) you can add, the more money you make.... even though the amount of data + bandwidth used is unchanged.  You don't have to worry about running REAL storJ on each botnet computer, maintaining them, etc - just fake it, and get paid the same.

so that's about $2 to issue an asset. Won't people horde their XCP? It would be just as reasonable to pay, say $10 to issue an asset - in other words, I could see the price going to what the market is willing to pay to issue an asset, and XCP could go up 5x - 10x due to that.
The other way of thinking of it, is , XCP is already massively overpriced. BTC would have to go to about $4500 to justify the XCP market cap today (vs. what was burned ...)
Not sure what to think on this one. The overstock thing makes me want to buy some and just take a gamble...

This is why I like Myriadcoin.
It has 5 separate chains - all working simultaneously. So, even if you attacked the scrypt chain (as is being done now to AUR) you would only gain control of 1/5 of the blocks - not enough for a 51% attack.
A big scrypt or SHA256 pool operator cannot simply use his miners to do an attack on MYR. You would have to also convince a lot of people to run the miner software for Qubit, Skein or Groestl - sort of hard to do (but not impossible of course).

That I don't know (and I'm not even 100% sure my understanding on any of this subject is correct). But my guess is, no, you'd have to talk to the recipient at some point (if you cared). But if you were getting a service from them in real-time, and they're suddenly acting as if you didn't pay the previous micro transaction, that would be a good sign that it didn't go through...

since it's an invalid bitcoin address (it's valid, but you can tell nobody has the private key because it would be impossible to generate that), you are throwing your bitcoins away by sending to it.  So you can base an alt coin off this concept: everyone throw away their bitcoins to this address, then we'll distribute the alt-coin to people who did this - it's "fair" because everyone had to "pay" , and now we don't need miners to distribute the coins (sort of). Counterparty does this,  (it's not really a true alt-coin, it makes use of bitcoin's blockchain)... but this chancecoin the OP linked to sounds like a scam who's devs don't know what they are doing
@_date: 2014-12-18 09:34:25
It sounds like Bob has to be online, but I can't think of any scenarios where people want to do micro transactions, and one of them is offline... If you are serving content 1 penny at a time, you are online to serve that content... and if you are consuming content, you are obviously online too.
I guess tipping someone who is offline is one scenario... any others?
If you made the window larger, 1 week instead of 1 day, then the person could claim it in 1 week which sounds like a reasonable time frame...

Curious to see the whitepaper. The paper gives a 404 error, I looked at the google cache version of it and it was very weak on info.
It seems to me, the biggest issue is coming up with some sort of decentralized reputation system.
What happens when I download my backed up data, but I am sent gibberish instead? Or, I decide not to pay after receiving my data?
I can undestand a "proof of backup" - I take a hash of my file at many different, wacky offsets, then ask for hashes made at these offsets every once in a while, to prove "they've" still got my data. But how do I know "they'll" actually send it to me when I need it?

But can you imagine this: a botnet of 100 computers. 99 have no data stored on them. 1 does. They conspire to make it look like there are 100 copies of the data. You can't know. Ask any of the 100 nodes, they'll all be able to answer your hash question, because they (behind the scenes) ask the 1 computer that can answer, then they report back, making it look like, "wow, 100 nodes have my data!" .
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:11:49
Botnet could keep 1 copy, pretend to have 1000. Just like 1000 bitcoin addresses don't = 1000 people, there is no way to tell how redundant your backups are in this system. There is a financial incentive to lie.

I am not a troll and I'm not stupid. I am a huge bitcoin fanatic, but that does not mean the price will behave the way we want it to, just because it has in the past.
The greater adoption today is why there may not be another "bubble". A good argument for the past bubbles of 2011 &amp; two from 2013 are that it was A LOT harder to buy into BTC, there were FAR fewer people involved setting the price, and there wasn't a massive period where the price had only gone DOWN, slowly, over a year and a half.
Next time the price goes up (assuming it does), it may not be a bubble with little resistance, because people are going to sell, trying to get out before the "next bubble" pops (same logic you are using, that there must be a bubble, therefore, sell before it pops!).
In 2013 if you wanted to sell BTC at $1000 and put buy orders in for 2x more @ $500, you had to keep your cash on Bitstamp or some shady exchange for months hoping they won't steal it. There are now US based exchanges, FDIC insured, and it's easier and safer. This will bring stability to the price. Not bubbles.
Also you did not address my NASDAQ comment. Bitcoin may well be worth $1000 again but I don't see why it has to be soon. Why not 10 years from now? Millions of dollars of bitcoin are being created via inflation, miners are no longer GPUs but people who have to pay the bills.
I think bitcoin is a great idea and probably a good investment, but I also think it could take a very long time to recover. There is a ceiling based on the % of people who would have a need, and the knowhow for bitcoin, and who is to say something like $750 wasn't that ceiling for the next decade or so?

it could completely crash, but that is more of a "the software had a bug" type of a thing. This is just a correction of an over-valued price, there hasn't been a "reason" except supply/demand correction. I mean, Microsoft takes bitcoin as of a month ago - the news is basically all positive - people leaving now are just gambling/panicking about the bottom... which I've seen happen twice before (2011, early 2013).

every 10 minutes bitcoin agrees on all the transactions that took place in the last 10 minutes. this is a block. it is currently limited to be 1 megabyte in size max.
this is "bad" because it limits how many transactions/second that can occur (I think it's like 7 per second if you do the math) and that isn't enough for a worldwide currency, some say...
the limit is arbitrary and could be changed some day. it tries to be a good balance of transactions # vs. disk space, bandwidth cost, etc

What someone really needs to do is offer a "Bank" with insurance on coins. (For the same amount of coins, not dollar value). This would be for people who are not tech savvy in any way, but still want to buy in.
The recent story of the guy who had 500 coins and was suddenly missing 200 (solution was to do -rescan) is an example. He might be in over his head. Trezor might be a solution for some, but even that is too advanced for many people.
There needs to be a service like a bank's safety deposit vault - you buy coins, they hold them, it's a big deal to take the coins out, but they're "safe". A 3rd party insures them for the same amount of coins. I know this is pretty much the opposite of what Bitcoin is about, but I think there are people who want to get involved TODAY but don't trust themselves.
They can learn the "being their own bank" part later (Trezor or whatever the 2nd gen hardware wallet is).
Coinbase is big enough to do this... I don't know who the 3rd party that would insure Coinbase would be, though.

more media coverage: always good news (even if bad)
the arbitrary decimal point turned a lot of people off. Nobody says "I'd buy in if the market cap was 3.5 billion, but 7 billion is too high!".  People who think the idea is cool would have bought in at any price, but they base it off the price of "1 bitcoin" and if that price is lower you'll get more interest.  If the "price" dropped under $100 you'd see  people think "I can finally afford to get one of those coins" - bigger userbase = good thing.
so yeah, I wish people would switch to "bits", but this is the next best thing to get people interested again (who would NEVER have considered buying at $1000, $500 etc - those amounts sound ridiculous )
but I'm not sure if I'd even try to get people involved now, it's not ready for mainstream adoption... it needs to spend more time as a geek-playmoney and tech/nerd hobby before Grandma drops $100 and gets it hacked 3 days later

Coinbase says they are. ("Coinbase holds all customers' USD Wallet funds in a dedicated account at an FDIC-insured financial institution.")
I was only speaking about USD. My point was: in late 2013, if you wanted to sell your BTC and rebuy it later (because you thought it was a bubble), you had to hold your USD on some exchange in Slovenia, BTC-e (?), or Mt Gox!
Now, there is still risk - "holding in FDIC account" does not mean they can't run off with it. But it seems less risky to bet against bitcoin today. More people will bet against Bitcoin if there is a wild price run, because it's safer to do that now, and so I don't think future bubbles will ever be as large or crazy again.

I don't see what creating an atmosphere of "the sky is falling!" for several months does to increase bitcoin's price.
Major news like "Microsoft store now accepts bitcoin" practically causes a DROP in bitcoin value, so I can't see how some technical sounding thing about "block size increases" would do anything for the price either way.
There's an entire subreddit devoted to mocking Bitcoin - I'm not saying they are behind it, but something along those lines seems more likely to me vs.  a sudden group of "big block groupies" appearing out of nowhere, to pump the price (by making it look like doom and gloom, attacks on most of the devs, etc...)

I think the typical bitcoin user does not hang out on reddit or post about bitcoin. Ditto for bitcointalk.
If you believed the posts that get upvoted, you'd think everyone in Greece was buying bitcoin, that there was no bubble at $1000 (any post I made about a possible bubble got instantly downvoted), etc. It's just not reflective of reasonable people, and I'd like to think most people who are interested in bitcoin are reasonable.

You are spot on and have described the situation brilliantly! However, I think there is an element of intentional trolling involved that is keeping this alive a lot longer then it should be. This has become the meme that won't die, and if anything it seems to be getting worse. People should be getting bored by now. It just feels fishy, somehow.
@_date: 2015-07-01 07:46:39
You have absolutely zero evidence for this remark : "the majority of economic stakeholders want a block size increase sooner rather than later". You are confusing the handful of people who sit on reddit posting all day with Bitcoin's actual user base.
It's as if the Linux developers were debating some obscure kernel timing patch and you think people who sell Samsung Galaxy phones care.
Most of these people:
want a slow, careful increase of the blocksize, not a wild 8 to 20 MB one like Gavin suggests.
The average Bitcoin holder, when you tell them this, will undestand and side with the majority of developers.
Nobody sane would want a fork or to cause all this doom and gloom we've been seeing on this subreddit for the last couple months.
@_date: 2015-07-01 11:44:24


If what you are saying is true, they are doing a poor job of this, by (intentionally or not) creating a hostile atmosphere for many of the developers.
Being vocal is one thing, posting insulting silly comics and mass-downvoting the inventor of Hashcash is counter productive. No one is against raising the limit as needed - the details are being debated - but you'd think Blockstream was owned by Bank Of America the way they have been treated lately.

"There is discussion around the mechanics of how to implement increases" - Yes, so why all this doom and gloom? Why this "the sky is falling" atmosphere all of a sudden? Calls for FORKS, calling people shills? Why are there constant attacks on Greg, Adam, etc, on reddit lately? You just said yourself - the devs are working it out on their mailing list, this is totally normal. But you'd never guess from reading reddit the last month or two.

Try telling anyone you know that every single coffee purchase, every single transaction, worldwide, is going to be recorded into a giant database and kept for all time. And that will scale...
Yes, Bitcoin will go far past 3.5tps but it will be layered. There are many proposals (Lightning network is one of them) to sit on top of Bitcoin to archive this. They solve the scaling problem and add all sorts of cool bonus features like instant confirmations, too.

Can you explain how you (*you, personally, BTCisGod*) seem to have nearly unlimited free time to post so much "pro big blocks" posts to reddit?
It seems you are in **every single thread** regarding this topic, posting multiple times. It's like you've got a full time job doing this. It goes way beyond what a normal user would do. I'm honestly curious how you get the time.
I see you post things like this : " Why I'm turning into a troll"
["In order to protect my self interest and the value I place in bitcoin I am actively discouraging new users. This is surprisingly easy to do without even resorting to deceitful practices. Try it yourself."](

I am wondering about an address that is used with bitcoin-qt, on it's own hardware (not vuln. to those 2 known attacks) ie this one, ghash.io -
address has been reused since 2013 , over 20,000 times? and still has 8000 + btc in it... so I assume it is not possible in 2015 to bruteforce a key with that many signatures?
I am wondering how many signatures do let someone bruteforce a private key (At what point does a miner have better luck trying to crack this address vs. mine bitcoin?)  Just a fun thought experiment.

@_date: 2015-02-19 00:29:00
(a little late...)
your bitcoin address is calculated from your priv key, so if you were using bitcoin-qt, you could (1) quit bitcoin-qt and reboot (2) rename your wallet.dat to something else, (3) restart it and go into the console (4) type:
importprivkey yourprivkey
and magically the exact same bitcoin address should pop up in your new address book (under receive addresses).
If a single bit of the privkey was off somehow, you'd get a completely different bitcoin address

There is no way to easily convert BTC to currency :) When that day happens, the price will be more like $10,000/BTC
Right now, it is a pain to convert between the two, and the people who do it are setting the price (currently in the $300's). The "real price" is whatever your exchange of choice is going for at the moment.

ok, first, back those up someplace safe , like to a usb stick
two, make sure you don't have a virus... run malware bytes , i've found a lot of people are surpised they had something...
then install the latest bitcoin.... it makes a wallet.dat the first time you run it .... close it, find that wallet.dat, and overwrite it with yours (copy over your old one) . Run it again... it will take a day or so to sync up, it has to download 11 gigabytes, very slow... but when it is done you'll be set
there are newer wallet programs that are faster, like Electrum... But I'm not sure if they support "wallet.dat" format, you'd have to research

Another thing - people don't realize bitcoin wasn't even possible until 2009. Nobody could figure out how to solve the "double spend problem" or how to release the currency in a fair way.
If that had been known, we'd have had something like bitcoin back in the AOL days. It really is a breakthrough, not just something some people threw together one day to make "funny money".
There's a huge chunk of the planet that is catching up to the rest of us in terms of technology, and they want to trade with us. THEY WANT TO GIVE US THEIR MONEY. Good luck buying or selling something to the Ukraine - no paypal.

 lets you "invest" in a site that gets 6000 BTC+ bets a day. The site should have a 1% return on all bets (over time). The operator is considered pretty trustworthy.
You could also buy alt coins on a site like btce or mcxnow, such as litecoin or primecoin(XPM).  Some times people like to "pump and dump" these coins, if you buy at the right time and set an order to sell at, say, 25% returns, you may find in a few months that it sold during one of these pumps. Has happened to me a few times.
Both are RISKY

random thought, be sure to run a ram tester (like memtest86) for a day or two before you format + install the OS. just to make sure, it's unlikely to cause problems but bad ram can go undetected unless you look for it and then suddenly your wallet is corrupted... so test it first to be safe

They're all clones.
In other words, someone took the bitcoin code and changed a few things.
Some of the changes are innovative, but the thing to remember is, those coins usually just have 1 programmer working on them, but bitcoin has a team of people.
And if anything goes wrong with bitcoin, these will have the same issue since they are 99% the same code.
@_date: 2013-11-14 03:42:55
No, you should be fine backing up every 100 transactions or so. Nothing was lost.
HOWEVER - Do yourself a HUGE favor and buy a used computer for $100 and put everything bitcoin related there. Dell sells nice refurb computers (core 2 duo/4gb ram) on ebay. Don't use your main, internet-connected computer with a 300 BTC wallet!  That's a disaster waiting to happen.
Also Read up on Armory... a program that you could use on this new, offline pc that lets you still spend BTC safely.
Finally, start making backups! Get some blank CD's or something and make a backup every 6 months and stick it in your sock drawer. Don't use a USB stick because you'll be tempted to use that on an internet-connected computer someday

I don't think there is an analogy, and trying to fit it to one makes the whole thing more confusing. Maybe just focus on the fact that "there are things that are hard to solve but easy to verify".

you could keep it around for this sort of thing... just never plug it into the internet.
if later, you want to use it, get a program that wipes your hard drive (fills it all with 0's) and then it would be safe to do whatever you want at that point. I think Acronis makes a program that does this... you boot off a CD, it wipes the hard drive completely.
but yes the only way to make an address /wallet you can trust is with a computer that you formatted &amp; loaded windows onto yourself, and then never expose to the internet. there is a program called Armory that is used in this kind of setup when you want to spend the coins (without using the internet on that pc... it makes a file that you copy to a internet-connected PC for each transaction)
if all of this is too much of a PITA you could do the opposite - take the PC that's had your wallet and stick it in the closet, and get a 2nd computer to surf the web on.  Wait until "hardware wallets" are out (probably early next year) and buy one of those. There's the "trezor" I think due in January.

it seems wiser to have your wallet and whatnot be in a local directory, then you manually make backups to dropbox.  I've seen dropbox eat files &amp; I don't notice until over 30 days (can't get it back). It's very rare but it could happen (and did happen to a friend).
I don't know anything about multibit however

Google trends - check out the graph for bitcoin.
Lots of hype lately, not really anything to show for it. I don't find it any easier to use then in April (last crash/also last time google trends peaked).
I think it will be 3-5 years before things really pick up. We need easy "hardware wallets" and more ways to buy bitcoin (most newbies can't even get them, it's too damn hard)

A lot of non-techy people assume a program like bitcoin is obvious. They don't realize that top mathematics / crypto experts thought bitcoin was impossible until 2009. The reason it was never done until now isn't because the idea is silly or fake, it's because nobody could figure out how. Bitcoin was an actual breakthrough.
So now that this breakthrough happened - think - Even if only 1% of the world uses it ("for nerd stuff") that's billions of dollars worldwide.
We'd have been doing this in the AOL days if someone had made the breakthrough back then.

I would be more worried your computer has malware or a virus that you don't know about. Not all of them are obvious. Don't send coins to a computer unless you are 100% sure that computer is virus free.
The wallet program stores your keys (the data that lets you use the coins) in a file, in the main bitcoin it is called wallet.dat, you should back this up to a usb stick or burn it to a CD or something, so if the computer dies you can still get to your coins

See 
They are pretty small, have not had much luck getting people to trade LTC/BTC on their site. Right now, they have 20K LTC / 27BTC on their site. They even give you interest on your deposit, so people are earning $$ by keeping their LTC/BTC in there, and yet that did not really take much of btc-e's customers away.
Plus it's really hard to program something like that, you'd have lots of competition, and you'd be betting that LTC is still important 6-12 months from now (it looked like it was going to die a months ago)

If you've got the stomach for it, you could just send BTC to one of the riskier exchanges (no verification) like BTC-E.  The "cash" you get is hard to get out, but since you want to daytrade, that's fine.
Just be OK with, when all is said and done, taking it out as BTC again (not cash)
@_date: 2013-11-10 10:29:04
first, you came up with the figure 1K btc, not me. plenty of people report having small amounts of btc stolen.
two, if I had 1K btc to play with (that I stole), it would be SMART to buy ltc. I'd slowly dump it for cash on btc-e, then buy LTC . The price of LTC would skyrocket and a huge "pump" would start. People like fontas have done this in the past many times, this is why ltc has a 100 million dollar market cap this weekend when it was worthless last year. hint: it's not because anyone actually uses litecoin.
three, obviously they would not use a compliant exchange, they'd use btce or mcxnow or some alt-coin only exchange
The more you move the coins around to a site like btce, just-dice, etc, the harder you've made it to track. In fact, I'd say you've made it impossible to track. these sites are not logging IP's and don't follow US law.
posting something like "you really have no idea what you are talking about" is being a dick. there are 100 ways to phrase that in an adult way, but you choose to write it in the "internet fuckwad" way. Just because you can be a prick on the internet doesn't mean you should be.

if you boot off a linux CD and do all this offline.. yes this is probably safe. I know there is a youtube video out there that explains all this... you make a linux cd, save bitaddress.org to a flash drive, then boot off the CD (with internet unplugged) and print out the wallets.

*I also believe the analogies to the early WWW are flawed. I think analogies to the IP protocol are more apt and that we've only begun to imagine the possibilities.*
I think they are good when trying to explain how easy it will be some day. Early internet: you needed to get a copy of "trumpet winsock" because windows did not have TCP/IP built in. You often had to set up your modem. You needed to get settings from your ISP to set all this up. Now, the cable guy comes out, and BAM, internet. Zero knowledge required. Or, go to a McDoanlds (free wifi). Etc.
Right now it is too hard and people forget these things work themselves out over time.

people will say I'm wrong, but I think an old PC, with windows XP is perfect. XP came out before bitcoin , so you know there isn't some hidden bitcoin-related code in it. And since you are never going to plug it into the internet, it's fine.
but if you want to use armory, you currently need 6GB and 64bit OS
@_date: 2013-11-26 10:27:00
you don't store the coins, the coins "exist" in the network.
you just store the "key" (which is very small) that lets you say "move this coin somewhere else"
the 11GB blockchain is just a history of all transactions ever done - you don't need that (only the main bitcoin wallet program makes use of it).... the other wallet programs use a smarter way to know what the history is
so yeah, 2gb flash drive can hold unlimited coins (essentially). you're main concern should be the flash drive - those things are very unreliable and can mess up files without you knowing it. make some backups to a blank CD at least!
@_date: 2013-11-13 03:48:40
The closest thing is just-dice
They hold 57,000 btc I think!  On average the house comes out ahead 1% (over time), and you and the other 57K invested split that profit.  But they have gone negative a few times, so it has risk. The guy who runs the site is well respected, but there's risk there too (in giving someone else your coins)
I did the math a few days ago, 10 BTC invested earns you about $2.50 USD a day... 
@_date: 2013-11-11 08:38:23
In the main bitcoin, there is a option "backup wallet" , saves wallet.dat file to a usb stick. Then if the computer crashes, reload it, and "restore wallet" on the new(restored) computer.

It is safer to spend $150 on an old used computer (check Dell's ebay auctions) and have a "poor man's hardware wallet" that you never connect to the internet. Back that wallet.dat up to several usb sticks, DVD-Rs, etc. A lot of work but safe (unlike brain wallets)

@_date: 2013-11-30 13:02:53
first, your wallet has many addresses, not just 1. It starts with 100 empty addresses.
when you send coins, the program finds an address you currently own that has a big enough balance in it.
it sends 100% of it - the part you wanted to send goes where ever you sent it, and the rest goes into a new address (this is saved in your wallet file).
the old address is then never reused. Unless, of course, you give it out to somone and they send more coins to it.

bitcoin is not reversible, when you get the coins, you've got them, the sender can't take them back
BUT money is - paypal someone , get 1 BTC, then wait 2 weeks and complain, you have a good chance of getting the money back (free bitcoins!)   so unless you meet someone face to face and hand them cash, it is unwise for the bitcoin seller to give you BTC without huge risk

Someone has to write the code, and it isn't going to be you (unless you are a C++ guru with strong cryptography background). You have to trust someone. If they start adding bad features, you can choose to keep using the old software, and a "fork" will happen, the old software on "the original blockchain" and the version with the new features on the "new blockchain". The new version will almost certainly die off, because it is nearly impossible to get everyone to switch.

Mining is not an option for the little guy, now
Buy two bitcoins
keep one, wait 5 years
sell the 2nd one in a week - so you are comfortable with the process in both directions

Wouldn't the price rise (making everyone happy) and people just move the decimal places over?
@_date: 2013-11-14 07:28:29
I think greed brings out the bad side of people.

Bitcoin is just getting started. Look at all the positive media attention it has gotten. I predict, looking back 10 years from now, this will be one of several bubbles before it stabilized.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:25:07
price stability = time
each day bitcoin doesn't "get hacked" , add some amount to the value people are willing to assign it
there will be bubbles and dips, but the true value is some combination of the # of days bitcoin has been around combined with the # of merchants that accept it

There's something pretty exciting about opening up the world of daytrading, investing, global money trading, etc to the average joe with just a PC. No paperwork to fill out, taxes (unless you cash out), banks etc. that's the main value IMHO
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:28:32
mining, no, it's dead except for big players
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:32:40
don't know about multibit, but it can't hurt to do it every once in a while to various media (blank cd, usb stick, blank dvd, etc - they all can get "bit rot" over time)

That address, 
19DgB5WJ56PzFzvvLQuzhLwhiAGjUSoRCm 0.29566719 BTC
should be in your wallet.dat
Not sure why it would not be...
@_date: 2013-11-12 05:54:27
this happened just before the April crash FYI
@_date: 2013-11-11 09:04:17
Calm before the storm :)
Last crash, there was a long boring steady period, then a huge jump, then CRASH

"Why is it being assumed that Bitcoin is going to definitely become the next big thing?"
It might not. It could end up being a "nerd thing" used only by tech savvy people. 1% of the world's population is still 70000000 people.
"What is the point of it, really?"
it let's everyone on the planet participate in capitalism. A few years ago I wanted to donate to an open source project hosted in the Ukraine (I think). He couldn't take paypal. The current financial system is a nightmare for world trade, bitcoin makes the whole thing a few clicks of a mouse.

Another thing we can do is read the "new" tab and answer this huge influx of  "what is this.. how do I..." questions that keep getting posted by newbies. I've spent about 10 hours over the last few days trying to answer as many as I can.

Seems to be doing surprisingly well without him
@_date: 2013-12-14 01:42:34
you could try to send a message to the site's owner on bitcointalk
Goodl luck!
edit: better yet, post here

why would he owe short term cap. gains?  maybe he got the coins over a year ago..
@_date: 2013-11-22 07:23:10
the only 100% safe way is to make a new wallet, and everything there. even if you delete the wallet off the work computer, it could still be recovered (unlikely) unless you wipe the HD with 0's (which I assume you don't want to do)
@_date: 2013-11-11 12:04:17
after a few generations people will asume satoshi's coins are lost, etc (assuming he never shows up again!)
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:03:57
I felt this way during the April boom. Crazy, this time I KNEW it was a bubble at $300.. and $500... and $700..  and.. well.. derp.
I just don't understand how this much cash has gotten into the exchanges in the last week to push the price up. I'd have thought the exchanges would run out of cash!
Are people just rebuying at a loss, over and over?
@_date: 2013-12-14 05:16:03
they require you to check email to withdraw, so that means your email has been hacked too

nvidia is not worth it
if you really want to mine - research primecoin - it's CPU and you might earn a dollar or two a day - trade them on btce for bitcoins

The scariest thing I've seen is btc-e trollbox (chat room) and it's pretty funny, mostly teenagers daytrading. I'd have been glued to my computer 24/7 at the age of 12 if that had existed back then.
@_date: 2013-11-11 06:53:28
check out the calculator at   and see yourself!
@_date: 2013-11-12 12:13:35
the real cost is buying $100,000 + worth of LTC/BTC to put on your exchange, because nobody will move their coins over unless there's a market already there (vs. sites like btc-e with 3-4 million dollars in ltc buy/sell orders)
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:13:00
Since you can divide 1 BTC into chunks of .00000001 , that is not really a reason. Someone can buy 0.05 BTC and it will still double in value the next time bitcoin doubles in value...
@_date: 2013-11-14 03:57:41
They also don't get how FUN it is!  I've been a techie for 25 years and can't think of the last time I've had this much fun.
Go to a site like btc-e, which I think is mostly teens, and watch them daytrade (and troll eachother) - it's like a game, with real consequences. It's fun as hell and there's never been anything like this.
 
@_date: 2013-11-29 11:24:29
BTC-e may have the worst customer support in all of bitcoin land. This includes scam sites! - even tradefortress was polite and answered emails.
All I can say is - keep writing them. English is not their native language. Keep it simple
