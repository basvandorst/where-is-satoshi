Yup! Feel free to watch on your own time but tune in if you have a few minutes. These are real authorities on the subject we have speaking

I think you may just need to tune in to get your answer ;) Sounds like this talk is for you! If you can't make the livestream it'll be on the web shortly thereafter.
Edit: As for my specific opinion I would say that I forsee Bitcoin being the first of many applications.

Bitcoin but there will be an emphasis on the underlying technology, the Blockchain.
@_date: 2015-07-27 23:06:57
Believe me, the secure and decentralized nature is exactly what interests us. I'm not sure we'd even be talking about it if that wasn't the case haha
@_date: 2015-07-27 20:36:05
As I said above I'm looking into that now. Not sure what I can or can't say since this very issue may be addressed during the talk. I'll let you know ASAP!
@_date: 2015-07-27 20:35:12
I'm looking into this now. I'll either answer here directly or one of our speakers will address it directly during the talk. Sorry for being coy! I'll definitely get back to you ASAP.
Edit: Looks like they'll touch on that tonight. Sorry we're getting started a couple minutes late all! If you ragequit on us the whole thing will be online right afterwards.

No I'm not but your post is what inspired me to post here haha. Microsoft is really excited about the implications of the Blockchain. Like, we get that Bitcoin is huge but the underlying technology is what we're really interested in exploring. 
Think election results, financial auditing, all of these processes that required a certain degree of trust in easily corruptible 3rd parties. Technologies like Bitcoin and the Blockchain are breaking down that hub and spoke model and I for one could not be more excited.
Not that you asked for any of that info :P

I'm sorry to hear that! Maybe try switching browsers? I hope that works...
@_date: 2015-07-27 21:51:11
Unfortunately, I have not. Hey Bill, if you read this, we'd love to have you swing by Civic Hall in NYC! 
@_date: 2015-07-27 21:31:37
Maybe Bing Video ;) Jk. Sort of. It will be on YouTube though. 
@_date: 2015-07-27 21:52:59
Oh people are very much aware of it. I think the overall feeling is that Bitcoin is the beginning of something big, but it's not the be-all-end-all of this technology on its own. 
But I can't presume to speak for 100k+ people so be sure to take that with more than a grain of salt.
