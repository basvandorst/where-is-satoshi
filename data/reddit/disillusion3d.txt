exactly! he could have explained what was going on, instead he tried to slither away, looking just as guilty as ever.

id say thats more of a theory than evidence. theres a pretty big distinction.

I am so sick of all our politicians being such uninformed, short sighted, money grubbing, bad actors. :(

They would always list bitcoin as 29% higher than everyone else so if you wanted to buy in there you would pay more.. then when they started to tank because nobody could ever get money out quickly enough they started all this BS and ran the price down to 500ish and said we cant pay out in bitcoin, just fiat (if your lucky). 
I think they scammed the funds and now are giving people about half the fiat they bought in with. They are throwing the Bitcoin community under the bus to try to cover it up.
