I wouldn't expect him to have any idea what bitcoin is, or why he should invest in it.
He's the worlds greatest investor in the things that he know, (calculating assets etc) - finding out what a company is actually worth relativ to what the stock price represents. If the stock prise is below what it should be, he's buying. (a lot, for long term)
there is no way he would understand the potential of bitcoins without understanding it at the technical level, in order to see all of its applications and implications.
He didn't even invest in microsoft in the late 80s even when bill gates tried to explain it to him.
He says himself that he doesn't invest in things that he can not understand. He dont even use a computer at his office.
On the other hand, this man has analysed the american market since the 40s, and he said in the early 2000s that he has never seen anything grow so quickly as the technological revolution is growing, (this is 15 years ago and it has been growing at this rate ever sense)
Sillicon valley is now generating 14% of US GDP. Thats actually more then some countries whole GDP alone. And now that this technology is getting its own money, i think its going to be hard to predict how huge this economy is going to be in the future. but based on these numbers is growing exponentially, i`d say that its going to be pritty damn HUGE!

The market is flooded with Oil. US pumped up 4,5 millions of oil barrels of its new shale oil last year alone. In comparison, Norway as one of the wealthiest countries in the world per capita pumped up 1,5.
Middle east is also pumping up more, and China, the biggest consumer of oil had a slight decrease in its economic groth(Less demand). Price goes down.
Please dont apply your high school economics in such a complex economic system and try to make a theory out it. Big chance you might be wrong on every assumption in that theory.

@_date: 2015-01-08 00:22:11
Very good arguments, but when i look at all the VC that are getting in on this then im think that the chicken is roosting ^^
Startups right now needs resources to create adoptable apps, making it easier to use bitcoin, and find new ways to implement it in to all sorts of thing. So i think(hope) that we are in that stage right now.
  
Im really looking forward to getting a good crowd funding multy-sig platform up and running, so that i can buy shares with my bitcoins in good startups that really needs funding right now. And then we might see a snowball effect. plus, if bitcoiners invest in the right companies, they will make a great profit in all of this.
@_date: 2015-01-04 21:08:34
Its not the right time for mainstream adoption in my view, Bitcoin still needs a lot mot more infrastructure/killer apps.
Things that people automatically will adopt. At this point, bitcoin is kind of useless in everyday life. but we are getting there, smart people just need to write extreme amount of codes to get there.
If you look at all the revolutions that spread like wildfire through internet, non of them really needed any commercials, (Napster, torrent, facebook, email, html, etc etc etc etc etc etc.......) people just adapted them because they either solved a problem or it was just much easier and better to use. Bitcoin might be the biggest thing that ever happened to the internet, and it will sure solve ALOT of problems for people, but right now, it dosent solve anything by simply owning a bitcoin. (except getting filthy rich when the demands of bitcoin is going through the roof)
When bitcoin is ready, people will adopt it like CRAZY. 
We might see a couple of bubbles until that time (i dont know) but it will reach a point when bitcoin is just to big to fail.. ever. and a cup of coffee costs a satoshi.

I too have these concerns. Also, Look at the block size debate. If we thought bitcoin is almost getting political now, then if this really takes of. Bitcoin will become extremely political. Mining power too. 
My list of worrying about how it will unfold, if it gets real is huge.
However, I'm heavily invested in it. Before these are real concerns, I will still have made a huge gain from it. And, i think that the abstract idea that blockchain tech will take over the world is not that far fetched, but 20 years down the road.

It seems like they are building a platform for machine-2-machine payments, and probably machine value transfer in general. Lets say your phone mines 500 satoshi, every token can represent anything of value. These tokens can be sent around within the 21 inc chain without transaction fee to the bitcoin network. kind of like what change tip do for social networks, 21 inc will do for machine value transfer. eliminating cost makes micropayments possible
I would guess =)

I think its two answers to that question. 
1. No wealth distribution will probably be worse than it already is.
2. But the economic explosion that can arose from such a effective global economic system, in what consumer get in goods and services will increase the global economic wealth.

Yes i would say so. Lets take a hypothetical, and say hydro fusion breakthrough and i t was up and running.
Then the price of electricity would drop like a rock, making mining more profitable. That would incentive mining even more. Adding more hashing power.

Ofc, you only need to make one assumption about technologies that uses the blockchain without bitcoin, and that is that bitcoin has value,  in ordrer for the system to work. And as long as it has value so that miners mine, it can be used to 1000x other things, and they are all going to be exploited. Witch is good, all new use cases will give bitcoin indirectly more value, When people look at Bitcoin as commodity or store of value.
So i think we agree.

Its both. And no, Satoshi knew that bitcoin could not handle all tx in the world on chain. Thats why we need sidechains. And use bitcoin blockchain as a settlement network for the sidechains.

I use it a lot when i travel, and i travel a lot. I log onto my home bank via internet, buy bitcoins in my home country (low fees) uses xabo debit card around the world. Or find a ATM to send bitcoins to and get cash. I buy books of amazon with gift ++++
But for the most part.. i HOLD! =) 
EDIT: Its kindof funny, if i buy say 50$ worth of bitcoins, once they are converted into bitcoins they all of a sudden have way more value to me. I dont really want to spend them. Consequently i spend less money.

Its function as a secure settlement network over communication system.

@_date: 2015-10-06 20:54:18
Dear r/bitcoin, theres too much ideology of what bitcoin is suppose to be. Bitcoin is raw technology like the internett, and its going to develop in a lot of different ways and change many different industries regardless of your or people ideoligy. And if one segment bitcoin succeeds in the financial world, its not on the expends of other segments of what bitcoin can offer in other industries. Bitcoin as a currency may still succeed as a global currency. 
This would be like saying in the early 90s that no google is bad, internett is not suppose to be a search engine. its a electronic mailing tool. not realizing that its both, and a WHOLE lot of other things, all at the same time.

2. block size debate

4. sidechains.

I think if we hit massive adoption now, people would have all sorts of problem that will probably be fikset in the future. Like really low technical knowledge to store bitcoins safely.

When i was younger i was interested in the Bittorrent protocol, and an active uploader in closed torrent sites. Ive seen from the inside how open source projects usually spawns innovation, When smart coders are excited about a open source project, its amazing how far it can go. and this is 100x times bigger than anything I've ever seen, and all the smart coders are excited about this. So im pretty confident it will succeed. When i first realized the potential of this, my brain almost exploded

I dont want to be too persistent on this, i may have misunderstood it, but on investopedia it says: 
"BREAKING DOWN 'Market Capitalization'
If a company has 35 million shares **outstanding**, each with a market value of $100, the company's market capitalization is $3.5 billion (35,000,000 x $100 per share).
Company size is a basic determinant of asset allocation and risk-return parameters for stocks and stock mutual funds. The term should not be confused with a company's "capitalization," which is a financial statement term that refers to the sum of a company's shareholders' equity plus long-term debt."
It seems to me to be the outstanding shares/coins. Thus coins bought, and not satoshi`s "free" coins 
I really dont care about being right, but if I'm wrong then i would be glad if you could clarify this for me =)
@_date: 2015-10-06 21:34:38
