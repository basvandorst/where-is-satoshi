The point seems to have gone over your head. Not trying to be rude, just trying to enlighten. What he's saying here is that there he personally sees the value in bitcoin. Many people here (understandably so) put value in it based off its current value against the dollar. He is highlighting the intrinsic value and utility of bitcoin in and of itself.
Or I could be completely wrong.

That's not the point I'm contending. Free market theory allows for small nodes to become larger the more they are used. Thus, any node will grow organically in response to any connected larger nose being closed. Yes, smaller nodes will open channels for the purpose of making inefficient one time payments, but that isn't the intended purpose of LN. If you can't figure out what that purpose is, you need to do more reading.

@_date: 2018-01-12 03:04:45
If I could afford something like that, I would absolutely use it. The problem you'll have initially is that the value of bitcoin will change compared to the dollar from the moment its sent to the time its received. You would either take a slight potential initial loss or gain or hold for a month or two and likely net a larger profit.

Generate a wallet address from the Trezor wallet you currently have access to. Make sure you have the seed for this wallet as well. Wipe the Trezor and restore with other wallets seed. Send funds to address you previously generated with first wallet. Wipe Trezor and restore with first seed and wait for funds to arrive.

Have you even read anything about the layers of the blockchain protocol mimicking the layers of the internet? The most and smartest devs are working on bitcoin core and layer 2 solutions. Its obvious you're pushing alts here but let me leave you with this: what do you think would happen if an alt suddenly took over bitcoin in value? You think the average Joe would switch or pull out all of their money from crypto altogether?
What you're rooting for is essentially the end of cryptocurrencies.

I believe you need to use a pool like slush or zpool to mine to an external wallet. You can probably find the wallet address on zpool, but you'll need to find out what wallet you might have used at the time. Like electrum or something.

Most smart people will hold until they have a life changing amount they can cash in on.
The thing is....90% of these people will have realized the value and utility of Bitcoin in advance of this, specifically because they are smart. So - it stands to reason that most people will have bought far more Bitcoin than they ever intend to sell.
Since this is a self fulfilling prophecy, I can easily imagine Bitcoin hitting unimaginable numbers for people who don't understand it.
I personally won't ever be selling my BTC for fiat.

Not true. Its a factor of how long someone intends to keep the channel open that determines how much they are paid in fees by the number of transactions that are routed through that channel.

Sell your Bitcoin through robinhood, buy it back on an exchange that will let you transfer out, like coinbase. Buy a hardware wallet (trezor is good) and send your Bitcoin there.
You should make an effort to learn why it's important to do this though. Everyone should.
@_date: 2019-07-20 17:16:32
If people in general are as smart as I give them credit for, and continue to learn and trade fiat for Bitcoin, I think it has to go higher than that.
Really, in terms of value against the dollar, there is no ceiling in that scenario.
Even without hyperinflation.
@_date: 2019-07-27 20:17:07
You have to make a couple assumptions to begin with that 95% of people in this sub already have ;
1.	A good with a finite supply will always be worth more than a good with an infinite supply.
2.	There is effectively an infinite supply of fiat, and really any other good in the universe.
If you agree with the aforementioned assumptions, the one I made is inevitable.
There's a reason why the price of gold has risen relative to fiat and really all other commodities since the dawn of civilization. Stock / flow and scarcity.
Stop throwing stones from your glass house.
@_date: 2019-07-20 01:14:21
You're wrong.
If less than half of the Bitcoin injected into the system 4 years ago is now being injected into the system, and population growth means there is a larger demand year after year, how would products be priced compared to 4 years ago if 'everything' is priced against Bitcoin?
They would absolutely have to be priced in less Bitcoin today than 4 years ago. That is simple supply and demand.
@_date: 2019-07-08 05:32:02
You might not be able to. I know they were having issues allowing new user withdrawals the last time I onboarded someone (this was late April or early May).
Otherwise you should be able to tap on your Bitcoin balance and then click on Withdraw balance. If that button isn't working, then it sounds like you're having the same issue I encountered with my friend.
@_date: 2019-07-08 20:08:48

These guys have obviously figured out how to make it seem like money was deposited into your account. You then send them Bitcoin via an irreversible transaction, and your bank calls you shortly thereafter to tell you that the amount they deposited bounced.

How would you spend said Bitcoin with a visa card? Right now, a confirmed transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain can take upwards of an hour.
I doubt you'll want to swipe your visa then wait an hour at the store?
The lightning network allows for instantaneous transactions with fees of 1 Satoshi or less.
Lightning allows these features on top of the most decentralized, immutable, and reliable store of value the world has ever seen. That's why its required for every day purchases.
For something like a home or car, the Bitcoin blockchain is preferable.

@_date: 2019-07-21 16:02:35
I think that the bigger deal is there is no way to know how much the creators kept for themselves vs how much is being distributed.
My prediction is that Bitcoin dominance will slowly grow to 80-90% while 90% of shitcoins are being essentially wiped out.
If you are into shitcoins, you will basically need a crystal ball to figure out which one will survive, but it's likely Eth, Litecoin, and monero rise from the ashes.

3 million divided by 8 billion is 37k Satoshis. Don't assume that all Bitcoin would be evenly divided in the future.
In fact, the majority would likely have access to far fewer than 37k Satoshis due to the fact that most people won't ever own any Bitcoin even after the 2024 having.
That is absolutely not a problem, as there needs to be a majority of the population that always wants more than they have. It ultimately makes Bitcoin even more valuable over time.

Hash power isn't just for show. It means Bitcoin is backed by actual companies doing work to make the network the most secure there is. Small blocks enable massive decentralization compared to ANY other shitcoin. 
Bitcoin has shown time and time again its monetary policy CANNOT be changed due in large part to the aforementioned features of its blockchain. NO shitcoin can even come close to making the same claim.

Why does everyone automatically assume there would be a role for lending Bitcoin in a Bitcoin denominated world?
If Bitcoin does what it promises to do and actually continues to grow in value relative to everything else, many things would change.
IMO these are a few things that would:
1.	'Borrowing' would be replaced by waiting. You may not have enough Bitcoin to buy what you want now,  but prices would fall year after year in a predictable manner, giving you a good idea if you have enough Bitcoin to eventually make the purchase, and when that is likely to happen.
2.	Haggling would become much more common. In this world Bitcoin would be the top thing to want in exchange for any good, but there will still be other currencies because not everyone will own Bitcoin, just as not everyone owns gold today. If you have Bitcoin to trade, you would likely be able to set your own price, especially if less and less people want to 'sell' their Bitcoin for other currencies.
3.	Companies would now be %100 customer centric because they would be afraid of losing the opportunity cost of more Bitcoin today vs. Less Bitcoin tomorrow. Conversely, customers will be much more cautious about making sure products are top notch and less likely to spend on frivolous items because BTC will always be worth more in the hand tomorrow than that item was today.
Just my thoughts on this topic when anyone mentions how Bitcoin doesn't jive with a debt based system (you're right - it doesn't).

@_date: 2019-07-14 03:33:07
TBH you sound like you've already made up your mind and that's fine. No one is going to give you any better an answer than "I think it will be the next world reserve currency".
There are some numbers that don't lie though. The number of nodes securing the blockchain has been growing exponentially since it's inception. Hashpower mining transactions has grown exponentially since it's inception. The number of people who are using blockchain has grown exponentially. The number of people who understand how bitcoin works has grown exponentially.
Sure, bitcoin doesn't work of your standard Keynesian economics, it's based on the Austrian view. Hard money always drives out the less hard money.
There is too much talk about how deflation is 'bad' in a keynesian system, but it's not really known if this is true or not with a hard money.
I look at it this way - the internet was pretty niche in '95 yes? If you could have bought a share of the internet in '95 without knowing what you do today about how big it has become, would you have thrown a few bucks at it to see how it plays out?
Well I'm sure a growing number of people would as the internet became popular, and the same thing is happening now with bitcoin. The only difference being, there isn't really a limit to how much stock that can be issued, but there is a limit on how many bitcoins can be created, and we will be at 99% of that limit in 12 years.
@_date: 2019-07-03 06:23:16
No, you can't mine it with Bitcoin core.
You either have to mine altcoins with your GPUs (look into nicehash), or buy expensive ASICS and join a mining pool.
Again though, if your power cost is &gt; 10 cents per kwH, it's better to buy it directly.

@_date: 2019-07-19 21:12:59
I had heard about it in 2010 or 2011 but had somehow managed to avoid actually looking into the technology and learning what it was about until recently.
The moment I saw the wiki on the controlled supply of Bitcoin, it made 100% sense in my mind that this would be an unstoppable force, due to the nature of the known supply, release schedule, miner incentive, decentralization and the psychology that plays into the determination of value.
The crazy thing is, even though I know I'm super late to the game compared to when I should have gotten in, I know we're still so incredibly early overall.
This thing is headed for unimaginable heights. People who are looking for stability won't ever find it in Bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-07-09 06:15:02
I think it requires people with money to understand what makes a good investment.
It's not a stretch to think that IS the reason why Bitcoin is as popular as it is today. People have been doing this.
People who have money are smart with it. It comes with the territory. I think the 2017 bull market got people excited for the wrong reasons, and the smart money knows that.

I agree it's annoying but only because it's a shortsighted reason to not be excited about Bitcoin.
These people haven't seen past Bitcoin as solely a medium of exchange and therefore that's their only guage of its efficacy.
I don't think the fees or speed on the underlying Bitcoin blockchain will improve any time soon, but I also think that's a feature, not a bug.
It is what keeps Bitcoin the most decentralized, hack proof, and bad actor proof - network known to man.
This is what gives Bitcoin it's value.
Once you realize this, that people want this predictability, you understand why shitcoins don't really serve any purpose that we can't already replicate with the dollar.
Then you look ahead to the lightning network and realize what true blockchain projects look like.

The reward for confirming a transaction is much less than mining a block so I doubt miners would leave the space.

You won't get any Bitcoin this way,if that's what you're thinking. You either A. Need to buy it, or B. Need to mine it.
B requires expensive hardware and is usually more expensive over time than just purchasing it outright.
Right now what you're doing is running a node to help keep the network decentralized.

What? Scalability is only a problem in the context of an application where scale is needed. Bitcoin as a store of value does not need that scale just as how the first layer of the internet does not need the second layer to perform its core functions. Second layer solutions are the answer.

@_date: 2017-12-25 05:07:49
Except that this is currently impossible.
7000tps will add 7000KB to the ledger every second. Pruning is trivial to implement to keep the overall size of the ledger down but the speed that the ledger is increasing/updating at is going to scale with tps. That means full nodes who want to keep their ledgers updated will be required to download information on 7000 transactions every second. One transaction equates to about 1KB meaning staying in sync with the growing ledger will require 7MB/s download bandwidth.
An attacker could decide to spend money on a thousand nvidia teslas and spam the rai network with 7000tps to create this effect. Full nodes will go out of sync shortly after.
You can either gimp the network to avoid bandwidth bottlenecks (something like 100tps would be easy to handle for 99% of nodes and would be a very respectable real world number in the blockchain ecosystem) or you can look for ways of creating consensus without going over bandwidth limitations. Instead of global consensus you could settle for local consensus that way not every transaction has to be download by every node but only by just enough nodes to validate that transaction.

I think one of the big things keeping the price of bitcoin stable in relation to other crypto currencies is the fact that there are many pools that let users mine alts, then convert them to bitcoin for a payout. This occurs fairly frequently no matter the current price of BTC.

You would just need to make sure your PSU is capable of handling however many cards your motherboard can hold. Remember also spacing might be a factor.  is a good calculator to use.

If you guys have bitcoin core running on Windows and are having trouble using this guide and transferring your blocks and chainstate folders to the pi external drive -
1.	Format the drive to ntfs on Windows
2.	sudo apt-get install ntfs-3g to install ntfs drivers on pi
3.	Plug external drive into pi
4.	Run lsblk -f to get drive uuid
5.	Edit /etc/fstab with correct uuid, ntfs-3g as the file system, and 'rw' instead of 'default' from the guide
6.	mkdir /mnt/hdd
7.	sudo mount -a
8.	mkdir bitcoin (on the external drive)
9.	Plug your drive into your Windows machine and transfer the blocks and chainstate folders
The rest of it should follow the guide the rest of the way.

@_date: 2018-09-05 02:43:27
I don't agree. The amount at which its trading doesn't necessarily mean it could all be sold at that valuation. Too many people hear these high numbers, instantly do some mental math to find out that means bitcoin market cap is one quadrillion dollars and say it's impossible without hyper inflation.
IMO market cap is a meaningless metric for a currency. What is the market cap of the dollar? Its not M1. Its the value of the asset against a currency.
If we were to say our currency is really bitcoin, and the asset its measured against is dollars, we could say that 1 quadrillion dollars could be measured exactly with 21 million bitcoin. Now the question is how many people would trade their bitcoin for any amount of dollars, if you could spend a proportional amount for the same good or service?
@_date: 2018-09-01 23:01:09
There would be many incentives for exchanges to work this way. The major one being no extra fees for them or their customers.

No mind games. Think of all the people who sold off after buying in at $1 when it 'crashed' from $100 to $80 in 2014. I bet they are congratulating themselves for avoiding that 20% drop?

@_date: 2018-08-21 04:52:00
Every bitcoin wallet has a private key. With that private key anyone has access to move funds out of a wallet.
The fact that you gave him access to your wallet even momentarily was enough for him to steal your private key (in the settings menu) and move the funds.

The problem I have with your theory here is that it assumes that the value against the dollar is what matters. What really matters is its value against goods and services vs. using dollars for the same goods and services.
I could easily see a world in which you could buy the same item for EITHER a very high amount of dollars, OR a much lower amount of bitcoin. In this world, would you rather be holding onto dollars? Or bitcoin?
If I had 1 bitcoin in that world, and the chance to turn that bitcoin into ten million dollars, I'd want to keep the fucking bitcoin.

You yourself said you are new to bitcoin (this being your first experience). Everyone needs to take time to understand how bitcoin works before trying to send anything to anyone.
Sounds like you 'funded' a bitcoin wallet that the scammer had the private keys to, and he allowed you access to a 'watch only' version of that wallet.
I think it's probably best to stop being so defensive, take this as a learning opportunity that people won't randomly give you money, and really learn how bitcoin works.
If the only reason you tried to use bitcoin was for this sole purpose, and you could care less about why it's revolutionary, you'd be doing yourself an even greater disservice by not at least trying to understand it at this point.

You have a private key from which many public addresses can be generated. The bitcoin protocol defines a cryptographic hash function which will generate millions of these addresses in conjunction with your private seed.

The idea that most transactions will happen over lightning is intriguing. Is there a possibility that services will pop up that provide users with access to already existing lightning wallets in a secure way?
If these services insured the users bitcoin up to a certain amount, on boarding could be improved dramatically.
Imagine Carol hears about bitcoin lightning, goes to lightning of America online and is provided with a lightning wallet instantly funded with the amount she requests. I know analogies to banks is taboo, but I feel like centralization isn't as big of a concern when talking about layer 2 protocols since the option of 'rolling your own' is always present.

@_date: 2018-05-30 05:25:40
If you think that the equal distribution of wealth equates to the decentralized nature of bitcoin, you'd be wrong.
Bitcoin is decentralized due to the way the blockchain is formed and verified. The blockchain is what gives bitcoin its security and immutability.
However, some would argue that due to its deflationary nature, the inequality of the bitcoin distribution matters less than the inequality that exists within a centralized inflationary (fiat) currency.

I don't think this means the market is arbitrary. With traditional investments this news would cause a surge in price to be sure, but bitcoins value is ultimately derived from its adoption. Not the other way around.

Its definitely a payout from nicehash. Probably related to the hack payback.
@_date: 2018-08-04 15:22:22
I think the problem with all these analyses is that they are based on traditional investments. Even this analysis.
What if I told you bitcoin market cap doesn't mean the same thing that the market cap of a stock or M1 (money supply) does? Its a completely different beast. In a sense bitcoins M1 is 2100 quadrillion with lightning network.
What happens when bitcoin is widely used compared to the dollar, and there are only 100k left to mine? Thinking rationally about this now, people won't sell for any amount of dollars. This means that the market cap could actually be nearly infinite against the dollar.
I don't pretend to say this is likely to happen any time soon, but is it a possibility? Sure it is.

People always say deflation discourages spending, and in a system where both types coexist you're probably right. I'd personally like to see a randomized double blind experiment done where both exist in isolation, and then see what happens.
And btw, my last statement is simply that some bitcoin proponents would argue it (myself included). I believe less capital flow would be beneficial to a lot of things that plague our earth. In any case I'm open to the change in trajectory a switch to crypto would bring.

Yes. Totally fair. At least it should be. Anything anyone creates should be done so with the intention of bettering humanity. If it does, you should be happy that people are improving on your idea.

This doesn't tell the whole story by itself though. Bitcoins overall price movement over time is really only represented by a few days out of the year where the gains and losses happen.

I feel like bitcoin could go into the hundreds of millions. Once big players start accepting it (Amazon, alibaba etc) there's no reason for people to trade it for fiat which will increase the value drastically. I think it could honestly go well beyond even the highest expectations.
No one has ever seen this before and likely won't again until we can do away with the concept of money altogether.
Edit: 
What will be really interesting though is what kind of price discovery happens when 1/1000 Satoshi payments are possible through lightning, and when price discovery stops being against fiat and actually happens against goods and services.
I think that it could result in a crazy dynamic where goods become cheaper year over year, but people are also paid less year over year.
This could lead society away from over indulgence, to a more sharing focused and less wasteful mindset as we collectively realize everyone should have the opportunity to be wealthy, but not at the expense of one another.

Your number is way too high. You are assuming that all the 18 million bitcoins that have been mined will somehow be evenly distributed 1 btc per person?
There are people who own tens of thousands of bitcoin themselves. In fact, looking at  you'll see that 15 million of the 18 million already mined are owned by less than one million wallets.
Being conservative, if 50 million wallets end up with 20 million bitcoin, that means 10 billion people would have to share 1 million btc.
In that world, the mean holdings by the world population would be around 10k sats.

I think most people fundamentally understand money is created out of nothing by governments, but they don't care.
The problem is that this and the resulting inflation this has caused year over year has blinded people to the pile of shit that is our current economic reality.
We're conditioning the poorest people in our society to spend as soon as they receive, and even go into debt to do so.
Why shouldn't it be the other way around? Why shouldn't the poorest people be paid in an ever appreciating asset. That way they would have a much better chance of increasing their wealth by saving their money and forgoing shiny new immediacy.

I don't think you understand me. I'm saying that because of its deflationary nature, you can only get less and less bitcoin for the same product year after year.
If bitcoin becomes mainstream, iPhones will HAVE to decrease in price (in bitcoin) every new model, or they won't sell any iPhones.
Maybe I should have said you can get more bitcoin in trades for goods and services today than you will tomorrow, and more tomorrow than the day after that and so on.

Right, I know this. But be honest with yourself, 90% of LN use will be custodial in nature for at least the next few years. It will develop like bitcoin itself has. I'm sure at least 20 % of coins in existence are currently held on exchanges.
@_date: 2019-03-03 22:30:51
You multiply the percent by the amount you're spending - .109 x 30 = 3.27. Therefore, you'll end up with 26.73 euros worth of bitcoin at whatever the exchange rate you purchase at is.
From what I've seen, those atms also gouge people on the exchange rate, so I'd expect you to get closer to 20 euros worth at the rates you see online.

Transaction on the blockchain won't be for everyone. Most people in the future will solely transact over the lightning protocol or some other layer 2 technology.
Bitcoin's (current) 7 tps limit gives it the properties that make it valuable in the first place - namely its immutability and decentralized nature. Take that away and you don't have a 10k, possibly 1 mill someday - dollar Bitcoin that continues to gain traction worldwide.
Some shitcoins will continue to do well against the dollar, but all of them will pale in comparison to Bitcoin because they fail at maintaining an immutable monetary policy and massive decentralization because they allow crazy numbers of transactions and because most are moving away from proof of work.
There will be massive fees on the base Bitcoin layer and most people WILL be priced out of transacting there unless they hold more Bitcoin than fees will cost in the future.
This is not a bug. It's a feature that is required to keep Bitcoin free. If you're confused about my use of the word 'free', you don't understand what Bitcoin truly is all about.

Here's a question for you - did you only get into bitcoin to make a quick buck or do you understand and believe in its qualities being more sound than your fiat currency of choice?
If it was to make a quick buck, sure keep your money on coinbase and sell once it goes up.
OTHERWISE it would be prudent to learn how to control your own bitcoin since any bitcoin on an exchange that you don't have the private keys for is not in your possession and can be confiscated. See Mt. Gox, Quadriga, Nicehash, etc. etc. etc.

The problem with this line of thought is that there is no end to it then. 
The thing that is most important to a cryptocurrency is its decentralization. Bitcoin wins hands down.
If you believe that doesn't matter at all, there will always be a newer 'better' coin with faster transactions and lower fees.
The problem, is that none of these solutions have the economic inventive feedback system that bitcoin has with ever more miners providing ever more security with ever more hash power in order to print bitcoin.
If any coin were to try it, it would be instantly under control due to any one party being able to 51% it as soon as it came online.

You can’t know that for sure.
If bitcoin becomes the worlds best store of value (we all know it is but I’m talking about in the collective worlds mind), value will grow alongside economic growth due to a higher value world economy, likely 1 to 1.

That's not a requirement either. Give me a good reason why hyperinflation would have to happen?
If everyone tried to trade their 100 million dollar bitcoin for fiat, the dollar value would crash proportionally to the amount trying to be sold.
The key is that as people learn about bitcoin, they make a conscious decision not to sell.
I personally think that bitcoin will be worth more than 100 million as lightning matures precisely because people WONT be trading it for fiat.

Just reposting here what I already posted in this same thread you created in the bitcoin SV sub;
Imagine being too stupid to understand that the value derived from the bitcoin network is directly related to the size of the transaction fee.
If 13 cents is too large a percentage of the value you are transacting, given all the benefits that are conferred using the medium you are transacting in, you’re right. You shouldn’t be using bitcoin. Stick with your shitcoin. But don’t cry when transaction volumes go to zero and everyone forgets about it during the next bull run.
@_date: 2019-11-25 03:39:59
You got this ass backwards. You are stupid now for thinking you could have timed the market. It could have just as easily kept rising in price at 12k and you’d be calling yourself stupid now for selling.

People are more than happy to sell off a few coins of their 10,000 coin stash every month at these prices to live off of.
My thought process is that bitcoin does its stratospheric rises when people stop selling and decide they've sold enough so they hold, or enough people have forgotten about bitcoin to be interested enough to buy (and therefore no one is selling either).
I think bitcoin starts going crazy when everyone has forgotten about it, not the other way around.
@_date: 2018-10-07 16:54:42
Your first sentence is not what he said. 
He said, 'when bitcoin inevitably hits $1 million'. Your first sentence assumes there is a correlation of price to market cap.
Why do you think market cap is a legitimate metric when talking about a currency? We don't measure the value of dollars in chickens because no one would be stupid enough to convert all their savings into chickens.
Bitcoin being valued at 1 million doesn't mean a fifth of the world's money is in it.
I really think too many people don't understand this, which is why so many people will be shocked when it hits 100 million so fast.

You have to realize that the ONLY thing that matters for a crypto is its security model. Bitcoin hands down beats everything else in that category.
Tell me who cares about a privacy coin that can be easily 51% attacked or a instant value transfer coin that has 5 nodes but they have to be stored on centralized servers because there’s too much data transferred?
People will start to realize that bitcoin wins because it has far and away the best security model, and therefore the speed and privacy will be built on top of the only one that matters.
It’s already happening on both those fronts with the lightning network.
Don’t be stupid with your money. Do your research.

Here's a real life example. I'm running a bitcoin node with lightning on top. I'm doing it on a raspberry pi.
If blocks were 8x current size and they were always full, I would need a 4 tb hdd instead of the 500 GB one I'm using. 
Verifying the block headers would also tale 16 days on an i7 instead of 1-2 days.
Big blocks prohibit people from running the software that secures the network and gives the currency value.

Wealth 'centralization' isn't anything bitcoin was created to fight against.
Its central banking institutions and their manipulation of the general populations wealth and well being by their policies of easy money printing. This allows people to collude and make even more money off of those less fortunate.
Bitcoin has a predictable distribution algorithm which prevents this. The same algorithm also requires bitcoin wallets to be distributed in wealth like you've shown.

First of all your question is incredibly vague. 
If you do the math of how many bitcoins you would need if they were all distributed equally among the world population, and then multiply that by 5 to get the top  20%, you'd arrive at the number I gave.
However, since so few people already control the 82% of coins already out there, you could argue that the number is closer to .0023

Market cap is a meaningless metric for a crypto currency.
@_date: 2018-10-05 03:18:53
What happens when there is no limit and the currency is widely used?
The very foundation of the reason why bitcoin is becoming wisely used is the fact that anyone can validate the blockchain.
In your scenario that would continue to happen until the currency becomes widely used, at which point centralized nodes would outclass everything else, and the reason why bitcoin is better than fiat would cease to exist.
@_date: 2018-10-27 16:07:36
Your last statement isn't necessarily true.
I can envision those people who lose interest being people who buy and forget about it.
If that keeps happening with every person who enters the bitcoin space, the new discoverers will drive adoption by increasing the price, and with it awareness.

You won’t make money using your computer. The most you’ll earn is probably like 20 cents per day if that, and then you’ll have the extra headache of your landlord pissed at you and likely demand you pay for utilities.
The best bet has always been to just buy bitcoin and hold it, and wait for it to appreciate in value.
What ends up happening is you will fall down the rabbit hole, and end up with the mindset that you would rather keep your bitcoin then trade them for filthy fiat money.
If you want to be kicking yourself for not just buying and holding in a few years, look into ASICS.

I think the devs working on the protocol likely factored the possibility of a hard fork into their development, and made it so that a small change would could upgrade all LN wallets to the new forked coin. 
Old channels would most likely keep the old version of the coin, and new channels would have to be created and funded with the new coin.

It's a common mistake to think that Bitcoin became popular because of free and instant transactions. Noobs often think this is the case because it's an internet currency, and therefore it must be faster than Visa, right?
Wrong. When you start to really understand Bitcoin, you realize that it's popular and growing massively in value precisely because it is the best store of value in the world due to its immutable monetary policy and security behind it.
Speedy and cheap transactions aren't the thing that needs to be solved for right now. The disruption of the current system is what Bitcoin solves for.
If you are worried about speedy, free transactions, the lightning network is growing and improving every day. There the transactions are usually &lt;1 second, and fees are usually &lt;1 Satoshi.

I'm arguing that the 'market cap' has more to do with network effects and expectations than anything else. My scenario was contrived to a small number of actors to illustrate my point, but the difference between 10 to 1000 and 10M to 1B is just a matter of the number of people interested in Bitcoin + those people's beliefs of what its true price should be.
After a halving when the reward is cut in half and therefore Bitcoin becomes twice as expensive to produce, the premium put on the price is driven by the miners. This leads to increased demand with less supply, and it drives up the price for holders. Outsiders see this and become interested and enter the space, understand what Bitcoin really is, and drives expectations of much higher prices.
This is the cycle we see playing out since 2010, and IMO won't stop until Bitcoin can no longer be purchased with fiat.

First of all the best supercomputer did the same task in 2.5 days, not 10,000 years like you claim.
Second of all, quantum computers are very quick at certain specific tasks. This could be something quantum computers  won’t ever be able to do.
Let’s say the goal was to cripple the network by destroying it’s value, and quantum computers some day were able to accomplish this. What happens then is a migration of bitcoin to use quantum resistant encryption, using a snapshot of the blockchain prior to this discovery.
The cat is out of the bag regarding Bitcoin’s decentralized value proposition. Not even quantum computers can stop it now.

This amount is constantly increasing due to the increasing liquidity of all LN channels overall. As path finding is improved upon this will increase drastically.
The LN protocol doesn't have to be inflexible at all like the underlying blockchain. This means that any feature that has merit should be able to be implemented nearly to perfection once the tech comes to term.

I don't agree with you that 10 trillion dollars has to move into Bitcoin for its market cap to reach that number.
All that has to happen IMO is for people to hold their Bitcoin until it's value rises due to supply and demand.
Let's say there's 21 people total who own Bitcoin after all of them have been mined, each with 1 million coins at present value. They all think that each Bitcoin should be worth 5 million with a 100 trillion market cap and aren't selling any to anyone under that amount.
Let's say there is still massive demand and 21 new people come forward and each buy a coin. Voila, market cap of Bitcoin is now 100 trillion with only 105 million new dollars changed hands.
People are already cashing out into fiat less and less due to the way every countries economic system is incompetently handled, so this thing I'm describing is actually already happening.
This is why market cap is a meaningless garbage metric for Bitcoin, and IMO realistically isn't any ceiling on the price.

I don't agree that USD has to be worthless for a greater than $1/Satoshi parity.
All that has to happen is a collective belief that Bitcoin will always increase in value against anything else.
If everyone started believing this, as you said, no one in their right mind would trade their Bitcoin for any amount of dollars. In this period it would also become true that everyone would accept Bitcoin as payment.
That means other currencies would have to exist in order to facilitate trade between two people who don't want to give up their Bitcoin but may accept something else in trade if the other party didn't have enough Bitcoin for payment.
I think this ecosystem is separate enough from the dollar that it may not have much impact if any on the price of the dollar.

We have a good idea that the next market dip will be due to lower interest rates (causing inflation) - since this has preceded the past two most recent recessions. Since there is a high correlation between the exchange rate of the dollar and gold, and a inflationary recession can lower the exchange rate of the dollar, it's very likely that BTC would increase in price during that period.

People don't realize that the lower the price, the more miners drop off the network causing the overall hash rate to decrease. This causes the hash power needed to mine 1 btc to drop as well, effectively increasing efficiency for everyone.
This causes an equilibrium in price to be found between the miners who are selling, the miners who aren't selling, and those who've had to get out of the game. The value could drop to 100 dollars and the network would keep functioning.

I definitely came to a similar realization once I put in the time to actually understand the technology. I never bashed it, but from the outside looking in its VERY easy to dismiss it. 
I think it's easy to dismiss it as just a highly speculative investment vehicle, or a form of internet 'play' money, or a means to conduct shady transactions.
Once you really dive into what it's all about and it clicks, that's when your mind is blown and opened up to the inevitability of it all.
The problem is, most people don't want to have to open their eyes because it's scary and unfamiliar and difficult.
Sometimes I wonder what percentage of people have really come to understand the tech, but still decide that it's not worth investing in.

.003 is the *average* if all BTC was distributed equally. 18 million have already been mined. There's likely only a few million people at this point with more than 1 btc, and it's probable that by the time 99% of bitcoin has been released there will still be 90% left of the people on this planet that have not bought any BTC.
What's 210,000 / 7,200,000,000 ? - That's closer to the *mean,* which is likely a better metric that is based on actual real world distribution based on how trends and technologies are adopted.

This just is speculation. There is no rule that this has to be the case.
Has fiat hyper inflated since bitcoin was less than a dollar? It has inflated, yes - but coffee has always been about $5 during that whole time.
People need to realize that market cap for a currency is a worthless metric. 
Bitcoin could have a 100,000,000,000,000 market cap without affecting the dollar. All that means is that people would rather trade with bitcoin than with the dollar.

The minute Bitcoin’s cryptography is broken by a quantum computer or otherwise, the encryption for all servers and services on the internet is also broken.

Your praise for debt is purely due to it being a product of the current system.
Changing the system could very possibly deprecate debt entirely.

IMO debt (and the current economic system) is responsible. I'm not going to explain why I think that as that would make this post very long and I'm sure cause a lot of disagreement.
However, Bitcoin could easily turn this system on its head by reversing the fundamental property of all fiat money - its propensity for inflation.

First of all, I don’t want to let this discussion overshadow the fact that if that becomes the norm with quantum computers,   then all the data that is currently on the internet, including the balance sheets of large banks, is at risk to a greater degree than bitcoin as I’ve already stated.
The reason for this is that everyone who has a financial incentive to improve bitcoin will upgrade the protocol to something like a post quantum lattice based cryptographic system.
But back to your answer- no one knows how long it would take a quantum computer sufficiently programmed to crack a bitcoin private key. Your ‘very very fast’ is true in the context of traditional computing, but a thousand years is still not something I would worry about :)

No. The point of running a node is to be able to transact on the network.

I don't agree.
If the same number of people who bought bitcoin in the past continue to buy bitcoin and hold it, no new players have to enter the game for the price to rise drastically.
The price change over time in the positive is what will drive adoption more than anything else, regardless of the difficulty in on boarding.

This is how bitcoin leads the transition of society into a new value paradigm.
People won't be as willing to use bitcoin to buy shit that breaks, or they don't need, or the company making that product has bad customer service.
They won't be willing because their bitcoin today may be worth ten percent more tomorrow.
What they will do is only purchase products from companies with stellar customer service, who do anything for their customers, and would likely replace a broken unit immediately, no questions asked, free of charge.
Why would a business behave in this way you might ask?
Because to them, the purchase of anything today, and the prospect of the customer returning to buy something again in the future, is worth not having a bad reputation.
A shit company in the bitcoin world would die much faster than the same one in a fiat world imo.

The blockchain is a distributed database of all the coins that currently exist and where they exist (what public key can be used to identify their owner).

A large constriction in volume will set the price imo, not the volume of cash being added to the asset class as a whole.
I've been saying this for a long time now - market cap in terms of a currency is a meaningless statistic.
In my opinion, market cap could reach into the hundreds of trillions without affecting global economies too much if at all.

When you are withdrawing your funds from lntip bot, you are asking a service to pay you.
If you were transferring directly from one wallet to another, it would be instant.
Since you are transferring from a service to your wallet, there are any number of reasons why that service may fail, including it just being shut down randomly.
I doubt that's what has happened here, but you get the point.
@_date: 2019-02-25 05:57:19
Well lets think about it. Would this change the attack vector for the network? I believe so.
Lets say a bad actor who wants to abolish bitcoin has 100k bitcoins to fuck around with.
They then decide to send these coins back and forth between their own wallets and flood the network with these spam transactions. This could create 100 mb blocks. In a day we could see 14.4 GB added to the blockchain. After a month of this the blockchain is twice the size of what bitcoins is after 10 years.
At that point only institutions would be able to run nodes.

@_date: 2019-02-23 17:48:42
While lightning network fees are approaching 0 and will likely forever stay that way.
Honestly, with the soundness of the money system that bitcoin is, I'm happy to pay high on-chain fees if needed.
So many people think bitcoin was made for instant fee-less transactions, but that simply isn't true.
It's primary feature (and why it works so well) is its deflationary nature in the face of the rampant inflation happening all over the world.
Bitcoins base layer will soon transition from a payment network to primarily be a way to securely store the most valuable asset in existence. It will serve that purpose, as well as an on and off ramp onto lightning.
@_date: 2019-12-21 07:27:15
Not gonna happen. It’s a slippery slope in both directions. It’s staying the size it is now but transaction volume will increase within that limit with technological improvements.
The lightning network is one such improvement.
If over time when the block reward becomes too small and we come to find the fees aren’t enough, we can have this discussion then.
It’s too early to have this discussion now.

The one thing I'd keep in mind though is that it's probably a good idea to change your seed when you get your new wallet. Just in case somehow someone was able to guess your pin.

I feel like there are two levels of understanding of Bitcoin.
1.	It's a way to make $$
2.	It will change the world as we know it
If you haven't made it past  the decision to sell its based purely on not wanting to lose a certain amount of dollar value equivalent that you've made on your investment.
I'm of the opinion that some people get to  before they lose any portion of their Bitcoin. For a lot of people (including this guy), they'll get to  only after they lose a portion of their coins. A smaller, but present minority, will be burnt by losing out enough to exit the game entirely - but I think 99% of people keep at least 1 foot in at all times after learning about it.

The lightning network consists of a topology where any node can open a channel with any other node. What you're suggesting is to artificially limit that capacity somehow, which doesn't make any sense.
@_date: 2019-02-01 16:58:51
I envision a hub of businesses linked together where there will be more than enough routing capacity as long as individuals are connected to one of those entities.
The businesses that then have the most customers will win the amalgamation of the negligible user routing fees, which in total will be substantial.
This will cause businesses to offer better incentives to route your transactions through them through using established third party wallets that offer rewards.
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:25:45
I had some pretty good equipment back then too...
@_date: 2019-02-22 07:04:17
1.	Lightning is onion routed so illegal transactions cannot be traced.
2.	Tax is easily calculated by keeping an internal record of each transaction, which is the case for all businesses in operation today anyway
Again, you are describing a neutered version of LN that has large downsides with very little (if any) benefit. I don't think it's a good idea, nor do I think it makes much sense, but I could be wrong.

@_date: 2019-12-26 15:49:49
@_date: 2019-02-11 05:19:35
The reason why bitcoin can stay decentralized is because of the properties of the blockchain. The size of the blocks and the intervals in which they are confirmed are inversely proportional to the number of nodes that can exist to strengthen the network.
Yes, currently the amount of transactions per second is 7 with bitcoin, and increasing the size of the blocks will allow many more transactions. However the cost of this is exponentially fewer nodes verifying transactions, and thus the ability to 51% attack the network becomes vastly easier.

IMO it would be foolish to sell more than a fraction of your holdings at that point since we all believe the fundamentals behind bitcoin will allow it to always gain value over the dollar.

lol, I have plenty of value tied up in channels on LN and it works flawlessly.
Maybe if you hadn’t traded all your real bitcoin for bcash you could’ve tried it too.
Big blocks break the economic incentives that bitcoin thrives on. Therefore base later scaling doesn’t work by just increasing the block size. Sure it may today or tomorrow, but that’s being incredibly short sighted.
Bcashers love to parrot that bitcoin fans are ‘irresponsible’ in deploying a second layer solution like LN, however the real irresponsibility is bcashers not factoring the security and economics of small blocks into their decision making process.
It shows which one is winning by the price, development, hash rate and by a ton of other metrics.
You’re on a sinking ship buddy, and (sadly?) you’re probably gonna be happy going down with it.

The big thing to keep in mind is that any exchange can shut down, and take your bitcoin with them if you've left it on their platform. Research bitcoin wallets where you can access your own keys (electrum for PC/mac, Green by blockstream for iOS, wasabi or samourai for android) and learn how to back up your keys. Then send your bitcoin to your own wallet for safe keeping.
@_date: 2019-12-26 16:15:10
I disagree with you because I don’t think you’re connecting all the dots here, and you’re using the term ‘bloodshed’ to describe these protests where the vast majority of the protestors are acting peacefully.
IF bitcoin were to become the world reserve currency (admittedly a huge if) governments would not have the power to do any of the things that you mentioned that ultimately is causing these protests.
Many people in this sub can see a way to that future, but it does take some mental leaps that are in no way a given.
That does seem to be the end goal for most of the believers in this technology though, aside from all the day traders and speculators who understand little to none about the actual disruption that bitcoin could cause.

I think the amount being lost is relative to the value. If 4 million have been lost up till today, and the price increases tenfold, I’d wager that the maximum amount lost in that period would be 400k.
I’m just saying there’s an upper bound of lost bitcoin that we’re heading asymptotically towards.

I don’t think there is an inherent ‘quality’ that memes possess. This is a meme, and my observation was to only state how I felt as an uninitiated Bitcoiner when I first saw one similar to this.
I think the problem is these things are largely created as a simple introduction to the space, but simple introductions to complex topics lead most people to take the content of said introductions at face value.
Sure it’s great for people who already ‘get it’, but those people aren’t really the target audience for something like this, are they?
@_date: 2019-02-07 20:25:52
Haha they mention 'an enormous coordinated effort' to put this e-money system into place.
I wonder why the e-money of old never worked out..... Could it be that the double-spend problem was only a problem because the users could themselves inflate the supply?
Double-spend is called 'inflation' when only those running the show are allowed to do it.
It should be no surprise that both are toxic to a currency, only with inflation it happens over a longer time horizon.

Your seed phrase corresponds to a specific address on the blockchain where your coins reside. You can't change the address where they are without actually sending those bitcoin somewhere else.
You would have to create a new wallet with a different seed, then send those bitcoin there.
It also looks like you might be getting scammed into using bitcoin cash instead of bitcoin. Be careful out there...

Bitcoin is all about individual sovereignty over ones own wealth.
If at any point you take that out of the equation, you are literally going against everything bitcoin stands for.
This is why people get scammed.
This is why people initially distrust anything bitcoin related.
This is why it shouldn't be done.
People will realize they have to adapt or be left behind. Most will eventually and that's great, some won't and that's ok. What isn't ok is forcing bitcoin to be something that it was never designed or intended to be - another way for institutions to have control over individuals.

No we can't agree, because the dollars that it *does* cost goes to securing the network. There's a reason why Bitcoin is the most used and trusted cryptocurrency in the world, and I think we should do everything we can to keep it that way, otherwise everything else is moot.

Absolutely in no way is this wrong. I can easily host an LN node, create a web wallet, and update your balance with the new amount of 'your' bitcoin any time you send or receive. 
I can abscond with all the funds by disconnecting the user portion, or, given enough users and getting a trend of their spending habits, I can keep talking satoshis out of the pool to spend on something else while you still think you have a full balance.
Not saying that I would do any of that, but saying "Wrong." without doing any critical thinking of your own is pretty bad man.

So good. Thanks for posting this.
I do think the examples around 23:30 don't actually touch upon the disruption that the host was making moments earlier since it's the government trying to push back against established corporations that have created "disruptive" gig economies, which is not the same as decentralization.
Maybe I haven't watched enough of it yet, but I think a more striking example would be what governments are doing to stop Bitcoin, Tor, and other truly decentralized networks from their operations. Which would obviously be nothing since they can't be stopped without shutting down the internet.

They're part of some 'puzzle' likely created by the LBC creators themselves to generate interest in a proof of concept project.
If you look at their site, they're searching from a pool of 32487405889012096286998939040 TRILLION private keys, and so far since the project's inception they have looked through 36539 trillion.

I would define it by the number of full validation nodes running.
As long as the nodes are verifying the validity of blocks and transactions, the system can't be gamed.
The catch-22 there, is that there won't be many nodes until a system is proven to be valuable enough to warrant them, but the system won't be valuable until there are many nodes.
Right now, speculation is rampant in the crypto world, and so there is a lot of value being transferred to networks without a strong infrastructure.
I have a feeling that people are going to start seeing bitcoin leaving most other crypto in the dust (aside from a few others) which will trigger a huge sell off for all but the most secured currencies.

I’m a bitcoin maximalist because I understand that the economic incentives to keep the bitcoin blockchain and it’s economic rules the most secure, blocks have to be small and miners have to get PAID for their work through transaction fees.
Lighting extends these economic incentives to a system that makes the most valuable decentralized currency the fastest, and the cheapest settlement layer known to man.

My point is that past a certain threshold, people will stop selling one thing for another entirely. Doesn't matter if that thing is cattle, wampum beads, pieces of paper, or dog shit.
I'm of the opinion that day by day, week by week, month by month... Bitcoin will be realized as the hardest, safest, most valuable form of trade the world has ever seen. To use that in exchange for anything but the most desired products or services (of varying origin not available on exchanges, and highly tailored to the individuals wants) would be just plain stupid.

The problem is that if there is no paper trail of payment, but there is a paper trail of services rendered by him, he would have legal recourse to sue.
In this case the amount isn't really enough for that to happen, but in the future I would suggest getting a text from the contractor with his exact bitcoin address is and what services you're paying for. This way everything can be verified if need be.

@_date: 2018-03-24 19:14:06
It cannot be traced. There is no way to determine how many hops your payment took and if it went into that wallet or another connected wallet 10 hops away.
When the balance is settled on the blockchain by you closing your channel or the other party closing theirs, the only thing that is shown is the updated balance to your wallet.

Blockchain exists in many different currencies. The security of the blockchain in question depends on the number of nodes and miners which is shown by the hash rate contributed to the network. Bitcoins hash rate is orders of magnitude larger than any other POW coin.

The attack vector could really only be aimed at one channel at a time. I've looked at it a bunch of ways and while you can lose money through unexpected closing of channels right now (say with a corruption of your LN node data), once watchtowers are in place it's a pretty bulletproof system.

I agree with this, but I also think the end game is just as inevitable as bitcoin becoming the most important monetary system that has ever existed.
People will continue to be stupid as people do, and there will be a time when people will realize that having kept bitcoin on an exchange was a bad idea.
Just as there is an ever growing subset of the population that believes in bitcoin long term and holds it as a means to transact with it in the future, there exists an ever growing subset of people who begin to realize holding their own keys is what bitcoin is all about.
I do think the liquidity that exchanges provide (the ability to allow for instant trades) does cause the price discovery to happen quicker. Therefore as time progresses forwards, and the amount of tradable bitcoin decreases, more and more people will see it as the most important financial system (being a finite, but instantly tradable unit of account), and therefore the price will rise.
My argument would be - the only reason to care about the price for the people who think like we do, is in the short term for the purpose of accumulation. In the end, the price of bitcoin against the dollar, or any other currency won't matter a lick, since it will be the best facilitator of exchange by a wide margin. Embrace the fact that bitcoin is 80% off it's highs, and embrace it if it falls another 80% from its current position.

Don't fool yourself by saying it couldn't happen. If a $1200 bitcoin would hurt you, you need to re-evaluate why you are in the game in the first place.
I'm in it for the long term, so I'm not selling at $1200 or $1000000. Basically I'm just not selling ever. So I'd be more than happy with a price that low.

Yeah it might be hurting the value of bitcoin against the dollar because the sellers are pushing the price down, but holding increases the value of bitcoin dramatically during bull runs.
Value is subjective and as long as people are adopting and buying bitcoin for things other than just a speculative investment, it will contribute to ultimate price discovery. Maybe not in the current market, but in the bull markets to come.

No one seems to be giving you an answer to your initial question besides to not store your bitcoin on an exchange like coinbase. While good advice, they aren't really answering your question.
What it sounds like happened -
The waiter was wrong. First of all coinbase will NOT be blocked from sending to ANY bitcoin address as long as you put in an address and not an email.
You checked the block explorer which was good, but you checked it too late. Some wallets will not see an incoming transaction until there is at least one confirmation, which usually takes around 10 minutes but could take up to an hour.
The waiter likely did not know this, only that if the fee is set too low, the transaction will sit in the mempool for a while and ultimately be returned if it is cleared out before network fees are low enough to send it.
He either knows too little about bitcoin to want to humor you for long or you were taken advantage of.
I would go back to the restaurant, get their bitcoin address again, double check the receiving address is correct on blockchain.com, then tell them you want a cash refund, or better yet have them send you the bitcoin back and teach them what I've told you.
At least that way they can't disillusion any more people trying to pay with bitcoin.

1.	If you know that little about how wallets work, you don't know enough about bitcoin to make an educated assessment about this. Really what you're doing here is providing an opinion that is not based on any objectivity. Everyone should understand that there are always smarter people out there than themselves. One should not see this as an affront to their ingrained beliefs and use it as an excuse to harden those beliefs, but as an opportunity to learn. I think you absolutely need to do some more research.
2.	You could never create a cryptocurrency with a stable value against the dollar, unless you are pegging that currency directly to the dollar, in which case it would have the same faults as the dollar and never work as a successful cryptocurrency.

I'll humor you though and try to put it in a way you might understand -
If you truly wanted to change the world, and know the steps needed to accomplish that goal, why would you ever take a step backwards?
My 'long term' is forever. I'll sell my bitcoin for goods and services that I need, not for fiat.
@_date: 2019-01-17 21:19:23
I think it's inevitable. You can do a shit ton of things with programmable money that you can't do in the current fiat financial system.
The people who are in it for the tech will always hold, dreaming of bigger and better applications for their money.
Those who are in it to get rich may sell some, but it's likely that through research, they will get a hint of the technological developments that bitcoin enables and either keep a modest amount, or end up buying back in in the future.
Yes people will sell some in order to cover fiat obligations or have some fiat safety net, but I believe this is a fraction of most peoples holdings.
I also think this is why we never see bitcoin bottom below the previous bottom level.
This premise ENSURES that bitcoin will always and consistently gain value against the dollar given a long enough time frame and barring any huge bug in the system. And we all know price can drive adoption in the same way adoption can drive price.

I watched the rest and he makes good points that really only make much sense if we assume the technology and adoption don't improve in the future. Yes being connected will be a requirement, but that doesn't mean on chain transactions can't happen when that's the case.
Right now the development requirements are super high because it's such a new technology. The devs are requesting people not use it on mainnet but people are curious and are doing it anyway (myself included). A lot of these people are causing unnecessary headache by asking questions for the devs that aren't directly related to the workings of the network itself, but rather how to interface with it properly. The devs are not concentrating on those problems right now because the improvements there can be done when the network functions themselves are fully tested.
Scaling on chain transactions is bad because it increases centralization. If BCH were ever to become as heavily utilized as bitcoin, node size would exceed the gigabyte range that bitcoin is currently in very quickly, and eventually cause an exponential rise in node disk capacity and therefore network connection speed requirements.

@_date: 2019-01-03 07:07:13
I see people saying this like it would actually happen in a situation where bitcoin becomes a dominant world currency, but I don't see that happening. The compounding nature of the ever-inflating dollar and the deflationary nature of bitcoin would ensure ever growing demand for bitcoin and ever waning demand for the dollar. This will result in an ever increasing value of bitcoin against the dollar until the dollar itself completely disappears.
This isn't a happy coexistence.... Its a bitcoin eats all scenario.

I went in with an open mind ready to hear his criticisms, but his first point is already assuming a lot. Why is he using coinbase as an example of having to send from a non LN to an LN address? Once lightning starts to scale there are going to obviously be exchanges with funds available on the lightning network itself. People can purchase bitcoin entirely on LN.
Also, who cares if people have to fund their own LN wallets every once in a while? This will mean two things - those transactions will be cheap with low confirmation times, and that will be due to heavily decreased network congestion.
Ugh.... I guess I'll watch the rest of the video now..

Bitcoin is the revolution. Alt coins are a distraction.
The MOST important attribute of why bitcoin became big in the first place is decentralization.
This seems to have been completely lost on the alt coin crowd.
Having first mover advantage and proof of work means that bitcoin will always be the most decentralized and secure payment network.
Lightning just now combines those properties with the speed and low fees to allow bitcoin to grow into a full fledged currency, not 'just' the greatest store of value in the universe.
Watch out because if you're not paying attention you might miss the revolution.

Oh I do, I guess it's just not a concern for people who truly believe in second layer solutions.
@_date: 2019-01-12 17:41:55
I agree in part.
I think the real issue is that people look away when it's presented as 'a new type of money'.
Instinct takes over and people think that means that it would never reach the critical mass needed to change our monetary system as a whole, and so they immediately write it off.
What they fail to see though is the deeper layer - the controlled supply, peer to peer nature, and developer ingenuity that will, in my opinion, continue to strengthen the resolve of current holders, which in turn will keep the price continually rising.
People who understand bitcoin understand that price can drive adoption just as easily as adoption drives price and ultimately don't care much about the Hodl meme, but they have to understand bitcoin first in order to make that judgement (in most cases).

The centralization of large blocks is commonly used as the excuse for why BTC &gt; BCH. The real issue is the large block guys decided to use their development time to increase the block size and have a hard fork on bitcoin core development.
In contrast, the BTC team has been working on real scaling solutions, like Segwit and lightning, that BCH has no response to other than 'its ruining everything bitcoin stands for!' without taking the time to actually learn about why it's necessary.

Just FYI you can create a wallet with your Trezor, make sure to write down the seed, then generate an address and write that down. Then wipe the Trezor, restore from your old seed, and send funds to new address. Then when you restore from your new seed your funds should be there.

Tell me why exactly this would be unsustainable? What are you measuring economic growth by? Why should saved assets depreciate over time? Too many people assume they have all the answers. The only answer is that human civilization has never seen anything like this before, and therefore it cannot be compared to previous models. Any one who does so is merely formulating a hypothesis about what might happen in the future.
@_date: 2018-02-04 03:52:14
Well lets just imagine every single transaction ever made in history between anyone in the world. If the blockchain has to record every single one of these transactions individually, you can see how the size of the blocks and therefore the blockchain would have to increase to a ridiculous size in order to handle that. 
Now imagine within a year or two, in order to verify the blockchain (to become a node) you have to first download a terabyte of data. Depending upon adoption rates and transaction volume, you could see how this might become petabytes of data down the line.
Even with large blocks the transactions per second can never reach the billions of transactions per day that LN can theoretically achieve.

So in addition to the responses that correctly mention anywhere from a couple minutes to a couple days, the lightning network, a new protocol that is utilized for bitcoin on top of the blockchain that I have personally used, promises to process millions of transactions per second.

The phrase that you use when initializing the Trezor is what you would use. 
The device itself is just a way to interpret those words into the private address that accesses your coins.
In 10 years if bitcoin is worth enough for you to be worried about this, Trezor and other companies will exist (as well as wallet apps) that will let you access it.
Right now you can download 50 apps on your phone and plug your phrase into them and recover your coins.

2.	 What is the incentive for having distributed records of any information that already works perfectly fine on centralized servers?
3.	 Decentralization works when the blockchain is small. Information added to a blockchain of anything more than transaction data would be prohibitively centralizing, no?

You're confusing price with hash rate. The price might be $100, but there still may be tens of thousands of miners contributing.
I think that there are many operators out there with no qualms about keeping their operation going no matter the cost. People have access to farms operating on free renewable energy for which the miners have been largely paid off, whose interests are much more aligned with keeping the network strong because they own thousands of BTC.
For them, the opportunity cost of keeping their miners on far outweighs the immediate gain of selling equipment nobody wants any more.

So right now every 10 minutes a block in mined, and subsequently the transactions within that block are confirmed.
The reward for mining the block is 12.5 bitcoin, which again happens every 10 minutes and is the only source of brand new bitcoins into the blockchain record.
Every 3/4 years this amount decreases by 50%, leading to only 6.25 BTC mined every 10 minutes. This has in the past correlated with a massive run up in value of BTC/$.

Inflation does. That's what loaning and bank lending contribute to.
What does inflation cause?
A decrease in value of the monetary medium against goods and services.
Bitcoin being the exact opposite of that system in principal (deflationary), means that it will continue to gain in value relative to the dollar.
Like I said, this change isn't happening overnight. Not everyone will care to understand what Bitcoin is even when it hits 100k, 1m, or even 10m to 100m, but you can bet your as that it will happen precisely due to your observation of the human condition -

Best case scenario - you take this as a lesson that there's no such thing as a free lunch, but also you head my advice to learn about Bitcoin and what actually makes it great.

I haven't audited his sources so I can't comment as to the validity of his data. However, I think his conclusions are sound. If the records do indeed present as he claims, those could be of much use to you to help build your argument.
The whole paper is a thesis on why he believes bitcoin will become the next mode of transaction favored over the dollar. At the very least I would expect this to help you explain how bitcoin IS a threat to the current fiat model.
@_date: 2019-09-16 01:48:28
On your second point - this is the thing people never seem to get. The same amount of Bitcoin will be introduced into the system every ten minutes, regardless of if there are 10 people using the network, or 10,000,000,000.
That means that the value of the network is in HOW it works, not in the number of people that care to use it. The amount of people drawn to Bitcoin helps with network effects and bringing fiat in, but it's not the driving factor.
@_date: 2018-07-18 14:36:30
There are very large mining pools that contribute to the network hash rate (mining power). These pools split up the block reward between all the miners within the pool.
No one entity is getting the whole 75 bitcoin, nor even close to 1/10 of it I'm sure.

You have to open a channel first, which technically isn't spending anything. What wallet are you using?
@_date: 2018-07-07 15:43:10
It very much depends on your power cost. Do all your calculations with your kW/h in mind.
Next, determine at what price you'd need to shut the miner off and purchase instead. Is it possible that could be the price for months or even years?
Finally, and I think this is the biggest reason for plunging your money into the asset directly right now, know that bitcoins best gains throughout the year happen in a time span of 10 days. This means that if this 10 day period comes before you can recoup your total miner + electricity costs, you'd be much, much better off having put your money into the asset directly now.

You don't seem to understand what the 'longest chain' means in practice. 
There is no single machine with the longest chain. All validating nodes on the network have the longest chain (think tens of thousands of machines).
Many of these machines are running encrypted over tor, and are using security measures that would make them very difficult to infiltrate one at a time, let alone all of them at once.
Even if an attacker managed to pull off this impossibility, any irregularities in transactions would likely be noticed immediately, and the exploit would be patched.
The Ledger cannot be destroyed because there are too many copies of it all around the world. Anyone could check their copy for the point at which the attack occurred, and start a diverging chain from that point, and as long as there is consensus, Bitcoin is safe.
The thing you have to question, is what happens when this occurs on another crypto chain that isn't Bitcoin. The answer for any of them is much less clear than it is for Bitcoin, because those validating protocols aren't being run by nearly as many people. In some cases, because blocks may be so big, only one central server (or very few people) is storing all the transactions.
@_date: 2018-07-06 15:06:00

@_date: 2018-07-13 18:34:56
All I'm saying is that there are a lot of already very wealthy people in terms of fiat who have a vested interest in seeing bitcoin succeed. Most of these same people are already operating at a 100% net loss because they are holding all of their created bitcoin.
The power of the network to transmit value trustlessly with no third party is more important to these people than the value going to $100 or even $1, and therefore they will continue to operate at a loss.
Personally, I don't think bitcoin can ever drop to that amount, but I don't think there would be a problem even if it did.
@_date: 2019-09-25 23:11:30
Was this a communal computer?
If not, it sounds like the basis for a lot of scams. You try to withdraw the Bitcoin to your own wallet and they ask for you to deposit more first, and then they never send you anything.

People have to slowly be indoctrinated into the world of sound money. 
Loans should not occur, and savings + monetary deflation, along with a known deflationary schedule should allow people to eventually purchase what they need and want.
This is an idea that's hard to grasp, but once you understand the Austrian economics that are central to the Bitcoin protocol, it makes perfect sense.
Bitcoin will change humanity for the better, but it will take some time.

I honestly don't see it going below 4-5k at this point. If you are long, I think it makes more sense to get in now and risk a 50% opportunity cost of getting in a bit later if it falls to 3k vs. missing out on the 10 days per year where you potentially miss the boat on 1000% gains.

Oh I guess I didn't completely understand your question then.
Running a node using a dish would still potentially open an attack vector that you wouldn't need to open. I think you can use electrum on Linux to sign transactions and then broadcast the transaction from a separate online machine.

Nobody is getting a $10M credit line today without proving they already have the capital to pay it back.
I'm of the opinion that businesses should build out incrementally when they can afford to, not when they want to speculate on whether a good idea may pan out our not.
The latter leads to waste and making society poorer through inflationary money printing. The former breeds a system in which many small changes are tried and tested to make sure an idea is viable before it's implementation.
If you don't understand Bitcoin at the level of a radical new economic system destined to take over as the backbone of societal wealth transfer, I would venture to say you haven't yet understood it.
@_date: 2018-04-09 05:15:48
Like I said in a previous thread, an altcoin to bitcoin requires that it uses another blockchain. When settling lightning balances, does bitcoin use the bitcoin blockchain?

Right, but whose to say people in the future wouldn't find value in trading 100 dollars for 100 sats? At some point however, buying sats with any amount of dollars would be impossible since most people would be priced out of even buying the minimum possible amount of bitcoin. I.e: 1 sat costing ten thousand dollars.
This isn't out of the realm of what could happen with bitcoin if people continue to hold and not spend or trade their coins. I think it's actually an eventuality if bitcoin does become as useful as a currency as some see it becoming.

I don't think you understand the end goal. Most people here are excited about a deflationary decentralized currency and the benefits that would bring if it was adopted by the world.
Think about saving actually increasing the value you own and what that might mean for the world. 
I'll give you one of my favorite theory - because of the last fact I mentioned, humans start to become a much less wasteful species and we realize that every interaction has a current cost associated with it, and therefore decide to forego current wants for what could be gained in the future.
I, for one, see this as a potentially huge boon for our global civilization.

Its a layer on top of the blockchain. If you have an open channel and are willing to sell goods or services for 1/1000 of a Satoshi you can do so. These denominations are not applicable on the bitcoin blockchain though so if you need to settle on the base layer, the Satoshi will be rounded down.
In a future where almost all bitcoin transactions are taking place on the lightning network, millisatoshi payments can be valid and verified trustlessly.

If bitcoin hits 1 million a coin there's no way it slows in growth compared to the dollar. I see people posting this a lot but I don't agree.
If we get to 1 million per bitcoin, the devaluation of the dollar will be staggering, and I feel like we'd see a positive feedback loop of bitcoin value increase vs dollar value decrease until it doesn't make sense to value a bitcoin in dollars anymore.

I transfer immediately after purchase. If you leave your money in an exchange account it can be taken from you if in a number of different ways.
Bitcoin was created for the specific purpose to reduce risk to individuals due to bunk economic policy, but has the side effect of also teaching people what true ownership of a digital asset means.
How can you feel safe with the knowledge of what happened to Mt. Gox, Quadriga, Nicehash etc...
Plus, if you are investing for the long term, moving your coins off the exchange will require coinbase to give you REAL bitcoin (again right now you own nothing), which will help to cause the value of bitcoin to rise.

Transaction fees are hugely important if not THE reason for bitcoins success. At some point in the near future they will surpass the block reward itself.
It will not be, nor should it be cheap to transact on the most secure, immutable ledger the world has ever seen.
People will absolutely move to LN as they should. It works great and will improve much faster than the bitcoin protocol ever could because of its different, but still decentralized properties.
Some may not like it, but it will be true that most will transact through LN without ever touching the base blockchain. The reason? The base layer being the most secure and immutable ledger the world has ever seen - due to transaction fees constantly adding new hashpower to the network.

Any app that you use to purchase bitcoin is an exchange, and there aren’t any of those that I know of that give you access to your private keys.
You’ll need to buy on the app, then send the bitcoin to a wallet that does allow you to control your keys. Samourai for Android and Green by blockstream for iOS is a good start. Start off with sending small amounts first to get the hang of it.
The 12 or 24 word seed that these wallets give you is all you need to access the bitcoin that is sent there. Write it down and keep it in a safe place.
Most importantly, keep learning and understanding what sets bitcoin apart and how it works. That is really the most valuable lesson you could learn.

You would make 14.2% on any bitcoin you sell. But you’ll also lose your shirt with trades like that based on your lack of basic math skills.

If you have the private key for the wallet, deleting and uninstalling won’t do anything even if you have bitcoin in the wallet.
The thing to understand is that the private key allows you to access the coins on the blockchain at the address where they are stored.
Deleting a wallet will never delete your coins as long as you have the private key. If you didn’t, they would just become inaccessible, or ‘lost’ forever once you deleted the wallet.
@_date: 2019-05-13 01:44:13
People will continue to sell when they can’t trade bitcoin directly for the things they want or need.
It’s just the cycle. It will continue likely until 2032 when 99 % of all BTC is in circulation, and the steady and constant rise against the dollar can no longer be ignored by the mom and pop shop keepers.

It sounds like all you want to do is gamble. Is that what you mean? Take profits from your bitcoin gains and invest in altcoins? 
If that’s the plan, sure you can do it that way. If you think you’d be able to buy more bitcoin with the profits that doesn’t make sense unless you think you can time the market, which again is a gamble.
I would suggest learning more about what bitcoin is and why it is becoming so popular. Maybe then you’ll rethink your strategy ;)

In my opinion, you’re dead wrong. BTC market dominance has been on an upward trend since the last altcoin fever.
The difference now, is that more people are taking the time to understand what sets bitcoin apart. People aren’t going to be pulling their money out of the best store of value the world has ever seen to invest in some shitcoin with a ‘revolutionary new idea’.
Bitcoin already was and is that idea, and it’s working fantastically well. The LN will see massive adoption in the years ahead, and BTC dominance will hover around 90% until 2140.

I think this highlights one of the better things about bitcoin though. 
Smart people will move their bitcoin off exchanges because they understand the benefits, while people looking to day trade will deal in paper bitcoin. This will artificially suppress the price of bitcoin while the smart money accumulates the real thing. 
I think the meteoric rise of bitcoin value against fiat actually happens when people stop trading them on paper, move them to cold storage, and wind up reducing the supply.

You can send bitcoin from person to person right now but it's slow and clunky and expensive. 
You can now put that bitcoin 'in the cloud' where you can no longer send it the old way. However, now you can send it almost instantly, even fractions of a Satoshi at a time, for fees that average less than one Satoshi per transaction.
If you want to go back to using the old system, just send your bitcoin back to the ground from the lightning 'cloud'. Beware, moving bitcoin in and out of this 'cloud' has all the drawbacks of regular bitcoin transactions.
@_date: 2018-12-10 06:52:03
I don't agree with your statement that 'bitcoin is a highly speculative asset in the minds of most people'. I actually think that the people who are in the game are the ones who have allowed it to go from pennies to thousands of dollars in fiat value, and those people view fiat as the more speculative asset.
My personal opinion is that this are the periods that bitcoin was created for. The price on the exchanges may show the fiat value decreasing, but remember - this is only due to weak hands selling. If the overall number of people buying are holding long-term, those coins are effectively not included in the pricing of the asset.
I think the next bull run will be 100x if it starts to happen in a recession vs the standard 20-30x if it were to happen today.

You can't have debt in the first place with crypto. Loaning out crypto with the intention of getting paid back is a bad idea because it's likely with deflation that you wouldn't get paid back.

There should be a withdraw button in the cash app where you paste your receive address generated from samurai wallet. 
I have heard that for newer customers, the withdrawal button doesn’t work, which is scary if you want to truly own the bitcoin. If there are any issues with their liquidity, you might be screwed. 
If that’s the case I would sell and buy back on another platform where you can transfer out.

Ok good. Just looking out for ya ��
Don’t worry that you don’t understand everything yet, there are so many areas that bitcoin touches - Austrian economics, software development, psychology, government economic policy etc.
I would start off by learning about inflation vs. deflation, then move on to what it means to own your own bitcoin keys (extremely important because exchanges can be hacked and bitcoin itself can’t).
Good luck and Godspeed!

No, bitcoin itself is the deflationary (profitable) asset. What we need is a way to route payments at virtually no cost, instantly (for every day in-person purchases at Starbucks or the mall for example).
The bitcoin blockchain fails at this, but it's where the lightning network shines.
The LN should absolutely NOT be profitable for the average guy. Its really the point of the whole thing.

Yes the pi can run bitcoin core and LND on top. Keep in mind you'll need an external drive to store the bitcoin blockchain.
As far as other alt coins go, I'm not sure why you'd want to use a pi unless you need to contribute to the network of those coins in some way. Otherwise just use the wallet that they recommend.

Its in the guide on the bitcoin step, but basically you just need to create a bitcoin directory on the drive and only copy the blocks and chainstate folders into that directory.
Then when you have mounted the drive and start the bitcoin core daemon it will sync pretty quickly (minutes instead of weeks)

I'm telling you you're absolutely never going to make money hosting a lightning node.
Not trying to crush your spirits, I just want you to have a realistic expectation of what lightning is and isn't.
I agree it absolutely will grow enormously in the coming years, however the way it is implemented is quite the opposite of the fee structure for miners on the base bitcoin blockchain.
On the blockchain, people vie for the inclusion of their transaction in the next block, and since only so many transactions can fit in a block, the ones providing the highest fees are added first.
On the lightning network there is no such competition for payers. There is competition of nodes to have the lowest possible fees (which can be 0 to 1/1000 of a Satoshi at the lowest). 
I've had a node since January and I've made maybe a few satoshis?
I hope this doesn't dampen your excitement for the network as a whole - once I started sending single satoshis at a time from the grocery store using my RPC lightning node my mind was blown.
I'm particularly excited for 5g cellphones as well since this will allow full syncing of the bitcoin blockchain and lightning node setup in a matter of minutes with the click of a button.
@_date: 2019-05-05 17:40:28
You’re right, but telling people to avoid it because of that is a little harsh.
If someone want to fuck around on lightning and they don’t have the means or knowledge to run their own LN node, putting a few bucks into bluewallet isn’t a bad thing.
I’ve even made money on LN, transferred it to bluewallet, then changed it to on-chain bitcoin using zigzag.
@_date: 2018-12-25 16:20:27
Only bitcoin is settled upon the closing of a channel so I think your comment is a little misleading.
Yea, any exchange can set up a lightning exchange and convert any crypto into bitcoin, or peer to peer HTLCs can be used, but subsequent hops DO have to be valued in bitcoin (even if the customer sees that same amount in litecoin being deducted from their account).

Holding your funds long term on an exchange is stupid because they can very easily be hacked, become illiquid, or use some sort of fractional reserve system behind the scenes that may ultimately cost you your investment.
If you do think you want to hold a small portion for the potential bitcoin future, get that amount off the exchange and onto a wallet where you alone control your own private keys.
You need to learn more if you want to be immune to any exchange hack, and would rather be in control of your own money. 
Right now coinbases potential fuckups are your problem, not theirs.

The lower the block size is, the better we can hope to propagate it in any future device, thereby increasing the security of the network in a huge way.
Every consideration of an increase in block size comes with a caveat that it will decrease the security of the network over time.
My personal opinion is that security is THE top priority.
Sure you can make it a second priority to an increase of adoption (which is debatable that adoption is limited due to block size), but this will mean nothing if its easier to bring an exponentially lower amount of nodes offline.

I would suggest first moving your crypto to a wallet where you control the private keys. That way, in the event the restore doesn't go as planned, you will still have access to your funds.
The two best options I know of are Samourai wallet for Android and GreenAddress for iOS.
As long as you have those you control your funds. If you don't, someone else controls your funds and bitcoins unofficial catchphrase is 'not your keys, not your coins'.
I'm not sure what wallets you currently use, but I wouldn't trust iCloud with my money.
Think of the 12 or 24 words that are generated with the apps I've mentioned as the master key to your virtual safe deposit box to where your funds are held on the blockchain.
If someone else has those keys and your backup fails, now they are the only ones with those keys.

This is an all too common but shortsighted and myopic view of ‘the reason why people are investing in bitcoin’. 
There are absolutely a ton of people with selling at the top in mind. However, once you do a bit of research you’ll come to find that there are a large number of people who will sell a percentage of their coins, but never sell a certain amount.
These are people that think bitcoin will live to become the best payment system the world has ever seen. Now tell me - if you thought that way, wouldn’t it be idiotic to ever sell that percentage you said you never would, especially after holding on for a number of these boom cycles?
I believe there are more than enough holders in this world for that to become a reality, and I think it’s going to slap a ton of ‘sell at the top ‘ investors in their faces as they keep buying back in at steeper prices.
To get back on point, holding your funds long term on an exchange is stupid because they can very easily be hacked, become illiquid, or use some sort of fractional reserve system behind the scenes that may ultimately cost you your investment.
If you do think you want to hold a small portion for the potential bitcoin future, get that amount off the exchange and onto a wallet where you alone control your own private keys.

My vision is that with the proliferation of 5g wireless networks and improved storage capacity, people will set up a full node + lightning wallet on their mobile phone in a single app download.

Running your own full node ensures that you are part of the group that verifies and validates the blockchain and thus the transactions that occur on the network.
Currently there are only about 10,000 full nodes, which I believe is too few to support a currency with a total value in the tens of billions of fiat value equivalence.
Everyone who uses bitcoin should run a raspberry pi full node imo.

Nodes and ASICS are separate things my man. You can have them separately or together. Plus, the blockchain grows over time, so right now the processing power and bandwidth needed to download and verify the chain pushes the limit of what even the newest phones today are capable of.

Its not based on the dollar. Its a (partially) extrinsic factor. If the dollar were to suddenly drop to 1/100 of its value, the price of bitcoin in terms of dollars would likely be 100 times what it was before that event.
Its value in terms of other currencies would remain unchanged. 
However, since people may lose faith in fiat currencies altogether because of this event, it's likely imo that the price against the dollar would increase even more.
It may be that I'm wrong and that it would have the opposite effect and cause people to move out of crypto and into another fiat currency, but I think this is doubtful.

@_date: 2018-12-23 17:59:58
Your whole rant here is the best reason to embrace bitcoin. If bitcoin were the primary currency of the world, those countries would NOT suffer, governments could not fund senseless wars, and spending on ANYTHING that isn't in the world civilizations best interests (especially in regard to ruling elites interests) would not and could not happen.
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:05:42
No. The most dangerous thing is trusting someone else with your money. Especially money that was built with a primary purpose of NOT requiring ANY trust to function effectively.
@_date: 2018-12-12 03:40:21
Sure the equation is simple when everyone's power cost is 6 cents... You aren't understanding me. What I'm saying is that if more and more people are building mining farms powered from renewables, the overall profit margin at the 6 million dollar/day mark might be larger than the overall profit margin at 11 million per day.
@_date: 2018-12-25 16:23:53
Nah its much less 
@_date: 2019-05-08 02:36:54
First off - you sound new. Are you sure you’re not being scammed? No one has asked you to send them bitcoin, have they?
@_date: 2019-05-08 03:25:35
How long do you intend on holding it - until you net a profit? What if that’s 10 years? You really trust the app to not get hacked or not get shut down due to liquidity problems in that time?
Would you be mad if at the end you were told they were just going to give you the original cash value of the bitcoin, instead of any actual bitcoin due to one of the aforementioned problems?
@_date: 2018-12-24 16:07:08
Just as long as you know how to restore your wallet from seed, you should be fine with whatever you do (even losing your phone and your nano) as long as you have your seed.
@_date: 2018-12-31 00:40:51
Bullshit. People can be on boarded directly into a lightning wallet in the future.
A single 10k bitcoin transaction could give a million people .01 each.
The primary focus of bitcoin needs to be decentralization (read; security) at the cost of EVERYTHING else, so I don't agree that on chain scaling needs to be a priority.
@_date: 2018-12-13 02:46:08
You're not going to make any money off of lightning now or in the future just fyi.
The point of the lightning network is to compete via low fees. If you decide to have more than a 1 Satoshi fee for routing payments, those payments will just be routed around your node.
@_date: 2019-05-26 19:57:28
A good argument if he won’t listen, is that if this guy can make money out of thin air he wouldn’t need an ‘investment’ from anyone else.
Anything too good to be true, always is (as far as money is concerned). Hope he gets it before he sinks any more money into this.
@_date: 2019-05-08 05:39:18
BAHAHAHA. What a tool. I’d love to see how he thinks that would in any way be possible.
He should reorg to get Satoshis coins!!! Lol. What a dumbshit.

Yeah this is a well known scam. You aren’t getting anything from them.
@_date: 2019-05-27 14:54:26
The same is true for me and I’m an American. The only caveat being I DCAed all the way down to 3k.
People forget it was at 3k a hell of a lot longer than it was past 10k even.

Lol I pay maximum $5/yr for my node.

I’m gonna say MCExchange is who is responsible for orchestrating the scam
@_date: 2018-12-24 16:14:09
You shouldn't have to since you're not doing anything to the nano (if all your mobile wallets are the same as your nano ones)

People who are interested in ‘crypto’ haven’t done enough homework to understand why nothing other than bitcoin makes sense.
The rise of altcoins was initially an attempt by the uninformed to get rich like the bitcoin early adopters did.
Bitcoin dominance will ultimately hover around 90% until 2140.
Drunk Edit - just want to add that the base bitcoin blockchain is THE ultimate transfer of value, while the lightning network is THE cheapest, fastest, most decentralized and secure money network the world has EVER seen. It can’t be beat because HASH POWER is king. An entire country worth of hashpower is backing the success of it. Let’s see an alt try to beat that.
@_date: 2018-12-25 00:36:01
Let me know if you need any help bro I'd be down.
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:13:01
GreenAddress for iOS, Samourai for Android. Either is a much better place than coinbase.
Still not as good as a hardware wallet, but MUCH better than coinbase.
With either of these apps you control your private keys, which is the whole point.
@_date: 2019-05-04 02:47:51
What about tying them up in a lightning node over tor and.....doing things with them?

You’re upset because he didn’t explicitly say animals can also value things?
@_date: 2019-05-12 07:36:33
Lol how is no one picking up on my sarcasm? What does a negative bitcoin price even mean?
@_date: 2018-12-31 06:19:30
I'd rather have $8 in bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-12 06:13:01

Easier said than done. What if you mistook the top at 100k when a week later it hits 500k, and the next 85% drop brings it to 75k, but you mistake the bottom again at 120k and fomo back in? 
You just lost 17% of your bitcoin.

Nice! Short, sweet, and right to the point.
@_date: 2018-12-26 06:26:50
Most people understand the difference, it's just that for all intents and purposes, being anonymous when making the purchase is enough. Who cares about creating the channel? People can create a channel to a well known channel, then if no one can see the payments they make, what does it matter?
@_date: 2018-12-26 18:02:50
You've posted this like 8 times now, and yes lightning makes payments anonymous.
Your last sentence is absurdly wrong btw.
What are you pushing here? Lol
@_date: 2018-12-30 08:42:33
There is so much information already out there about this that by you asking this question here, makes me highly doubt you'd be successful.
Do yourself a favor and do your own research on something you could potentially lose a metric fuckton of money on before you ask internet strangers their opinions.
Then, once you've got a solid plan in place, run it by this sub again and maybe you'd get some valuable feedback.
@_date: 2019-05-11 21:47:06

How little bitcoin do they have to hold before they become unprofitable? How many hacks can an exchange endure before people lose trust? I think you assume too much, but it’s obvious we just see things differently.
@_date: 2018-12-15 04:17:02
T.A. Is bullshit
@_date: 2019-05-19 02:38:20
I’d actually rather only have people that have researched and understand bitcoin investing in it. Otherwise, too many people will be using it as a way to gamble, which fucks with everyone’s positions in the short term.

Yeah bullshit statement is bullshit. You have absolutely zero idea as to why the market did what it did when it did.
Stop pretending like you know more than everyone else.
@_date: 2019-05-05 19:56:26
It sounds like your misunderstanding comes from the idea that all cryptocurrency is created equal. That’s false. 
I told you to read the book because it explains why better than I can.

In one of the debates Tim Draper was in, he was arguing why he thinks bitcoin will outpace the dollar, and when asked if he would ever sell his bitcoin when they hit a certain price, he said that quote.
His argument is essentially that bitcoin will always be better than the dollar, especially so in the future, so why would he ever trade it?

Lightning over tor. Good luck.
@_date: 2018-12-30 06:01:12
You can set up a lightning node and use a mobile app like Shango or Union7 or Zap on iOS to send and receive bitcoin over LN on your node either locally or remote if you expose your ports via port forwarding.
@_date: 2019-05-05 19:51:30
I’ve seen this problem more and more lately with on boarding new users. Back when I signed up for coinbase and cash app I could do immediate withdrawals after verification.
Since then it looks like cash doesn’t allow withdrawals for new users, and coinbase has this 2 week waiting period.
It really makes me think these exchanges are having serious liquidity problems.

BlueWallet for iOS and Android. It’s custodial as of now so don’t break the bank on loading it up, but neutrino is coming soon.
Fuck it, I’m feeling good so anyone who downloads it and sets up a LN wallet and pastes an invoice for 100 sats as a reply to this comment I’ll pay it.

Bitcoin is dynamic. Adoption isn’t necessarily due to quick transfers and low fees. If it is, show some proof that undeniably confirms this. I’ll save you the trouble - you can’t because there is none.
Could adoption also be due to security of the network? What happens in 12 months if BTCs hashrate keeps increasing exponentially (like it has been since its inception) and BCHs continues to go down or stay the same (like it has been since its inception)?
I know what answer my money is on.

This thinking is ass backwards.
Exchanges are orders of magnitude less secure than owning your own private keys.
You need to do a bit more research on why bitcoin the protocol is unhackable.

I don't think nodes right now need to be all that liquid considering that were all hoping for an increase in value of BTC compared to $$ within the next 5 years as LN becomes more accessible to the non tech literate.
I would suggest to connect to 5 channels that you know will be around for the long haul, and divide that evenly between them.

Every mined block is found by a single ASIC. So it's always the ratio of the hash rate of that single machine relative to the total bitcoin hash rate.

If bitcoin keeps its trend and goes on to 10mm per, then yeah, living frugally off 10 BTC when they’re 100k each would likely be enough to retire off of.
You would be dumb to sell it all after such a run up.
