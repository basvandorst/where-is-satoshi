What kind of shitty answer is this?? I still got x1000 returns on altcoins, i wouldn’t call that cancer, bet you didnt get anything closer to those returns on btc huh?? Lol what closesminded ppl in the crypto space, all i want is to keep making money off of crypto, idgaf about what crypto specifically lolol, whales manipulate the market anyway, gotta play their game and right now its btc, so gotta play btc game.

What would be the best strategy if my portfolio is like 70-80% altcoints? Like NEO, Eth, Ltc etc. Just HODL or is there a “best time” to switch it to BTC? Maybe when the market bulls again?

Im sorry but if you think Bitcoin has this price because of all the tech stuff, you’re simply delusional. All the bullruns and such are because of whales manipulating markets, 90%+ of people invest in bitcoin because they treat it as an asset, not a currency or all the tech. Regardless, i still won a lot of money with altcoins and btc, but i want to switch my current prtflio to have more btc dominance. I see i will find no real answer in this bitcoin circlejerk sub. Thx for the useless answers anyway :))

Cashed out some, left out some, specially neo ltc and eth, sold my x1000 ripple from 0.20 to 2$, that was beautiful

So there’s probably not an optimal time to sell altcoins into btc? Maybe in the unlikely event BTC loses marketshare vs altcoins? Help a bro out, trying to lose the least amount of money possible

Remember this comment, try to actually push it down your long term memory. Ill obviously forget about your misery when bitcoin booms, yet you’ll probably, hopefully, drown in your negative thoughts of regret. This cute little idiot will laugh to the bank when he cashed most of his satoshis next year�� end of transmission.
