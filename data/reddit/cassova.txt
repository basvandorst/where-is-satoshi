This is just one of the many reasons that the US dollar won't maintain in its place in today's financial markets.

This ~~post~~ *community* is full of jerks.  So what if he exchanged his bitcoins to actual money.  He's marketing your bitcoins.

Especially that fluoride piece. I'm transfixed.

Hi!  With the responses you've been getting you might actually be wondering if Americans use checks for most person-to-person transactions?  I'm an American living in Belgium so I've seen both worlds and might shed some perspective.
To put it simply, yes (partially); most person-to-person transactions still involve checks in some form.  For example, say I live in the US and want to transfer money to a friend to reimburse a trip or pay rent.  The typical method that I'm most familiar with is to use a concept called "Online Bill Pay" which is a generic way of having your bank mail a check to whomever you wish.  It works and operates almost the same as bank transfer in EU where you fill out the form with the recipient information and indicate the amount.  What's the difference?  Well, your friend will be getting a check in the mail instead of having the money in his/her account.  Now (s)he has to wait for the check to come in the mail then go to the bank to put it in their account.  Such a pain!   You can get around this (though I've not experimented with this myself) by putting the mailing address of your friends bank.  Then the only problem for both parties is the waiting for the check to be mailed and processed (and extracting this banking information from your friend).

OK.  Two things:
1. What incentive do people have not to just "hold" bitcoin as the value will increase over time?  Economics shows us that a healthy economy is a spending economy.  It appears that bitcoin encourages us not to spend because it will be worth more tomorrow.
2. When BTC "disappear" it means we don't have the private keys but surely we can someday in the future "hack" this via brute force tactics.  Maybe not today, but someday?

He tipped you.  Shut up and be grateful.
@_date: 2014-04-30 10:11:45
Is this a joke? This is something I'm not familiar.
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:03:25
Sorry for the noob question but this makes me wonder.  I remember hearing that eventually no more bitcoin can be mined.  What sort of economic effect will "losing" currency like this have besides the obvious deflationary aspects?
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:37:51
$30 today $??? tomorrow

Yay, let's support accidental tipping!

Maybe outside this subreddit. They/we hate it here.  Of course we hate everything that isn’t bitcoin. It’s become a religion.
@_date: 2017-06-21 09:57:58
But can you buy 1/3?

I come to this subreddit for news on bitcoin.  If the price is making a swing, I want to know.  Sure, this isn't the most reliable place for my bitcoin news but I enjoy the community and hearing what people are saying now.  I agree with that this ban is unnecessary and undermining the purpose of this community.
