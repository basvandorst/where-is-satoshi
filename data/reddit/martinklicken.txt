You probably don't want to let the secret data to come into contact with the interwebs. Particularly you don't want to send it anywhere. Put it into a veracrypt container yourself on a disconnected machine. Be advised that you are storing a secret in a container protecting it with another secret. Somebody who finds out this secret and has the container can access the secret inside. Also, if your container lock is too strong, you might lose access to the secret inside yourself. 
It may be a good approach to store supersafely encrypted copies of your secret in different places outside your home. At least one less protected copy should be reachable for you or your loved ones in case you panic and forget the access code or something terrible happens to you.

OC that I created with an educational (or enlightening for that matter) purpose in mind with ingredients that are not mine.

That circle is not where we really are. We are not living in a 2-dimensional chart of the past. It is more like a finger pointing to the moon.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:35:45
It probably is from here:

Of course it is an estimate. This is a recent poll in Germany broken down to age of users. The leftmost part has actually acquired bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:01:40
Yes, probably. The formulation of the title and the size of the circle in the graph want to include your estimate.
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:41:48
I agree. It says: less than 5%. I live in Germany. I know a lot of people in research and engineering, but only very few who own bitcoin (most of them heard about it from me), and among those nobody is ready to exchange small amounts of e.g. Litecoin with me or actually use any cryptocurrency practically. I keep record where I can pay with bitcoin. I read the comments in forums and newspapers and listen to the conversations around me. When I visit places like hackerspaces where you can't throw a brick without hitting a nerd still I only get hysterical responses when I offer to pay or accept payment with bitcoin. That is where my estimate of the upper limit of 5% for the current bitcoin adoption rate is coming from.
edit: thanks for the gold, dear stranger! And for clarification: I did not write "being invested" in Bitcoin and the chart is not about people being invested. The chart shows the adoption, how many households had a phone at a given time. Some of you guys seem to confuse having a phone and owning phone company stocks.
edit2: source of the chart:

It is only a "dumb statistic" if you can only think of Bitcoin as something similar to gold or stocks. In case you did not notice, the graph shows things that people did maybe not know they would find useful before they were invented. The s-curve shape is the result of people needing time to understand what the technology can do for them. Also, these curves are shaped by the network effect: not much use for a telephone if I can only call 4 other places in town. When half the town gets one, the use of a phone dramatically increases. If you think of Bitcoin only as an asset and not a technology that changes the way we all live and communicate and organize ourselves, that chart must appear dumb to you.

Also please note, that despite of the steep adoption curves of the radio, air-conditioning or the color tv, there is no crash after mass adoption. These technologies are here to stay. And so is Bitcoin.

I don't understand your logic.

If Draghi accidentally routed only one(!) of these monthly wires into Bitcoin, it would be hitting 8000$+

Thank you! And thanks for the unexpected gold dear stranger - will use it to buy canvas and paint for future drawings.

There is some free space in the bottom right. You could make a piece of paper with the current bitcoin/usd exchange rate and put it on display.
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:23:27
Nobody knows for sure. Could be anywhere between 3.48% and 3.55%
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:41:09
that's more like the reaction of somebody who sees it correcting for the second time in his life.

She looks really cute! But I'd rather stick with my bitcoins, thank you!
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:32:09
Moar bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-04 16:35:40
Secure - yes. Safe - depends on the user.
@_date: 2018-06-02 19:57:28
That's great! I hereby declare it the official improvement :)
@_date: 2018-06-02 19:38:09
Yes, I created it, thanks for pointing it out! Let me use this space here to clarify: the person is not holding the stick, neither is Bitcoin reaching for his crotch.
Bitcoin knows that most people out there are rather enthusiastic about it, but have really no plan whatsoever how to get involved with it.
That is why Bitcoin is reaching for the person's hand. Let it show you how to get involved, by educating yourself. For example, start with some Antonopoulos videos. Then go on.
@_date: 2018-06-02 19:43:48
Nice :) But you can't prevent people from seing goofy stuff. With that version the "reaching for his crotch" faction will thrive.
@_date: 2018-06-04 05:55:46
Nice! Your watch face is bridging ancient systems and modern technologies. What is 61°F in degrees Rømer (°Rø)?

It's not possible because a wallet has to keep that private key with itself, which this particular wallet can't, since it is an HD wallet that deterministically generates all keys from the mnemonic seed. In other words: the 12 words you note down as your wallet backup and keep in a safe place will never learn about that additional private key you imported from somewhere. Thus, it can not become part of the wallet. You need to sweep.
@_date: 2017-09-10 18:52:16
There is no need to clone the device. You note down your 24 word mnemonic seed and keep that as a backup. From these words, the complete wallet can be recreated in case of loss of your device. Either on a new hardware wallet or in software.

Then I recommend you find out what tax if any you are expected to pay in your country anyway. If you live in Germany for example, no tax if you keep your coins for a year. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 16:36:26
Did you somewhere in your question state under which jurisdiction you are? If your question was more about the technical possibility of outsmarting the IRS - it is safer to pay your taxes.

Found this while testing GreenAddress today, messing around a bit with segwit transactions. I hope that's only the user interface and no such mix-ups of concepts can be found in the code. We are still in a very early adoption stage, I guess. It is exciting to be a witness of these times!

I stopped watching when it said "because gold has high intrinsic value..."
