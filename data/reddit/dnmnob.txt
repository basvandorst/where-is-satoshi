This isn't completely true. The Finance Ministry has proposed to the Tax Directorate that they change their interpretation of VAT on Bitoin to follow rules set in EU. But formally, the Tax Directorate has not done so, though they probably will.

Thanks for the cheap coins, sellers. And thanks for giving the true definition of holders away to stronger hands.

Say it has been trading for ~1000 the whole week and there is a drop to 900. Wouldnt the buy order trigger at lets say 980 and you will instantly be left with a 80$ loss pr btc?

Don't know about that guaranteed 100% uptime if they're going to be running BU.

Thanks, but does this answer why the difference between Poloniex and Kraken is so high? It would explain why Bitfinex had high price, but Kraken and Poloniex is not affected with withdrawals as far as I know?
  
And also, there's nothing that stops me from selling high on Poloniex and buying low on Kraken? I don't mind the risk of not being able to withdraw USD, as I'd just transfer the bitcoins to another place as you said.

Thanks for clearing this up! I didn't know that :) So it's not possible to withdraw USD from Poloniex either?
