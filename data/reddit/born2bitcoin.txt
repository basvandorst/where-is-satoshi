Definitely agree. I’m just trying to get as many sats as possible before the price skyrockets.

I did it ~a month ago and it worked just fine, I was helping my gf set up her account last week and I had the same issue. I just sent the funds to my CBP account and then to hers.

If you’re only going to be sending money in USD, DAI is a stablecoin developed specifically for that purpose.

The graph is bitcoin’s price. 
The top, green, descending line is BTC’s trend line for it’s Lower Highs. 
The bottom, red, ascending lines connect from the start of BTC’s price increases in the beginning of april and go through the last 2 lowest prices, basically giving us a “range” where the price might drop to (I didn’t bother doing this with the higher price as they were close enough to where I didn’t consider it to be significant lol). If it breaks through €9 200/$10 200 I think it will drop to €9 000/$10 000 and then go back up to €10 100-10 000/$11 400-11 300 in the next 3-7 days. 
The arrows are drawn perpedicular (ish) to previous decreases/increases.
*disclaimer* I’m a total noob at this. Don’t take my advice seriously. I just wanted to brag and be a douchebag tbh. I got lucky a few times but that luck might run out soon.

It was something like €8998 but don’t look into it too much, I drew these arrows at 7 am without sleep on my phone lmao

I’ve been using versions of this since mid july but okay ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

It “saved my ass” as it allowed me to roughly double my sats in a few weeks’ time. If you don’t have deep pockets, it does matter whether the price is 10,900 or 9,100 imo

R34s have skyrocketed over the last couple of years. Keep it clean &amp; you can sell it for profit in the future.

Most, if not all exchanges allow for small amounts to be bought. I think the minimum on coinbase is $10. Use Coinbase Pro though. They’re the same company but Pro’s fees are much lower (0.15% compared to $2.99 for transactions under $200 and 1.49% above $200 on regular coinbase)
