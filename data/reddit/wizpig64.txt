The game definitely borrows heavily from that kind of imagery

[3 BTC as of the most recent trade]( not a huge amount compared to others, but still a huge amount as someone about to buy their first car (they're still worth $1000 in my mind). Luckily its only about half of my coin, and with how early i got in i may still be "profitable" (again if they go to $1k again). They're currently on sale at coinbase... but ugh i feel a bit sick now to do that.
edit: hope i get my nickel back.

And bitcoin isn't a line of credit either...

That's if you bought in before the big boom.

I did exactly the same thing as you, but cashed out when it got low :(

Seems to me like the two parties are trying to do the same thing, the 'panic' group just has poor timing.

Looks like you just need to be verified to deposit/withdraw with dwolla or a bank transfer. You could do bitinstant -&gt; bitcoin wallet, and then wallet -&gt; mtgox, I believe. If you can't get it into mtgox instantly, at least you have the coins in your own wallet.

OP is right to assume it's the law to pay taxes and that people don't want to be thrown in prison.

I did the same thing back in 2011, turned about $250 of cash into $85. The worst bit is that if I had left that last $85 in bitcoin instead of withdrawing it, that would have been worth quite a bit more today. So basically this time I put another couple hundred in and I'm putting it in cold storage where even I can't touch it.

not at all trying to call you out in particular, just amateurs like myself. The quote was supposed to be more greentext-y.

the fastest way to turn dollars into bitcoin right now is to use something like bitinstant, but its kinda sorta sketchy, involving going to a local moneygram place and sending cash to an intermediary called ZipZap. It worked for me (~$200), but there are plenty of people for whom the process didn't work but are stuck waiting days for tech support (see: google). If you know someone in real life with bitcoin to sell, you could do it that way. The other way to do it is to open a dwolla (paypal alternative) account, do a bank transfer from your bank to them, and then send money from dwolla to mtgox.com. Currently though you have to send mtgox your personal information to verify your identity in order to deposit/withdraw USD, and this process can take weeks to go through. Mtgox is the least sketchy way of doing it, but also the slowest.

You'd think it would taste like chocolate and unicorns but gold just tastes like metal or dirt. Would not really go well on a desert.
