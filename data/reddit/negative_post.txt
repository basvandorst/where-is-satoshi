Why would he be arrested? It violates terms of use and might get a ban for his google account but this does not warrant an arrest.

He took bitcoins not money, and I am being serious here. They can be converted to money if the thief wants but the actual theft was of bitcoins. 
Yes it pisses everyone off that someone did this but we have to be logical in thinking on how we can punish them. If we are to arrest and charge them then on what grounds, we don't even know if they are located in the USA and this could have been a Russian hacker.

I'm surprised you are not worried that bitcoin is limited to 7 transactions a second. If this was to go global it would not meet demand. :(

Go to a credit union. No fees for me!

But can bitcoin handle 51 million transactions per day? That's just people using Mastercard mind you, I'm not including people using Visa, Amex, or Discover.

Way too many truths... :(

Dear lord, I'm going to move over to another coin then! The future is not with bitcoin if it cannot work in a world economy.

He must have sold bitcoins through Localbitcoins. Guys buying from me always carry a knife, which is why I bring the guns.

Now imagine the blockchain running 51 million transactions a day like Mastercard. It can not handle that traffic.
