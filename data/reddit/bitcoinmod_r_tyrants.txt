I'll ask your mother to introduce me to more people her age next time I see her. Thanks for the suggestion.

No. We want to discuss that here, in The mods are being tyrants by trying to suppress discussion that we the people want to have, *here*.

It does because we were having a discussion about how bitcoin has failed and is continuing to fail by not doing anything positive for the community. The point was that dogecoin does this better and that bitcoin can learn a thing or two about making a true fun and usable crypto like dogecoin.

Bitcoin isn't serious at all, in fact its a joke and in every other subreddit we laugh at you for your idiotic greed and desire to become wealthy off of speculation. Dogecoin is actually building a real economy and it's prospering much faster than bitcoin. In fact recently there has been a net decrease in the number of bitcoin users as many gave up after getting goxxed, and many more got out because of the price tanking.

No, that is wrong. It has *everything* to do with bitcoin because it is currently overcoming bitcoin as a true cryptocurrency. The main reason for this is that people actually use dogecoin for transactions and not just hodling. It is actually being used to create economic growth. All bitcoin has ever been used for is to be a tool of greedy speculators that want to get rich without doing any actual work.
Dogecoin is good for the community, and we see clearly here that it is taking the spotlight from bitcoin. That is something that we have all collectively decided is important enough to talk about. If you don't like it then take your minority opinion and go discuss it elsewhere.

Right on, this is exactly correct. 0.001% of bitcoin users are actually generous, the rest of them are just get-rich-quick scheming speculators that would rather day trade all day and make money off of hype and the idiocy of other people doing the same thing. Dogecoin is all about generosity and giving, and it is the only crypto that truly brings smiles to peoples faces when they use it.

It's just passion we have for the future of money. We know that the world will be using dogecoin for major purchases and we can see that because of how much publicity and goodwill dogecoin is gaining in the media. Everyone I know knows about dogecoin, very few people know about bitcoin, and that's because its not actually being used for economic transactions. People are just using bitcoin to speculate, there is no sharing of the wealth going on with that.

But you see, you're completely wrong about that. Dogecoin is currently surpassing bitcoin in mindshare and that is an important thing to discuss in the bitcoin subreddit. It's a pretty important topic, since bitcoin adoption is dwindling so long as bitcoiners continue to be a community that isn't based on generosity and actual usage of the currency (as opposed to the hodl mentality here).

No, you absolutely don't know what you're talking about. You're a brainwashed idiot.


This is a failed point since bitcoin has already failed (as can be seen by the fact that dogecoin is much more popular than it and it has only existed a few months) and dogecoin has already succeeded. Dogecoin is a true crypto in the sense that it enables and fosters economic growth, not speculation and greed.
Also dogecoin transactions get confirmed way WAY quicker than bitcoin, how the hell are you going to use bitcoin for anything serious when you have to wait hours for confirmations to come in. It's already got a bloated blockchain with no way to fix it, so its doomed.

I think you're brainwashed to think that bitcoin has actually ever done anything good for anyone. If anything it has contributed negative wealth to the world as a whole. Do you see how many thieves and criminals use bitcoin, all the damage and destruction they've caused? The hundreds of millions that have been laundered or stolen via mt gox and the silk road? Bitcoin for the most part has been a source of destruction and bad things. You never hear of this happening with dogecoin, and that is precisely what makes dogecoin superior; it ultimately is what will allow dogecoin to be the supreme crypto that rules all others.

Smoke a bowl every time the price goes below or above that level.
