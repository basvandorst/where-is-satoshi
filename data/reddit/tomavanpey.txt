Bitcoin, shbitcoin! There are other affordable top cryptos that you can own in full!

Bitcoing will someday be the planet's sole currency like in science-fiction. 
@_date: 2019-08-13 21:04:00
It seriously is.
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:22:19
Cool, thx.
It doesn't matter if my public address is shown to the world, right?
@_date: 2017-10-17 23:18:13
In the same vein, was mining easy, cost-effective and user-friendly?

Hmmm... Not untrue.

Dude... Teach me. (^_^)
Well today, I took action and opened my Coinbase account and put 12$  in bitcoin, ethereum and litecoin.
I hope to be a millionaire in probably... never.

Are you or can you now live the good life from your early-ish btc investment?
@_date: 2017-05-29 12:24:23
Oi, please don't remind me of that missed boat... It burns!
@_date: 2017-05-31 06:03:26
Will do!
@_date: 2017-05-31 05:23:34
Uh, is it okay to buy more if disposable money comes along?
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:43:02
Imagine 10 000 Ƀ bought then...
The pain... It buuuurns...
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:56:22
Where would somebody hodl such a haul even if that guy was legit anyway? 
@_date: 2018-12-14 23:29:42
I'll be only impressed if it was a Tesla S.
(it rhymes!)
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:25:58
But returning to my original question, for example, how did the 27$ Scandinavian guy manage to buy bitcoin in 2009?
@_date: 2017-06-06 23:01:58
Ugh! Not exactly hassle-free indeed.
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:13:15
I vaguely heard about that software.
Why doesn't every person mine from their own computer now?

With all the bitcoin trading sites like Coinbase, does paper walletting still hold (har har)?
