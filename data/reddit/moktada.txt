Some analysis here, not sure wot to conclude though other than the transaction malleability attack can be seen in the blockchain so it definitely happened...

Could the blockchain.info tagging system be used to avoid connecting reddit accounts with wallets?  So ppl could just all tag addresses with the same string, and not even have to comment here.  Not sure if the tagging can be done at transaction level, or if it is just wallet level?
Would have added bonus of being able to do some of this more automatically and with fewer comments here

Scanning the blockchain from the block he proved he owned, but back in time, shows he seemed to like splitting his wallets up into 50k chunks, and then occasionally amalgamating them.  Presumably he had a program that did this for him.
After his proof of ownership, there are several 50k wallets that are very close to the wallet he proved he owned, and were created back on 16 Nov 2011, and lie untouched since then.  This is a good example; 
So either; he was hacked in Nov 2011, or he still owns the wallets
Given his apparent signature move of 50k chunks, both before and after his proof of ownership, strongly indicates that he is still the owner.

2000 is how much the leaked doc says is all that is left in Gox...
And Gox started around 2010...

This address was used by Mark Karpeles to prove he had bitcoins last time, moving half the apparent thefts worth (424,242!)
(discussion of this can be seen at 
Following where all they went would probably be useful...  Does he still have it as a personal stash?
