No shit I downvote. You're trolling if you don't understand that a currency nobody uses will be worthless.

But this is assuming fiat disappears. If btc really reaches that level of adoption, it'll just reach price parity. For example, if a Bitcoin really was 1 million USD, I could just buy 1 dollar worth of Bitcoin and use that to pay for a candy bar in a vending machine. It wouldn't make sense for a snickers to be 1 USD but also 1 btc, it'll have to reach a parity. So why would btc stay at such a high price when people can just exchange how much they have in fiat into btc? Isn't this what we're heading towards or am I crazy?

Dude is trolling. He's legit asking me to proof that a currency nobody use is worthless. What a joke

Amazing why other people can understand this simple concept but you can't. Bitcoin is not a store of value like you think it is. Bitcoin is s a currency. If nobody uses Bitcoin as a currency, it will be worthless. You seem to think that the price will just go up everyday despite having next to no real world uses. Do I have to spell it out for you why that won't work?

I'm not telling you to spend your Bitcoin, you would understand that if you actually read what I wrote.

A vast majority of btc's dollar valuation comes from it being able to function as a currency. It was created to function as currency. This "store of value" narrative (which btw, btc is not a good store of value) is only gaining traction because people are realizing there are better coin options. Yes, if you only see btc as an investment vehicle to increase your fiat accounts, then none of this matters. But if you care about the future of bitcoin, this mindless "I'm only in it for the fiat value" is unhealthy.
