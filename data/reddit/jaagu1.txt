Estonia on the first place? You must be kidding. Another piece of bad journalism. Read [here]( and [here]( about the real situation about this police state "where a cryptocurrency users can certainly feel welcome".
Besides, if you read court arguments then you could see that Estonia was one of the two EU countries arguing [against of VAT exemption]( and the only EU country which interpreted EU law in such a perverted way, that VAT should be collected both on service (of converting BTC to fiat) and goods (bitcoin itself)! Other few countries in EU (Sweden, Germany) wanted to charge VAT only on service.
