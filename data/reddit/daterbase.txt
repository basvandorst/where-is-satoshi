Is your hypothesis that after the halving diminished supply, the relatively unchanged demand drove up to the $250 spike 5 months later? Seems like a really long timeframe, especially when you include the $1100 spike a full year after the halving.

Hopefully it allows everyone to have more control over their own property, not just the most powerful and not in a way that gives them control over other people's property. For example, there is no way for someone else to authorize a bitcoin transaction from your wallet. Instead of getting automatically charged for your items as you walk out the door, maybe you'd have to pay for the items yourself before the door unlocks.

Every time I spend/send some BTC I'm amazed at how fast and easy it is. For example, I can be out to dinner and send money to a friend across the country from my phone in the time it takes to send a text. Online and in-store purchases have been just as easy scanning QR codes.

Yeah, as much as I love both Uber and BTC I can't think of why I'd benefit from using BTC with Uber specifically. You'd either have to load your account with BTC or opt to pay Uber directly after the ride with a mobile wallet. Both of those options are more work for both the user and Uber. 
It would be cool if they setup a multisig wallet for each user, where Uber has one key, user the other and some arbitrator the last. After your ride, an alert would come up on your phone from the app asking you to sign off on BTC payment. If you don't pay within 24 hours it charges your CC. I guess there are a lot of interesting ways this could be done but they are all a lot of work to implement into a system that is seemingly so elegant already.

If you've ever transacted in Bitcoin before then the people on the other ends of those transactions know those addresses you own. Stack those with your cold storage and other wallets and you give those people a good idea of what your total holdings could be, and maybe who you transact with (past and future) if those addresses happen to be known.

I would hope ~~not~~ [you wouldn't have to hold a balance] because preloading a BTC balance is not how I'd want to use bitcoin. My idea has been that they would still require a CC on file. After a ride, they'd send your receipt with a "pay with bitcoin" option. If you don't send BTC within the next 24 hours or so they would just charge your CC. 
They still need to make sure you pay for the ride. There could be other ways to encourage you to pay, like not allowing you to order another driver until you pay, which is what happens if your CC is declined for the previous ride.

WARNING: SPECULATION AHEAD!
Don't forget to consider that everyday uses of currency like buying food, gas, paying bills, etc. are not possible with BTC at the moment. Even buying computer hardware online with BTC requires some work arounds. If major online merchants start accepting BTC, demand will be much higher. If everyday brick and mortar shops accept BTC, demand will be higher still. 
I admit there is a discrepancy between the rate of inflation and the level of demand, but I'm guessing that will go both ways at different points in time.

Nope. Make a backup of your wallet and store it somewhere safe. If you create new addresses later, you will have to back those up too.

I think it will still take some time for the price to start moving up based on the lower supply, so don't be disappointed if it's not well on the way to the moon by your bday. 
Speculators have already built in some price increase by now but whoever is steadily buying btc will have less supply to deal with, which I'm guessing will start a gradual build that then can trigger more speculation and hype.

Moving them to your own wallet means that you would then own the BTC. Until then, the Bitstamp DB says that they owe you that BTC. If Bitstamp does not ever intend to allow users to withdraw both BTC and BCC, then you will never be able to access the BCC after the fork. If you move them to the control of your own private keys (your own wallet), then you will be able to use those private keys to access your BCC when the time comes.
Green Address looks like it has some cool functionality, but I'd personally stay away from them because I wouldn't want my BTC tied up with their private key in a 2of2 or 2of3 multisig scheme, but maybe someone else can provide more info on that. Some wallets with good reputations are breadwallet, electrum, and mycelium, and I'm sure you'll get a few other recommendations here. Definitely get a hardware wallet like trezor or ledger for your long term storage needs.

One thing I think is a critical flaw: it doesn't seem to update the panic threshold, so if the price has risen since you loaded the page and then it goes up and down a bunch but never drops back below your starting point, it says PANIC BUY the whole time. It's gotta be way more panic finicky. You could update the panic threshold based on % or absolute price change but that would be a pain in the butt, just update it to the current price every minute or something.

Maybe they don't go on strike because they are disorganized (not unionized) but I think it's more likely that they don't strike because they do fine on tips. The best servers probably think they would make less money if they didn't get their usual 20% tips. Cost of food at restaurants would certainly go up to compensate for the extra cost so it's not like a server would magically get fair compensation and the restaurant goer would get the same or better deal as before.

I guess if you have a bitcoin wallet on your phone or accessible computer at the time then a thief could threaten you to transfer the funds to him. But those funds would be forever tainted if you let the community know.
