Kids and average joes arent market makers, the fact that CME hasn't any effect skyrocketing the price makes investors getting out in better assets, the support of past weeks was because the institutional money wanted to speculate, now is game over. The real price is at 5k -8k

Btc grew up 20x in a year 2x in 3 weeks, those gains in short time are not sustainable, the real price with organic growth at this time is around 5k to 8k. 20k was to soon. Dont worry btc to 50k in a few months.

Just wait and see, a lot of bitcoiners think fk gov fk banks buy they are just hodling in hopes of exchange their btc for fiat in the future, if govs and banks make crypto illegal expect your investment stucked in the limbo, party will be over.

The party is nearly over, a lot of manipulation drives the price to ath every week, just wait and see the big short of big banks cooming.
I see a lot of newbies trying to buy .0001 bitcoin right now at all time high and pre-hardfork, waiting the price to go 1 000 000 to become millionaires, that is insane!

Bitcoin isnt a gov backed shitcoin?
Until bitcoin pairs with USD bitcoin will be shitcoin backed money all investors, hodlers and all the new dumb money flowing into bitcoin expect exchange their crypto for fiat.
Where is the cyber anarchy of the good old times nowdays...?
