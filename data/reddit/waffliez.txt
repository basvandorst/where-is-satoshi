Haha thanks for the advice.
I would probably mainly use it for tracking fitness, So I'm glad It holds up. I might need to get one at the end of the month.
Also I wish I could use an Iphone, but too many features are missing that I adore on android and could never get over it.

I am somewhat new to bitcoin and I dont really know what if what I am using is considered a hardware wallet. I use "bitcoin core" which is installend on my large HD with all of the DB of blocks I guess. Am I safe with that wallet? Is there any wallet you would recommend?

Yeah mostly trading. You can mine other alt coins if you want though.
I make about  .03 BTC (~80 usd) a week with 2 gtx 1080's from mining alt coins.

I mine whatever is most profitable. Ethereum is one of them. Most of the time I mine lbry and sell it instantly. It also depends if you have an amd gpu or nvidia gpu
