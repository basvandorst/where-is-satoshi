I don't see how that's possible since the video starts out by agreeing with the NAP. Your comments clearly indicate that you don't agree with it. (Namely, it makes a moral distinction between different kinds of force and you have repeatedly remarked that you don't care about that. You only care if there is *some* force being done unto you.)
Note that the video says, "If we stop here, then that is what I would call voluntaryism." Technically, I am a voluntaryist first. I just see the essential differences between voluntaryism and anarcho-capitalism as completely moot to our discussion, since you don't even accept any of the fundamental assumptions of these philosophies. Therefore, it's completely non-sensical for **you** to reason about the implications of those assumptions.
The initial description that the video author gives of anarcho-capitalism is wildly inaccurate. He claims that an anarcho-capitalist society has no accountability, no rules and no regulations. But that's just not true. Those things are simply privatized. Thus, the author demonstrates a fairly fundamental misunderstanding of anarcho-capitalism. (To be fair, the author goes on to describe privatized institutions that solve these problems, which makes his initial description highly suspect and clearly biased.)
He goes on to say that the free market, if allowed to operate, would **prevent abuses**. Does he mean all abuses? I certainly wouldn't claim that. Also, there is not a lot of literature on free market solutions to *prevent* violence. Namely, it's definitely not a core claim of anarcho-capitalists. Therefore, I am rather baffled that criticizing ideas for the prevention of violence in a free market takes such a center stage in the video. Most free market literature around violence is about **restitution** not **prevention**.
The worst part of all of this is that his criticism is rooted in an *argumentum ad ignoriantum*. Just because someone can't envision precisely how a particular problem is solved by a freed market does not mean an adequate solution does not exist.
He then goes on to state that free markets are amoral (true) and that therefore business will participate in dumping waste and slave labor. This yet again represents a significant misunderstanding of private property. Namely, dumping waste would only be permissible if you dumped it on property you own or on property that you had permission to use for that purpose. Dumping waste is only a problem today because of the commons. And of course, slave labor is a violation of the NAP which could be prosecuted in a free society.
Then he makes that claim that anarcho-capitalists think that markets incentivize morality. Uh, no. Not at all. So that's a straw man. Markets are nothing more than individuals acting voluntarily. So of individuals want to be moral, then markets made up of those individuals will align with those morals. There is no fixing the fact that different individuals have different morals, and as a result, the organizations that cater to those individuals (governments or firms) tend to correspond roughly to those morals.
Citing the BP oil spill is fucking ridiculous. The spill occurred **on public property**! If it occurred on private property, then BP would be liable for all the damage they caused. But since it was on public property... who knows what they were liable for since there is no market place in the ocean!
Honestly, most of the latter half of that video is just plain FUD. All he's doing it pointing out that people can be evil. Yeah. So?
Ah and here is the crescendo! He claims that firms and governments are identical in terms of social structure. Welp. Governments have a monopoly on the use of legitimatized coercion in a given geographic region and its people and property. Firms do not. That's a **very** different social structure. At this point, I can't help but feel duped by the beginning of the video when he seemed to get some of the basic facts correct.
So his final argument boils down to a huge fucking straw man by way of a false equivalence. I'm not impressed.

That's exactly what governments do---go around and steal your property. Anarcho-capitalism isn't about solving all of the world's ills. There may very well still be people going around trying to steal others' property.
The idea is that people will want to defend themselves. Since defending yourself from significant threats either through actual self defense or through courts can be costly, it stands to reason that there will be demand for firms that specialize in such things. Thus, I could hire a firm to protect me, similar to how insurance agencies work today.
If there's a group of thugs in the area going around to houses stealing things, I imagine that my insurance policy would provide a number I could call when I need emergency self defense support.
Keep in mind, EwoutDVP, I was merely correcting your **severe** misunderstanding of anarcho-capitalism. You asked a follow up question that *has no one answer*. I can only make an educated guess on how things will happen based on my ability to take the perspective of others. This isn't a shortcoming of anarcho-capitalism; it's a *feature*.
@_date: 2013-07-26 16:23:23


Anarcho-capitalists are not for the decentralization of power *per se*. They are against the *illegitimate* use of force. It just so happens that this implies that the biggest centralization of power in our society should be abolished (the government). But the legitimacy of the use of force has nothing to do with the centralization of power.
@_date: 2013-07-26 16:11:14
Anarcho-capitalism is not about the absence of coercion. It's about the privatization of conflict resolution.
The absence of coercion is a Utopian ideal, and anarcho-capitalism is not Utopian.
@_date: 2013-07-26 21:08:06


I said:


And in response you said:


Since no socio-economic organization (that I know of) has the goal of solving every ill, then you must reject them. Otherwise, you're applying your litmus test inconsistently. Thus, there are two alternatives: 1) you're being inconsistent or 2) you reject all other socio-economic organizations.
I gave you the benefit of the doubt and assumed you were capable of applying basic logic consistently. Therefore, I concluded that you reject all other socio-economic organizations.


OK. Then you're being disingenuous. All known socio-economic organizations seek to do *something* with conflict, because it is assumed to exist. Therefore, you're lodging criticisms against these ideas unfairly because you **do not acknowledge that you reject their core assumptions**.
If you want to engage in ***GENUINE*** conversation, then you'd do well to start out by saying, "I reject the notion that coercion cannot be removed completely and therefore believe in a Utopian ideal. Therefore, I reject your advocation of {PHILOSOPHY X} because it assumes coercion cannot be eradicated completely."
So are you paying lip service to "asking genuine questions", or do you actually seek to present credibility in your comments?


In other words, either everyone should be allowed to do as they please *without restriction*, or we must all be pacifists. Anarcho-capitalism *assumes some* distinction among different kinds of coercion. If you reject that distinction can *even exist*, then you reject everything that follows from that distinction. There is no "convincing" to be done. Similarly, every socio-economic organization I can think of makes *some* distinction between different kinds of coercion, so you'd have to reject all of those as well.
Thus, your criticisms are not specific to anarcho-capitalism, and by portraying them as such, you're being intellectually dishonest.
@_date: 2013-07-28 15:17:10


OK. Well I'm not going to buy a book to fact check you. So if you have any online resources that can corroborate the contents of that book, that'd be great.


I explained to you why it matters. And it doesn't matter whether you personally subscribe to either of them.


Yes. This is precisely the claim I have been attacking this entire time. The whole point is that coercion cannot be abolished. The primary difference between anarcho-capitalism and common statist philosophies is to put legitimate and illegitimate coercion on the same footing. This empowers individuals to take self defense into their own hands in all cases, and not fear reprisal from the legal system itself.
Any philosophy that seeks to abolish coercion must also reject any notion of **resolving conflict between humans**. The presence of conflict implies the existence of coercion. Conflict is a necessary fact of our current reality because of scarcity of resources and some level of egoism. Hence, my earlier response that abolishing coercion completely is Utopian.


The whole point of bringing other ideologies into this is to demonstrate your criticism pointed at anarcho-capitalism as useless. That is, if your criticism applies to **every** socio-economic organization, then your criticism can be dismissed as a criticism against socio-economic organizations. More probably, it is a criticism against human nature itself. Hence the reason I've been asking for a source that provides a socio-economic organization with a viable means of **eliminating coercion**. If you cannot provide one, then it's a reasonable standard of evidence to conclude that your criticism is actually pointed at something else. Thus, it is not a problem of anarcho-capitalism *per se*, but rather, a problem you have with human nature.
I have similar problems with human nature, but I don't lodge those criticisms out of context.


See above. Your litmus test directly implicates the relevancy of your criticism.


You would have whatever legal recourse that is in your power to enact. The only difference between the criminal private jail you speak of and government's jails is that the former is *illegitimate with respect to the law of the land*. If it is unlawful, then its power is inherently limited compared to jails that are operating lawfully using legitimized coercion.


No. I'm trying to club you over the head with your own misunderstandings about anarcho-capitalism. You're criticizing anarcho-capitalism for precisely the thing that Statist philosophies do.
You neglected to respond to this:


@_date: 2013-07-26 19:42:10


Hence the reason I said, "***IF*** you believe ...". More to the point, you directly implied that you'll refuse any socio-economic organization in which coercion still happens. **This is Utopian**. Are you going to respond to this criticism, or just go on blissfully ignoring it?


Coercion will always exist. That is the point. If you don't believe that, then there's no point in discussing anything.
Anarcho-capitalism is about privatizing conflict resolution. Namely, it's the removal of the **illegitimate** use of force. Stated differently, it's the removal of the initiation of force sanctioned by the law of the land.
Conflict still occurs. Individuals can still seek to initiate force against others, **just like they can now**. And just like they'll be able to do in any socio-economic organization. Importantly, anarcho-capitalism empowers individuals to use force in defense of the aggression of others. This can happen because the monopoly on the use of legitimized coercion no longer exists.
@_date: 2013-07-28 23:20:41


Not specifically, no. I like to simplify. Using labels instead of complete sentences is simpler and makes conversation easier (in most cases).


I'm a pragmatist too. That doesn't stop me from advocating against legitimized coercion.


We are not discussing science. (I am a scientist in training.)


You linked to that video to support your claim that you are agnostic. I then explained to you how you misused the word.


They can force you to follow the law. All coercion is bad. Not all force is bad. The words "coercion" and "force" cannot be used interchangeably.
Being morally opposed to all force is equivalent to pacifism.
Allow me to remind you what it would take to for a socio-economic organization to be "coercion free." It would mean zero murder. Zero rape. Zero bar fights. Zero child abuse. Zero car accidents or accidental poisoning caused by another individual (intentional or not). Etc... The reason why you should state this up front is because it puts your criticisms into the context of, "It's not I am unconvinced by your philosophy, I am unconvinced that the total abolition of coercion is impossible. I will only advocate for a socio-economic organization that ends all coercion." Thus, people can then focus the argument where it should be: on explaining to you why coercion cannot be eradicated **instead of** wasting time defending a specific philosophy. **The way you represent yourself now is disingenuous.**
Why can't you address any of my criticisms? You consistently ignore large parts of my comments. Are you trolling?
@_date: 2013-07-29 15:19:35


Then you should explain **why** it's irrelevant. Obviously, **I think** it's relevant. If you think it's irrelevant, then there is a misunderstanding somewhere. If you want a **genuine** conversation, why wouldn't you want to correct any possible misunderstandings?


Labels are a means to simplify discussion. Semantics are the life blood of philosophy.
***No part of this conversation has ever focused anything on your own ideals***. That you think that is **strong evidence** to support that you're trolling. I've explicitly explained how your own ideals are irrelevant.


That may be what you **want**, but that **isn't what you're doing**. I've explained it to you several times. Get it through your thick skull.


You'll get a different response from different people, but Anarchists (in the traditional sense) do not believe in private property. They believe private property is a form of coercion.


That is certainly possible. Kind of like what governments do today. The upshot with anarcho-capitalism is that war is an inherently very costly exercise, and without forceful taxation and the support of a large population, it's going to be hard for any one organization to persist in war.


The authority is found in the individual. If you steal from me, then I have the ability to pursue restitution. Probably through my defense insurance or something like that.
Ownership is just a description of an exclusive relationship between you and a piece of property. Each individual is responsible for defending their ownership over their property.


I don't see why an anarcho-capitalist society couldn't have judges, police and jails.


The exact same reasons why you wouldn't steal that car today. You'd get in trouble for doing it. As long a person can establish that car as *being owned by them* (how? doesn't matter. the market will work out something), then they can pursue the person who took it and rightly seek restitution (perhaps the car itself and the costs required for tracking down the thief). I'd imagine I could hire a firm to do that restitution seeking for me.
Remember what I said earlier? Anarcho-capitalism is the privatization of conflict resolution. That's it.
@_date: 2013-08-02 20:27:49


If you steal from someone, you're subject to being forced to provide restitution if the victim seeks you out. I'd call that a kind of regulation.


You're asking us to predict the future of all human behavior. All we can do is hypothesize. If I don't know something, I'm not afraid to admit it, and I'm not going to bend over, be dishonest and make some bullshit up because you "don't buy it."


Only the victim of aggression has standing to defend himself against that aggression. If society at large is practicing slavery, then it will indeed be difficult to stop without some sort of social evolution that prescribes the practice as evil. Kind of like how it has worked throughout human history.
What you're asking is no different than asking, "What if governments don't outlaw slavery? Who will prosecute you then?" Which is, *ahem*, exactly what happened.


God you're thick. The property owners.


If there was no other damage caused to someone else's property, then there would have been no aggression on BP's part.


How did we acquire land?


You must have a time machine. Can I use it?


Of course violence and coercion won't disappear. Have you really learned **fucking nothing** from this?


The vast majority of all human murders occur at the hands of governments through wars, imperialism and economic oppression backed up by the threat of force. If you're going to point out a few third world countries where some groups of people are being evil and think that's even a drop in the bucket compared to the absolute fucking evil persisted by governments throughout history, then you're just plain fucking delusional.
You'll have to excuse my colorful fucking language. But conversation with you is about as thick as it gets.
@_date: 2013-07-28 17:55:24


Law does not require coercion. Law only requires *force*. Coercion is the initiation of force. Self defense is the use of force in response to initiatory force. Legitimized coercion is equivalent to laws imposed with the initiation of force.


OK. Conversation over. You're a Utopian. You should at least state this up front before wasting everyone's time. Or, at least, if you don't like the moniker of Utopian, then provide that quoted sentence as a disclaimer. It will put your criticisms into appropriate context and prevent comment threads as deep as this one before you've finally come out and stated clearly what it is you're trying to say. More to the point, it will **make you genuine**.
@_date: 2013-07-27 19:21:04


**No they don't**. Go read any anarchism literature, and it will have a section on how **conflict is handled**. Most of the time it's through some sort of social engineering, shaming or banishment. But the point is that anarchism and socialism acknowledge that conflict will still happen, and therefore hypothesize mechanisms to resolve said conflicts.


They are not Utopian in the respect that we are discussing, because neither claim "removing all conflict" as a goal.


Legitimized coercion is coercion that you cannot respond to with self defense in a way that is compliant with the law of the land.
@_date: 2013-07-28 04:06:22


Please link me to relevant literature. I have never heard of them.
And it does matter. Because if your ideals call for no viable form of socio-economic organization, then your litmus test is too strong. (Or criticisms based on it are worthless.)


Of course it makes a difference. If the government is pointing a gun at you, you have no recourse. If you retaliate, you're thrown in jail and you're stuck  **without legal recourse**. That's legitimized coercion. If it's illegitimate coercion, then you can retaliate in self defense without fear of being jailed.
I honestly cannot shake the feeling that you are being purposefully obtuse. Every single one of my comments has been about drawing a distinction between coercion because someone wants to be bad and coercion because it's backed by the law of the land. You continue to persist and say the same thing over and over again: "I don't care what kind of coercion is imposed on me."
So what? So what if you don't care? That doesn't mean a distinction doesn't exist in the context of socio-economic organization. I mean, for chrissake, the crescendo of anarcho-capitalism is **realizing that there is no moral difference between taxation and thievery**. The idea is to treat all coercion the same. **Statism** is what imposes the distinction that justifies one form of coercion over another. So your perpetual response here is an indictment of statism and **not** anarcho-capitalism.
I'll say that again.
**Statism** is what imposes the distinction that justifies one form of coercion over another. **Not** anarcho-capitalism.
@_date: 2013-07-26 23:50:35


Good golly. Agnosticism isn't a synonym for "I haven't made up my mind" or "I'm a fence sitter." It means that you're stating something about *knowledge*. Namely, that you don't think certain ideas are *knowable*. In terms of the existence of God, it means that you think the answer **cannot be known** (probably to some reasonable standard of evidence). It does not mean, "I'm not sure yet." To be agnostic about political philosophies would be saying that you believe there is no way to answer the question as to which one is the best. (But this does not preclude advocating one based on moral principles.)
Let's revisit your *language* again then...


So if you want me to be *semantically* correct, just replace all of my claims about you rejecting something to "not being convinced of something". Everything else holds, including being deceptive about whether you're asking a genuine question or not.


I'm quite frankly tired of your aloof comments. How about you state what they are? I can then point out how they are Utopian.


Well you did. That's what happens when you, ya know, specifically cite it as the target of your criticism.


That's the point! **No kind of coercion is OK.** Anarcho-capitalism is about the abolition of the ***LEGITIMIZATION*** of coercion. I don't know how many times I have to say that. This was the initial thing I was trying to correct when I first responded to you. I've since said it several times, but you refuse to acknowledge this point.
The whole idea of **statism** is that there are some kinds of coercion that are acceptable, namely, coercion from governments. Anarcho-capitalism is about abolishing **acceptable** forms of coercion and privatizing the **process of resolution** when coercion does happen.
On the other hand, some kinds of **force or threat of force** are explicitly OK. Namely, force used in the face of coercion. i.e., self-defense.
There is no coercive trade going on. With governments, you are coerced by governments and evil people. Without governments, you are coerced by evil people. Get it?
@_date: 2013-07-26 19:19:08
............ Because it would otherwise be Utopian..........
Solving all the world's ills requires eliminating all conflict. That is, as far as I'm concerned, impossible. The human species as a whole would have to reach a new level of consciousness. If you believe in that kind bullshit, then awesome. But it otherwise really has no place in a serious discussion of socio-economic organization.
Otherwise, I have a really hard time believing you really asked a *genuine* question. You completely ignored the rest of my comment. More to the point, you cited a reason to dismiss anarcho-capitalism which could also be used to dismiss every other non-Utopian socio-economic system. Lest you be declared a hypocrite!
