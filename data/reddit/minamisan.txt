So Tim Swanson is head of research for R3, which is exploring distributed ledger technology for financial institutions. Wasn't it only natural that this sort of tech would branch out in all directions to serve all kinds of purposes? 
Everyone needs to realize, if big banks got into Bitcoin they'd own it, and you wouldn't. Tim is probably doing us all a favor by keeping them focussed on other things.

It's going to be a tough sell getting Japanese consumers to try something new when they already have store points, Rakuten super points and about five different functional e-cash card systems that are accepted in a surprising number of places.

Whenever some glitch strikes a service like this or Blockchain.info it highlights the advantages of an online bitcoin solution *where you always get to keep your private keys*. I simply took the brainwallet seed from the KryptoKit backup, turned it into a private key &amp; swept it with Blockchain. Google can do what they like with the extension (which as Mike Hearn said is probably just some automated system overreacting) but I still have all my bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-03-27 04:56:40

I've often wondered about this. The only stats I ever see quoted are from that initial Robocoin, and yeah, it'd be ludicrous for anyone to expect their own ATM to generate that kind of cash now there are hundreds worldwide.
I often hear anecdotes of ATMs (usually Lamassus) sitting semi-abandoned in cafes, out of order or with staff who claim not to know anything about them - and others that apparently do brisk business.
The same, it must be said, goes for businesses that 'accept bitcoin'.

I don't think of bitcoin as being this year's worst investment any more than I thought of it being last year's best one. In a similar vein, while I didn't think last year's hype was any reason to believe BTC value would rise exponentially forever, I don't regard this year's slumps as a sign of doom. As an asset class, bitcoin is scarcely even born and it is far from understood. No analysis for any time period to date can do it justice; nothing like it has ever existed before.
@_date: 2014-07-19 23:32:22
'Robustness' doesn't have the same nuance at all. It just means something that is strong against, or resistant to pressure. 'Antifragility' is a different phenomenon whereby something actually *gains* strength from adversity, whether aimed at it directly or from general volatility.

Well the idea is to get bitcoins into the hands of people who haven't used it or haven't considered it before. So asking them to sign up for a bitFlyer account is probably less of an imposition than asking them to learn about bitcoin, choose their own wallet and supply an address all by themselves.

The number in KryptoKit is the 'seed' that creates a private key. To import it into Blockchain, you need to convert it into a private key. Sites like bitcoinpaperwallet.org can do it -- skip the first step &amp; then go to the 'Validate' tab. Paste the 'seed' in there &amp; it will generate keys (you'll notice the public key is the same one you already knew). Copy the address that starts with '5' (this is the private key) &amp; import that into your Blockchain.info account.

Current conditions for tax and bitcoin in Australia are the result of a Tax Office ruling, not government policy. The current Senate inquiry shows bitcoin has a degree of bi-partisan support, so I'm still hopeful the laws will be changed to allow cryptocurrencies to grow. Online sales from overseas are still tax-exempt in Australia despite howlings from the retail industry, so there's still a chance they'll do the right thing.

Boase was correct, attempting to introduce a fully-operational bitcoin economy in places like Kenya is not going to work (just as true now as it was in 2014).

Bitcoin XT is a fork of Bitcoin Core, built by devs who were frustrated at some deadlocks on the original project. At this point XT works almost exactly like Core, though in future there is the possibility it will differ significantly, mainly by allowing larger blocks, forcing miners to choose between the two (and hopefully choosing XT).

It was from a time when bitcoin was still a close-knit 'community' and participants stood by each others' businesses whether they were invested or not, in order to protect the budding industry's reputation. It wouldn't have served anyone's purpose to have the world's most popular BTC exchange go down because... well you saw what eventually happened.
As Roger said, he saw Gox's fiat bank balances only, and reported accurately what he saw. If anyone outside the company could've seen the BTC side of things then, all hell would've broken loose a lot earlier.

If you think back to when the video appeared, the issue was USD withdrawals and the difficulty of getting them to US customers. At that stage, no-one ever suspected there was a problem with Gox's actual bitcoin stash.

I hate to break it to those who live in hope, but you will never hear from the 'real' Satoshi again unless he is somehow revealed (which I also think is unlikely).

I'm assuming you probably want to exchange those bitcoins for local currency at some stage. It depends where you live, some countries are easier than others. An exchange will make you use ID. Or you could find a trustworthy local dealer who will trade in person, using LocalBitcoins or a meetup in your area. Unfortunately you have to trade off some security for privacy here.

Mt Gox actually lost over 850,000 BTC, not dollars. 200,000 was later recovered from a lost wallet, but 650,000 in customer funds remain missing. And yeah, these amounts are unrelated to the $5m in seizures by the US govt, which happened in mid-2013.

It's not PayPal's fault, it's the regulations the company has to suffer under, or else the whole thing gets shut down.
