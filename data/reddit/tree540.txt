Having worked for a major crypto company I can say that most receive BBB complaints.  This involves more work for the company in dealing with the BBB and their dated procedures.  The crypto company may have to spend more time doing mindless work for the BBB rather then actually solving the customer's problem.  It's unfortunate this vicious cycle continues to play out over and over and really hurts both parties while the BBB adds to it's pocketbooks.

If the developers of Maza focused on building TRUST instead of personal WEALTH then perhaps this coin would of fared better.

bitcoin is not just a currency but a technology protocol.  Not all applications of this new protocol have to do with currency or store of value.  Regulating a technology that has not had a chance to fully develop and not allowing people to use open source software in the manner they choose sets a dangerous precedent.

My response to Wells after getting a denial to my RSVP...
"As a PMA customer in NYC it's sometimes tough to even find a branch or ATM.  Access to funds is everything.  I co-host bitcoin meetups here in the city.  If we go over capacity then we find another venue.  This is all with no budget.
If you are able to find any space for a customer I would love to attend.
Thanks again."
@_date: 2014-01-25 00:13:58
I believe I was also at that meetup in NYC at the Belfry.  I was one of the men you described.  I welcome new people of all kinds to this event every week and do my best to keep the environment fun and friendly.  I'm not sure I completely agree with your recollection of the events.  I apologize if you felt uncomfortable, that was certainly not my intention.  However, I can only speak for MY actions.  I never touched you once.  I only pointed out that you were a very rational / logical thinking female which you agreed with.  You then went on to explain in detail your family's awareness of this difference when you were a child.  I wasn't under the impression that you were offended when you continued to elaborate on the topic.  As a host for the event I do my best to keep the conversation going.  It doesn't mean I find you attractive or I want to date you.  Again, I'm sorry if you felt insulted as you were smiling and speaking with me.  I'm not saying I'm perfect.  We're all human.  But next time you should try voicing your opinion instead of smiling like everything is fine and then raging on the internet later.  If we meet again, the first drink is on me.  :)
@_date: 2014-11-10 17:53:51

Why would they NOT want the extra attention and business?  In my eyes this turns an old dusty brand into a smart and forward thinking business.

It may also be notable that the OP works for Facebook who has violated my trust on several occasions.  I finally deleted my FB account for this reason.  Consider, why is this Facebook employee so determined to spread this negative article about bitcoin meetups across multiple platforms?  What is the true motive?  Why would a Facebook employee write a negative article which questions the credibility of a successful Meetup.com group?  In the same way Uber trolled their competitors, Facebook could be doing the same thing here.

See, you may have insight into traditional payment systems that most people do not.  Instead of educating others you choose to belittle them.  It's actually somewhat similar to what Pay Pal does themselves.  You have an opportunity to enlighten others and share helpful, specific information.

Let me try to clarify my position in a more sensitive manner.  Women are better at some things then men and vice versa.  Testosterone and estrogen are different and enable us in different ways.  If you want to talk about crypto currency then please do.  I'd encourage it and I'd be happy to talk to you.  Your gender is not important.  Discussing an ultra awareness of gender around ANY topic actually distracts from the actual subject which a person is trying to be a part of (unless it's a fundamental inequality issue within the topic at hand).

I've also run into this problem with a $20 chargeback fee while the item being charged back was under $5.  Pay Pal claimed that some financial institutions will charge them 60-100 dollars and they are being generous by only passing down a $20 fee to me.  Riiiiiiight.  I do see chargebacks without such fees so I'm not sure what exactly triggers these $20 fees.  Perhaps a particular third party financial institution?

I believe big bank customer money is stolen is the exact same way.  Highly unlikely that the FDIC covers all fraud situations.  More and more as the future progresses, if people do not educate themselves about computers and security then they will fall to all sorts of issues caused by a choice to stay uneducated.

Ben Lawsky's face will be embedded in every transaction with the words, "NSA hires all the mathematicians, in math we trust".

The true argument revolves around software development.  Paper money doesn't move well thru an increasing online world economy.  Crypto is just code.  You can hide it behind layers of accepted software usability.  The blockchain is a powerful base of development that goes far beyond basic ideas of currency.  Dig deeper.  ;)

Crypto is offering much better security options then most traditional banks.  For example, you can't get 2-factor at most banks.  So this is more about FDIC insurance I guess.

Mt.Gox verification is nothing new.  Fairly recently, but before this blanket statement about verification, I deposited funds into my Gox account.
