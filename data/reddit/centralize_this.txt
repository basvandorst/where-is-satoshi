A bubble is when an asset (or asset class) persistently trades above what the fundamentals would dictate. The US dollar is backed by coercive force. In a free market, its value would be...zero. Bitcoin is fundamentally undervalued and going through price discovery.

Depends on your level of crime. If HSBC is laundering money for you, then fiat is probably better...for now.

They won't destroy it. They will collar the price, like Gold. This is win/win for them. They can fleece investors on futures and wash, rinse, repeat. Their handlers are happy because competition for fiat has been neutralized.

They don't need to attack Bitcoin in the media anymore. They have the futures market coming. Wall Street is going to make Bitcoin its bitch. Jamie Dimon will say "I told you so" with a smug smile on his face. As the sheep get shorn they will finally get a realization of what us Gold stackers have had to endure. And nobody will believe us.

You need to learn some history. The Hunt brothers saw that the Comex couldn't possibly deliver on outstanding "physical" Silver contracts (sound familiar?) in 1980, so they started massively buying the market. Foolishly, they used leverage. The market rules were changed overnight and they were bankrupted. Read the article "Silver Finger" to learn how this went down.

To get an idea of what most "balanced portfolio" investing normies think of Bitcoin, have a look at this:
From a somewhat well known Canadian blog.

This is a purely cash settled market. Delivery has nothing to do with it. There is no delivery, therefore no short squeeze. The price of real Bitcoin can be created through the manipulation of futures "Bitcoin". Just like Gold. If we had price discovery in Gold, it would be an order of magnitude higher in price. This is terrible news for Bitcoin.

"Cryptocurrencies don't facilitate the transfer of money between savers and borrowers, banks do that."
No they don't. Banks create money ex nihilo. Loans beget deposits. When is the last time your bank account balance dropped because the bank was loaning out your money? Let me guess...never?

The same way they help central banks control the price of Gold. The mechanism is identical. Naked short as many contracts as you like without having to back them up with anything. The CME "spot" price becomes the globally quoted price. The timing makes perfect sense given that B2X is looking increasingly dead on arrival.

This will be the death of Bitcoin. The tail wagging the dog. Watch Wall Street whales come in and naked short hundreds of millions in "cash settled" contracts, with zero risk in actual Bitcoins and the full bailout backing of the Fed if there is a hint of trouble. This is how Gold was effectively killed.
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:06:33
Yes. Look at the Gold market. The Silver market is actually worse. There is a massive perpetual concentrated short position that would not be tolerated in any other commodity.

I think people might not be taking this attack seriously enough. Realistically, this is their last serious kick at the can with this attack vector. They are going to throw everything they have at it. People say they won't mine at a loss for any extended period of time, but I disagree. Bitmain are state sponsored. They will mine for as long as it takes to get the BTC ticker. They will also attack the proper chain. I think their goal will be to try to force a proof of work change. That will make bitcoin lose its name to them and they won't care if their hardware is bricked on the forked legacy chain because they will have the new dominant chain, which will be called "Bitcoin" by the exchanges. This is their last shot and they know it.

It will be great for bankster price discovery.

Does the manipulation of Gold matter if I keep coins in my safety deposit box?
