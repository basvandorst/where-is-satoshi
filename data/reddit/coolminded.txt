I agree, which is why I'm trying to switch to OpenBaazar. And, I can always use my bitcoins for an Amazon gift card on Gyft. 
Oh, and Purse technical support sucks. They won't let me change my email from the old email that no longer exist due to a shutdown, to my new email. Took forever to wait for a response back from technical support on why I can't verify my new email through my new email.

I did an anti-virus scan on my installer, came out find. But, I'm having trouble installing the store onto my Windows. Tried clicking to have it installed and it wouldn't come up.

It's very hard to buy bitcoins. The last I want is to wire money from my bank. I know it may sound bullshit you, but I found it easy to transfer the money I made from PayPal and convert them to bitcoin using VirWoX. The only crappy thing is my credit card is not accepted on that site when trying to buy bitcoins.

I did not hear back from "Purl Soho" about my inquiry. I did contact an independent business that sells knitting patterns if they consider accepting bitcoin. I haven't heard back from them either.

I'll give it a few months of success before I sell my vinyl on that site. I tried selling a record at StuffCoin, and that didn't work out ಠ_ಠ

(￣ー￣)//”” 2 stores, that's a step up!
@_date: 2014-07-19 13:06:46
Thanks for the offer, but I'm saving my bitcoin for something else. Bitcoin is great for people visiting in other countries. I think it also great for spinners and international yarn companies to find a broader audience without exchange and transaction fees.  
@_date: 2014-11-01 23:00:46
Quickwallet sucks. I'm having a hard time sending bitcoin as it keep failing the transaction. When I want help I click on the online support I get either nothing or the front page. 
The last thing I want is to get scam like I did with EasyCoin. And I still have bitcoins in there. Which I can't access. 
@_date: 2014-07-19 02:13:09
I have seen that too. That's a good link for people who get their yarn at super craft stores. I was also thinking of shops that have other brands. Debbie Bliss, Spud &amp; Chloe, Manos del Uruguay, Noro, Sweet Georgia. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 12:32:38
Me too! I'll try on the Tor browser.
@_date: 2014-05-01 01:07:54
Plan on donating a few bitcoins. This is way better than wiring money for people in other countries who want to help.
@_date: 2014-03-29 02:01:46
Holy Shit! I was mislead by the title. I live in a town called Havelock. I've just sign up 2 bitcoin wallets. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 17:25:28
Even my Tor browser has an untrusted connection to openbazaar.org.
@_date: 2014-05-01 01:15:25
Wonder if they accept bitcoin （＾_－）ｄ
@_date: 2014-06-12 17:25:00
Just bookmark! If I need food I will follow the path. Take that Amazon!

Now with the new update I can finally open the app on my desktop rather than going through files just to open the app.

Ah fuck, I just read about this after watching Tomorrowland. Despite how crazy he was, he's still and always a genius. The mind knows how to play us.
@_date: 2014-06-13 12:39:44
That's cool, except they don't recognize private bitcoin wallets. I know, I have a private bitcoin wallet on my Tor browser. I put in my bitcoin address and they didn't show the amount I have.  
@_date: 2016-03-04 13:38:54
Since I rarely use my cell for anything other than making calls, text and random app shit I don't have a bitcoin wallet for the phone. Also, I'm the rare resident of Eastern North Carolina that use/have bitcoin. So, no place in my area accept bitcoin.
But, I do have Electrum on my computer. You set your own fees and the transaction are very smooth. Your btc value does change on a daily basis. Just try to put little money every so often. Cause you never know how the value going to be the next day. 
@_date: 2016-06-24 01:51:38
I'll sign. With a track my state been having I might as well use a VPN for all my bitcoin needs.
@_date: 2019-12-26 12:57:33
Thanks I just sign up.
@_date: 2016-09-20 23:30:36
It's Vista, but OpenBazaar told me it's not compatible with that OS. 
@_date: 2016-09-19 23:46:24
None, since my computer won't accept OpenBazaar. Seriously considering a Linux computer in order to get OpenBazaar. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 16:02:52
It not just Amazon gift cards, I do exchange my bitcoin for money.
@_date: 2015-09-06 00:31:52
True. I'm not a very good tech person. Maybe a hacker group can work around the sanctions. Giving the money these people need.
@_date: 2018-07-04 16:01:23
That'd be nice to move out. The crappy part about that is I don't have a driver license. I have a job, but I don't have the financial resources to do so (besides having bitcoin). 
@_date: 2018-07-04 15:58:11
true that
@_date: 2018-07-04 15:57:48
I remember back when it was 60K.
@_date: 2015-03-27 17:46:32
Somewhat true. I have made purchases on the darkmarkets that have not rip me off. There are things I like you can't get online. Like hacked accounts, EMP jammers, anonymous wifi hotspots, etc. I have also used my bitcoins to make donation to online privacy oriented group. At one time I did use it as a gift card to make a purchase on Amazon. I'm trying be less dependent on credit cards.  
@_date: 2015-09-06 00:29:01
I'm sorry, for being a concerned cunt watching this shit unfolding on the news. I don't work for a charity. I have a 9-5 job like everyone else. I also have bitcoin like most people. I just through a question out there because of how widespread the situation is getting. 
@_date: 2015-03-27 13:12:54
I've been doing the same thing. But, I recently postpone buying bitcoin due to the shit that went down in EVO on Tor. I will go back to buying bitcoin as soon as things settle down on Tor and other markets. Coming from a person who work in government contract for $11 an hour.
