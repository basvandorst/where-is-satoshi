Can you transfer out of Robinhood though? If you don't hold it it's not yours.

Doesn't mining get easy if you get a few thousand dollars worth of gear though? Something bigger?

Thank you so much! May I ask your outcome of a 24 hour mining period in BTC? And I use guiminer would that work the same with the USB miners or would I also have to get another miner or how does that part work?

Better the gambling and buying other shit I dont need

Oh, sorry and thanks, quick question I looked at that subreddit and it seemed like a bunch were going to buy miners and everything if it wont be that profitable why buy, why not just use an exchange?

Okay thanks, those two symbols are the ones i wasn't sure on because i have always seen the ฿ but now i sometimes see the Ƀ. Thanks!!

If I use Ƀ or the baht would people know what im talking about either way because currently I just use BTC but I would rather use a character/symbol
