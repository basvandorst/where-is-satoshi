Given that a number of the mining pools that are concerned with bandwidth costs and orphans in the event of a lifting of the Bitcoin blocksize cap also mine Litecoin, and that there is a potential for an increase in Litecoin transactions as a Bitcoin substitute should Bitcoin tx traffic start to become consistently congested, is perhaps lowering the Litecoin blocksize cap something that is on the table?

It's not, because you're challenging the validity of his model by claiming counterexample to the conclusions of his model, i.e. making the argument that it does not hold up empirically. That is literally exactly what you're saying in the passages I quoted. Specifically you're asserting that supply is price inelastic. The kind of argument that you're making there is fundamentally of a different nature than the a priori theory built up in Peter R's paper, and it has to be substantiated empirically to be a critique that anyone can take seriously.

I think the only compromise that makes sense at this point is a modest blocksize increase that can go into effect within say 1 - 1.5 years, the reason being that the user experience and overlay protocols are not remotely ready to support any kind of fee market, and these ideas need more time to flesh out how they would actually work. We really do need to kick the can down the road a little bit because of this discrepancy.
The main reason it appears to me that we can't have nice things is that the small block side is so ultra-ideological, that it scares people advocating relaxing the cap into thinking they may never be able to accomplish it ever again, so there is tremendous incentive to try to make needlessly-aggressive cap increases or some kind of long-term schedule right now.

This reaction has nothing to do with Bitcoin, it has 100% to do with the organizer having to maintain dominance in the face of a new threat to his deal. If you had proposed lecturing about say differential equations or matrices he would've found a completely different justification, but likely would've snubbed and disrespected you all the same. The way that you get a Bitcoin lecture going in this kind of circumstance is casually talking to the person in charge and building a repore, and at some point mentioning an interest in Bitcoin, and subtly you can weave it as though it's non-threatening and having a Bitcoin talk is his idea. People are often defensive and weird about their stuff, and unless you really hit it off personally with the dude in charge, it's hard to imagine how being a newcomer cold pitching a lecture would possibly go anywhere.

Nobody is claiming that simply having a supply curve creates a market, because that's not a thing. I would look into the assumptions behind the basic market models in introductory microeconomics.
Secondly oxygen is actually a terrible example of what you're trying to demonstrate, because it has non-rival / non-excludible public good qualities that muddy the analogy beyond recognition, and these are things that are actually studied theoretically in economics. The concept that you're trying to communicate is called price elasticity.

There is really no such thing as a "libertarian" fee market here, because the notion of there being a "market" when supply can't increase in response to rising prices is a bizarre perversion. A market created by an artificial cap resembles the economics of a perfect cartel that could never exist in the physical world, whereas a fee market where supply is bounded by the decisions of miners in light of a marginal cost in orphan probability is a real market where marginal supply gets more and more expensive but can actually happen in response to demand.

Because this approach has all the same issues as a hard fork, but pays for being able to call the entire thing a single Bitcoin with remarkable complexity that has the potential to radically undermine the user experience. If users do adopt the extension block scheme, then all user-facing programs and interfaces have to be rewritten, and it's unclear how it would be communicated to a user what exact block extension scheme a particular service or software is using. If the ecosystem adopts some kind of heterogeneity then this fragmentation could be very similar to a number of hard forks, where all we've done is preserve the concept of a soft fork in name. If the majority of participants adopt the same block extension parameters, but say some miners or services don't, then we've basically reinvented a hard fork where the larger blocks basically won, but at the expense of a weaker security model, because 1 MB holdouts still participate but contribute no security to the larger tx volume. This seems like a lot of weird and unexplored dynamics that reinvent very similar problems just to prevent addressing the politics of hard forking.

The energy consumption of Bitcoin issuing money is not unique whatsoever, it's just that with Bitcoin the reality that it's happening is done extremely transparently.
When money is issued into existence by the Fed in order to monetize debt, now the government is able to demand energy and resources commensurate with that dollar amount. That's just the seigniorage alone,  not to consider the macroeconomic distortions that drive energy and resource consumption, as central banking endeavors to manipulate artificial growth through lax credit policies.

That's not a vanity address, that's specifically an address where the text was invented and the appropriate checksum was appended. The purpose of this kind of address is to prove that you're destroying the funds, because there is no reasonable way to have generated this address while having the private key.
Vanity addresses on the other hand are generated by stand-alone software or vanity pools that brute force attack the key space to find a private key that produces an address that matches your prefix criteria. This gets exponentially harder and harder the more characters you want to specify, to the point where very quickly it becomes impossible.

Using the word "checkpoint" analogously to a military "checkpoint" is mentally-retarded beyond all hope. 
Bitcoin itself has used checkpoints and it's totally fine, unless you believe that a blockchain re-org of a length that is less likely than the universe imploding into the shape of a pink elephant then re-exploding to the exact state it is now is somehow possible.
In the context Mike Hearn is talking about, checkpointing would simply be a technique to ensure that the new-fork clients stay on the chain with big blocks regardless of what the 1 MB chain is doing. That's entirely the desired behavior to someone who consciously decided to change to a big block fork, and is just addressing a nitty-gritty detail about how this scenario plays out at first in practice.

I don't know but I think that your theory that it's some tracking/compliance company is extremely plausible for two reasons:
1) Sending a small output like that would be tremendously effective at tainting another address in an external wallet for a user that isn't sophisticated enough to understand how to avoid the situation;
2) There is no way in hell any company like Circle or Coinbase is possibly legal in the US even now, much less when they first started operating, so they absolutely must have some over-zealous backroom deals with regulators regarding AML/KYC. There is no way for any US citizen to start a company like that legally even with millions of dollars to hire the right lawyers and do all the right filings (the procedures to get licensed don't even fully exist), but these guys can because of their multimillionaire-plus VC connections cutting backroom deals.

They absolutely do in the most basic fundamentals of why and how they exist. I strongly recommend for example listening to Adam Back's interview with Andreas on LTB over a year ago where he discusses development paradigms and the idea of applying a one-way peg to testnet. 
Sidechains came out of this idea, and the foundational use-case for sidechains is as a low-risk testing environment to address what is perceived as a sluggishness in core development. You can literally see this exactly scrolling through the graphic depiction on the bottom of the front page of the blockstream website, although listening or reading Adam Back describe the evolution and rationale of sidechains is much more in depth obviously than a simple diagram.
Lighthouse is obviously a completely different animal technologically, but it was motivated by trying to solve exactly the same problem, by trying to provide a crowd-sourced way to fund core development. 
These are not mutually-exclusive approaches obviously, but from the sheer amount of vitriol for Mike Hearn in trying to make Lighthouse to begin with (which is exactly what caused XT to exist in the first place), it stands to reason that the question of how you facilitate or incentivize development is potentially highly contentious in light of the fact that sidechains are developed by a VC-funded company that directly employs several core devs, and ostensibly has no use for competing crowd-funding schemes.
@_date: 2015-06-09 02:17:09
The impression that I got listening to Mike Hearn was more that resolving the debate itself is irrelevant, because the problem at hand is that any one of a small group of devs can veto anything, so it's not going to be possible to get any change like this done in the current development framework. It's fine for people to disagree, but that just means unfortunately that people have to fork the project and part ways.

I feel like the emotions of devs are holding the userbase hostage. It's time for a fork. If certain devs are against it, they're perfectly entitled to that opinion and nobody is forcing them to participate in anything they don't want to. If it turns out they were right and the big block fork is a disaster, then so be it, more power to them. But the gamesmanship creating massive ideological rants against relaxing that arbitrary cap I feel is abusive and insensitive to a userbase that wants to use Bitcoin and feels like at least some modest medium-term growth in usage is desirable.

The act of bringing fiat currencies into existence generally involves immediately consuming energy and resources (in seigniorage spending as the first hands the new money touches). For example, suppose the Fed monetizes some debt, they literally create new money to give to the Treasury in exchange for debt securities. What does the Treasury do now? The government immediately consumes energy, resources, and labor with that money that was just created.
This is no different in principle than Bitcoin whatsoever, but at least in the case of Bitcoin, the energy and capex consumption is done ahead of time to get the seigniorage in the first place (and thus not hidden behind obfuscated governmental structures), and in the process of consuming those resources produces a public good in terms of system security.

The blocksize cap is not what increases on-chain supply. Miners are who provide the supply of tx clearing. Relaxing the cap only removes the production quota that prevents miners from including transactions in their blocks that they would've otherwise if not throttled.
This is more than just a semantic distinction, because I think the conflation of these ideas is exactly why blocksize cap and the actual size of blocks are very deliberately switched to distort the issues.

That's kind of a weird and presumptuous way to look at it. The person advocating larger blocksize is not doing so to manage mempool size, it's just that the heretofore unknown edge cases of failure modes due to operating at blocksize capacity has never been a practical issue in the engineering ever before, so the burden is on the status quo blocksize camp to demonstrate that such a client can be worked out in time.

It's a very natural fit, because the proof-of-work scheme that Bitcoin uses was originally conceived as an anti-spam mechanism, whereas Bitcoin uses it more as sybil-prevention scheme for randomly assigning who gets to produce the next block.

The "big block" position has already won by default. If maintaining 1MB were a viable position, then we would be seeing commits to address full node behavior operating at capacity, as there is non-trivial engineering that needs to be done to allow Bitcoin Core to work properly at capacity with an indeterminately large mempool. Since no such work is actually being done, there is no choice but to go the larger block route. The 1MB-capacity client simply doesn't exist.

The 20MB number is probably in large part because Gavin is afraid he will not be able revisit forking it higher in the future. If the five biggest Chinese pools are receptive to actively dealing with this issue in the future (as suggested by the Huobi rep's remarks quoted in the Cointelegraph article), then there isn't necessarily a problem solving the block size situation in a few steps over time like this. Furthermore, those comments indicate that if the Core dev team doesn't address blocksize, the Chinese pools could just do it themselves.

In reality there is no successful open source project that I'm aware of that has a distributed setup like this. The decentralization is expressed by what version fork of a given software project users adopt, it has nothing to do with the ideological concept that the development of any given fork/version is leaderless.

There will never ever ever ever be a solution to the "nothing at stake" problem because it is a fundamental problem of economic opportunity cost not existing.

This observation is not only true in a deflationary supply situation, but also universally true with respect to time preference and the subjectivity of utility (which is something you bring up a little later, but I don't think people appreciate this point).
The entire purpose of storing value is the use-case that there is something you don't want right now, but will likely want in the future. For example if you just ate, you're not going to want to a meal for a while. If you just bought a new car, you are not likely to value another new car until your current car gets sufficiently old to require more maintenance and repair than you're willing to accept.
Economies don't up and collapse because people fail to spend everything all the time, and if what the typical sophomoric bitcoin commentator believed was indicative of success actually happened to say the dollar economy, we would be in a world-ending economic crisis of previously-unknown proportions.

Money = Currency exactly in this context, the only reason we think otherwise is authorities have made up some kind of distinction out of nowhere in order to FUD Bitcoin. For example they seem to have manufactured some fake market-share test of whether something qualifies as a currency, that has absolutely no basis in the underlying economics concepts, or they confuse empirically-observed deficiencies in the criteria for a useful money as a test for status as a "currency" which is even more baffling.
The actual distinction that has any economic reality is that "currency" represents the form that is in circulation (hence "currency") used as a medium of exchange. The distinction is most obvious in the antiquated gold-backed scenario, where you have banknotes and coins (currency) versus bullion (which is money but not currency).
There is no such distinction in Bitcoin because the commodity itself is directly transferable without resorting to an intermediary currency instrument, therefore the bitcoin itself always is both the money and the currency. In this respect, the name "Bitcoin" was actually exactly correct, because it has the properties of both a money and a currency at the same time, exactly like a coin.

The branding as a  "token sale " is totally disingenuous, because if a person wanted the tokens to develop or use apps and contracts, he would simply acquire them once the system actually started running. The only reason someone would join the crowdsale at this point where the tokens are unusable and untradeable is the expectation that they will rise in value above the arbitrary 2000 ether : 1 bitcoin figure. You can deny it in manipulatively-chosen wording all you want, it doesn't change the reality that the Ethereum project is hugely benefitting financially by tacitly encouraging this expectation.
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:05:36
Once this actually happens, the is the most medium-term bullish news in the entire history of bitcoin, because despite the short-term price suppression surrounding the sale, the mere fact that a sale is happening in the first place projects the message to the general public that the US government believes not only is Bitcoin a "real" thing, but has a value that they want to recoup by actually conducting a sale.

The other is the same quantity of money chasing more goods/services, which can only happen under economic growth. These two scenarios have absolutely nothing to do with each other, because the price deflation that arises out of fixed money supply requires economic growth to even happen in the first place.

It's not necessarily about outright prediction, it's a hedging strategy. These kind of prediction market bets are like derivatives, by strategizing the numbers right, you create an effect similar to a CFD. By always betting some portion of your holdings on the low-price bet, you give up some gains (lower total number of BTC should the higher price be achieved) for gains in BTC should the price underperform.

The purpose of this technology is entirely wrapped up in the incentives. All the participants collectively supply the infrastructure by acting in their own self interest, upon which anybody can build technologies and services. There is no point to some centralized institution creating their own blockchain-based system because they are losing the economic advantage of hitching their cart to an open system like Bitcoin. A centralized organization doesn't need to create a trusttless transparent ledger, they just create proprietary databases.

It's really ironic that pretty much all of the tired sophomoric objections to Bitcoin truly actually apply to ApplePay. ApplePay doesn't actually offer any kind of value proposition to the consumer whatsoever, it's truly a solution looking for a problem. In a practical sense, the only convenience would come from the iPhone completely replacing your wallet, but in a world of driver's licenses and other ID cards, that is not a realistic possibility. From the perspective of everyday brick-and-mortar usage, ApplePay offers the consumer absolutely nothing different than *exactly* what the hardware in a modern credit card does. On the merchant side, ApplePay does do something to reduce fraud risk, but nowhere near what Bitcoin does by being a completely different kind of system.
Whereas with Bitcoin, even the most mundane "1.0" applications of it are absolutely revolutionary compared to ApplePay. With sufficient adoption, you'd be able to land in another country and just seamlessly pay whatever you need from a mobile phone or NFC-enabled card. You can pay people anywhere whenever you want practically instantly. The fact that settlement is basically guaranteed irreversible once you make it to a sufficient block depth is absolutely revolutionary for a lot of applications. Not even scratching the surface here of how useful the most mundane aspects of Bitcoin would be in a real world of significant adoption.
Whereas Apple just "innovated" a way to fingerprint yourself on an over-priced phone to do the exact same thing you would accomplish by swiping or placing a modern credit card in proximity.

I don't worry about the distribution of bitcoin whatsoever, because the inequality is merely a bootstrapping mechanism inherent to early adoption. There is nothing inherent to the Bitcoin protocol itself that produces inequality, so naturally over time as early adopters take profits in fiat and/or goods and services, that disparity naturally goes away. I see it similar to concerns about volatility, in that there is nothing inherent to bitcoin that produces price volatility, and this just comes with the territory of being early days in adoption.

Bitcoin mining ASICs can't brute force anything to do with finding address collisions or reversing address -&gt; public key -&gt; private key. All Bitcoin miners do is a double SHA256, and bitcoin mining itself is basically just a brute force preimage attack against the target. Performing double SHA256 quickly would help you on just two parts of taking a random private key from the key space and looking for a collision against existing addresses in use, but you would still be rate limited anyway by your ability to do the checksums and RIPEMD. Even if all there was to searching for address collisions was performing one sha256d, the current hashrate of the entire Bitcoin network would take about 4.6x10^24 years to exhaustively search a 2^160 keyspace.

What you're describing is not what "selfish mining" actually means. It's a theoretical attack described in a 2013 academic paper that involves block withholding as a means to exclusively pre-mine further down the chain with the intention of releasing multiple blocks (longer than the main consensus chain) as a shortcut to the 51% attack. What you're doing isn't "selfish mining", it's just being a dick and defrauding totally innocent miners who have every right to use ghash if they choose.

Your quickest options would be to deploy existing open source pool software such as eloipool or p2pool, but I don't think zero fees is really what's driving miners to ghash.

Email didn't become a thing just to give you free access through an isp in the mid-90's, it became ubiquitous to the point where you could even have it because of years of businesses gradually finding value in getting on it. That's the point of what people are saying here. The network effects that establish adoption do not necessarily even involve regular individuals until way down the line. To answer your question, by the time something like Bitcoin became totally mainstream, your usage of it might be so behind-the-scenes through financial services companies, trusttless payment channels, DAOs, or just some currently unforseen software design paradigm, etc. that you might not even actually have to know or even care that you're using Bitcoin. It's almost exactly like email, that's why this is such a powerful analogy.

Even the term "issue" is weird for Bitcoin, because it itself is the underlying asset, nobody is issuing anything... again unless we're talking about a broker custodially holding funds, in which case when you buy bitcoins, until the point where you actually withdrew the underlying to your own address, they did in fact "issue" you a claim on bitcoins.

This is incorrect, bitcoin is backed by nothing because it itself is the commodity, the concept of backing doesn't even make sense. 
Backing means that an instrument is issued that is guaranteed redeemable for a certain amount of commodity money. Bitcoin is not a promissory note, it's a money that can function as currency, exactly like real precious metal coins.
Bank notes (which would make sense to talk about "backing", in the context of not being fiat) are currency but not money, because the money is the backing, not the note.

I don't think they would ever do this, because the advantages that we currently see in Bitcoin are not advantages to them. They can arbitrarily create whatever kind of basket of currencies they want and administer it exactly as they like. These nations have more than enough human capital to produce their own centralized proprietary international clearing system. Where Bitcoin may come into the picture is not these nations chosing to adopt it and manipulate its value to fit the use case, but possibly adopting it in some way after Bitcoin has achieved some level of near-universal recognizability and high market capitalization on its own.

I don't find this idea plausible because barring very extreme profitability swings, with ASICs it's always the units nearing the end of their productive life cycle that get shut down, and pervasive hardware shutdowns would price these miners back in. The problem is that even without explosive difficulty growth, the machines that would get shut down in these scenarios are necessarily the least meaningful class of machines with respect to proportion of total network hashrate, simply because of pervasive advancements in process node efficiency. So I think if we want to find the most likely driving force here, it's going to be a reluctance for miners to lay down funds for new capital expenditures.

I think this observation is very plausible. While the Bitlicense is far from ideal (I'm being charitable there to a level that approaches outright comedy), there is so much interest and creative energy to create services that is languishing in the US due to chilling effects. It's just impossible to know whether or not you will be singled out for absolutely capricious investigation and prosecution, and even if the government doesn't explicitly go after you, good luck trying to function as anything more than a second-class citizen in constant fear that banking for your completely above-board legitimate business will get terminated on vague, non-negotiable "risk" grounds.
On the other side of the coin, this is some pretty standard regulatory capture. Freeze out the upstarts in an emerging market/product until the big guys figure out how they're going to cash in. For example, the FDA couldn't have been bothered for years to even consider allowing stevia to be classified as a food additive, yet somehow the moment Cargill wanted to market it under the brand name Truvia, it was a completely different story. Perhaps the Bitlicense is a prelude to the Bitcoin Truvias.

He hand waves his way through a highly contentious theory about natural monopoly by somehow implying that economy of scale causes natural monopoly, which has absolutely zero to do with the underlying economics of what natural monopoly even means in the first place, then changes the subject to mining pools to create the innuendo that centralization in pools is the same thing as a monopoly producer.

Paper wallets work because the key space is so inconceivably ginormous that you can just generate a valid random number completely offline to make a private key. Also it's worth noting that addresses and keys are a higher-level abstraction that does not actually exist at all in the blockchain, at least with respect to spending an output. What allows you to perform a spend is satisfying a script, and when you send to the public address you generated as a paper wallet, you happen to have the key to generate the signature which satisfies the script.

In another sense, this kind of statement is to be expected, because the self-interest of the ATM industry itself would indicate no reason to lose the ability to operate and seek new profits in an emerging ATM-type market just out of some kind of emotional loyalty to players in the financial services industry that doesn't necessarily directly profit them in any way.

They re-installed the Shah, a brutal reactionary tyrant, which lead directly to Khomeni's theocratic revolution.

These shares have a "difficulty" associated with them, and pools set minimum share difficulty to prevent faster miners from having to spam to submit shares, i.e. submitting one share of a certain difficulty, the pool knows statistically how many hashes you would have done and rewards you accordingly proportional to the hashes collectively done by all the other pool participants. If you find a share that has difficulty greater than bitcoin difficulty, you have actually successfully created a block for the pool. You can work out statistically how often this is expected to happen based on the hashpower of the miner, but from what I understand in this case the miner wasn't merely unlucky, it is practically impossible to have the hashpower to earn shares equivalent to 200 BTC over the course of a couple months without producing even close to the amount of high difficulty shares you would expect. I don't know the exact figures but would imagine the probability of such a miner never creating a block solving share has got to be at least 1 in tens if not hundreds of millions.

I don't particularly take the idea of some co-opted corporate coin seriously, i.e. a "paypalcoin" or "googlecoin" or even "fedcoin". If a centralized entity wanted to issue value in this manner, all they would need to do is attach ecdsa or some such account-securing mechanism to something that is simply a proprietary database. This sort of scheme has existed for decades already. The entire economic value proposition of something like bitcoin is that the decentralization incentivizes actors to participate in creating that infrastructure that a Paypal or such firm would simply build on top of. There is no technological or economic advantage to simply reproducing this technology on a proprietary basis.

I would just stop trying to engage people in real life who aren't particularly interested and stick to communicating online and/or developing the skillset to accomplish what you would be interested in accomplishing in the space. In terms of interpersonal relationships, what I've personally observed is that if you're aloof about bringing it up, but people have a vague idea that you have something to do with it, people interested come to you, and in not coming across as evangelical, you project a more powerful image that Bitcoin is interesting enough that you don't have to convince people to be interested.

If this 14nm project is even remotely real, it was financed by failing to service their 28nm customers, many of whom ordered more than a year ago for February 2014 delivery and still nothing. Black Arrow is the most unethical company in the entire mining hardware space by far. 
Customer service is performed entirely by an "Alexey A." who refuses to disclose a last name (although it's known who he is) that typically only responds to certain customer inquiries to theaten denial of service if the customer tries to even talk to them. The company is registered to a "directior" named Alexandru Ion Sovu who is wanted for wire fraud in his native Romania since 2003, and fled to the UK to avoid prosecution. It's held by a holding company registered in the British Virgin Islands, obviously intended for embezzlement of funds. The "Alex Berk" mentioned in the article is a criminal alias of Alex Sovu. Black Arrow itself is registered in Hong Kong, but if you order from them, wire transfers are done to a bank account of a Daniel Adronic also in the UK (because obviously this entire thing is a front to steal and embezzle customer money). 
This is not a real company, basically all they do is take customer funds, crudely outsource everything at great expense to outside parties in Shenzhen, and then blame and threaten the customers when inevitably failing to perform. All 28nm customers who are still waiting after more than a year since ordering are told that the company can't refund because it's essentially bankrupt, yet 14nm and scrypt ASICs are somehow happening (by soliciting $500,000 investments over their website online shopping cart (!), which has to be paid upfront before the "investor" gets to even see the contract, after which if deemed unacceptable, Black Arrow keeps 10% or $50,000!). 
In an even weirder turn of events, Black Arrow recently went on Bitcointalk to produce a thread proposing a "Bitcoin protocol change" that was absolutely farcical, claiming that they had been hacked and bitcoins were stolen. The reason this is an issue? They never cashed out any Bitcoin payments from 28nm customers (despite taking the orders on the pretense that immediate cashouts on BTC-e would happen, not so coincidentally the most favorable exchange for them rate-wise, and customers were even charged exchange fees). Like every other scammer in history sitting on a bunch of customer bitcoins, they cried "hack" and embezzled 100% of the money.

There is a lot of technical confusion and inaccuracy across this entire presentation. Orphan rate has nothing to do with anything Ghash.io could be doing on purely the mining end, because orphan races are based merely on block size and speed of network propagation. If your pool's full nodes are better hooked up to the network at large and on low latency connections, then you simply experience a lower orphan rate. Secondly, "luck" is not quite the idea that this post would lead us to believe. Comparing "luck" across mining pools requires you to actually know the hashrate internal to the pool. Unless the pool is extremely accurately self-reporting it, you simply don't know, and the only other way to even begin to know otherwise is to derive hashrate from the proportion of blocks solved, which confounds the "luck" variable you were trying to measure to begin with. Finally, the hypothesis about modified coinbase tx is absurd on a level that can't even be fathomed to begin with, because if that were the case, everyone would automatically be solo mining yet earning pool shares simultaneously with the same hash rate right this moment.

Nothing has intrinsic value (except happiness). Aristotelian teleology 101.
Intrinsic value is a very specific technical term used in finance to describe the valuation of equity due to fundamentals. Ironically Bitcoin does have something analogous to this kind of intrinsic value, it's just that at this point it's unclear and highly contentious as to what methodologies would be correct in determining that value.  It has absolutely nothing to do with the made-up sophomoric philosophical sense that people tend to misuse in this context.

That's so absurd it's difficult to figure out even where to start.
Maybe a good place to begin is introducing the notion that money is a good that has utility as a medium of exchange, insofar as solving the double coincidence of wants problem. 
It's impossible for a money not to have "value". A specific form of money may have certain pros and/or cons versus other forms of money, insofar as satisfying the three functions of money (medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account), but that's a completely different analysis.
For Bitcoin specifically, the notion that the technology somehow has value, but the unit of currency does not, completely misses the boat as to what Bitcoin even accomplishes in the first place. Conceptually divorcing the utility of the network from the value of the asset it moves leaves us with a network capable of transacting value, yet with no value in transacting that value? There is no such network in existence that operates like that. Even XRP has some kind of value, otherwise Ripple wouldn't work, even though the use case of Ripple involves moving assets centrally-issued by some counterparty. These kinds of open networks would never exist in the first place unless the native, counterparty-free token had some kind of "intrinsic" value, if only merely in the functioning of the network itself.

Differences of degree are not differences of kind.
Fiat money fails the store of value test because it's just currency and not money, because people have to resort to instruments that are not explicitly monetary to create de facto store of value effects, for example real estate and other investments. In a way, the demonetization of gold didn't demonetize gold, it demonetized currency except as medium of exchange.
Bitcoin has the properties to be a store of value that fiat simply does not, but the drawback is nascent adoption and thinly-traded price discovery, which are emergent empirical characteristics of newness.

It only doesn't make sense if you assume that there are no barriers to entry such as fixed costs in starting any operation. In order for an ASIC manufacturer to run a farm instead of selling the machines, they have to lay out some fixed cost in sourcing the facility, technical infrastructure surrounding power and cooling, data, etc. Then there is the variable costs of maintaining operations. This entire enterprise has a lot different risk/reward than simply manufacturing a unit and selling it for profit to customers. 
A result of this view however is that companies that manufacture equipment that also offer cloud hashing contracts are almost obviously going to be scams or at least engage in some kinds of unethical and deceptive practices, because having actually created the operation to host these machines, the temptation to delay your service to mine themselves is too great.

Decentralization doesn't necessarily mean specifically that an imaginary line toward centralization is suddenly crossed the moment something becomes expertise or resource prohibitive for just some random dude. I think a much better standard for whether something is decentralized is whether or not access to the system is controlled by a centralized gatekeeper. I'm starting to think that the centralized/decentralized nomenclature that we use carries with it too much imprecision and outright meaningless connotations, and maybe we should refer to such systems as open versus proprietary.

You don't "make a choice", economics is filled with examples of equilibrium that result from competing contradictory effects, for example the classic textbook example of the income vs substitution effect. If economic systems were not composed of such negative feedback mechanisms that no economic situation anywhere would ever be stable.
Furthermore, transactions do not "increase the utility and the actual value of bitcoin", frankly that's completely absurd. For one, valuation decreases as velocity increases ceteris parabis, per the income velocity of money formula. We need to be precise about these matters, in reality an uptick in transaction volumes does not cause utility, but is a symptom of utility compared to some other baseline level. Or not. If an increase in velocity coincides with an increase in valuation, then to attribute that valuation to the velocity is a cargo-cult conclusion, because it obscures the underlying causation of what is at best two correlates. This is too complicated an empirical situation to boil down to weird baseless generalizations. In cases like this you simply cannot know what effects win out from arguments made on a strictly a priori basis.

He's right, in many cases you could just take upfront payment, convert to bitcoin if necessary, simulate what the mining revenues would be, and just slowly trickle that amount of bitcoin back to the customers. In many cases where difficulty is rising quickly over sustained periods, this wouldn't even be a Ponzi because the payouts in BTC to the customers until the end of time would be lower than the initial investment.

It does make sense, there are two fatal omissions from your analysis:
1) Time preference / risk asymmetry: customers pays up front to receive revenue over the course of the rental. Company can structure this to cover fixed and variable costs at scale plus an acceptable profit margin, and the customer sits on all the risk (Bitcoin value and difficulty).
2) information uncertainty: there is absolutely no such thing as a "money printing machine" that makes any kind of determinate "X per hour" over any meaningful mining contract period.
Granted yes, GAW is a raging scam and it's very easy for rental mining in general to be conducted as a scam, but to completrly discount the rationale for a legitimate operation is kind of a fairytale oversimplification.

I appreciate the sentiment behind this sort of idea, but this isn't exactly a situation where you can just flip the numerator and denominator and cleverly land on some deep ironic insight. This empirical claim is not true unless Bitcoin becomes widely recognized as a unit of account in its own right, which simply isn't remotely the case at the moment. Price movements due to speculation do not tell us anything definitive about the aggregate sentiment of the market with respect to the dollar, for example if I buy some amount of Bitcoin for speculative purposes, that does not necessarily reveal anything about my overall sentiment concerning the dollar, other than my feeling that those bitcoins will be worth more dollars because I see their utility growing. This kind of behavior is no more inherently  a vote of confidence (or lack thereof) in the dollar then buying anything else. When food prices go up, that doesn't indicate a drop in confidence in the dollar and in favor of corn.

That's total crap, because banks are not in a position to actually implement anything remotely like what Bitcoin does in payments alone. This Chase service for example is exactly the same thing as writing a check for a friend who also uses Chase, so there is instant settlement because it's all in-house within Chase. The "technological innovation" here is keeping people within Chase's ledger, which merely means that this kind of "innovation" can only scale as monopoly.

A hard fork means that the new client produces/validates blocks that the old version would consider invalid. A soft fork means that the new client has features or interprets transactions in some new way that the previous client doesn't understand, but blocks containing such transactions are still valid to the old client.
This gets confusing because "fork" is also used in the context of codebases. For example you could "fork" the Bitcoin code to create your own implementation, but if say you followed all the same protocol rules as the reference client, you would not have forked anything to do with the blockchain.

At the same time, he's more than welcome to put more and more money into consumer infrastructure as far as I'm concerned. I'm more than happy to benefit financially with respect to my personal holdings as a result of this self-important stooge throwing money at this.

This is to be expected with anything new and highly speculative, it's just a matter of arithmetic that a small number of people are going to get involved early in something that very few people believe is worthwhile at first. The silver lining is that the only way that early adopters can enjoy any gains from what they've done is to spend bitcoins, so to a large extent that situation is self-correcting naturally by profit-taking.


There's way too much here being conflated. In some ways, yes, there are centralization risks, but at the end of the day nobody you're describing is immune to usurpation whatsoever, and there is so much talent now entering the space that we are sure to see upheavals in the not-so-distant future.

Holding equity in Paypal entitles you to a certain percentage of their profits via dividends. 
Holding bitcoins does not entitle you to a percentage of the profits of miners. Bitcoins are not shares of equity. It may have a vague similarity to equity in the sense that a growing ecosystem should roughly correlate to appreciation of bitcoin as an asset, but the mechanism for that appreciation is not analogous to corporate profits, it's increased utility value, which is a fundamental that should influence price discovery.

Basically what's going on here is somebody on bitcointalk produced some analysis, and subverted it, turned it into completely unsubstantiated get-rich-quick nonsense to the chagrin of the actual poster doing the analysis on bitcointalk, and then invented a creepy term ("Pegafractal Cryptovivik Livernalysis"?) that gives everybody douche chills complete with weird unnecessary banner logo in order to co-opt the whole thing as his own.
It's really quite stunning the degree to which this reasonable 1-page thread was turned into something completely off-the-rails:

Bankers are not all rent-seeking sociopaths. A lot of them get very excited about new technologies and the possibility of advancing in their careers by understanding and executing on it. I personally know several "bankers" that are between middle management and director-level for a few different kinds of banks, and 100% of them think I'm cool as hell for being involved in this. I didn't even mention it to any of them (initially assuming it wasn't a positive conversation to have with them), but they all found out from a friend-of-a-friend type chit-chat and approached me socially about it. 
The very first time this happened, it was a fairly attractive woman a little younger than me that I didn't know too well, and she approached me at a party thrown by mutual friends. The moment she brought it up I was dreading having the conversation, but right out the gate her reaction was "that's brilliant, that is so the future of money" and all she wanted to do for the remainder of the party was talk to me and ask me questions about it. 
I would not jump to conclusions about "bankers", a lot of very cool and inquisitive people happen to work for banks, and you might be surprised if you actually talk to them.

This "solution" is completely bogus. It's true that in their proposed scheme, driving up difficulty Y forces pools to restructure in such a way that individual miners control the private keys to the coinbase transaction. But in that case pool mining ceases to exist and everybody is now a solo miner. This is the holy grail of centralization risk, because now the only entities that can even dream of profitably mining have to control gigantic operations to even hope to find a block ever. They admit this in the paper too which is mind-boggling.

That's just propaganda. Ripple can't actually work without XRP having non-trivial monetary value, because lacking PoW, tx fees need to reflect an opportunity cost. Furthermore there is no way to use Ripple in a way free of counterparty risk without strictly using XRP (and the consensus algorithm vulnerabilities even take that away!).
Secondary, Ripple has baked-in whatever-they-want, simply owing to the fact that the founders control so much XRP that they can paint the economics to look however they want. Not to mention that they are rewarding themselves financially by arbitrarily holding an insane amount of XRP, exactly like every other scammy premine ever.

This question in and of itself represents a fallacy, because in order for a money to be deflationary, the supply of transactable goods and services has to be increasing. That automatically means that capital is being invested to produce that growth in the first place. This entire misconception arises from all the fact that two completely distinct causes create systematic price declines, it's either less money chasing more goods, or demand collapsing reducing supply and demand schedule equilibrium. This question takes the first scenario and then attributes properties of the second scenario to it.

If you were one of the early adopters of chopping firewood, right when humanity first discovered that it was useful for burning to sustain fires, and you stockpiled a bunch of it before the majority of people valued it for its use in fire-making, are you running a scam convincing other people of its use and selling it at massive gain (compared to the value of your chopping labor and productive capital) once firewood adoption increased?

I think there's some equivocation on terms here that confuses the situation. When we're talking about trustless micropayment channels, I think the term "third party" in that context really means something more like "outside of Bitcoin", rather than the specific financial terminology of a third party being counterparty to a transaction. Technically I guess you could say an off-blockchain payment rail actually is a third-party in that sense, although in a trusttless or federated scenario it would be more like a DAO is the third party, rather than the traditional idea of a central clearinghouse providing settlement.

A hard fork happens when a new version of the full node client accepts blocks as valid that previous versions would have rejected as invalid. The moment such a block gets submitted to the live network, the new clients will accept it and build on that chain, whereas the old clients will reject it and start building on a different block at that height, at which point the two networks are operating on different longest chains (hence fork).

The 1 MB blocksize cap is not the scalability issue, that's simply a hacky arbitrary cap put in place temporarily as an obsolete anti-spam measure. 
The scalability issues have to do with the system propagating and validating larger numbers of transactions and bigger blocks without hitting bandwidth and processing levels that would make running nodes prohibitive except for a small number of elite economic actors.
The decision to increase blocksize cap has nothing to do with scalability (other than the uninteresting fact that maintaining the 1 MB cap indefinitely artificially prevents scalability from ever becoming an issue anyway), it's just removing an artificial quota in anticipation of increased usage above that cap.

The biggest issue with blockchain.info and any such services is not technical whatsoever, it's that these companies literally depend on spying on you as a future monetization strategy. Not only does your wallet always connect to a centralized API to perform any network functions, merely looking up your own addresses on the web permanently records the fact that your IP address was interested in that address. The problem here has nothing to do with whether we might think blockchain are good people or not, it's that at this point when there are other reasonable options, we can't take risks like that.

The underlying ideas in this analysis remind me of "bubblewatch" in @_date: 2015-05-10 17:51:46
That at least requires a sybil attack on the network to pull off with reliability, as opposed to coincidentally leaking some data inconsistently, and there are techniques (albeit not quite yet perfect) such as bloom filters to at least try to improve privacy. Whereas if you're using a wallet to connect to a centralized API/indexing server, you're simply handing over everything under the trust that the organization involved is true to their word. 
That's a hard amount of trust to swallow, especially as Bitcoin usage becomes more ubiquitous and the temptation to benefit from abusing that data becomes more and more apparent. Even if the centralized company administering these servers never decides to anything unethical, that's potentially an amazing attack surface for malicious hacking.

This suggestion wins the thread. For personal cold storage, you don't need P2SH because the n-of-m aspect doesn't have to actually happen inside of Bitcoin. P2SH is valuable because it allows independent parties to perform n-of-m without actually revealing the secret to the other parties.
Heck you could even create a super-ghetto 2-of-3 by striping the hex form of the private key into two 128-bit numbers, and performing a bitwise XOR to create a third 128-bit number. Any two of those 128-bit numbers XOR'ed to each other gives the third.

Shamir secret sharing is used completely outside the protocol as a way to split the key material itself.

The IRS guidance indicates that bitcoins are taxed as income based on the market price the day they are mined, and this establishes the cost basis.

The way this kind of bureaucratic / regulatory-type law works in the United States is that there are laws on the books actually passed by legislatures, and there are executive branch bureaucratic enforcement / regulatory agencies, and when something new or not completely understood pops up, you're required to be in compliance with the agency's interpretation of the law prior to the agency actually even telling anybody what that interpretation is (for example, there are some nuances to the IRS's guidance that nobody necessarily would've anticipated, yet you're liable after-the-fact for any penalties). 
Technically these positions can be challenged in the courts, but with the modern regime of points systems and mandatory minimums, the prosecutors basically come at you with charges that have insane sentences, and you are scared into plea'ing down instead of having the opportunity to challenge the executive branch, lest you get a multi-decade sentence for some minor nonviolent offense. The de facto result is that executive branch agencies get to write the law with no reasonable judicial means to challenge without taking great personal risk, and the only check and balance on the situation is being a financial benefactor of the campaigns of politicians who can lean on these bureaucrats to produce your desired result.

This is a fairly routine technique however that con artists and scammers use to intimidate customers without much legal saavy or resources to go away without pursuing any kind of civil action.
A recent example is mining company Black Arrow had an employee supposedly domiciled in Shenzhen who handled all the email correspondence with irate customers. During that time period in which they were delayed tremendously in filling customer orders (and when they could, a huge percentage were defective and required RMA, literally catching on fire and flooding customer homes with toxic burning plastic fumes), a number of agreements were eventually made with customers over email, and that particular employee even made very bizarre legal threats against customers that continued asserting their rights. Eventually Black Arrow claimed that the employee in question was fired for sending a million-plus dollars worth of equipment without getting paid to another scammer (Matt Carson of now defunct exit-scam Minersource, who is still scott free and with Oregon Mines), and all those outstanding customer arrangements were swept under the rug after throwing a supposed rogue employee under the bus.

What happens to the DPR coins is going to be critical to the future of Bitcoin, because the majority of his holdings have absolutely nothing to do with the Silk Road whatsoever, he got really lucky getting buy orders filled during a Mtgox flash crash. The fact that they can arbitrarily seize all your bitcoin just because of suspicion is troubling, and if they auction off the entire amount due to a guilty verdict that's even more troubling. This would basically set the precedent that doing anything illegal whatsoever results in arbitrary forfeiture of all your money. If Bitcoin takes off as a store of value in the future on a scale much larger than now, you could see people targeted for very minor crimes just to confiscate and liquidate all their holdings.

Stocks are income-generating assets through dividends. Even zero dividend stocks expecting rapid growth are not immune from that reality because the valuation takes into account the expected future dividends being high.
Bitcoin is a commodity that does not generate income but has utility value in its use.
Total penetration of all use cases on the face of the earth most optimistically puts bitcoin realistically in the single-digit millions, that's the potential upside that speculation prematurely anticipates. There is no basis for any valuation higher than that, the idea of a valuation in the hundreds of millions of dollars has no justification (outside of little cute sematic games like coupling that prediction with rampant devaluation of the dollar for instance).

This is more a b2b advantage, because the friction of setting up lines of credit leaves alot of low-hanging fruit, especially in service industries such as logistics where taking on ad hoc business with quick turnaround can be extremely profitable, but difficult to pull off because of the inability to settle these kinds of transactions quickly. 
For example, if you run a third-party warehouse near a port facility, you want to be in a position to be able to take emergency work from customers with whom you had no prior relationship. There are a ton of use-cases I can think of, like for example ocean containers are not considered road-worthy past a certain number of miles from a port, so if you are importing merchandise that you intend on storing considerably inland, you need a facility near the port to either transload to a regular trailer for delivery to your location, or perform the sort and seg and PO fulfillment at that third party location. It isn't unheard of for companies to need to send overflow work to other logistics operations than their primary providers due to unexpected delays backing up workload volume out of scope of their primary contracted volume, or rapid ramp-ups to take advantage of new sales opportunities. There are sometimes cases where freight has no place to go, and it's advantageous to contract another warehouse immediately as a one-off, to prevent just keeping freight in a trailer or container and getting raped with charges for not returning the trailer or container, and even that is only possible if you already have a drop arrangement with the drayage carrier and they aren't exclusively operating with live loads. In cases like these it would be amazing to instantly settle for services in cash without the overhead of setting up credit arrangements, for all parties involved.
In a retail context, the fulfillment speed isn't necessarily where this advantage is felt, because outside of maybe say international situations, a retailer will ship once the credit card goes through anyway. The difference here is shown in the deadweight of fraud/chargebacks, because it's impossible to wait long enough to ship for a credit card to be irreversible.

I'm not necessarily as pessimistic as this might indicate, but I think it's entirely possible we're seeing a terminal failure mode playing out right now. If we can't reach some kind of compromise about slightly increasing a completely arbitrary temporary anti-DoS measure put in by Satoshi without projecting all our slippery-slope abstractions about long-term scalability onto the conversation, then there's a non-zero chance that we will never actually make the straightforward changes we need to make.
If that ends up being the case, and the perma-1MB bitcoin reaches usage demand that overlay technologies are not ready to accomidate, then that may send a strong message to any future system architects that the solution needs to be publicly launched in what essentially constitutes a final form, and that the eventual successful system will be an iteration of births and deaths of previous systems. 
This is all well and good in principle, but if that becomes the evolutionary trajectory of these kinds of systems, we may never actually end up with an open system like this ever, because nobody outside of an infinitesimally-small population of enthusiast tinkerers will ever bother touching successive iterations of Bitcoin, because there can be no real economic use-cases if the systemic risk of obsolescence and usurpation from square one always lies on the horizon.
So to TL;DR to this pessimistic speculation: maybe it's entirely possible that if solving this situation proves impossible, then we may never actually have the social conditions to support grassroots adoption of any similar open system ever.

I think the reason might at least to some degree be that the function of Bitcoin in a portfolio is a small percentage high risk / high reward Hail Mary play, so your typical saavy investor is looking at the possibility of return in the thousands of percent (or zero) instead of nickel-and-diming active trading fib levels in the current trend channels on bucketshops. If those assumptions are true, then buying in at these prices is not a big deal, and when they realize their gains it's just selling through their brokers, instead of dealing with some legally-ambiguous exchanges and having weird looking red flag tax returns.

Selfish mining has to be combined with a Sybil attack to have any efficacy, in order to win orphan races. The idea is you as the selfish miner hold the solved block and wait until you detect someone else's block at that height, then you submit yours and beat them through superior connectivity to the p2p network. This sets you up to spend the time between your block solve and the competiting miner's solve at 100% hashing power on top of your block that no one else has seen.

There is no dichotomy.

If we're talking poetically here, where we're just figuratively talking about the "policy" something has concerning things that are "monetary", then sure, that's fine, but actually taking that usage literally is a massive equivocation.

I recommend avoiding calling people naive and ignorant when you fail to understand what they're actually saying. In the current climate, the chilling effect on actually opening an exchange is so ridiculous that it drives out almost every potential above-board exchange operator. You can be doing everything right as far as you can tell, then out of nowhere the US government can just decide you're a money launderer and ruin your life even if you're not in the US. Then they'll dance around high-fiving and back-slapping each other while pissing on your corpse, politically-grandstanding like they did anything at all to actually protect the American people.

So basically this de-facto faction in the space got what it asked for in this guy, he took all of your specious critiques, jammed them into a vague bullshit whitepaper, and got you to do all the work for him by conditioning people to think these were make-or-break issues for Bitcoin without cultivating any reading of subject matter experts.

Regulators are always going to be able to grandstand disingenuously on this one because of how this works in the US. There is no exchange-specific regulation in existence anywhere, even the Bitlicense doesn't address these issues. The Bitlicense is mainly concerned with custodianship of funds and serves as a tech-specific MSB license (if anything Coinbase is in the process of submitting to even more regulation than necessary).
FinCEN got the ball rolling originally by deciding that "virtual currency exchangers" qualify as money-service businesses under Federal statute, therefore in order to be in compliance with Federal law, a US exchanger has to satisfy MSB requirements in every state in which they operate. Some states either have no MSB licensing or have explicitly decided that Bitcoin companies do not fall under the purview of MSB licensing. 
Exchange-specific regs, such as addressing practices such as frontrunning do not exist anywhere whatsoever in this industry, so it's always going to be possible for some regulator to soapbox in this manner, as for the time being there is always something that can be deemed "unregulated" per the perverse view that being "regulated" entails compliance with every possible thing a regulator might spring on anybody in the future.

Not a single "space power" has actually "banned" Bitcoin whatsoever. 
China has explicitly stated that it's totally legal, but PBOC instructed banks not to do business with online exchanges nor hold Bitcoin as an asset on their balance sheets.
Russia has produced alot of rhetoric about a ban, but at present all that actually exists is a flimsy judicial ruling that censors access to websites that is trivial to workaround. There is talk of potential legislative or bureaucratic ban in the works, but there is pushback within the relevant ministry and the Russian Bitcoin userbase.
The United States has been the least openly hostile but suppresses Bitcoin through the paralysis of ongoing regulatory uncertainty. 
The "space powers" are way more subtle than just banning. The only nations in existence with confirmed bona fide bans are entirely highly unstable third world countries that might be under immediate threat of disintermediating the authority of their autocratic regimes.

Bitpay is basically a byproduct of the US regulatory environment, because there is nothing that inherently requires the software-as-a-service payment processing software platforms to also double as a cashout service. I think the only reason these services are packaged together is the heretofore lack of ways for a business to actually cash out bitcoins taken as payment for goods and services without jeopardizing their banking arrangements.
In a future where we have a robust infrastructure for accommodating bitcoin commerce, there is zero reason for any party other than the vendor to have their transaction records. The party that exchanges a business's bitcoins in no way needs to have anything whatsoever to do with the software that's running a merchant's bitcoin payments.

First off, I would be astonished if the term "market cap" even so much as appeared in any introductory economics textbook.
More importantly, going back to the context of this conversation, it's *profoundly* moronic to assume that an author doesn't know about supply and demand just because he comes to a conclusion that seems counter-intuitive from the perspective of having essentially zero familiarity with the underlying concepts. If all I'm familiar with is the English language and orthography, and I see someone reading Japanese aloud, I don't immediately conclude, "this idiot doesn't even know English 101, what the hell is he doing making sounds looking at gibberish?".
The dynamics of price discovery in a free-floating small-cap asset is simply not a topic in any introductory economics course, sorry! There are plenty of ways for speculators to get involved that don't necessarily simply translate into demand. But "herp derp supply and demand" is not an answer for anyone serious.

This is a real concern, because p2pool very quickly reaches scaling issues that make it start to act less like a pool and more like something in between pool and solo mining. 
A great possible application of p2pool might not be individual miners going on it directly, but a compromise where p2pool becomes a lower level infrastructure for centralized pools to mine on top of. P2pool would act like a great variance-reduction layer that removes a significant incentive for large pools, while the pools themselves still handle the payouts to individual miners, solving the sharechain / split Coinbase scalability limitations.

I think you are extremely misguided about the use case of metalayer protocols here. Assets issued in this way requires a trusted central issuer, which is perfectly sensible for things such as issuing equity, but for straight up remittance flows, that's another barrier to the whole thing that requires a new artificial Western Union in its place. If that's the case, we might as well use shitty centrally-controlled Ripple. The strength of Bitcoin itself in this appication is that the currency itself is completely counterparty-free and potentially has universally-recognizable value completely independent of any issuing authority, which paves the way for a totally heterogeneous mix of unconnected service providers everywhere operating through Bitcoin as a neutral medium of exchange. You do not achieve this result trading colored coins issued against some centrally-controlled asset, that's eGold again.

This quote is factually correct but suggests an interpretation that is completely disingenuous. What Bitcoin does is make point A and B completely unrelated entities capable of interoperability on an open system. The reason that doesn't help Wstern Union isn't that Bitcoin has no benefit here, it's that Bitcoin removes the need for Western Union entirely, because now anyone can compete to do the "last mile". The only reason Western Union exists to even handle the "last mile" is because of a proprietary monopoly on A to B. Moreover this quote betrays the delusional arrogance typical to a company on the brink of complete disintermediation, that it's rightly any concern of anyone outside of Western Union that they even have a way to take advantage of Bitcoin in the first place.

To be honest I don't find that surprising. The game is horrifically boring and the way that Bitcoin is integrated is counterintuitive and confusing, i.e. the in-game "BTC" is not bitcoin, it's just that buying in-game "BTC" funds the address from which you receive tips from playing the game.

This is the problem with that statement, because they're unequivocally lying.
"Backing" literally means that a note is redeemable for money, going back to the days where gold literally was money and the note was an IOU on claiming that money. There is nothing else "backing" actually means. What they're doing is describing something that has properties similar to backing, but by calling it "backing" they're resorting to strictly speaking in some kind of poetic sense.
What they're describing is called **open market operations**. That's not backing. What that means is that the Fed manipulates money supply by putting dollars into circulation by buying assets from the Treasury or banks, and takes dollars out of circulation by selling assets.

The salesman was actually kind of right, but not for the reason supposedly offered. Even deep into the late-90s a substantial number of ISPs did not support 56k, much less at every local access number. Or even if your local number did, depending on usage, you might not necessarily be guaranteed to have 56k hardware on the other end available to connect to, so you might often connect at 28.8 or 33.6 anyway. Not only that, for most of that time period, there were two competing standards that were incompatible at the ISP level (X2 vs Flex). Furthermore your ability to actually achieve 56k was heavily dependent on the specifics of your phone wiring and quality of local telephone service. The idea of possibly forsaking 56k for 33.6 at upwards of half the price was not stupid at all in a lot of cases. To make matters even more complicated, if the modem in your anecdote was a US Robotics winmodem, it's extremely likely it was firmware upgradable to 56k anyway.

Shorting is basically borrowing bitcoins on margin to sell right now with the expectation of buying them back cheaper later, and you pocket the difference.

This doesn't quite work how you're describing in reality, the p2pool donation setup doesn't work by sending to an address, it works by querying a p2pool server for the individual addresses and using bitcoind to produce a sendmany using that queried data.
It could still work, but it would require a lot of sophistication from the wallet software. It would need to connect to "trusted" p2pool servers (which would make it a nice pinata to attack w/ man-in-the-middle), and all the transactions that you create using this method would be monstrous in size, comparable to p2pool's own coinbase tx.
On the otherside of the coin, there is some benefit to that situation, in the sense that it's much more likely that no other pool would even bother mining these huge zero fee tx's. A possible side-effect though is if such a system became suitably commonplace, it might systematically interfere with attempts to develop proper tx fee tools such as currently happening in Bitcoin Core development.

I'm with Satoshi on this issue 100%. There's a lot of commentary going around in the crypto space about "monetary policy" and over-extending the concept to cryptocurrency issuance parameters, but the reality is way more complicated than just calling the halvings towards 21 million supply a monetary policy. 
Bitcoin is a commodity money exactly like other commodity monies in history, and it's entirely disingenuous to argue that some kind of flexible "monetary policy" is necessary to ensure stability, when in reality that's not what monetary policy is whatsoever. 
The historical and economic truth is that monetary policy is not the concept that pops in your head just combining the words "monetary" and "policy". It's a very specific modern regime of central banking whose explicit purpose is manipulating macroeconomic factors via having central power over the money supply. A naive lay justification would be to produce value stability, but that isn't the explicit goal at all, nor has monetary policy ever actually produced stability.

That's absolutely untrue and dangerous advice you're handing out.

You can find information by googling NYDFS and reaching their official site.

If NYDFS stays at least true to their word that this is only to regulate financial intermediaries, the Bitlicense wouldn't directly stop any free peer-to-peer uses of the technology, although there are definitely "unintended" consequences that merit analysis.

Side chains are a total non-starter if you think it's a scaling solution that could provide any of the expected Bitcoin properties:
- They don't solve any of the alleged scalability problems because they have exactly the same scaling characteristics as the mainchain, and bandwidth/storage/CPU resources that go toward maintaining sidechains are simply resources displaced from the main chain
- The proper 2-way peg doesn't exist without softforking an opcode into Bitcoin, and because of it, sidechains have a different security model than actual Bitcoin
- There are potential centralization issues with a sidechain being merge-mined 
- The only sidechains that currently exist use a "Federated peg" where permissioned signatories hold multisig custody of funds on what is essentially a permissioned ledger

In truth, it doesn't appear that anyone yet has the slightest idea. We don't really know to what extent (if any at all) that your typical wallet is actually going to connect to the p2p network and enforce the smart contracting, we have no idea what the underlying infrastructure is really going to end up looking like as far as who runs hubs, how many, and how end users connect, and we have no idea what the UX is actually going to require (short of just general well-known mobile payments cliches).

The ability of Bitcoin to represent more aggregate economic activity (which blocksize is one proxy for, although admittedly not necessarily the only one) being a driver of valuation (at least in terms of fundamentals) is not something that is remotely controversial.
There some modern technical reasons why my terminology "aggregate value of real transactions" isn't really used anymore, but for the purposes of these ideas the original formulation of the equation of exchange is totally fine without over-complicating it with price indexes and nominal vs real valuation.

True, literally by definition of conflict of interest. It doesn't even necessarily have to involve nefarious intentions at all, that's irrelevant to whether there is a conflict of interest in the first place at all. Imagine that you have some corporate job in which you are the immediate supervisor of your spouse. No matter how much you intend to be nauseatingly fair about everything, there is no way you actually can be given the conflict of interest, despite all your noble intentions.

I don't get this impression at all from the conduct of the Core team in general. There is a stunning hostility toward basic research that is any less abstract than just applied mathematics, and instead of science, they seem to conduct themselves in accordance with a flimsy groupthink set of beliefs asserted a priori. The validity and soundness of those beliefs is held by the illusion of shouting down any challenge or questioning as a waste of time because these issues have been decided long ago by the very "experts" doing the shouting.

There is no reconciliaton possible here, it's better that a clean break is made sooner rather than later. The contributors who have gradually gained power and influence in steering the Core project have subverted the mission of the project with strange and frankly crackpot economic conceptions. They have every right to believe what they believe and contribute to software that implements their ideas, but the community, economic actors, and other developers also have every right to want nothing to do with their agenda.
In an ideal world, the concepts being spearheaded by the de facto leadership in Core would've become an altcoin, but unfortunately the lack of fundamental direction in the project has brought us to this place. They have every right to do what they're doing, but people opposed have every right to not consider their re-imagining "Bitcoin".

The appeal-to-authority nonsense is really getting old with respect to Adam Back. If you think about the situation plausibly, Satoshi basically asked him for citations to shoehorn into the whitepaper well after-the-fact of having the system pretty much all worked out. This is probably because the current batch of I'm-very-smart "wizards" are exactly the kinds of people who would've shouted Satoshi down into oblivion on the mailing list at that time, so asking for citations is a great move with respect to social intelligence: give lip-service to the work that they think is notable in order to ingratiate yourself.

It exactly was his software in conjunction with customer service procedures (although he wasn't the only vulnerable operation), because the malleability attack is a social engineering-style attack where the attacker convinces MtGox to restore a bitcoin balance that the attacker already received, by MtGox checking that the original tx never confirmed.

There is a long-standing legal precedent to protect the fungibility of cash against claims relating to bill serial numbers (i.e. the criminal is considered responsible, not the innocent people downstream of the criminal transaction). This hasn't been challenged and/or upheld legally yet with respect to cryptocurrencies, but there is probably a good chance Bitcoin would end up treated the same as cash in this regard.

On many issues China is actually way more reasonable and in line with the interests of its citizens than the US, for example they aren't really psychotic like the west is about AML/KYC stuff.

Peter Todd historically has been against sidechains on mainly two grounds: 1) the SPV proof security model to reverse the peg back to Bitcoin being susceptible to large re-orgs in the sidechain; and 2) merge-mining as some kind of vague centralization threat (the claim that only large miners are going to bother installing a merge-mined client such as Namecoin).
Interestingly, neither of these is concerns is necessarily relevant to the current status of sidechains, because the current testnet prototype is a Federated setup where testnet bitcoins are sent to an address, and blocks on the sidechain are produced by signatories (so neither 2-way peg nor merge-mining). There conceivably could never be a 2-way pegging mechanism unless new op codes are softforked in, but for obvious reasons relating to dev-capture we know that they're going to get those.

I think it's totally reprehensible to characterize proposing a change and offering it voluntarily to the community as reckless or abusive. I think the opposition (mainly Adam Back) is resorting to these tactics because the technical arguments against raising blocksize are super vague and weak, and the contention here really seems to be that raising blocksize is apparently ok as long as Greg Maxwell / Pieter Wuille / Wladimir do it, but otherwise no bueno. It could not be more obvious that a small cadre of devs are itching to push Gavin out of the project entirely, and have finally found their way by refusing to engage him in constructive dialogue on blocksize, and then characterizing his releasing of software that people are free to use or not use as a reckless power play.

1) Miners
2) The percentage is determined by the code
3) Be a miner that produces blocks of the appropriate version
4) No
This is not really "voting" in the sense that you're used to in everyday life, in the case of a soft-fork this is basically a way of rolling out the code for a change, and the voting is merely a way of ascertaining if it's safe to activate the change (i.e. a proponderance of blocks show evidence that miners are running the software that accepts the new rules).

I would argue even that is problematic in exactly the same way, just in the opposite direction, unless we're seeing evidence of intent or non-intent.
I think maybe some of the issue here is that it's easy to equivocate two different senses in which the word "design" is used.
When you say "Bitlicense is designed to...." you're saying something about the intention of the designer, and in fact you're not necessarily making any claim whatsoever of whether or not the design will result in those intentions teleologically.
When you say "The Bitlicense design leads to..." you're saying something about the consequences of what the design itself leads to, but you're not making any claim about the intentions of whoever put that design into place.
There are two kinds of "design":
- Design as synonym for intentions as a person.
- Design as synonym of the attributes of a system.
This article makes a case for the attributes of the system, but falsely attributes them to the intentions of a person.

Your conclusion does not follow from your premises. Again, I'm sympathetic to being against Bitlicense, but it doesn't logically follow. Nor is it remotely relevant to need to make this claim, when being against the Bitlicense as policy is enough, when there is no information that I'm seeing anywhere that sufficiently substantiates this notion as opposed to the more plausible alternatives that Lawsky is just exercising incorrect judgment and/or has a different opinion on the outcome.
It's fine to make guesses like this as a heuristic for decisions in the real world on an interpersonal basis, but this is supposedly a news article, and in this context these claims are unjustifiable slander without some very serious evidence that actually supports these claims.

The problem in my opinion isn't that any particular fee level is inherently problematic, it's that if we arrive at the situation where fees start to factor into the economic decisions of miners (which really isn't too far off if we stay at current capacity levels) before at least some plan for capacity increase mechanism is in place, then I would argue that miners potentially could be ossified way beyond current concerns about bandwidth and latency. If we make the capacity limits economically significant prior to at least getting the ball rolling on how this thing is going to grow, then we're asking miners to be exposed to risks with their capital well beyond anything they might be willing to accept.

The reason what Hearn is saying makes sense is because any open source project can be forked at any time, so there is nothing to be gained by creating paralysis in committing to one particular fork hell or high water. This "authoritarian" is not actually in charge of anything as far as imposing anything on anybody, because any changes have to adopted by consensus of the community of users and economic actors, but on the internets it's apparently fun to misconstrue that trigger word to pretend that some politicking committee of developers has a moral high ground, when in reality advocating this perverse kind of consensus is ironically just a way to reinforce the illusion of authority in that particular committee.

One consideration is that if scarcity develops in line with the publicly-stated agenda of devs like Pieter Wuille and Wladimir, then it's conceivable that we reach fairly consistent maximum utilization of blockspace (also assuming that demand to use the network isn't poisoned before then by operating at capacity consistently), and if demand for blockspace increases to a sufficient level that is not inconceivable even as a settlement layer, the post-halving cost per transaction would be less than 7-8 millibits for transaction fees to equal the subsidy. Unless we're talking about orders of magnitude price appreciation of bitcoin in the meantime, that price level is still relatively cheap and not far off for settlement-type use-cases. In a scenario such as described, suddenly you're talking about a situation where devs changing these parameters at all represents a tremendous counterparty risk to miners. It's not inconceivable that attempting to establish a fee market at this point where essentially nothing about scalability is known runs the risk of triggering a failure mode where increases beyond 1MB may no longer be possible ever without facing the spectre of network security chilling effects on the basis of dev risk.

This kind of secret-sharing wallet is not multisig, in the sense that p2sh is. With p2sh, each key that's needed signs and is included in the tx. With this method, a single private key is split, to be reconstructed prior to signng anything, and then would sign as a single key on the network. 
A real multisig paper wallet set would involve creating separate keys on paper then deriving the appropriate "3"-address for the signing policy. When time came to move th funds, all the appropriate keys would have to be swept into wallets which would then produce the needed signatures.

I'm not saying that Bitcoin is a point to point protocol whatsoever. It's just extremely well known that originally there was a feature where the payer specified an IP address, the client made a direct point-to-point connection to the recipient's node, which created the address behind the scenes, and the sender submitted the signed tx for the receiving client to push to the network. It's hilarious that you're ignorantly demanding a reference, as this function is known to everyone having used an early client and was eventually taken out (payment protocol is sort of a more well thought out second iteration of this scheme). 
Could you kindly point out where in the Bitcoin whitepaper the workflow of payer signing a tx to an address and submitting to the network is specified? Also could you point out where addresses are mentioned at all in the whitepaper? If what you're claiming is actually true then sections 2 and 5 should mention what you're claiming (hint: it's not true).

The capacity and fee levels are totally relevant, because if these details are not ironed out and consistent, then we run the risk that if fees abruptly spike, those pre-signed multisig settlement transactions may have to very realistically wait weeks or months to clear on the blockchain, and if we're talking about organic growth plus spikes in capacity demand, it's not inconceivable that they may never clear at all. If something like that became a problem, then all manner of band-aids solutions would have to arise that all undermine the trustlessness of a payment channel system.

This is a practice that has permeated from the top-down in the "technical community" surrounding Bitcoin, where theoretical assertions are substantiated "because game theory", with no awareness that game theory is a huge highly non-monolithic discipline of serious study. It reminds me how among this same class of actors, wikipedia-level comprehension of economics is used to substantiate highly contentious economic claims. Obviously this is a broad generalization, but from my personal academic experience, it's a fairly disproportionate trait among people in computer science to massively overestimate their knowledge of practically every field of study, because they are exposed to highly shallow niche aspects of such topics in various kinds of programming assignments, and possibly also exacerbated by the observation that it seems a disproportionate number of people attracted to CS as a field have some issues relating to inferiority complex.

The scenario your original question describes would be relevant to the original conception Satoshi had where people would ordinarily pay each other with a point-to-point message by direct IP connecting to the client, but in the current way that Bitcoin is used by interacting directly with addresses, transactions are propagated by the payer flooding the p2p mesh network, and the recipient can disconnect and reconnect to resync at any time.
Some aspects of point-to-point communication are coming back for example in two places: 1) the payment protocol, where authentication of the identity of the payee and metadata relating to the payment are transmitted point-to-point; and 2) payment channels, where signed raw transactions and exchanged back and forth between parties, and the final transactions are only broadcast to the network to settle the channel.

It's a very broad term that describes parties making Bitcoin transactions that are not directly settled on the blockchain. 
For example, if you use a Coinbase wallet to pay a merchant who uses Coinbase as a payment processor, there is no point actually sending a tx to the Bitcoin network, when Coinbase can just internally shift who owns what amount of bitcoins. This is reflective of the typical "exchange" model of off chain transactions, where you're dealing with two parties who both have accounts with the same intermediary entity.
Another kind of different upcoming example of transactions being off chain is payment channels, where signed transactions are exchanged point-to-point between parties, and only finally settled to the blockchain to close out the channel. This is less "off-chain" than an exchange in the sense that real Bitcoin transactions are being exchanged (that could be submitted to the network directly).
@_date: 2015-07-28 15:33:30
To be fair, I guess addresses versus just public keys wouldn't have had any impact on the UX whatsoever anyway. Satoshi envisioned in the original versions of Bitcoin that people would largely use a point-to-point IP-based payment, where the client negotiates a connection directly, and the receiver's client generates a new address behind-the-scenes, receives the raw tx, and broadcasts it to the network (instead of the payer). That workflow fell out of favor and was removed entirely, and the payment protocol is kind of a more well thought-out second iteration of that concept (which incidentally Amir Taaki was against, because Gavin).
I agree, it's a serious problem that Lightning Network is being abused for political purposes to justify suppressing increases to blocksize, when this whole thing needs time to develop and show how it would actually be used. Too much expectation is being placed on a system that nobody seems to actually understand at this point in time, and it's unfairly being co-opted as the focal point of a power struggle among devs.
The original point is very valid, somebody could read the Bitcoin whitepaper, and while they would likely come to different specific design choices (hash algorithms, which elliptic curve to use or if even ECDSA at all, the exact specification of the block data structure itself, the structure of a raw tx including what the scripting language would be like, etc.), the whitepaper is enough to explain what the system being described actually is. I see no such hope with this Lightning documentation.

I think he's right but he's not explaining it clearly. The issue with sending to an address multiple times is that you're not necessarily going to consume every output created sent to that address, which would guarantee the need to expose the public key more than once to claim all the outputs.
On the other hand, creating a lot of small outputs to different addresses is a field day for blockchain forensics, because you taint all kinds of addresses all willy-nilly. The best practice combining ECDSA security and privacy would be to always receive to different addresses, but if you're left with small outputs to periodically mix to create bigger outputs.

One thing I would be concerned about though is unless these people are really good at laundering money by presenting a small-business front, Coinbase is a really really really bad idea for depositing bitcoins to convert to fiat, as that info is all going directly to the IRS.

You're correct in the sense that Lightning does not exchange bearer assets whatsoever, the sufficiently-confirmed utxo is the bearer asset. Unconfirmed tx's are promissory instruments that are redeemed programmatically, and thus don't have the human risk inherent to traditional instruments, but do carry the risk of the underlying security model of redemption.

The mechanics of executing transactions themselves can be largely abstracted away through a software stack, however the larger concern is that functioning on a bi-directional payment channel network requires you to scan for and enforce the game theoretic integrity of the channel balance in real time, or contract a custodial or non-custodial (depending on how these functions get implemented with respect to the protocol) third-party to enforce the channels for you. This has business and risk modeling considerations way beyond the nuts and bolts of transaction interfaces.

I realized this early on, because I had a fairly intelligent friend who asked me about it, so we started talking about it, and I walked him step-by-step through a high-level overview of what Bitcoin is and roughly how it works.
I started noticing part way through that he started acting as though I was trying to convince him of something and started getting cunty trying to come up spurious imaginary skepticism about just mundane details about how it works.
At that point I realized, the correct attitude is meh whatever I know about it, yeah cool. It's on people to find stuff out, it's not your responsibility.

If you really believe this system has a future, why would you be in a rush to tell everybody about it so they can get in on it and ruin your potentially speculative long-term ROI.

Unless the wallet in question operates as a full node client, that's totally incorrect. Validating blocks is not an SPV function. These kinds of wallets perform no consensus function whatsoever, they merely check the validity of transactions of interest against the merkle root of the relevant block headers, which are served by full nodes (or some intermediary server like Electrum or Mycelium which itself indexes data served to it by a full node).

There isn't exactly one simple answer that accounts for what would happen to individual wallets, it might make most sense to divide wallets into categories. 
The full node reference client wallet will obviously work on the chain that the specific full node version you're running supports.
Indexed-server based SPV wallets will be dependent on what kind of node the server they're connecting to is based on. For example, if you're running your own Electrum server attached to a new node, you're on the new fork. Mycelium wallets will depend on what Mycelium themselves do, but in the future if the server is open-source then it would be exactly like Electrum.
SPV clients that connect directly to the network are dependent on the nodes that they're connecting to p2p, and likely there will be a lot of variation in behavior there based on how the specific p2p networking code in the wallet accepts or rejects nodes that serve conflicting tx and blockheader data.
Hosted wallets (Coinbase, Circle, all centralized exchanges) and wallets that depend on querying an API (Blockchain, AirBitz, etc.) will be on whatever node version those organizations are running to support their API.
This whole thing might be very academic though because I can't imagine a situation where any significant organization running an API or indexing servers would not upgrade to the new blocksize.

This is not what a Bitcoin fund is trying to do. A Bitcoin fund handles the delivery, redemption, and storage of the underlying on behalf of its holders.


Risk is not what stops IRAs and institutional funds from buying Bitcoin. Institutional funds are not even necessarily prevented from buying currently and many do. IRAs need a regulated retail instrument to handle (i.e. a qualifying fund).
None of the nuts and bolts of why a fund would exist have anything whatsoever to do inherently with the risk of the underlying, and literally your entire statement is made up simply to smear Bitcoin and the individuals / firms involved in creating and running funds by associating it with derivatives and the 2008 crisis for no relevant reason whatsoever.

Here's a metaphor to try to begin to understand what TA actually is, instead of this weird stuff here:
Imagine that you're playing tennis, and you're involved in a long protracted groundstroke rally. You've just hit a deep hard cross-court shot. The standard workflow for a groundstroke rally is that you need to splitstep and watch to react to the return by the time the ball makes contact with your opponent's racket. Conventional instruction says that you should position a few feet to the side of the centerline opposite the direction of your shot. 
The reason you do this is not because you're predicting anything about the shot that's going to be returned. It's that we know empirically as a general heuristic that a deep down-the-line shot is very low percentage, for a number of compounding reasons (i.e. the opponent is on the run, trying to hit an extremely technical shot with a lot of spin over the highest part of the net while still pinning you deep without going out). So the most likely thing your opponent is going to do is mirror your crosscourt shot back as a hard deep bomb (which you've prepared for by standing a touch closer to where the ball is going to be), or if your opponent goes down the line, they might commit an unforced error and you win the point anyway, or their shot will likely be weak and/or shallow if it stays in, in which case you didn't really lose anything standing a little bit away from the area where that shot would land.
Now just because this bit of instruction does not tell you with law-of-nature level rigor and precision exactly where the ball is going to be, doesn't mean that people just up and declare competitive tennis instruction "bullshit". The reality is that you need a certain amount of experience and exposure to the activity to actually understand the value in any given heuristic.

I would argue that sidechains in and of themselves have centralization risks relating to the peg that are unique in comparison to Bitcoin itself.
If it's like the current testnet setup with federated signatories, that's straight-up custodianship of funds to begin with.
If we're talking about the proper 2-way peg, in principle it appears completely decentralized, but in practice unless the size of the pegging transaction were dramatically reduced, or dramatically more blockspace were available, exercising the peg would undoubtedly work through a small number of professional market-makers.
These are very different centralization risks than exist in Bitcoin.

I think IoT has been pushed in the media narrative entirely the wrong way. I think in reality it's going to be a modest incremental automation of different things across different use-cases over decades, and it's not going to be one monolithic system or application stack, it will probably end up describing how different technology layers interact to produce automation, from cryptocurrency to decentralized marketplaces to AI.


It helps because having a permissionless system that anyone can use in order to supply the "last-mile" infrastructure unbundles the payment rails from the retail experience in such a way to maximize competition, and that function can even become sharing-economy/peer-to-peer. Technology allows for the verticals WU inhabits to be torn down into something more efficient.

This is a really interesting idea that merits discussion, despite the legion of uneducated feces-spewing trolls who suddenly fancy themselves professionals in payment processing.
The reason I think this is an interesting idea is because Bitcoin transactions have several cost-benefits from the merchant standpoint that do not necessarily have to be bundled together to incentivize the same party. For example, for many potential merchants, the speed of settlement might be enough to justify using even if payment processing were offered at VISA-level rates. That would mean that the payment processor themselves would be able to offer greater discounts / loyalty programs while potentially maintaining equal or greater profit margins.

This is inaccurate because the period length of exactly 210,000 blocks should be substituted for "6x25x365.25". Also the halving is not perfectly 1/2^x , it's the floor of that calculation in satoshis. The completion of 33 periods leads to exactly 20999999.97690000 at the start of the 34th period, in which the reward is finally 0. Also I think it's worth pointing out that the "why" here is not how the 21 million comes about, but why Satoshi wanted that target in the first place.

It's absolutely not safe to use shapeshift in a way that involves going to their website (as opposed to just resending to an address you setup before), because if the cert doesn't work or malware has been injected server-side, you have no idea if you're being man in the middled, which would allow an attacker in the case of shapeshift to transmit a bogus send to address and steal your funds.

for k = 700 billion, n = 2^160

It does absolutely nothing because Ripple IOUs are not fungible. A "last-mile" branch somewhere cannot get cash locally to payout to a customer withdrawing without having initiated some kind of conventional transfer from the issuing bank to a local arrangement, or swapping with someone locally. For this to actually do something for WU, their banking relationships would have to be re-constituted from the ground up such their partnered banks performed Ripple settlement between each other. 
The only way anything like this is remotely workable is that Ripple became so ubiquitous that there was enough local liquidity everywhere they service customers, such that they can produce conversion paths that are able to be settled locally in cash accessible to the retail location. This is exactly the same adoption barrier that Bitcoin faces, except that in the case of Bitcoin, there is no centralized monolithic entity that has to do everything vertically start-to-finish, so adoption can actually organically creep in on a niche basis.

This thought just occurred to me reading glancing over this thread, I've never seen an idea like this posited so I thought it would be worth considering:
What would be the consequences of allowing miners to mine at lower difficulties for proportionately lower coinbase tx subsidy? For example, allowing a block at half difficulty to be submitted to the network with a coinbase tx of 12.5 BTC. 
Obviously the code for determining the halving schedule would have to be something more complicated than simply checking block height, but are there possibly some advantages to heterogenously-timed blocks like that?

They have but it's not relevant whatsoever, because the failure mode happens in the real world where you have an established infrastructure of conventional computer based nodes doing the signature validations and mining, and an attacker would ostensibly emerge with a quantum computer prior to fully replacing the infrastructure with quantum computers capable of performing quantum algorithm-based primitives. In practice the solution is having primitives whose algorithms can be performed on conventional computers, but that are not trivially broken by quantum computers.

The problem with this perspective is that the empirical evaluation that you're categorically stating is completely made up. Even the idea that you can "feed the guidelines of TA to a bot" completely misunderstands what TA is in the first place, as though there's some official TA algorithm somewhere that's machine executable. This is a controversial area of inquiry with a lot of different research methodologies and hypotheses to test, and to summarily dismiss it in this completely uneducated way is laughable.
The whole thing isn't really about making predictions whatsoever in the first place. Here's a simple example, let's take the idea of trading on the basis of identifying a triple top.
Say you see a price rising on high volume but fails to break a certain level, and it retraces downward. Then later it picks up steam again retracing those gains 100% but on weaker volume. It retraces downward again failing to break that level. When you see it rising again on low volume, you decide to enter a short position at around the level of the previous two tops, you place stoploss at a little bit above that level (there's some judgement involved in learning how to set stoploss well), and you set your exit at some level of downward retracement for example based on fib levels (there is a lot to this subject too, this is why people have to study this and gain experience in practice).
That's not making a prediction per se in the bizarre way that you're characterizing as how to validate these ideas. That's learning how to react to what's happening on the chart by placing yourself in a position that attempts to minimize risk and maximize potential profit by responding to what's actually happening in the chart. Yes, it's possible in that triple top trading example that the market can break the level (because this isn't some magical law of nature system like you're expecting), in fact not too long ago in Bitcoin at ~$315 level there was a triple-top fakeout that broke the top before retracing downward. But the point is that you build heuristics that guide practical trades like this that are based on experience in markets.

The probability of getting audited escalates aggressively based on income and a few other factors. If you have a schedule C business that is consistently taking losses they might be inclined to look at you. Other than that, typically you're almost guaranteed to get audited every few years if your income is over $10 million or so. The overall rate across the board is close to 1%, and people making under half a million rarely get audited whatsoever barring some weird discrepancy that raises a red flag.

Using a client that is compiled with BIP 101 code does not do anything whatsoever that is not consensus-compatible with the current Bitcoin, unless the activation theshhold of 750/1000 blocks is met. If that level of mining adoption exists, then it strains the imagination to not at least concede that there is some arguable notion of "consensus" that is satisfied in that situation.
Promoting a BIP101-enabled client is to promote a client that literally does nothing whatsoever to violate the new rule in the sidebar, unless somehow is now supposed to be some definitive institution for making a ruling on the exact definition of "consensus". However I see no clearly stated policy about what "consensus" actually is, nor any justification for why you would even be the person who decides that in the first place on what is merely an online discussion board.
That being the case, it is impossible not to suspect that you are not arguing from any principle here, and that you specifically are creating a rationalization for attacking BIP 101 and/or XT, in which case it would be better for the community for you to come clean and just state that, instead of hiding behind cowardly layers of transparent circumlocution.

No, he's totally right. He's not equating Bitcoin as a whole to centralized online banking, merely the function of the individual computer acting as wallet is analogous, in the sense that when you "hold" BTC on a computer, you're merely holding the keys to produce transactions against outputs in the utxo set which is derived in a full node from the blockchain. This is very much the same concept as having a password for online banking.

There is nothing to prevent people from building their own architecture exactly like the Darkcoin masternodes system to run using Bitcoin as the payment rails, other than a hand-wavy dismissal from Evan Duffield that it would be prohibitively expensive. The specifics of how people chose to run p2p software on top of Bitcoin is not necessarily critical to the design of the underlying consensus. For example in principle you could build an SPV client that contributes some p2p functionality, by way of say relaying transactions (even if its not full validating). Consensus-compatible heterogeneity in clients is very possible without resorting to altcoins.

There is nothing specific to monero inherent to that feature, any cryptocurrency wallet can be programmed to include those features without changing anything to do with the design of the coin.
These kind of claims confuse the entire issue, because the privacy feature inherent to monero is the signature scheme, which resists the analysis of transaction linkages on the blockchain, and not anything to do with p2p-related communications code that resists IP surveilance. Furthermore these kinds of comparisons are misguided apples-to-oranges claims, because in the Bitcoin world, privacy features are expected to be implemented by wallet developers and not in the reference client per se, but since the signature scheme of monero cannot support SPV, these kinds of features have to be bundled into the full node wallet.

I disagree completely with the obvious implications of this question. This is a totally valid set of questions for a specific entrepreneur or investor to ask, but I do not feel it's appropriate for the actual technical development of the system to be beholden to these opinions. The most important thing is that Bitcoin is able to grow as rapidly as possible while still acceptably safely (which of course is a highly contentious judgement call conducive to actual debate), because none of our navel-gazing opinions about Bitcoin matter if folks are not inclined to use it. Bitcoin's infancy is not the time to turn the tx fee spigot to suck Peter Todd's mythical $20 wiretransfers out of people, and I could not possibly be more categorically opposed to any attempts to repurpose system specifications as economic control levers of any kind.

These terms don't really have extremely-precise definitions because there is a great heterogeneity in what concepts and agendas people using these terms carry with them.
Generally-speaking, "virtual" is a pejorative used to signal incredulity with Bitcoin or to patronize it. "Digital" is probably a better term for what people objectively are trying to mean by "virtual". 
"Cryptographic" or "cryptocurrency" is the most accurate term for Bitcoin or any similar altcoin (or even XRP) because it conveys the sense that the security is performed by the application of cryptographic primitives.
So basically I think your question is basically right. "Virtual currency" is generally a douchey way to say "digital currency", and "cryptocurrency" is a specific kind of digital currency.

This is not a privacy objection, but a much more fundamental opsec problem. Signing a transaction reveals the public key to the network in the transaction, whereas the address itself is a double hash of the public key. Repeatedly signing with the same public key exposes you to potential attacks against ECDSA if there is any flaw in the way your wallet goes about producing signatures.

Are command-line arguments so objectionable as to justify some perverse nesting doll approach to conf files?
It's critical that it works this way, because conf files (equivalent to how ini files used to be used in Windows) have to be in /home (or equivalent) in a multi-user OS environment, otherwise you end up with the exact impetus for creating the Windows registry.
The main quirk here for Bitcoin is why the location of the blockchain data is subsumed by -datadir and not separated into another parameter, because that would allow for %APPDATA%\Bitcoin\ or $HOME/.bitcoin/ to how a trivial amount of data including the conf file, which could point to the blockchain database store location.

Great Wikipedia plagiarism there.
The idea that this is very clear-cut logical fallacy is highly highly misleading, because every analogy in existence has the basis to be nailed as a false equivalence. Even concepts themselves are guilty of false equivalence, because there are concrete differences for example between any two chairs for example. The slippery slope of taking this notion too seriously is the complete annihilation of conceptual thought.
The difference between false equivalence and just say analogy or comparison is 100% in the eye of the beholder with respect to what concrete attributes are germane to the comparison, so just going around copy/pasting Wikipedia and saying "false equivalence" has exactly zero argumentative value.

This can happen for a lot of reasons, "conflicted transaction" is a term that the reference client itself uses in the UI. For example, once such scenario is you created a tx in the reference wallet, but fee was too low to successfully propagate to many other nodes. You then import the keys elsewhere and create a tx with those outputs that does propagate and confirm. That original tx you created stays conflicted because the reference wallet does not dump it until you specially run that command.

The whole thing is profoundly retarded. Blocks only exist to space out the proof-of-work, and if we're not talking about an open Satoshi-style system like Bitcoin where a sybil-prevention method like that is required, then there is no point even introducing the concept of a block, as permissioned nodes could just be signatories to confirming individual tx's. The only reason I can think of for even using the term "blockchain" to describe something that is not Bitcoin or a Bitcoin-like system is that some grossly unqualified software developer adapted the codebase and crudely hacked it, for example I've heard of a permissioned ledger that uses a nominal low-difficulty proof of work vestigially.

The plan should be to generate a predictable blocksize increase that's in-line with reasonable assumptions about technological growth, in order to allow for capacity planning on behalf of folks electing to run full nodes, and to maintain the intended function of the blocksize cap to act as attack prevention. Under the traditional Bitcoin scheme the blocksize cap should sufficiently above usage to prevent regular transaction congestion, but below a  size / number of sigops that produces a DoS attack.
Experimenting with radical ideas about flexible sizes and artificial scarcity is fine, but should be encouraged as an altcoin project, instead of forced without consent upon the Bitcoin community by attrition.

Lower average block time creates a tradeoff whereby the probability of blocks being orphaned increases. In practice 10 min is actually a very good sweet spot for low probability of significant reorganization versus timely confirmation. 
Targeting for faster blocks does not necessarily produce the desired security outcome one would anticipate from faster confirmation, because the relative security of that confirmation is proportionately lower, representing the reduced amount of work that went into producing it and thus the higher probability of reversal due to reorganization.
The goals that people are typically looking for in a faster block time are actually not necessarily best served by targeting a faster block time, but have more to do with the p2p networking surrounding unconfirmed tx's.

Credit cards are de facto competitors with Bitcoin because the use-case of electronic cash substitute required their adoption. Because we finally have a universal electronic cash with Bitcoin, credit cards can actually go back to their suitable use case, i.e. dispute resolution and issuing lines of credit. The dispute mechanism may however fall to the wayside with the possibility of a frictionless market for dispute resolution services that the neutrality of the Bitcoin platform makes possible.
Long-term credit card companies might actually become smaller but more profitable, because Bitcoin has the potential to take away their least-profitable customers, as credit card companies don't get fees and APR off of people who always pay the balance immediately simply using the CC as a cash proxy.

There is literally no way to actually control your money in the legacy fiat banking system, as you are entirely at the mercy of labyrinthine third-party procedures whereby the intermediaries make purchases on your behalf. The only recourse is physical cash, but for high dollar value transactions not only is this practically inconvenient, but typically flags all kinds of suspicion that you're a criminal. The reason is because you don't actually have any money, you have an entry that was credited to your account at a private third-party institution debited from another account belonging to someone else at a private third-party institution, and the chain goes all the way back to the Fed creating that number to begin with in order to purchase assets.

That's a great point and I think that's really telling about the context to understand Gates' remarks. There simply isn't a turnkey solution on the market right this moment to be bought.
Arguably Microsoft completely failed to significantly monetize on the commercial internet and open source, I think for very related reasons. Microsoft has a storied history of buying and flipping IP but relatively little as far as actual R&amp;D. 
The deal that originally put them on the map was selling DOS to IBM, then immediately scrambling to buy it for a paltry sum from the guy who wrote it in Seattle, which locked an entire generation of home computers into clunky memory management workarounds due to failure to anticipate that the IBM style platform might actually become dominant.
When it came time for a more robust successor, they bought AT&amp;T System V licensure to create Xenix (which pretty much went nowhere) and cooperated with IBM to produce OS/2. This is probably why they profoundly shit the bed on open source, because the experience with the Unix IP that they bought from AT&amp;T and received from temporary cooperation with IBM became NT, so by the time Linux actually came around for serious enterprise use-cases, Microsoft was not in a position to actually understand and/or incorporate that sea change. Ironically IBM was.
When the commercial internet started picking up steam, Microsoft's brilliant play was simply to buy a second-rate browser, brand it "Microsoft Internet Explorer", achieve very temporary market dominance on the basis of their near-monopoly in OS system software, and try to leverage that IP to create their own proprietary internet standards which have largely failed.
The only thing I can really think of from the golden age of Microsoft dominance that actually was a significant cash cow based on as far as I know some degree of serious in-house development is the Office Suite, which is inevitably going away because of MS's failure so far to leverage the commercial internet.
Given the details of what Microsoft has been about under his stewardship, it isn't surprising that he can't wrap his head around envisioning the ways an open technology can mature, since he has proven himself really good at flipping and marketing pre-existing technologies, but not so much at cultivating the kind of deep product development that is happening in the crypto space. That's not to undermine his achievements as a businessman, but it's just to identify the reality that his background and talents lie in identifying IP that's immediately available that's not being put to market optimally, acquiring said IP and leveraging his company to market that IP. That's a very different thing than what we would reasonably be looking for in someone to actually provide insight into the use cases of Bitcoin.
The irony is back in the 90's he wrote a book entitled "The Road Ahead", when he is possibly one of the worst guys in the entire tech space to pontificate about anything moving forward!

I personally think Gates' objections to Bitcoin are misguided in a way that is exactly the same as we see pervasive in among the Buttcoin folks, although in his case he expressed the idea like an actual human being and not a broken sewage pipe. My objection is that the issue he's trying to solve is going to have a very long-term rollout, but his objections with Bitcoin have 100% to do with its newness and ecosystem immaturity right this moment. This is going to be a long road, and not just dropping a fully formed turnkey solution on Africa, so dismissing Bitcoin on the basis of how it has developed to date isn't exactly rational, unless he has some problem with something actually inherent to Bitcoin itsekf that he isn't communicating.

This is a very naive oversimplification that does not at all apply at scale. Manufacturing ASIC equipment and actually running a farm are completely different businesses. The shenanigans of scammy mining companies aside, it is entirely conceivable that a manufacturing operation can produce far more units than they could reasonably house and run within whatever facility they're using to produce those units, and chosing to run ASIC equipment to mine bitcoins has a completely different cost structure and risk profile than just selling equipment. Granted these considerations go out the window with scammy preorders, because customer funds can be abused to do whatever the company wants without regard to cost, but in a real-world scenario with consumer protection and legal accountability the difference between the two enterprises is a serious consideration.

This is not the true waste of the fiat system, it's just a minor piece of the whole underlying cost.
Apparently is so anti-libertarian now this kind of opinion is anathema, but the real cost of the current system is that by monetizing government debt, the issuance of money supply directly represents immediate and additional consumption of resources and services by governments above and beyond their means. This (and other mechanisms) represent the seigniorage rent that governments collect under the current system. In order to prop up this system, central banking manipulates interest rates to spur consumption in accordance with completely artificial expectations.
Even if the holy grail of the most perfect proof-of-stake scheme arose, whereby proof-of-work were rendered unnecessary and obsolete because the delegation of who gets to produce each block is determined by unassailable decentralized distributed random number generation as a de facto block-solving lottery, the very first person to receive the block reward, having expended zero or trivial cost to receive that block, now has a consumption subsidy equal to the value of that block. 
Now we can split hairs about whether or not it matters to what extend that value is purely electricity, or any other combination of new money chasing wants achieved through consumption of other resources and/or labor, but to uniquely single out Bitcoin as wasteful because it fails to hide those effects is profoundly myopic. Bitcoin merely changes the seigniorage rent situation in such a way that competition to collect that seigniorage imposes costs that drive the rents collected toward just a standard economic rate of return, and thus forces rent-seekers to indirectly contribute massively to the security of the network.

A possible way to do this on a regular basis is to create a proof of stake chain that issues tokens based on payouts to a certain Bitcoin address or addresses, and then the winner selection is like creating a block, in the sense that the winner is whose stake is randomly selected. It could even potentially be a sidechain on the upcoming prototype setup from Blockstream where the pegging is done by a federated system for now until when/if the necessary opcodes are softforked into Bitcoin itself. After the initial genesis block assigning the first round of tokenzied "tickets", each drawing could be a block, where the successful staker pays himself the winnings, and issues the tickets for the next drawing in the block.

The prosecution's entire case so far hinges on understanding how the technical details of actions taken on computers and networks are actually attributable to the defendant, so in moving to deny any kind of expert testimony on the subject, they're more or less advocating that the jury is forced to take their witnesses' claims at face value. There is no trial going on here if the defense is completely denied any opportunity to challenge the prosecution witnesses' interpretations of what the evidence actually suggests happened.

For anyone thinking mining is some kind of "ecological catastrophe", ask yourself what the very first person to receive a proof-of-stake coin would do with their newly-acquired practically free seigniorage, and whether that consumption maybe uses electricity!

What he's doing is generally totally fine unless the volume in total or for individual sales crosses the threshold into money service business. Unfortunately in many states it's very ambiguous what that line actually is, and similar challenges are faced by physical coin dealers (although in that particular business it's fairly well-established what the rules are). The biggest risk I think is playing musical chairs with your banking arrangements, due to the potential for significant cash deposits coupled with banks seeing coinbase ACH's in view of typical Bitcoin hysteria.

Amex is like the only credit card I'm actually afraid to use, although I've kind of had to because of business trips to countries where it's more ubiquitous than Visa. By far the worst customer service I've ever seen, it's basically a crapshoot whether or not they just decide not to send you a statement on any given month, I can't tell you how often over the years I've had to waste time calling them on the phone because they were convinced I had opted into electronic statements (which they never sent either). 
Furthermore it seems like being an Amex member just opens you up to being solicited nonstop for sketchy nonsense, including bizarre mail-order offers for bullshit merchandise and all manner of crappy premium service offers. It feels more like Publisher's Clearinghouse than a credit card.

Not to be pedantic, but it takes 5 minutes on average to get 1 confirmation, because it's random relative to blocks being solved when your tx goes out.
Edit: actually in practice probably a touch above 5 minutes, because if you broadcast a tx closer and closer to the point at which a block gets solved, the probability that it would've propagated to that particular miner and got closen for the candidate block that was actually solved gets smaller and smaller. This is all assuming that difficulty is not changing noticeably during the period in which the tx is taking place. Also in reality the hashing of any two given candidate blocks are statistically-independent events, so there is nothing to stop a block n and n+1 from getting solved back-to-back (given enough time to propagate height n, or if the same miner achieved n+1), but just talking about averages here.

The poster clearly means the value as a medium of exchange independent of the speculative use-case. 
It's true that "velocity" is a variable in the whole quantity theory of money / equation of exchange line of thinking, but assuming a constant velocity and looking at increased adoption as increased real value of aggregate transactions is not a silly idea at all.

How come nobody points out the obvious? Both 2013 bull runs coincide pretty much exactly with the US Government sending out strong signals that it wasn't going to just outright ban Bitcoin. We take it for granted now, but prior to early 2013 that wasn't a certain thing at all, so in like Spring 2013 when FinCEN is coming out with guidance that legitimizes Bitcoin as a non-illegal thing (although encumbered by MSB rules), that was huge.
Also the fall 2013 run coincided with Senator Carpenter and the "Beyond Silk Road" hearing which allowed a bunch of bureaucrat twats to backslap and high-five each other about shutting down Liberty Reserve, but Carpenter himself sent out the vibe that not only was Bitcoin legal, but he was interested in the potential for economic growth and innovation in America.

If you go schedule C as a personal business, losses reduce your total taxable income, but it's important to keep in mind that you are taxed income on the mined coins @ market price the day you receive them. Simply keeping coins is not guaranteed to generate a loss (i.e. it doesn't count as $0 revenue). When do sell or spend the coins, the declared value for income purposes from mining them does count as your basis for determining capital gains. As for your expenses, I'm not entirely sure if this was extended or not, but last year it was possible to deduct your mining hardware up to a certain dollar amount one shot for the 2013 year instead of depreciating. Mining hardware is difficult to figure out for depreciation, because while it is capital equipment such as a computer, the useful life borders on near-disposability.

The entire premise is based on wordplay that conflates demand the function with quantity demanded the value, it's laughable on its face just on the basis of introductory microeconomics. 
Claims can be rightly made (at least they could potentially make sense) about the elasticity of demand, but that kind of analysis would require alot more actual rigorous work than the hamfisted wordplay we're seeing, and the entire history of Bitcoin as a system  empirically contradicts this "guy standing on the sidelines in a beer-cup hat"-level economic conjecture. Note the raging red flag in the explanation above: miners selecting what transactions they want to include is characterized as "censorship" in the context of excluding the low-fee-paying spammer in the thought experiment.

Isn't sidechains too pro-Bitcoin a topic for what's now sounding like Epicenter Buttcoin?

The article cited in the story about answering machines is really telling: 
It seems amazing to me that anyone would even remotely call an answering machine a "yuppie" device as late as '91, when I distinctly remember my parents having answering machines since at least '84-85 or so. For goodness sake I had a 2400 baud external serial modem in '91. I think this really goes to show how much diversity of opinion is out there, and how many people could still be laughing long after the technology has proven its success.

Poor kid! Was probably really excited to solve some math problems and get money for it!

1 and 4 are totally legit points, 2 and 3 are fanning the flames of the same old tired trololololol bullshit.

So in a matter of days this went from Gox-level to small local car dealership-level? Seriously, Black Arrow's 28nm mining hardware / cloud hosting scamming behavior might be on the level if not higher, and they're registered in HK.

Absolutely no question. He conveniently pops up shooting his mouth off about 3d printing guns at exactly the right time for politicians to grandstand against him and attack 3d printing tech. Now he shoots his stupid mouth off about "money-laundering software" right as Bitcoin starts achieving some degree of mainstream recognition. Bare minimum he's an easily-manipulated useful idiot, worst case scenario he's a full-blown narc. I lean toward the first option because I was floored seeing him on Glen Beck, scratching his chin and name-dropping Foucault, like the most superficial douchey pretentious cunt I've ever seen.

The risk-free bonds angle mentioned in the reply to the link is the reason Bitcoin is a potential threat to central banking and the regime of monetary policy. It's not in the sense of being a fiat replacement, but rather the usurpation of the debt monetization / open market operations scheme.

Because they are trolls. It isn't our obligation to police everybody just so you can slide under the radar as an antagonistic dick.

I get the general impression that we're dealing with a "the lady doth protest too much"-type situation here, where your typical obnoxious Buttcoiner is desperate to like Bitcoin but needs someone to give them permission to by submitting to a display of aggression. It's just not normal for people to spend this much time and attention on something they profess to not like, when the natural way to express dislike is simply to do other things entirely and ignore Bitcoin. In a perverse way I think they are looking for validation that Bitcoin is good by the dysfunctional behavior of inducing people in r/Bitcoin to savagely exhibit higher status by mistreating them.

In practice they end up being edited by people with a vested interest in lording over the article 24/7.

This is what white trash people have been doing in barbershops for decades. Everybody is a goddamn political expert, even more so the less teeth and employment prospects they have.

If Bitcoin was the worst-performing investment of 2014, then that's amazing. 2014 apparently was the first year in the history of the mankind where no publicly-traded company went out of business.

Stupid self-entitled public thinking they deserve transparency from public employees paid with their tax dollars. When will these stupid slaves learn to stfu?
