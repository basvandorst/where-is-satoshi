Instead of more centralized exchanges, take a look at what's available on the biggest decentralized exchange, localbitcoins.com.
It's fast, easy, safe, and with no verifications, you can have bitcoin in your wallet today.
There is a feedback and rating system to help you select a professional, reliable seller. Built-in escrow and arbitration services will give you peace of mind through the transaction.
Leave abusive centralized exchanges behind you in 2018.
If you already have a little crypto, check out Bisq.

Localbitcoins.com is my favorite, I use it all the time for fiat &lt;-&gt; crypto. Some may argue that it's not purely decentralized, as it is just a website, but it's a peer-to-peer marketplace where buyers and sellers can choose who they buy and sell from, complete with a ratings and feedback system, as well as escrow and arbitration.
I think Bisq is the future, however, as it is truly decentralized. I used bisq a little back when it was bitsquare, on Windows, but they don't have a package for my flavor of linux. When they get an AppImage package out I think they will see their adoption rates increase greatly, as I'm willing to bet a large percentage of users who are willing to invest the time and effort to learn to use a truly decentralized exchange are the same people who took the time and effort to learn linux, and for the same reasons.
Are you listening Bisq?!

Skip the centralized exchanges altogether and try out localbitcoins.com. Fast, easy, safe, no verifications. You can have your bitcoin in your wallet today.
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:06:22
Try localbitcoins.com, you'll be happy you did.

Paranoid is good, especially with money, and the internet, and double for internet money.
You'll see that both localbitcoins and bisq both have escrow built-in and arbitration protocols in place to deal with scammers.
But as long as you're dealing with a reputable seller, with many successful trades and a high rating, you will be dealing with professionals. Go ahead and take a look at whats available to you there. You can also start out with a small amount, $5, $10, and have a chat with the seller to get comfortable.
I've never had a problem like this.

It will be that way until it's arbitraged away by more people using it. It would benefit noobs if they were steered away from abusive centralized exchanges and towards p2p exchanges like LBC, where there are no verification requirements, and it's fast and easy. Perhaps you could buy and sell there, taking advantage of the spreads for yourself and adding to the liquidity.
@_date: 2018-01-03 02:29:27
It will become quite the status symbol. HODL with both hands folks.
@_date: 2018-01-03 14:00:27
As more people move to LBC, the spreads will go down. LBC also recently enabled segwit, so fees will go down as well.
Beyond that, it's still worth it. It's very common that people are unable to withdraw their crypto or  fiat from the centralized exchanges. You will never run into that on LBC.
There is also no verification, so you can get your bitcoin today, whereas on centralized exchanges, verification can take anywhere from 2 days to 2 months. Meanwhile it's mooning and you're still waiting.
Perhaps there's an arbitrage opportunity there for you to buy/sell and take advantage of the spread for yourself, while adding to the decentralized ecosystem. Consider it. Many people are making a living buying and selling on LBC.

Look at coinmarketcap.com Any coin with an asterisk * under Circulating Supply is a pre-mined coin.
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:36:51
I would remove all centralized exchanges. We should all be using localbitcoins.com. No verification, fast, easy, peer-to-peer. They also support segwit now. Available everywhere.
@_date: 2018-01-03 01:36:46
on localbitcoins, LBC acts as escrow. On Bisq, there is an automated system, you can read about it on their website.
They both also have arbitration processes in place. Both of them have well-planned, secure protocols regarding escrow and arbitration. Feedback and ratings systems also help encourage good behaviour. We all hold each other accountable in decentralized systems. The centralized exchanges can just give you the finger.

One should always be using a VPN as standard practice.
On Localbitcoins, you can choose your seller. Choose one that doesn't require ID.
Localbitcoins is a peer-to-peer marketplace which never has control over your fiat funds, and where you can choose who you do business with. Compared to coinbase, kraken, gemini, et al, it is much more decentralized.
If that's still too centralized for you, there is always Bisq.

The easiest targets for governments are the centralized exchanges, and you, if you've given your information to those exchanges.
It is an order or magnitude more difficult for them to go after decentralized exchanges and their users, where no verification takes place. Decentralized exchanges are the future of the fiat on/off ramp.
Take a look at localbitcoins.com and join the decentralized ecosystem. If you already have a little crypto, take a look at Bisq.

@_date: 2018-01-22 03:32:06
Localbitcoins.com and Bisq, my friends.
@_date: 2018-01-03 01:07:57
This is why we should not be using centralized exchanges when trying to change the world with a decentralized currency.
I hope you get your money out. Once you do, don't look back. There are two ways forward for you:
Localbitcoins.com (fiat on/off ramp)
Bisq (fiat and crypto to crypto)
It doesn't have to be like this, folks.
The centralized exchanges got us this far, but 2018 should be the year we leave them behind us.
Decentralize all the things.
Spread the word.
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:54:09
Let me know how it goes with localbitcoins. Once you do a couple small trades to test the waters I'm sure you will love how quick and easy it is.
@_date: 2018-01-03 14:34:45
Great thoughts. You are in a position to help us to keep moving forward.
Perhaps you can make this a reality, or gather the people and resources necessary to get it out there. Perhaps you could pass your thoughts along to the author of Bisq, he's quite accessible on various channels.
Just as we need to get away from the abusive centralized fiat monetary regime, we need to get away from the abusive centralized bitcoin exchanges.
Decentralize all the things.
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:33:15
I would definitely include how many traders there are in the area on localbitcoins.com.
@_date: 2018-01-03 01:25:26
I hope you get your btc out. In the future take a look at localbitcoins.com and bisq.
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:35:39


It will get better as more people migrate from the centralized exchanges to the p2p exchanges. We just need to raise awareness until it's arbitraged away. Perhaps there's an opportunity there for you to buy and sell in your area.
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:09:44
Go to localbitcoins.com. With no verification requirements, you can have bitcoin in your wallet today.
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:04:58
Yes you can. The best way to get started like this is on localbitcoins.com. It's easy, no verficiation to get started. You can have bitcoin in your wallet today.
@_date: 2018-01-03 01:13:36
Other than face-to-face I find the only truly anonymous methods are cash deposit at the seller's bank. They've never asked me for ID, and you can sign the deposit slip with a scribble. You then also have the deposit receipt to post on LBC to help you with any disputes.
That doesn't help you with these two sellers, however.
@_date: 2018-01-03 01:15:43
Bisq is completely decentralized and could use your liquidity. DOGE is supported.
@_date: 2018-01-22 01:50:13
TOR, localbitcoins.com and Bisq. Bisq actually runs over tor natively, so you don't need to worry about that when you use it.
You should also be on Linux. Ubuntu will make your transition easy.
You won't get very far with the debit cards as you'll find out on your own, give up on that idea. Just hodl until there's widespread adoption.
I also recommend you use dash and mix the coins. Then, hodl.
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:53:37
They will ask you for identification at the counter.
Honestly, it should be a red flag if someone is selling their btc at under market rate. I suggest finding other, reputable sellers with many completed trades. Don't worry about it if you are paying above the market rate. A month from now it won't matter.
Don't get tangled up in sketchy business in an effort to save a few dollars.
@_date: 2018-01-03 01:09:48
Vote with your fiat. Walk away from coinbase, and use Localbitcoins and Bisq. It's time to leave centralized exchanges.
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:12:55

Those big centralized exchanges are just going to give you one headache after another. You could have a fat stack in your wallet, while you're still waiting for this to finish.
@_date: 2018-01-03 02:26:13
There will still be localbitcoins.com and Bisq. It's time to leave centralized exchanges behind.
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:27:23
Forget poloniex. Go with localbitcoins.com. Fast, easy, no verification required.
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:01:37
No, it's completely decentralized and anonymous. It runs natively over it's built-in tor client, so your IP is obfuscated as well. It's really a genius piece of software, as is our beloved bitcoin.
However, I suggest you first get comfortable with localbitcoins. From there move on to bisq.
@_date: 2018-01-03 02:25:38
They can try. They can ban centralized exchanges, but they'll have a very hard time shutting down localbitcoins.com and Bisq.
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:56:57
Great point. He who panics first panics best. Don't be one of the herd trying to escape your centralized exchange at the same time as everyone else, and all you can get is a 404. Get out now.
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:27:57
Localbitcoins.com. Once you use it you'll never go back to centralized exchanges.
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:58:22
Try localbitcoins.com. You can have fresh btc in your wallet TODAY, no verification required.
