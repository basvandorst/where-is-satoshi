mining something of zero value top CAKES
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:35:12
one quick question,
i know there are mining pools trying to create the next block, so if mining pool A finds one first does mining pool B and C lose out cause if so that is a lot of wasted power for B and C, no block reward and no transaction fees, so they go to the next block and try to win that one?
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:55:09
didnt the block chain mine a 2MB block? a couple days back
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:07:33
dam sonny
you made it lol
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:28:13
that's the plan, and if life ever decides to troll me harder well at least i have my DEFCON 1 stash of memecoins to get me back on my feet.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:40:35
if these transactions are not public whats the point of the block chain, if they dont get mined into the next block whats the point of bitcoin. I mean lets use lighting for everything then.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:54:04
ok so when does your actually transaction appear in the block?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:45:14
dont be the better person
point at his failures
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:23:13
try telling it to the butthurt victims
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:06:24
i still dont get it?
Lightning only works as a parasite on top of the block chain. for lighting to exist it need the block chain is that what your telling me and that's why they cant just get rid of blockchain.
What about your bitcoin balance, if i 100BTC(i wish) on the block chain. I spend 10BTC via lightning network and do various business with a lot of folks but at the end of let say a month i am +20BTC on lighting.
how do i send those 20BTC i gained on the lightning network back into the block chain? do i just send bitcoins like everyone else does send it to an public address and wait for it to get mined into a block?.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:53:04
so does that transaction goes into the memepool to be in the next block right or does it take more transactions and calculates difference then sends it to the next block?&gt;
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:30:20
back in 2012 i referred all the coins as memes and that's what i thought about them at the time i even bought a few here and there, lost interest and fast forward to 2017 now im getting memed hard.
I should have bought more memecoins

@_date: 2017-12-04 17:02:15
i always wonder can you just use good old fashion data compression to smoosh more transaction into the block?
instead of all these fancy smancy work arounds?
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:25:59
back in 2012 i consider all the coins to be memecoins, now im the one getting memed cuase i didnt buy enough of them.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:12:01
public address or it didnt happen
lately been seeing way too many of these "i made it" threads im starting to doubt everything.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:28:21
so your telling me none of the TX that happen on the lightmeme networks never gets blocked in the block chain?
so your telling me that i can spend memecoins on the lightmeme networks and it will never change the memecoins amount on the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:19:17
i only started getting into this segwit crap, after i had a long thought on the bus ride, more and more ppl are coming into the memecoin game and more and more ppl will be doing transactions which is only limited around 2400 and fees are getting higher and higher.
I believe this will be highly unhealthy for the future of this memecoins
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:35:10
MEMECOINS dont give a shit about you! or you! and especially YOU!
memecoins only know one thing that is the private key.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:48:24
thank you kind sir
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:16:48

@_date: 2017-12-04 17:39:43
i wouldnt say the memecoins are out to kill banks, i think its the side effect of memecoins to make them less important.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:12:12
this shit is confusing to me, im going to stay away from futures when you can get a better future investing in actual "memecoins" right now
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:20:30
protip you dont have to sell coins on an exchange, you can write down the PK and SK on a piece of paper and sell it to some scrub on the street for 20k izi pizi
you walk away with 20k the unknown person walks away with access to that hawt wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:44:15
is there a white paper on this shit i can read
i swear the ppl on this reddit are just spewing memes and crap. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 17:01:32
you guys keep spamming this shit
but all the exchanges i use arnt no using segwit address the address starts with 1 or a 3.
So tell me who is using it
@_date: 2018-08-30 22:25:38

until i see a fucking legit bank statement with actual fucking numbers then i will believe.
until then im staying away from tether and its inbred variants.
@_date: 2018-06-20 19:38:23
how the fuck does it take years for a audit like this, you KNOW how much tether is floating around lemmi check dankmarket cap oh shit lawdly it says 2,770,000,000 Tokens.
these retards CLAIM that its ALL backed by the USD and sitting in a bank....well
show us the bank statement that $2,770,000,000 USD are there sitting in account somewhere.
i have a feeling they really dont have all the tether backed up im sure that some of the tethers are backed by IOUs or some sort of shitfungible asset that makes up $2,770,000,000.
@_date: 2018-06-25 19:15:34
yeah thats what i want gox level destruction so i can cheapo memecoins, and i know a lot more folks will come back
@_date: 2018-06-25 16:28:23
i pray everyday that tether suffers a Gox level nuclear destruction,
@_date: 2018-06-26 20:27:08
why 21M tho
out of any amount, why 21M in particular 
@_date: 2018-06-29 14:34:22
ok they can stay poor and oppressed, nothings going to change at the current path they are taking, let them starve, let there currency go to shit. Fight dictatorship with words see how far that gets yeah.

@_date: 2018-06-20 16:10:11
dogecoin has more tx than shitconecash
i only use dogecoin to move funds from exchanges to exchange usually in the 10k to 20k area because of its lower fees
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:41:59
whatever the fbi did they got it, hell they tried auctioning those coins away too, and i also remember that 2 fbi agents tried to steal his memecoins and got busted.
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:06:49
if this is real man move those memecoins into a different wallet 
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:37:31

how are memecoins the best protection against divorces?, dread pirate rogers got cooned and they took his coins away cause he was facing jail.
Im pretty sure OP will break if some sort of outside pressure forces him to relinquishes his Key if shit goes sideways.

@_date: 2017-11-24 16:39:47
can someone explain what these things are, i still dont understand how they work.
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:37:01
think steam dollars on steam, they make you use real monies and convert it to steam dollars that cant be changed back so its locked into there own little ecosystem.
Now u have a bunch of USDT and suddenly the price of USDT to memecoins changes and your end up paying more than going straight from USD to memecoins.
Sure its a dick move but possibility is real, 
member when bitcoins remove the "trust", now ppl are putting trust back into bitcoins.

Should not apply to crypto, in the crypto world everything goes for greatness or for worse and there is a single rule and only 1 rule i follow by
cryptos dont give a shit about you, or you, or YOU, and any other butthurt feelings you may have, cryptos only care about one thing and that is the private key.

if u are in possession of stolen meme coins i would not withdraw from a exchange, remember these retarded ass exchanges require photos and all sorts of ID that can potential tie you to a public address.
nothing motivates ppl like money,

as much as i want to trust this guy, he has no backing of any guarantee when the the chinese goverment has a known history of raining down on things they do not like with force...

"If it meets the required difficulty they found a block and broadcast it to the network. If it doesn't, they add one to the nonce and try again. As fast as they can."
"meets the required difficulty" what determines it has met that requirement...
...this still doesnt help me....everywhere ive read so far its a difficult math equation and just last week someone posted something about doing it by hand which would take a bazillion years or something...
...what im asking what does that equation look like and what are the operations to do it to solve it?
@_date: 2013-12-20 15:27:23
mining as a concept is ez.....but i have yet to find someone that can do one simple equation of the math behind the mining...no one seems too...i read about as much as i could on wiki....and it just opens up more questions
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:14:39

@_date: 2013-11-27 15:21:36
