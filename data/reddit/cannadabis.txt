Did i say all medical research? Stop putting words in my mouth. Lol
If you think about it.... if we as a planet invested in free education, healthcare, housing for all, we would find the cures to ALL diseases faster vs what we have now where only a few have the education, opportunity, grants to research the cures to all of lifes diseases.

@_date: 2018-01-07 17:33:50
Because they are waiting for a good time to sell it all. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:59:02
Maps is a company now pushing mdma. Thats what im getting to. And btc early adopters who won a lotta $ at the expense of the planets life, are matching it 1:1, not buying drinking water for Africa. Or fighting diseases like bill gates, nope, yall are bout to give out a shit ton of mdma and trying to make it look like your helping. Lol
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:29:01
TL;DR 
Bitcoin is old and broken. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:16:59
Go donate to the ones starving, or ones who dont have water,  or ones who have 0. Lmfao. 
This is all so they can legally get away with selling the mdma that bought a long time ago on the blackmarket with btc. Lol
Now that the stocks are worth more than the drugs, they donate the drugs.
Crypto nerd drug mafia monopoly at its finest. 
Thats why they are using drugs, not helping the starving ones on the planet. Thats why antonopolous left btc anti poverty foundation sighting concerns. Lol. All falling into place now, eh? 
"According to his podcast, Antonopoulos is a consultant on several bitcoin-related startups.[11] He served as head of the Bitcoin Foundation's anti-poverty committee until 2014, when he resigned citing a lack of transparency as the reason."
How about yall and anti poverty? Or you just gonna get people high who have ptsd? Lol.

You know what btc is trying to do? Destabilize well known organizations cause they think they are bad. Lmao. Banks much? 
Answer to my other questions? Didnt think so.

[Ether gas prices are too expensive](
No one needs POW....
[Zk-snarks too expensive](
"Of equal potential is that because the cryptography compresses information, zk-snarks are believed to be a potential building block that can be used to scale the ethereum network. Currently, they're still quite expensive to verify, but Eberhardt envisages a day where costs will decrease.
Under his proposed scheme, expensive computations could be performed off-chain and then stored on the blockchain a succinct translation of that computation. But because zk-snarks are still relatively expensive, it won't surpass other scaling methods until this cost is lowered – or the tech itself becomes more lightweight."
Zk starks is only a whitepaper just released yesterday. You betting all your money on that and that only? 
[Even kik is calling yall the dial up of block chain](

So the coin that started online drug dealing is funding legitimate mdma drug dealing? Lmfao, yall nerd drug dealers are jokes. 
First world philanthropy at its best. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:07:16
I know, I was getting to the point that this isnt going to help the most destitute people on this planet. Just people like yourself and those with money to invest. Even the bankers and large corps have got in just enough to stay ahead of the planets poor if it does take off. 
Antonopolpus served as head of the Bitcoin Foundation's anti-poverty committee until 2014, resigning due to disagreements with its management. In a statement explaining the reasons for his resignation, he said "I can no longer have even the smallest association with the Bitcoin Foundation, because of the complete lack of transparency."

Id beg to differ. Thats why satoshi is a ghost. He/she/they know exactly what it was for so didnt put their name on it, yet i see every crypto early adopter praise satoshi as a god....
Mahatma Gandhi: 'Truth never damages a cause that is just.'
Im imagining every early adopter who isnt a sociopath or ignorant to crypto in general, rationalize it anyway possible to help them sleep at night. Lol

Crypto was designed for drug dealers tho. Lol

Bitcoin looks even more centralized to me as a noob to crypto. I can go out for a walk and still mine some gold today and years from now. Bitcoin? 80% already mined by early adopters....
Pretty sure fewer people control 80% of bitcoins  than the amount of people who control 80% of FIAT 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:01:05
Im still ahead of btc price ;P
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:12:32
Nice. I may just have to look into that if my crypto becomes worth anything this year haha. 
You should check out the crypto TRON (if u havent already), they are trying to build an ecosystem that helps artists like yourself get paid without middlemen.

Child porn on windows is frowned upon, many organizations, govt are trying to eradicate it. 
Crypto drug dealing, child porn? Every early adopter doesnt give a flying fack cause they are making a killing so try their hardest to keep this industry unregulated. Im flabbergasted that yall've managed to get this far by the silly govts of the planet. Lol. Leaves me with less faith in them now. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 06:14:08
Bitcoin is only rare for its name. Theres a lot of competition now with equivalent or better tech, fair adoption, non POW etc.
