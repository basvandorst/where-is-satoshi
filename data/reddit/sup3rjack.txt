Not at all. I honestly don’t care ive got all my coins on my ledger i couldnt panic if i tried. But im thinking of mainstream newbies who are downloading coinbase and basically getting tricked into buying bcash. And who will see their money dump in the next 24 hours like last time.

Lol redditor for 2 days bch shill much. Of course crypto will be regulated but thats not bad. You want a 1million $ bitcoin? Regulation only will allow that.

Good choice! If i can give you a very personal hodl tip: Vertcoin. Currently around 5$ a coin its gone up loads recently but has huge potential for this coming year. Its even mentioned in the Litecoin roadmap :) And its aiming for a very specific but huge crypto market area: ASIC resistant coins (vertcoin cant be mined on massive mining rigs). If you’ve heard of Bitcoin Gold, Vertcoin is pretty much that but with much more interesting features and dev achievements. First Lightning Network tests were run between Vertcoin and Litecoin. So i think Vertcoin can grow exponentially this year as alt coins will increasingly play a role in more specific uses for crypto.

The whole point is that when bitcoin reaches that price, its specifically because you will be able to spend it anywhere like cash. So don’t even think about cashing out. At least wait until you can do your amazon shop with crypto. Hold until then and you should be fine! :)

thanks this is the kind of answer i was wanting to hear. I know 5G and bitcoin doesn't really mean anything together, but if we are to have a vision for bitcoin, we should have a vision of everything else that goes alongside it to better understand what to work on.

lol wtf haha. I know 5g is worldwide, but let's face it, how many people around you rely on it? and i already know what bitcoin is going to achieve. not sure how you interpreted my question there

Some people are too stupid to safely drive a car. Others just use their brains. While i get the point you're trying to make: it is still the case that crypto is very young and an "every day no questions asked" use of crypto is still far. The closer we get to it; the more people will understand what is happening and try to adapt.

I'm so tired of the BTC/BCH debate but this made me chuckle.

I mean based on the value invested i don't need to sell, i can risk losing it anytime its only 10$. But is an app like AirBitz sufficient for me to manage my Bitcoin well? What about BitStamp?
