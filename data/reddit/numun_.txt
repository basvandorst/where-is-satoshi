I take the bus because opportunity cost.  I can buy a place or travel for years if I choose to, partially because I haven't sunk thousands into a car and all the expenses that come with it.
I find it hilarious that people might actuality feel like less of a man for taking public transit.  Might be a cultural thing.

I was attempting to keep things jovial.  Maybe I should have added a smileyface.  Those things you mentioned have a cost as well though.

It shows the fee amount but not the size of the tx'n.  I guess I'm wondering what formula the wallet uses to calculate the fee and whether it's dynamic or not.
@_date: 2016-03-30 17:40:49


IIRC he described increasing fees as an indicator of demand for using the network.  Which is correct.  And IMO is also a good thing.
@_date: 2016-03-30 17:58:48
I didn’t support a fee market either until I spent A LOT of time trying to understand this whole debate.  I was initially for bigger blocks too.   Here are a few reasons I changed my mind:
*  There needs to be a cost to a) flood the network, and b) write to the blockchain, otherwise spam **attacks** (which is what they are) are trivially inexpensive.  We should expect that Bitcoin will be constantly under attack.  It’s in the wild of the internet, not behind some firewall or proxy like most financial systems.
*  Increasing blocksize alone does not remove the spam attack vector. What it *does do* is make it more expensive to run a full node. Which means fewer people will run nodes... Which means more centralization.
* Transaction fees will gradually become more important as the block reward diminishes over time.  Eventually, fees will be the primary incentive for miners, and we need to keep miners incentivized to prevent 51% attacks.
*  When new users are introduced to Bitcoin, they’ll be familiarized with the concept of dynamic fees ‘off the bat’.  It's like surge pricing with Uber except you can still pay the normal rate... it'll just take a bit longer for your ride to show up.
The Core devs are thinking long-term and they realize that Bitcoin’s greatest strength is the fact that it is [to some degree] decentralized.  It’s just an unfortunate **fact** that putting every transaction on-chain just does not scale well if decentralization is important.
A fee market helps keep Bitcoin robust and IMO dynamic fees should be implemented into every wallet.
@_date: 2017-02-06 15:41:58
Is there a way to see transaction size before sending with a wallet like Mycelium?

A hash is only as good as the network it's sent over (I think this is the Byzantine General's Problem).. perhaps that's why they're not considered conclusive evidence.
I'd need to know how law enforcement acquired the hashes. It wasn't clear in the article.  You can't lift file hashes off an encrypted drive.

Jailing people indefinitely​ without conclusive evidence is the part that worries me.  I get what you're saying though; this case may be unique because they have hashes of the files.  I don't know how justice system has handled that type of evidence in other cases (if at all)
E: My initial point was meant to be more general though.  Criminals will always use technology for evil, but by setting precedents like forcing people to divulge passwords is what would make good people less safe.

For me personally I'm always (and still) happy to see a shop accepting bitcoin.  I would never rip someone off by double spending.  
Bitcoin is still fairly niche, maybe if the 'honey moon' period wears off people will be more inclined to do this. 
Do you transact in person?  It would take a special kind of shitbag to walk out of a store and do a double spend.  
Online it *feels* less shitty because we're used to seeing scams everywhere and you don't have to look the person in the eye.  Probably why bitcoiners are all paranoid - they never go outside (jk &lt;3)

It's also possible that this system that detects the hashes only proves that someone from a given network downloaded the file, rather than proves an individual is in direct possession of the file.
Combine the former with the encrypted storage (which he refuses to unlock) and it's pretty damning, I agree 100%
But again, my initial point was meant to be more general.  Ex, running TOR doesn't make you a criminal, just like refusing to decrypt a disk doesn't make you a criminal.

A few weeks may have been a stretch... more like a few months...   I have the receipt to prove it though (I kept it because I was impressed that I was able to buy dinner for myself and my girlfriend with bitcoin at a brick and mortar restaurant - in fact, the bitcoin sign was *the reason* we went in.  They used coinkite and had a BTM (which apparently has been removed since).

Get a SATA to USB adapter and connect the old drive to your computer.  Download a data recovery tool and copy the following files:
"C:\Users\user\AppData/Local/Google/Chrome/User Data/Default/Local Extension Settings/"
Once you find the keys you can import them into a new wallet.

Xotika *is* a legit streaming site that **works 100% on bitcoin**.  The site is branching out to otika.tv; more like Twitch except it allows bitcoin tips 'directly'.  I believe the expansion is in part due to BU's podcast.

basically I just wanted to see all the pub keys.  It's a bit disconcerting for a first time Mycelium user that you have a different pub key for almost every transaction.  I understand why they do that buy not 100% clear on how that works in terms of how much each wallet should hold, or how long each wallet is used, etc.

Sounds like bullshit.  You're suggesting r/btc users brute forced or dictionary attacked your reddit password solely to manipulate voting between the two subs.   Reddit uses google's recaptcha afaik.   It's not impossible but seems unlikely and not beneficial given the costs for any meaningful manipulation.   Maybe I'm naive about how 'good' bots are these days. 
Regardless, if true, welcome to crypto.  Use stronger passwords.

You're not alone.  This was the first I've heard of this guy (been in bitcoin since 2013), and perhaps it's because my government isn't as corrupt as those in the places he (and others in this community) are from, but his views are too radical for my taste.

If anything ransomware is forcing organizations to take a good hard look at their security without doing much real damage.  In my mind $17K is peanuts compared to a data breach resulting in say, patient records ending up for sale on the darknet.
An IT policy that doesn't allow the execution of random executables would be a good start point for preventing this crap.
But this sure paints bitcoin in bad light...  Not that that's stopped us in the past.

Bitcoinwisdom has been my go-to on my PC.  I just really wish it would get some updates.
@_date: 2016-10-01 22:42:44
Installed it and it works great on my 6p.
Off topic question for you dude: 
There's obviously no 'authority' on what bitcoin's price *should* be because price is just what that last person who bought was willing to pay.  I generally use Bitstamp for reference as well.  My rationale for that is only that Bitstamp has been around longer than most (all?) other exchanges.
I suppose we could use a weighted average... ie, exchanges that have the most volume are more representative of actual price, though I don't know how accurate that would be if wash trading is real
Anyway, it's an interesting question; "what *exactly* is a bitcoin worth"  :)

Banks have thousands of employees and run a wide range of OS's on servers, work stations, mobile devices, (even mainframe lol).  
It's not as easy as just installing Linux for huge buerocraccies.  Think about it; they have graphics designers and marketing people to DBAs, etc, etc..
The key is restricting access to mitigate the damage something like ransomware could do when Linda in accounting opens an attachment she shouldn't have.
Holding bitcoin is just a contingency plan or maybe even an excuse to invest in it.  I assume the last thing banks want to do is help fund Russian criminals.

How would you forget about a recurring cc payment?  Do you never check your statements?
I get an email notification everytime Google bills me for their music service.
@_date: 2016-07-08 03:31:27
Will be checking you guys out.
@_date: 2016-07-07 06:31:51
Only if you believe hard enough 
@_date: 2016-07-03 00:37:21
Mooooon.  I'm excited.
e: I wrote 'boooom' and it autocorrected to mooooon.  Keeping it.
@_date: 2016-07-08 19:02:06
Me too thanks.
@_date: 2016-07-02 18:32:23
merci beaucoup

Is Alex Jones your apocalypse barometer? The redder his face, the closer to doomsday.
@_date: 2016-07-10 07:46:04
Really?  It's pretty basic.  I wonder why they don't use a voice modulator instead of speech to text though. Maybe a Russian accent would come through?
@_date: 2016-07-16 08:04:32
He's right though.  Bitcoin isn't going to save you if shit actually hits the fan.
This is coming from someone who's been holding/mining for years.
The real shitposts are ones like OP's, insinuating that economic collapse is inevitable and that bitcoin is the magic life raft that will save us.
Stop being delusional.

You're everywhere.  It's like your consciousness has transcended three-dimensional space.

What is preventing people from scamming?

Our Father, who art in bitcoin, hallowed be thy chain.

But she's a doctor, bro!  /s
Probably went to proctology school.  Onecoin is the true buttcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-13 21:18:15
From steam?  I've bought dozens of games with btc and haven't had to fill out any form.  Just scan the payment request QR and boom done.  It's substantially easier than typing in my cc info.
@_date: 2016-07-14 05:25:24
Saved this for later.  Thanks
@_date: 2016-07-13 21:19:01
Except when the price goes up the next day.
@_date: 2016-07-24 22:48:24
Is that a thing?
Also in Canada we call it an exclamation **mark**

Hodl now hodl on Tuesday. Got it

The WestJet ad halfway through made me chuckle.  "OooOoo, but vacation"
@_date: 2016-07-13 23:53:14
I'm actually quite surprised about this.  It's always been my impression that Japan is a leading country in tech.
@_date: 2016-07-14 05:29:38
That's how you know she's not a bitcooner
@_date: 2016-07-09 08:21:22
It's definitely Happy Halving (or Happy Halvening).  Sounds better due to alliteration, and is more like 'happy new year' which has a count down.
@_date: 2016-07-12 17:01:29
Thanks for the tldr version.
Question for you... Why wouldn't TOR be designed so that every user must also act as a node?  Wouldn't this greatly increase the network capacity and resistance to attack?
@_date: 2016-07-14 19:43:52


Ya, at the expense of some sap with a mental illness.  Have fun with that.

I assume in the US people still have to swipe and sign to pay via CC, otherwise why would Wendy's be storing credit card information?
@_date: 2016-07-02 16:44:34
Thanks for bringing this to light.  Looks like someone fixed it because of you.
@_date: 2016-07-07 06:08:13
Great. Now I think bitcoin is a Russian scheme to subvert the USD.  Max Keiser of RT corroborates this claim
Partial /s for the dimwits who need it
@_date: 2016-07-14 05:26:43
God dammit.  Now I'm now even going to watch it  lol

The Bitcoin Uncensored buttheads' cynicism is wearing off on this community.  Probably a good thing.

Kim sorta looks like my grandma.
@_date: 2016-07-01 20:11:04
Interesting.  TIL Google offers VPS and what bitsquare is.  How is fiat transfered over bitsquare?
@_date: 2016-07-09 04:00:03
Just sell the top. 
@_date: 2016-07-07 16:41:55
Let's organize something.

I was joking (but I knew someone would get their jimmies ruffled).  Congrats on being that guy!
@_date: 2016-07-09 15:35:31
No.  It's funny because it's funny.  Stop being a prude.

Hello Mr Veerhoos
@_date: 2016-07-15 04:47:36
Fuck yes.  I'd say knock it out of the park aantonop, but you always do!
@_date: 2016-07-02 04:39:40
I don't understand how fiat can be transacted without a reputation system... guess I have some reading to do.
@_date: 2016-07-09 22:31:28
I dono dude...   Men dressing as women has been funny since the dawn of time.  There's even a [wikipedia article]( about it.
It's just fucking funny.
E: I think even Shakespeare had cross-dressers in some of his comedies.

I bought all my virtual reality games using magic internet money that I accumulated by running a specific type of computer in my kitchen!
@_date: 2016-07-10 19:45:32
lol ya I was drunk when I wrote that.  it was meant to be a half joke implying that Russia has an incentive to make this stuff public knowledge to undermine the US economy.  meh

You can chat with her on xotika.tv

Wake me up when we're done talking about block size.

Haha fuck I just realized I'm the drunk uncle
@_date: 2016-07-09 07:37:54
As far as I can tell it's like the olympics.  It happens every 4 years, I don't give a fuck about it, and I know it's significant in some way.

You gotta bring a car battery with you

Sounds even louder than my sp20 and that thing sounds like a leaf blower.

The message in this one felt more like fsociety than anon.
@_date: 2016-07-02 17:33:10
Nice!  Everyone's excited for the halving and I'm just like, fuck my 1.2TH/s is going to make less money.  Hopefully the price keeps going up.
@_date: 2016-07-13 16:36:02
Another Easter egg... at 11 mins into the first episode there's a hand sketched qr code in Elliot's journal.  I cleaned it up in Photoshop.
@_date: 2016-07-13 23:56:39


Rightfully so.
