You can find numerous amount of sellers who sell bitcoin without any requirement of ID. It’s also a user friendly website. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 09:18:08
It would be awesome if they make it open source and allow us to set custom transaction fees. Can’t get over it’s UI. ����
@_date: 2018-01-01 09:02:48
It’s one of the sexiest looking wallet. But it’s not open source and doesn’t allow you to change fees. Fees are comparatively high. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:38:18
Buy from localbitcoins. com. send it to electrum wallet.

release bitcoin ONLY  ONLY when you receive money in your bank. Also note don’t accept payment in your bank if the payment can be reversed. Check with your bank when you receive money. Otherwise you might end up loosing all money.

use electrum. 
exodus is trash. 
not open source plus can’t adjust fees. 
only UI is good. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:18:53
current incoming fees 0.00129118 BTC. 
yes there is incoming bitcoin network fees in LBC. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:59:52
I’ve some btc in my exodus. I’m not able to exchange it with any other coin. do you know why ? 
Main balance it shows correct balance but when I select “exchange “ it shows 0. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:00:17
The escrow !

@_date: 2017-12-20 14:46:42
Yes. if you want to buy btc without giving out your identity then lbc is a good choice. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:25:48
he’s sending money to your bank account right ? if yes then it’s better to call bank and make sure you received the payment. The key is with you. if you release the coins without making sure of all those above things then it’s your fault. so be careful. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:50:57
Import your private keys in electrum. 
Check exodus. High fees and closed source. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:10:46
You must be really poor if you can’t afford 4$. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:47:11
How much was your fees if I may ask ? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:21:16
yes. there are some fraudsters who will reverse the transaction. if he does then you’re effed. so make sure of following things. 
• when you receive the payment, call up your bank and ask how much cash is credited to your account and is there any chance if the sender can reverse the transaction. 
• ask ID card from your trader and check with bank if you’ve received money from same person. there are chances that some people will use stolen accounts to send money and later you will be in trouble. 
any problems feel free to pm.

localbitcoins bro 
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:11:04
Escrow is nothing Big. I’ll explain. 
you’re buyer and I’m the seller. 
you start a trade with me for 1BTC. I accept your trade request. 
1BTC from my account goes to escrow and it will be held there until I confirm you have paid. 
If you don’t pay, it comes back to me. If you pay, it comes to your wallet. 
Jus protecting seller and buyer. Hope it’s clear. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:54:33
Thanks for putting your effort and time. Will try this. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:10:37
this game will continue until whales sell off all BTC chunks ( who currency hold futures ). once it’s finished we will probably see a sudden hype. Mostly all investments in alts will come back to BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:22:39
Only person who’s stupid here is YOU. If you’re that poor to pay 4$ fees then you should consider using other coins, instead of being a crybaby. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:05:35

@_date: 2017-12-16 19:39:12
It was not a “ Raid “. More like a survery in order to see how all this thing work so that they can decide how to impose tax on cryptos. 
They just need $$$$ 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:45:52
release bitcoins only when you receive payment in bank. 
also don’t accept payments which can be reversed. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:06:50

@_date: 2017-12-18 14:44:07
You can’t set custom fees. Exodus will show fees depending on network congestion. Maybe you should check on Sunday. Fee will be less compared to other days. Next time try to use wallet like Electrum which allows you to set custom fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:07:21

• Buy from traders with more sales and good feedback 
• Ask for the payment details in chat box. Send money once he gives you correct payment details and mode of payment. Make sure you send money from your bank account. Strictly no third party payment. 
• Some sellers ask for your identity and some don’t. Check their Terms and conditions 
• Send him payment proof. 
• Confirm you’ve paid. Wait for escrow release. Voila. !

Bull run about to start. Brace yourself. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:52:41
I’d not recommend exodus. One main reason is, this wallet is not open source. we don’t know if there’s any malicious code inside which will steal our coins some day. Another reason is it doesn’t support segwit yet and no dynamic fees. 
You can try latest version of Electrum wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:39:54
I wouldn’t touch btrash even if someone offered it for free.

@_date: 2018-05-06 12:55:56
@_date: 2018-08-13 13:01:20
Bitmain has over 1 million Bcash and since they have absolutely no way of off-loading it, they are pretending it has value add to their IPO. you'd have to be insane to buy in their IPO at such an insane valuation with that much worthless Bcash on their books. They will most probably exit scam, leaving a lot of bcashers holding bigbags. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 07:41:38
Welcome home! 
@_date: 2018-08-13 12:24:58
Very good decision. I'm sure lot of people will jump ships. Bcash will probably worth 5USD if Bitmain decides to dump their bcash holdings.

@_date: 2018-06-21 10:59:31
Even if Zebpay doesn't shutdown INR deposits/withdrawals, it's always safe to keep your Bitcoin in a wallet where you hold the private keys.
