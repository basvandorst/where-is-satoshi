It's very hard to buy low and sell high, you don't know when it's a high or a steady climb upwards.

You've homed in on organised criminals that have the access or the resources to put it through a licensed bank. Using btc would mitigate their risks hugely, you can split the value infinitely and move it through hundreds of wallets to completely remove the association

Well that's just straight up illegal, we would all like to earn money and not pay income tax but it's something that exists for a reason. You want to be defiant and keep the government away? Fine, but expect them to come down on you like a sack of lead, they will be looking to make examples out of bitcoiners in the coming months/years.

To be honest, tax is tax. If your in bitcoin to avoid it then your no better than all of the massive organisations with offshore fiat accounts. If you use Bitcoin as a commodity investment, then you are liable to the same taxes that investors pay by buying and selling gold or other commodities. Now if you buy and hold bitcoin because you believe in its future use then you have nothing to worry about. Plus the last thing we need is criminals using the network to hide laundered money, it was created as an anonymous currency and gives power to the individual, I'll be surprised if governments don't do something about the anonymity if nothing else. :/

HODL!!! Imagine pulling a rope in tug of war, no matter how much your pulled forwards you ain't going to ever let go until your told to by the ref. Well there ain't no ref, and that rope is your btc, let go if you need to but don't complain about the bitter taste afterwards when you decide the other team weren't that strong!

Hahahahahaha typical BCash supporter. I'm seeing major endorsement every day! Lightening transactions are here, loads of ATMs  around the country.

Satoshi  is the one!! 100sat or 1000sat. Currently a dollar is 6000sat

Sometimes the receive address can see the transaction but the funds themselves are waiting for confirmations. It can display as balance but it's not true available balance until authorised, obviously depends on confirmation speed though.

I think he means a currency which is not volatile and widely accepted. Until I can use Bitcoin in my day to day life and it stops these massive drops and rises I will not consider it "real" money. I believe it has huge potential and I hold some because of that, but let's not kid ourselves over what it is right now. Most of us are here for what it has potential to be.

Omg quick everybody panic and sell what little crumbs you have left........I'll be waiting....

Why would you assume that no real stores accept it? They already have over ten bitcoin ATM's in central London! Cards are currently coming out to allow people to pay with Bitcoin in the form of conversions to fiat and then processed through VISA. It's in its infancy, developers are working hard and hopefully they will find a solution to reduce fees and transaction times to near zero. If they do we can all start using Bitcoin cards, stores can charge slightly more and have an automated process to convert their BTC transactions to fiat. They will Co-exist, it's a very long term plan to replace and I'm not sure if that's going to happen without pressure from government. However, that's doesn't mean there's not a nice middle ground to reach way before that point.

To be fair I use a savings account because it's a pretty safe store of fiat, definitely better than under my bed. I wouldn't put bitcoin above savings accounts in terms of risks, but I would in terms of future potential.

Check the website VirWox, some people were buying BTC from there when others were having problems. Its some second life marketplace that facilitates btc.

A great past time is to look up what food looked like before humans genetically chose what to cultivate. They look crazy! Anyway, we wouldn't have enough food to feed everyone without using forms of pesticide and even if we did, no farmer is going to risk losing entire harvests.....that's life devastating! GMO's are a way of using the current state of our scientific advancements to increase yields and make more sales. There's a large proportion of people  who choose to eat organic food and that's fine, but if GMO's are cheaper and less likely to have a worm inside, then you will NEVER convince people otherwise. I would happily support GMO's if it means that one less family is spending their entire paychecks to feed their kids!

Profitable hardware doesn't make it useful, it just makes it financially better for the owner. We would be in a great place globally if millions of people had a small ASIC miner powered by a some solar panels and a mini wind turbine on their roof. Green mining power is the way to go if we are to get certain people on side. Probably a long way off though.

If you put in $1800 as invested capital, I would personally withdraw the initial investment and now HODL the rest. Essentially risk free in terms of personal financial risk, however that depends on how much you need the money, your appetite for risk etc.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:00:38
I don't understand what you mean by "real money" in this context. And fiat isn't that shit....... unless you don't like the government having ownership over it that is.

Ah ok, no problem.
It's worth following the dev teams behind whatever crypto currency is of interest. If it's BTC I think they post updates on bitcoin(DOT)org. It's a slow moving train but the segwit and lightning updates aim to improve transaction speed and cost. If transaction cost gets to about 1-2% then it will be no different to using most credit cards etc.
What problems do you see with its longevity? 
It's a great tool for sending large payments and typically much cheaper than international wire transfers.

The blockchain is a technology which puts the power of authorising transactions in the hands of the people. If you want to pay someone some money for a service it's impossible not to use a third party unless you meet face to face. The blockchain authentication allows for peer to peer transactions without the need of a middle man charging their own fees. Now, in order for people to be willing to help process the cryptography which protects the transactions from hackers, there must be some level of reward for the individuals volunteering their computing power. This leads to the currency holding a value, this value is worth different amounts to different people, but as the currency becomes more widely adopted, it increases in value both due to demand and due to perception. A lot of people are making lots of money from the surges in price and selling to cash in. We therefore get large drops after upward trends. (Plus some people are making large amounts of low value transactions to undermine the currency). We aren't in a bubble unless something happens which panics literally everybody into selling, but that goes for every currency or resource in the world. Gold could crash tomorrow if all of a sudden we found a massive stockpile and sold it off cheaply, doesn't mean it's in a bubble now.

But will it be endorsed before some big government restriction. The only risk I can see to its future is other countries following China and therefore preventing the uptake on main street

Why isn't it a legit currency? GBP was initially defined in terms of gold, a resource deemed valuable enough to the current population. If the currency is strong against exploitation and has a high value to individuals, there's no reason why it can't succeed as a currency. It simply requires retail endorsement for it to gain serious traction, then it will sky rocket and we will be paying for things in satoshi's, not bitcoin.

Nah mate, you're simply wrong. Government can't halt this because it's global, you would need every major country in the world to ban the trading of Bitcoin, and even then it would drop in value but it would still exist. People are enjoying the rise in value but that's not why the majority of people buy into it, it's simply a side benefit. We will move towards online currencies that aren't regulated by governments and banks, it will happen. Your comment sounds like its written by an old fashioned bank with old fashioned profit making. As the global information network matures and starts to reach further across the world, we are in need of a global currency. Look at Zimbabwe, look at Japan, think about how it could have helped Venezuela etc. A secondary currency that is so widespread that even a nationwide ban in China couldn't do much to devalue it. It may not always be BTC, but an online currency is the next big step.
