But again, I wonder how they deal with other currencies they confiscate and can't pay their debts with?

This is the story Leah McGrath Goodman should investigate.

Now this is a great thread. Bookmarking and adding the free and growing Udemy course "Bitcoin or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Crypto."

It seems strange as Bitcoin is money already. What if they had confiscated bundles of Euros? Would they auction those off?

btcnr is correct. Buying bitcoin is speculation not investment. Talk about accepting bitcoin for services, the ease of worldwide transfers and decentralization.

First Worlders do not need Bitcoin for all the reasons you stated, nor should you buy it as an investment, unless you play that currency exchange game. I own and accept Bitcoin for my products to learn and understand about this new decentralized form of money and to understand the benefits for people that; cannot get a bank account or those with bank accounts whose governments feel free to take money from them or those that need to transfer value around the world quickly and with very little cost.
I don't need Bitcoin but I support how it can help the world.

Those that live in countries with stable currency and governments with relatively low corruption will be the last to benefit and last to adopt Bitcoin. The non bitcoin enthusiasts that live under corrupt governments with unstable currency will benefit the most by adopting bitcoin. They are the other 6 billion that wish to take positive control over their money, who do not have access to banks or need an easy and secure way to transfer money home to families from their 1st world jobs.
