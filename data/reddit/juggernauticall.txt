When my girlfriend was looking for a dog she wasn't working but I was. She was trying to rescue a dog but shelters would ask things like, "Do you work?" No, she didn't. Then they'd ask how she'd care for the dog. She said I would pay for things it needs until she got a job if she ever did again (Her and I are serious and I make enough to support us and a dog). Then they asked what would happen if we broke up? I forget what she said but they ultimately decided not to let us rescue one of their dogs.
So then she contacts another rescue, she gets the same questions. Her and I both are well aware of the responsibilities of owning a dog. We both know we're more than capable in all aspects. So this time she just tells them she has a job and can support a dog. This time they ask, "Well, who's going to take care of the dog when you're at work?"
It went around like this with every rescue she contacted. Probably ten or twelve. I'm sure not ALL rescues are like this but I'm pretty convinced most rescues don't actually want to rehome their dogs. I think they get attached to them and just want to keep them while searching for the absolute perfect home that they know doesn't exist.

Because most shelters only let very specific people in VERY specific living situations adopt from their shelter.
