I live in a third world country, don't know what a smart meter is, public roads here are a communist shambles and I live in the anonymity of an overcrowded large city, yeah, pretty much off the grid with all my utility bills in other people's names (landlord's ex-wive's), my vehicle registration as well, my official address for any needed reason is a PO box in a different town and I use VPNs and firewalls on all of my computers.  Nobody knows exactly where I live.
And if you didn't know the CIA and the defense department provided the early Venture cap rounds for Facebook, you must have your dunce cap on and your head up your ass, because it is common knowledge, NOT a "conspiracy theory".  Because you are poorly educated.  (Bonus education for your dumb ass.  The phrase "conspiracy theory" was popularized by the CIA itsel in 1967 to attempt to demonize people who would disredit the Warren Commission Report on the JFK assasination.  It is a propagandist's tool this phrase, to be used by tools exactly like you!  In exactly the way you used it!  Good boy!)
Here is New Zealand's biggest newspaper, not some Alex Jones wingnut site, explaining all that to you, since you are uneducated.  Stick a tin foil hat up your ass faggot:
Facebook was funded by the intelligence sevices and anyone using it is being duped into making the NSA and the burglar's jobs easy.

Well, you know reddit rules for these things: jokes at the top, then the ass kissing and ceremonial hand-job for the VIP OP , then the important questions must be voted down to last.
Reddit is populated by  jokers,  strokers  people who know which way is up AND the difference between their asshole and a hole in the Mt Gox Balance sheet.
In that order.  Just like this and every thread turns out when a a VIP OP is among us.

Quantum computers will simply derive your private key from your public key in seconds. POOF!
Bitcoin hasn't been able to agree on the simplest required changes to improve the transaction times.  What makes you think this "easy upgrade" you mention is going to be agreed upon and implemented before IBM delivers the first Quantum computer to the NSA?
I didn't say who I agreed with or disagreed with.  You have a reading comprehension problem.
I simply said that the people who have the backdoor keys to everyone's OS, can easily tune in to anyone's bedrooms already and will get the first delivery of quantum computers do not like Wikileaks.  And associating BTC this way with something "they" hate so much is not in anyway a marketing advantage.
WikiLeaks is the first BTC wallet that will have its private keys derived from their public key with the first quantum computer.
You can bet on that.

I am old enough to remember when "Personal Computers" existed back in the mid-70's that could make 8 lights blink on and off in various sequences.
Now I have a fucking supercomputer in my pocket 40 years later.
Computers accelerated their own development.  Quantum computers will accelerate their own development in quantum steps.  It will happen so quickly, it will be within my lifetime that present cryptography is completely worthless and something new will have to replace it.

Blah blah blah.
I don't trade ideology.  I trade facts, numbers, probabilities and percentages.
I realise a lot of you "love" BTC.  First thing I learned trading all those years ago is you never fall in in love with a stock, a bond, a chunk of metal, or today, one imaginary internet money or another.
It don't love you back.  You buy it when it's worth buying, you hold it as it still seems strong and you get rid of it when it seems weak or threatened.
This quantum thing is a district threat.  The community's history of dealing with serious technical issues is a distinct weakness.
I neither understand nor believe what you are saying.  Oh, it has to to break two encryptions?  It will take 60 nanoseconds instead of 30 nanoseconds.  Boo, fucking, hoo.
I am a businessman.  I am here for the money.  Not the technology, not the faggy anarchy.  Just the money thanks.
I am holding for the moment, but will be ready to not only dump but go short the minute I feel all this is coming to pass.

!RemindMe 1 year
takes things literally like a fucking child if everybody doesn't agree with her.
I don't care what you do with your money sweetie.
You can bravely "hodle" like a noble peasant when the reality bites you in the ass, or you can put your big girl pants on and realise that in technology the next big thing quite often steamrolls over the last big thing.
They are not going to send you a memo when the NSA is ready to crack any wallet they feel like in 1, 2, 5 or ten years.  They will just do it.  And there wont be a Wikileaks anymore to tell you they have the capacity.  Because their wallet goes first.
So let's review:  
1.  you are a little girl.  
2.  You believe that ideology is more important than protecting your assets.
3.  In predicting the future, it is really fuckng cool to hold definite time frames like "1 year or I will call you a fool in front of everyone" -- and
4.  That is what makes you a little girl.
Shut up sweetie.  Your opinion is coloured by other things like politics and having the mind of a 7 year old.

Wikileaks is a "big name" much in the same way that Al Quida, ISIS, and "Hillary" are big names.  There are those who would argue that all of those 4 things are equally bad things.
Those who would argue exactly that, are those in power now, evidently with the backdoor keys to our money.  IBM just announced they will release a quantum computer commercially in the near future, which will make child's play of our encryption.
I am not saying you are wrong.  I am simply saying that IMO the OP here is nothing to be overtly bragging about.  From a PR point of view, in the circles of the powers that be, Wikileaks=treasonous bastards who must be ruthlessly murdered.

1.  I have no beef with Wikileaks and never said I did.  I said that the powers that be do.
2.  I readily admit quite upfront that my technical knowledge is non-existant but...I know a financial threat when I see one.  Quantum computing is one of those things that will accelerate it's own development.
Everything you just said was to hear yourself talk.  The things you said about me untrue or already admitted by me.
Hope you feel better.  If you are not here for the money but the ideology, you'll be happy even if you go broke, right?

I was just visiting China last week.  Since I was on holiday and don't use facebook and crap like that, I didn't bother installing a VPN.
Guess what?  Most bitcoin related sites are blocked by the Great Firewall of China.  Bitcointalk, and many of the newssites are simply unavailable unless you are clued-in, high tech and have installed software to get around the wall--which you generally have to do from OUTSIDE the country before coming in.
So, while not "banned", the IDEA of bitcoin is somewhat hidden from the general populace.

Didn't realize there were so many communists in bitcoin.
Basically, you are money laundering for your friends, and making sure they get around having to register their purchases with government properly etc.  Money laundering fees are more towards 30%.
Ask anyone who cuts hair for a living if they cut all their friends' hair for free.
Ask lawyers if they perform legal services for their friends for free.
Everyone saying that this guy is a dick for being compensated for his knowledge, service and legal risks in acting as an unlicenced financial intermediary are practicants of faggotry of the worst kind.

Thanks Bruce!  I'm quite touched that the head of the Bitcoin Foundation has given me some satochis.  I'll will cherish these!
Because this scam is international in scope, and the players pretty much known, perhaps the way to go, rather than "whistle blowing" is to simply point out the obvious differences between onecoin (no public trading markets, for example) and BTC, and offering law enforcement agencies all over the world the "full force and intellectual power of the Bitcoin Foundation to provide expert evidence and testimony as required" to prosecute the fraudulent nature of OneCoin.
It might also be helpful to not be BTC-centric about it, pointing out that there are many examples in today's market place of legitimate blockchain devices, commodities and services where savvy market participants are NOT being scammed.
The letter could be more effective if you reached out to Vitalik and made this a crypto community/industry led effort rather than a purely BTC effort.  
Thanks again for the tip.

Are you under the impression that you are the only person aware of the halving?  Do you not think that, given the general awareness of said event, that all anticipation is not already built into the run up from $200 last year to $450 this year?

I ain't never been to no fancy seminar, but I do have a degree in international finance and 4 different financial market licences from the New York Stock Exchange and the National Association of Securities dealers.  So take what I say with a grain of salt.  I am obviously an idiot who knows nothing about economics or finance.  I am not privy to the advanced knowledge provided in Pyramid scheme seminars.
Just so you know, I will be keeping my coins with me thanks.  They keep growing all by themselves.
And just a pointer:  "...if Fractional banking is investing my clients money into lines of credit, real estate and bonds then thats what this is."
Yeah man, that is NOT even close to what fractional reserve banking is.  By a very fucking longshot that's not what it is.
You should probably at least Google that term before telling people you are going "open a bank"

Banks have access to the fed window and can borrow liquidity at discount rates.  This is why they only have to prove they have 10% of deposits on hand and can lend out the other 90%.  If there is a run, or a short term need to redeem deposits, the fiat bank can go to the Fed window and borrow at the interbank overnight lending rate and ride that until their liquidity crisis can be corrected.
Where will you go to borrow bitcoins?
@_date: 2016-07-19 06:22:54
Ever heard of "proof of stake"?  Yeah, thats a bond in crypto.  Pays interest.  The coins generally crash AND burn.  Because, economics.

I suggest that:
1.  Tell us your personal net worth.  Tell us how much of that you are personally investing.
2.  Link to your Linked-in or CV
3.  Show us that you have met all legal requirements to operate a financial institution.
4.  Tell us EXACTLY how you intend to grow capital.  I think you are confused about the portability of the reserve banking concept to crypto assets not governed by the fed, and with no access to an interbank lending window.  So your idea is naive from the get-go.
In short, I think you are one of those people always on the edge of starvation and homelessness who gets involved in one pyramid scheme after another, attending "get rich quick seminars" where assholes at the top of the pyramid have convinced you that "you can achieve anything you set your mind to."
Trying to sell the concept of a bank to crypto people is like trying to raise money for a steakhouse targeted at vegans.
You are quite simply clueless.  And probably broke.
