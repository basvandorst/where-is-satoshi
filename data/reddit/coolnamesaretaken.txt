Could you explain why it doesn't work even if I specify a 0 BTC fee?
@_date: 2014-10-15 14:20:25
I was just concerned about blockchain.info because it seemed to be the only client which was unsafe according to these slides.
@_date: 2014-03-05 21:46:51
Yes exactly!
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:33:34
Aim at the bottom pipe!
@_date: 2014-06-05 11:30:17
Oh okay, thank you very much for these details.
@_date: 2014-06-05 11:18:39
Ok, thank you! So if someone was to send 0.001 BTC to the second address for instance, he could take back the 0.001014 BTC?

Oops, I didn't find it before posting, sorry.
@_date: 2014-10-15 14:05:47
Thanks! I think Filippo Valsorda should have updated his slides...
~~EDIT: how about [this]( Isn't this the line of code that was unsafe according to him?~~ oh I get it now, sorry!

I believe they are in Base 58 Wallet Import format, but they are private keys, I swear!
Edit: actually no, it's not this format... but anyway, I could import them from blockchain.info

For clarification: "coin coin" is the onomatopoeia for the duck in French!
@_date: 2014-11-28 06:03:41
The website is overloaded, nothing works :(
@_date: 2014-03-05 10:04:22
I just killed my eyes with this freaking game but [tadaaaa](
@_date: 2014-02-13 08:40:04
I also received 0.00000001 BTC from 1SochiWwFFySPjQoi2biVftXn8NRPCSQC and from 1Enjoy1C4bYBr3tN4sMKxvvJDqG8NkdR4Z but the transaction confirmation failed.
@_date: 2014-06-05 11:19:56
Thank you for the explanation!
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:04:41
[I love you!]( Well that was efficient :)
And to the blockchain.info dev: you might want to make it more explicit.
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:08:07
There were no funds on the address, but I don't want to lose any of my private keys even if I normally won't be using them again, just to be safe. solved my problem though, but thank you for answering :)
@_date: 2018-07-19 11:21:46
Entitled much?
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:40:27
@_date: 2013-11-04 14:26:41
Thank you :) I assume "yes" to my last question? Sorry, I should have worded better :P
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:20:18
I'm not advocating Litecoin, but I thought that your answer was actually pretty rude and condescending. I'm not criticizing the content, just the tone you used.
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:34:35
@_date: 2013-12-20 06:24:23
Oh ok. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 06:23:54
Well, 50x is 5,000% and 20x is 2,000%. I guess one could also argue that going from $0.10 to $2.00 is an increase of +1900%.

If I want to cold store my bitcoins, is it really necessary to back-up my whole wallet.dat file? Couldn't I just send all my bitcoins to 1 address and write on a paper the associated public and private key?
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:57:14
You might want to take a look at:
@_date: 2013-11-04 15:06:26
You crack me up :P
@_date: 2013-11-04 14:37:22
Thank you, I will be careful about that.
@_date: 2013-11-04 14:35:51
Thank you! I knew about paper wallet, but I was confused about why people back-up their wallet.dat file when they want to cold store their bitcoins. It is good to know that I can do my own paper wallet with an already existing address :)
@_date: 2013-12-19 21:39:30
That didn't make sense
