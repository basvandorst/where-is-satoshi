Everyone knows we have compounded inflation every year. That's why you don't hold cash.


Yea I heard these reasons over a decade ago and got into gold, then got rekted because I sold the bottom of the SNP and bought the top of gold. So I know from a painful experience that the answer to QE and inflation wasn't to buy gold. 


Meh, Who knows. I'm guessing the rich are waiting for the SNP500 to pull back 50% again so they can have another 10 year bull run while idoits like me sell the bottom and buy gold.


I guess this is your first financial crisis ? I remember talking like this back in 2009, it didn't happen and by 2012 I realized I was putting myself in a worst position running around like a headless chicken expecting it to come. I'm sure it will happen one day but when do you give up and accept it won't be for another decade.

I remain unconvinced, back in 2007 we talked about the killing of the dollar too when we thought the Fed was discussing the Amero replacing the dollar, still hasn't happened.... any day now.. it's just too hard to live like that for another 10 years.
And QE was suppose to only last a quarter and interest rates were only suppose to be 0.5% short term not 10 years. Yet we had QE2 and QE twist and cash for clunkers and all this shit for a whole decade and everytime the same people I listened too would say this is it, hyperinflation is just around the corner. And I'm here from that experience saying, It never came. Yea there was some inflation and things are like twice the price however it never passed into gold &amp; silver which we were all told to buy to be a safe haven. Yet those that sold me gold and put that cash into the SNP500 profited massively where as my value shrank heavily.

Yea you never want to hold the Dollar, just spend it as soon as you get it. Income generating assets are far better.
By the way the Petro dollar has been talked about since the 70's and the dollar hyperinflation has been on the Horizon for decades too. It doesn't happen because Inflation gets pushed out to the 3rd world countries. I've experienced all this before in 2005 with the Iraq war and when I was following housing bubble that eventually popped in 2009, I believed the Gold and Silver message and moved my SNP500 to gold and silver and got utterly rekted. I'd be about 400% better off today had I don't nothing and a trillion % more had I discovered bitcoin back then.
So just be careful who you listen because it may not play out the way you think it will. FYI TOR was a CIA project so how confident are you that Bitcoin wasn't one either?
