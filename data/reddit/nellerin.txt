Let's be honest, this is just making money off of drugs. 
Any government selling off the BTC involved in the Silk Road is just as criminal as if the SR leaders sold off the BTC. Though, I don't even think Ulbricht or anyone involved should be in jail, but just for the sake of argument.

Bitcoin isn't currently meant to be stable, it's one of the biggest **experiments** in alternative payment/currency systems.
As speculation dies down, so will price changes. Believe me, drops and rises as we've seen aren't going to continue for another five years.
Everyone is just trying to figure out how useful Bitcoin is. If more people like it and find a use for it, the price goes up, and that's why things are changing on a monthly basis.
Being a stable currency (BTC is more than a currency, remember) isn't the only goal.

Without a doubt, just wanted to throw that there as I don't think the article should be discredited because of a typo.

Lots of people are still pushing for the $2,000 mark for the end of 2014. Though, I would personally love to see it just stabilize around $1,000.

Same in the US most of the time, just as bad, this is just a recent example of how absurd it is for the government to make money off of goods taken from illegal sources.

They didn't necessarily get the math wrong, just wrote it incorrectly.
