No, it's not.

One case I haven't seen you cover: what about people who've realized no gains at all? Say I purchase 10k in BTC and hold it, and I purchase 15k in mining hardware and hold everything I mine... do I report a 25k loss this year, or do nothing? Do I need to incorporate? If I incorporate, can I include backdated purchases?
Thank you for doing this.

Maybe that's what they'll call all the miners that end up in jail cause they used Turbotax?

If you have two pools of bitcoin - some mined, some purchased - is this pool combined under FIFO? If you keep every bitcoin you ever received in a different wallet and never combine them, must you apply FIFO to all your wallets?
If you assign every coin you ever own to a different wallet owned by a different LLC that you own, must all your LLCs combine all their wallets and apply FIFO?
It's turtles all the way down...

First, THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS.
Second, sounds like until someone sells BTC, they don't need to do anything but keep really good records. 
When you talk about the deduction for mining hardware, do you mean that it should be deducted as a business expense? It would seem to me that the hardware costs form the basis for the mined bitcoins - i.e. the total hardware and electricity costs for the mined btc are the basis, and the sale price minus the basis calculates the gain/loss - even if this is ten years in the future. Perhaps I've misunderstood, but I've certainly read everything you wrote.
Thanks again.
