KYC for financial institutions is part of minimum compliance to AML rules. Its not about  personalized ads as that potentially infringes on privacy agreements.

The fee is based on byte size of the transaction. Every input and every output of a tx adds to the byte value. Inputs more so than outputs which is what I think Segwit uses to bundle txs. The fee in satoshis/byte then gives an incentive to miners and you can generate an estimate how many blocks / hours it takes to process your tx on earn.com. Fee lower than median fee -&gt; longer avg processing time.
A standard transaction roughly has 300-400 bytes as it usually features 1-2 inputs and 1-2 outputs. 100-200 satoshis per byte used to be relatively cheap and safe as fee but it now takes days at that level.

The price is high thanks to a classic Pump and Dump like every coin the last weeks.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:40:00
As much shit as Roger Ver rightfully gets and as much BCHs foundation is built on shifting sands. Its not unreasonable for payment services and their partners to drop Bitcoin as currency with the current state of fees and confirmation times. I have a 130 sat transaction sitting unconfirmed for 5 days and I will not send a child transaction for over 20$. Fuck that.
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:39:16
Exactly. Buying pressure is keeping the price floored.
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:35:05
And you have to hold currency to open that channel and sent txs cannot exceed the amount used to open said channel, right?

Hey Arsonbunny thank you for amazing analytical posts. And I agree. The rate of Segwit adoption does not bode well for Lightning. Especially because large scale Segwit adoption would be sufficient to deal with the current volume and encourage further adoption of BTC. Despite being easy to implement.
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:50:23
Since you didnt react to my PM after your kind remark, it might interest you that the tx was processed after 6,5 days for 130 sat/byte. The original estimation was 10 hours.
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:24:14
It wouldnt be actually empty because there could be a continous influx of tx.
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:25:54
Considering the adoption rate of Segwit for exchanges does not bode well for the adoption rate of Lightning.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:24:19
I tried to unstuck it via the browser method but was unable to search the tx ID on the site one guide suggested. It was listed as unconfirmed on blockchain.info though. I am currently on mobile.

The timing of publicly selling all your BTCs for BCH (bitcoin.com CEO) while launching BCH simultaenously two weeks premature was a bit too perfect for my taste.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:56:30
Or just start/sell orders gone awry?
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:54:44
Considering how the financial market has vastly outpaced and detached itself from classical economies in volume I dont see why that should prevent bitcoin from crashing.
As long as assets and trust are put into Bitcoin the expectation of a loss in value is sufficient for BTC to crash.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:05:43
"All markets crash" vs. "No markets crash" are two very constructed outliers. Like I said the mere *expectation* of a rise or decline in its value is sufficient. It can hinge on a single announcement.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:39:23
Its not unreasonable to utilize loans instead of liquidating assets if the expected interest of your assets outpaces the loan rate... I mean some people in this thread are just working a smidge too hard to discredit OP. Plus he himself states that while he expects a bubble he also expects an even higher rise.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:43:07
I know I wasnt able to nail it on the head but I am still interested what you meant.
You seem very confident that BTC is immune to certain market symptoms. Yet I see its main innovations in the field of anonymity and decentralization. And that its susceptible to the same symptoms as other assets and currencies.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:50:53
That should absolutely worry you because Alibaba doesnt sound like a trustworthy Investment even by regular standards: 
This guy is writing about Alibaba since 2012 I think.

Can we all agree, that when the paragon of corruption and gambling is for something it isnt a good sign?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:53:35
Give it a while.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:58:34
ELi5 how do you think this? Because of the freeze? Or are bid and ask diverging?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:08:50
The issue is real though. In competitive technological markets the best, most sound solution is not always the one that finds widespread adoption. There are many good argument for BTC to remain king. But the realization of its ideal to scale could come outside the required timeframe. And from what I gather scalability wasnt a priority for the devs for years.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:24:32


Thats only true for any other context than talking about a currency. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 16:53:24
No, it's just you.

Like I said, if you find success in TA as a risk management tool you will likely find similar success and failure in other methods. But this seems to be beyond OPs intellectual grasp.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:01:46
In my opinion the success of second layer solution and policy makers are the biggest systemic risks to BTC in my opinion. Both fringes, one denying a problem with such high costs and the other declaring BTC dead despite equally glaring scaling issues with BCH, are fucking retarded.
@_date: 2018-08-30 14:47:40
The Binance and Coinbase folk had to be these super smart early adopters at some point, in some part.
@_date: 2018-08-12 15:08:14
TA builds heavily on the Dow theory: that past price action has a direct effect on future price action. However, current academic research strongly favors the competing Random Walk theory: that price action is mostly random. On top of that, the vast majority of traders only manage to break even. So you have a largely discredited theory that TA builds on, with no successes to show in its favor.
So while TA may be useful to you as a risk management tool it might just be a well fitting tool for you and you personally. And somehow organizing your risk management in a different way may very well yield similar results.
Branding mockery of an inherently unscientific method as 'anti-interlectualism' is downright irresponsible and stupid.

That Rorschach test says I am ready.

I think the bigger issue is that Bitmain is strapped for cash.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:08:23
However bitcoin.com CEO publicly announced he will sell all his BTC at the high point only days later two major players add BCH. When it was clear that such a move would drain funds away from BTC to Altcoins, specifically BCH thanks to its inception at two exchanges.
@_date: 2019-10-21 08:48:05
Is it though? It's a base 10 logarithmic regression so the deviations shown by the model are actually huge.

At least according to the wikipedia article, the murder conspiracy was accounted for in his final verdict but was an ongoing investigation and has since been dismissed.

Except the specialization in this case is for most people their full-time job whereas even professional traders are proven to lose money most of the time. And as a zero-sum game, trading is a shitty example anyway.

Biomass to Biogas is a thing but most biogas processes require 1-3 Joule per Joule of energy content. Starch and oil crops are popular for this. So the process is quite inefficient and will subsequently dont generate a meaningful return of energy. On top of all the equipment you have to buy.
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:14:58
Same thing if you have to commit manhours to such a project with no tangible return because your customer base doesnt care.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:20:24
Volume is gone. LN is still in alpha. Segwit adoption might be a factor here but most network congestion came from Coinbase adresses.
@_date: 2018-02-21 06:28:54
True dat. Didnt they account for most transactions in the Dec / Jan period?

to be fair most fiat gateways only offer the most prevalent coins. I like it this way as long as the fee structure is reasonable.

His point is that BTC can be technically sound but would still be susceptible to market manipulations with a scale and skill from global actors crypto investors are not familiar with, you pompous idiot.

Whats the issue that people take with Bretton Woods? We are seeing the limitations of Proof of Work concepts where it evolves into a massive resource drain and emission factor. While this stakes Bitcoin against some inherent value it is also very clear that with further scaling it will become much expensive.
@_date: 2018-07-27 11:08:52
Their current complaint is based on the lack of institutional interest - arguably a key adoption barrier.
@_date: 2018-07-04 16:48:30
But blocks have to be mined and difficulty and rewards are adjusted accordingly. Therefore it makes sense to relate it in some way to a benchmark.
@_date: 2018-07-04 06:21:59
The figure is highly problematic anyway as it doesnt relate to volume or capacity.

This is a first instance ruling (out of possible 3) about negative interest rates for private retirement plans called Riester-Rente which are incentivized on top of your regular retirement payments. The article even discusses other law experts' opinions that negative interest rates for existing contracts likely violates basic contractual statutes.
But yeah. Quality submission with a quality discussion so far.
@_date: 2018-04-10 13:56:26
It matters in the sense that some market participants react to it despite using highly flawed assumptions and methodology. Feel free to read into the discussion between Dow theory ("past price action dictates future price movement", "price discounts all information") and the Random-Walk theory ("price movement is random").
Every one and their mum can account for and forecast average market trends. It is systemic changes that are difficult and, incidentally, the most interesting.

Also what is halal in Islamic banking is subject to frequent changes as scholarly opinions and business interests shift.
Banks, interests and loans are definitely in some way or another part of Islamic banking. I recommend the English wikipedia article.

Because TA is horse shit no matter which market. But its in part a self fulfilling prophecy since traders and bots do this sort of pattern analysis.

They will still do that once you try and transfer those Bitcoins into fiat overseas.
