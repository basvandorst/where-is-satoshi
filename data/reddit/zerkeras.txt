Cool product offering!
Mind if I offer some suggestions?
- Include a page which details some common use cases people may have for this service. Some common ones might be like "Selling on Craigslist", for when signing up for services you don't want to have your number (e.g. political sites which may spam you with surveys).
- Pricing should be more easy to find on the site.
- You might want to consider a subscription based payment model. Instead of a confusing credit system, you can just have tiered plans, or metered billing plans, like $1.99/month base. +$1 per number added, +$.10 per minute of forwarded calls, etc. This way people just get charged for what they use, and don't have to worry about constantly adding credits to their account. "Dont make me think" is a great product design philosophy.
- Mobile App for iOS and Android to handle the SMS? Personally, I wouldn't find much value in web-based SMS, I'd want the ability to send and receive push notifications for SMS natively on my phone.
I wish you a lot of luck with your business! I hope you are successful in the long-term.

Just where are you getting this 1 Billion BTC figure? I'm fairly certain the amount of BTC that can possibly be mines or that exists is hard capped at 21 million.
