It's down 20% (as with other currencies) because noone can login. They're having problems with the site.

I agree, it's biologically proven that what you have between your legs define how successful you'll be in life. Women are just born to fail.
For all dumb people out there, and there's quite a lot: yes, I'm being sarcastic.

Poor all these people selling at 11000euro when it is 13000euro at other exchanges... Kraken is in deep shit there's going to be complaints. OK, arbitage maybe 500euro, but 2000euro is totally unacceptable. It's going to be some reactions. If you want to earn shitloads of money arbitage between kraken and bitsquare right now and you'll be a millionaire lol.

It's important to panic once a while to stay alive. If you don't posess the instinct to flee you'll be crushed by the fittest.

If you don't plan on buying or selling, I recommend Kraken. Kraken is a great exchange for non-trading purposes. If you also like ERROR 520 messages, I highly recommend Kraken. I personally like all of these things, so I use Kraken daily.

Got intel that Satoshi Nakamoto is a woman from quite a reliable source. He did a full naked body-check and can confirm the gender.

You'll be laughing at the good bargain you did 1 year from now, don't worry. I think you'll already be laughing by end Jan 2018 ;)

I like the thrill of not knowing wether Kraken has sold my coins or not. It just gives me a rush. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:14:44
Moving down, because maybe people are prevented from buying because they can't login to buy. I for sure would buy at these levels but I cant log in so.
