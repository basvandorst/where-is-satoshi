like ? the only option I heard of is localbitcoins which requires linking a bank account (which has KYC)

Where can I buy $10 worth of crypto without insane charges though ? If I use coinbase I lose a couple bucks to fees every time, and I do not want to do a bank transfer for $10....

When was bitcoin ever given away by the thousands for free???
@_date: 2019-11-02 14:47:20
Probably not.

$12 coffee in Alabama ? What the fuck ?

How much was on there ?
@_date: 2019-12-04 04:55:03
In the next 20 years, maybe. 5 is nothing.

Really fast. I kind of doubt it's organic. I guess it doesn't matter if it boosts consumer confidence.

Multinational banks have literally trillions of money to throw around. They could easily manipulate the market. If I was a giant bank, that's what I'd be doing....

Someone smart recommended I throw $50-100 into bitcoin back in 2010. I spent the money on pot instead. Genius.

Call me an optimist, but I think people are just selling off their coins for some holiday cash. I think now is a good time to buy, it's going to go back up. Not to the crazy manipulated price of 20k or whatever but I think they will stabilize around 5-7k in the next year.

Where do  you guys think it will bottom out ? I still have faith in the currency, but not its current valuation. I'll buy some when it's consistently bottomed out for a little while then watch it slowly climb back up. Maybe I can actually afford a whole bitcoin someday, hehe.

Seems convenient but extremely insecure.

If you invested when it was high then... yeah... that could hurt... 6-10k coins were still hugely inflated from the 20k debacle if you ask me. I don't even invest, just play around and buy a couple hundred dollars worth when the price tanks. So far every time it's gone back up.

Tether is the only one I saw that retained value, and I think that has to do with the coins backing itself.

Saaame here, hope it goes down to 6 but I feel bad for anyone who bought high....
@_date: 2019-09-25 17:34:59
Every time it crashed it still remained higher in the end then it did at the beginning of the cycle and then went up higher for the next one.

Gemini is shady as fuck, as soon as I signed up there I started getting spam emails from random sites. Never before.

What if I've only lost massive amounts of btc value ? I bought most of my btc around 6-8k, now it's at 4... but also way less then like $1000 just to play around. I should get a tax credit or something, heh. Buying on the recent dip has been my only 'profit' of about $20.

How big is the blockchain now ?

Dumped tons of profit in so they could do it all over again to scale.
