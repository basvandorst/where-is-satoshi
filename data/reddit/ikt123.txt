Normalcy bias is a mental state people enter when facing a disaster, Europe is not facing a literal disaster. Europe is a continent with 10+ countries in it, all with varying economic states and situations.
"The eurozone economy grew by 0.3% in the last three months of 2014, faster than expected." isn't the place an economy goes to when it's on the brink of collapse. Greece is what an economy looks like when it's on the edge of collapse, but simply extrapolating Greece to a much wider margin is silly.

50% of the U.S. population will be killed in a bio-weapons attack in 2009. - Alex Jones 
I bring that up because that was the last time I told someone I think that's unlikely and they said the same thing you just said.
Fear + doom and gloom sells these days, most of it is overhyped and under delivers + bitcoin doesn't need to be a saviour currency, it is too good a technology to be relegated to just a currency to be used when a country is in tough economic times.

To live in, try not to take it too literally, I don't honestly expect you to go around finding blog posts pointing out how horrible those places are, that would be a classic case of confirmation bias.

What use is an exploit if you already have the pictures via phishing?

It's entirely true that many people will be confused by this, but I strongly doubt it will have any major effect on the currency as a whole, most importantly because anyone discussing bitcoin could immediately counter with, "no that's 1 millionth of a bitcoin." If arguments against something can be dismissed so easily they don't tend to cause major issues.
Personal opinion: By far and above the most scary thing that I've seen drives 99% of people away is that they don't know how it works, they don't know how much it's worth, where they can buy stuff, how can you trust something as important as money with something you have no idea about it? 
The biggest hurdle is making bitcoin as simple as here's a dollar go buy something, (it likely won't involve QR codes), whether we call that bits, bobs, milibits or whatever, highly likely in the end won't matter, knowing that they can trust it and as per that classic mastercard ad "for everything else", being able to use bitcoin to purchase anything anywhere, is far more important.

i see downvotes but just know that some of us appreciate it

Honestly if people are scared of people not taking bitcoin seriously calling your 1 cent a 'mickey' is the best way to do it.

If anyone from coinbase can see this, can you unleash your ui and just disable the ability to purchase/sell? 
Small chance but figured may as well try

Constantly reformat? Maybe you fell on your head and are thinking of windows?
Nobody in the Linux world constantly has to reformat.

I dual boot for games, everything else I boot into Linux for.
To be fair I don't play games that often
