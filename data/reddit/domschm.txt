It's allowed to install CCTVs on your property, and capture it.
It's just not allowed to capture the neigberhood or public places with it. And that's fine.

Then Bitcoin is the best choice (IMHO).
In terms of development, decentralization and security, bitcoin is the most solid one. 
If you hold bitcoin (in your own wallet, do not store them on an exchange), you will also hold these coins in all deriving hardforks.

It should be clear that UASF is a community driven initiative, and not done by Core.
