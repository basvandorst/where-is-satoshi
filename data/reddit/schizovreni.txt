Hey thats my post! (posted that several years ago a few times)

no option like that available. the app is really simple but apart from the fee problem a really nice and fast app
@_date: 2014-07-23 10:33:19
dude its pretty clear to anyone that fiat currencies are more stable than bitcoin right now.

Even i'm a btc enthusiast i have to admit that cash is still more handy. But when i see a restaurant which accepts bitcoin i HAVE TO use it, even tho i cannot find a logical reason not to use cash :D.

Wow this is really stupid  
Edit: Why would you wanna pay a beer in btc? its so much easier in cash and anonymous as well...
@_date: 2014-02-27 23:11:31
you're absolutely right but your post yesterday encouraged this kind of actions IMO.
@_date: 2014-03-17 08:38:27
Why i think this is big:  
- Many people there have no bank account, but a mobile phone. Bitcoi could be the perfect start into a "savings account"  
- indonesia is the forth largest country and people love to adopt new technological things (see twitter usage statistics)  
- People dont give a sit what the govt is saying. If it is putting restrictions on btc, people will still use it.
@_date: 2014-12-04 03:15:15
Dude wtf that statement. I can tell you even those people do not use western toilets, many of them are really smart.
@_date: 2014-02-04 19:29:13
Even tho i'm a bitcoin fanboy, i would not recommend writing a paper about that subject. Maybe if you are into cryptography or computer science. But from a finance point of view, i guess most questions are either answered or not possible to answer in a scientific way. If you do find some industrial partner which has questions that need to be answered, its something different. But for now, i think its better to find a subject which is somehow related to bitcoin but not a purely bitcoin subject. I might get downvoted for this but in my opinion there is much more important and very interesting other things to write about.
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:30:53
sorry guys read my other replies, i forgot to mention that... the price they offer you is much too high...

I report ads like this on a regular basis. This must be a scam since the payment method is paypal and the buyer pays more than 900$ for one bitcoin. I can not imagine why this would not be a scam. Probably he is going to use chargeback feature of paypal once he got the btc...

This stuff has nothing to do with the discussion on bitcoin. You just posting some random shit to increase the hate between those two nations. Shure its stupid that the indo central bank is making those statements. I can also give you some statements of abbott in davos that shows some kind disrespect towards indonesia. How can you beleve that indonesia sees australia as their biggest threat? It is a multilateral country and for shure in every country you can find some bad sentiments for a neighbouring country. But overall, there is not a really negative sentiment in indonesia about australians, as there is no overall negative sentiments in australia towards indonesians. Go ask the guys over at about their opinion, i am shure that they wont see aussies as their biggest threat...

Scope: Bitcoin core 0.9 makes improvements that make it difficult to use transaction malleability. Then how to install it. Then what is transaction malleability for noobs. It is more difficult with 0.9 to write manipulated transactions into a block. Mike Hearn said, that the problem isn't fully solved tho. More updates on that issue are necessary.  
Mt. Gox went down a few weeks because of transaction malleability. Strongly simplified this can be explained that transaction malleability confuses systems which use bitcoin. Its not yet 100% clear if this was really the cause of the insolvency of mt gox. Transaction malleability is not a flaw of the bitcoin ecosystem but more of the implementation in marketplaces like mt gox. Mt gox code has been leaked and submitted into the net.  
Since this week, it is possible to login to mt gox and see the balance. Mt gox sais this doesnt mean anything. 200'000 btc found again.  
  
This is just a really rudimentary summary of whats written there

read my other reply that answeres that question. i will post a link to such a seller if i see one next time.  
edit: ok this one's one of the less extreme examples (i didnt yet report him), but also here its pretty clear that this MUST be a scam:   
(nobody will buy bitcoin for 740 dollar now). Just today i found another paypal dude who offered more than 800 per coin. Note that sells on localbitcoin normally go well below the current marketprice.

isnt it technically possible to regulate bitcoin? lets say a country wants to make bitcoin their official currency. if they buy bitcoin for one billion or even more, and everyone knows how much they have, they can make effective fiscal policy and control the price with almost just the same fiscal tools like any central bank, except dumping more money on the market??
@_date: 2014-08-01 12:12:29
haha you got a point there :D.. The thing is just that most people here in this subreddit want to promote our beloved currency to a wider flock of people than jsut programmers and engineers. And in order to do so it would help if it looks more professional... just an idea tho
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:29:58
sorry, i didnt make this point clear. yes i report them without transaction for the reason that they offer to buy bitcoin at sometuimes almost double the actual market price. Honestly.. why really wants to buy bitcoin for more than 800$??

I can make payments within the EU with SEPA, which is free and executed within 1 day. Did you miss something?
@_date: 2014-07-27 09:46:10
yes you essentially need to. at this point, you could technically also send a transaction without fee, but you can never be guaranteed that it will be included into a block, since you dont give any fee to the miners.
@_date: 2014-02-03 20:26:53
"less buying and selling is going on during times of stability". Isnt the right answer that it is stable because there is less selling and buying going on?

dudes stop being always sarcastic on this subject. Shure it is easier for shady and illegal businesses to exchange money now with bitcoin. How can you ignore that fact over and over again.
@_date: 2014-07-26 20:05:57
this is really nice since they could never have a paypal account and had to change their bank several times because of the produce they sell. bitcoin seems like the perfect way to accept payments for them. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 03:13:54
Ok i see. You got a valid point. But i'm sure that there are localbitcoin guys around in many places in india. Also if the demand for money transfer with btc would be higher, then there would be more exchange businesses. So the important step is to reach market adoption i guess.
@_date: 2014-08-14 22:03:47

I saw those indian people queuing last sunday at a local western union branch. They are waiting for hours to transfer their money for exorbitant fees. This is a sign for me that bitcoin is still in its early adoper phase and the boom is yet to come!

nice one bro!
@_date: 2014-02-02 14:50:20
It's the exact opposite. when you download an app on android, you have to accept before download all the permissions you want to give it (for example location, contacts). On iOS you download the app without permitting anything, and then afterwards you can always allow or block certain permissions. I am actually fed up with android and ios, but in terms of security and privacy, i think iOS has the upper hand. Still i am thinking about buying an android just because of the retarded perception apple has with bitcoin apps...
@_date: 2014-07-28 18:45:46
Is the fees lower now or still around 0.50$???
@_date: 2014-01-15 10:52:32
i uploaded my wallet to google drive.. why? because i beleve that the risk of losing my laptop or harddrive is much higher than the risk of my data being stolen by google or someone else from google drive. And anyway, i have my wallet encrypted, so why not backup it in the cloud?
@_date: 2014-03-03 10:41:58
on the other hand its sad to see that this shit seems to work. othrwhise they would not com back withing days after their accounts are deleted...
@_date: 2014-08-16 16:37:02
bitcoin is global but online wallet services are comlying with certain regulations. Only use them to exchange fiat. I would strongly recommend every user to host their own btc... isnt that what bitcoin is all about??
@_date: 2014-03-17 08:34:29
i dont know what to think of this.. Why is he stressing that he didnt even know the term? The bitcom thing anyway happened in the AP interview afterwards. Why did he admit thta he "is not involved anymore"? He must know more about it to know that satoshi is not involved anymore.
@_date: 2014-01-26 14:01:49
the problem is i still have btc in there and i want to get it out...

People working here in construction can build a house back home and have internet access etc.. Dont underestimate those guys

Holy shit and i got my coins out 3 days before transactions were halted! :S (i even feel bad about it because o all he other people who have coins stuck). Whats happening here is a disaster for bitcoin, but also reflects that mtgox was a big player with a strong influence on the industry as one of the first exchanges out there.
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:19:45
oh yea you might be right

@_date: 2014-02-28 10:05:35
glad to hear that! i would simply not overrate the issue to the point of saying that mtgox is still solvent. I hate all that speculation that there is around at the moment. Time will tell what the situation is.

maybe i have to add that sending and receiving btc works fine, and i do NOT think its a scam, but imo a btc wallet app must work well in all its functionality

i am guessing they actually have enough bitcoin to pay all the users BUT the have most of them in cold storage for security reasons. I am quite shure all of the TX will still continue. Mind also that some transactions are only triggered during working hours (i experienced the issue). Lets wait until monday and lets not panic too much guys...

Is he reading? Must be a strange feeling...
@_date: 2014-02-27 23:13:54
Shure the japanese FIAT payments will be the first to be payed out because if those arent paid, it will have legal consequesces for Mark and mtgox very quickly.
@_date: 2014-02-02 14:52:52
am i getting downvoted? i dont getthe china thing you wanna tell me... shure mtgox is fucked up. and shure their payment cycle doesnt work properly. Panic is not the solution tho, since everyone will start withdrawing and sending requests, so it will take even longer to resolve the problems

@_date: 2014-03-03 20:23:51
yes... so every week new sellers from somewhere come up and offer you to buy bitcoin for like double the price of bitstamp. Its soo obviously a scam. Nobody buys bitcoin here for 800$ right now in large amounts.

@_date: 2014-11-17 08:36:42
your comparison doesnt make sence because coinbase is more than just the amount of bitcoin sitting there. its services and company were built in invested using presumably mostly USD

there is for shure a technical way or service tog get around this in the future. But i am asking myself anyway.. why would you want to pay for a beer with bitcoin instead of cash? Cash is even more anonymous. I see bitcoin as a great way to pay stuff online or to send money across the world, but not so much for paying my coffee...

i think its not about helping bitcoin or not... yep true that its not really closely related to btc..
@_date: 2014-03-03 08:46:38
nope there are more tools to regulate. if there is for example a big player, he can manipulate the price by saying "hey, we are gonna push the price up to 650$". And before they even have to do that, people would automatically start buying because they knew its gonna happen.
@_date: 2014-08-11 18:18:15
so the total power usage of the btc network is at least 80.000 kw. In total, there are around 13 million bitcoins in circulation. If you divide it, you get 6W (!!) per bitcoin. So for every 600$, there is a 6W power usage... Or you could say for each dollar there is 0.01W electricity usage. lets put it in perspective: So for, lets say, 1 billion $, which every small bank holds with ease, there is a 10 MW electricity usage.. It's A LOT bro. Correct me if i'm wrong.  
p.s. I love bitcoin but i just cannot start beleving its an "energy efficient" thing....

@_date: 2014-07-24 22:00:10
25 Gb is not huge.. but it makes me worry given that last fall the blockchain was still under 10gb. there needs to be a solution for this problem. Why is it not possible, in a future version of bitcoin core, to agree to a "as-is-state" of all funds for example at the end of 2013 and clean out all transactions from before?  
I could also imagine that each user only saves like 20% of the blockchain, so it needs multiple users to verify one transaction. But the space usage of each user would drastically decline?  
  
edit: imagine bitcoin is becoming 10 times as popular it is now. The blockchain can then well grow more than 300 gb each year. Then we do need a follow up solution..

My question is about the blockchain size:  
Isnt it theoretically possible delete old transactions once a year? For example every node could agree that transactions until 31. december 2010 were correct and save the current state of the blockchain and start "adding" transactions from there?

@_date: 2017-01-24 18:18:36
Its respectless to call it spam. We got a issue here with fees getting higher because demand of transactions cannt meet supply of available transactions. You can deny it or not, fact of a matter is that we're nearing a point where a free bank transfer is faster than a 15ct bitcoin transaction.

I understand proof of work. This is not related to what OP requested. When i asked you to elaborate i meant to explain what do i understand wrongly about believing proof of work is using a lot of energy.
IMO there is an equilibrium between cost of energy plus mining hardware cost and mining return. Specifically, over the long run, if there are 12.5 btc (lets exclude tx fees for simplifying) minted every 10 min, the majority of it is going into energy cost. Hence lets conservatively assume 7-8 btc of it is energy cost while the rest is profit and mining hardware cost. At 3000usd bitcoin price, that is 25000 usd - or 125000 usd per hour.
Now assume an average enegy price of 80USD/MWh, you can roughly conclude an consumption of 1.556 GW! Equals to one nuclear plant in my country.
This energy is being consumed because bitcoin is running with proof of work concept. Dont tell me things like asic miners are more efficient etc because it doesnt matter. More efficient miners will just mean more miners in the network - the equilibrium in the long run is still mining rewards vs cost of mining, everyone knows that.

I've mentionied previously that the current price surge could be fueled by the currency crisis in India. It is true that huge amounts of cash from illicit sources are stored in India and those people are currently desperately trying to whitewash with bitcoin or with other means.
Looking forward to btc price crashing to 400-500 USD, then all those corrupt bastards lost more money than they would have declaring it for tax payment.

@_date: 2016-12-15 16:51:09
Not sure this is good news. Here's why:
Right now employer's around the country cannot pay out their workers due to the lack of cash (keep in mind India is a very cash based economy and salaries are commonly paid cash). Now what happens is, because there is none of the 'new cash' available, is that emplyers are paying out salaries in for example shopping vouchers. Now people might not want so many shopping vouchers, so they are trying to materialize those. How can you materialize it if there's not cash to trade it for? Things like bitcoin is one way and that is exactly why there is a surge in bitcoin buying in India.
Now we can expect this mess to go on for another month or so. But at some point, the Indian government will be able to sort out the mess, by either printing enough cash themselves, or by manufacturing large amount of bills outside the country (this is already being done). One the mess is sorted, anyone who is not in this subrteddit for sure will prefer stored value product which can actually buy stuff in India, which happens to be indian rupees. This will lead to many people selling their btc and that again leads to a downward spiral, which will lead to more people selling btc...
The real question here is: how much of the recent price hike can be attributed to indias currenct mess? If it's substantial, as some recent articles say, there could be a scary drop in btc ahead of us.

It's disgusting how much energy is being consumed by the network, vs the amount of money that is actually being transferred. Thats why at some point we should move away from proof of work concept towards more sustainable distributed ledger concepts

I see the common mistake made in many of those studies analizing the bitcoin mining energy consumption. With more efficient miner coming on the market, the consumption will not drop. The total energy consumption is correlating with the bitcoin price. As miners get more efficient, more GH will be added to the network. You can see the same pattern in traditional mining (minerals), it is called the cutoff grade. If the price of a mineral goes up, places with a lower amount of mineral in the soil can be mined.
Edit: Arguing with others doing badly is a stupid argument as well. We have t be frank, bitconi is one of the greatest inventions of this century (in my eyes), but in terms of energy consumption, it is defenetely not outstanding.

Thanks for your help, very much appreciated.
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:58:30
What does it matter how efficient the miner is? First you think it does. Then you see that the more bitcoin miners there are, the less each miner gets per Mh/s. There will always be miners if the revenue is higher than the electricity cost. More efficient miners just means more miners. Or did i get that part wrong?

I think your estimation is quite good, and easier to understand. I personally beleve that bitcoin mining does consume a lot of energy. The profit coult be higher tho than just the factor 0.9, bcos the hardware must be compensated. Still if the factor will be 0.8 or 0.7, the energy consumption from my point of view is too high for the current market value of btc. Problem is the if the price of btc rises, there wil be far more miners and the energy use will increase with it. 5 PW is really a lot and should be considered when talking about sustainability of BTC. Can the mining algorythm be changed anyway? is there still a way to make less people mine?

sorry yea you're right.. down in the top comment i made a few more thoughts on that. i just think that the other approach via the electricity price makes the most sense and gets you the closest estimation. i'm not shure tho.. maybe i'll look closer into it in the future. defenetely an important and interesting subject, as many cleantech-companies want to get involved with btc...

@_date: 2013-12-09 21:22:40
thats sort of what i mean sir... Lets have a look at cot-off-grades in traditional mining. It is the point where mining is no longer giving profit because it costs more to min than you receive revenue. Lets say gold price goes up. What happens is that there will be more environmental damage because of that. Areas which were not profitable to mine before get mined after the CoG falls. I think that principle can be transferred to the bitcoin universe as well?
