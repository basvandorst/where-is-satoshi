Bitstamp seems a lot more “clunky” (for a lack of better words) than GDAX. Is there something I’m missing?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:19:53
Thanks! Will check it out

I was with Circle for a while way back. Coinbase works here but after their insider trading stunt I don’t want to use them anymore (and I’ve spent a significant amount of money on their services).

Pointless fud. CME shorts are limited at 7% and for every shorter there needs to be an opposite bull, if that's what you're talking about.

I’ve seen 40%(!!!!!!) corrections/dips flip back up in a matter of 24-48 hours. some people are going to lose money, as always, but most who panic retake positions when they see the market calms down. Regardless, never make emotional decisions. Do you believe in the tech or not? Do you see value becoming digital? Rooting out panic’y holders are generally not a bad thing for an asset of _any_ type

Tweet  post on their facebook, write them on their contact page. They can’t ignore it if enough people request it

You're a scholar man

How would you see widespread adoption happening without a massive increase in price though?
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:05:23
Fyi, this is in their yearly “outrageous predictions” report where they predict unlikely but “could theoretically happen” events.

I totally get what you're saying, and it's not that I disagree in principle, but as with any adoption of any technology (bitcoin, blockchain, cell phones, whatever) there is a point where the upwards curve starts smoothing out. I think most adopters "know" that BTC isn't "there" yet, ie. they are securing a small part of the total sum for themselves for the point where the asset is so widely distributed that the price-hikes slow down and it starts being a reliable form of (both) currency and store of value. With what's happening w the LN right now I can easily see this becoming a rather reliable currency next to just being 'gold 2.0'

I'm talking about the coin that millions of regular people are using actively day to day in several places across the globe. The one being widely regulated, implemented and accepted all over the worldas the de facto crypto.
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:52:43
BCH, bi..choin...? 
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:21:30
That's cool!
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:11:20
Shit got real just about every other time as well. August 1st was apocalyptic at the time. The 1000$ crash as well. I'm open to your take on why it's different this time though, always looking to be convinced otherwise
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:57:35
Regulation means adoption, trust and stability from a wider mass of people outside of the dev and early adopter community. Inflation and debt-based speculation is what is ruining fiat, not regulation. If anything, better regulation could have prevented several financial meltdowns according to most economists. Wild-west vibes, heavy specilation, pump and dump and lack of oversight is what killed peoples trust in wall street and regular banking to begin with.

Wasn't a jab as much as a recognition of the fact that the subreddit has been flooded with extremely negative comments tonight from users who historically are mainly active on btc. That was all :-)
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:20:00
My point was that we're "dipping" down to 4000$ 
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:11:23
If one didn't know about the high standards of their mental acuity and reputation as trustworthy, nice people, one might think that, yes!
@_date: 2017-08-19 04:10:55
Imagining a world where bitcoin place a central role in the world economy but isn't regulated is utopian. However, due to the nature of it's programming, regulation will be different than how you're able to regulate most fiat. For whatever it's worth, bitcoin regulation will be part of what creates widespread trust in the currency.
There's more to bitcoin than just it's anonymity etc. the fact that governments cant pump out more, and that you cannot create a debtbased economy around it is a major part of its strength as a "peoples currency", regardless of regulation.
It's already accepted and regulated in many western countries. You don't see it losing its value because of that.

The "real" people out there, ie my granma, your neighbor, are only just now getting used to the idea of digital currency, they know bitcoin but dont even know what the blockchain is. This is where the revolution lies.
It has taken over 7 years to let people know about / trust bitcoin as a technology and store of value.
It might take a 10-25% hit over a short period. Who cares really in the long run. Average Joe is slowly opening to bitcoin but sure as hell aint gonna begin pouring money into bitcoin cash, bitcoin bucks, bitcoin megatoken and whatnot. The real question imo is where you believe the use is in a couple of years.
Also, enough people know about and feel that they missed out on bitcoin enough that at a significant price drop they'll begin pouring money into it.
Ledgers and trezors in backorder for months. People are adopting. And they're not adopting dogecoin.
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:24:05
so in the future if I receive from coinbase / kraken etc. will it make more sense to give them a segwit or a legacy address? 
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:08:14
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:24:10
It was supposed to happen on October 24th but that was the estimate for the actual fork-block 491407 - the block actually got mined on November 12th.
Please correct me if I'm wrong!

Nope, thoughtful discussion is thougtful discussion. Both sides are equally bad, but this is an obvious attack, let’s be honest. It’d make perfect sense to have informed discussion. Which this isn’t.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:47:39
And whats happening now is thoughtful discussion how?
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:19:53
Almost none, but hitbtc.com is - I sold mine there. Swapped it for ETH which I then moved to GDAX and swapped for BTC :-) (to avoid the minimum amounts on hitbtc.)
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:22:33
Would love a boost on this one man, thanks for the awesome help!
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:10:15
lol good luck.
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:15:00
Fee was 120sat/byte - transaction is -relatively- urgent, as in I’d like to have it confirmed some time today. I’m concerned how long it’ll be stuck like this and honestly a bit surprised I can’t up the fee from my ledger like I was used to w electrum. Is there nothing to do?
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:28:16
The point I was making is that "DEATH TO BITCOIN" is about as constructive as "HODL TO THE MOON". There are no solid arguments in either of those statements. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:41:43
Look guys, another paid FUD-post designed to scare you out of holding.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:21:38
Just checked, as far as I'm aware the block it split at was  which was mined on November 12
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:53:53
Broken how exactly? Because the mempool’s being spammed?
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:02:50
How many “to the moons” do you see in my post history?
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:41:25
This, was about to say. How on earth is this reddit censored when 99% of the posts are propaganda. Try post anything that isn't praising BCH to the skies on /btc :-)

Thanks, I appreciate the help!

All good :-) we’re all learning
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:58:11
An exchange is not a “company selling you bitcoin”. It facilitates trade between buyers and sellers. As such, any amount you get for a coin sale is because someone in the other end is willing to purchase it for that amount. Coinbase/whoever then takes a %. The value of btc is always the value it is trading at, ie what people are buying it for. Coinbase isn’t “selling” you a coin.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:04:13
I’m not against scaling, I’m pro thinking stuff through before implementing haphazard changes to protocol :) but market manipulation is not a healthy reason to support anything, regardless of what that thing is.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:07:31
Lots of people bought bitcoin when the news of B2X hit &gt; lots of people with limits selling when it hit a new all time high. Imo it will stabilize and begin growing steadily once those who want to sell sold and those who want to buy bought - now all the B2X fud is out of the way. Over 9000 this year! 
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:44:41
Oh so you mean bitcoin on basically any day except the biggest targeted attack in it's history? in about 24 hours the fork-coin difficulty goes up 400% and subsequently profits fly out the window. It's fairly obvious they're literally throwing everything they have at pumping the coin up to a point where it will remain profitable at a 4x difficulty jump.
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:49:04
So migrating it to a segwit address will give me cheaper tx's in the future? Is there any benefit to keeping them on a legacy address?
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:07:18
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:36:19
Unease because I'm worried they'll give me some dumb "bitcoin is against our policy" or flag me for review or something based on bitcoin being suspicions
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:11:33
Actually, found out what was wrong and sorted it - my bad. Will close the thread! Sorry and thanks :-)
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:02:53
also Electrum says "amount sent: correct BTC", but on block explorer it looks like I'm sending a LOT more than that in that transaction. Any clue why?
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:06:09
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:39:09
You don't think it's gonna cause a stir to them when you bring up bitcoin? Maybe it's me, but I know most banks have this idea that you're basically a child molesting gun-for-hire if you own any bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:31:40
Good! Glad you came back in fast :-)
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:07:21
I get the holding / moving to another address what's left over, the issue is that what's being supposedly sent to the "other address" does not match at all what's supposedly left on the original. I'm sure things are fine, I'm just trying to understand how it works
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:25:15
It's called fraud
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:37:03
What was the conclusion in your case?
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:33:00
Sure, of course things go up and down - but there's always a trigger (to both). Just curious about this one as I didn't really see any events when it happened unlike the other times :-)
@_date: 2017-06-04 22:18:36
So if I don't do anything I'll still have my coins on the uasf chain right?
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:12:56
So while the (entire) ROW is moving towards regulation and implementation, US is trying to do the opposite? Wouldn't that potentially lead to a massive "missed opportunity" (in lack of a better term)? Not quite getting the incentive behind this. Paper-dollars are also "great for criminals", they're even less traceable.

Does Gemini work with CC? I really like the flexibility of buying whenever I "feel like it" and not having to rely on SEPA transfers
@_date: 2017-06-04 09:58:04
So I kinda get the approach of waiting and seeing for a sec is the best - but my main curiosity (if you will) is also more that now it's gaining widespread use and acceptance (even my dad bought a bit), for most of these guys, August 1st is 'just another day'.
What consequences could this potentially have for an ordinary japanese person (for instance) with daily spend in bitcoin who has never heard about the date and only uses bitcoin because he saw a TV commercial?
