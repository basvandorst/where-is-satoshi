How do I not understand it? Users are able to create a set of tokens for a given bet. Then these tokens are bought and sold on the Augur exchange. The value of these tokens indicates gamblers predictions on the likelihood of an event.
This is not a new concept, there have been many of these using Bitcoin already and many exist outside of cryptocurrency altogether, you can find even more primitive versions dating back to 2010 using Bitcoin. 
Using these markets as indicators of reality is dangerous considering their ability to be manipulated is directly related to the liquidity and lack of slippage on the markets.

The market over a few weeks is meaningless indicator especially considering the past history of massive bubbles within cryptocurrency. 
The specifics are that misuse of smart contracts could lead to massive blockchain bloat forcing people to use light/SPV clients which centralizes the entire network. Also CURRENTLY dwarfpool has enough mining power to attempt 51% attacks against Ethereum. 
On top of this there are major scalability hurdles that only have proposals such as potential sharding of compution, but no real solutions written or proven.
That said I like Ethereum but I'm also realistic about the issues it faces.

I appreciate posts like this, the "get rich quick" people really make it hard to actually discuss technology.

Bitcoin is an experiment, just like all cryptocurrency. It goes up when people buy and goes down when people sell, don't look for more logic than that because there are too many factors. 
Don't buy more BTC than you can afford to lose, and the best thing for Bitcoin is to obtain some and use it by spending it to buy things.

This is really racist. Every country has people within it that are mentally instable an kill their own.
And corruption is not isolated to instable countries within Africa that have been intentionally destabilized through centuries of colonization to make resource acquisition by outside actors easier.

This is your best bet, you should immediately power down the phone and not turn it on again. Then clone the entire system. Then you can use a tool like scaple to go through the file system and find data like private keys. It most likely is still there but its a lot of work to retrieve it.

Wow, that is a terrible solution and completely unrealistic scenario.
Augur is just gambling rebranded as "prediction markets" and it has been done several times before on Bitcoin. Adding minor decentralization features is not that much of an advancement over existing "prediction markets" that exist. More important than decentralization is liquidity.

You post in I have a hard time believing you did not already know about this project. You guys really need to stop this sort of behavior. I program Ethereum smart contracts and even this makes me want to face palm.
