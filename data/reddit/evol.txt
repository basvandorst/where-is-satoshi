Investing your money while you have debt is a bad habit??? What a dumb thing to say.

Im not talking about just student debt. The stock market gives better returns than 3%, so your entire last comment is meaningless. Like all debates over the internet, it makes no difference. I will happily invest my liquid capital while sitting on a mortgage. Because if I paid my house off, my cash is dormant (minus appreciation on the house, which currently there is, but not always). But if you like paying off debt before using cash to make more cash, be my guest buddy. Leaves more for the rest of us. 
PS - I would happily get burned on one risky investment than play it safe with little tiny BS returns my entire life. Different strokes for different folks I guess.

It would be possible, but the coordination required would be nearly impossible. 
Plus, who cares about tether.

Last I checked bitcoin can be mined until the early 2100’s. A quantum computer could finish that in a minute. Whoever decided to aim their quantum computer at the blockchain could own the rest of it. I agree with you though, better results elsewhere but if it only took a minute...

People leverage debt all of the time in investments. Its a solid strategy. Telling people not to invest until they are "debt free" is something I hope nobody listens to. 
Typically you want to buy outright (no debt) appreciating assets, and finance (accumulate debt) on depreciating assets.

Me too. I don’t see many discussions about it though. To me all these big sell-offs are associated with the fact quantum computers are getting closer.

Are bitcoin HODL’ers worried about quantum computers? Google has shown their quantum computer works - nobody worried they may decide to have it solve the rest of the blockchain in an afternoon?

Man, I hope it gets resolved! Really makes you question these exchanges.

In the movie they say that gravity is so strong from the dying star or whatever it was that the gravity makes that planet orbit faster. The speed the planet is moving is what effects it’s time. 
It was a cool movie

Speed effects the perception of time, so the faster the planet orbits the black hole the larger the change in perceived time would be. Give it a google, its pretty cool. From my understanding the movie's science checks out.
