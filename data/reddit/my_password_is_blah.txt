What about welfare? How could a company make money when all they do is give money to people that don't have any?

What kind of service are we talking about? Take roads, if it was possible to determine who was using them then only they should be billed for using them. But at the moment that's not possible so we just split the cost between everyone and force everyone to pay it. It's not perfect but it's much better than having tollbooths on every corner and having three competing company's roads side-by-side trying to get you to use their road to go to work. Or what about caring for the mentally disabled? The people who use it can't pay for it, so we pay for it by stealing money off of everyone else including you. Too bad. The money has to come from somewhere and it's no one person's responsibility anymore than it is anyone else's. I'd rather everyone was forced to contribute then having only kind-hearted people paying for it while assholes keep their money to themselves.

Minarchists still believe there should be a government, albeit a smaller and cheaper one. But how do we pay for that government? And how can a government be volountary? I just won't sign the contract to be under their juristriction. Then I get to murder people.

Okay, but then we come back to the same problem: some people give money to charity and other people don't. Take caring for this disabled. There are people that are unable to care for themselves, unable to earn a living, and who need constant care. Who should pay for this? Under your system some people will give money to a charity that looks after the disabled while other people will spend the money on themselves. Now add on the cost of every other social service that the government provides. Generous people are going to be giving away half their money to charities while other people can use their money to make themselves more rich and powerful. This is a system that hugely rewards selfish behaviour. This is a much bigger problem then taxation being unfair because it violates your "natural rights".
I would love it if there was some decentralised, free-market, volountary solution to this problem but so far I haven't heard it. One solution that does work is if we all put some of our money into a pool that gets used to fund social services. Then we spend some of this money hiring people with guns to rob people who don't contribute fairly to the pool.

So people should have to give consent before the government takes their money? How would that work? Lots of people just won't give consent. Then roads and police either won't get paid for. That or they will get paid for by some people while other people leech off of them.

What do you mean?

So we need to invent a form of government that's more accountable and has an incentive to spend the public pool of money wisely.
@_date: 2013-06-04 11:45:04
It's called law enforcement. If you burgled your neighbours house and took their money and then armed men in police uniforms came to your house and demanded the money back would you complain that they were robbing you? Taxes fund public services. If you don't pay for public services you use then you're stealing off of taxpayers.

I wish I shared your optimism. The amount of money average people volountarily gives to charity wouldn't nearly cover the costs of the things governments spend money on. Even if governments operated efficiently and spent our money sensibly. And even if I did share your optimism I don't think that system would be fair.
@_date: 2013-06-04 12:43:15


But how do we financially punish people that don't contribute to projects? I don't want a world where generous people pay for other people's needs while sociopaths spend their money making themselves richer. I'd rather a world where men with guns take people's money by force, but that's far from perfect as well.

You're right! I also never signed a valid contract agreeing that I wouldn't kill anyone I don't like. But if I do that then government fascists will come to my house with guns, take me away and violate my liberty! It's such bullshit!
Seriously though, how do you suggest we pay for things that everyone in your community benefits from?
