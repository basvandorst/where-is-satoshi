Ok I found a guy who will sell me the bitcoins through vanilla - I went to CVS and got a 500$ vanilla card - Can you tell me your thoughts on going through with this?
Here is his email when I asked him to have a call with me, I am under the impression if I send him the code off the back of this card - he can take the money and I can potentially get nothing, here is what he said:
" Like I said I am out of town. Meaning out of the country in Bogota Colombia selling 25k USD in BTC. That why I sent my passport. I dont mind if you want to call me over here. I can have someone lend me a phone. Or if you want me to call you I can go to a phone cabin. As far as taking the money and you not receiving anything. That goes into my amex. If I dont deliver and you call vanilla they close my account. Thats why as proof I sent the coins I have the coins transfer receipt which I will send you a copy of. I already had one guy try to rip me so I know. Let me know how you want to proceed.
