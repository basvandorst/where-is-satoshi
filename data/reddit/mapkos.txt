[The leaders of France, Germany, the US and UK have issued a statement on the nerve agent attack in the UK, saying there is "no plausible alternative explanation" than Russian culpability.](

Yeah, enacting sanctions against a rogue government is the same as starting a world war. /s

So I suppose the the US ambassador at the UN is also [a rubbish detective](

1: No person who's done research would believe that referendum was legitmate. It was just for show, because obviously the masked militia had nothing to do with it. Just one [google search]( and every article is about how Crimea was annexed, even the Wikipedia article.
2: What does this have to do with Russia trying to destabilize the west? And in this day and age with nuclear submarines that can be anywhere, distance of borders means practically nothing.
3: That policy worked great for all the German citizens who were dragged to the gulags. All it takes for evil to win is for good men to do nothing
4: Those things concern me, but there is no possible way those extremists can destroy modern civilization. Leaving Russia unchecked could.
5: I would not currently say they would put people in camps, but the number of Putin's rivals who have committed suicide by putting 3 bullets in the back of their head does not bode well if they gained  more power. And again, they annexed Crimea. All experts outside of Russia agree. Find me any well researched article that says otherwise.

These are the countries that have the biggest impact on Russia. Many of the other countries have also condemned Russia, but a number of them are non-committal because either it does not affect them very much (such as African countries) or they are not in a very good position to upset Russia (like China).

[Most of the UN has declared the referendum illegitmate]( So you you have a better understanding of this situation than most of the members of the UN, who have entire teams devoted to researching and judging these matters?
[During the referendum and to this day Russia has had a military presence there]( The people aren't being treated terribly, so even if they wished to be part of Ukraine, would it be worth risking your life to force the issue?

They literally used a Russian calling card to kill an ex Russian spy. At best they have an implausible deniability. Especially considering a second attack occurs on another ex Russian agent the day after the Prime Minister called for an answer from Russia on the first attack. [Nearly every news site agrees](
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:36:23
What is the alternative? Allow Russian agents to continue killing people on foreign soil? With no resistance, we'll see a new world war as Russia believes it can become an empire again. What Russia fears most is a strong and united NATO, that's why they have been pushing for destabilization of western countries for the last few years. They are literally doing it [by the book](

Yeah, all the little guys who don't want to get on Russia's bad side. Also, why in the world would both the US and UK accuse Russia if they didn't have evidence that it was them? What would they have to gain by falsely accusing them? Neither country does want WWIII, and neither country is really directly competing in trade with them. It wouldn't give them any economic benefit. But As I've pointed out, Russia really wants instability in the West.

And so are the rest of the UN members who said Russia did it?
@_date: 2018-03-15 18:18:53
Exactly what is already starting, condemnation of the attacks, expulsion of diplomats, sanctions and a unified front against Russia. Even the US where Trump is very likely compromised by the Russians have started to enact [sanctions]( since it is not feasible to delay any longer.

No, but if nothing is done, Russia will forcibly annex many of it's neighbouring countries. Look at what happened with Crimea. If it thinks it can get away with bolder actions, it will take them. Nobody stood up when Germany started taking countries, not until they got close to their own borders. Th US sat back and let millions die in concentration camps until Pearl Harbor. There is no reason to let it get that far a second time.
