It's really not that complicated. Check out Bitcoin Armory.

Oh okay, that makes more sense but it still removes a layer of anonymity.
@_date: 2014-02-08 09:36:15
Ah, thank you!
@_date: 2014-02-11 22:02:43
So it's a client issue not a protocol issue?
@_date: 2014-01-09 05:19:59
While I don't disagree with the possibility, I am not going to make decisions on speculation. Thank you for your insight and opinion though.
@_date: 2014-02-11 22:06:09
Why wouldn't they do that anyways? How long does a few confirmations take? 10 minutes tops?
@_date: 2014-02-23 16:46:49
Hmm, guess I was wrong. Thanks for the link!

Since Armory changes addresses after every transaction, does it retain the keys for those addresses? 
@_date: 2014-02-08 07:25:30
Wait...what did I miss?
@_date: 2014-01-09 04:03:36
How do they determine that the addresses are acting in unison?

You might want to consider LastPass for storing passwords as opposed to a dropbox

Fuck that dude, sell it on amazon for 3x what those sites pay you.
@_date: 2014-01-08 21:24:00
So, essentially, the only thing that ties me to a transaction is my wallet having record of the addresses used?
@_date: 2014-02-08 20:24:28
I've always used 2FA for my coinbase. I also keep all of my coins stored in an offline wallet because paranoid.

Silkroad 2.0 just died.

The way I understand it is that it's basically the same problem Gox had, but on a larger scale. Too many exchanges and wallets were relying on the transaction IDs and not waiting for confirmations.

So you're *making* a searchable database of palm vein scans.

You should've been on since like September. It's like a damn paranoid soap opera.
