Dude, seriously, I'm sorry, but you need to really think security when money is involved. I would give the btc back, but it's already gone, out of my hands. Sorry.

Shut down tor and bitcoin because think of the children!

Hey, for a first timer, trying out how to store safely, it's good advice. But once you get past that first stage of figuring stuff out, then you can go all out.

Hodl, for the good shepherd guides. Believe not in the ways of men, but follow in the ways of the holy trinity.
Follow in the way of the encryption, for it is a noble defender of all who ask, but shall never need or betray, for the way of the encryption is generous and loyal. Give unto others, and follow the teachings of Satoshi
Follow in the way of the blockchain, for it is a honest and hard-working, and shall not spread falsehoods upon those who are unsuspecting, for the way of the blockchain is the way of truth. Spread the truths here for all to see, from here to the ends of the earth, to work hard in the name of the Holy Truth
Follow in the way of the Keys, for it is a way of even the most hidden of truths holding the most beautiful of enlightened knowledge, and shall show the path of the wondrous truths in the darkest of nights. In your darkest of times, do not muddy the clear waters of your faith, but hodl, so that the trinity may restore.
So says the Holy Trinity, amen.

DO NOT invest everything into bitcoin.
Yes, a few hundred here and there, but it is still unstable. It's not like before, but it is unstable and you could lose a lot.
Not to mention if you don't know what you are doing, you might end up losing everything to a hacker anyways.
So just go with a little at first, explore a bit, and after a while, if you still feel like you should, then do it then. But for right now, baby steps.
Yeah, you might lose a little in the long run, but you still have much to learn about security, back-ups, and cryptocurrency in general.

Sorry brain is tired. I meant creating false transactions in the block chain, like what Gash.io might of done when they reached 51%.
@_date: 2014-12-14 02:26:56
Well, really it is sort of. We already have the dv reqs for getting into low earth orbit, and the dv reqs for getting to various places in the solar system. We have programs built for this sort of thing.
Really, we could plug in the asteroid we want, the velocity and mass of the asteroid, and then have it spit out how much dv we need.
We already know how to mine, just really a plug in, and we would have the numbers.
The associated cost is what gets us.

Start mining, but provide false blockchains. If you can get to 51% or whatever, you can probably cause some chaos.
Or you know, provide the number that the algorithm uses to generate public keys from the private, making sure that number has a backdoor. Which btw, they did provide the number. After that, it would be a simple matter to just whoops all of coinbase's btc has moved to a new wallet, owned by whomever.

kind of wonder if it's government shills shit posting and upvoting it. We know that companies do it, coke did it for a while, valve certainly does it, and the government would be capable, and would have the motive.

Well, thing is, there are some technical things that aren't so good. There is the blockchain is a fucking huge download, and opening ports for a full node is a bit out of reach for most people.
We could fix those. It's just some optimization issues.
