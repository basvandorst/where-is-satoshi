Nice sound bite

Yeah, quite a few companies tell their CS to stop communicating with a customer when theyre being threatened with legal action.
Sounds like a pretty standard course of action to me.

He has also jumped on numerous tech bandwagons that he thought were revolutionary and in the end weren't and failed miserably. 
I definitely wouldn't look him as being an influencer or as someone who has great insight on the next big thing.

Yet here you are comparing it to 401ks and stocks. That's funny.

I guess being on the internet explains why you're a douche bag.

That mentality right there is what impedes Bitcoin from becoming mainstream.

You're absolutely right, but I'd like to add that that people need to remember that the majority of those who buy BCH aren't aware that it's premise is greedy.
At this point it seems like who ever has the best marketing will come out winning, and right now thats BCH because the guy that everyone hates is giving interviews left and right.

That would be nice.

I've seen attacks against the others, they just aren't nearly as prevalent, and usually takes place inside of the comments of a thread rather than being submitted as a thread itself.
Also, regarding your last point...no one was saying otherwise. I was pointing out that there are very few people who are practicing what they preach and that from my point of view, the people in this sub are just as greedy and short sighted as those you accuse of surrounding BCH. 
If the people on here were really for a decentralized currency then every other thread wouldn't be about it's value in relation to the USD or an article that speculates it will rise to 500k. I think a lot of the animosity and hostility comes from people thinking that their chosen currency will be devalued by others.

I don't understand the hostility either.
Its ironic to see a good portion of this sub say that you shouldn't invest everything in Bitcoin and that you should be diversified...but in the same breath they say you should only be invested in BTC and avoid others like BCH.

Buddy, just stop...you're clearly in the wrong and at this point you're just making a mockery of yourself by trying to save face.

Well, didn't the experts say last year and earlier this year that it will be up to 25k? 
That's exactly where it will be /s

You're such a mad lad!
