We dropped 1%. This is so dumb OP

Lol exactly. Post makes no sense. Should go without saying but any money going “in” is also going out. If someone’s buying someone else is selling.

Was ICE’s comment about Bakkt being a “moonshot bet” expressed positively or negatively?

I’m so used to losing money almost immediately following all of my buys. This relative stability has been pleasant.

We gonna moon for real now? What’s the catalyst? Getting so tired of these fake outs

Potential to facilitate micro finance is most compelling

Not sure about Bakkt but Galaxy Digital is weeks away from launching the first institutional lending platform in the blockchain space. Had some discussions with those guys and they’re expecting Bakkt and Fidelity DAS soon.

Why are we mooning?

I’ve been so depressed bag holding this btc with -50% losses that I’ve lost interest in keeping up with the news. Has the implementation of lightning been effective? How sound is the underlying blockchain tech, really? What is the likelihood bitcoin loses relevance? 
@_date: 2019-01-08 00:16:10
True I should have highlighted depression stage. I think we’re still there with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-01-26 13:10:19
Proud to have invested $100k USD in bitcoin despite my 40% losses. Call me delusional, but watching all of this manipulation in the stock market likely driven by the big banks and fed has made me appreciate a SOV vehicle that has limited supply and no centralized authority. We hear this all the time, but it’s the simple reality of what bitcoin is and represents that gives me hope for this world’s future.

If bitcoin become the de facto currency in a country, couldn’t that government regulate it simply by tracking IP addresses while monitoring the blockchain?

Looked like an inverse head and shoulders which always looks like a fat dong when these TA guys on YouTube draw it out
