Have you tried another computer/internet connection? Might be worth trying another browser as well??
@_date: 2018-01-01 05:26:50
Yeah I understand that. But is the $10,000 based on when you initially bought the bitcoin, or based the product are you buying?
 They really need to say “provided the cost of the PRODUCT or SERVICE you are buying is under $10,000”  if that’s what they mean.  The way they word it seems like they are referring to when we buy the bitcoin. We don’t buy bitcoin when we buy a product, we’re spending it. 
If I bought $9,999 with of bitcoin and it went up to a value of $1,000,000, it sounds to me like we don’t have to pay CGT tax providing we spend the bitcoin and don’t convert it to fiat. 
True?? Does that make sense or am I tripping?? It’s in black and white on their site
@_date: 2019-07-20 20:46:08
I’ve always wondered if we could somehow mine Bitcoins by using the power created when we press the brakes on our combustion driven cars
@_date: 2018-01-19 09:57:42
I truly believe they are just under stress at the moment.
I’ve been depositing to Coinjar over the last 6 months and haven’t had one issue. I have not withdrawn and money so I can’t comment on withdrawals. I can’t complain about Coinspot either, although I have only deposited bitcoin to them.
I suggest maybe trying to hit them up on Facebook. They seem to be following up on comments on you post there.
@_date: 2019-07-11 13:20:25
To track people’s spending. Why else would they do it?
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:41:53
I’ve been wondering this for a long time.
Is the $10,000 limit the maximum amount of bitcoins you can initially buy, or the maximum cost of the goods or service you are buying?
You can read it 2 different ways.
They say “provided the COST of the Bitcoin is under $10,000”. They don’t say “provided the cost of the PRODUCT or SERVICE is under $10,000”
So I would assume that if I bought $9990 worth of Bitcoin and it went to $1,000,000 in 3 years time, I don’t have to pay any tax provided I spend the bitcoin on items directly from my Bitcoin wallet?
Obviously if I cash out anything to fiat, or pay for an item that is asking for AUD (eg: Living Room if Satoshi services) it’s would be taxable. 
That’s what it sounds like to me! How do you guys read it?
From the ATO website:
Where you use bitcoin to purchase goods or services for personal use or consumption, any capital gain or loss from disposal of the bitcoin will be disregarded (as a personal use asset) provided the cost of the bitcoin is $10,000 or less.

Providing it’s not illegal, i think it will always have value now.  Too many different people own it now, purely for investment purposes. Selling will pick up just before people start to cash out at $100,000. I believe it will keep going possibly up to $200,000, but only god knows where it will finish.
Now, if there’s big problems with North Korea, I believe Bitcoin will take off again big time. People will panic and a lot will get out of property and buy bitcoin. If you think about it, bitcoin would be the best form of value due to the ease of moving it around with you. If Financial banks broke down it would be the safest and only thing you’d want to own. Even gold would be too hard to move around. 
I hope that never happens though.
In saying all this, don’t sell. Still got a long way to go I think

Very true 
@_date: 2018-09-16 15:32:35
Worse case scenario? Developers/miners not embracing enhancements in the technology to improve it.
Best scenario for Bitcoin? Banks jumping on board and providing secure wallets/storage for customers.  This would be an absolute game changer if they just woke up to themselves.
As much as I’d hate them to get them involved, they’d have to have rocks in their head to not start providing Bitcoin services. 
I truly believe this will create the next big crypto boom.
Sony killed Napster and Apple took over the whole industry taking a huge cut out of their market. Those silly dick heads at major labels gave it away to Apple by trying to fight the technology rather than embrace it. It was one of the worse business decisions in history imo.
I think eventually banks won’t be left with any other option but to provide their customers with a Bitcoin account as part of their service. This is when Bitcoin will thrive.

Yep, this is so true. Over trading can be someone’s worst enemy.
I believe back testing trades and finding significant resistance and support levels is everything in my opinion. Always wait for those signals to happen before rushing into a trade, don’t try to find and alternative trade plan just so you can keep trading. 
Find what works and stick to it, as boring as it may seem.

Exactly. Only time heals the wounds of investors. This takes around 5-7 years from my experience. When that time comes those investors would have saved more money, their crypto holdings have recovered then they end up buying more and then others start to jump on board.

Because it has one characteristic of how a ponzi works. It involves value and relying on someone else to pay a higher price for it before the price will rise.
They usually stop there and don’t want to learn anything else about it.

I really hope bitcoin and crypto in general go up again quickly. Everyone does. But the facts are, who ever was going to get into Bitcoin did. And most lost or missing out on great profits due to greed. It’s going to take time for people to make that money back before they have another try (That’s if they dare to give it another go). It’ll be very hard to find new investors.
We are in uncharted waters. This has never happened before in crypto. MtGox saga was nothing compared to this, I don’t care what anyone says. We had one company controlling everything and it was only Bitcoin. Alts didn’t exists.
It’s a long ride. I believe bitcoin will fall to at least $5000 before we see a decent rebound. It will never be anything like it was in Nov 2017 so make sure you keep your day jobs.
I’m excited to see what the blockchain can do for the real world more than anything. We’re going to see some amazing things from these ICO’s. I believe we’ll have many companies as big as Facebook born out of it.

I totally agree. It will be disgusting to watch but I think we have to go through the pain and torture.
Bitcoin has proven that it will always be the gold of crypto. Luckily that’s one thing that should never change. 
I just hope it remains as a store of value rather than a form of payment. I believe payments made daily will kill the price, then it will never recover.

The smaller the world gets, the more Bitcoin will be required
Take a trip overseas. When you need to convert currency from one to another you’ll realise why bitcoin is required.

Throw 10% into it, but that is all. Don’t ever go all in on crypto, especially with you grans money. It’s disrespectful
@_date: 2019-01-17 10:59:49
If you’re wondering if it’s too risky, you’re not ready for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-16 12:35:14
I have to say, I believe it. Bitcoin is in a different market to what it was before. It was manipulated one way, up. Now it can be manipulated in the opposite direction as well. 
I still believe Bitcoin could make it to over $100,000 some day, but it will be mainly due to minimal supply (from large amounts being lost, hacks etc).
It’ll be a rocky road getting there. The so called cartels now have it by the balls in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-11-28 11:16:58
Good for you
All I got was an amazing rush in 2017 and then a headache in 2018. I’m guessing 2019 might be a bit of both 
@_date: 2019-01-13 01:56:03
Fundamentals = Big scary military more like it. 
Take the military might away and the dollar will fall. Why do you think Trump is withdrawing troops? It’s the perfect way to bring to dollar value down to create jobs and stimulate the economy. It’ll probably do great things for Wall st as well.
@_date: 2018-03-26 12:19:27
Back in 2012 (when it was $8) people laughed when I said it could be worth over $1000 in 4 years time. Then when it made it to that I said it will probably rebound and make it to $10,000 in 4 years time. 
Moral of the story. I was wrong every time and undervalued the price and the time it took to get there.
I have no doubt it will make it to $100,000 within the next 2-3 years. Big money is in Bitcoin now, those holders won’t sell in a hurry.
By 2025 we could possibly see $300-$400k. Sounds ridiculous, but so were my original predictions.
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:42:40
It was mainly pushed up due to Ethereum and ICO tokens. Without Ethereum the price of Bitcoin wouldn’t have gone up as high as it did. As we know you need to buy Bitcoin and Ethereum to be able to swap it for an ICO.
I think Tether, whales holding, bullshit volumes on dodgy exchanges things like that stopped Bitcoin from crashing for many years during the pre-ICO days.
So yeah, it will always be manipulated in some way, especially while it’s not regulated. The big boys are having a ball with it now. They can break any moral rules and not go to jail over it. Why wouldn’t they do it, they finally have liquidity in the market to push huge amounts of money around.
How do you think the price made it to $19,000?Curious to know!
Oh and I said it would make it to $100,000, I highly doubt it would stay there though.
@_date: 2019-01-13 01:44:33
Easily? Not really. I wouldn’t say losing 8% of it during a currency conversion a good thing. Especially when the dude behind the desk worked for 1 minuet to get it. Absolute robbery and totally unnecessary, especially in first world countries. Even getting charge on your credit cards for conversions is a total scam. It’s just digits on a screen for crying out loud.
I travelled recently and lost a lot of money in fees from having to switch cash currencies, it was a joke. Wouldn’t have that problem if everyone accepted Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:39:28
lol this made my day.
@_date: 2018-11-22 10:37:18
I’m not an accountant, but I’ll try to help.
I’d say if you were paid in Bitcoin, then you only need to pay capital gains tax on the amount that it increased in price “after the date you received each amount”. You’d need to work that out yourself, somehow.
As for all the other ones you bought you’ll need to figure out the dates you bought them and add or deduct the capital gains/losses.
It’s a messy situation. You might just have to average it out as much as you can. Might be your only option for doing your tax this time.
In future, probably best to just spend the coins as you get paid with them. If you do that, I’m pretty sure the gains aren’t taxable. But remember, if you do this I’m pretty sure you can’t claim them as losses either if the price goes down.
Bitcoin is either classed as an investment or a form of payment. 2 different scenarios.
Maybe someone can clarify. Correct me if I’m wrong.
@_date: 2018-03-26 21:11:39
You are absolutely correct. But as the graph and statistics show, there is more chance that it will go up than go down.
The only thing that has changed is the fact you can now short bitcoin on the markets. In my opinion that might be the only thing that slows down the process. Supply of coins will only ever dwindle away due to people holding or from the coins being lost. This will act like coin burning, which will raise the price even more in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-03-31 21:15:24
I believe it has. It was only a matter of time before it happened.
@_date: 2019-01-12 17:33:32
Just they can have a chance to short it even more  than they already are. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 23:47:18
They already control it, by law. They could ban it tomorrow if they wanted to.
@_date: 2018-03-30 07:15:57
I hope you like eating rice, because that’s what you could be eating for the next 6 months.

It will never die, but there’s always I chance it could be made illegal.
That’s the only thing that could kill bitcoin

It’s going sideways for at least 1 year fellas. Load up the paper wallets and come back next year.
I hope I’m wrong, but history says it could be 2 years before we see another all time high.

Exactly. So they should. It’s like giving chocolate to a dog and wondering why it died.

Yep, it’s an alt. You’ll find a lot of people trying to trick people into thinking it’s the real Bitcoin but this is rubbish. Do your own research.
Bitcoin is Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash is an alt coin. It’s as simple as that

Ok thanks. Yeah I’m not sure what it was, but I was surprised to see IP address attached to transactions. So are all transactions IP free these days?
@_date: 2018-07-21 06:25:12
Stay away from ICO’s and tokens
@_date: 2019-09-23 22:00:50
It was back in 2012 when I first looked into Bitcoin. IP addresses were always visible with each transaction. If I remember correctly, it was all on the Blockchain.info block explorer
@_date: 2018-07-22 01:55:32
Coinomi is the best app in my opinion

And the government will be left with the Bitcoin that no one wants to use. Society will move onto the next coin. It’s a no win situation for the gov
Governments need to embrace it, tax it, or miss out. It’s as simple as that
@_date: 2018-07-05 10:54:17
At this point in time crypto is a great way of protecting your wealth from bad actions of certain governments.  It’s the only world standard vale that I know of that can be transferred within minutes and be worth the same amount when it reaches the other side (other than the obvious price fluctuations)
Yes crypto is backed by cryptography, but it’s still just digits on a screen as well. Always remember that.
It will find its place and value over time. Unfortunately, at the moment we still need fiat. I hate to say it but it works much better than crypto as a currency.
@_date: 2018-07-20 02:22:50
Yeah and there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq as well. Don’t believe everything you read.

Back in the early days I remember ip addresses were all visible for each transaction. Anyone know what happened to this?
@_date: 2018-04-03 10:23:09
You think it’s hard now, back in 2012 it was much harder. Just trying store them probably was difficult.
But, if it was easy everyone would have been doing it. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 12:52:52
Then technically that makes Bitcoin centralised in a way. Mathematics doesn’t involve insurance backing it when things go wrong. That’s the whole point of crypto, not having insurance. That’s it’s value 
@_date: 2018-04-18 21:46:44
Can you imagine it in 10 years from now? What a joke. Forks will end up destroying crypto

I’ve tried to use Bitpay before, it’s a piece of shit. QR scan usually doesn’t work and it turns into a situation when I end up just paying with fiat in the end.

You’re getting a girlfriend and a prostitute mixed up. Girlfriends cost more than 10 BTC. Go the prostitute option, less hassle

Only sell if you are in debt over it. If you can hold onto them without giving you too much stress then do that.
And by the way, 12 Bitcoins is a lot of Bitcoin for anyone.
