Its not racism to say you wont deal with a company from a specific country because their gouverment is pretty corrupt.. get down from your high horse mate. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 13:17:33

What is the point of BTC then lol? It there also is a conversion fee is makes eves less sense.. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 09:36:47
I never said that.. but you said you never heard anyone work for free.. and I asked if you never heard about volunteer work. Has nothing to do with the article..

Jeffrey is a piece of shit if you ask me. He is not making anything happen unless he gets richer in the process. 
Edit: Seems people are downvoting because im calling Jeffrey a piece of shit.. I am not doing that because he is supporting bitcoin. But because he done a lifetime of shady things towards the American people.. but I guess you guys support anyone who support bitcoin no matter how big of a shit they are..

Did you even read the Starbucks news? It will be in the end of 2018 and they wont accept Bitcoin really. They will take it and convert it to fiat  So if you use bitcoin to pay there may be a extra fee.. Not really great for btc..

I like having a bank.. they help with investing my money (for free) and in my country the state will guarantee your money if the bank for some reason should go bankrupt... And when I have to buy a house the bank will lend me they money I need to make such an investment.. how is BTC going to do all that for me? We need banks.. 
@_date: 2018-10-23 10:53:50
&lt;Only in America&gt; remember that. 
@_date: 2018-10-18 12:51:25
Damn what a shitty clickbait article
@_date: 2018-10-09 14:49:48
Aaaaand? What is the point of this post? 
@_date: 2018-06-24 10:20:09
So you only want positive posts? Well that sure sounds like freedom of speech..
@_date: 2018-06-25 10:55:52

Is this a investment or a currency? Make up your damn mind reddit..

If people actually knew what "Federel Reserve Notes" are the survey would be way different.. If he wrote "Dollars" instead of Federel Reserve notes the results would have been way different.. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 14:15:21
I thought BTC was a currency not a investment like regular stocks.. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 13:15:54
Same here. Seems a lot more unhandy than paying with card or mobile which is instant and 1 swipe. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 18:13:28
I print work emails all the time ��

What makes you so sure that Bitcoin will exist in 10 years? 
@_date: 2018-07-17 15:22:19
Wtf?? 5.2% just to withdraw my money?? 
@_date: 2018-07-19 22:53:38
c'mon dude. You can short every company, every ressource and pretty much everything tradeable. Ofc you should be able to short Bitcoin as well. And if people dident do it, the price would not increase as much as today for instance. For people to make money, other people has to loose money most of the time in trading.
@_date: 2018-07-24 16:18:39
You say something and the next thing you say counters the first thing. Gz on trying so hard you actually look stupid. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 15:41:01
Made up? Wow.. You must really be drinking that BTC koolaide all day long to think that the Euro or the Dollar is "made up". 
@_date: 2018-12-02 14:30:04
Not trying to be that guy.. But what is the benefit of this? I mean I can send money through my bank for free..
