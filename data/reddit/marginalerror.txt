I do not pay for porn because it's easily accessible for free and because porn sites are shady as shit and I don't trust them with my credit info, along the same lines of the automatic renewal. Bitcoin really will help porn for all the reasons you listed and will be the foremost early adapters. Average Joe (me) will not pay for porn; average Joe finds out he can pay for a single day or hour of high quality porn fairly anonymously and he might do it every once in a while.

First time watching his full podcast. Rogan was definitely more receptive than the goon on the computer. Goon claimed 3 people were recently arrested due to Bitcoin even though the first article he pulled up was about the same guy from the second article.
Then again the best discussions include a believer and a nonbeliever so goon was ok. Very good show

Already done. Doesn't really mean much though, actually I've put more cash into Bitcoin than I ever have into savings. I'm a fairly young guy and never have put much into retirement/savings. If Bitcoin never goes up another dollar I'll still have saved more than I ever have in my life and if it crashes I'll just be back where I started.

Spewing forth their color
he purposely waited till I was done
to knock on the lavatory door 
accusing me of ruining the fun
he knocked on it some more
The fun, He knocked on it some more
Alloyed suitors drawn inside
an apple or a grape
To put forth a cloud of mercury 
he was run over by a car
on a freeway in Los Angeles 
once the spraying has been done
'Cause there's more pain from necessity
you're a portrait of your past
There's a mummy in the cabinet
Are there no more arrows left?
What's that rubber bottle doing here? 
How's that napkin for a proof?

Mainstream adoption is going to happen with $ not Bitcoin denominations. Mainstream adoption requires infrastructure and ease of access. The underlying technical aspects of Bitcoin is what will propel it into the mainstream not it's denomination. 
Easy to use platforms and wallets for the mainstream will display the users $ equivalent in big bold letters and the actual amount of Bitcoin in small text beneath. No coffee shop is going to ask you to pay them 0.00032 BTC or 0.32 mBTC, they will say "that will be $3" and you will pull out your phone and pay in Bitcoin. 
Denominations of Bitcoin has nothing to do with mainstream adoption, you're going to confuse the shit out of people that are barely starting to understand what Bitcoin is.
Sometimes Bitcoiners are so smart that they're dumb. Please leave it to professional developers to dumb Bitcoin down for the general public.

You will receive the exact amount of coin you ordered, so it will appreciate in value. You're not going to be able to wire money into an exchange any faster, at least Coinbase holds the coins for you while the transfer processes. Once your first transaction goes through with Coinbase it's all smooth sailing and you can process more than one transaction at a time. They do this for their own safety and yours. You won't get coin faster unless you want to pay a large markup on Localbitcoins. Coinbase is a great service and there is no reason to trash talk because you don't have patience. 
If you don't have patience you probably shouldn't be getting into Bitcoin. Calm down sir

You've got my upvote. The big talkers here are anti everything. Many lurkers here have a more realistic view on life though and are maybe afraid to post for that reason.
Nothing against Anarchistic or Libertarian viewpoints, Bitcoin was built on these ideas and I support these ideas. Bitcoin will still retain most of those values but Bitcoin is leaving the nest. It's time for Bitcoin to attempt to go mainstream. It is growing beyond the control of its original user base. Unfortunately It's time to support Bitcoin for it's "pseudolibertarian" utility. It's still a huge win if it succeeds.
Short term value requires fair, and I do stress fair, regulation at this point in time. It's not going to hit "the moon" this year without fair regulation.

You're not at all necessarily wrong, early adopters may very well be dumping coins which is good for everyone. The influx of new users far exceeds the amount of early adopters cashing out.

Bitcoin started out as "drug money". The fact that we have moved to gambling and porn is a big step in the right direction, these are at least legal. Just give it time. You're too focused on the end results and not the path that leads there. Right now the path is porn and gambling as much as you may not like it

Bitcoin sales as of now may only account for 1.3% of their total sales but really they have boosted their sales by 1.3%. Instead of making 100% profit this month they are making 101.3% profit, the math checks out.

It's really pretty simple. You purchase say 0.5 Bitcoin. That half a coin is yours in your own personal wallet. The value of that coin is what anyone is willing to pay for it. There is a limited supply of these coins. You can hold your 0.5 coin, you can spend it, you can sell it or you can send it to your friend in Germany in a matter of minutes.

Yes I do understand that no regulations would be nice, we could all open our own exchanges tomorrow if there weren't. The "Bruce Fenton Exchange" could compete with the "Marginal Error Brokers" and yours would put mine out of business based on our names.
Though we are Americans living in America and we do have regulations. We can strive for fewer regulations but in the end we live in American reality and that won't happen. I'm not arguing for strict guidelines on cryptocurrencies, but some regulatory guidelines based on already existing law might let you open that Bruce Fenton Exchange tomorrow

I think we can all agree that Charlie was not the best panelist yesterday. I also think we can agree that Bitcoin does not need regulation to survive. Although one of the best samples from yesterdays panel was that no U.S. exchange exist due to a lack of regulatory guidelines. We do need some guidelines for businesses to operate in the U.S.

I'm not entirely sure what you're getting at. If regulators take a favorable view of Bitcoin and it flourishes it will be to big to take down later, but yes they could regulate it tighter down the road

Not sure if this is your problem but I do know that a common mistake is trying to withdraw .583 Bitcoin rather than 0.583 Bitcoin. Best thing to do is message support, they can help you better than we can

I argue that an entity that is worth billions is worth something to someone. I argue that I have spent my Bitcoin on countless things even though my coins will potentially go up in value. I argue that Bitcoin is an incredible payment platform that I use irregardless of monetary value.

rumplefistbump is right that everyone should do their own research but how will they know that if someone doesn't tell them? Bitcoin is a savvy technology and you're turning people off by not clearly explaining that and pointing people in the right direction. The goal is to get the common people involved right, and you're exactly helping by saying figure it out on your own. Common people are not necessarily tech savvy and you're turning them off by telling them to figure it out on their own. As far as bitcoin goes it's not as easy to figure out as tying you're shoes
@_date: 2013-12-19 06:33:57
Coinbase is reliable aside from some random issues that people seem to have with them, they haven't robbed my bank account. If you're that worried, which is understandable, do like you said and create a bank account just for Bitcoin transaction. Coinbase is a legitimate business though

I feel that this thread has mostly just proven my point. All the posts saying "I don't want to answer the same question" or "it's hard not to be an ass" end up at the top of the thread. In order for Bitcoin to go mainstream we need to get the "stupid" "uneducated" "lazy" people involved with Bitcoin.

I was actually thinking about this a couple days ago. I was thinking to leave instructions to access my Bitcoin fortune (I would call it a fortune no matter what the amount) to my closest loved one. Since it's currently my brother I would probably format it in the form of a treasure map, especially since it's a "fortune". 
Bitcoins do get lost and many have already, that's how it works. In your distant scenario an altcoin would take over.
@_date: 2013-12-16 09:24:23
First we didn't experience a "crash", we're at 800+ if you think we crashed you're as new as anyone. People should at least have the courtesy to point them in the right direction. In the end it benefits everyone, don't turn people off of bitcoin by ignoring them

Already some of the people on this thread are the problem that I'm talking about. Too many inconsiderate assholes unwilling to give help to the new gen; enough of an ass to go out of their way to say "why would I give help if I've given the answer before". I don't get it, I had hoped the bitcoin community was more friendly rather than greedy, getting new and especially inexperienced people involved is the key to this whole thing don't you get it?
@_date: 2013-12-16 10:20:55
1240 to 550 could definitely be considered a crash but considering it jumped from below that and it all happened in less than a month I dunno. Bitcoin as far as I can tell doesn't really crash unless you're a stupid day trader. Which I feel should be discouraged but whatever.

Because it always does. I would also bet that that it's not a coincidence that it happened the day after Christmas; more money to spend and from the looks of it a lot of people were made aware of Bitcoin on Christmas

I've seen plenty of new questions go unanswered. Nobody can even say &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;look to the right? I guess I'll make that my job. It benefits everyone to make the new community feel involved instead of feeling like an outsider. The bitcoin community is not as friendly and inviting as I wish they would be

Because it's always good in the long run?

Purchase them through coinbase or localbitcoins. You can also use exchanges like mtgox or btc-e but that takes more time. You can sell through coinbase as well. If you don't link a bank account selling becomes harder

I very much doubt that you confirmed then immediately canceled on the pop-up, who does that? I bought coins over the weekend at 850 like you did, just suck it up and wait for the rise. As others have stated new players like you are probably the reason we have trouble with coinbase, very unfortunate

First learned of it when I learned of Deep Web and Silk Road. Mistook it as an easy way to get drug money from one point to the other, I really really missed the big picture at the time. Was $5 back then and feel foolish for not getting involved, at least from a monetary standpoint. Now I'm involved and hope the best for Bitcoin even if it doesn't end with monetary gain. Hope it does though, can't lie
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:56:04
Should probably wait another day or two and see if we're at the bottom. I also bought in at over $1000, wish I had some extra cash to convert to coin right about now
