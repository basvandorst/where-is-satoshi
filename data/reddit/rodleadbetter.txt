I lost $271.00 from my blockchain.info and I know it hurts, it sucks and although I keep hearing it's a lesson learned, I feel that this theft should be taken more seriously than hearing "lesson learned"  I would like it if all the people that have lost Bitcoin from a recent scam should band together to prevent this as it should be considered serious.  I found A site that locates info on location/s, if you can provide tx details.  I just don't know where to go from there and there isn't anyone supportive as to assure if this is "just suck it up" or "do something about it.  It's a lonely violation and when you don't have much to invest, you lose out on current trades because we were depending on the Bitcoin we paid for.  I hear ya and I'm sorry it happened to you too!

I would like to be able to retrieve my Anoncoins I withdrew from a safe online exchange to my desktop Anoncoin wallet, that doesnt reveal its balance.  I'm not getting help anywhere else,so how can this idea be so bad if done with all the correct transaction information.  3rd day and still trying, but ppl just give obvious answers without believing that there could be some software glitch.  Yes, please create a protocol!

They took me!  271.00 worth and I never in my life thought it would happen.  I'm still upset over it!  I don't understand how it takes so long for me to transfer and it took 10 seconds for them to steal it? Very Phishy to me.
