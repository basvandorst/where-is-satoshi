I think it was all leaked about a year ago IIRC.

Where's the best place to generate wallet QR Codes to paste there?

Hey I created an interactive version of this wallet design, so that you can just punch in your hashes and have the QRCodes generated and overlayed right on top.
Hope you or anyone else can find it useful!

I ate at one of these in Seoul just a couple of weeks ago. Delicious!

All I could think about was O'Reilly while reading this.

Imagine this comment from an everyday person, ten years in the future. It sounds very reasonable. This is a true problem that bitcoins are solving.
The volatility of the last few weeks would be too much stress for me, personally, to continue using it as my main store of money. The idea of my cost of living (bills, groceries, etc..) adjusting throughout the day at the whim of the exchange price... "These groceries would have been $50 cheaper if I just went shopping at 4am!!! Why!!!!", could be very frustrating.
That's just today though and truth be told if the growth is reasonably steady over the next few years, who knows, you may be evening those dips out more regularly than not.

I really liked this design, posted by here last week: 
So, I've setup a web page that you can take offline (all the processing is done in Javascript, and client-side) and use to print your QR codes and address in the right positions.
Here's a preview image:
Let me know what you think!

You're not crazy. I see your argument, not today. Someone needs to sell it to them in a nice package, ala "CoinBase Mexico", and explain to them how easy it is to use for this purpose.
Or hell, just tell Local Bitcoins to start an ad campaign down there.
They're saying that this market exists and I for one believe they're right.

I would appreciate if they changed this.
