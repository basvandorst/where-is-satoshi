Alternatively, if one account creates a large number of really small BTC orders for the same price (or within 1 dollar of each other) then it groups them all together into one order using the average number of dollars for the price.
eg 50 orders of 0.01 BTC at $95 + 50 orders of 0.01 BTC at $96 = a 1BTC order at $95.5

I'm getting sick of these "Oh it's the government!" posts.
It's people wanting to make a profit, pure and simple.

Another way of earning Bitcoins is creating a site listing all the places that give away free Bitcoin and use referral links wherever possible...

Pretty much this. Barclays have closed UK based accounts associated with several exchanges because they did not feel the exchanges were doing enough to comply with existing financial legislation (Which believe it or not takes Bitcoin or rather "Cyber Currency" into account already)
To operate a successful UK exchange it has to be a registered UK business or an arm of an international business with a physical office in the UK and paying all associated corporation taxes. Be registered with HMRC as a "Money Service Business" unless the turnover is more than £3 million a month in which case they need to be registered with the Financial Services Authority. Pay VAT on exchange activity (HMRC deem Bitcoin as Cyber Currency and the VAT regime is the same as a Voucher. I cannot find any solid rates but Mike of Bitcoin Fridge claims it is 10%), follow money laundering regulations such as verifying the identity of each customer and keeping copies of their information safe and finally, be registered with the Information Commissioners Office.
However you're free to exchange any currency so long as your annual turnover is less than £64,000. If you hit that figure and you cannot provide an adequate explanation, business plan, roadmap or desire to follow any of the legislation listed above the bank will simply close your account.
None of the previous exchanges paid tax (only Bitcoin Fridge does) but my guesses for account seizures are: Intersango and Blockchain didn't follow Money Laundering Regulations (Only needed a text to verify identity whereas regulations need proof of address and photographic ID) and MtGox probably got stung on the FSA requirement.
So none of the financial institutions in the UK are "Anti-Bitcoin" they just want to make sure that we're providing ways to trace fiat back to the trader if any investigation requires it. The biggest hurdle that any UK exchange startup faces is the 10% tax but who knows, in the future HMRC may change their stance on that.
Note: this does not apply to businesses simply accepting Bitcoin as payment for goods and services, in that case the Bitcoin transaction is treated as a voucher and is perfectly legal although as mentioned above the business owner still has to pay VAT on that sale)
