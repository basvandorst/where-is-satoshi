How is actual evidence about the contents of the top 500 addresses "zero evidence"?


And that claim would not be "completely baseless" either, if you're basing it on *evidence that exists about Bitcoin ownership* and the *fact* that people have multiple addresses.

If Bitcoin ever picked up to a significant level of use, WU would simply add it as a payment option. Till then, there's no reason at all for something most people use for remittance (WU) to publicize something virtually nobody uses for anything (Bitcoin).

I'd definitely remit money via irreversible and untraceable transactions to Anonymous People On Teh Internets claiming to be "Remittance Offices", rather than via WU, which clearly has all the hallmarks of some fly-by-night outfit.
BTW, I just went to WU now, and filled out the form to send £97 to Nepal. With a fee for Instant Cash it came to £99.90, with the receiver getting 15290 NPR, which is ~£95 according to Google.
Unless I'm missing something, that amounts to ~5% for WU to deliver *instant local cash* to someone. Good luck running offices on every corner of the world charging less than that.

Yeah, you can tell Bitcoin is not about Satoshi, based on the fact that nobody ever calls fractions of Bitcoin 'Satoshis', the most infamous place to waste Bitcoins (aside from Mt Gox) was not called SatoshiDice, nobody is ever directed to read Satoshi's "White Paper", and nobody writes endless forum, blog and magazine articles speculating on Satoshi's identity.

Seriously, why do some people expect *everyone else* to be into the same things they are? Imagine someone droning on and on about, for example, Litecoin.
Particularly when you know the *only reason* - the **only** reason - they are trying to get you into it, is to *benefit themselves*.
If you're not into something, having someone bore the living shit out of you with it, because it stands to benefit *them*, isn't going to change your mind. Quite the opposite.
Maybe people just don't like the idea of paying ~~$400~~ any sum of their hard earned money on something they *don't actually need*, especially from people who got to own most of it at relatively no cost and want to cash out.

The people behind Rebit seem to spam this sub every day with bullshit. Even their own website was [full of false info and made up fees about their own and other services](
It's funny that the OP pulled "10%" out of his ass, because that just happens to be the imaginary figure Godfreee always seems to use when inventing what other remittance services charge.
I just went to Paypal now and chose 10,000 PHP as a test. The fee was 50 PHP, meaning the total is 10,050.
Paypal seems to use 42.99 PHP to $1, putting that at about $233. Since $233 USD on Google is 10,440 PHP, I make that a fee of 4.4%, compared to Rebit's 1%, which of course ignores the cost of acquiring Bitcoins.
Nowhere near a 10% difference, just more fictional noise about Rebit.

1. You must not read this sub very often. :) I think anyone potentially interested in remittance would know the words "Western Union".
2. The ad should state that then. People love apps.
3. The point of limited time promos is to call people to action. If a 'promo' is indefinite, I can just wait till if and when I have time, which may end up being never.
4. How can I not care if I don't know what the fees are? "Nearly $0" could be $10 for all I know. "5 cents" does tell me. 
5. So say "5 cent fee as standard" or something.
6. Bitcoin really does have limits - 7 transactions per second, for one.

Okay. I don't think any sane person expects you to be competing in transaction volume against WU, BTW, or even some of the smaller remittance services that are long established. So even if the numbers are not huge, it's not going to be a big deal (I'd be surprised if they were huge sums, so far).

You're paying for the convenience of being able to retrieve your own money on every street corner, wherever you are. There's zero fee if you be your own bank and keep your money under a mattress, returning home every time you need to buy something, and zero fee if you pretend your money is bitcoin and don't withdraw it from an ATM.


Or as people who aren't weird and dysfunctional call it: money.

OP got his money out, except for a few pennies. Here's what happened, since his bullshit "frozen my assets" headline makes it seem like Barclay's stole his entire life savings:
Last week he discovered his bank account was under some "random review", presumably for transactions and other activity that was occurring on his account. 
Despite being repeatedly told by bank staff this was normal and there was nothing to worry about, and despite being totally innocent of anything shady, his paranoia took hold and he went to a Barclays branch to fearfully *withdraw all his money*. 
Despite it being Saturday, with less staff on than usual, the friendly, helpful bank staff **gave him all his money.** (Except a "few pence".)
Only *after* he not at all suspiciously withdrew all of his money in response to being told his banking activity was under review, was his account closed.
I don't see anything (other than his paranoid assumption) to suggest that they would have closed his account if he hadn't withdrawn all of his money after being told his account was under review.

Having to use Windows as a consequence of Microsoft's unfair domination of the market, *that was so egregiously anti-competitive the DOJ and 20 states had to step in*, is not happily and freely "buying what suits their needs", it's simply buying what they're forced to buy.
And for most people not already hooked on Windows, there is no choice but Windows because, as you pointed out, practically all PC vendors do not sell Linux PCs.
Again: *where Microsoft has not been able to restrict consumer choice*, and *where all vendors fairly provide Microsoft, Apple and Linux options to consumers* - ie, the mobile market - the vast majority of people do not choose Windows.

You have *got* to be trolling. 
WHO CARES what you claim you charge? Do I care about who gets what at WU? No, I care about what I *have to pay*. 
And with Rebit I have to pay at least 5%. Hence, your 1% fee bullshit is willfully misinformative.


Jesus Christ... You were comparing yourselves with WU **cash pickup**. None of your other **cash pickup** options will cost a sender less than 5%, unless someone just happens to be within walking distance of your office.


This is hilarious coming from a service that offers "free" "one hour pickup" at your Makati HQ, an option akin to people across America having to visit an office in Manhattan or people all over Britain visiting the City Of London. 
It's actually no more ludicrous to say you offer free pick up for people in Hong Kong or Singapore or Australia, since all they have to do is go to your Makati office too. Stupid and impractical, right? 
Yet you seem to think Filipinos making a long, expensive, tiresome, sweaty trek to your ivory tower, via plane and/or ferry and/or MRT and/or Jeep and/or taxi, is not only totally reasonable but an actual selling point.
You're the one with zero clue.


Here are *your prices* for cash pickup, according to *your website*, which you still have not demonstrated the slightest familiarity with. Please tell me which number is the lowest.
Palawan Express: **40 PHP** (though you are still falsely claiming it starts at 29 PHP)  
Cebuana Lhuillier: **50 PHP** (though you are still falsely claiming it starts at 30 PHP)

It's almost like this sub *didn't* have to post Dogecoin's rules on responsible tipping, because Bitcoiners are such anti-social spamming fuckheads they were getting banned left right and centre for being twats.
It's exactly because Dogecoin has a positive reputation, that Bitcoin can only dream of, that Bitcoiners are copying Dogecoin wholesale. It wouldn't surprise me if "this is gentlemen" morphed into "hello, this is dog", and the plagiarism of Dogecoin by Bitcoin would be almost total.
People here are increasingly desperate for any shitty idea to save Bitcoin, because they realise nobody who isn't already into Bitcoin gives a single shit about it; that most people who have heard of Bitcoin think it's a ridiculous joke, used by nutters and criminals; and sane people into Bitcoin who can read the flashing neon writing on the wall are pumping and/or cashing out ASAP to idiot HODLer fundamentalists.

"I won't donate them until..."  
"Zero donated"  
"why would I want to donate to Mozilla?!"  
"Fuck that"

Oh dear. First you write off what I said as having "absolutely no merit", rather than allowing for the possibility that you simply weren't getting the point, then when I explain it to you, you cry about taking you out of context, rather than just holding (hodling?) your hands up and admitting you misunderstood.
I replied to your whole post, in context, and then I replied to a single line, specifically. What's the context? That it matters everywhere except when poor people are being suckered into spending hard earned money on them?
Bitcoin price matters when people shit their pants when the price drops. It also matters when it's literally the only thing people have consistently discussed about Bitcoin since it was created. It matters when over 9000 altcoins are created by people who missed the boat on cheap Bitcoins.
However, it doesn't matter when it comes to third world people buying it at a price dictated by the first world? How convenient.
And if it doesn't matter about having a whole Bitcoin - after all poor people can still spend a month's wages on less than half a Bitcoin from a first worlder who paid literally zero for it - why do some people have hundreds of thousands of whole Bitcoins, if not millions?
**TL;DR:** Affluent first world people got Bitcoins for zero or virtually nothing, or, at worst, an affordable if excessive price, due their first world salary compensating for it. Third world people, despite having yearly salaries of $10k or less, should pay the same price, or thousands of times the price as many first worlders did, because in this context, price somehow "doesn't matter".

Recommending someone doesn't download closed source software *because it's closed source* and only download open source *because it's open source* is nothing but ideological horseshit. 
It would not surprise me if most people here have zero experience with open source software, but since Bitcoin is open source (which doesn't stop everyone complaining about altcoins that use its code) every stupid 'pro-open source' thing anyone says is upvoted to the moon.

I came across harsher than I should in my reply but this just seems like you're trotting out some kind of "other people must be thick because they have a different opinion".
Not wanting to defend their opinion doesn't mean they haven't thought about it or considered it. Maybe they don't have the time to analyse and/or explain every single belief they have or maybe they just don't want to. 
And just because someone hasn't thought through every aspect of what they believe doesn't mean it's wrong. How many people bother to think about why the Earth is not flat? They were taught it in school along with a lot of other things, and that's that. 
Does it really matter if you're challenging them about it and they can't remember/give anything to back it up?

I think I said in another post $5, but as an absolute rock-bottom minimum, $1. Less than $1 is literally nothing but an insult, and an encouragement to spam, which everyone hates.
If you seriously want to prevent spamming, as well as a minimum tip amount, limit the amount of posts a person can make in a day *and* within a certain time period.

Thanks for the reply and the point of view. It's far more rational and reasonable to argue that change will happen gradually, over decades, than some people who seem to think change will happen more drastically or sooner. 
While I think there may continue to be uses for Bitcoin if national currencies are 'cryptofied', I don't think it will outcompete them. In fact I don't see any reason why most people would bother with non-national crypto currencies like Bitcoin if 'crypto-fiat' exists, because most people don't care about 'openness' or arguments about inflation/deflation, they simply care about convenience and usefulness.

Comparison page with other remittance services:


You claim it costs 633 PHP to send 1000 PHP, yet when I went to the WU website, the fee to send ~1000 PHP is about 138 PHP, for *instant cash pick up*.
I can't compare this to Rebit, *because you don't even provide such a service*, but WU fees for a bank deposit are ZERO. The closest you get to instant cash is "1 working hour", which means nothing when you're not working, and involves totally impractically visiting your HQ.
Whereas WU appears to state their fees and charges upfront, your comparison page makes no mention of the fact people will be charged for cash pickup at Pawn Shops and charged even more for delivery via courier.
If you're not simply pulling numbers out of your ass, where are you getting 600 PHP from, and why are you falsely stating what people will pay on the send page? For example:
You claim it "starts at" 5-8 PHP to pick up cash from a pawnshop, yet when I select pawnshop the fees are 40-50 PHP. When I check LBC, which you claim "starts at 59 PHP", when the fee is actually 80 PHP.


3:50PM doesn't count as working hours? So that's about 17 hours before you even *begin* to process it? And the "fast" option takes 12 *working* hours?


So Bitcoin is cheaper, so long as you ignore the costs of acquiring Bitcoin, state fees are less than they actually are, and make up fees at other remittance services?


A guide which, unsurprisingly, does not make any mention of the costs involved.
According to their websites:
Cost to send 1000 PHP via WU = 1009.90
Cost to send 1000 PHP via Rebit* = 1010
*Even ignoring the cost to acquire Bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-08-26 14:59:46

Thanks. I just wondered if there was any concrete data out there, because my assumption would be most people had bank accounts. I guess the remittance services have their in-house research though.
90% using MTCs isn't surprising, but doesn't mean they're not depositing to a bank account. According to that survey 70% of of remitters had one. The 2% "internet" is Paypal, maybe.
I would assume that services offering bank deposit indicates a considerable amount of people have accounts, and being zero fee is an incentive in itself to get one. AIUI OFWs are even offered special accounts or rates by some banks.
Anyway, likewise, I'm not shitting all over Bitcoin as the nutjob in the other post said. Bitcoin has a lot of potential, but it's going to do whatever it's going to do regardless of I or almost anyone else posts here.
I don't find it interesting or constructive to just mindlessly lap up any old shit though. And what the OP posted, and what they had on their site, was a lot of BS.

(Edit: this sarcasm is not directed at you, btw; your point is a good one and something I didn't even consider.)
The withdrawal fee for less than 7000 PHP ($156) is 50 PHP ($1.11). By my estimation, for that 50 PHP to push the fees up to 10%, the OP must be paying his "assistant" a "regular salary" of about $20, *and was still making her eat the fees*. Unreal.

Many people here seem to think lots of people were saying - *in the 90s, when Compuserve, AOL and the WWW had made it even more popular* - that the internet, which had already existed for over two decades, would fail.


Usenet, a non-centralised 'anonymous' bulletin board system controlled by no single person, which effectively *was* the internet until the web took off (itself being [announced on Usenet]( by Tim Berners-Lee), crashed in usage when web message boards appeared, despite them being shittier, slower, centralised, less anonymous and moderated.
Why? Because regulation (of spam and trolling in the case of message boards, or scamming, fraud and theft in the case of money) isn't always a bad thing.

I think some people may try it, in addition to Ebay, but for 10% people are getting a marketplace of millions of buyers that won't exist on OB. I also think that, for most people, using a third-party, always-on site is preferable to downloading and running software on their own PC.
And while it's easy to criticise fees and costs we know at Ebay, OB has 'proof of burn' and fees related to disputes, but AFAIK nobody even knows what they will be.
I actually quite like the idea of a marketplace like this, for legit goods, I just think it's of little to no practical use for people selling on Ebay and it's unfortunately inevitable that it will be swamped in illegal material (which will also put off legit sellers).

Dude, Bitcoin is bigger than the wheel, fire, that asteroid that killed all the dinosaurs, and the first time an ape hit another ape with a bone then flung it up in the air and it turned into a space ship.
It's bigger than the Beatles *and* John Lennon as a solo artist. *And Led Zepp.*
It's bigger than Jesus *and* Bitcoin Jesus *and* Jesus from Hill Street Blues.
It's bigger than Alan Turing, Nikola Tesla, Bill Hicks and other people who are even bigger these days than they were when they were alive.
It's bigger than the number you get when you multiply the amount of worthless fiat that Bitcoin is ironically unironically valued in with the number of people who don't have Bitcoins because they're not as intelligent as people with Bitcoins.
We should all die now, having witnessed the birth of the Bitcoin, because from now on everything else in life will be a disappointment.
Anyone who doesn't understand this is insane, because there is no possible way you can exaggerate the importance of Bitcoin. And one day Bitcoin will prove this to us mathematically.

Bitcoin the 'technology' is a stepping stone or building block to something else. Bitcoin the currency will never, ever, *ever* be used by the population at large. Ever. In fact the only people who even care about that happening are those who are desperate to buy a private island with their minuscule holding.
People will eventually use Government crypto, based on national currencies, because it makes no sense at all for any Government or bank to want to use a constantly disappearing currency, mined in Chinese warehouses and almost entirely owned by a handful of people, including over 7% of the total money supply owned by just one unknown individual, when they can simply create their own crypto, controlled, regulated and secured by them.
Bitcoin the 'currency' will be relegated back to obscurity as a token in darknet markets, so the OP will in some way get what he wants.

Not having met someone is irrelevant. I've never met the people who own or run my bank, in fact I couldn't even name them, but I know there's almost no chance I will lose money there because of Government laws, regulations and protections. 
OTOH we have well known Bitcoin legend Mark Karpeles. Everyone knew him, everyone knew where he was based, which is more than you can say for some Bitcoin exchanges, and some people had even met him; and yet lots of people were robbed by him and his site, and AIUI there's no hint of any comebacks for him at all.


And most people do not want to "be their own bank". That's why most people use actual banks, rather than their mattress, and why even in Bitcoinland people use online wallets, for convenience.


But you're happy to deal with "100 pages" of How To Secure Your Bitcoin.


So you expect everyone to go through the ordeal of 'being their own bank' just to make things convenient for you? Right now you and everyone else can pay for things easily. The fact that you are paranoid about banks is not relevant to anyone else, nor should it be.


Sorry to break it to you, but having to be your own bank is an inherent flaw in Bitcoin for most people.

Program and code and give advice/answer questions because you want to *help people*, and because it's good for a community, not because you want to get tips for it.
Tipping ridiculously stupid amounts of internet money might be fun (for you) on or here, but it's at best of no interest to most people, and at worst an insult and makes crypto look like a joke. 
And *tipping will absolutely not take whatever holding you have to the moon.*

Thanks for a better post. I accept that even though I can buy airline tickets and Hustler subscriptions with Dogecoin that Bitcoin has more 'network effect', but the fact is, for all the hype, virtually nobody anywhere uses any crypto, so "switching costs" not even a significant factor for people.
As for fiat, if and when Governments produce crypto versions of their own currency, it's game over. It's a choice for people between money they already have that is already accepted everywhere or something almost nobody uses and almost nobody accepts.
TLDR: "The single biggest advantage" fiat has is the only thing that really matters.

I have some contacts at the NSA so I was able to call in a few favours and get someone there to type "ebay fees" into Google. He managed to unearth this URL hidden at the top of the results:
It's filled with arcane and confusing stuff like "10% FINAL VALUE FEE + PAYPAL FEE" and "Your final value fee is 10% of your total transaction cost (including postage)" and a link to a "fees calculator" which gives 10% as an estimated fee for anything you put into it.
Maybe someone here can decipher all that mumbo-jumbo but I'm just going to assume everything is free on Ebay, and hope I don't get screwed over by hidden fees they didn't mention anywhere, such as in a "Fees" section of a user agreement I accepted when I signed up.

It's funny how the ones who act like other people are less intelligent are themselves too dumb to realise it's not that people don't understand, *they just don't care*. Nor should they. They have social lives and other interests. 
Problem for Bitcoin is that explaining what it does exposes the reality that it doesn't do shit they can't already do a lot more conveniently and with a lot more buyer protection.
The only way Bitcoin is 'better' is if you want to buy illegal goods, or if you think 'decentralisation' is vitally important or even interesting. 
Most people do not want illegal drugs or CP and most people don't care about 'decentralisation', which is why most people aren't interested in Bitcoin as an alternative to what they use now.
Obviously people who've invested their life savings in Bitcoin only to see the price drop like a stone and those who think their 0.01 BTC holding will buy them an island someday will feel compelled to bury this reality.

The 'real internet' won because everyone in the entire world used the real internet, whereas AOL was just some American company that nobody outside the US had even heard of, never mind cared about.


What do you even mean by "closed"? When AOL allowed access to the internet, AOLers continued to use AOL services, because they liked them. AOL services were no more 'closed' than Facebook is, and that appears to be a somewhat popular service.


The services and ideas around fiat money absolutely dwarf anything Bitcoin will ever have, outside the fantasy of Bitcoin taking over the world, and any 'proprietary' (Government) crypto would immediately be usable at every service and business that already exists.


You must not have heard of Windows. Or Office. Or Photoshop. Please look up how the open versions of those have fared.


People use Android because it's relatively cheap and has lots of apps. Nobody (so few as to not matter) cares that it is 'open' (which is debatable anyway).


And, again, nobody (so few as to not matter) cares, because it doesn't matter. What matters is that every service and every product that currently works with fiat will work with crypto-fiat. Every business will accept it. Every person will be able to use it, and without having to 'be their own bank' too (something else there is zero demand for among real people).
If and when Governments create a crypto version of national currency, however poor you may think it is, it's game over, because that is what everyone will be using.

And that claim would not be "completely baseless" either, **if you're basing it on evidence that exists about Bitcoin ownership** and the fact that people have multiple addresses.

How is there "no exclusion" if I need a working internet connection ("middle man")? Whereas even without an internet connection, I can transfer money using my bank, at will, using a telephone. 
99.9% of people don't care how their money gets from A to B, just that it does so safely and securely. And Bitcoin is less safe, less secure and less convenient than the banking system. Make a mistake with a banking transaction and you may end up paying a fee; make a mistake with Bitcoin and you are SOL, as many people have found to their enormous cost.
As to credit checks, it's pretty easy to not bother when you're not providing any financial services. Bitcoin is a currency. Banks are not. Good luck running any kind of Bitcoin lending service, for example, without bothering to check who you're lending to.
Bitcoin services require personal info, IDs and, in some cases reported here, selfies holding an ID. OTOH, I've set up more than one bank account *at banks I did not already have a relationship with* in about half an hour over the phone. Obviously they carried out some checks, but I didn't have to enter a branch or show any physical ID.
Since most people are not trying to launder money or evade tax, most people don't have a problem with providing their name or address; something that has to be done any time you want something delivered to or installed at your home anyway, such as an internet connection that makes Bitcoin usable.
If you're not prepared to give out your name and address to anyone, the legal things you can do with Bitcoin, and where you can do it from, are seriously restricted. Contrived and exclusionary you could say.

No, I'm saying that Governments *don't always* go in the direction of restricting personal freedoms, which is what you claimed, and there's an example.
What you're saying, however, is "despite being given an example of Governments moving away from restricting personal freedoms I still say they always restrict personal freedoms, because other stuff". 


They're not legislating that being gay is right or is a right, they're repealing legislation that says otherwise.

If Satoshi had used text from Razzle, would that make the January 2009 edition of a wank mag a "historical artifact"? This edition of The Times, of which tens of thousands may exist in lofts and up and down the UK, is nothing but a curiosity. It doesn't announce Bitcoin; it doesn't reference Bitcoin; *it has nothing at all to do with Bitcoin*. It simply contains a line of text that Satoshi happened to use in something so obscure that even some people in this very thread were unaware of it.
If some people were willing to pay $1000+ for something that was $10 just months earlier, it's not surprising some people will pay over the odds for a used newspaper of pico-niche interest.

a) Make your existing currency more usable online, using some of the principles of crypto
b) Spend vast amounts of money making Bitcoin hodlers rich, just to use something totally unrelated to your national currency, that you don't have any control over and which is not at all tailored to what you actually want to do

Fro5tburn asks about the "risk" of running a TOR node, which anyone with a passing interest in TOR knows mainly concerns running exit nodes.
When Vespco politely replies to him, explaining it's not an exit node, the guy then claims he doesn't even know what TOR is (so why is he even in this thread, asking about the risks of it?) lazily asking to be spoonfed info on it.

AFAICS the regulators have the mentality that if there is something that Americans can use, personally or in business, then it should be regulated if necessary to ensure it is as safe and legal as possible under US law.

I think this is a far more appealing (to me and I suspect most people) and more interesting use of Changetip than people tipping comments on Reddit.
BTW, for people with more selfish motives to tip - *tip the charities that accept* (even if it means you don't get your monies back) and don't be too spammy. Seeing tips being ignored (or ridiculously small tips) makes it seem useless or a joke or spam. If people see tips being accepted by legit organisations they're more likely to look into it themselves.

I can sum up my point easily too:
[You're far more likely to get robbed by an unregulated Bitcoin service than a regulated bank. For obvious reasons.](
If you're paranoid about a regulated bank not giving your money back to you, you're free to keep your money under a mattress, in a safe, or buried 50ft deep in an forest in the middle of nowhere.
Most people, however, don't want the hassle, inconvenience and security worries of being their own bank, which is why many people real banks and, in the Bitcoin world, online wallets. 
Great, you prefer a world where people who get robbed are dismissed as idiots; I prefer a world where people are protected as much as possible from robbery in the first place.

I'm not blanket defending Paypal; there are things I don't like about them too, though due to their ubiquity they're very convenient. I also think Bitcoin can be useful, such as in the kind of situation described in [this post](
My objection is threads like this, which provide no evidence to back up their claims and which may end up costing people time and money. That some people just swallow garbage without even the most basic checks *because bitcoin* is ridiculous.
Where is the evidence that the recipient received even the equivalent of $4.48? The ["proof" given]( (slide 15) merely shows a Paypal deduction from the sender of $5 or **224.5 PHP** ($1 to 44.90 PHP).
Current rate (one month after that transaction) on Google is 222.93 ($1 to 44.59), so where is it that Paypal takes a "big margin" on the currency exchange?
Without logging into Paypal and checking their current rate, I'm willing to bet it's nowhere near $1 to 40 PHP, which it would have had to be a month ago for the recipient to receive ~200PHP ($4.48).
But let's pretend someone did receive $4.48. As of now, one month later, they still have $4.48. The imaginary recipient of the Bitcoin transaction currently has $4.35.

Your comparison page did, until it was changed after my post. Actually the total was 633.


I don't think it's an entirely fair comparison since they're two different pickup methods (WU being instant) but, yes, for someone without a bank account, who doesn't mind waiting and ignoring any potential cost of getting Bitcoins, it's a saving of ~100 PHP using Rebit over WU.
Drop the 1% BS, though. It doesn't matter to people who have to pay 5%+ how much of that you claim you're getting. I don't know if you're just hoping nobody notices, but it certainly doesn't make you look "100% transparent".
It would have been far better if the OP had stated you're a small startup and therefore don't have the advantage the big boys have yet (instead of later using that as an excuse), and dropped all the BS about 'killing' the remittance market and being better than every other service out there (you're not, and no sane person expects you to be), and instead just stuck to facts, that for who have Bitcoins you're ideal, for bank deposits you're about equal to WU, and for non-time sensitive cash pick-up you're cheaper than WU (without using the 1% claptrap).

I actually think something like "cheaper than WU" (or whoever, if it's allowed in ads) or "cheapest" (if true and provable with examples) is better than "free" anyway. 
"Free" is over(mis)used and I think causes many people to look for the catch. If they see the catch is 3%, that's a negative even if they end up still using it. 
AFAICS WU is less than transparent about their exchange rate costs, so there's an opportunity to be more up front.

IBM isn't responsible for where the PC is today, primarily Microsoft and Intel are, along with other hardware manufacturers and PC clone companies. 
IBM came up with a PC to compete with Apple, and in the process made giants out of Microsoft and Intel and spawned competitors like Compaq and DELL, thereby committing suicide in the market they were attempting to take over. To cap it all they even blew a second chance by working with Microsoft again on OS/2. 
By the time IBM had its act together, and OS/2 was superior to Windows, it was game over anyway, and 90% of PC users have had to endure one shitty OS after another to this day.
If you don't count this as failure for IBM then I suspect you're in the minority.


Nobody has called a PC an "IBM PC" for about 20 years, because it meant nothing then and it means even less now. Even the term Wintel made more sense than IBM PC, but we don't say OSX runs on Wintel, because it doesn't and it's absurd.

Cost of PC and annual cost of internet connection required to use Bitcoin? I'm gonna go ahead and guess slightly more than $8.




If you're not going to use your account at all for a year or two, particularly knowing those penalties, there's not really much point in having it. So those fees are actually zero for anyone who isn't insane.








The real comparison here is that ATMs exist on virtually every street corner, whereas Bitcoin ATMs are non-existent for almost everyone in the world. I'm still willing to bet you'll pay more than 175 PHP ($4) for an average transaction at most of them though.


25 cents. How much to send a transaction from Bitcoin to other coins? Oh yeah.

Yeah, I knew what you meant. My point is when WU does that, it's called (rightly or wrongly) a "hidden" cost, but when this site does it, they call it being "100% transparent". And I just noticed now they flat out *lie* about having zero exchange fees.
When I posted, *the difference between the sendbitcoin.mx rate and the Google rate was 100 pesos*, amounting to more than the WU 2%. The rates are all over the place now, but as I type the sendbitcoin.mx rate is 4525 and the Google rate is 4586.
That's less than 2%, but it's more than the zero they claim on their page.
They also seem to employ the same tactic of other "rebittance" services in only admitting fees that they claim they benefit from (guess we have to just take their word for that).
What do I care what they make? I care about what I have to pay, and if I'm getting screwed on their exchange rate difference (which I am) then that's a fee/charge/cost, whatever.
I'm sure WU could claim 1% fees if they conveniently excluded enough things.

That isn't what's happening though, and we all know it. What's happening is [people are openly organizing spam invasions/brigading of other subs]( desperately trying to get more people into Changetip/Bitcoin.
In real life nobody buys total strangers cups of coffee or beers or cigs because of things they say (even pretending that's what CT is about).
Furthermore, what people are tipping here is not enough for a beer or coffee, *it's almost literally nothing*. It's less than one cent in many cases, sometimes as low as "1 bit", which is essentially zero. 
Since there isn't even a coin in the carbon based world worth as little as some people are "tipping" here, imagine your own reaction if someone gave you a cent or two for something you said or did. If you're a normal carbon based lifeform, who wouldn't even stop to pick up a cent from the ground, you'd think it was a joke; when you realized it was actually meant to be taken seriously, you'd quite rightly think the 'tipper' was a fucking asshole.
If Changetip was confined to people tipping 'friends', ie people you tenuously know online, 'socially', and for a **minimum of $5**, then it might be what you and others are pretending it is. Of course, absolutely nobody would use it then, because the whole point of Changetip is to provide a 'defence'/excuse for spamming Bitcoin/Changetip and the people spamming are a bunch of cheap losers who think their collection of "Bits" is going to be worth thousands one day.
Ironically, while such idiots delude themselves that spamming Bitcoin will take it to the moon, it's more likely to just piss a lot of people off and cause them to view Bitcoin more negatively, as a spam incentive/enabler.
For anyone too socially oblivious to not understand other people's reaction to being spammed virtual pennies by Changetip, just imagine your reaction to people spamming this sub or other subs you read with useless amounts of Doge or Redd.

Could be. An individual can split 1,000,000 BTC over 20,000 addresses if they wanted to, of course, and it makes little sense not to split up vast amounts, so the top 500 address list is just one example of evidence of large personal holdings.
A thread on Bitcointalk a year ago listed a mere 20 or so individuals holding about 35% of the total. How dated the list is, how they arrived at the figures and how many people with large holdings were not listed, who really knows, but all available data seems to point to the same thing: a relatively tiny number of people hold most of the coins.

But their suppliers would also convert straight to fiat, for exactly the same reason. Essentially everyone has to accept Bitcoin for it to work, otherwise it won't work. Kind of a catch 22, unless a major player decides to properly accept Bitcoin to kickstart it.
And if a major player *was* going to accept crypto as an alternative to fiat, why would they choose one created by outsiders and already held by a relative handful of outsiders, rather than just create one of their own, with exactly the features and parameters they want?
People seem to dream a lot about some major company or companies 'properly' accepting Bitcoin and shooting their personal hodlings to the moon, but unless I'm missing something there's absolutely nothing it it for any company to do that.

The dismissive bit at the end is not meant as a cheap insult; a lot of people here seem to genuinely believe that internet money created by nobody knows a few years ago will replace or overthrow the "status quo" or established order, or whatever you want to call it. That banks or Governments are terrified of Bitcoin. To seriously believe that is insane.


And when the Government inevitably mismanages everything, because everyone agrees that's all Governments ever do, people can also consider Dogecoin, or Litecoin, or as yet not invented coin. Who is arguing otherwise? 


Then it depends on your definition of "better". Why is Bitcoin "better" than Dogecoin or Litecoin?
Or if I can buy absolutely anything and pay all my bills with my E-Peso, why would I consider Bitcoin? If everyone has E-pesos, and they're legal tender, why would my business bother accepting Bitcoin?
We all think crypto is great. But if not simply because you happen to own some and would like to cash out into dirty fiat some day, why is Bitcoin better than Government crypto or altcoins?

Honestly, this image would simply draw me towards WU, because:
1. WU is a major, well known, trusted brand in remittance.
2. It has a mobile app. Everyone likes mobile apps.
3. It has a recognisable promo code. Everyone likes promo codes.
4. "Nearly" is as meaningless as "up to". Is $5 "nearly $0"? $10? $50? What does Bitcoin cost me? WU says specifically $0 fees. (Asterisk or not.)
A couple of other points:
1. "Offer does not expire" is redundant; an offer that doesn't expire is not an offer, it's standard.
2. "Unlimited" has been done to death by non-unlimited things to the point that nobody seriously believes that anything is really unlimited, therefore it sounds too good to be true.
Get rid of those and you don't need the asterisk. Asterisks usually indicate (negative) conditions apply.
Best advice: stop trying to pretend that Bitcoin is free and can easily be converted to fiat everywhere. If someone believes that, then wastes time finding out it's not true, Bitcoin just looks like a time wasting scam. Pick specific instances where Bitcoin is better and highlight those.
Of course this all presumes this isn't just a bunch of people pissing time away in Photoshop on something that will come to nothing and be forgotten by the weekend. 
If you were serious you wouldn't be taking WU ads and trying to make Bitcoin versions, you'd be taking Bitcoin best case scenarios (for example in the handful of places that actually have 'Bitcoin remittance' services), and comparing WU to that.

No, I'm not making fun of you; I agree with you that WU has a presence on, if not literally, virtually every corner of the developing world. It's for that very reason I don't get the hate for it. It provides an excellent service that millions of people rely on. Nobody likes fees, but fees are unavoidable to make such a vast and efficient network possible. To pretend otherwise is silly.
Let's leave aside the fact that there will never, ever be a network of Bitcoin to local currency Agents of the scale of WU (500,000 across 200 countries and territories), and the interest some people have in Bitcoin remittance is not about helping people avoid fees, but about grabbing a slice of a multi-billion dollar pie for themselves.
I'm interested to hear how buying Bitcoins with currency A (fees and time-consuming hassle), transferring those Bitcoins (slow + another fee), converting Bitcoins to currency B (more fees and time-consuming hassle) is better than walking into a WU office or using the WU site (fee), and the recipient picking up their local currency 5 minutes later at their nearest street corner?

It doesn't matter how good his invention is. Bitcoin is not just a technology, not just software and code, *it's a currency* that some people here think could eventually replace what we use today.
I can't think of anyone else, off the top of my head, who invented something as important as Bitcoin is claimed to be, and could stand to profit so handsomely from it, or could have such a drastically negative effect on its economy, who kept his identity a secret.
Some people here seriously believe banks are paying people to "shill" against Bitcoin, and some people are happy to say "I don't care if Satoshi is Ben Bernanke". So it matters if banks are paying "shills" on Reddit, but doesn't matter if the banks or the NSA are the ones who own over 7% of all Bitcoins in existence?


So aside from being the creator of bitcoin, and the author of the most concise explanation of how bitcoin works, and currently owning over 7% of all Bitcoins in existence, bitcoin is not about Satoshi. Got it.

OP was not accused of fraud anywhere in that email; probably because they know that their process of identifying 'high risk' transactions cannot be 100% accurate. They know mistakes are made. They denied his transaction, refunded his money, apologized to him if they had made a mistake, and said try again at a later date.
Apparently OP didn't have any interest in contacting Coinbase to query the problem or in attempting the transaction again, he simply had a public tantrum about it, somehow believing Coinbase has no right to decide who they sell BTC to, and should simply ignore laws and regulations they are compelled to follow to stay in business.

The only withdrawal fee applies to amounts less than 7000 PHP and that fee is 50 PHP, a big fat fee of 0.7%.
The only way I can see that percentage rising enough to push the total fees to 10% is if you're paying your assistant a "regular salary" of about $20.
Feel free to correct me on that though, preferably with some actual numbers for a change, online businessman who pays people regularly.

Because I didn't lie, and you didn't refute anything.


No, I didn't say that. And the fact that you have to keep inventing what I said, rather than simply addressing *what I actually said*, only reinforces the fact that I didn't lie and that you can't refute what I said, because it's a fact.


Everyone can see what I wrote in [this post]( including you, and everyone can see that instead of simply quoting me, which is easy, you're going to the effort of misquoting me and making stuff up, because you cannot refute what I actually said.


You could have used less words to provide a good reason why anonymity and decentralisation matter to people selling legal items on Ebay, if you weren't incapable of doing so.


Even if I did say that, and yet again you're simply pulling imaginary quotes out of thin air, I certainly wouldn't need your approval to do so.

There was a [thread]( a few months ago with the (godawful) suggestion of renaming DarkMarket to "Free Market", with the rather naive belief that it would "FORCE" some kind of philosophical debate, because news reports would somehow apparently "have to" say stuff like "Officials are looking into banning the free market" rather than simply saying,"Officials are looking into banning an illegal drug and CP network calling itself Free Market". 
Other suggestions in the thread included Open Market and Open Bazaar.
IMHO, Open Market is a hundred times more 'neutral', professional and legit sounding than Open Bazaar, and even if you believe they didn't choose the latter as a 'dark' compromise, that Silk Road was and still is referred to as a "bazaar" seems like a good reason to me to avoid the word, if they wanted to distance themselves from SR.

Being anonymous in the early days, when Bitcoin was basically unheard of and worthless, is fair enough. But that a totally anonymous individual with unknown motives can hold over 7% of a supposedly serious, world-changing global currency is ludicrous.

People here think the only reason nobody at all is interested in Bitcoin (who isn't into it already) is that it's too expensive. So if everyone here pretends Bitcoin is cheap, people will start buying it, thus allowing people here to finally cash out their Bitcoin holding they paid way too much for.
In reality it absolutely reeks of desperation (just like the related Changetip penny spamming) and just makes Bitcoin look ridiculous and worthless.

Does anyone care what Rebit claims they make? Nope. People care about what *they have to pay*. Jesus.
Do you think a shop charging $10 is really charging $2, because other companies get the rest?


Again, how is the exchange rate hidden? It's right there on their site, just like the 2GO fees are on your site. If you don't want to use it, nobody is forcing you.

So WU are worse because they charge a fee for *something you don't even do*? 


I said you don't do instant cash. So using that as a comparison is dishonest.


1000 is the minimum accepted by your site. And for that the Transfer Fees are exactly what I said. Please explain how someone can pick up cash at pawnshops at the rate you claim it "starts from".


Well that's what you're doing, isn't it?




Yet again you deliberately don't compare like with like, for obvious reasons. You're comparing WU's instant cash (a service you don't even provide) with Rebit's bank deposit. Why not compare WU's zero fee bank deposit with Rebit's zero fee bank deposit?
Note: the image was taken a couple of hours ago, but I didn't get a chance to post till now. Even so, the rate (at Google, not WU's special rates) is now 1010 (£13.92) for the recipent to receive 1000 to their bank.

I'm going to assume you don't know what "abroad" means. I'm talking about being in a foreign country and depositing that country's currency into an account that was not mine. As in the UK, I was not even asked if the account was mine. No problem.
Even *your experience*, with its irrelevant details about fees, presumably because you were depositing to a foreign currency account, backs up what I'm saying. 
Hint: **You were able to deposit money into an account at a bank at which you don't have an account.**


This argument isn't about IDs. Can't you even follow a thread? It's about and maybe other people, claiming banks *only* accept deposits if you have an account with the bank.
