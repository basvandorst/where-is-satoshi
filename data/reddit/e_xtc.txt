Especially if you bought at 19200$

I think both will have to keep coexisting for things to go further. Other than that a hodler needs to know when to trade, and a trader when to stop. 
Not willing to should've would've could've but i just decided to take action instead of just waiting for a massive surge of the whole market. If it happens i earn less, if it tanks, i lose less.

Be like Belgium, 3 parliaments, regional level + national parlement, art thé head of which different partys being obliged to collaborate, and those parties aren't the same at each level... Doesn't work better but the debates are more in depth than American politics for sure

I firmly believe we will see sub 3k lows and the following highs sub 9k, but I'm what order i wonder. Bears trying to pull another 2018 December for sure.

Without VR headsets sold in the first place, there wouldn't be any VR porn coupled to AI powered sex dolls, indeed.

Right now, although slowly, Bitcoin is dipping while ethereum is on the rise. I personally plan on buying 3000€ of eth and will switch a bit later

Great news. I guess it's a hardware wallet equivalent? Wonder what happens if the phone has to be wiped when monthly updates mess up, like i had to reset mine a couple of weeks ago .

Yes i both won't and lost in such transactions in the past. All I'll saying is if course nobody can see the future but some people like to try their luck and it's ok. 
Personally i prefer trading between criptos ibstead of fiat. 
Iota/bnb, nebl/bnb and xlm/bnb are my favorite pairs. You place your bets, and if you're lucky you win. 
For example this last day there was a 33% bnb gain possible by trading with nebl

This! Don't sell at 13800$ to then buy back at 11400$. If you had 10BTC you'd only continue the ride with 12BTC. Who cares about an instant 2BTC profit

Indeed. The hardest part is to stop gambling after a couple of quick gains. In other words, keeping things reasonable is very difficult

It will go up for sure long term for sure, but will it shoot upwards a bit before retracting, or retract first!!?? Past days have been freaking tense

Just before the alts moved up, for once i said I'll buy bitcoin instead of litecoin... I think I'm cursed.  Next step : buy high sell low :D Classic winning.
