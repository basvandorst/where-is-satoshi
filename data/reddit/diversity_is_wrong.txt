I get what you're saying, the tone is a little offputting.  
  
Understand what I'm saying. Andresen was for some time the lead developer of a "trustless" system. This "trustlessness" being among the main selling points of the system.  
  
The trustelessness enabled a mode of interaction in which people could interact without having to trust one another, but they could both be equally secure in the results of the interaction.  
  
So why would Andresen set that attribute aside when attempting to verify the creator of this system? Why would it not raise questions that the so-called creator of the system was unwilling to use some of the very mechanisms he supposedly pioneered in order to verify his identity?

That's possible, but seems unlikely. I believe it is understood that there is no clear demarcation between which coins are satoshi's and which aren't.  
  
i.e. The first block definitely is, but as time went on and more people started to mine, there becomes a likelihood that satoshi controls coins in later blocks that wouldn't necessarily raise eyebrows if they were to move, and some likely have.

I thought of something like this too.  
  
But if someone had some convincing "doxxing" proof, they could still use it.  
  
And up til now, it seems to have just been Craig "doxxing" himself.

Go ahead and try to scam yourself $450M Balaji, good luck!  
  
As a bonus if you're successful, the 450M dollars will have a purchasing power equivalent to *450M dollars*.

Exactly, this is central to his argument but also makes his arguments totally illogical. I said much the same on the thread for his recent blog post here -- 
  
 I'm not concerned of motives for tax reasons or whatever, that's his own business. But saying you wanted to remain Satoshi anonymously but now you can't because the original "outing" was a deemed a hoax makes absolutely no sense. That's the perfect and only way to go back to anonymously being Satoshi, if the "outing" wasn't a hoax.

And Karpdawg never fooled anybody, the difference is tall spicy frappeccinos.

Good work gumshoe.

Actually the fiat world requires some pretty strong proof before handing over $450M as well.

The premise of this post is absolutely flawed.  
  
So Wright claims to be the real Satoshi, who was outed against his will, but he hoped to just "fade away," but after the outing was labeled a fraudulent hoax, he couldn't fade away and had to reassert his identity.  
  
 What ??  
  
The "outing" being labeled a hoax is the perfect way, and indeed the only way to "fade away" in such a situation. 
    
  
  
Then going on to long windedly say I'm going to do all these various things in the "coming days" hopefully you believe me, that's all I can do, reeks of a con.  
  
If Satoshi wanted the process to be as simple and straightforward as possible, he would use the blockchain/crypto to say, "Hi my name's Craig, also Satoshi, more info coming soon..."

This is an interesting reading of the situation. All that's been shown here is that if you don't have a password and you're asked to prove that you do, then you can't because you don't have it. Wow, amazing revelation, such technical progress!  
  
Bitcoinland is rife with fraud as I think you are aware Balaji.

Ok, there's no perfect system. If for whatever reason the US had been using bitcoin then, that article would say "How the US lost the private keys to billions of satoshis." Which would be essentially the same thing.  
  
The scope over which bitcoin improves on existing monetary systems is quite narrow and with those improvements come trade-offs, it's not entirely clear as yet whether a cryptocurrency monetary system would be a net gain over existing systems.
But regardless most the of problems in monetary systems and more broadly society, are political not technical.

NDAs are basically bullshit. They have little if any legal heft. Let alone cross-jurisdictional. Is he gonna get sued in the US for an NDA signed in London? yeah right...

You must be new here. ;)  
  
Scammers have gravitated to bitcoin, because they can scam with near impunity and there is no hook for them to be held onto.  
  
It is a central issue in the community, reputation networks and whatnot.  But even then a good reputation is only good until it isn't. This is a drama that has been played through many times here.  
  
One of the more famous memes *just two more weeks,* is actually an exception where there was some accountability because they were operating in the traditional legal environment.  
  
And the culprit in arguably the most spectacular btc blow-up, Karp-dawg, is another exception.  But who knows whats going to happen there? Maybe there's been some news lately, anyone know?

All very good points, that no doubt played a role. I'm not trying to crucify Gavin, I'm just saying that if he himself could recognize what some of the missteps were and share them that would be educational for all of us.  
  
Also, I can't help but point out the irony of all this occurring in the context of what bitcoin is supposed to be. It would take mere minutes at most to have cryptographic validation, so why all the media event and bright lights?  Those bright lights and big names, also no doubt swayed Gavin and others, but still.  
  
All this big media production, and convoluted steps of buying a factory sealed laptop, when all it takes is a simple act of signing something with a key known to be Satoshi's should raise some questions.

People are saying "Give the guy a break, he made a mistake yada yada yada..."  
  
Ok that's fine, and it would probably be in his and everyone else's best interest to detail what went wrong.  
  
The big question is --
*Why would he be satisfied with any 'proof' that would not also satisfy the world at large?*
@_date: 2016-05-06 03:37:43
Wow, thats crazy,  
  


  
This is really just the same as an individual or an exchange being hacked and having their funds transferred against their will. Which is of course not unknown in bitcoinland.  
  
Then there's this    
  
 &gt;The Federal Reserve Bank of NY **blocked the remaining 30 transactions, amounting to $850 million**, at the request of Bangladesh Bank


so an equivalent blockchain situation would actually have been worse, a la gox, or any of the other *numerous* situations where people have been robbed through hacking or fraud.

I was referring to the private key as a 'password.'
