You're quickly turning into one of the biggest cultists in this sub.

Wtf? I'm not saying they will never ever use Bitcoin. I'm saying they're not gonna use Bitcoin now. 
Or should we start threads about any company you want and say "they will start using Bitcoin" because they might do so in the future?
Just calm down. Nobody is attacking your precious coin.

MacDonalds isn't gonna use Bitcoin you tool! Use some common sense.
 Downvoted? Seriously?

The charges weren't completely dropped. I wish you people would stop saying that.

Dude, it's an exchange. There is absolutely no reason why the price will explode. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 13:06:45
Wait, what? Now people are denying there are tons of Ross/silk road supporters here? As dozens of threads have shown us over the past year. 
No, this has to be a joke.

My god. Stop posting this already! When will you people learn not to repost everything 50 times!
@_date: 2015-01-30 13:09:33
And these facts you pulled out of your ass i assume?
Let me guess. You are a Ross supporter so this simply can't be true?
@_date: 2015-01-30 09:24:58
A pump and dump. With the usual idiots posting moon pictures and stuff. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 13:08:19
You are seriously denying this place is filled with Ross supporters? C'mon, you can't be serious. That would be at the same level as denying grass is green.
