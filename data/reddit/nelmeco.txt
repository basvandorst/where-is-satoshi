Defiantly including this. That one video does the best explaining bitcoin in the simplest terms.

I might, but she doesnt understand cryptography or anyting related to that, neither do I.  I was looking more for a financial view on bitcoins.

hahaha, I've heard a lot of shit talk about them. I'm a bit hesitant overall to drop 650 in one place. I'm currently in college so money is a bit tight. So im not sure about BFL, although they do have that one that does 30GH/s right around my price range :(

If you've got minecraft I would suggest 
I've played it off and on for about 6 months. Never had a problem.
EDIT: My favorite way to play roulette.

Yes, OS and a few other things. Any recommended data recovery software? I know its  along shot, but I'm willing to try at least.

Including these too, thanks!

Yeah I figured, might as well try though. No harm in trying. I'll update if it works.
2.5 hours remaining in recovery
EDIT: Damnit, I can see the file, but the program says its been overwritten... I guess I'm out of luck. Thanks for the help. Theres 1 less btc in the world now.
EDIT2: partial recovery actually. Lets see if this works...
