lol mad cause you missed out.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:18:36
Nope, but also exchanges putting premiums on fees or not using Segwit is another thing to blame.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:17:15
Couldn't agree more

Improper selling of crypto with a debit card service, are you crazy? lol
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:54:14
Do you mean by the price performance, or the technology?

You should really only post advisories like this if the price has been down over two months, otherwise it comes off childish and makes it appear you don't understand the hedging or supply math.
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:58:38
Redeemable BTC is available to purchase already on the Bitshares, Ripple, and Stellar DEX networks, which pretty much function like a crediting sidechain with a live exchange in that manner.
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:43:47
Really good to hear, hope other major exchanges are soon to follow suit.
@_date: 2018-05-07 23:34:49
The network slowdown and fee surge last December was more then enough out of the various times the network has demonstrated the needs for increases in Capacity. In it's current state it can't even handle 1 million transactions or less daily without a large backlog and significant increases in transaction fees.

I use the mobile app here to transfer funds to the card from overseas almost every other day and works fine is a very nice service, get over yourself. 
From the mobile app you can send to a Bitcoin wallet address, and then can make another order to exchange instantly to the debit card through the app once the transaction is confirmed.
@_date: 2018-05-20 06:54:00
lmao, I'm still taking time to travel though and the extra computer time did pay off, though also to say I helped develop for an Altcoin network in addition to trading.
@_date: 2018-05-12 12:52:03
That's adorable xD

I doubt someone with that much business and money has time to run another active Twitter page and probably has better things to do with their spare time, kind of a delusional thought. It's still possible someone accepted large donations in a certain favor though.

How does something being expensive for operational use contribute to decentralization? It can be counteractive to reaching diverse adoption.
@_date: 2018-05-05 21:35:06
That is a point but I still doubt it lol, though still a good chance it could be someone they know well from conferences considering how fast complaints got posted here when they lost access to the account recently.

Yobit.net, should help with the transaction fees there also
@_date: 2018-05-05 21:30:59
I did used to run another altcoin's main twitter page, but believe in diversifying in many assets and feeling more patient with Bitcoin's current development compared to other voices I've read or heard that have debates on the topic. Another mistake is they think reddit represents the majority of the Bitcoin community and take primary judgements from here.

This is a tough decision but if absolutely have to upgrade this is a better solution then the side effects of a hard fork can cause, just my opinion.

Hard forks can ruin or slow down a brand due to duplicated chains, it's risky in that aspect if another financial group allows transactions from other chains which interrupts the supply/demand aspect of a product.

Long term shorting any crypto is definitely very risky, there's people who took stubborn short margin positions on Bitcoin at ~1,100 usd the other year and lost quite a lot of money
@_date: 2018-06-15 14:36:10
@_date: 2016-12-09 06:09:37

Sounds like self defense imo
@_date: 2019-02-04 05:31:58
Another convenient solution is to get a Chinese bank account and use Alipay with Localbitcoins.
@_date: 2019-02-03 17:22:02

Such a comical bluff on dumping Bitcoin that far against usd.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:37:44
Legitimate valuation, so many coins burned out of circulation from people who don't know or feel like splitting coins from old wallets.
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:25:58
The entire ledger is copied from Bitcoin and every owner doesn't have to be a previous buyer, that's what makes this situation more unique.
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:02:38
I agree on this being childish or maybe he was just making a joke, still seems salty though.
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:07:06
Big long term short on BTC, big money lost.

Crypto shouldn't be taxable anyways, it's just a good example.
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:32:43
This is a financial case, they're duplicating the potential ledger of wealth by not requiring all new users to have to initially purchase the coin, and it reduces the technical debt of position building compared to adopting a brand new asset. All the previous ownership data was preserved 1:1.
@_date: 2017-04-01 16:48:22
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:11:15
lol they're running out of time for things to pick on
@_date: 2017-04-21 02:45:51
Bitcoin withdrawals are still frozen on those exchanges in China so that explains the difference in price

@_date: 2018-03-26 18:14:38
Their description makes it more broad to apply for them as well because they're portable assets which can potentially be exchanged anywhere online.
@_date: 2018-03-03 10:44:06
Solid point
@_date: 2018-03-24 02:51:15

@_date: 2018-03-09 14:14:19
Someone selling 400 million dollars worth of crypto slowly over 4 months wouldn't crash any of the top 5 major cryptocurrencies, this feels like it's exaggerated after the fact to rile up emotions.

I got a "Bitcoin is dead" banner ad in a cellphone app lol
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:26:49
That's your opinion, I personally think it helps give more price stability to the original Bitcoin trading hedge after it's received so much gains over the years. A similar effect is happening with Ethereum/Ethereum classic.
@_date: 2018-03-11 14:45:35
I used BTC plenty while I was overseas in China &amp;Thailand since you can trade it through Alipay on Localbitcoins and Alipay also allows very fast 2-minute bank deposits to a Chinese bank card, so it depends on the banking infrastructure/country as well to how efficient it can be used for daily spending. In the US here also they have Bitpay and various other debit cards that are efficient to use by sending coins in batches to convert to a usd balance. All the processes I mentioned on a day the network is functioning normally generally take 25 minutes or much less to fully exchange coins into fiat.
The basic tools are there now to live off of cryptocurrency in most major areas so I don't believe one has to try really hard, and only quoted a couple of the many liquidation methods available.

Not sure if this system would work well with exchange or scripting errors on an operational level.
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:11:33
A fee-based replay protection scheme where all coins on the main chain are forced to send BTC to one sole address in order to keep their transactions separate from broadcasting on alternate chains is a terrible idea in my opinion and needs to simplified to make it more feasible for operational use.

The space will always need more innovation and new organizations.
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:19:21
Thanks for the post
@_date: 2017-09-10 10:18:40
Correct and I've already spent around $18,000 over the year,  these are the amounts I still have in crypto saved over.
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:35:41
On a long term scale this argument is baseless
@_date: 2018-07-30 10:07:35
lol It's just an Altcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-18 10:49:01
lol clowns
@_date: 2018-03-25 18:55:29
The OP is just expressing his opinion
@_date: 2017-10-14 05:02:19
lol this is not news
@_date: 2018-07-18 23:26:42
Damn that sucks dude, good you came out ok

I doubt they know the full process for all the phases honestly, he's overestimating them.

these kids are hilarious
@_date: 2018-04-29 19:13:27
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:33:40
I've had a good experience with my personal use of the network and testnet, and also like how it's sparked a large amount of organizations to take on more innovation in the Cryptocurrency space as well as research different approaches.
@_date: 2018-04-27 03:32:14
God forbid if we buy any other asset then Bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-04-22 07:39:50
Nice, I've been doing something similar for around 2 years.

lol this is becoming more childish then Ethereum/ETC
@_date: 2018-04-05 01:42:49
From the description I read it's connected to the main network through an Electrum server.
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:06:08
Ethereum is still solid technology in my opinion despite the arguments mainly about the startup venture process.

Recommend Bitpay and their Bitcoin debit card if you need a general account.
@_date: 2018-04-27 03:13:13
This is retarded and not what cryptocurrency is about.
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:45:20
People are still going to visit Bitcoin.com anyways...
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:21:48
It's not really about Bitcoin Cash at all or various ideologies, it's more about understanding how limited the current state of Blockchain Technology is, and staying open to or creating diverse solutions long term.
@_date: 2018-04-25 03:18:41
He'd make a great college professor.

Many of them actually have promising services, the latest stats are clear proof of that.

Satoshi himself mentioned they're capable of scaling up to Paypal/Visa: 
@_date: 2018-04-23 23:44:36
Just sound salty, it's more about tackling the current technical limits at hand then focusing on stuff like this.
@_date: 2018-04-07 07:35:50
@_date: 2018-04-14 16:26:49
These are more like alternative economies in the full picture, not generic assets...

Awesome that it's integrated with a light client, looks great.
@_date: 2016-10-22 16:19:41
He's right
@_date: 2018-04-21 02:03:05
@_date: 2018-04-25 19:35:55
You have a point, with the slowing block rates blocks seem to be filling even under the current average amount of traffic, not a good sign for the infrastructure being able to take high loads in my opinion - 
@_date: 2018-04-25 03:01:31
Depends on the usage amount of the main chain and more exchanges adopting Segwit to prevent congestion during high traffic, it should be easier with the latest release of Core.
@_date: 2018-04-29 18:43:00
It depends on if the blocks are filled or not to determine how much space is actually registered real time, and if they were using 60-80% of that much capacity, it would be good for the ecosystem currently as it is now. You can also use light clients which don't need a full chain data copy in order to transact.
@_date: 2018-04-18 22:38:01
I think moderating a popular subreddit can be demanding, so think it'd be fine for some groups to employ a general salary.
@_date: 2018-04-14 03:47:12
The struggle is real
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:40:35
@_date: 2018-04-25 19:57:14
Meanwhile they're currently getting full blocks with average traffic, and they'd rather spout meme wars then research into further solutions for the main chain.
@_date: 2018-04-01 08:49:26
We can trade whatever we want with responsibility and that's what a decentralized market is truly about.

@_date: 2018-04-01 08:53:54
I remember when I burned my GPU (GTX 650) on an external video card adapter trying to mine Crypto for about 3 months when I first found about it lol.
@_date: 2018-04-28 00:40:50
lol Savage
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:27:33
It's up to it's trading merit and operational capacity as a whole to decide more of it's value, these are all digital monetary units being weighted on basic supply/demand.
@_date: 2018-04-14 15:48:03
Definitely would utilize something more private when covering basic needs like that.
@_date: 2018-04-26 12:54:18
Close enough
@_date: 2018-04-27 23:54:32


@_date: 2018-04-09 23:28:07
If you live in the US you should use a Bitpay debit card, it covers up to a 50k usd balance.
@_date: 2018-04-21 20:29:58
@_date: 2018-04-27 18:19:07
Expecting everything to switch to a DApp for primary usage on an asset that currently has this much economic circulation is very naive.
@_date: 2018-04-23 23:08:47
Can't even have a debate without getting loads of downvotes, shame.
@_date: 2018-04-29 18:16:00
I remember burning out my old GTX 650 trying to mine on Nicehash during the summer in Florida lol
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:39:15
Thanks for the heads up
@_date: 2018-04-24 15:19:13
It's a solid point, though the network could easily adapt when it's in more widespread use to the point where users don't have to own the software to be able to use the transactions, similar to how Bitcoin transactions and wallets are hosted on several sites and exchanges today.
@_date: 2018-04-29 18:21:22
Great post
@_date: 2018-04-27 03:25:30
All I see is Bitcoin Core (BTC) listed on buy.bitcoin.com for purchase with a credit card. That notorious screenshot is from their block explorer page which is information only with no purchase options.
@_date: 2018-04-14 22:40:20
Having an orthodox set of token economics certainly isn't more important then developing better technology or alternative systems and doesn't invalidate good projects (especially those with distributions and incentives that allow for fair growth as well), considering how limited the current state of blockchain technology is today.
@_date: 2018-04-02 23:50:42
@_date: 2018-04-12 01:06:36
I'd recommend a mixture of both, though major banks have been giving more trouble to people who've invested in cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2016-10-11 05:15:28

Don't long term short :)
@_date: 2018-04-14 16:16:03
You need to do more research if you think limited cryptocurrencies are analogous to stocks.
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:56:40
Great animation btw
@_date: 2018-04-29 10:03:07
Thinking you need to fight them or any other project distracts from the true system (central banks and fractional reserve banking) we escaped from.
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:56:22
wtf lmao
@_date: 2018-04-21 21:41:45
Best typo ever lol
@_date: 2018-04-14 16:00:54
@_date: 2017-05-03 21:29:08
In this latest update they mention they're still in surplus though to support the backing: 
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:59:39
There's several types of solutions, for example the industrial grade Blockchains developed on Graphene that have shown to have high transaction thoroughput and capacity on Bitshares &amp; Steemit (statistics:  It's only the beginning of 2nd generation systems coming into the fray, and it's not all about block size either, as there's various bottlenecks that can come about in the original systems.
@_date: 2018-04-24 00:06:57
@_date: 2018-04-11 19:55:37
Pretty funny
@_date: 2018-04-14 15:52:40
It's actually a reasonable amount like $45,000 per year with no or low income, and a little over 2x more if residing overseas.

lol get over yourself
@_date: 2018-04-12 23:35:26
So cute
@_date: 2018-04-27 18:20:59
It should be more like let the technology performance and throughput prove what the best scaling solutions are. (Usage statistics: 
@_date: 2017-05-20 10:45:00
Bitcoin will still work as a great investment with the adoption rate and 2 halvings coming over the next 4 &amp; 8 years, so store of value wise it will still remain as a good option for now.
@_date: 2016-10-11 06:18:31
It's sad people always have to be sold some news over every little price movement.
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:12:28
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:14:39
Agree, considering 2 halvings coming over the next 8 years in addition to this, it's an easy patient investment
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:39:09
Yobit in the background :)
@_date: 2018-04-21 06:25:56
A fair amount of people on Youtube were knowingly trolling also on these low price predictions, sorry it got to you.

Savage mode lol
@_date: 2018-04-08 01:04:24
Could just be hearsay
@_date: 2017-05-02 02:37:56
who would hold through the price lift is what i'm wondering, they'd likely scale out early
@_date: 2018-04-28 00:07:37
Bitcoin's technology is fairly limited, so the sooner we look for more high throughput solutions the better. Something like Steemit couldn't run on top of Bitcoin without completely flooding the main chain in it's current state. (1.4 million average transactions per day)
@_date: 2018-04-29 18:46:42
The debate on a technical solution is far from over, the technology will prove itself over time. You can view the latest output stats of various chains here:

Late buyer? hehe
@_date: 2017-05-03 20:48:28
It's still backed 1:1, they just have been having bank issues lately

You can sell on coinbase for much more

Sounds like concern trolling at this point to me
@_date: 2017-07-05 01:21:15
You have some points but cooperation and respect is also important, everyone has something to potentially add to the community
@_date: 2017-07-18 23:39:04
The same thing happened with the Litecoin update so it's possible.

I'd say you could test withdrawal some altcoins also to another exchange like Bittrex instead then reconvert into BTC, I noticed sometimes the BTC withdrawals would be put into pending for no reason.
