Is that blind confidence or reasoned?
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:33:52
Not happening

Unless gates owns some bitcoin as well.

The issues that concern me the most:
1. Lack of mainstream adoption limiting utility
2. Lack of security meaning less HODL, less trust, continued dependence on fiat/banks
3. Competition in crypto market making today's bitcoin tech obsolete
4.Government crackdown whereby they invent new laws to limit BTC value  to protect the failing dollar.
5. Failing to find a solution to incentivize the miners after all the BTC has been mined

These two options are not mutually exclusive.

You have an algorithm or something?
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:25:55
Seems awfully arbitrary

At that rate your odds of owning a full bitcoin are close to 100%
.75 bitcoin is close to $3000 worth of bitcoin now, so you'll need to at this moment put in close to $1000 to reach a full bitcoin.
Projecting moderate increases you'll probably have to put in between $1,200 - $1,400 to reach a full bitcoin. At $100 per week that would take you between 3 and 4 months.
Of course the price could dip any time at which point you might want to put in more if you're projecting the price to continue to rise in the long term.
Pretty basic math.

Lmao at "grab a coat" T_D overlap must be huge here

Wrong answer imo
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:42:39
Give it to 2018.
2018 will be year of the bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-08-14 05:41:31
I don't know how true this is, but it's convincing on an emotional level to say the least.

If the talk of big money coming in is true 10k isn't unrealistic at all. Just HODL and don't worry about it because there are alt coins and then there's bitcoin, and no competition while disrupting world trade is a recipe for explosive growth.
@_date: 2017-08-11 07:02:11
Underrated comment.
It'll be spent by hardly anyone until value stabilizes, though. HODL mentality prevents that

You should change the question format to "how much bitcoin does the average bitcoin owner who doesn't mind giving out personal financial information to strangers hold?"
@_date: 2017-09-01 21:59:35
Bit will stick. It's the correct definition of what it actually is (a small part of a larger thing). To elaborate, it's a bit of a bitcoin, or a bitcoin bit. So we're not so much creating a name as we are defining it correctly.
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:35:49
You came up with all the other names, not me.
@_date: 2017-09-08 18:43:52
Dude relax,
Just keep calm and HODL
