Sorry, you had several large mines and you just got to own over 1 btc? 
@_date: 2015-12-15 18:00:03
No. I mean on bitaddress.org you can put in your bip38 encrypted private key, then type in the bip38 passphrase and it will spit out the master key which you can spend the funds from.
I just want to make sure that the passphrase actually works before I put money into the wallet. This does not mean I intend I spend from it.
@_date: 2015-12-15 16:49:16
I also think, provided my bip38 password is strong enough, then it shouldn't really matter if someone has access to the encrypted private key.
@_date: 2015-12-10 12:44:36
It's a double edged sword. 
If the policy was to return the same amount of btc, people would always buy stuff and then return it at the end of the return deadline if btc went up. 
Ie. You buy a PS4 bundle that costs  $400 usd, and you pay 1 bitcoin. 
After 30 days, bitcoin is now worth $800 usd. So your PS4 essentially cost $800. You decide to return it and get your 1 bitcoin back. Now you can sell half your bitcoin, and buy the PS4 with cash. This basically means you got your PS4 for free. Newegg is out $400, and you are up half a bitcoin. 
Basically Newegg would be acting as an options holder for customers. 
I think their return policy in your situation is fine, but what is not acceptable is the delay. You should get the price at the time you requested the return, not at a time determined by them a few weeks into the future.

I'm pretty sure if there's a hard fork, everyone doesn't have to move their coins...could be wrong.
Or if so, can move them at any time.
ie. If there was a hard fork today, coins in a paper wallet from 2010 can sit there for 20 years, and if I want to use them, I can then move them to the latest fork and use them.

How much btc did they actually give you?

@_date: 2014-04-08 15:46:55
Leaving it alone is not the solution. Startups, banks, well-formed companies, and most importantly people, want to ensure what they are getting into is safe and secure and that the rug won't get swept out from under them at some point.
If bitcoin is left alone entirely, there will be fear to devote resources to it because one day the government could declare it illegal or place severe limitations on it.
It needs some form of regulation to gain more widespread support. Ideally this regulation is minimal and allows freedom. Regulation that is too strong will hinder it. The recent release by the IRS wasn't very bitcoin-friendly. However, no regulation will leave people uncertain and unwilling to take such a risk.
We need a good middle ground of regulation to start. This will allow bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general to grow. Once it grows enough, it will reach a certain point where the government will not be able to enact anti-crypto regulations on it without causing severe economic stress to the public.
We are at a point right now where government actions could still really hinder its growth. At least in certain countries. Some countries will be crypto-friendly and the economies of those countries will grow. Governments that take a negative stance to it now may miss the boat, but regulations of some sort are required for the masses to at least get a foot in the boat.

Basically what you're saying then is the beer inside and the can itself are worth the same. 
I think the beer should be worth at least 5x that of the can. Maybe unopened can = 1 PBRCoin, empty can = .15 PBRCoin. That makes the beer itself worth .85 PBRCoin which seems like a fair ratio.
I guess if they come out with special or limited editions cans, those could be worth more.
Would make for great marketing strategy!

It shouldn't be worth any once it leaves the can. Loses all it's value. But if an open can is worth 1 PBRCoin, and am empty PBR can is worth .15 PBRCoin, then logically the beer in the can adds .85 value. Once that can is open, it's now only worth .15 PBRCoin. 
Will be hard to assign a value to draft PBR. That could be an altcoin on the PBRchain I guess.

I'd bet that 1 btc will be worth more than 1 oz of gold in 5 years. 
Who cares if gold currently has 2x the value. 
If gold ends up being worth more, and in 5 years I owe an oz of gold I really really doubt it would be worth more than $2500. So that's really max loss.
Whereas if btc is worth more, there's a good chance it's worth over $10,000. 
The winning potential with bitcoin is just so much higher.

Definitely not a legal bottleneck. Canada has some of the most relaxed cryptocurrency laws. It seems to just be a business decision by those companies.
My guess is because bitpay/coinbase or whatever payment processor they use is USD based. They probably feel confident in the exchange market price of USD. I think there's a lot more volatility on CAD exchanges so they aren't prepared for that.
Using the USD/BTC price and doing a USD/CAD conversion is also an added step. 
That's my thoughts.

You're actually missing the point. I'm well-versed in pot odds. That's not the point. 
Look up implied odds. 
The point is, the person that bets on gold only stands to win what gold is worth is 5 years. They may hit their flush 90% of the time, but at the end of the day, gold's stack just isn't very big so their winnings won't be high. The bet is more that gold will be worth a lot, than it is that bitcoin won't be worth anything. Given its historical price over time, I've postulated that it's very unlikely gold will be worth over $2,500 in 5 years time. For arguments sake, let's even be generous and say it will be $5,000. That means even if gold makes its draw, the max winnings are only ~$3,700.
In the alternative, the sky is the limit for bitcoin's value. Yes, it may only fill up 1 out of 10 times to make a boat to beat gold's flush, but when it does it has the potential to win a very large pot. 
That is why bitcoin is the better bet. It has nothing to do with their current values of $1,300/$600
@_date: 2014-07-17 14:07:10
Lol at the bank having any enforceable security over your bitcoins either. No way they'd take your bitcoins as security over a mortgage.
@_date: 2014-07-27 22:18:03
Lol! Confirmed you are dumb. 
Why wouldn't you put in $1,000 when you have $999,000 behind to see a flop? He may be ahead now, but relative to your stack sizes you've put in nothing and can stack him for a million bucks. Alternatively if you miss the flop you just fold.
Gold has a small stack. There is not much to win if it does well. 
Bitcoin has a huge stack. 
This is where you fail to see the true value in the bet.

Gold has been traded for centuries. It has been an exchange traded fund since 1966. In all that time, it's highest value is $1,923/ounce. I have a hard time seeing it will drastically surpass that. Do you?
Bitcoin has been traded for roughly 5 years. Each year it has significantly increased it's value.
Will it continue? I don't know. But in terms of potential, it has to have much more potential than gold does.
I just don't see how you can think that gold will all of a sudden skyrocket after trading at sub $2000 for 50+ years. Even if you're a big-time bitcoin bear, bitcoin still has to be the right side of the bet. $2,500 is a very reasonable ceiling for gold in 5 years. Let's assume it reaches $2,500. If you bet on gold, you make a whopping $1,200 profit.
Now look at bitcoin. Let's give it only a 20% chance of reaching $10,000. 1 out of 5 times it does. The other 80% of the time it plummets and crashes and is worth $0. That means on average, in 5 years it is worth $2,000. When it's current price is $600, that's a $1400 profit.
Then you also have to factor in that it's very unlikely to be worth $0, and the potential is also greater than &gt; $10,000. 
You can play with those %'s as you wish, but simple math and common sense should tell you bitcoin has much more potential which is why the bitcoin side of the bet is the much smarter option.
I'd like to hear your rationale. You accuse me of probablys and maybes and arbitrariness. Curious to hear your logic.
@_date: 2014-07-27 15:56:12

but merchants do help more people want to buy. not necessarily to hold though. the amount of merchants needs to increase such that the amount of people that want bitcoin drastically increases and bitcoins become scarce again, even though there's lots of selling taking place.

You don't understand poker and you think gold is going to be worth more than $5,000 in 5 years. You are delusional.
Is bitcoin going to be worth more than gold in 5 years? I'm not sure. I hope so. What I do know is there really is unlimited potential for it, whereas with gold, it's capped. If you're right about gold, you won't win much. If you're wrong, it's possible you'll lose a lot. Glad you're done talking here. It's been a chore.

LOL. What's with the attitude? I express my opinion and you get all uppity. 
Regardless of what ends up happening in 5 years I think you'd have to agree that it's very unlikely gold will skyrocket. It may go up to $2500 or so. That might be generous too.
Whereas bitcoin has the potential to go so much higher.
The fact that gold is worth 2x of bitcoin at present time is really irrelevant to a 5 year bet.
@_date: 2014-07-15 19:18:46
At present it is INDEFINITELY. No one knows when this will be resolved and BitBet has not provided any sort of deadline for resolution other than July 1, 2014, which was 2 weeks ago.

Here's gold for the last 5 years:
2009: $1087.50
2010: $1405.50
2011: $1531.00
2012: $1657.50
2013: $1204.50
The difference between the highest amount and lowest amount is $570. For some reason you think it's reasonable and likely that in 5 years this will exceed $2500. I put $2500 as a very generous ceiling for gold. In reality it's probably closer to $2000. You'll notice I'm still bullish on it.
Here's bitcoin in the last 5 years:
2009: $0
2010: $1
2011: $2
2012: $13
2013: $750

I think what happened is as follows. I got a new phone. I reinstalled Mycelium. At this point, the new HD wallets were out, so it set up an HD account for me. It probably showed me the master seed backup, but I ignored it, since I was still operating off my old legacy wallet. I imported my old legacy account.
There's no way the old master seed is stored anywhere. I have my old legacy account linked to some stuff so I can't forego it, at least not for now.

My understanding is it takes the same processing power to mine an empty block as it does to mine a block with hundreds of transactions. So really there's no point in mining blocks with less transactions since it just means you're losing out on potential transactions.

US people won't face conversion costs, but they do face lots of transaction costs.
Look at this: 
Many of those withrawal methods are costly. Bitcoin is also much more fluid. Lots of gaming sites have delays after deposits so they can confirm it's valid. Gaming sites also likely often face chargebacks from credit cards for stolen cards.
Bitcoin is a much better option.

But you should be able to track the fee portion of a transaction from the sender to the miner...but you can't. 
The fee portion disappears (burned) and then is newly generated 
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:27:43
I see that. But he got that all as 'newly generated coins'.
I thought they got 12.5 as newly generated, then all the fees.
But it looks like fees get burned or simply disappear, and the total is newly generated.

A wallet is where you store your crypto. Imagine your wallet in your jeans that stores your cash.
Where do you get the cash? From the bank, ie. exchange.
What you should be looking for is both an exchange to buy crypto and a wallet to hold it. You could hold it on the exchange, but then that exchange is in control of your coins, not you. If they want to steal it, they can. If they are hacked, you lose it.
Best practice is to buy on exchange and transfer it to your own wallet.
For exchange in Canada, either  as others have mentioned, or 
For wallet, download one of these from the App Store / Play Store
Bread Wallet
Play around with the wallet app for a bit and figure out how it works with a very small amount. Once you are comfortable with it, send all your coins there.
For best security get a hardware wallet. Ledger Nano S or Trezor are two good recommendations.

If mining is taxed as income than its taxed at the value it was worth when it was mined which was nothing to fractions of a cent. 
If it's taxed as property then it's taxed on capital gains when sold. Since the coins haven't been moved or sold, then there's no tax consequences there either.
