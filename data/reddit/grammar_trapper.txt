They save on credit card fees.

Not everyone has a bank account. Cash doesn't work over the internet. This is the whole point of offering different payment methods.

But if they didn't have the fees they can charge the same amount and make greater profit. Or offer a discount and be more competitive. Use your brain.

Yeah piracy is totally dead now.

But why?

You can't simmer the zimmer.

You can tumble your coins to have the same effect.

It is an exchange, while Coinbase is not.

I didn't watch the video, but he could potentially store the btc on the kiosk, that way it knows when it runs out and stops printing codes. Alternatively, there could just be some hard coded limit on the kiosk and the btc is actually stored on a server somewhere, and the customer just uses his code to later access the btc online. So the kiosk isn't actually sending bitcoins.

Supporting one political party so openly might deter other potential people from looking at bitcoin. Sure, it's great from a libertarian viewpoint, but it also has unrelated applications that a traditional republican might enjoy. However, if that traditional republican, on his first visit to the sub, sees us promoting libertarian ideals - he may be turned off before he even gives bitcoin a chance.

How many of those addresses are empty?

Aids. The answer was aids.

His taxes are lower if his bitcoins were more expensive. Shhh.

 Not recommended for long term storage. Also, never take the trollbox seriously.

The whole bitcoin economy could be disrupted by a relatively small amount of money. If the fed decided they wanted to kill it, they could. Having several currencies available makes it much more expensive to disrupt the idea of cryptocurrencies.
