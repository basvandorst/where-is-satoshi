Forwarded this to my boss to see if he'll want to use it in future projects. Thanks. :)

Not really? I'd love to know how many of a typical website's users even have Bitcoin to begin with, let alone would switch away because it's not supported. I feel like it's well under 1% for websites like Amazon.

One is federally guaranteed, the other isn't.

That is what I'm looking for, but Bitpay is also limited to only $100/day. :(

I know PayPal doesn't do it, but I figured one of those companies would send the money via PayPal to the merchant after accepting Bitcoins from the client. I trust PayPal's IPN to know when a payment has come through and for how much, and it doesn't require personal information like bank account. I can't say the same for Bitpay or Coinbase.

No one is acknowledging my question about whether or not any of these services have IPN...
@_date: 2014-09-24 00:46:55
So as a merchant, does this mean that any merchant can now accept Bitcoin with Bitpay and have it automatically converted and processed with PayPal?
@_date: 2014-04-14 18:16:11
This looks perfect! Thanks. Love their API/IPN. But I'm having trouble finding their PayPal documentation?
@_date: 2014-07-01 22:50:52
Wrong. A collection of autonomous atoms encompassing their personhood delivers the package.

So useful for the things my non-Bitcoin can already buy, giving me no reason to buy Bitcoin and risk an economic bubble burst. So in other words, not useful.

Honestly, I don't want them to start accepting Bitcoins. I don't think the currency is popular enough. Bitcoin being mentioned on Amazon as an acceptable currency would serve more as an _advertisement_ for Bitcoins than as a note of acceptance, and I don't really think Bitcoins are economically-stable- or technologically-easy enough to be advertised to the technologically-illiterate masses, compared to something much simpler like PayPal (which Amazon doesn't even accept).

Where would one get one of these?

It's not about deleting things. It's about reading them. Or at least archiving them.
If you are never going to read it, check the box, then click Archive. Having unread messages in your inbox that you're never going to read is useless, and feature breaking (like Gmail's various new mail notification applications).

I believe him too. The "community" attacking him sound like a bunch of jealous twats.
@_date: 2011-06-11 15:08:11
Or prefer stable markets.

Is it not possible to use your personal GPU with the BitCoin software?
@_date: 2011-06-13 07:31:04


And that will always be the case so long as you can buy Bitcoins with external currency. If the richest 1% of USD wanted to be the richest 1% of Bitcoin, they would just buy Bitcoins. Nothing is stopping that from happening.
@_date: 2011-06-06 19:38:23
Not only volatile, but technologically advanced. But of course one would be downvoted into oblivion for saying such things in the bitcoin subreddit.
I just hope that people here don't seriously think that Bitcoins will _ever_ be on Amazon.

You should acknowledge that you're not strategic investors. You are gamblers. You're doing it for the rush of the ride.
