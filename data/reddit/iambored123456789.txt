And it doesn't matter if the receiving one is legacy or Segwit? So if regularly transferring back and forth between non-Segwit exchange and my Segwit wallet, then 50% of my transactions will be Segwit?

Maybe speak to your friend again, or someone else that knows Bitcoin, that would be the quickest way. If that's not possible, you need to sign up to an exchange (maybe you already did that when you bought them). Then transfer the Bitcoin to the exchange and sell it. Follow the instructions on the exchange and make sure you do everything carefully, check all the addresses you're sending to/from before you press confirm. 
For what it's worth, the price should go back up eventually, maybe next year some time. But it's understandable if you need the money and want to cash out and play it safe. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:20:08
I'm guessing there's no Bitcoin ATMs in that country if crypto is illegal to even own. And if the government issues your credit card then they can see everything you spend your money on, so I would take that out of the equation straight away. 
I'm curious as to which country this is. OP might have to wait till next time they're on holiday in a more crypto friendly country and buy some then?

So if people tried to dump to crash the market, other people would buy to try to cancel it out ?
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:13:50
Do your research anyway, it's good to learn about things. But generally, more people see BTC as the one that will prevail and be safer in the long run. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:55:09


No but seriously, if you hodl, then in a few years when (hopefully) cryptos are widely accepted then you'll be able to spend them. And they'll be worth way more than they are now. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:55:11
Sustained being the key word. My definition of a crash would be if something disastrous happened to the value, and set it back a while. Even if the value dipped 40% and recovered within a week, I wouldn't consider it a crash. Just volatility.

Out of curiosity, how do you account for the loss of those hundreds of dollars, plus the fees involved in BTC transfer? Are you still making a profit, but just not as much as if you took fiat? Or are you accepting BTC in the hope that it will be worth more in a year and more than make up for the loss?
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:44:53
I can't imagine they're used massively. What percentage of the people in the city actually use Bitcoin? Maybe a few but most of them will be using exchanges. A lot of people avoid ATMs because the rate and fees are crap.

You don't have to buy 1BTC each time. You could buy half a bitcoin now, and when BTC is valued at $50k, yours would be worth $25k.

If he spends $20 he should have $20 worth of BTC, whatever that works out as. Not 75c worth. Sounds like fees got him, but surely 97% in fees is still a bit high?

Let's say for example McDonalds decides it's going to start accepting Bitcoin. Would McDonalds have to open a business wallet? And wouldn't this have to be managed by a bank or similar so that it could be audited? Then someone would have to invent an EFTPOS kind of system where you can scan your wallet and send BTC to McDonalds to pay for your burger, and the payment go through instantaneously?
I'm not too clued up on the tech behind it all but I find it fascinating and exciting. I'd love it to become mainstream, it just seems like there are a lot of hurdles.

How reliant is it on banks/PayPal/governments/etc accepting it as legit and not deciding to declare war on it? Surely banks are going to lose a lot of business if Bitcoin eventually becomes a new mainstream trading currency like USD has been for years?

Or would banks adopt it and offer Bitcoin accounts and trading services to people?

No different to stashing your money somewhere that no-one will ever find it, and then go senile I guess. 
What actually happens to BTC when someone loses their wallet? I know it's an extreme scenario but for example, in 500 years all 21million BTC have been mined and Donald Trump Jr owns 10million of them, and loses his wallet and keys. Does it affect the value of everyone else's money? What if 20 million were lost? 
Also let's say that one day there is a war involving fires (that wipes out paper keys) and EMP (that wipes out computers). What happens to the BTC of people in the cities that are hit?

Yeah there will be fees for transferring back and forth each time. There's not really any need to be trading often, basically you either want the Bitcoin or you don't. So you either put it in a wallet and leave it long term for the future, or you exchange it for fiat currency and cash that money out to your bank account. If you want to day trade then you might as well leave it on the exchange as there's no point paying fees every day.

Even if 50% of new investors flock away, and 50% stay, isn't that still a good thing? Those remainers will tell their friends about Bitcoin, some of them may start spending it. At the end of the day, the more people that accept it as a genuine mainstream currency, the better, no?

EFTPOS is your general debit/credit card reader machine. I think they have already developed or are developing ones that could be used to make BTC transfers with smartphones. 
The problem with wallets is, at the moment they are generally for personal use. A huge business like McDonalds would have thousands of transactions going through it and need to be accessible to auditing companies. At what point does it become more advantageous than just using good old USD or whatever the local currency is? Won't BTC management services basically end up turning into banks themselves, which defeats the whole point?

That's a pretty irresponsible way of living and is part of the reason why taxes and bank fees/interest are so high. Because so many people borrow money they have no intention of ever giving back. 
Even if in 30 years you take out a loan of 3BTC or whatever to buy a car, you're still going to owe that 3BTC to someone. Doesn't matter if it's BTC or USD or Yen. Someone's going to want their money back.
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:29:36
I guess high enough that I could take out my initial investment, and still have a substantial amount of BTC to hodl. Then if it ever crashes, at least technically I never lost anything, I'm just back to square one.

I didn't think it was many, but I think it's more known about than you realise, and that's rising very quickly. Yesterday at work a guy was reading the newspaper and commented about cryptocurrencies, and started a discussion with a couple of other guys sitting nearby about how it was too late to invest, etc. So they've obviously researched it and are aware of it. Hopefully in a couple of years they'll realise it's not just about investing. Then last night I was sat at a bar having dinner and drinks and there was a couple of guys next to me talking about blockchain, among other things. 
It really surprised me, hearing people just talking about it day to day. And I found out yesterday that there are a few bars/cafes in my city that accept Bitcoin payments, and there are a couple of Bitcoin ATMs as well!

I hope there's a dip, I've got fiat sitting on an exchange and would rather it be BTC. Sent it there to buy during the last dip but didn't get round to it so I feel like I have to spend it in a dip out of principle now lol

There are definitely bots on each exchange. You post a buy order at $10k, a bit will immediately post one at $10,001. Forcing you to make a higher one, etc etc repeat. This just artificially forces the price higher. Someone emailed an exchange the other day to ask what the deal was and the exchange straight up said it was bots and they are allowed.

The general advice is that if you buy coins on an exchange, if you're not going to be doing anything else with them on the exchange like trading them any more, you should send them to your wallet. Then it doesn't matter what happens to that exchange because you have your BTC in your wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:27:11

It's a bit confusing, but there has been some info and discussion on it recently on this sub and others. I think basically it boils down to if you cash out your Bitcoin and it has made a USD profit, you will have to pay taxes on those profits. But it's a bit more complicated than that so I'd do some reading if I were you. Or if you're dealing in large amounts, get an accountant.
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:25:05

That raises the question, for paper recovery keys for hardware wallets. Some people keep a couple of copies of the key, like one at home and one at work or in the bank deposit box or whatever.

Depends what the interest rate is on your CC. If you can balance transfer onto a 0% one I'd invest at least half of that $ into crypto, if not more. Then in 6 months, cash in your crypto and pay off the rest of your CC. Then start putting more into crypto from then on. 
Getting rid of fiat debts is good, it gives you less stress and more financial independence ie more of your income can go into Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:46:32
Good point, I guess the IRS just expect you to be honest about it. Technically they don't know anything about any of your Bitcoin movements, they can't audit your wallet like a bank account. They don't even know how many wallets you own. 
But if they decide to audit you and they find out you've been deliberately lying to them, you're in big time fucktrouble. Like to the point where it's not even worth trying. Which is why there are a lot of posts on here at the moment asking about tax implications.
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:42:21
Yeah exactly, you hodl until we're all getting paid in BTC and spending it in the shops. Then it won't even be hodling. It will just be your savings account. Sad that people are buying BTC with the intention of selling it back to USD later, no intention of it ever becoming an actual currency.

Are you certain on this? I read on another post that if you bought Bitcoin and hold it, there is no tax payable. But if it increases in value and you exchange it, you immediately owe gains tax on it. Whether it's for fiat or goods, or even for another crypto? Where do they draw the line at like-for-like when it comes to cryptos?

Some people come here genuinely curious about which is better between BTC and BCH, and instead of getting a clear answer or pros and cons, they just get downvoted and called a shill. Same with r/BTC. I know a lot of people on each sub don't want to hear about the 'other' coin, but we should still try to point out the positives of BTC rather than just shitting all over anyone who dares to mention BCH. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:40:23
Yeah hopefully the public would see past it and blame the terrorists instead of Bitcoin, but you know how the media can spin things and how dumb some people can be. 
The current UK government has a massive hard on for invading privacy, and hates encrypted communications apps like WhatsApp, and has used the 'terrorists use it!' rhetoric to try to turn people against it and justify intercepting people's messages. I don't think people really took them seriously, because if terrorists are gonna communicate in secrets they will find a way, WhatsApp or no WhatsApp. In the same way, terrorists will transfer money Bitcoin or no Bitcoin. They'll just use cash. 
The only thing is that WhatsApp is ingrained into daily use, and Bitcoin is not, it's a bit more unknown so it would be easier for the government and media to spin up fear of it.

A month ago I browsed some finance subs to get ideas of what to do with my savings. Most people advised to put into stocks and high interest savings accounts, and a couple of people said they had 10% invested in crypto. So I put my savings into a HISA and then put about 30% of it into crypto. I wish I would have just put the whole thing into crypto. 
My savings is making 3% returns per year. My Bitcoin has made like 80% in 3 weeks. Hindsight hey.

Because if you buy 1btc for $8k, sell it for $10k, buy it back again when it's $8k then you just made $2k. But yeah it's generally not recommended doing that too much because you can't predict if/when it's gonna go up and down.

Plenty of people pay rent in cash, I think it would be similar? Ie you would have to declare the rent as an income source and be taxed on it. Might be complicated as you'd have to work out what the value of Bitcoin was to USD at the time of the rent payment, so they know how much USD to tax you?

@_date: 2017-11-29 15:06:09
I don't get where people are paying these ridiculously high fees? I use Bread which is notorious for setting high fees, and I only ever get charged around $3, and the transaction goes through in 10 minutes or less

If the majority of people sell their B2X for BTC after the split, will there even be a dip for BTC? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:00:42
Did she specifically forbid you from investing? Or just didn't know? I mean if you've been investing this whole time and she hasn't noticed and you haven't missed the money, then it can't be that big a deal right? And now you can pay off the debts and house, you will both have more disposable income to spend on other things! Like buying more BTC ;)

oh you gave him the gift card? who was the guy?
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:30:54
Tesla will probably make solar powered houses by that point. And accept Bitcoin for payment.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:33:56
tbh I just keep the webpage of my exchange open, since that's the price that I'm going to be dealing at. I also have an app on iPhone called BTC Ticker, that you can choose you exchange on and it gives you the real time rates.
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:52:00
If you email the market rate controller, they will raise the rate for you or freeze it. I sometimes ask them what the rates gonna be next week and they tell me

People can watch whatever they want. The discussion isn't about whether it's a good show. It's about how advertising Bitcoin to millions of people will affect the market in future. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 04:47:08
Haha I was asleep when all this happened. I just looked at the chart today.
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:53:50
Jks not jks tho lol enjoy your 2nd hand Kia uncle
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:43:50
Just out of curiosity as I don't own one; what happens if your Trezor is stolen? Can someone access your private keys, or is it locked with a passcode? Do you have to act quickly to sweep the wallet somewhere else asap if you realise it is stolen?
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:39:44
Can you elaborate on "Users will be able to split their coins"? I've only been using Bread for about a week and I like it but want to be clued up for when the fork happens. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 02:00:56
Umm I sent $2000 yesterday for $3... 
@_date: 2017-11-06 06:40:29
Ah ok. I was going to send some $ to an exchange then see if a nice dip happens and buy with it. If not, that's cool I'm not desperate to buy or anything, I will just hodl what I've got in my wallet through the fork. 
Bit wary about leaving AUD just sitting on the exchange while I wait though so not sure whether to do that. But on the other hand, it takes a couple of days to transfer AUD onto it which is a pain if you spontaneously want to buy BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:43:33
Same in AUD! Next couple of days I should think
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:02:10
Where do you live and how are you sending the money to Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:31:45
So only around 800 people declare their capital gains from Bitcoin on their tax returns. Out of all the people in the US that trade in it. Will the IRS start chasing all the people that never declared? Will there be fines for avoidance?
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:32:33
Is it just BTC and BCH that use the same hashpower, or are there others? Sorry I'm not too tech-savvy on the actual mining.
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:40:26
$20 back then or $576k today. Either way that better be a damn good pizza.
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:26:18
True, I don't mind waiting a few years for security and infrastructure, as long as BTC does one day become widely accepted. Even if like people say, it becomes the 'gold' that other cryptos are measured against. I wish more exchanges and wallets (including mine) would adopt Segwit sooner rather than later.
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:44:22
So if you have $100 of BTC, you would end up with $50 of each? Or $100 of each?
@_date: 2017-11-09 07:16:55
Do you think people will take a few days to move their BTC back to alts? I was pretty surprised with BTC rate today. Basically a quick up and down over a couple of hours and it's basically back to where it was a few days ago. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:52:31
Do some reading and research on it. Only put money into it if you really believe in it. Not if you want to make a quick buck. Cos that might not happen, then you'll be disappointed.
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:28:36
4:37 tomorrow morning 
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:41:41


You realise this is true for any cryptocurrency though right? You haven't named anywhere that accepts BCH as payment, and are ignoring that other cryptos change in value as well?
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:27:50
How would you continue profiting off your hodl? You're gonna have to cash it out or spend it eventually, at which point you will be taxed no?
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:53:14
BCrash 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:00:23
I think once it confidently breaks $10k it will rise quickly toward $12k. Then $15k. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:56:39
Yeah until it crashes, or something bad happens. Then for the legal cases, they were suddenly never friends, the driver was breaking the law and terms of insurance.
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:11:07
hodl it forever
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:52:54
Do the currency conversion then, the same concept applies. When the price is stable over $7k, does it put people off selling at $6900? 
It doesn't matter what the numbers are, it's the concept I'm asking about. Bud. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:51:01
I haven't even told my gf that I hold Bitcoin haha it's my own little thing to dabble in. I'll surprise her one day and buy her a coffee with it
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:36:16
What are the advantages of a hardware wallet like Trezor, over an app wallet like Bread for iOS? 
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:20:05
Won't cost you as much money
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:37:52

Or just use the search bar as this has been asked 100 times already
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:58:49
Ah I just found this on Google for anyone also interested: 
am having a read of it now
