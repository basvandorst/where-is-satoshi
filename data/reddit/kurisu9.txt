Yeah, many Bitcoin peeps agree with this concept. And i also agree attaching physical world value via PoW to Bitcoin helps give it merit

true true... i didnt even include how the most important feature of decentralization can help via the reasons you gave. thanks for that insight 
@_date: 2018-06-28 10:04:52
yep very true

I'm using the term bubble as in the ignorant mainstream statement of "Bitcoin is a bubble that will crash to zero/become worthless". Anyways yeah I agree with what your saying. I'm just wondering if BTC can stand long term as a store of value for the reasons I mentioned. I def do think its a possibility 
@_date: 2018-06-28 09:30:53
Yep totally agree

Actually I was really professional in my post. I facilitated a piece of dialogue with a valid question etc. 
If mentioning one security risk in detail magically makes a post not become FUD then here: 
The security assumptions of using a LN channel for payments:
The blockchain is functioning well (confirming transactions quickly)
Channel nodes can keep secret data safe
There aren't any significant bugs in the software
With the Lightning network specifically, the security of the off-chain payment always depends on being able to take the transaction onto the real blockchain "if needed". When both parties cooperate, the number of on-chain transactions is minimized, but both parties rely on being able to cash out, using the real blockchain, if the other party stops cooperating or goes offline for an extended period of time. In addition, if the other party acts maliciously, you rely on being able to use the blockchain to punish their malicious actions.
One security risk lies here: if you cannot get transactions confirmed into the blockchain, you won't be able to get your money out of the channel, or to take counter measures when the other party tries to cheat you! So a well-functioning blockchain (confirming transactions quickly) is a definitely one security assumption of using the lightning network. So block crowding is one risk, since there won't be enough room for your transactions. Miners could also be bribed to not mine your transactions, although this is not a severe risk since it is likely that a different miner would confirm your transaction.

huh, concern trolling? First time hearing that one actually haha. Nah just throwing out a topic of convo just for fun 
@_date: 2018-06-25 03:51:01
Yeah I mean it is actually a legit concern whether its fud or not. Just because someone mentions possible vulnerabilities doesnt mean they are trying to spread negative vibes on the project.

My hash seems to be untracable now?? If you click the link above, now its saying that this has doesnt exist!
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:57:15


Oh I dont think I can do this because this transaction is from one exchange to another
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:48:41
seriously? 
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:21:45
Now it seems like when you click the link I rovied above it says my hash doesnt exist ?? what happened??
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:47:43
well its been almost 18 hours so far. so 420 minutes for just 1 confirmation? if I need 6 confirmations then thats 420 mins x 6 ? 
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:51:09
also, what is CPFP.  And an estimation on how long it will take my transaction? Will it take a day or two ?
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:28:12
Interesting, For at it was visable on blockcypher but now says its non existant. But now its been over 17 hours and still no confirmation.. Am I ever going to get my tokens lol ?
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:49:37
Sorry, what is RPF ?
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:22:33
The link I provided shows my Hash now does not exist? what is going on ?
