Ah the trough of the hype cycle... Power through it or fall into despair..

This looks awesome. Great job.
I am trying to build a site that integrates tipping for content creators. What api are you using for tipping on your site?
Or are you hosting the wallet yourself? If you are, doesn't that open you up to a bunch of regulatory issues?
I was planning on using changetip's api until I saw your site, but I'd rather not have my users have to log in with changetip.
Anyway, thanks for your help. And again, great job on the site!

I do believe the concept of bits is the way to go, I'm just not so sure about the moniker.

So I'm guessing i shouldn't bother with the *Mastering Bitcoin* book?

I've got a couple of app ideas that would rely on micro payments, but not sure if it's best to implement my own micro payment channel, or use the coinbase api, or wait for something like microTrx talked about in this article.. Any thoughts?

Yes, and i wouldn't be comfortable giving that info to a stranger on local bitcoins either. To me local bitcoins works best as a craigslist for bitcoin, where you can meet someone locally and give them cash for bitcoin.

I like the goal behind bitsquare, but i don't think it solves the problem. 
It doesn't remove the trust factor at all.
Instead of trusting a large company like coinbase (who needs to pretect their reputation to remain in business) with my banking information, I have to trust a random stranger with it.
And instead of relying on the entire legal system to solve any issues, i have to rely on another random stranger who plays the arbitrator.

Are you comfortable giving a stranger your bank account info?
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:39:07
Don't you see that as a problem?
If you thought there was a 1% vs 99% problem with the current financial system, the distribution of wealth in bitcoin is a million times worse.
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:11:04
How does that make any sense?
Deflation just exacerbates the problem...

That is true... The average user will, and should only use a hosted walker provider for day to day use. That's the only way Bitcoin will ever go mainstream... And that's how it's going to happen. Do you run your own SMTP server? Or do you use gmail even though Google mines all that data?
Bitcoin is digital cash... And like with cash, some people will use it as cash directly and others will rely on banking services (aka hosted wallets) to manage the cash for them...

I had this exact same idea about a year ago. I've been meaning  to actually build something like this because, if nothing else, I think it'll be a great experiment. 
If anyone wants to collaborate on building something out, I'd be happy to finally get started.
My primary concern would be that the community of people that use bitcoin is already pretty small, and we would be targeting a subset of those people who would be happy to pay for content that they already get for free now.

Yes it can. The entire current banking system is a subset of what's possible with Bitcoin. You can and will have Bitcoin banks with fractional reserve lending.

Lol. Wtf is this supposed to be?

There are three versions of the sovereign individual, with three different tag lines, but all by the same author. Which is the right one?
Also, if anyone has a PDF of this book, I'd really appreciate it if you could send me a copy.
