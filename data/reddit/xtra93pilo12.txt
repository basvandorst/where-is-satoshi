lol lets hope we consolidate near the high $10k and low $11k area for the next week :)

lol I think "blood bath" is a bit of an over exaggeration. Going down a few % daily is expected of Cryptos. Now if you see more than 20% and every day for a few days then we could day if a dip/'blood bath' :)) 
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:35:52
That would indeed be very promising. I would though be very happy with a consolidation in the high $10k and low $11k area. But honestly if we don't go under $10k I'm gonna be sitting very nicely here :)

lol explode and crash are bit too extreme of words. Just consolidating between high $9k and low $11k. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 19:19:45
Volume still not too big but very glad it's holding up here. We could say we are finally in a uptrend once we break the $12k from the January dip. :)

I guess the fear is that the "pain" from such a crash will kill investor moral and it will take longer than expected for investors to consider buying back in. There is after all only so much pounding investors/ppl can take before they say "hell with this investment, sure it'll go up in a few years but I don't wanna wait". That's the biggest issue here. Otherwise long term I don't think it will matter much.

Nope love it :)) I don't like drops lol but sideways action makes me sleep well. Sat through a bunch the past few years on many coins. I like this consolidation in the high $9k and low $11k :) pretty cool we are in the upper end of the consolidation and tested ~$11k twice now this week.

:') hahahaha

I think neither. I think we are just consolidating between high $9k and low $11k. :) which I think is very good after Januarys correction I think this consolidating is very healthy. Volumes are OK but nothing fancy. Even kinda low which happened last year briefly during the consolidation phase too

I'm very glad that over the past month bitcoin has held the low of around $6k and consolidated to set a semi-solid support (even though support might not mean anything for Cryptos lol) in the mid $9k and low $10 area. Defintiely very very glad we are not having the dump we saw in January. At least we can say the market isn't super bearish now and either consolidating or slight showing some bullish momentum even though the Volume isn't great. I've seen these kind of consolidation in the past few years :) overall very happy even though I'm not holding any BTC but it affects the overall crypto market so good :) 
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:33:31
hmm I guess it depends on what you see as the "break out" point. I guess if it goes above the $12k area we could consider that an uptrend. Until then I feel like we'll stay in this consolidation. I would be very happy if we stay in the high $10k area this next week. As long as we don't drop to the mid to low $9k I don't think we will see a dip. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:16:37
I think the main reason for the fear is that since the trustee is dumping it on the market vs. private sells by the time he's done the public feelings will be hurt since the price would of tanked so much that it will take longer than expected for it to recover. It most likely will recover and we will reach Hights but its all about time. If the price goes under $1k it will take a bit longer for general ppl to consider going back into this after the tank. That's most likely why the panic is here. So long term most likely not bad but short term (1 year) it could be problematic :) just a thought.

Been gathering data for a few years based on Crypto market and the Equity market (also compared to the Bond/Fixed Income, Commodities and Forex markets) and based on the data there is literally almost zero correlation between the two. Completely random in the up and down movements :) I assumed when the Equity Market goes down then money might flow into the Crypto market (a correlation you see when you compare Equity and Fixed Income market with the commodity markets) but instead that doesn't seem to be the case. Most likely just cause the Crypto Market is still relatively tiny and not as stable as others :) 
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:36:51
yeap yeap :) I've honestly been really enjoying the past few weeks of it staying above the $9k and in the $10k area. Solid consolidation on OK volume. Nothing fancy but def nothing awful :) 
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:42:24
After it went from $8500 last week to $11700 and you don't think there will be a 'big dip'??? Or did you expect it to keep going to $20k without ever being down 8% on the day? Nothing big about it just a typical dip for a typical uptrend. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:19:42
It is an issue. He shouldn't be allowed to dump on the public market but instead do a private auction. You don't see the US government dumping the $50 million on the public market.

Who else here feels like BTC is just consolidating between high $9ks and low $11ks. I feel like ppl panic when BTC goes down 5-7% and then get way to excited like today when its at $10.9k and up 5%. Honestly I feel like we are just consolidating and until we either break low $9k or $12k we can't say we are in a bear or bull trend. Who else thinks that? :) 
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:30:24
Would be cool but lets just hope we don't test low $10k area again in the next few weeks &amp; stay in the high $10k and low $12k area :) would be a great and nice slow trend up :) 
@_date: 2018-03-01 18:48:16
lol don't get too excited. It's just chilling between high $9k and low $11k area. Typical consolidation for BTC. Volumes are avg to the lower end :) which is overall good. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:30:47
broke $11k. Lets see if it holds it :) could just consolidate near low $11k and high $10k.
