It is just a market, for you to sell your bitcoin somebody has to buy it and pay you for it.

IDK, just checked based on your comment and it looks like they will delay it till 16.0 that seems to be scheduled for May?  
Thats a lot of time with the mempool this big.

Well, for starters seeing the exchange rate in dollars and not in thousands would help by looking more attainable, loads of people see the price in 10k and think the boat sailed already

Ledgers with the same seed are clones.

Kraken allows 25k if you are verified to level 3, and 100k if you are special account of level 4

its very unlikely that the price will double again in less than one month, but a man can dream

You need to transfer the bitcoin to an exchange and there sell it into dollars or euros, then transfer that currency to your bank account.

I think you might be able to connect a ledger to electrum, craft the raw transaction that you want and have your ledger sign it and then publish it.

Verification, sending id proof, address, stuff like that, its basically anti-fraud measures.

Yes, but exchange rate is still per btc and seeing it in the thousands discourages people from buying. Specially first time buyers

It would definitely make the coin more accessible for newbies.
