He's not exactly a paragon of moral incorruptibility. The dude sold a plain white t for $120.

Dude thanks!

Did you even read his comment? Nowhere did he say that the network security isn't relevant. He said that it is only one factor that impacts its value.

Brawndo's got what plants crave. It has electrolytes.
But what are electrolytes?
IT'S THE STUFF THEY USE TO MAKE BRAWNDO!

Yea, it's not THE reason its valuable. It's a contributing factor in a whole slew of market forces that determine value based on market demand. Security influences market demand, but it doesn't create it independent of other factors.

My point was that it is *more* stable than the Bolivar, not "almost as stable." Stable enough that bitcoin is growing in usage as a hedge to the hyperinflation of the national currency and the overall breakdown of the national economy.

You pulled those numbers completely out of your rectum. Don't cite statistical figures to make yourself sound authoritative if you aren't going to back them up with citations.

Please tell the people of Venezuela about how currency only "changes a few percent because of politics."
I'm not a tin foil hat kind of person, but to think that your economic system is too strong to collapse is naive. Current financial systems are not backed by "gold, petrol, or even a nation"--  they are backed by trust. Trust that the economic system will continue to function and people will continue to accept its currency as a medium of exchange. It's fine if you don't personally see the value in bitcoin-- no one is making you buy it or use it.  What you need to see is that there is a growing number of people willing to place their trust in technology rather than in political institutions.

Don't listen to him; he has no idea what he is talking about. Ethereum is an incredibly useful platform and serves a completely different function than Bitcoin. There are lots of 'scamcoins' that aren't scams, they are just designed to provide a different service than bitcoin is. Tokenization in Ethereum, Stellar, 0X, BAT- they are good at what they are for, and will have their own complex ecosystems that don't necessarily compete with Bitcoin as a currency.
Everyone here hates coinbase, but right now there is a coinbase/learn program that has pretty good little informational videos to teach you about what different cryptos are for.

No. It is important. If you are going to engage in open discourse and make a claim, you need to be ready to back that claim. You can't present some arbitrary static total for a constantly changing, well-established statistical figure. It is disingenuous. 
Here, I did the math for you. In 2016, 54.75% of gold was used for electronics or jewelry. Stop lying on the internet, it makes you an asshole.
Here is my source:
Have a wonderful day.

Please, then by all means share your source with the community for our betterment and understanding.

It's funny because, after all of his examples, the amount after the "crash" was substantially more than the original amount-- demonstrating the long-term growth. It's not funny any more because I had to explain it to you.

You don't need to be Sherlock Holmes to guess what gold is used for. Whatever helps you sleep at night.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:08:48
You were 15% off. That is a significant amount.
You weren't lying, you were just wrong, and hopefully you learned a lesson about just making up statistics so that you can sound smart on the internets.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:44:34
How is it irrelevant? My argument isn't that gold has a physical use, my argument is that you made up statistics to prove a point. I believe my original statement was that you "pulled them out of your rectum." 15% in this instance accounts for 649 metric tons of gold. It is more by weight than almost 2X all of the gold used for electronics that year.

Yea, that dead cat bounce got me. I was all like, "Went from 9000 back u to 12? that's a dead cat bounce." Price stabilized between 11-12 for a while, and I was all like, "Hey look, everything is okay!" and bought back in.

Exactly! Why would someone buy an ETF of just bitcoin? They could just buy bitcoin. These idiots don’t even know what an ETF is.
