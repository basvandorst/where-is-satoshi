Just started, can attest to this  statement. It's silly sometimes.

What do you care what people do with their phones or bitcoin? I understand your points but I don't see a reason to be negative. You aren't out anything, let people do what they will. Don't let the dogecoin community be right about how dick the bitcoin community has become. Dick.

Well someone is going to have to pay those prices if we ever want to see it go to the moon.

You can buy them from places like  I've never had issues with them. Just remember you don't need to purchase a while Bitcoin, you can do fractions of one and work up.

Because I'm having a heck of a time getting my raspi2 setup as a node. I bought it for that purpose. So one is coming soon!!

You need to rethink the perspective of your rude question.

What do you care what people do with their money?

No reason to be rude about people wanting to band together and help grow the Bitcoin community. If you don't like ThinkGeek, move on from this post.

The problem I'm afraid is going to happen is that people will only want to hold on to it so they can turn it back into fiat. The point of Bitcoin is to replace it. It needs to be circulated to replace common currency. If that's the way it's going to go then we would need another currency to be used daily. Why not Litecoin?

Interesting argument but from what I gather of this whole thing is that you are thinking of keeping Bitcoin like people keep gold. I don't go to my bar and trade gold for a beer. I spend a currency which is, right now, paper money or a CC. The issue of Bitcoin not replacing fiat currency is because people, like yourself, want to hoard in the hopes of increased value. You have to not be afraid to use it for day-to-day transactions.

Time travel made possible in 2025 to only go back 12 years. I see logic has become scarce in the future.

Common way is to hold the Down Volume button and Power. On stock it's that way.

Buying Bitcoin is what is making the value go up. But if everyone waits for it to hit a certain value then sell, because they want the fiat, that will make the value fall. Just like what happened in the last bubble.

It's not calculated at the last minute before adjustment.

Mine is jokersage thanks!
@_date: 2013-09-05 00:21:58
I never discouraged buying Bitcoin. I'm saying that people looking to obtain them and acting like it's a stock option is not going to help it become circulated and grow into the currency replacement it was intended to be. 
@_date: 2013-07-23 09:10:46
As long as people are willing to trade the altcoins for Bitcoins, I don't see why not to mine them. 
@_date: 2013-09-04 18:20:31
That's a problem I see. Holding into Bitcoin in hopes of trading it back into fiat for a profit. I agree, profits are nice, but you should want to use it as the currency it's meant to be. That's the only thing that will help it grow acceptance and truly become the replacement people want.

Holy freaking comments! Haven't seen a thread in this sub get so much attention in a long time.

You can order Block Erupters from Amazon for around $38. Everyone will tell you not to buy ASIC and just buy BTC. It'll take a long time to get your ROI back but I like mining. Something entrancing about seeing the light blink for every hash it solves.
