Yah. Sold my house for a profit 6 months ago and have turned that into a lot more with crypto. I'm not a full blown day trader, but I don't have to work anymore. I'll make a couple decent trades a week.

This shit has just become ridiculous anyhow. I swear I watched some rich ass kid drunk with his buddies last night on Gdax. Literally threw in a 140 BTC sell order, watched the price drop. Then took it off, put in the same 140 on the buy side, watched it go up, then put it back on the sell side.. For like 30 minutes back and forth. Charting shit for 4 1/2 hours doesn't mean anything. Shit changes when someone wants it to fucking change.

250 to 300 in each direction. Which doesn't seem like a lot. But if he wasn't screwing around and kept throwing that sell order lower and lower, or buy order for that matter, they can move the price where they please.

If this snaps back to 13k by morning, I'm gonna die laughing. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:53:44
Heh.. incest. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:52:31
I bought a few at that ATH of 5.5k. I'm fucking dying laughing right now, sipping coffee. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:41:25
For sure. This is a normal consolidation, it just happens to be coming directly after 2 days of complete bullshit. 2-3 days from now it'll all be normal. Go have a good Holiday and check back next week. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:45:59
Just about to pass out. Seeya on the other side bud. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:22:51
Agreed. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:22:27
2013.. lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:27:35
I know we're all excited about this possible crash, but if you remember to last night when coinbase and GDAX halted orders, there was 12k piled up to sell. They cleared them. What's stopping them from clearing them again before they reopen. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:16:35
Can't handle the swings eh? If we rise 4-5k in a week, it can just as easily go the opposite way. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:16:14
Yeah, I had a feeling they were definitely going this route again. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:04:41
I think there was a bit of sarcasm in the post.. I always find it funny how it went on a 12k run and right when it drops by 1 or 2k there's 400 articles about how it's a bubble and going to die. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:32:12
I agree. And there will be a crash for sure. But just saying, they cleared them last night to avoid something like this. They'll do it again. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:33:14
It's absolutely nerve racking, but that's investing. Especially in crypto. And I seriously wish I had at least one of those answers for you. What I do know, is it's going back up at some point. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:15:51
Couldn't have said it better. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:50:42
Yeah keep moving around your $200 in BTC from wallet to wallet for no apparent reason, bitching about fees. Please do. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:51:46
Maybe 30k? I bought 2 at $6300. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:56:43
It's hard not to look. But I'm with you guys. I had extra money and invested at 6k. I know it'll flow back up. Sleeping easy tonight. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:30:43
Yeah, I noticed this on GDAX also. Very interesting that BCHBTC hasn't been enabled. The past 24 hours have been hilarious. There's two sell walls for BCHBTC and BCHEUR that are not being enabled into the entire flow of this. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:31:02
Yeah, it'll happen. I think we'll see this trickle down sell off all through the night. Won't take long for BTC to find its way back up.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:29:15
I love you.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:43:05
Pretty much right around when I bought 2 at this ATH, held, then sold at 18.6k then bought back at 12k. Lmao
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:17:56
Multi year? The shit are you taking about. Bitcoin will go back up 7k in 10 days then down 11k in 8 days then back up 14k in 2 hours. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:57:29
It's possible it could have been from Roger Ver saying shit but all in all the BCH pump was overbought and unsustainable. It's just a matter of time before BCH trickles back down and BTC returns to normal. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:07:20
I bought at 7150ish. But I have money that I don't want just sitting in a bank gaining 15 cents in interest every month. Understanding it's for the long term is the gateway. Im in this for years. No sweat off my brow, I'm excited for what is to come. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:00:43
Buy bitcoin and hold the shit. Seriously. When I got in, I thought oh... 2500 is totally the top. Then it hit 3k. Then that was the top. Then. 4k. That was definitely the top. Then 5, 6, 7. If you don't have ample money to throw around, then don't get in. If you do, there is no fucking top. It's gonna keep going. I bought like 5 bitcoins at 2k and I'm living the dream. Be a man and make a decision. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:37:33
I just knew it was going to yuge. YUUUUUUGE.
