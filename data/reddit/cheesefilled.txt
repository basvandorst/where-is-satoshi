1. Picked up a book from the library. "It" by Stephen King. I already watched the movie so I know the general outline of the plot but it does have some details that weren't mentioned in the movie.
2. Biked with my dad for about 45 minutes at a forest preserve. 
3. I tried some seaweed crackers. The initial taste was good but I dislike the aftertaste. I still ate a bunch anyway :)
Sorry, this post was late. I fell asleep and then I realized I forgot to write this out.

1. Finished painting my bathroom. After I cleaned the mess I made, everything looked perfect.
2. I'm really getting into Fallout 2. At first I didn't think I would enjoy it as much as Fallout 3/New Vegas because this game is based in third person and it's turn based but the quality of the story and quests counter that.
3. I had pudding as a snack.

1. I didn't have anything much going on today so my older brother and I worked on a landscaping project together. We layed out brick edgings around some trees we have in our front yard. It took about 6 hours but it was worth it because it looks beautiful.
2. Thought about fixing a broken down car that's sitting in my  driveway. It needs to be painted and it's rusted in a few places. The tires need to be replaced and probably the engine as well. It would be a good looking car if I can restore it but I'm afraid about the cost of it.
3. I got introduced to a new cryptocurrency/community called Stellar coins. The payment procesor, Stripe, has invested in them so it seems kind of interesting.
