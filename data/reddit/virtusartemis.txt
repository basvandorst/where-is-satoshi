But when is it considered as a normal use of your income... when you will use it as a payment for 100%? Because otherwise you bought to make hodl and speculate on a raise ... which then makes it not tax free anymore

The Exchange is "Bad" because you do not CONTROL your coins. If some people of an Exchange decide to be "the bad guys" and claim they were hacked (or they really got hacked) for example but actually transferred all coins from their customers to a foreign bank-account, what can you do? They control your private keys. 
When you use multisignature wallets such as Copay (for BTC), you indeed store them on the device itself, where you, and only you, control your private keys. But yes, if you then lose your phone, you might have a problem. 
Its actually about how much trust you want to put in the Exchanges, keeping/holding your crypto's. But here such an exchange is starting to behave like a 'bank', which all know from regular money... and that is actually just what bitcoin was especially made for... to DE-centralize and not to have a 'bank' controlling it again

Read satoshis paper, inform yourself about blockchain and cryptocurrecies.25 is a start although you bought in at a high price cap, bitcoin almost doubled since last month so fingers crossed for more raising

These days u better do not mine with a normal computer... there are dedicated mining hardwares available And on top off al... ask yourself the question whether mining as an individual is still profitable? Keep energy costs in mind also.

To late? Not because BTC will be $10K today that it is to late...
You have lots of other crypto's left, as a first. And secondly, BTC won't stop on 10K...
You don't have to buy 1 BTC, just buy 0,00XXXXX...
