Because he bought in and wants others to waste hard earned money buying internet credits in the slim hope that he won’t loose it all.

Did you come up with FUD all by yourself? Who’s the broken record? Please explain the real value of bitcoin bar speculation.

What do you mean it’s not your money anymore?
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:04:25
Fair enough you see the money as spent so only spend what you can afford. Good strategy.

You best go back and read what I said where did I say I wanted it to fail?

Hope you didn’t put more than you can afford into something that realistically has zero real value.

Holly fuck man! Get out of my mind!

So you’re saying there are no new buyers of Bitcoin? Then state that what he said was false? Interesting

I’m here because I find it very interesting and entertaining what I don’t like is people shouting out it’s on sale buy buy buy. Thats only going to get people who can’t afford it badly burned.

People like OP are desperate for idiots to dump more money into a sinking ship in the hope it might float a little longer. Don’t be the one to try catch the knife this buy it while it’s on sale talk is insane.
