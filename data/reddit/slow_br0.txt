What do you mean with "backed" exactly? Bitcoin doesnt need the Chinese miners or blockstream at all. It's definitely not run by them. If they drop out the next day it wouldn't make much a difference. Blockstream is exchangeable and the mining difficulty automatically adjusts to the overall power of all miners combined. if they would try to fork or somehow manipulate the system in favour of their greed it would crash the price also to their disadvantage or their blocks just wouldn't be accepted anymore by the rest of the community.
@_date: 2016-08-14 00:43:46
i would agree that this could drastically influence the price but i highly doubt this will certainly kill bitcoin. At least because of the very likely fork that will happen like u say. Aren't "the users" already free by being concious about having the option to fork if they really want to? Maybe Lightning Network could also give a good protection against this scenario in the future, wouldn't it? do you have any information about the stance of the chinese miners about LN? isn't developing LN kinda contradictory if they're in bed with the chinese miners? ...in the end we only have an almighty blockstream controlling us all with LN, haha.

the beauty of crypto is you can give your vote by just putting your money where your mouth is. ;)
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:45:56
why not, If you think realistic crypto as a whole platform-wise doesn't need more than one store of value to work.
At the moment we are in a very speculative phase of crypto as a whole, of course, the shittiest coins are inflated more than the ones with real value. 
not to forget all the penny stock/ponzi scheme like coins which are basically controlled by scam artists who most only know about good marketing with low technical understanding.
The market easily reflects the dot-com bubble back in the 90s. everyone just wants to buy that underdog coin which was made in a small garage that has the potential for ~100x gains.

theyre the worst for years because of political and customer support fail reasons. on top they charge ridiculous fees for everything and still dont support segwit.

god bless, thanks to segwit soon decentralized platforms will make them obsolete.
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:58:15
that's no argument why it can never happen. bitcoins is solving the problem of preserving value in a decentralized way very well. I don't see any real competition on that level at the moment, there is just a lot of noise about flippening bullshit when comparing apples to pears like when comparing ETH to Bitcoin.
I still would love to hear why crypto as a whole platform-wise should need more than one very well working store of value?!
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:22:16

@_date: 2018-01-02 19:37:06
I guess it will reach 60% again pretty easy. 80-90% could be reachable as well within a year, with Wallstreet and a working LN. The very obvious altcoin bubble could pop anytime as well and I wouldn't be surprised if the money will just flow into bitcoin then.
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:55:33
Of course, it's working very well as a decentralized store of value aka digital gold. I wasn't speaking about bitcoin as a payment processor, because thats a totally different kind of problem.
to scale to visa levels or even levels where automated micro transactions for the IOT could become reality we definitely need layer 2 solutions and it looks like they will become reality pretty soon.
All the drama which bitcoin survived without any damage is easily the best argument why it works how it should.
we don't need hundreds of different proof of work coins, that's right but it looks like being the ultra-secure censorship resistant bottom layer of a decentralized economy is bitcoins true killer app.
there is no coin that is as secure as bitcoin to be digital gold. ASICs are even a bonus for security and as you can see many new competitors are jumping on the ASIC mining train re-decentralizing mining. Moore's law seems to be also slowing down a lot recently which will help a lot as well to re-decentralize mining.
energy inefficiency is a myth, watch this video-&gt;
on chain scaling for payment processing for everyday use cases and IOT use cases in a pow system are bullshit I won't deny that.
Please have a little imagination. the internet wasn't built in one day based on a single perfect solution solving all problems at once. it works like it does today because it was built in layers.
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:50:34
Real decentralization is the single most important thing in crypto, indeed. 
But I think its also important to have a very rock solid and strongly decentralized foundation to refer to when expressing value in that space. That's bitcoins aim I guess and it looks to me like there is no real competitor for that until now.

thats true and its great like that. LN/federated peg/atomic swap compatible blockchains will connect with each other through lightning network and other smart contracts making the money flow of crypto as whole more liquid and decentralized.
to me, that's the best argument why bitcoin will become the bottom layer in crypto for storing value aka digital gold because of its ultrasecure POW.

its super delusional to believe that "most people play by the rules of the society".
As a very easy example, almost everyone i know already took illegal drugs.
Almost everyone I know would commit a crime against the government like tax evasion for their own benefit if the chances to get caught tend to 0. Nobody loves the big brother. the only reason why most people stick to the rules is because they are forced to as there are mechanisms to obey and control their actions in many ways. 
There is just no way to put in mechanisms to control the use of bitcoin in a similar way like fiat.
btw there are pretty easy ways to hide your bitcoins in a way so nobody knows how many you really have and you still have the option to prove that you just have a lesser amount in your wallet like pressing the silent panic button on your alarm system.

1st question no. 2nd yes. 
Imagine LN is like a protocol or app running on bitcoin. but in order to build powerful apps like lightning we needed to fix malleability first via segwit. 
well, a very less powerful version lightning would also work without segwit theoretically but it would have to be build around malleability which was a serious flaw in the bitcoin protocol that made the implementation of Layer 2 applications a lot harder. 
expect more Layer 2 apps and even layer 3 in the next years!

@_date: 2017-02-15 18:18:05
maybe they just want to profit from the fees a little longer. for me the most reasonable explanation for their iffy stance on that issue is they dont want to scale bitcoin at all as long as the extra gross which they get through the fees is big enough to justify a prolonged stallment of bitcoins overall scaling. maybe for them it just seems at the moment that this stallment isnt affecting the price significantly enough to actively hasten the process for their benefit.
@_date: 2017-02-25 15:49:58
pray that they either realize that adopting segwit increases their revenue by far more than the fees do short time or that mining gets banned completely in china.

u are ignoring the very likely case that most of the opposing BU side is an ilusion created through lobbyists work big time. and the miners with their iffy stance towards that whole issue seem to just like the stallment because of the extra fees for some nice short term extra roi. thats how companies work. they would be dumb to give it up faster than necessary when they have full control on that decision. after reading a ton of posts regarding this issue this seems the only sane explanation to me.
@_date: 2017-02-26 14:15:12
do you want to imply that the majority wants a hard fork at the moment or did you mean that in general? in general thats definitely a nice thing if necessary but we are far away from that. if we dont achieve consensus at least on segwit we will most likely get no consensus on anything at all.

the only thing which is logical if BU becomes a thing(what still isn't logical at all) is to switch all your money to an altcoin or to fiat instead of burning your money in the controversial hardfork crash coin. btw nobody here is interested in what you prefer personal as long as you don't give real arguments why that's the case. why don't you just talk to yourself instead. the result would be the same.

@_date: 2017-03-10 19:29:19
it's "unlimited" right? please explain. but its still a hardfork, isnt it? 
as a hardfork it definitely will stay controversial as long as it's not backed by at least 95% or smth. like that. maybe even that isn't enough if the centralisation of mining gets worse. bitcoin will crash hard when they fork with lower support than that. you dont believe me? if you think the whole market will blindly follow the miners that's laughable.
@_date: 2017-03-21 14:06:41
waiting 10 minutes will never be a convenient confirmation time for all the real payment processing mainstream use cases like buying something at the supermarket even if it costs only 1cent of fees.
when i want to transfer $1k i mostly wont care much if it costs 1cent or a dollar or if it takes an hour or a day. every merchant would still love to pay the fees for you even if its $5 if he can avoid using smth. like paypal instead.
nevertheless if done properly there still can be very secure LN implementations with almost no risk even if you put these amounts of money into it.

define majority support. if you mean the overall userbase and/or every individual who is working for a company whose success is tied to bitcoin this won't happen in a million years except you force them and then a very lot will jump off that sinking ship. don't you have any real arguments except referring to SN like he was Jesus? even for the extremely unlikely scenario BUcoin gets listed as the original bitcoin on at least half of the major exchanges the price will crash very hard. BU can only lose. the question is if we all are going to lose. 100%, I like many other hodlers will sell all my coins and move it back to fiat or a completely different coin before this can happen.

@_date: 2017-02-15 15:16:16
well, it seems the opposite is more likely the case not for a reason but because of a ton of reasons. i bet one bitcoin this will never be the case. there is almost no serious non-chinese company that openly spoke out support for BU. they either keep a neutral stance or they openly support segwit. lets put the money where your mouth is if you really believe in that implementation.;) btw for the theoretical very unlikely case that a hardfork to BU with the majority of hash power will happen, any sane person would switch his/her money to a different coin instead of letting their money burn in that kind of very controversial event. so one way or another there are a lot of people who won't support BU even if it becomes the "main chain".
@_date: 2017-02-25 18:26:13
it couldnt be more ridiculous. we just need more quality journalistic work putting everything together at the same time to show the people whats really behind BU. i mean how can a reddit admin really take anyone from /btc seriously and do anything what he/she suggests or demands if he knows what's going on.
@_date: 2017-02-26 21:47:37
i guess companies in general love inflated short-term yields a lot more for as long as their long-term yields aren't in a very obvious danger which doesn't seem to be the case at the moment. I believe they just like the current situation more that "officially beeing in control" of the development because it would be too obvious for the market if they try to stay on kind of the same point from scaling perspective which gives them the highest yield. the real users would for sure fork away with a pow system that makes their asics useless. somehow I still want to believe or my gut feeling says that the big china-miners "just" like the stallment in general and BU is only the first best excuse for it which comes to their mind. so i kinda hope they aren't completely in the same bed.
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:08:31
then why isn't he signaling for segwit while signaling for BU at the same time? UASF is pure theory. they already wanted their fork before that thing came up which still is only pure theory and nobody really seems to know if it's even possible. BU supporters didn't just started signaling to make the BU fork happen only because of this very far fetched argument. you must be joking. if its a 75% threshold or 51% or just now i don't see much difference. i even read the 75% is only a handshake agreement by mining pools. can you confirm this? or is that 75% hard-coded? especially when you consider the distribution of mining power per individual who is in control these are extremely low numbers and every hard fork will be a controversial and pushed one with that kind of "threshold".
@_date: 2017-03-14 00:40:31
As you know they also try infest this sub all the time. I thought many people can save alot of time which they use to answer them and move on to just ignore them when the sticky makes most answers to them obsolete.

newspapers love gossip. i guess very technical stuff about bitcoin would target only a small audience in general while political/personal stuff is much easier to sell. 
funny that you think about /btc first. i kinda gave it up to fight in that echo chamber. but i guess its a good place to collect evidence which we maybe should hand over to some good journalists. 
i was talking more about the comment sections of several media outlets. the shills are everywhere. even on german sites like  most of the times you find many of the shills at once creating some made up conversations with everything perfectly timed to suggest the reader in the end that BU is a very good idea. feels very creepy to read. kinda like reading a comic where a story gets pushed much too easy and too fast. 
normally i dont hate people but if i had to choose one it would be him or better said everyone lying on purpose to push this filthy agenda. i really don't want kind of the last thing which gives me hope for society to be crippled in that way by these kind of people. you made a double post btw.

why couldn't it be? with LN + Bitcoin you can have everything at once and many other things like for example automated micro transactions for several purposes on the internet what would create a whole new market.
Like A. Antonopoulos said bitcoin could be the internet of money with a ton of different protocols running on top of it.

i never said he's bribing people. I also didn't say u said that the other miners don't pass the fees. why are you putting words into my mouth which I never said? 
my question is why did he wait until now to kinda pass the fees which he still isn't doing accordingly because the estimated average fees are expected to be 11% of block reward and they are obviously growing. 
so this is just misleading marketing which looks very much like he's trying to make people think he is the welfare what he is definitely not.

“If the Custodian, in consultation with the Sponsor, is unable to make a conclusive determination about which Bitcoin Network has the greatest cumulative computational difficulty after forty-eight (48) hours, or determines in good faith that this is not a reasonable criterion upon which to make a determination, the Custodian will support the Bitcoin Network which it deems in good faith is most likely to be supported by a greater number of users and miners.”

@_date: 2017-03-07 13:15:40
well, for example he says that he doesn't block segwit but at the same time he literally contributes to blocking it by supporting and actively pushing BU. you got me totally wrong. I believe people are bad for what they do or support and not the other way round. easy example: it's obviously very shady to push a controversial hardfork of rushed and not well tested software hence putting several billion dollars that aren't theirs at risk. what about peer review? its overrated, right?
@_date: 2017-03-08 12:13:18
thats a complete joke, when the BU supporters really would be at least "ok" with it they would signal activation now or at least show will that they are working on it. it wont reach consensus when they dont signal for it it temselves.
i can guarantee, they would get their increased effective blocksize alot faster that way. but hey, first lets cry a little more about full blocks, right?? 
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:19:40
well, I still don't know any person in the bitcoin business who contradicted himself as many times like he did and who is in such a powerful position at the same time. 
maybe he should say it then that he will increase it, otherwise it's really bad marketing according to the current market situation. 
well, ok, maybe I was a little fast with judging and calling it shady. it is still not nearly as shady as the development of BU. nobody really knows what to expect from it in the future. a very huge risk. especially when we have an excellent allrounder solution from a company with the technically proven finest developer who exist in blockchain-land. of course i am suspicious in the same way on other stuff he does/supports which is bitcoin related.
@_date: 2017-03-13 10:32:01
19,9% is very far away from beeing an extreme minority. especially if you consider the centralisation of mining. it could easily still be the economic majority. even if all big china miners collude to force a fork upon the rest and attack the minority the sane non BU supporting people and especially the genious core developers could get creative to protect them to an 51% attack after that kind of event and maybe also fork to reduce the difficulty. leaving the miners with almost no  userbase. iam very sure most of the non chinese exchanges would still love to list BU as an alt then if they wanted to add that shady coin at all.
@_date: 2017-03-28 00:05:28

well if we would sink to their level we would have to lie and defame people personally but we don't need this. Creating awareness by just offering the truth is not their game.
Seriously, people who are new to bitcoin and don't spend alot of time on Reddit or Bitcointalk could easily think that BU and Core are legit competitors on the same level if they only follow the mainstream media outlets. Many mainstream media outlets seem to love that story of the split "community". And somehow they always interview "Bitcoin Jesus" to get answers on that topic for example...

maybe we just have to be less silent to solve that problem. shouldn't we aim to become as loud as educated at the moment? how else can we fight this? this is definitely an information war. we should hang a big sign that can not be down talked too easy by their standard bullshit on every newsoutlet which has a minimum drive to reflect the truth. there shouldn't be left much room for their shitty disinformation campaign on all relevant platforms without getting a appropriate response refuting their bullshit. because we actually are the majority this should be easily viable if we just care enough. maybe it would be also a good idea ask for the help of big companies like SatoshiLabs to make a statement that they are aware of what is really happening.

because having segwit activated and maybe also schnorr signatures will change the whole situation alot. when its still necessary after that and they dont have any better solutions for further scaling of course they will propose a very well planned fork for a blocksize increase i guess.

Wrong. Non-mining validating full nodes were part of bitcoin from the beginning. 
That satoshis vision argument is still stupid. Jesus wouldn't like it if you make ill-considered arguments like that. ;)
The greatest strength of bitcoin is its decentralization and thus its robustness against any kind of attacker who wants to highjack the protocol to change it according to his taste. Many different entities from different parts of the industry and of course the users are part of the process making bitcoin what it is and giving it value.
There is zero reason to give the decision making right about what bitcoin should be exclusively to the miners and a few other companies signing a piece of paper behind closed doors. Except you don't like decentralization. Well, then you must kind of hate bitcoin in general.

@_date: 2017-08-19 22:09:54
supporting a coin doesn't automatically mean it will be traded as original bitcoin.
As you can see yourself they used the term "likely" for a reason because it's just insane to just instantly follow the miners and let them decide what is bitcoin according to their mood of the day.
it would be almost as stupid for the miners to mine a coin that's a lot less valuable than the original bitcoin. Hash power follows the economic majority and NOT vice versa. Many different coins/forks have already proven that.
you can even see the hash power coming and leaving with rises and falls of the price of a coin.
nevertheless, it's just an agreement. A piece of paper worth the same like a handshake between people deciding about the destiny of a lot of other people who aren't even involved in the agreement. I don't see why it should be more binding than any other failed agreement from the cryptospace.

@_date: 2017-08-23 16:40:16
So there is no absolute truth?! really? wow, mindblowing!?!? 
I think it's pretty easy to see through the situation: If there is one absolute moral ground of bitcoin it is its decentralized nature and the trust you are putting in it. If something is obviously hurting it, it is very likely bad for bitcoin.
The worst precedent you can imagine for a decentralized network of any kind is someone or a few thinking they are the gatekeepers of the network being able to patronize the rest of the network behind closed doors and thus highjacking it. 
Aside from many other good reasons against 2x, this one certain fact already says it all about the nonexistent moral grounds of it.
@_date: 2017-08-19 19:07:51
that's true and that's the reason why most exchanges WONT list this new extremely toxic shitcoin until there are proper solutions to protect their customers and themselves. in the meanwhile bitcoin will be just bitcoin. very unlikely this new 2x coin will become original bitcoin on all the exchanges that comes with no replay protection. Even if it would come with proper replay protection by default it's still unlikely. no contentious fork will ever have a real chance to become original bitcoin because of it being contentious and that's one of bitcoins greatest strengths.
@_date: 2017-08-28 12:57:26
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:33:18
Could you then explain please why segwit can increase the "block weight" without a hard fork but the 2x part needs a not backwards compatible fork?
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:25:04
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:11:17
I wonder whats the real story behind that picture. Who are the other guys?
@_date: 2017-08-19 01:22:17
segwit would have passed anyway by default in 2018. please, don't talk shit, with segwit the ceiling is almost twice as high and very likely a lot of the load on the network will vanish because of lightning-transactions.
letting the 2x fork pass this year is the worst precedent you can imagine for bitcoin. it's implying the protocol can be changed at any time by a few who think they are the gatekeepers of  bitcoin and especially by deciding behind closed doors. 
a 2mb hard fork in about a year would be fine for everybody to update their node etc. is it really necessary? I don't know for sure, but very likely not with lightning very soon and schnorr signatures being probably ready as well within the next 12 month. 
let's see how things work out and decide then and make it thoroughly planned. segwit is great on chain scaling and more will definitely come when the time is right. there is zero reason to buy that big blockers narrative about them panicking because they can't buy on chain coffee.
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:30:55

they are free to mine or create any coin they like at any time. Yet, you can force nobody to buy it.
@_date: 2017-08-19 18:52:30
what exactly do you want to say? people will sell their coins only because the network is slow for a while? most of the holders won't even care a little bit.. the difficulty will readjust soon. it would not even be easy to sell at the beginning. nevertheless, the money flow coming from the new coin back to the original slow coin would work with no problems. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:01:39

core was explicitly uninvited from that behind closed doors meeting about bitcoin scaling. letting the 2x fork happen is kind of the worst predecent you can imagne for bitcoin. it implies that the protocol can be changed in a recklessly fast way by a few who think they are the gatekeepers of bitcoin. thats a spit in the face of everyone who values the decentralization of bitcoin. anyway, the benefits of 2x are still very questionable...
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:13:46
sounds like its already official that the 2x fork will be an altcoin no matter with or without replay protection. thats how its right. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 18:01:05
i doubt it that coinbase is planning to list the 2x fork as original bitcoin. more likely they will just announce that they will list the 2x altcoin half a year later when the replay protection issue has been solved. voila, they kind of support it.
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:37:32
100% yes, it should never be easy. Loosening bitcoins technical robustness to the decisions of a few who think they are the gatekeepers of bitcoin and can make very rushed technical changes mostly based on grounds of political chitchat is basicly like giving up bitcoins greatest strength.

Very unlikely that Coinbase will do such a fast switch to the newly created altcoin trying to sell it as bitcoin. especially when it's a created in a very contentious way like it will be if the current situation won't change in a very significant way very soon. 
Coinbase would just never operate like that. Extremely unlikely. They especially learned through ETC that it's a huge risk to list a newly created alt very fast. Especially when it has no replay protection. Meanwhile bitcoin will be just bitcoin on Coinbase and all the major exchanges who very likely all hate to be responsible for the risks coming with that coin.
If the 2x chain only exists(if they dare to create it at all) for one day as an altcoin parallel to bitcoin thats only traded on small risk taking exchanges, that will easily be enough to assure that it will never get the place of bitcoin on the major exchanges.

there are many altcoins that have very tiny fees, quick transactions, better tech at the current state, a more promising future, better  decentralisation!!!!, a very much better reputation and greater merchant adoption. Does Bcash even have merchant adoption except Bitmain for his own products?  
It's easy to see that Bcash's only real purpose is to shit on Bitcoin's name and get pump and dumped relying mostly on Bitcoin FUD.
Maybe the FUDsters and trader's will pump it even more but you're completely insane if you think you should buy Bcash to hold it as a safe haven for your wealth or to pay for real things with it.

if there is one thing that is actively "blocking" content distribution on this planet it is intellectual property law. the advancement of the original idea of a truly decentralized internet is inevitable. any business which is not sustainable on that basis for content distribution has to either adapt or gtfo long term.

debunked? your points do not contradict what I said at all.
there are still millions of users paying billions for premium content on the internet. Spotify alone has ~50 million premium subscribers. Netflix has ~90million. do you want to tell me that's not a very significant part of the market?
there are many other file sharing services very similar to uploaded  and combined they easily also have xx million paying users. moreover the users of these services are very used to change their provider because that market changes very fast.

90 million netflix users paying ~10$ per month is almost 10billion which got paid for premium content solely on netflix per year. and this is still only the tip of the iceberg of the market for paid premium content on the internet. it's a well working and still growing business model. you debunked nothing. youtube is great but thats no argument why the the market for premium content isnt justified or has no future near term. only because there are people not willing or able to pay that doesnt mean there is no demand. i dont get it what you are trying to say with that.

so what? there would be only reason for a pow change in case of a 51% attack. the ability to do a 51% attack still does not put u in charge of the attacked chain or smth. like that.

u/jstolfi is easily the most dishonest person on reddit who is making negative comments about bitcoin on a regular basis by using the most sophisticated language. 
He keeps spreading the worst cliches like bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme and it's worth 0 because it's not backed by anything and at the same time he is spreading pseudo support for bitcoin xt, unlimited, 2x, bcash, satoshis vision was to let the miners decide everything or whatever is the /btc flavour of the month.
+At the same time he's shitposting on /buttcoin about people getting their bitcoins hacked like there is nothing on earth that amuses him more.
Just read some of his comments and you will realize bitcoin as a whole must be his final nemesis in life or something like that and that he is willing to say whatever fits for the situation as long as it is bad for bitcoin.

I reread it. Yes, its not about me. Maybe it just seemed to me like you are putting words into my mouth because you never answered my question.
I understand and i agree.
Yet, forcing a hardfork upon the community still isn't justified because someone is "forcing" status quo which isn't even the case.
Why are you even mentioning it?
especially because we already got segwit activated that includes an onchain capacaty increase. Schnorr signatures will give some more soon and everything without the risks coming with a contentious hardfork.

Ethereum is more about the platform and not the ether token. Any successful killer dapp on ethereum if it will become a thing at all will very likely also accept bitcoin to pay for it's service. 
The platform itself looks promising, i wont deny that even though there is alot of work for the devs ahead but this certain token running on it definitely looks overvalued to me at the moment.

I never said that they are the bad guys in general just because they want on chain scaling or because i disagree with it now. There is nothing wrong with on chain scaling in general. 
Your own rhetoric sucks the most if it depends on putting words into someone others mouth.
I was just asking you a question implying that the end doesn't justify the means. Trying to force a contentious hardfork on the community by all means is very bad for bitcoin. Don't you understand? Do you disagree?

especially in this context its totally not superslow and not inconvinient in comparison to the other payment options. please read the first post again and use your brain before you post the standard bitcoin opposer die-hard stuff. btw once you are educated enough(still not much), bitcoin is very easy to handle for an internet merchant. especially in this case and also if you are sick of paying these exorbitant paypal fees youre just dumb if you do not offer bitcoin as an alternative. a standard wiretransfer will still most of the times be one day slower..

50-100€ still isn't much for what it does if you compare it to the fees of banks as its a one-time investment like a safe to store your cash at home. a safe would still be a lot more expensive and it would be a very lot more of a hassle to set it up to basically fulfill the same function. 
I still don't see how this is any more complex than 7th-grade math or setting up iTunes and connecting it to your apple-id to transfer music from your pc to your iPhone or smth. like that.

I never said that I or Andreas does know the truth but the facts we have still aren't in his favour. yet, it's seems very much more likely that the opposite is the case. The only thing I know for very sure is that he's not a trustworthy person on any bitcoin-related stuff that gets discussed in public.
I know that he said that that he doesn't have a problem with eliminating asicboost. that shouldnt be a surprise as one way or another it would be wise for him to not oppose it directly. 
the only thing that really matters is that fixing asicboost could change the grounds for the scaling debate and it's not worth the risk to ignore it because if its true its very likely an immense negative factor. (or it can at least become one)
well, we will see how it plays out when the BIP for the fix is ready.

I never paid more than 5 cents(most of the time less than 1cent) for a transaction this year and segwit adoption is still growing. schnorr signatures will add more room for transactions very soon as well. anyway, lightning seems to already work pretty well even though it's still in early beta stages.

@_date: 2017-05-17 15:51:00
It's A HUGE issue. 
You cannot destroy the reputation of a company that has already reached kind of the lowest possible floor of the industry reputation wise.
The reputation of BITMAIN in a nutshell: "fuck the press of your company if you want fuck"

you should write a letter to this miner called Jihan Wu
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:44:24
you mean long on fees and probably ASIC-boost.

will there be an ICO?

i always liked Vensaur the most.
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:16:00
totally true, for me that's a different problem but I guess there are also very good solutions for that like Tor, VPN, etc.
@_date: 2017-05-31 01:16:31
i will maybe take a shot if one manages to finally develope a popular dapp with real practical usage that can only run on ethereum.
@_date: 2017-05-17 17:52:51
proven facts strongly suggest that Jihan Wu is using covert ASIC-boost more likely than not. 
he already showed often enough that he has no moral problems with forcing his own will onto the rest of the community. 
now about the ASIC-boost thing; he says that he's not using it just to be fair even if he already put major effort in making everything ready to be able to use it exclusively?! pretty hard to believe.
for sure it's hard to prove because that's the point of using covert ASIC-boost but it's definitely not only a conspiracy.
@_date: 2017-05-08 23:18:57
instructions unclear, bought Doge
@_date: 2017-05-18 01:59:18
how does he risk losing anything by using covert ASIC boost? his reputation is already garbage so what can he lose?
@_date: 2017-05-31 01:34:50
so he thinks asicboost is a good thing because its patented or what?!  lol.
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:06:59
predictions? seems more like a collection of facts related to the current state of the art.

DISCLAIMER: BE AWARE OF THE SHILLS! THEY ARE MORE MOTIVATED THAN EVER AND SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY FOR REDDIT GOLD AT THE MOMENT.
@_date: 2017-05-23 16:51:46
because ASICBOOST could be very likely a reason why segwit doesn't get adopted by this one particular miner that owns more hashing power than anyone else. Even if the chances are small that he is using it,(yet, the signs still say it's more likely the opposite) it doesn't seem worth the risk to not fix it if it can be done with a non-controversial soft fork that seems very likely to get adopted fast with no resistance.
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:10:17
if it's true that anything that is written for Ethereum also runs on Rootstock with no drawbacks and also faster, why not run on both?! wouldn't this only show even more the true strength of open decentralized projects? ETH promises great stuff, I don't want to deny that but there are still no pracitcal and popular use cases to show its true power and advantage over other similar projects. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 01:24:43

whatever promise they are hoping for to be fulfilled, they can only hope in good will for it. anything else would be undermining bitcoins decentralized nature in a very severe way. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 23:14:29
why should the price take a nosedive because anyone forks off the network by intention? anyone can do that anyday if he/she likes to.

for hodl
@_date: 2018-04-04 23:00:15
but you still don't need it just to try it out. for small amounts, bread wallet on ios, for example, is perfectly fine and as easy to use. but sure my 66years old mother wouldn't be able to even download an app on her phone without me having to explain it to her step by step first.
to be honest I don't see much upside in improving wallets to get tech illiterate people like her more into bitcoin. the interfaces of the easiest wallets and coinbase aren't more complex than the PayPal interface. in fact, the PayPal interface isn't even that easy to understand when you want to manage recurring payments for example.
but sure, when I ask my mother to register on PayPal she wouldn't even trust them without me explaining to her first how it works and how it connects to her bank account step by step even though she doesn't need to know that to use it.

@_date: 2017-05-12 19:37:29
Sorry for the confusion, I was talking about a fix that solely addresses ASIC-boost. Is there a specific one on the way? If I understand everything right, it's a lot more important to fix this first at least for strategic reasons if we want segwit to get activated anytime soon!?
@_date: 2017-07-19 00:29:28
Only because certain pump n dumpers exist and do affect the price partially it doesn't mean automatically that there can't be a real value at stake as well. A very well working trustless decentralized money system definitely has real value, it's undeniable. Bitcoin as a way to transfer value over the globe already easily beats billion dollar companies like western union by light years in many ways.
I am sorry I have to say but the message you are trying to deliver is as bad as your grammar.
@_date: 2017-07-05 13:08:23
he is definitely not a poor guy. he's a monster full of lies driven by greed. he truly deserves to get witch hunted until he stops any work related to bitcoin. we seriously live in a society supporting this type of guys. lying out of greed is pretty much normal these days. the real problem is not especially he who does need a cure.
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:23:20
"a patent on how to abuse it covertly" 
Nah, thanks, I'd rather just pay with my inflation save Bitcoins for the service any of these long-awaited Ethereum killer dapps as soon as they will become reality if they will become reality at all. Seems like Bitcoin could activate segwit several times until then. ;)
@_date: 2017-07-23 10:36:54
they will split(fork off) by design no matter what.
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:08:47
if they didn't got already scared away by the front page of reddit it shouldn't matter any more.
@_date: 2017-07-16 01:17:19
I totally feel u. i never used coinbase and i very likely never will. yet, iam still hoping that segwit will just activate one way or another before 1.8 and the 2x part will just get swept under the carpet where it belongs afterwards. I believe its maybe better to let the miners fork first and just counter it with a pow change so "btc new pow" has the highest chance to get supported as the original bitcoin by the economic majority. like a gunpoint at the miners for the case they want to do smth. very stupid.
@_date: 2017-07-18 22:17:52

unlikely the fork part of segwit2x will happen anyway. the exchanges would just list it as an alt. this obscure agreement isnt binding at all. but still nice to see that it leads to segwit getting finally activated.
@_date: 2017-07-25 20:15:10

@_date: 2017-05-30 13:58:52
not really, the monopoly of hashing power is that big. a very very few people strongly connected to Jihan Wu do own the hashing power not signaling for segwit.
@_date: 2017-05-31 01:29:28
keep it normal
@_date: 2017-05-18 17:00:59
what?? Let me guess: you are becoming nervous because you can't buy your next cup of coffee with bitcoin because your made up cypherpunk ego doesn't let you use fiat cash anymore? but at the same time, you believe that waiting for a 10 minute block to confirm is perfectly fine for that case?

@_date: 2017-06-27 14:13:37
as far as I understand, the point is that the BIP148 chain will remain the one which is listed as bitcoin on the exchanges as default and the miners not upgrading will be locked out on a different coin and thus creating an altcoin. Exchanges would need to actively embrace the miner's coin and  ̶u̶̶p̶̶g̶̶r̶̶a̶̶d̶̶e̶  downgrade their software afterwards to make it the other way round.

then what is fiat money backed by if not faith? i still need faith in a counterparty redeeming my money or faith in a system forcing it to. it only works if you share the same faith. how can you say its meaningless? its the most important thing underlying every society.

@_date: 2017-06-27 15:53:22
read again what I wrote, it's not contradictory to supporting segwit2x as it only refers to the technical aspects of the activation of the segwit part via BIP148.
@_date: 2017-06-20 20:57:10
must be a very good sign.
@_date: 2017-06-19 01:04:49
but why? why should he play all in or nothing. that's no sustainable business model especially if your business is thriving very well anyway.
@_date: 2017-06-11 15:43:22
as far as i know they cooperate with bitcoin.de and offer instant swaps from bitcoin to fiat and vice versa for a very low fee. what else can u ask for as a bitcoin user!?
@_date: 2017-06-05 01:59:26
the way you are talking about uasf and segwit like it is the same thing clearly shows you have either no clue what you are talking about or you are just trying to manipulate opinions, mr. serious big blocker. ;)
@_date: 2017-06-05 02:27:57
at least the owners of these pools are in bed with Jihan if he doesn't own them himself. if proven or not theyre pushing for the same bullshit agenda trying to centralize bitcoin by running bitcoin ec and blocking segwit. what a surprising coincidence that almost all of them do mine empty blocks at the same rate. ;)
@_date: 2017-06-23 15:44:26
Just HODL your precious bitcoins. That's the way they are telling you that don't like how you treat them.
@_date: 2017-06-25 15:47:32
I also dont really get it. As far as I understand it segwit as a softfork only puts JUSTIFIED pressure on the rest of the network because the new transactions are inherently better on a technical level for the network as a whole. I guess that's a good thing, isnt it!?
@_date: 2017-06-14 11:25:22
hes very likely already using it
@_date: 2017-06-14 11:51:03
thank you, jihan, for clarifying how important it is to support UASF.
@_date: 2017-06-19 12:51:28
if bip148 would result in an "imposter" altcoin splitting from the "original only true bitcoin" then he would have zero reasons to fear it and waste a huge amount of resources to fight it. why not just let the people trade their new shitcoin!? if it's the coin that will be traded on most of the big exchanges as bitcoin then he would be literally destroying bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-11 13:48:46
who is even upvoting this?
@_date: 2017-06-19 00:57:28
why should he want destroy to bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-19 00:10:59
very likely not as they have a high change to provoke an emergency pow change and thus ruin their business completely.
