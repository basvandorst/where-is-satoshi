A little, but there's no difference between multiple outputs sent to one address and one output sent to each of many addresses. Your campaign should be against P2SH overall if that is the stance you want to take.

Every decent wallet does this. There's no extra "use" of the block chain between using a change address and not. The block chain doesn't know what addresses are and couldn't give a shit if you reuse them or not. You are conversely sacrificing your privacy and security by doing avoiding change addresses. Before attempting to tell people how to optimize their use of bitcoin, maybe you should become acquainted with the technology first.

What, like 10 apps aren't on your platform? Who cares. They have hundreds of thousands.

You can lock data for at least a specific amount of time by making the assumption a puzzle takes at least n time to solve, and the key is released by the solution to the lock box being found.

The comment about the DOS rules still stands in that case.  n1m6, n2m5, n3m4 are the maximums if this is actually true (and you can't assume the network will have updated to a new version).

No, look on the mailing list for Peter Todd's timelock. It's a operation that takes a short amount of time to create, but takes a significantly longer time to solve.

Have you looked at the fees paid by large transactions? They almost never pay the correct fee because they're trying to combine 0.0001 BTC in 1000 dust outputs.

You really think we are "running out" of 2^160 addresses? (We're not).

You can't have n &gt; 3 in transactions due to standardness rules. For uncompressed keys (the most common) you can't exceed n1m6, n2m5, n3m4 due to harder DOS rules on the size of a transaction. Pretty much anything other than n1m2 n2m2 n2m3 n3m3 is unusable in Bitcoin today.

Forced to surrender? It's cute that you think anybody forced their hand.

It's still an impact due to DOS limit sizes. There's no reason for people to be using uncompressed keys except due to laziness. Blame blockchain.info and other wallets for not bothering to update their signature libraries. It's a trivial change.

I said it's completely undesirable, I didn't say it wasn't allowed. Actually getting a 100KB transaction into a block is pretty unlikely.

Usually it's anti-DOS. I don't know the particular justifications for these rules, but having people shoot around kilobyte sized transactions isn't desirable.
