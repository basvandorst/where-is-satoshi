Yes I think you are right. Haven't used truthcoin, but have attempted to use Auger. All I can say, is they have some lovely videos.
@_date: 2015-06-30 23:10:27
lol, awesome!

The decision makers are not people who own wallets, but the people who mine and the people who write the code. People who own wallets are just users

I hope it works out for them, as they seem quite grounded and interested in the legal and mainstream applications, which is where I think bitcoin needs to gradually go. It will take time

There was at the start!

poor peter, outclassed and knew it, I think.
@_date: 2014-12-18 16:06:40
that would be very generous of them

@_date: 2015-05-26 21:29:35

there was just a very hard block... took 1hour 55 to pass. nothing to do with bitstamp
@_date: 2015-01-17 16:37:43
That's just silly. You then have 3 different things that could get stolen. They only need to steal one of them. I think better to have several different wallets with keys stored securely in different locations to reduce your risk
@_date: 2015-01-17 20:16:58
You should totally do that )
@_date: 2015-01-04 12:44:52
i disagree with this article, There are loads of advantages to having a fund which can be hedged rather than buying BTC directly. Also avoiding plain old security risks
@_date: 2015-01-17 08:07:45
just a troll. dont feed him

I cant wait up an hour... i need to go to beddie byes. Any chance of a sneak preview?
@_date: 2015-01-17 08:09:33
no. new dollars are issued all the time
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:31:09
just a joke, relax
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:55:09
Those advantages could all be realised alongside a high btc price, via altcoins

instead of whining, douche, why don't you up vote so its at the top of the list. Then they'll see it.
@_date: 2015-05-26 18:51:19
was going to say exactly the same thing... ill upvote u!

Good luck with the IAMA. Loved the book, thanks for open sourcing it
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:46:05
oh cool... i'm unblurring your addresses )
@_date: 2015-01-04 13:01:36
i upvoted you too... its a good analysis and have not seen it being challenged
@_date: 2015-07-17 20:18:28
i upvoted!

The greeks need more Euro, not digital tokens. They are very unlikely to swap the scarce euro they have for a volatile btc. If they were worried themselves about the Euro, they would buy USD. Only reason they would buy BTC is if they thought the whole global currency were about to collapse, which is pretty unlikely, or they wanted to escape capital controls (too late for that).
@_date: 2015-07-02 21:38:25
I was going to make a joke about 'defaulting', but then ran out of energy. Bad timing alright. Good luck anyway
@_date: 2015-07-05 12:05:08
very long preamble. I think you could cut all the stuff about Aristotle, its padding. 3/4 way you get into the actual subject of how a spanish person might theoretically deal with pending capital controls. It sounds to me like you are advising them to their money, transfer mechanism been bitcoin, to someone else to hold for them. Lot of trust required for that approach. Why not just hold bitcoin?

any effect that grexit would have, has being felt already. Capital has flown and not via bitcoin.

looks very interesting, thanks for posting

with a state lottery, they are selling a dream, of a life changing amount. Those who enter are not concerned with the odds, they are simply hoping and dreaming of something that will change their mundane existence. With this, you have a very low odds game, if you enter enough times you will come out pretty much even... so.. why bother?
