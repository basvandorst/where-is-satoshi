What sort of price changes if any, happened at the last halvening?

Phone charger is more difficult as you would need to build a whole OS and tcp stack on it in order to access the blockchain.

He's going to end up snitching on the owner of all that money anyhow.  You can imagine the kind of jail time that he's facing.

They'll venture into every avenue that's most profitable and legal for them to be involved in.

Wow, I never heard of the "internet" denomination before

Coming preloaded is a good idea but eventually those coins would run out and the workflow of the devices self mining behind the scenes instead of the difficulties of manually reloading is much more user friendly.

Ah ok.  Thanks for the info, that must be what I was unaware of.

I would just wait for an a major SEC approved bitcoin ETF that lists on major exchanges like NYSE or Nasdaq.  The Winklevoss one seems like the nearest one to being approved.
@_date: 2015-10-09 03:14:48
Yep, more expensive because of the mining ASIC that is not yet commodity....
@_date: 2015-10-25 00:09:24
That'll require a lot of governmental approvals and corporate buy-in to make this even remotely possible.  I suspect that if there's a push to make these type of machine to machine microtransactions feasible, governments would be more interested in making fiat currency transactions cheaper and faster rather than promoting friendlier laws for cryptocurrencies.

The two concepts are very much tied in from a user perspective.  On boarding new users onto bitcoin is a very time consuming and expensive endeavor, mainly because of having to deal with the existing banking systems, expensive cash atms, etc.   To a normal user it might be too daunting to even bother.  However if the smart devices I buy automatically mine and handle these micropayments that's a *much* better workflow and more user friendly.

If that ETF ever gets SEC approval and trades on big exchanges like NYSE or Nasdaq, I can't imagine that we wouldn't be on a straight march back to $1000 bitcoin in no time.

Isn't that generally pretty hard to predict? Doesn't the size of the mining pool,  current difficulty, mining competition, etc come into account? 
@_date: 2015-10-09 01:46:55
Not sure why you're being up voted for your bad math...

Can you link to the post you're referring too?

What's the most popular one for C/C++ and Java? 
@_date: 2015-10-19 21:25:11
Well excluding the bubble euphoria that it went through, the price should steadily increase over time, assuming demand and general usage increases over time.  I would still think that if mining generally remains a hobbyist activity, power efficiency improves, and general demand for bitcoin increases, it would generally remain profitable.

What's the best practice for being able to create transactions on embedded devices without having to download the entire blockchain due to bandwidth and space restrictions? 
@_date: 2015-10-15 03:02:17
This explains the concept pretty well if anyone is wondering. 
@_date: 2015-10-09 01:53:42
Doesn't seem like such a bad idea.  They're probably trying to prove a concept where you can have a bunch of consumer electronics devices, ones that you would have anyway, that mine all day, while using a negligible amount and electricity.  Once you gain small amounts of bitcoin from mining in a pool, the bitcoin can go towards micro payments for various services online you would use like news articles, blogs, etc.  It seems like a much better alternative than being inundated with ads or having more and more media sources go out of business due to lack of paid subscriptions.

How does the receiving party confirm ownership of what that satoshi is supposed to represent?
@_date: 2015-10-24 23:45:32
The workflow for users constantly having to replenish their wallets from fiat via bank accounts and credit cards is way too user unfriendly and annoying for that to be commonplace. 
@_date: 2015-10-19 22:13:53
You'll lose money, so unless this is a learning exercise you shouldn't bother. 
@_date: 2015-10-19 21:07:11
Wouldn't the steady increase of per bitcoin prices and the decline of energy costs, due to more efficient chips, all work to keep mining profitable for most people?  Doesn't that have to be taken into consideration in addition to the increasing difficulty? 
@_date: 2015-10-19 18:38:24
Great news.   Hopefully at some point we'll be able to purchase super power efficient miners at low hashing rates, for home users, without having to break the bank on hardware and the electricity bill
@_date: 2015-10-15 03:12:14
Great example of a use case.  Others could be devices paying for media/blog posts, music downloads/playing, Video streaming like Netflix, etc.  All easily paid for in a user friendly way as  they wouldn't need to go setup some payment account or looking at ads as all payments occurs under the hood.

Great, I was unaware of these.  Thanks.
