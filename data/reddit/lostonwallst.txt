Literally every criticism from somebody who has bought into the hype of bitcoin responds with: “you have a well thought out and logical argument? You must know nothing about bitcoin. Head over to r/bitcoin to learn more.”
I don’t need to learn more, you guys are morons. Stop pretending it’s more than a get rich quick scheme. Bitcoin is worthless. Maybe a crypto one day will have a real purpose. Bitcoin’s is quick money.

First invested in bitcoin when it was $1. Thanks bro. ����‍♂️.
Crypto currency will never be more than an alternate form of currency in its current state. 
Every crypto on the market now is merely a speculation and has no real utility. 
It’s fun to make money fast. I get why you’re so defensive.
The real crypto that is adopted will be much more heavily regulated and sponsored or created by the banks and run on their exchanges. 
You can remind me 5 years if you’d like. I enjoy being right.
Also “I don’t understand it, I need to be more educated” ��
You just proved my point about the first post I made. I’m more aware than you are and have a differing opinion, so I’m lost and retarded. 
I was buying weed and molly with bitcoin when you were on your mom’s tit. You’re the late adopter.

People taking gains today will become people pulling out tomorrow out of fear and the crash will continue, just more slowly than today. I wouldn’t expect it above 13k by new year.
