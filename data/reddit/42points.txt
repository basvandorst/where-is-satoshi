As a mod you should really go to your preferences and edit the downvote comment threshold to like -1000.

There are a few changes I'd really like to see. 
1. Option to make the mod logs public. 
2. Option to have the reports on a post made public if the post is removed
3. Option for anyone to view the spam posts section of a subreddit by going to @_date: 2015-12-01 08:23:00
I placed "Undelete removed comments" in the sidebar a while back, it's under 'Using reddit'. It shows people all of the moderator removed comments if they really want to see what went down.

It works well every time I've checked. It's only a 2 second limit per account. 
Check a sub like askscience. It works great.

Dogecoin doesn't get a lot of orphans. It might be worth emulating them with the 1min block times.

OI, 
Please read 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:55:04
Maybe you should visit the doge subreddit more often :P
@_date: 2018-02-04 06:18:13
Dogecoin would agree!
@_date: 2015-04-08 01:20:57
Maybe do some reseach before spewing bs.

Dogecoin is already way past the mining phase. It's a fully fledged currency and it's value is stable. I have to say I'm really impressed. It's a real digital currency. Bitcoin will have to do something down the track. Not sure what they can do to fix the problem.

This person is trying to trick others into using their reference link. Just wanted to make people aware.

It probably depends on where you live. I had to get verified or it would have taken two days to transfer money. It takes two days to get verified. 
So if you want them right now try localbitcoins. It's like eBay for coins. People sit on there and sell. If you're with a good bank that has instant wire transfers to accounts or maybe accounts on the same branch you can buy straight away. Just buy from people who have good feed back if you're worried. 
Trade on BTC-E or MT GOX. Use places like  to store your bit coins away from exchanges.

$398 on BTC-E

Quarkcoin. It's a very different type of coin. Most of the coins have already been mined. The people who spent $1000s mining sold most of them off initially for next to nothing or even gave them away for free. This is called the distribution phase. This phase is still happening although now they on the market so you cant buy 1000s of them for a few bucks like a few months ago. I hear a lot of people say this is a risky coin but after reading into their plan and with over 20 years of experience in the share market I simply think qrk is a very well though out coin. I might even call it genius.  They're doing things this way to make it fair on everyone.  Unlike bitcoin these days where it near impossible to mine and make a profit unless you throw $15k into it.

I've had success with coinjar and localbitcoins.
