Could you elaborate on this one. Why were there 7 forks (and what were the consequences of these forks) and what do you mean by "you could collect that free money".
Thanks a lot

Really nice answer. 
Thanks for taking time to explain.
Some more explanations : 
- I am not day trading and I'm not planning on doing it. I'm not confident enough to do that and I don't think my nerves would support it. Also, I'm here to try something new not to make some profit day after day buy buying and selling like a trader.
- I understand that you want to put some limits to know when to sell and when to buy. But I read again and again your last comment and just understood something.
You don't HAVE TO put a value number for a limit order? Like "sell when price reaches 5k". You can put a % of fall / increase?
I mean you are right, if I buy at 10k, it goes to 30k and goes down to 5k, I would like to put a sell order at some point to not lose money (even if it's money I can afford to lose, it's stupid to lose it when you have a tool to prevent that). So the day it reaches 30k, I can put a sell order like if the price drops at 50% of its value, sell? (so at 15k).
Assuming it will keep going down. If it comes back at 30k 2month later, then I "lost" in investment value because I sold at 15k, bought back when it reached 17k for example and now I'm making profit again. But I still "wasted" 2k.
I know it's impossible to predict. But selling when it goes down can save you if bitcoin crashes. It's like planning something when the worst occurs. But I don't want to plan for a bad ending !! Even if I now know that it's the right thing to do.
Thank you.

I'm not clever enough to help you on this one. Hope you'll get an answer from someone who knows better.

I'm quite new to bitcoin and please forgive me if I say something stupid.
By "limit order", you mean that you can set things in advance like if the bitcoin price goes down, you automatically sell your bitcoins?
Like you bought some at 10k. Your plan is to hold but if bitcoin crashes and falls down to 5k, you can set a limit like "if it reaches 5k : sell all my bitcoin"?
If yes : Ok this can be great in emergency. But isn't it this kind of stuff that SOMETIMES make people lose some money. Like when there is a dip and you have set your selling limits too high, you automatically sell but it goes up 1 hour~~s~~ after and comes back to the normal value.
I mean, if I want to invest only money I can lose and my plan is to hold, I would NOT want to set this "selling when low" stuff.
On the other hand, if you set "buy when it's at x price" it can be great if such a dip (from my last example) happens. Cause it goes low and goes back up in the next day.
Tell me if I said stupid things and please correct me.
Last question : Does coinbase allow you to set up stuff liek that (selling/buying automatically) ? Or only other sites?
Thanks a lot !!! Have a nice day.
[EDIT] Proofread. So a lot of mistake corrections

I'm new to cryptocurrencies so I may be wrong.
But the goal of an hardwarewallet like Ledger Nano S is to NEVER put any passphrase / recovery 24words on your computer.
Writting them down on Excel even without saving the file could be a problem here.
I would just write them on a paper / metal anything, without touching an electronic / online device.
But maybe I'm wrong. Please feel free to correct me as I'm trying to learn as much as possible. And sorry if I spread misinformation.
