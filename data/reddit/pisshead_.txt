What legitimate enterprise could be easier than sending someone a little stick and getting a free 25k?

If it were that simple, why haven't they done it?

Buying bitcoin with dollars is buying something with dollars. Fiat currencies encourage people to spend them. So in your case, the declining dollar encourages you to spend dollars. But the growing value of bitcoin means you don't want to spend dollars.
So even for you, dollars were more useful for buying stuff than bitcoins.

That's what happens when your currency is totally unregulated and anarchic, it opens the doors to all sorts of scammers.
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:19:50
That doesn't sound like a good deal, the billionaire guy has nothing to lose.

If the dollar goes down then shares will go up.

Bitcoin will never be useful as a replacement for real currency if there are 'always' times you can't use it. Imagine not being able to eat because someone spammed the mempool.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:32:28
If it fails it will be because of its own design flaws, not a conspiracy.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:13:59
So what use is bitcoin if not as a currency?
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:49:52
New marketing slogan for BCH: crypto that doesn't support piracy!
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:45:27
Well that just answers the question. If bitcoin needs to become like normal money to be useful, why bother with it? Either fix bitcoin of everyone has to move to another cryptocurrency.

I was about to say this when I opened the thread. Except it will be buying lambos instead of building theme parks. What if the whole thing turns out to be a prank?
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:37:48
And your comment is a great example of decrying any negative comments about bitcoins as 'divisive' or 'polarising'. If you have to shut down or slander legitimate criticism (and you don't get to decide what that is), then what are you trying to hide?
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:51:03
So you're complaining that crypto is being treated like real currencies?
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:47:38
Then what's it for?
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:38:46
If you crash it then you'd lose the key.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:39:05
But then surely that's costing people a lot of bitcoins to do.
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:59:15
If bitcoin is supposed to be de-centralised, why does everyone use these de-centralised exchanges?
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:44:05
That's the whole point: governments don't want people sitting on money it's bad for the economy.
@_date: 2018-06-17 11:13:07
Who'd have thought that a free money scheme would attract people who are unscrupulously profit-hungry.
@_date: 2019-02-05 03:11:30
Inflation is on purpose, currencies aren't supposed to increase in purchasing power. 
@_date: 2019-02-05 03:11:48


Which makes it useless as a currency.

Reporting on a statement from the Bank of England isn't clickbait.

And in some jurisdictions they can sue you for giving bad investment advice.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:10:48


It's solving meaningless mathematical problems to enable the creation and trade of a currency which exists mainly to be stored because it's valuable, and is valuable only because it is valuable. 
It's like burning a pile of coal out in the open, just so you can stand on the ashes and be given a paper proving you've burnt some coal, which you can trade to other people who want that piece of paper because it's rare.

So who's buying Beanie Babies anymore?

Anyone you try to sell to next time will either have already bought in and lost 80% on it, or heard in the media about the last bubble that collapsed. With every bubble you run out of more marks until there are none left.

Housing markets recover, at the end you have a house that people need in order to live in. People don't need crypto.
@_date: 2018-03-21 04:27:11
Those problems are inherent to bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-26 00:15:54
Crypto never had any fundamentals.
@_date: 2018-07-09 08:53:38
Anyone who uses exchanges or lightning network.
@_date: 2018-07-26 16:49:04
@_date: 2018-07-26 16:49:35
Is bitcoin a currency or an investment? It can't really be both.
@_date: 2018-07-11 15:04:25
The point is you wanted to buy in when it was on the way up, not on the way down.
@_date: 2018-04-16 18:07:14
You're assuming they had some foresight and didn't just get lucky jumping on the right bubble.
@_date: 2018-12-13 17:57:08


And when you invest in bitcoins you're at the mercy of whoever's manipulating the bitcoin market.


People have been melting golf for thousands of years, what exactly is your point?
@_date: 2018-12-13 17:32:25
The Internet was invented for a reason, it solved a problem as soon as it existed. Of course your post is just another way of saying 'I can't think of an answer but maybe one will turn up'. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 17:37:03
4 isn't solving any problem, there are a million random things you can gamble your money on.

It's a service of centralised payment services. The point of bitcoin is that it's decentralised, meaning you can't have refunds without re-centralising it so there's something to refund. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 18:32:43
What difference does it make?
