Lots of negativity here but if you do your maths and want to do it then....
I have a similar setup, free electricity but i sleep about 5ft away from my miners and the mini fridge is louder than them. I have two S3+ but fitted new silent fans (120mm Nanoxia Deep Silence PWM Ultra-Quiet PC Fan)  I got four of those total, so she won't notice the noise.
In terms of heat it is like having a fan heater on, which is lush in the winter as being in a dorm I don't have massive control over when the heating comes on, in the summer it's a minor inconvenience.
I've run this for coming up to a year and it has returned my investment by buying the miners used from ebay for a very good price. But check and double check your maths since the reward halved. 
Also you mentioned you wouldn't be local to it so to keep maintenance down I would suggest putting aluminium dust filters on the inlets to the fans. Very cheep but means that if she's nice enough to run the hoover over the front of them when she cleans her room, you shouldn't ever need to take them apart for a clean.
And the s3's are very independent creatures, they don't need settings playing with once set up. If they loose internet connection and regain it then they start themselves back up. If they have a powercut, they start straight back up when power is restored. And you can monitor their hash rate on whichever pool you hook them up to.
Hope that helps.

I am frequently asked when I announce the completion of one of my node guides questions like, "Can I mine Bitcoin on the Node?" or "How much money does it make?" and things like that.
The nodes are of course essential to the network, but it's a rather humble task. The owner doesn't really benefit.... Until now!
How would you like your own personalized bitcoin address?
​This guide is a simple implementation of samr7's VanityGen program and uses spare CPU that the node doesn't need to create personalized addresses and private keys. Great for personal use to show off with, or businesses to accept bitcoin to an address with your company name! 
The direct link to the guide is:
And is a supplementary add-on to the guides on the rest of my site. Very easy to add.
So now put those spare CPU threads to work and generate your personalized address!

Hi again all,
Just completed updating my guides at  and I think I'm nearly done with my content creation stage for these guides. (I'm aware I've made a dew posts like this lately) I've added loads of new features the past couple of weeks which I hope you all like. The Nodes now include:
* Full Bitcoin node.
* 3.5" LCD Display, shows any webpage via chrome (kiosk mode).
* Tor support option
* Generate vanity Bitcoin addresses with spare CPU on the Pi.
Multiple webpages can be displayed in a scrolling mode, eg. Network stats, Bitcoin price, News, Weather, traffic updates for your commute (google maps) or anything to brighten up your desk, pictures etc
All feedback welcome, or any features you'd like added in future updates?

I would recommend a Raspberry Pi starter kit, approx £45
(that's the Pi 3b, power supply, 16Gb SD card and case)
The screen £8 from aliexpress, china, free shipping
A laptop (2.5") HDD from CEX: either 250GB £15, 320GB £18 or 500GB £20 would do it.
And the SATA -&gt; USB adapter for the HDD to the Pi £2 ebay
Less than £80 total at a guess.

Reading through these comments it seems everyone is quick to find flaws in it's use for conventional transactions. However this appears to be a great device for preserving anonymity whilst still transacting bitcoin person to person. 
Even by the companies guidlines they sugest backing up the private key when you recieve it from someone, which makes sence as you still remain annoymous. So the $10 fee for the device is the price of not apearing on the blockchain, whilst still holding bitcoin. To some people that's a fair price.
@_date: 2017-08-11 08:58:42
Sure, the blockchain size is approx 140Gb and is listed under the "Hardware" tab to aid in choosing a storage device. But yes I have forgotten to add info about data usage. Thanks for the suggestion.
As for a full data disclosure I can start monitoring, but in the meantime:
Gives a pretty accurate list of requirements regarding data.
* 140Gb initial download of blockchain
* A further 20Gb download per month
* Up to 200Gb upload per month
The upload is the most intensive. This is the node broadcasting transactions and maintaining the mempool. This can be capped in several ways:
-maxuploadtarget=&lt;MiB per day&gt; sets an upload cap
-maxconnections=&lt;num&gt; limits the number of connections to the node, also reducing data use. A default limitless figure usually draws approx 120 connections. I've limited mine to 25 to allow my network to run without any notable interference. 
Hope that helps for now. I'll start collecting my own data to verify.

Well without saying it directly i was implying it may be of use for someone that wanted funds and their origins to not be traceable to law enforcement (for example) or some level of future investigation. 
Yes i understand that a throw-away web wallet is another solution at the moment, through a vpn or tor could help, but that trail still exists.
This could help people that already have existing networks of buyers and sellers that are familiar with each other, to move funds between each other off the blockchain. 
This is all subjective of course, but i believe  that any transactions with throwaway addresses for example may give anonymity now, but we dont know what blockchain analysis will be available in the future and expose elements of the chain. This device just breaks a section of that ownership chain.
@_date: 2019-12-23 18:56:46
Thanks, didn't realise until that first comment here.
@_date: 2019-12-23 18:44:09
So in the use case of OP he/she would run the bitcoin node on the raspberry pi. 
Then on a pc connected to the same LAN, connect the bitcoin wallet to this node. Any transactions OP makes are then verified by his node, after some checks his node broadcasts his transaction other nodes and so it propagates across the network.
That's why people run their own nodes. It is then up to the user what additional privacy steps they want to make.
If you're interested a common privacy setting is for a tor "bridging" node, where transactions received via local RPC connection from the wallet are only sent out over tor connections. The clearnet connection is for sycronising the block height only.
By sending your transactions over tor only it propagates the tor nodes. When it is received back from the tor transaction pool it is then broadcast over clearnet, masking it's original source.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:43:06
Yeah I'm curious too.
I make guides on making nodes for home users and events like this really are a curveball.
I'd only [recently finished the SegWit2x guide](
I'd be keen to know what was on the horizon so I can prepare.
@_date: 2019-12-23 23:42:56
It's really not.
The point of software like raspiblitz and the other one mentioned in this thread is that people are trying the take the barrier of "too techy" away.
Any user can copy the disk image of raspiblitz for example to an SD card and have a node up and running in less than an hour. It will then take some time depending on your hardware to synchronise.
Software like that, and others, have all the settings pre-programed. All you need to decide is which ones need to be enabled to fit your needs, (privacy, lightning, mining pool etc) and deciding what you want can be tricky to realise. 
You'll most likely set one up and then decide how you could set one up better next time. Which again would only take a few minutes to reset.
Give it a go.
@_date: 2019-12-23 17:41:15
I used to make guides for bitcoin raspberry pi nodes, but have stopped since raspiblitz came on the scene.
It walks you through step by step and even the option to setup a lightning node.

Unfortunately not but yeah TOR, good plan. I'll look into it.

In most cases people have Ledger/Trezor and sensible backups in place. If they're all kept in one location though and you want protection from the elements then this could be a bit of a DIY curiosity to fill an afternoon.
@_date: 2017-04-08 21:06:18
I think someone else may have to tag in with a definite answer to be sure. Someone with a solid understanding of the code. 
My understanding is that if you ran the node and the wallet together it could be completely trusted to prevent double spends, as it follow the bitcoin rules completely. However I'd love for someone to elaborate.
Some other opinion here

I've listed all the parts at the start of this post.
But the main costly components
US amazon raspbery Pi3B $37

Add a bit of Acrylic and plastic risers from somewhere and I'd guess less than $100

If I'm honest, most of my decision to use the Pidrive was how it looked, I wanted as few cables as possible, no adapters converting sata-&gt;usb etc. Being the size it is it forms the back-plate of this unit nicely.
You can probably get a cheeper 375GB drive or larger, but it doesn't exactly break the bank and keeps this a sub £100 project.

I included a detailed image of the screen reverse on my imgur. Compare with images that other suppliers have to find a match elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-04-08 15:19:54
A node is best running 24/7 so the benefit comes with the tiny power consumption of around 3.6Watts for a raspberry pi3, depending on what you have plugged into it. 
In my case the Pidrive pulls another  2.75 watts and the screen I have no idea, but it all runs happliy on a 5v 3A power supply so total can't be any more than 15W
They run bitcoin core so wallets on them are also an option.
@_date: 2017-04-09 21:00:01
Cost is the biggest factor, after all it's just a project. 
It's a constant coin flip between mechanical wear of a HDD and write endurance of a SSD when running 24/7
Would I be right in thinking perhaps SSD has the edge as I assume it writes a block to the chain once and doesn't do much else with it in terms of overwriting again? I'm only guessing though.
@_date: 2017-04-08 20:47:14
Just because it's packaged into the raspberry pi doesn't mean it has any limitations. It's running a full version of bitcoin core v13.2 which by default includes a transaction verification engine. It would take a little more info to know what exactly you want to do differently with it, but if it's a feature for core 13.2 then it has it.
@_date: 2017-04-09 08:37:10
The blockchain is approx 120GB, and add 8GB for all of bitcoin core's dependencies.

Haha I didn't notice, again I was following the raspnode guide for that stage and entered 
  git clone -b 0.13 
I'd assume that just takes a simple correction to 
  git clone -b 0.14

**Part two, split due to character limit **
(6) 
**Add light gui** credit to 
*Note I've included the extra install of xserver-xorg-video-fbdev as is required to display on the generic 3.5tft. It is what is used in step (7) to display onto fb1 using 99-fbdev.conf
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade
	sudo apt-get clean
	sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends xserver-xorg
	sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends xinit xserver-xorg-video-fbdev
	sudo apt-get install lxde-core lxappearance
	sudo apt-get install lightdm
	sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends matchbox chromium-browser
**create file** this is to force display to 3.5"tft credit to 
	sudo nano /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-fbdev.conf
**should be blank, add the following text**
	Section "Device"
	  Identifier "touchscreen"
	  Driver "fbdev"
	  Option "fbdev" "/dev/fb1"
	EndSection
**save, exit, ctrl+o ctrl+x***
	sudo reboot
pi will reboot and after about 1 min for initial setup will load GUI onto 3.5 display giving a desktop
(8) **onscreen settings, screensaver disable, sleep mode disable, auto-boot chrome**
On raspberry pi 3.5tft with mouse/keyboard, (on-screen keyboard was installed, called 'matchbox' found under accessories tab if required)
	click bottom left then, preferences, screensaver, dropdown box, disable (also check advanced tab that power saving settings are disabled)
	click bottom left then, preferences, default applications for LXSession,autostart, in 'add' box type:
	 --kiosk 
**any web address can be used in the above box.**  I suggest looking at  for their list of bitcoin specific pages. From worldwide node distribution to price widgets, transaction data...
reboot the pi to autostart chrome at the chosen page. Either shutdown through the GUI or SSH, sudo reboot
**moving the filesystem to a USB drive to allow space for the blockchain**
Now that the GUI has been taken care of we can move everything to the USB drive to boot the pi from there.
The easiest way for me was to use adafruits guide and helper utility. They've made a helper that does nearly all the work for you, detailed here  
There are plenty of other guides for moving the file system to a USB drive but for me as a beginner it all got a little wordy.
*I've just tried to write a list of commands for you, but the adafruit page does it better and has more easy to follow info
Once you've follow their short guide and the pi is booting from the USB drive we can add bitcoin-d.
**installing bitcoin core** credit to 
This again was achieved by me following a guide, however as we have used other guides previously a few steps are obsolete. If you follow the link above and want to use their instructions then you need to read ahead a little to miss out a few steps already covered like mounting drives etc. We only need to install the cli side of bitcoin core. You don't want the GUI as we are already displaying the webpage. This node will run in the background.
We start with
	mkdir ~/bitcoinData
then enlarge the swapfile so the blockchain loads quicker
	sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile
And change the default size of 100
To 1000
	CONF_SWAPSIZE=1000
save, exit, ctrl+o ctrl+x
Then, to build the new swap file...
	sudo dphys-swapfile setup
	sudo dphys-swapfile swapon
This one liner will download and install the packages we will need for Bitcoin Core 0.13.0:
	sudo apt-get install autoconf libevent-dev libtool libssl-dev libboost-all-dev libminiupnpc-dev -y
As we installed Raspbian Jessie Lite you'll need to install git:
	sudo apt-get install git -y
make a directory to download the files
	mkdir ~/bin
	cd ~/bin
then download bitcoin core 0.14.x
	git clone -b 0.14 
then navigate to our bitcoinData folder to install it all
	cd bitcoinData/
	./autogen.sh
	./configure --enable-upnp-default --disable-wallet
	make                  
**the guide says to use 'make -j2' as the command but I encountered an error. It recommends using just 'make' if errors occur and this worked fine but installed slower. Took around 10mins.
	sudo make install
then we configure and run it
	nano bitcoin.conf
and add to it
	rpcuser=bitcoinrpc
	rpcpassword=21Hy2d5kycuoLzWxdJjQoVN1jtL7Q5kzqhHz3ZfuYNCU
**change the password to something else**
save, exit, ctrl+o ctrl+x
Then we run it!
	bitcoind -datadir=/home/pi/bitcoinData -daemon
It will then connect and download/verify blocks, sadly this will take around 3weeks in total, such is the size of the blockchain
To verify it's working use
	bitcoin-cli -datadir=/home/pi/bitcoinData getinfo
check you have 8 connections (after giving it 5 mins to start and get them) and each time you use that command the value of "blocks": xxxxx should be increasing. That is your current block height. It will get slower later on as blocks start being 1MB each.
To keep this running in the background I keep a screen open
(11)**installing 'screen'** credit to 
this so you can close the ssh session and turn off your pc without killing the processes on the raspberry pi. 
	sudo apt-get install screen
Then, to use it, type…
	screen bash
It will open another terminal instance. You can now start a process you want to be able to leave running and reconnect to later.
then use ctrl+a, release then D to detatch it
screens can be rejoined using command
	screen -r
Refer to the page I have credited for more information.
(12) **Future tweaking**
The default webpage can changed by ssh, editing the lxsession/LXDE autostart that we clicked on earlier.
	sudo nano ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE/autostart
It will look like
	
	 --profile LXDE
	 --desktop --profile LXDE
	 -no-splash
	 --kiosk --incognito  
To auto-boot bitcoind and run the node on power-on add on a new line at the bottom
	 -datadir=/home/pi/bitcoinData -daemon
Unless the blockchain gets corrupted it will carry on where it left off.
(13) **security**
I've been made aware that there are some underlying defaults that can affect system security one is to disable root login by ssh by editing
	 sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
and changing
	PermitRootLogin without-password
	PermitRootLogin no
and add the line below to only allow ssh access to user 'pi'
	AllowUsers pi
Save, ctrl+o, enter, exit ctrl+x
then reboot sshd by
	 sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart
I will update as I'm informed of other issues.
That's all.
@_date: 2017-04-08 18:08:41
Yeah was one of the perks of it, keeps everything neat.
If I'm honest I saw it and didn't look at an alternative (like a 2.5" drive and adapters) Seemed perfect but I wonder if there are other discrete options out there? 
Still had to make my own case, if you can call what I made a case. It's just 2 bits of acrylic. But I definatley didn't like the case WD sells
@_date: 2019-12-24 23:58:12
Yes there is some hardware involved. In the picture OP has it looks like a Raspberry Pi, probably the new 4 version.
The older 3B+ works fine, cheaper, OPs obviously would give better performance.
As I was getting to in my last comment, it all depends on what you need from your Bitcoin. And I know sounds really cliché. But as it is decentralised, your bitcoin is yours and everyone preaches that you're your own bank, this hardware cost for a node is your investment in using it privately*.
I feel like a dick for just saying that. But yes it's great to support bitcoin running your own node, the big picture stuff, however ultimately users run their own nodes for their own reasons.
It's our own economy, with its own risk/reward. If you see the costs (approx a touch less than $100) to run the tech for privacy and your own node are too high then people won't, and will use public remote nodes. Which in most cases is fine. At the end of the day it's down to the user. And their choice. Which is the point of bitcoin. But it'd be great if through discussions like this people were informed of what options were out there and why they exist.
Tldr: sounds like you could get the hardware and build your own private node. You should ask yourself if you really need to.
If you don't NEED to, are you interested enough to do it anyway to learn it's significance.

I am beginner to raspberry Pi's and so had a huge amount of help from various guides, all credited below.
The title image shows the node displaying Johan Nordberg's realtimebitcoin.info however any page can be displayed.
The Pi auto-boots bitcoind for the full node and chromium-browser displaying a page in kiosk mode on the generic display (not adafruit).  This HOWTO should work on generic 3.2,3.5,4,4.3,5,7 and 10.1 inch displays.
Constructed using
raspberry pi 3 - model B - £32
375GB western Digital PIDrive - Foundation edition (includes 4GB SD, used for this project) - £40
aliexpress - generic 3.5tft screen £8.36 (also available from ebay for a little more) 
seller displaypro_uk
3mm Acrylic sheet A5 £1.90 free p+p
M3 black Nylon Hex spacers various sellers less than £4 for 100pc. Sizes I used from pack
4x 8mm,
4x 5mm,
4x 30mm (assembled 4x 20mm and 4x 10mm to get cumulative 30mm),
4x M3 nylon nuts,
4x M3 nylon washers,
8x M3 nylon screws,
All in cost less than £90.
Below is a howto of how I made it.
All commands to type in shadowed boxes.
Also my Pc is windows 7, but I'm sure those with different OS can follow this with a google of alternate formatting and image software.
Steps (1)-(4) Are general setup of raspbian, wifi, ssh and updates.
Step (5) is installing the generic display however if you've purchased another display then the manufacturers software should be installed here.
Steps (6)-(8) Installs the desktop and auto-booting to chrome in kiosk mode. at this point it is essentially an auto-booting PoS display
Steps (9) and (10) Allow for and install the bitcoin full node.
Steps (11)-(13) Are extras that give smoother running, auto-boot the node on power-on, increased security and a HOWTO of changing the displayed webpage.
Here is an image file on my google drive that skips out steps (1)-(8)


If using that then start at step (9*). The image file does not depend on using a Pidrive (I think), in theory any USB drive will work. At step 9 when we migrate files it will be drive specific. Step 9 onward in the easy bit anyway.
*This image file doesn't have your wifi settings in it and will need either an Ethernet connection to ssh into it to change those (step 2), or when it boots to the screen and terminal use a keyboard attached to the pi and change those on the screen.
**step (1)**
connecting peripherals 
I used: USB drive (pidrive and it's included power cable), USB mouse and Ethernet
Get a Jessie-lite 2Gb image from 
On a PC rename SD card to "BOOT" if necessary
SD card formatted using SDformatter
Raspbian lite image installed to SD card using Win32DiskImager. 
Add "ssh" file to Boot main directory to enable ssh.(Jessie-lite as default has ssh disabled. To enable it use notepad, save a blank document called "ssh" (with quotes) as file type 'all files' to the highest level of the sd card.
ssh into raspberry pi user"pi" password "Raspberry" 192.168.1.x (raspberry pi IP can be found using IPscanner software or connecting it via HDMI, it will display it's IP on the HDMI output once loading is complete)
**Enabling Wifi**
	sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
Go to the bottom of the file and add the following text:
	
	network={
    	ssid="YOUR WIFI ROUTER NAME"
    	psk="YOUR WIFI ROUTER PASSWORD"
	}
save and exit using
	ctrl+O
	then 'enter'
	ctrl+X
	sudo reboot 
remove Ethernet cable
(3) **expand the file system**
	sudo raspi-config
select "expand filesystem"
select 'finish' system will reboot
check file system expanded by using command below (the -h flag means human readable, showing size in 'G' gigabytes, 'M' megabytes, etc)
	df -h
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade
**Install the screen**
credit for this section to  see their page if more info needed.
	sudo wget 
	sudo tar xvf LCD-show-170309.tar.gz
	cd LCD-show/
	sudo ./LCD35-show
...takes some time ("LCD configure 0" displayed for a while)
**rotate screen credit to 
system will reboot, so re-ssh to pi and direct yourself back to LCD-show folder
	cd LCD-show/
	sudo ./LCD35-show 180

Either find someone that has a completed project and clone it onto yours. Or from a windows PC you can use a program called Putty that does something called SSH. You basicaly access it through it's IP address and edit files that way.

Thanks, the acrylic is to keep it cube-like and stable so it sits level.
The display is also a touch screen but obviously looses that capability with the acrylic over it. Not an issue in this case as there is no need for touch, but a simple re-design would allow it

You don't get paid to run a node.
The benefit if used correctly is added privacy. Your ISP will know you are running a bitcoin node, (unless you take precautions by using a VPN) however configuring the node to bridge through Tor correctly will hide the source of your transactions, hiding yours that you send to the pool.
It then starts getting complicated at this point as to which is the weakest point for an attack vector against your privacy (malicious tor exit node for example) but the overall point is that running your own bitcoin node offers options to try and take control of your privacy.
@_date: 2017-04-08 15:45:54
Good idea, I'll head over. 
Maybe one or two of them will set up a node! 
Although I imagine they'll be more interested in how I got the generic display to work and auto-boot chrome to kiosk mode :)

| "It's common for full nodes on high-speed connections to use 200 gigabytes upload or more a month. Download usage is around 20 gigabytes a month, plus around an additional 100 gigabytes the first time you start your node."

Great! If you're in the UK the company I used for that Acrylic is at the top of my comment post. As for the screws and risers, the black nylon ones come in cheap sets on ebay. Again sizes listed in the post.
Now that I know the exact sizes I need I've ordered brass one's to replace the nylon. Purely for looks.
And yes it's a touch screen, I just couldn't think of a reason to use it in this project. Maybe you can? Didn't want to complicate this just for the sake of complicating it.
Once again and I've said a few times I'm still somewhat a beginner at this, any problems just PM me or post here and I'll try my best to support you or anyone else having issues setting this up.

Those scews/risers etc are exactly them. I had them laying around from a previous project so was lucky. I bought them from aliexpress, I think that one's going to come down to shipping cost/time.

If you want to stay CLI
Also uses tor-arm to monitor bandwidth.
It's an old guide of mine and if you're already running a node it should be simple to go straight to the tor config step. I've used this method with Monero very recently and it works but if you have any problems message me and I'll help out.
Should take 20 mins max to configure as it's mostly good to go on default settings.

I tried that, the only thing I could stamp clearly was aluminium but it has a low melting point so wouldn't survive a house fire.
I couldn't get my stamps to leave a good "image" on Stainless Steel busines cards I bought for this purpose. I took another route though:

The way most people would do this is with a laser toner printer, really common.
I already have an inkjet printer and didn't see the purpose of having another type of printer, so for the same price went for the laser engraver. They're so cheap and I've been customizing my phone case and all sorts. Fun kit.
I'm intrigued how coinsquare do that in their kit. I'm guessing heat transfer and laser toner printer/photocopier

For anyone interested in running a Full Node on a Raspberry Pi as a fun project I've been making a library of guides here 
@_date: 2018-07-14 15:04:26
Hi, yes Raspberry Pi 3B is fine and you're going about it the right way with an external HDD.
I run the site [PiNode.co.uk]( which has all the information you need. Step by step, screenshots, commands and a little section with a couple of bits of free software that are useful to get the Pi started for absolute beginners if needed.
and as mentioned I also have the reddit sub which you can use to ask questions if you get stuck along the way.
@_date: 2017-09-03 22:44:54
Haha yeah I'll never use that one. It was a rainy day today so was just seeing if making this was possible.
@_date: 2018-07-14 16:54:45
Thanks. TBH the Bitcoin nodes havn't drawn much interest recently as they don't offer any rewards.
For node building the way forward seems to be with proof of stake coins/nodes. Done right they can award a decent profit. I'm expanding in that section.
@_date: 2017-05-19 12:31:53
Thanks for your input. It's amazing how quickly these things progress. I'll have to get around to updating this how-to again, and arrange it in such a format to incorporate your solution to a problem.
I've also had suggestions to run this on the TOR network which I intend to add as an extra if desired. Love how fluid this all is.

I know what you mean by remote server and technically yes. I goes to a website made by Johan Nordberg that pulls the price from a weighted average from major exchanges.
The raspberry pi is best thought of as doing two things. A device that boots full screen to a web page, and a full node, separately.  
I recommend in the guide of checking out  for a list of other bitcoin relevant webpages to display (it will display anything you tell it, BBC news if you wanted! Or the weather, substitute the Acrylic for one-way mirror and make a magic mirror out of it? what-ever). I liked Johan's one due to it's dark background and displaying the price in one of 16 currencies.
You could also display the current BIP148 node adoption rates from  and auto refresh every 10 mins for example.
@_date: 2017-05-20 00:20:27
It was all too separated before. Hopefully with it consolidated and in steps different sections could be used in all sorts of projects by picking and choosing what's needed.
Should help someone out.
@_date: 2017-05-20 08:08:07
It's beautiful!!
I like the use of the graph too. Shame they don't do a BTC-&gt;GBP graph otherwise I'd switch to that too.
Is there anything worth mentioning about the screen trouble? I'm trying to make this guide more complete and concise than the last and am adding screen troubleshooting to an Annex at the bottom of the guide.
Great job
@_date: 2017-05-19 18:23:03
Can someone elaborate? 
Do nodes have no effect on whether a BIP is implimented? It's just down to it's version number as to whether it would be compatable with a BIP?
Then would a miner create BIP107 blocks until one got acepted by the network?
@_date: 2017-05-19 23:38:23
**Part two, split due to character limit **
(6) 
**Add light gui** credit to 
*Note I've included the extra install of xserver-xorg-video-fbdev as is required to display on the generic 3.5tft. It is what is used in step (7) to display onto fb1 using 99-fbdev.conf
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade
	sudo apt-get clean
	sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends xserver-xorg
	sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends xinit xserver-xorg-video-fbdev
	sudo apt-get install lxde-core lxappearance
	sudo apt-get install lightdm
	sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends matchbox chromium-browser
**create file** this is to force display to 3.5"tft credit to 
	sudo nano /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-fbdev.conf
**should be blank, add the following text**
	Section "Device"
	  Identifier "touchscreen"
	  Driver "fbdev"
	  Option "fbdev" "/dev/fb1"
	EndSection
**save, exit, ctrl+o ctrl+x***
	sudo reboot
pi will reboot and after about 1 min for initial setup will load GUI onto 3.5 display giving a desktop
(8) **onscreen settings, screensaver disable, sleep mode disable, auto-boot chrome**
On raspberry pi 3.5tft with mouse/keyboard, (on-screen keyboard was installed, called 'matchbox' found under accessories tab if required)
	click bottom left then, preferences, screensaver, dropdown box, disable (also check advanced tab that power saving settings are disabled)
	click bottom left then, preferences, default applications for LXSession,autostart, in 'add' box type:
	 --kiosk --incognito 
**any web address can be used in the above box.**  I suggest looking at  for their list of bitcoin specific pages. From worldwide node distribution to price widgets, transaction data...
Some of these settings can be changed via ssh. Take a peek at step (11) for more info if needed. I found the above GUI method easier though.
reboot the pi to autostart chrome at the chosen page. Either shutdown through the GUI or SSH, sudo reboot
**moving the filesystem to a USB drive to allow space for the blockchain**
Now that the GUI has been taken care of we can move everything to the USB drive to boot the pi from there.
The easiest way for me was to use adafruits guide and helper utility. They've made a helper that does nearly all the work for you, detailed here  
There are plenty of other guides for moving the file system to a USB drive but for me as a beginner it all got a little wordy.
*I've just tried to write a list of commands for you, but the adafruit page does it better and has more easy to follow info
Once you've follow their short guide and the pi is booting from the USB drive we can add bitcoin-d.
**installing bitcoin core** credit to  **Due to block scaling debate please refer to Annex B at the end of this guide for instructions on installing "Bitcoin Core v0.14.1 UASF-Segwit:0.3(BIP148)" if you wish. Otherwise continue with this step (10) to install the default Bitcoin Core v14.x**
This again was achieved by me following a guide, however as we have used other guides previously a few steps are obsolete. If you follow the link above and want to use their instructions then you need to read ahead a little to miss out a few steps already covered like mounting drives etc. We only need to install the cli side of bitcoin core. You don't want the GUI as we are already displaying the webpage. This node will run in the background.
We start with
	mkdir ~/bitcoinData
then enlarge the swapfile so the blockchain loads quicker
	sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile
And change the default size of 100
To 1000
	CONF_SWAPSIZE=1000
save, exit, ctrl+o ctrl+x
Then, to build the new swap file...
	sudo dphys-swapfile setup
	sudo dphys-swapfile swapon
This one liner will download and install the packages we will need for Bitcoin Core 0.14.x:
	sudo apt-get install autoconf libevent-dev libtool libssl-dev libboost-all-dev libminiupnpc-dev -y
As we installed Raspbian Jessie Lite you'll need to install git:
	sudo apt-get install git -y
make a directory to download the files
	mkdir ~/bin
	cd ~/bin
then download bitcoin core 0.14.x
	git clone -b 0.14 
then navigate to our bitcoin folder to install it all
	cd bin/bitcoin
	./autogen.sh
	./configure --enable-upnp-default --disable-wallet
	make  **see note below **                
**Note** the guide says to use 'make -j2' as the command but I encountered an error. It recommends using just 'make' if errors occur and this worked fine but installed slower. Took around 10mins.
	sudo make install
then we configure the node.
	nano bitcoin.conf
and add to it
	rpcuser=bitcoinrpc
	rpcpassword=yourpasswordhere
save, exit, ctrl+o ctrl+x
Then we run it!
	bitcoind -datadir=/home/pi/bitcoinData -daemon
It will then connect and download/verify blocks, sadly this will take around 4weeks in total, such is the size of the blockchain
To verify it's working use
	bitcoin-cli -datadir=/home/pi/bitcoinData getinfo
check you have 8 connections (after giving it 5 mins to start and get them) and each time you use that command, the value of "blocks": xxxxx should be increasing. That is your current block height. It will get slower later on as blocks start being 1MB each.
To keep this running in the background I keep a screen open.
Although this takes around 4 weeks to sync, the webpage you've told it to display will be running fine. So at least it will look nice :)
(11)**installing 'screen'** credit to 
this so you can close the ssh session and turn off your pc without killing the processes on the raspberry pi. 
	sudo apt-get install screen
Then, to use it, type…
	screen bash
It will open another terminal instance. You can now start a process you want to be able to leave running and reconnect to later.
then use ctrl+a, release then D to detatch it
screens can be rejoined using command
	screen -r
Refer to the page I have credited for more information.
(12) **Future tweaking**
The default webpage can changed by ssh, editing the lxsession/LXDE autostart that we clicked on earlier.
	sudo nano ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE/autostart
It will look like
	
	 --profile LXDE
	 --desktop --profile LXDE
	 -no-splash
	 --kiosk --incognito  
To auto-boot bitcoind and run the node on power-on add on a new line at the bottom
	 -datadir=/home/pi/bitcoinData -daemon
Unless the blockchain gets corrupted it will carry on where it left off.
It has been sugested by to use the line
		 -n 1 chromium-browser --kiosk --incognito  
instead of the  line as he believes it uses less resources. I am trialing 's sugestion and will add comment later. I can confirm the display appears exactly the same visibly, I havn't compared resources.
(13) **security**
I've been made aware that there are some underlying defaults that can affect system security one is to disable root login by ssh by editing
	 sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
and changing
	PermitRootLogin without-password
	PermitRootLogin no
and add the line below to only allow ssh access to user 'pi'
	AllowUsers pi
Save, ctrl+o, enter, exit ctrl+x
then reboot sshd by
		sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart
I will update as I'm informed of other issues.

I cut the Acrylic with a small hacksaw blade. Then sanded the edged with 240-ish paper. 
To get it polished I used a dremmel and most polishing compounds would work (I used a car body restorer because that's what I had lying around). But it wouldn't take too long to polish the edges by hand as it's quite small.

I'm joining you right now brother (updating my node to core 14 then signaling as I type). 
I've been running a full node and listening to the arguing and bickering over the two main solutions to this scaleing issue. I've waited this long because deep down I don't like either of them! But now segwit/148 seems to be a more proven concept via litecoins success with it, I'm gunna try and help the network by voting this way. 
In an ideal world I'd like dynamic block sizes like Monero. Not sure if that's ever possible �� but for now I'll help us put a band-aid on this issue until blocks get full again.
@_date: 2017-05-19 23:38:44
Annex's are additional information based on other users experiences of creating this project, consolidated and credited. The exception is Annex B which was added due to the blocksize debate and shows how to support BIP148/SegWit. 
**Annex A**
Credit to for this fix. (I've not used this method so I recommend directing questions concerning it his way)
Had trouble with white screen using the waveshare overlays provided by spotpear with my clone 3.5" LCD. Ending up modifying the install a bit. Sharing what I did to get the screen to work.
ssh in the pi and install the fbdev display driver;
		sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-fbdev
Modify the config file;
		sudo nano /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-fbdev.conf
To which add the following;
	Section "Device"
		Identifier "touchscreen"
		Driver "fbdev"
		Option "fbdev" "/dev/fb1"
	EndSection
save changes
Edit boot config;
		sudo nano /boot/config.txt
Commeted out the the dtoverlay=* entries added by LCD-show script with a 
		
		
Add this line;
		dtoverlay=piscreen,speed=24000000,rotate=270, fps=30
save changes
Pass argument to the kernel;
		sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt
Add following arguments after "rootwait", on the same line;
		fbcon=map:10 fbcon=font:ProFont6x11 logo.nologo
save changes
Reboot the pi. Screen should work now. If you only have the command line, ssh back into the pi to change the boot option;
		sudo raspi-config
Select "Desktop Autologin Desktop GUI, automatically logged in as 'pi' user"
If still white screen, try
		ls -l /dev/input/event*
There should be and event for each input device attached (keyboard, mouse, LCD). Can also identify the input devices with;
		cat /proc/bus/input/devices
If your "Touchscreen" is not listed, might be a hardware problem with the screen.
**Annex B** 
If you have followed the default instructions and completed all steps (1) to (10) above, installing the standard Bitcoin Core v14.x and wish to **only signal UASF/SegWit/BIP148 (without migrating at this stage)** then use Part 1 below.
If you wish to **migrate to BIP148/UASF/SegWit NOW and commit your node to it (not just signal with a flag)**. Then substitute the entirity of part (10) above with this Annex B (part 2), once (part 2) has been completed you may continue to step (11) above and complete the guide. 
**(Part 1)**
In step (10) we install the default Bitcoin Core and edit the bitcoin.conf file. Additonal flags can be added here to signal UASF, SEGWIT and BIP148 if desired. Do your research before adding this. I am not endorsing it, this is just showing how. Credit to for mentioning this in the comments.
		nano bitcoin.conf
If step (10) is completed it will look like
		rpcuser=bitcoinrpc
		rpcpassword=yourpasswordhere
add the line below to show support for BIP148.
		rpcuser=bitcoinrpc
		rpcpassword=yourpasswordhere
		uacomment=UASF-SegWit-BIP148
save, exit, reboot node.
If on for before 1st August 2017 BIP148 is activated successfuly (Part 2) should be incorporated.

Full Node, Bitcoin Core v0.14.1 UASF-Segwit:0.3(BIP148), Raspberry Pi3B, 3.5"Generic TFT with network stats + HOW-TO Guide
Although this was initialy posted a little over a month ago, this is a Mk2 and huge improvements have been made including incorporation of Bitcoin Core v0.14.1 UASF-Segwit:0.3(BIP148) (if the user desires), security issues addressed, and faults corrected.
I am new to raspberry Pi's and so had a huge amount of help from various guides/reddit users, all credited below.
The title image shows the node displaying Johan Nordberg's realtimebitcoin.info however any page can be displayed.
The Pi auto-boots to chromium-browser and displays a page in kiosk mode on the generic display (not adafruit).  This HOWTO should work on generic 3.2,3.5,4,4.3,5,7 and 10.1 inch displays.
**This project as default will run bitcoincore v14.1 full-node. However with the current bitcoin scaling discussion I have included in Annex B (Part 1) instructions on how to enable UASF/SegWit/BIP148 signaling. And In Annex B (Part 2) how to skip the default install of bitcoincore 14.1 and instead install Bitcoin Core v0.14.1 UASF-Segwit:0.3(BIP148) if you wish.**
Constructed using
raspberry pi 3 - model B - £32
375GB western Digital PIDrive - Foundation edition (includes 4GB SD, used for this project) - £40
aliexpress - generic 3.5tft screen £8.36 (also available from ebay for a little more) 
seller displaypro_uk supplied the 3mm Acrylic sheet "A5 size" £1.90 free p+p
M3 black Nylon Hex spacers various ebay sellers less than £4 for 100pc. Sizes I used from pack
4x 8mm,
4x 5mm,
4x 30mm (assembled 4x 20mm and 4x 10mm to get cumulative 30mm),
4x M3 nylon nuts,
4x M3 nylon washers,
8x M3 nylon screws,
All in cost less than £90.
All commands to type in shadowed boxes.
Also my Pc is windows 7, but I'm sure those with different OS can follow this googling alternate formatting and disk-image software.
**Steps (1)-(4)** Are general setup of pi, raspbian, wifi, ssh and updates.
**Step (5)** is installation of the generic display however if you've purchased another display then the manufacturers software should be installed here.
**Steps (6)-(8)** Installs the desktop and auto-booting to chrome in kiosk mode. At this point it is essentially an auto-booting PoS display
**Steps (9) and (10)** Allow for and install the bitcoin full node. See Annex B for Bitcoin Core v0.14.1 UASF-Segwit:0.3(BIP148)
**Steps (11)-(13)** Are extras that give smoother running, auto-boot the node at power-on(12), increased security (13) and a HOWTO of changing the displayed webpage.
**Annex A** - support for display issues regarding whitescreen from on driver install step
**Annex B - support and information on how to configure your node to signal/run BIPs/segwit/UASF etc**
**Annex C** - How to run your node through the TOR. Credit to **Annex D** - Reports of running sudo apt-get update/upgrade on completed projects kicks display driver. Fix courtesy of __________________________________________________________________________________
Here is an image file on my google drive that skips out steps (1)-(8) this should work subject to having a similar hardware setup to me.


If using that then start at step (9*). The image file does not depend on using a Pidrive (I think), in theory any USB drive will work. At step 9 when we migrate files it will be drive specific. Step 9 onward in the easy bit anyway.
**This image file does not contain your wifi settings for obvious reasons, and will need either an Ethernet connection to ssh into it to change those ( step 2), or when it boots use the screen and terminal with keyboard attached to the pi and change those settings on screen.
**step (1)**
connecting peripherals 
I used: USB drive (pidrive and it's included power cable), USB mouse and Ethernet
Get a Jessie-lite 2Gb image from 
On a PC rename SD card to "BOOT" if necessary
SD card formatted using SDformatter
Raspbian lite image installed to SD card using Win32DiskImager. 
Add a "ssh" file to Boot main directory to enable ssh.(Jessie-lite as default has ssh disabled. To enable it use notepad, save a blank document called "ssh" (with quotes) as file type 'all files' to the highest level of the sd card. The pi will find this file on boot and enable ssh.
ssh into raspberry pi user"pi" password "Raspberry" 192.168.1.x (raspberry pi IP can be found using IPscanner software or connecting it via HDMI, it will display it's IP on the HDMI output once loading is complete)
**Enabling Wifi**
	sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
Go to the bottom of the file and add the following text:
	
	network={
    	ssid="YOUR WIFI ROUTER NAME"
    	psk="YOUR WIFI ROUTER PASSWORD"
	}
save and exit using
	ctrl+O
	then 'enter'
	ctrl+X
	sudo reboot 
remove Ethernet cable
(3) **expand the file system**
	sudo raspi-config

**Annex A**
Credit to for this fix. (I've not used this method so I recommend directing questions concerning it his way)
Had trouble with white screen using the waveshare overlays provided by spotpear with my clone 3.5" LCD. Ending up modifying the install a bit. Sharing what I did to get the screen to work.
ssh in the pi and install the fbdev display driver;
		sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-fbdev
Modify the config file;
		sudo nano /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-fbdev.conf
To which add the following;
	Section "Device"
		Identifier "touchscreen"
		Driver "fbdev"
		Option "fbdev" "/dev/fb1"
	EndSection
save changes
Edit boot config;
		sudo nano /boot/config.txt
Commeted out the the dtoverlay=* entries added by LCD-show script with a 
		
		
Add this line;
		dtoverlay=piscreen,speed=24000000,rotate=270, fps=30
save changes
Pass argument to the kernel;
		sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt
Add following arguments after "rootwait", on the same line;
		fbcon=map:10 fbcon=font:ProFont6x11 logo.nologo
save changes
Reboot the pi. Screen should work now. If you only have the command line, ssh back into the pi to change the boot option;
		sudo raspi-config
Select "Desktop Autologin Desktop GUI, automatically logged in as 'pi' user"
If still white screen, try
		ls -l /dev/input/event*
There should be and event for each input device attached (keyboard, mouse, LCD). Can also identify the input devices with;
		cat /proc/bus/input/devices
If your "Touchscreen" is not listed, might be a hardware problem with the screen.
**Annex B** 
If you have followed the default instructions and completed all steps (1) to (10) above, installing the standard Bitcoin Core v14.x and wish to **only signal UASF/SegWit/BIP148 (without migrating at this stage)** then use Part 1 below.
If you wish to **migrate to BIP148/UASF/SegWit NOW and commit your node to it (not just signal with a flag)**. Then substitute the entirity of part (10) above with this Annex B (part 2), once (part 2) has been completed you may continue to step (11) above and complete the guide. 
**(Part 1)**
In step 10 we install bitcoincore and edit the bitcoin.conf file. Additonal flags can be added here to signal UASF, SEGWIT and BIP148 if desired. Do your research before adding this. I am not endorsing it, this is just showing how. Credit to for mentioning this in the comments.
		nano bitcoin.conf
If step 10 is completed it will look like
		rpcuser=bitcoinrpc
		rpcpassword=yourpasswordhere
add the line below to show support for BIP148.
		rpcuser=bitcoinrpc
		rpcpassword=yourpasswordhere
		uacomment=UASF-SegWit-BIP148
save, exit, reboot node.
If on for before 1st August 2017 BIP148 is activated successfuly (Part 2) should be incorporated.
Thanks to **(Part 2)** Installing Bitcoin Core v0.14.1 UASF-Segwit:0.3(BIP148) credit to for answering my questions and giving a few corrections.
We start with
	mkdir ~/bitcoinData
then enlarge the swapfile so the blockchain loads quicker
	sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile
And change the default size of 100
	CONF_SWAPSIZE=100
To 1000
	CONF_SWAPSIZE=1000
save, exit, ctrl+o ctrl+x
Then, to build the new swap file...
	sudo dphys-swapfile setup
	sudo dphys-swapfile swapon
This one liner will download and install the packages we will need for Bitcoin Core v0.14.1 UASF-Segwit:0.3(BIP148):
	sudo apt-get install autoconf libevent-dev libtool libssl-dev libboost-all-dev libminiupnpc-dev -y
As we installed Raspbian Jessie Lite you'll need to install git:
	sudo apt-get install git -y
make a directory to download the files
	mkdir ~/bin
	cd ~/bin
then download Bitcoin Core v0.14.1 UASF-Segwit:0.3(BIP148) via
	wget 
then extract the compressed files
	
	tar -xzf v0.14.1-uasfsegwit0.3.tar.gz
Then navigate to where the files have been extracted to
	cd bitcoin-0.14.1-uasfsegwit0.3
And begin Install
	./autogen.sh
	./configure --enable-upnp-default --disable-wallet
	make  **see note below **                
**Note** the guide says to use 'make -j2' as the command but I encountered an error. It recommends using just 'make' if errors occur and this worked fine but installed slower. Took around 10mins.
	sudo make install
then we configure the node.
	nano bitcoin.conf
and add to it
	rpcuser=bitcoinrpc
	rpcpassword=yourpasswordhere
save, exit, ctrl+o ctrl+x
Then we run it!
	bitcoind -datadir=/home/pi/bitcoinData -daemon
It will then connect and download/verify blocks, sadly this will take around 4weeks in total, such is the size of the blockchain
To verify it's working use
	bitcoin-cli -datadir=/home/pi/bitcoinData getnetworkinfo
check you have at least 8 connections (after giving it 5 mins to start and get them) and each time you use that command, the value of "blocks": xxxxx should be increasing. That is your current block height. It will get slower later on as blocks start filling with transactions.
To keep this running in the background I keep a screen open.
Although this takes around 4 weeks to sync, the webpage you've told it to display will be running fine. So at least it will look nice :)

Short answer I believe is yes.
Because the 2 is slower, syncing the block-chain may take a very long time. My 3B took just shy of 4 weeks. And because of the 1GB of RAM I've heard bootstrapping doesn't work well as a solution to that as it's too memory intensive. Perhaps changing the memory split in sudo raspi-config (giving more memory to the cpu and less to video) could help it along aswell as enlarging the swapfile in the guide.
But hell if it's just sitting there to be used. Why not?
@_date: 2017-05-19 21:11:38
Thanks Luke, I hope this helps others too.
@_date: 2017-05-19 18:42:49
Thanks for your input, it's definately helping with understanding. Other BIP info is hard to come by.
This makes this next and final part (I think) just 2 questions.
Why then do people care about uacomments at all with regards to BIP148 if the segwit is compatible with all bitcoincore nodes post v13.1. Segwit blocks can be mined and nodes won't reject the blocks because they would be seen to follow the rules.
And how do to you enable a node to accept a block that follows a different BIP (I'll continue to use 107 as an example). I'm assuming a different version of core would need to be coded?
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:19:36
Added. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-05-19 20:47:07
Wow, this has been a real eye opener. Just goes to show how poor some of the information is out there. I'd been following advise to add the uacomment tag/flag without really understanding how insignificant it is. So disregarding the second part of those questions as BIP107 is very unlikely to happen, and focusing on the first regarding BIP148 it seems I'd better configure my node properly rather than just gesture my intentions I'll install the UASF/BIP148/SegWit node and commit to this properly.
Thanks so much for your time, you must be busy.
For my raspberry pi node I've googled my next steps and it seems logical to delete my standard core node, but keep the blockchain, and pull
		wget 
		tar -xzf v0.14.1-uasfsegwit0.3.tar.gz
		cd bitcoin-0.14.1-uasfsegwit0.3
		./autogen.sh
		./configure
		make
		sudo make install
then configure the bitcoin.conf as standard
then the usual
		bitcoind -datadir=/home/pi/bitcoinData -daemon
to get it started and 
		bitcoin-cli -datadir=/home/pi/bitcoinData getinfo
to check it works
(I usually post my thinking in-case it helps someone else searching for something similar)

Yeah a simple point but effective. I actually kind of agree.

So that it cooled it-self down properly, instead of cutting power to the antminer I would have it on a separate ethernet switch and cut the power to the switch. Then without internet the antminer should just idle until internet is restored (switch powered on).
I can't find a number for the idle power consumption when not hashing. But it would just be the control board and two 12v fans. I don't expect much.
Should make the unit last alot longer than experiencing blackouts every day. I can't say how profitable it would be though. Ok so you're not paying for electricity but ROI would take a while. Give it a go, see what happens.

Yeah the swap runs from the HDD.
I'm having USB hub problems at the moment with a Pi on another project. Every time I plug another device int the hub it's killing the power (or it at least dips) to a HDD. Are you plugging anything else into the hub periodically (like a phone charger) that could be causing your HDD to drop out?
@_date: 2017-07-11 17:54:12
I'm no way an network expert but leave everything to UPnP where possible, it makes life so much easier.
However there are plenty of port opening guides around if UPnP isn't possible and a confidence check with canyouseeme.org is good.
Maybe the node crashing has been your router closing the port all this time

In bitseed FAQ they say
     Can I build Bitcoin Core from source myself?
    Yes. You can download the Bitcoin source code from Github and follow the instructions for Unix/Linux Ubuntu. All standard dependencies should already be installed on Bitseed. The resulting binaries for bitcoind and bitcoin-cli should be place in the home directory /home/linaro.
So it's linux based. In which case follow my guide

Ok, so this is a bitcoin node, (nodes make sure that the bitcoin miners are following the rules when mining blocks, and nodes also spread the transactions across the network for miners to pickup and find to include) nodes are important.
There are companies out there where you can buy nodes, but they can be costly. So I've shown step-by-step how to make one with a raspberry pi.
To my knowledge there are even fewer nodes available to buy that have displays. Whilst it is not essential, I found the off the shelf nodes to look rather boring. Just a black box with some wires and a flashing light. The display in this unit is showing bitcoin price and live(-ish) transactions scrolling across the screen so it can be placed on a desk (or anywhere as it's WiFi enabled) to glance at or be a talking point (hey what's that?)
The next part is why I've re-posted this. At the moment there is a big argument about scaling bitcoin. The 1MB blocks containing transactions are full, thus limiting the network. There are thousands of transactions waiting to be confirmed. One proposed solution is by a method called SegWit (which is something to look at yourself, too long winded to type here) but for SegWit to become active some rules of the network need to be changed to let miners make segwit blocks and they be accepted (this comment is ELI5 and simplified). So....the rules of the network need to change to allow us to progress, therefore nodes need to change to accept these new rules, as they are the enforcers of the rules. This guide shows in Annex B how to set up this node so it is prepared for these new SegWit blocks.
Hope that helps

Nearly, but the 375GB PiDrive wouldn't fit in that case. (everything else would)

Yes I transferred everything. I was reading lots of other guides as I was building this and there were comments on this increasing the read/write performance. I also only had the 4GB card provided with the Pidrive so as I was getting tight on space it solved that issue too. I can't put a figure on how quickly read/write speeds may have been affected, this was just to increase the life of the unit.
@_date: 2017-07-08 11:53:03
I would be cautious with that information. It was posted originally in 2013 with the answer you're referring in 2014. There have been vast changes in raspbian since.
And to solve your confusion yes they are different things.
/etc/dphys-swapfile is where the config file is to tell it how big a swap-file to make.
/var/swap is the actual location of the swapfile that is built.
As for the SD card bit, it would be on the card if we hadn't copied everything to the HDD with the adafruit helper. Becuase we moved everything it should now be on the HDD.
If you're new to raspbian it can be a bit of a maze. I would suggest using WINSCP. I've got a screenshot at the bottom of my "getting started" page  
It displays everything like a windows filesystem so it's more familiar. You can also drag and drop files to make things less command intensive.
You can also, using WINSCP go to /var/ and see the swapfile, it's size will match what you told it to be in /etc/dphys-swapfile. 
You log into winscp using the same ssh details.
@_date: 2017-07-11 23:05:20
I don't think you HAVE to use 8333. Leave that for the laptop and use 8334 or whatever instead. 
You've seen the messages in the log file. It broadcasts it's IP to known nodes (ip.ad.res.s:port) and waits for a message back. The other nodes will talk back on whatever ip and port you talked out on.
check out 
That lists every node on the network, most are 8333, probably as most people have UPnP, but go through the list and you'l stop a few that use other ports but are still discover-able to the network.
Your IP changing shouldn't matter either, unless static everyone generally changes every 24hrs and my nodes been running for months without issue.
@_date: 2017-07-07 22:41:30
Without knowing more I would guess that it wasn't running from the HDD, the SD card becoming full would kill the node. Then disabling the swapfile gave it another GB untill it crashed again.
To check the adafruit helper moven the filesystem to the hdd to boot use...
      sudo blkid -o export /dev/sda1
This lists your drives labels and addresses. Select and copy this long number as you may need it in this next bit. You need to check that the PARTUUID long number (that's the USB), is entered into
      sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt
And ensure that the helper has changed the section
     root=PARTUUID=randomnumbershere
And what follows the = should be your PARTUUID number. If it contains a short string of numbers it's still booting from the SD card, to correct it paste the PARTUUID number you copied a minute ago. In more recent nodes I've made, I've had to do this manually.
I've started adding screenshots to these guides to clarify points on my website.
This step hasn't yet been added to the display nodes guides, for now the screenshots if you need to see the steps can be found here  at the last bit of step 5
@_date: 2017-07-09 13:10:17
Yeah the flashing red light was indicating low power. The new official pi power supply should rectify that.
The issue wouldn't be a coupler it's that each power supply, like the official one is converting mains voltage (110v/220v or whatever it is where you are) to 5v. But it's not exact. The official one usually kicks out 5.3v, and the USB hub one may, (for example) produce 4.9v. However when you plug the hubs USB cable into the Pi the 5.3v and the 4.9v "meet" each other, and that difference causes issues, hence taping off the +5v from the hub to the Pi.
Best case is that you don't need the hub anymore and run it all from one power supple. The official Pi one. Then you should have clean stable power.
@_date: 2017-07-11 22:14:34
Looks like that guy on bitcointalk has a good idea.
By any chance is the node crashing at the same time you've been turning the laptop on? Ports getting allocated to the laptop IP.
@_date: 2017-05-06 12:31:06
Because the bitcoin blockchain is 120GB and SD cards to accomodate that are very expensive.
The whole file system was moved to the HDD as it's better suited to the read/write cycles.

Ok then so the Pi is powered by it's own supply, and the HDD has a sata-&gt;USB adapter, into the hub then into the pi?
I think the most likely issue is a power related one. There are a few things to try.
1) If the power rating of the HDD is correct then you wouldn't need the powered USB hub. The pi official power supply should be 2.5A (check the label). With the drive using approx .5A that should leave plenty of power for the Pi and screen. The raspberry pi is spec'd to supply 0.5A though a USB port.
2) If the hub is required, then the instability could be caused by the Pi having 5v power in from the official adapter AND 5v in also from the pin on the USB hub's cable (from a different power supply) as loads on devices change, so will their input voltages drop/raise and the two will have a potential difference. The Pi does have some internal protection and there may be a condition where this is being used and then crashing. 
My suggestion would be to put a small piece of tape on the USB plug from the USB hub to the Pi that prevents the +5v from the hub going to the Pi, and only allowing data.
which pin to put tape on shown here... 
What style of sata to USB adapter do you have? Or have I misunderstood and the HDD has an enclosure around it?

So next step to remove the line that makes the node autoboot from
sudo nano /etc/rc.local
If you do this and then tell the node to boot on your command it will do it on your screen and you can see any errors that come up.
@_date: 2017-07-09 18:31:26
Honestly I don't know.
I think you said it was a Chinese copy of the Pi? There could be a flaw with it, overheating causing a connection to break on some duff soldering.
That you have the screen working with the pi but no GUI installed shows you haven't followed that guide exactly. Perhaps you've missed one of bitcoins dependencies?
There are so many factors.
How far has it got? How many blocks has it downloaded?
@_date: 2017-07-10 00:45:47
Yes, the GUI is installed in Step 6, well before the bitcoin node part. It will give you a desktop and look nothing like the screenshot you sent the other day.
There are two phases to the GUIs. The one that's not installed (as you've spotted) is the full graphical bitcoin wallet. We install the bitcoin-cli (command line interface) rather than the bitcoin-gui (Graphical user interface) as the graphical one would end up being overlayed over the webpage that is displayed on the screen. The cli runs in the background of the Pi.
The GUI at step 6 that we do install, gives the desktop (looks a bit like windows) with chrome browser and other features.
Don't get me wrong, I really do want to help, but I don't feel I can until you follow the guide cleanly from scratch and carefully. Until then I have no idea what to suggest to add back in to rectify it, as the fault could be at any of the 10 steps you say you've done, and some of them now more than once out of order.
Yes there is a log at  /home/pi/bitcoinData/debug.log
I've avoided it as I've just chased faults to nowhere before, patching and patching faults adding all sorts when the easiest way is to just start again from the beginning.
But I'll say again, I do want to help but I need good information. Start again from clean, step 1, and if it doesn't work at the end we'll have a look at the debug log, but not in it's current state.
@_date: 2017-07-09 17:52:45
I'm kind of lost by what you mean by the node went down. What are you seeing? 0 connections? Rpc errors? Nothing at all (it hangs when you ask the getinfo command and says nothing)?
@_date: 2017-07-08 11:09:20
Ok, I understand your frustrations with this, it sounds like it's being quite time-consuming. I can only justify my thought process in the importance of the swap-file. Maybe this will clear things up.
 
Lists the system requirements of running a full node. It recommends 2GB of RAM for a GUI node. The Pi I'm sure you're aware only has 1GB.
Has a wiki about swap files. There are plenty of descriptions out there and they all say more or less the same thing. There is nothing dodgy or quick-fix about a swap file. Nearly every system these days uses them. Even a windows PC when you plug a USB stick in will ask if you want to use it for "ready boost", that's a swap-file.
But the relevant bits from the swap wiki I linked to is :








Another consideration though, is that if you are not making a node that has a display you may get away with not having a swap-file as not having a GUI will be much less resource intensive. Or as you're leaning towards just trying it without a swap-file. It may be a bit slow, or it may cope perfectly well without it.

@_date: 2017-07-09 22:59:58
Ok well we've covered the basics and it usually comes down to power problems. But in the grand scheme of things I have no idea what the issue is. "Node goes down after 2 mins" doesn't give me anything to work with. I really need an error code or something.
With the small keyboard you're using it's possible a dependency didn't install right. An extra space somewhere in a command could have caused it to fail. And unfortunately unless you can give me a better description of how bitcoin core is failing, I have no more suggestions at the moment. Sorry.
And which steps? Not all of them because 'make' for bitcoin takes about 2 hours to compile. Wipe it and start again properly, using PUTTY.
@_date: 2017-07-09 15:46:24

@_date: 2017-07-08 15:40:51
Oh ok, I think I know what you mean. Most routers use DHCP which automatically allocates a spare IP address when you connect a device to it, like a smartphone or games console or whatever. If the node was turned off then the IP address becomes spare and available to get allocated to something else again. But it really doesn't matter as there are a couple of hundred spare address to re-assign to the node and it will just be given one. Once the IP is assigned, UPnP will work out whether the requested 8333 port is available to allocate to the node. There are even more of those to assign and it will just be given one. 
So long as in the "bitcoind-cli getnetworkinfo" command is coming up with connections, then everything is fine. And your block-count is increasing it's all good.
The router isn't designed to be complicated, it knows the connection request is coming from inside and will do it's job to allow it through. I wouldn't over complicate things with different network  configurations if everything is working now.

A static IP shouldn't be necessary, and most people don't have access to enabling a static IP (it's not a default option provided by your internet provider, mostly available on business accounts or at a cost on request). The easiest way to get around it is to get a hostname, rather than an IP. This can be done for free with  
I've not used it but as I understand it it's completely free if you re-activate every 30 days.
As your IP changes it seeks out other nodes and shares it's info. The IP of good reliable nodes gets shared about from one to the other. Even if your IP changed every day it only takes seconds for the connection to be established. I wouldn't worry.
As for the port most routers allow the connection on 8333 anyway, unless you've set strict firwall rules. If you can log onto your router you may be able to find the node listed in a table somewhere under UPnP as port 8333. If you've got the node working already you can be sure it's connected itself for you and is allowed through.

There is a program called WinSCP that may help you if you have limited linux experience. If you run it on a windows pc for example you ssh into the pi and it displays the linux filesystem as if it were in windows explorer. Mich easier to navigate perhaps.
Then you could delete core v14.0 that way, and go through the install of v14.1. Keeping the blockchain of course. Careful if you have a wallet on it!
I think there is very little benefit upgrading from 14.0 to 14.1 though

I have authy as an extension in chrome so it is also "backed up" on my pc and laptop as authorised devices.
With multi device now blocked, no more devices can be added, but those authorised devices still work and can be used to restore a lost phone for example if needed.
I guess you shouldn't disable multi device until you have a backup prepared.

I've also had this issue with the way it's all been handled. Very much a shouting match between the two proposed solutions, however it took sometime for me to realize that neither of them are ideal and I don't believe a perfect solution currently exists.
The closest to what I think everyone wants is something like Monero which has dynamic block scaling. But even that has its limits and blocks will get quite large eventually, but may be a few years away before it need addressing. 
So do people think the technology exists yet to enable a happy medium?
(I confess I'm not 100% with how lightning is proposed to work, watched the video about it and it was quite complicated)

Raspberry Pi's aren't yet USB 3 capable but the cables are backwards compatible with USB 2 and so should be fine for the data however...
You will have to look carefully at the ssd voltage requirements. ssd's are usually 3.3v, whilst the USB is 5v. I would read up on it first to prevent damage. 
I know those adapter cables don't provide enough power for a 3.5" drive as they don't have the 12v the larger drives require. I was of the understanding they're designed for 2.5" laptop drives.
Are you from the UK? If so I may have a cheap solution.
**edit: reading a little more it may depend on the age of the SSD as to whether it'll want 3.3v or 5v. Apparently 5v is the most recent and more common.

Hi there all,
You've probably seen a couple of my projects here before over the past couple of months and they've been generally well received. It spurred me on to make pinode.co.uk
My plan is to create a library of node building guides, but crucially to maintain them. There is too much obsolete information out there linking to past versions of software, and with raspnode.com no longer maintained as of early 2017, and raspberrypifullnode.com still quoting bitcoins 30GB blockchain size, I've taken it upon myself to have a crack at trying to make a community resource hub for nodes.
I would ideally love for the community to get involved. With the potential size of the task and the knowledge of other users it could be a really rich source of information. But most importantly, people would know where to find it! It's obviously early days, but I've put in a bit of ground-work and there is a decent chunk of content there.
All those interested in helping I've also set up to use as a forum for support and developing ideas. I've bought the domain, but some input in the web design/interface would be appreciated, (perhaps this library becomes a wiki?) but in all it's about time we got this information organised.

Thanks, Ideally I would have some better formatting with the code. I like how it's easy to create the grey boxes for it here on reddit, but I'm restricted at the moment by the free hosting and website builder. I'm hoping someone knows of a better environment to put it. After all, the content is made, it just needs a better format.

Ok, so go back to the boot/config.txt and remove that last line again. It's probably put itself back in somewhere in that next step. I've not got that far yet as I've bee in town. I'm thinking it's not as broken as you think it is. All the drivers are there, it worked, then that line kees getting put back in.

This guide makes a bitcoin node (either core or segwit) and has a display that shows any webpage fullscreen for network information.
My node in the image at the top shows 
Other people have made this node using the guide to show other pages  made by user sir_squizard. 
The guide works. I've had a few thanks from others that have it up and running.
All steps of the guide should be followed. If I were you with entire folders (bin/bitcoin missing I would start again. I've made this node several times and it should take 3hrs from start to finish (the longest part just waiting for it to "make" at the bitcoin stage.
My most up-to-date version is on my website  go there select the node you want and it will be less confusing as there are no annexes. Just start to finish, with some screen-shots to help.
I also strongly recommend using PUTTY for the commands. It lets you use your PC to simply copy and paste from my guide and into the Pi, eliminating any typing errors, which is likely on the small screen and keyboard.

It seems to be a common concern for people, however it doesn't appear to have any built in way of disabling it. 
This list of faq from WD, item 4, is quite surprising:
     4. THE LED IS CONSTANTLY FLASHING AND IS VERY BRIGHT. IS THIS NORMAL? CAN THE BRIGHTNESS BE TURNED DOWN?
     Upon installation or re-selection of the Operating Systems to install, the WD PiDrive device is re-partitioned and formatted. The formatting operation takes a while (~30 minutes or more) and involves a high-level of drive activity that causes the LED to flash constantly. Unfortunately, the LED brightness can’t be changed via software. The light can be blocked/shielded by an enclosure or with a marking pen or piece of opaque tape if desired.
I took their advise and used black marker pen on it and it does dim it considerably. I've also seen images from other people who use black electrical tape to mask it totally. A little crude, but it seems to be the only methods of solving it.
@_date: 2017-06-23 22:15:01
Yeah I see a lot of projects using the intel nuc too, good kit.
As for the Pi case there are so many to choose from. Lots of companies are getting in on making accessories for them so it's worth shopping around. The cheapest will be on aliexpress.com Some are designed to take screens.
Everyone's hardware will be slightly different when they build, and so the case you may need for yours will be different depending on what you use for storage of the blockchain. In my build I used a screen and a PIDrive which allowed me to keep it looking 'naked' and self contained. I'm happy with how it looks, but it's simple and works.
Images of my nodes construction are here

There is a complete list of the hardware used there too and where I bought it from :)
Honestly I don't understand the obsession with the fans and cooling. Unless you overclock it I think it's unnecessary. Fans just add noise so if you're really concerned then just put a heat sink on it. Ebay them they're pennies. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:07:14
So I've made some progress and changes. Following the guide again it behaved a little differently, something that gets downloaded has been updated somewhere probably.
The white screen issue is to do with  /boot/config.txt
There a few functions that cause the 
     dtoverlay=waveshare35a:rotate=270
function to be overpowered by
  
  
    
  dtoverlay=ads7846,cs=1,penirq=17,penirq_pull=2,speed=1000000,keep_vref_on=1,sw$
and so the later one must be either commented out with a # or deleted altogether. If you have a whitescreen issue, take a look at that file and check the last 5 or so lines to make sure it has not added itself back in.
My next step is moving that file system and I'm going to write the section up this time. Even if it is easier to use the adafruit helper I'll list the commands.

So some people want to support the network but don't want to run their electricity bills through the roof mining. So they run a node instead.
Miners create blocks from the transactions following rules. The nodes send the miners transactions to make blocks with and check the created blocks they send back to make sure they've followed the rules and not cheated somehow. 
If you build your own node you can tell it what rules to enforce. This is relevant at the moment due to the scaling debate. This is where SegWit, BIP148 stuff comes in and stops being an ELI5
Nodes do not mine. You do not benefit financially from them. These built on the Raspberry Pi use tiny amounts of power. Cheap to run, Cheap to build.
Nodes, because they hold the ledger of every transaction ever made, can usually be wallets too.
@_date: 2017-06-23 19:21:14
That's something to maybe look into, but not part of the plan. 
A company called [Bitseed]( already does, but they're not that cheap. I also don't know if they ship out of the US.
At this point I don't think I have the business knowledge to sell them. I'm also not certain of the copyright status of the software I use. I think if I were to profit from it, I'd could run into problems. And lastly, although my own nodes have been running for a few months, I'd be in unknown territory with the life of this as a product being on 24/7 constantly writing data. Not sure what guarantee/warranty I could offer.
I mean it's possible. But right now, No.

The Pi's blinking green light is the SD card being read, *** lightbulb moment, and it all clicks, Your node probably wasn't running on the HDD. The ever decreasing time the node was running was probably because the card was full and stopped when it ran out of storage space.
So before it was constantly reading/writing from the SD (bad) it now isn't blinking because it reads from the HDD instead (good) the HDD light should be going crazy.
(that's my best guess now anyway) I'll add this point to the troubleshooting bit of the pinode website, 
@_date: 2017-06-24 09:07:01
Ok, so you mean for a standard mid-range PC that someone is willing to leave turned on for a node? If you mean a different hardware configuration just say. Maybe like an Intel Nuc?
If so that is well documented and maintained by the core team at their site [Running a Full Node Linux, Windows and Mac OS X]( and I can link to them on my page.
I'll try and find a good SegWit one to link to. If not I'll make one for sure.
*Edit: So bitcoin core's guide is beginner friendly and maintained. I see no need at the moment to develop my own guides. Unless a request comes in for a specific environment. I have linked to their guides on pinode.co.uk*

@_date: 2017-06-06 22:47:55
OK, it took me several weeks to come up with the guide. The problems you are having are probably one's I've encountered before.
There are only two bits that I guess can be tricky.
The display:
this is what took the longest to solve. Just about everything that can be read online from other tutorials results in a white screen. I put the project down for a few weeks out of frustration because of it. Eventually I found a combination of drivers that worked, by chance and luck. Hence why I made the guide so others didn't have so much pain. For this reason I strongly suggest you follow the guide exactly. I've had other users send pictures of their completed nodes, so I'm 90% confident these instructions work. 
Once you've got the screen to show a desktop you're on the home straight. After that it's only minor tweeking apart from moving the system over to the HDD. But there is the adafruit helper for that, and it did nearly all the hard work for me. Use their guide but I'll help if I can.
Top tip:
When I made this for the first time I used the win32diskimager software to make many, many backups. Once you complete a section in the guide and it works (before you migrate everything to the HDD), shut the Pi down, put the SD card back into your PC and make an image (as a restore point) and save it on your PC.
Then if it screws up, you can format the card again and load it from when it last worked. I built this whole thing that way, trial and error. But you've got instructions to follow.
As for the Git error, perhaps Git wasn't installed? If you get that again use 
     sudo apt-get install git
to install Git and carry on with the instructions
@_date: 2017-06-23 18:42:20
Yeah it's just another part of the system that makes it run. Not as glamorous as mining, but just as essential.

So I just went to check on my account here and was surprised to see this winding down notice. 
I've just checked my lending stats on poloniex and his bot arranged 3182 loans to margin lenders for me without a hiccup. No losses.
I'm sure there are many others out there with great experiences of this service too. 
As with his service over the year, his wind down proposal seems very fair, and wish him the best of luck with his next project.
For me though, time to look for another bot.

there isn't a screen saver set. I disabled it at stage 8 and should still be diabled on that image file.

Ok. Sounds like you were making progress though. Once the screen works and it's all moved over to the HDD there's very little left to do.
I've got a few bits laying around that will let me build another one of these nodes. So I'll re-build one following this and see if any adjustments need to be made to the commands. As you know that'll take a few hours.
In the mean-time if you got to the chromium bit you're so close. But I've never had chromium crash on me.

After a short search there are a couple that could replace it
As its URL suggests it runs with poloniex. It offers a free service or premium. The summary seems to be that the free account manages your lending once per hour and offers a slightly lower %rate than the premium; which gives a higher % and manages your lending 8 times per hour with "priority lending" whatever that is? Signup is temporarily disabled but looks the closest to the poloniex lending bot, I'll give it a go soon. 
Is another, works with Poloniex, Bitfinex and Quoine? The site looks like it has a lot of fancy features for setting limits and rates, and uses a load of fancy words for what the other sites seem to achieve with drop down boxs. I guess it's nice that it works with a few different exchanges, but I couldn't find their fee system on their page?
I'm sure there are others which could be found with more digging, and on the face of it they all work the same by having API access to your lending, but no access to exchanging or withdrawals. Seems as safe as poloniexlendingbot was. So with the exception of of market/exchange collapse or an exchange security flaw all should be good. Fingers crossed.
