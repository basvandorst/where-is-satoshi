But... but... how would you have a functionally useful and secure Blockchain without bitcoin (or another cryptocurrency)?
@_date: 2016-04-22 23:33:42
Yep, that's the way I understand it too. However this video is very specifically saying that's not the case. They are saying anyone can just make a magic private Blockchain, and somehow that's super valuable. So either I'm misunderstanding something core to Bitcoin, or these people don't know what the heck they are talking about...at all. Can someone who really knows chime in and explain?

@_date: 2018-01-02 02:06:41
Hahah ok fair enough. I’ve tried to get a charity I support to use Coinbase but they have struggled. I was hoping for some alternatives that were geared to charities. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:46:28
Well, with the notable exception of GDAX and Gemini, most other altcoin values are primarily measured in BTC, not USD. That’s probably what they mean.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:09:11
No, it can’t implement LN. They removed the upgrade that supports it. 
Even worse, that upgrade fixed a malleability bug. In effect they re-introduced a bug into BCH that was already fixed in BTC.
You have been fooled. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:44:45
Never sell. Only buy. Problem solved. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:28:21
Ok, for the people who can’t afford Starbucks I’ll concede your point. Don’t buy Bitcoin. Food and shelter is more important. 
Otherwise the people here, including you, need to think differently. 
Did you buy coffee today? Yesterday? Why not Bitcoin instead? And just so you know, I’m eating my own dog food. I’ve replaced my daily coffee buy with a Bitcoin purchase. 
Endless pockets are are what you get when you dollar cost average. The $5 I purchased two weeks ago is now worth $10. Bitcoin is what makes your pockets endless...eventually. 
I don’t consider my thinking naive at all. It’s much more mature than people who think “it’s too expensive now, I can’t afford it.” You can and you should. Do you buy McDonalds? Make a sandwich and buy Bitcoin. Wait 12 months. Your welcome.

That’s because none of those try to unmake Bitcoin into “Bitcoin Core,” none of them try to claim they are the real Bitcoin, and none of them try to trick new users.
It’s not that people feel threatened. It’s that it’s SUPER annoying and false. Fork Bitcoin all you want, but don’t fucking lie about it when you do it.

Bitcoin is here for everyone. It won’t discriminate between 3rd world and 1%. Honey badger don’t care. 
Empowerment is the point. It will be applied wherever it’s accepted. If you want it available for third world folks then get to it and make it happen. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 04:21:43

This is a good point. The Web did have some enemies at the time as well. The publishing industry (think newspapers) and copyright concerns were a big deal and vocal in their opposition back then. However they weren't nearly as powerful as bitcoin's opposition.

@_date: 2017-08-13 19:18:17
You need to be more specific. Saying the CB has far reaching policies is hand waving. The CB can’t control Bitcoin itself, that’s a fact. They can’t control the protocol or change the math. Are you trying to say they can control the laws of what a country can use as legal tender? That they can regulate the markets? Because the CB doesn’t do those thing, the government does. 
Pleas be more specific.

I like bits when it comes to mass adoption. 
It's easier to use in conversation because it's succinct and easy to grok. Think about bits like "bucks." This coffee costs 2 bits. It's less technical and can stand on its own. 
Everything else requires a relation or translation to 1BTC and makes Joe NormalGuy have to think about it too much. People should be able to understand cost and value without have to do a mental conversion.

I think this is close, but not exactly right. I think that banks should be replaced by applications built on top of Bitcoin.
Example: Bitcoins allows you to "be your own bank." Bitcoin isn't the bank, you are. Honestly though, "you" aren't a very good bank. "You" need something else to help you. Hence, applications on top of Bitcoin you can control and use.
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:00:29

@_date: 2017-11-28 04:18:58
I think they all just want to pretend they are Satoshi. Notice how they act like they are owed some kind of homage and invoke “Satoshi’s original vision” and at the same time try to modify it to their own ends?
If Satoshi were still around he would be so pissed off. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:30:53

Ok, if that’s true then you should support segwit because it effectively increases the block size in a more future proof way than just doubling a constant when random emotions feel the need.
Look, we all want Bitcoin to succeed. The engineers and logic are easily the best bet. Not emotions or by invoking the art of economics. 
In this space, sound code and architecture = truth.

Sidechains will extend Bitcoin, but the Bitcoin protocol itself will never match or improve Ethereum by design. Doing that would essentially change Bitcoin in something else and at the same time reduce Bitcoin's security to an unacceptable level. We will never see issues like Ethereum experienced with the DAO, and if we do that means Bitcoin will have failed.

A blockchain is merely a singly linked list with hash linkages. There is nothing earth shattering about it. You already would have studied that when you earned your CS degree. Correct?
Your original response to seemed to claim that blockchain was useful on it’s own, like a database. Reading back though maybe I read into it too much. However, when you cited use cases that changed things like algorithms, when we were only discussing blockchain, seems to further my assumption though. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:02:21
That’s not what they said. Irreversible transactions are a feature, but the ease of theft is not a feature. Ideally the system should be able to make theft more difficult. If you are tech savvy you can make your coins pretty secure, if you are not tech savvy then you are an easy target. I think security changes will need to happen before we see mass adoption.

This is the way Bitcoin behaves. If you decide to stay in it you will feel the same way several times until you get used to it. You will also feel the exact opposite when it jumps, euphoric, until you get used to it.
The best advice I can give you is to put it into cold storage and forget about it for a while. It will be hard, but if you can manage to do that you will likely make future-you super happy.
I was there when it went from a few hundred all the way to $1200 and back down again to 200 for months. If you believe in Bitcoin then hold on and wait.

This is a fundamental misunderstanding. Whomever started this “Blockchain not Bitcoin” mantra should be ashamed. The people who parrot it should feel the same way once they actually understand.
Any computer scientist worth their salt will tell you that the blockchain data structure existed long before Bitcoin and its implementation is great in certain scenarios and absolutely horrible in others. Bitcoin is one of those scenarios where the blockchain excels when combined with several other technologies. Actually, that entire combination is literally the definition of Bitcoin. If you pull the blockchain out and try to leverage it on its own the use case is awful.

It means you can fix your fee mistake later, after you already sent the transaction. However I don't see any way to set custom fee's before you send a transaction in Breadwallet currently.
RBF is replace-by-fee. [Read this thread to understand RBF.](
CPFP is Child pays for Parent. [Read this thread to understand CPFP.](
I don't recommend the other wallets on iOS that let you change fees because I find them a lot worse than Breadwallet in general, even without fee customization.
On Mac I only recommend Trezor or Bitcoin-Qt (Bitcoin Core).

This is the way Bitcoin behaves. If you decide to stay in it you will feel the same way several times until you get used to it. You will also feel the exact opposite when it jumps, euphoric, until you get used to it.
The best advice I can give you is to put it into cold storage and forget about it for a while. It will be hard, but if you can manage to do that you will likely make future-you super happy.

Dude, you are conflating things. Stop it. The innovation is putting the technologies together. Do you understand that? When you say "blockchain tech" you give yourself away. I understand the disparate technologies that make up Bitcoin perfectly well, I'm not some corpy client drone that you can sound smart in front of by picking up a technology verbiage stick and swinging it around. 
The real definition of blockchain is "a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography." That's it! This is nothing more than a linked list where the links are hashes. It's not new. 
If you are going to include PoW, why don't you call it "Hashcash tech?" Make it distributed? Call it "P2P Tech!" Those are just as accurate as "blockchain tech." When you start adding more to it you are extending it to become something else. Extend it far enough and you get Bitcoin, where all this started.


You're literally talking about Bitcoin, not "blockchain tech." Go back to consultant-land where skewing concepts works. Here in we know better.

Nah, not really when you compare it to "other methods." Only when when you compare it to VISA or ACH. If you compare it to writing a check or a cash transaction it's actually quite expensive.

But the motivation needs to be a reward of something that has value. So a currency token wouldn’t be arbitrary at all. In fact it would really be the best model. I think that’s why cryptocurrency is proving successful.

Dude, stop being literally Hitler. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 01:04:33
OK, I like your reasoning. My problem with your angle is is that to secure the chain you need to do something that will inherently cost something. Work (electricity) and Stake (money) are the big ones in crypto right now. People spend electricity or money to secure the chain.
Maybe you are referring to "spending time" as a cost? And the reward would be the content you get while spending the time? When you do that work successfully you expect to be rewarded. Hence why money works best. It's always worth "something." Content in an app might be good, but it might also be bad. Writing could be poor, gameplay could be bad. When the reward isn't valuable then people will stop doing the work to secure the chain.
Also, when the chain becomes centralized (like in the mastercard case) then the work being done might actually become more rewarding when it's used to remove security from the chain. Then the whole thing falls apart.
@_date: 2017-09-16 12:28:45

In the past people have lost bitcoins because they have kept them on exchanges and services that have gone under (Google the Mt. Gox story). Technically, if you don't have access to the private keys of your coins, you don't control/own them. An exchange can lock them to remain solvent if they are having trouble, or a hacker can rob the exchange. You won't be able to transfer them out if that happens. 
In the case of Coinbase they technically own the coins and you just have an IOU from them until you move them into a wallet you control. Coinbase will probably not go under, but they tend to have service outages when things get volatile. This leads people to distrust them. 
It may seem like people are over reacting, but in several cases people have lost coins that, at the current price, would be changing their lives right now. No one wants to get burned like that again.

No, they are different. They have their own chains and will trade to whatever coins an exchange will allow. They are independent of Bitcoin, but typically tend to track the price direction of Bitcoin because it has the most market capitalization.

No one here cares what Mark Cuban thinks about Bitcoin. He's just leeching attention off of it like KimDotCom. Neither of them offer any value to the crypto world.

Yes! You did! I work in North Chicago, or as other people call it, “The Middle of Nowhere.” ;)

Yes, and this is exactly what he is doing. Trying to leech off the Bitcoin wave. Sad.

Yep, you're welcome. Not to be pedantic, but Bitcoin and other cryptos are perfectly legal the vast majority of the world.  Some countries are even recognizing them as currency now (as opposed to property). It's the acts that you do with them that can be illegal. Same with the dollar, euro, pound, etc.
