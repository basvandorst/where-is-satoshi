I'm pretty sure you can get all the meat you want.
If you don't speak Dutch and used Google Translate, those were just some examples ;)
Otherwise, my sarcasm detector failed...

I'm Dutch and we can use company's like Bitonic.nl to instant buy Bitcoins with iDeal, which is something like Paypal only for instant bank2bank transfers, free, and non-refundable.
If you are not Dutch, Bitstamp might be a great 2nd choice :)

Actually, in Holland we have instant consumer2business bank transfers. I could buy dozens of bitcoins with a single click now and receive them right away. The only information they require is a mobile phone number and a bitcoin address to receive the coins. :)

They are more expensive yes, but they are the most easy and friendliest way to buy Bitcoin.
And if you are holding for long term those couple euro's don't matter anyway.

It should take about 45-60 minutes max, but really depends on the exact locations since traffic can be heavy around Amsterdam.
Which is quite funny, I have to drive 250km and get there in 2.5 hours, you'd have to drive one hour for 60km ;)

As long as the transaction has an fee I wouldn't worry about confirmations.

Seems pretty positive so far.

Totally agree. I already made it my goal to make sure ever major purchase I am gonna make I will convince the merchant to accept Bitcoin.
For example I am already browsing for a new car, when I've made my choice I will give the dealer 2 options: 
1. Accept Bitcoin without risk (thanks to Bitpay and others) and welcome me as a new customer, and perhaps many others to follow.
2. Decline and lose me as a customer.
Car industry is having some really bad time here in the Netherlands, I bet it won't take much convincing.

You need a dutch bank account to use iDeal. So if you have that it doesn't matter where you live.

I asked him to resend with a fee this time and he did.
I was one of the few lucky, it was the owner of  who ended up scamming alot of people.

Might be an idea to put the info pages on Github or something and let the community work on it.
Just let someone be in charge of the merge requests.

I'd rather see the title changed to: "450+ BTC stolen because of weak passwords" :)
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:01:48
It's a two hour and half hour drive for me, but I'll try to be there too!
The Dutch keep embracing Bitcoin ;)
@_date: 2014-01-16 08:44:23
Yes. The post explicitly tells that Dutch laywer Plasman isn't allowed to accept Bitcoin anymore.

The actual "Masters of Universe" documentary is different than the "tegenlicht" episode right?
@_date: 2014-01-31 17:18:43
I once received an transaction without a fee. After a couple days the transaction also disappeared off the blockchain, nowhere to be found. The transaction id couldn't be found anymore.

Depends. Currently their price is only 5 euro's higher (465 vs 460) than Kraken.com for example. Yesterday it was about the same.
Unless you want to trade bitcoins with advanced market options Bitonic.nl is _the_ way to buy Bitcoins in the Netherlands.
@_date: 2014-01-25 14:08:49
Try to contact Bitonic.nl
They often buy large amounts of Bitcoins and pay within a day to your SEPA address.
You might wanna email them in English because the site is Dutch.
Currently 200 bitcoins is 113K euro.

This comes at exactly the right time.
I almost finished all aspects of my Node.js app except the bitcoin integration!
@_date: 2014-01-10 20:31:09
0% transaction fees :)

That's assuming he hold 100% of the Satoshi Dice shares, which he didn't.
