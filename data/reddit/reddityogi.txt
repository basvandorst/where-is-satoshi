Ensure that you can recover the small amount of coin before moving everything.

They decide if and when to give you the forked coins.

Pardon by dumbness. Does this refer to bitcoin cash?

Your old phone had all the 2FA private keys (secret code). Is there any away you can resurrect your phone? If it is a rooted android, there is a way to pull the Google Authenticator database. 
Else, you will have to check with each site to see if they have a way to unlock your account (Maybe SMS?) or submit a ticket to verify it's you.
Next time on, keep a backup of the QR code or secret key.

If just the password was enough to login to Gemini and hypothetically push the notification, how is this 2FA?

Just bought mine yesterday from an authorized reseller Coinfort.co . Shipped it the same day. Highly recommend.
You can pay in bitcoin and get $10 off. Ledger nano S for $75 with free shipping! FTW!

Sorry about your situation. But I'm unable to comprehend how you got the Authy notification and how they were able to get your 2FA secret. 
I use google auth so I'm not really sure how they can decode the 2FA secret using 1 OTP.
