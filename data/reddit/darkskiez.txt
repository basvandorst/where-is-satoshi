True, they need to not make a crappy site, but, the news page is being actively exploited right now. I thought going for that would be more likely that getting them to take down the whole site and audit it.

Go to blockchain.info and paste in your address that you were expecting them to be sent to, you should see the balance there. :-)

You dont have a 10minute window to double spend, you need to do it nearly simultaneously. You wouldn't bother with two vendors though, you would just craft a payment back to yourself and transmit each transaction to different peers. Its also possible to detect attempts to do this at the time and raise a red flag. See blockchain.info they have a double spend attempt list. Native clients could add warning about this as a feature.

you could buy bitcoins with them and then sell them for $ :)

be careful, you may have unencrypted backups of your wallet that are still vulnerable

Mars varies between 54.6 million km and 401 million km from earth, with an average distance of 225 million km. 
This is 3 minutes to 22 minutes with an average of 12 minutes at light speed.
For bitcoin mining to work on mars, it would need to download the latest block, solve it and upload back to earth before a block had been found on earth, which would double the time.  This means mars has an average 24 minute block solving penalty.
But it would rely on miners on earth and have an average 24 minute latency extra on top of normal transaction verification.
More likely they'd just run a fork, Marscoin I guess.

Thanks, I wasn't going to go through all the sign up faff to try to talk to the support guys.

I don't use it myself other than to experiment, but it sounds like you've described blockchain.info
1. it sends you encrypted backups via email every change you make, you don't need to remember.
2. it requires a password
3. It has a local currency setting and switches all displays in and out of your local currency with one click
4. it keeps the blockchain.
it also emails you if there have been any transactions received or sent!

Look through their wikipedia articles. They trash it all the time, and of course everyone agrees that wikipedia is as useless as bitcoin :)

Basically, no, because the risk of fraud with anything not bitcoin is so high. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:11:51
Looks like this thread has made it to a journalist that isn't keen on bitcoin.

Double spends with blockchain forks are not permanent. When the next block is mined its lineage is longer and one of the double spends is reversed.
@_date: 2013-04-21 23:58:28
Agree 100%
@_date: 2013-04-21 18:37:47
Good idea:

Someone should contact btc-e and get him to shutdown the news part of the site!

You don't have to be playing with a single deck :)

I have been thinking along the same lines, I think its a great idea, basically using bitcoin as a peer to peer, currency neutral, secure, free payment network. You load up your wallet in your local currency, and you can spend it anywhere in the world in whatever currency they want. Once the value stabilises and whole supply chains start getting denominated in it, people will be happier and happier to use it natively.

The bitcoin network treats the longest blockchain as the authoritive transaction list. If you transmit a double spend, up to half the nodes will see one and half will see the other. When the next block is mined, it will come from a node on either half, and that block contains the list of valid transactions, the nodes which saw the other transaction will invalidate it, and adopting the single unified list. This also does not affect other transactions because they were likely accepted and included by all nodes on the network.

It's not a monet either.

Can you make the empty listing categories not show up, or a browse all option please.

Just wanted to add, Green Addresses can be used for higher-trust fast confirmation.

Seems to be an XSS bitcoin transfer of sorts, looks like its stolen a bunch already, has this address in it..

A lot of the perceived downsides of BTC are from people who don't understand the design decisions or implications of the changes. If you change some of these things you will be bitten somewhere else.
Most requirements can be added to BTC, in a network compatible way, via client software updates.
It is my personal opinion that creating lots of alternatives will hurt the adoption as a whole at this stage, and will be used as a divide and conquer approach by parties interested in stifling it.

When you deposit and withdraw from mtgox, you dont get the same coins, it just goes into one pot.
They'll register the deposits into your address but the balance on that address is not yours.
Does that make any sense?
