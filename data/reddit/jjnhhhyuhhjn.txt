Best way is to open a euro bank account. You can then use it to interact with euro exchanges without any fees. Some options are fire.com and bunq.com and revolut.com. good euro exchanges are  kraken.com and bitstamp.net or gdax.com (or any euro exchanges).. now to convert between euro and GBP you will need an FX service there are many such as TransferWise.com, currencyfair.com, azimo.com or again revolut.com. The FX services are cheap and the euro account should not add any fees so you end up with a very efficient pipeline that including all fees should be able to get you BTC for just under 1%.

You won't find such a service. There is Abra payments but they don't support banks in India or the UK meaning you have to find cash dealers on both ends. There really aren't any good exchanges with GBP banking, so you need to either take your chances with local bitcoins or open a euro bank account (handy to have anyway).. two good ones are fire.com and bunq.com.. also revolut.com. 
 these are some Indian exchanges.. I don't know anything about buying in India. 
I suspect that there are very probably better ways to do what you want without involving bitcoin.. maybe ask some of your Indian classmates.. generally two FX trades are more expensive than one (is, into BTC and out again) and also the fact that UK bank accounts can't really interact with BTC without either using swift or converting to euros. That said I do expect it's possible to do and might be an interesting experiment.. I doubt it will be any cheaper than whatever workaround Indians in the UK normally use and it is likely to be slower and involve opening far more accounts on different services and just more steps to do.
