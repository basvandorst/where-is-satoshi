How do you know others were fooled?
What were they fooled into? Whats the gain?

You had me until "why would anyone spend".
It hurts my fingers to type the blatently obvious: because people need stuff. Do you really think I'll skip education so that I can keep my bitcoin? I won't eat? Live on the street?
If all that the deflation prevents is consumption just for the sake of spending, then by all means, bitcoin is what the world needs.

Well, that doesn't add up, does it? If you're willing to get rid of your inflationary currency anyways, then why not put it all in Bitcoin, and then spend from there if you need?

Yummy, soo much antifragility!

I can't believe you're getting downvoted. 
Especially in northern European countries people pay taxes with pride. They do something for their fellow citizens. Is it really so had to see that police/education/infrastructure/safety nets and all these are good things for society - and the best way is to pay for them collectively?
I understand the problems other countries have - i.e. in the US where a huge chunk of the taxes goes into defense (against no enemies basically). And corruption is widespread and basically legalized. 
So change is needed - but the solution is how to use taxes - not to get rid of them.

But thats where you contradict yourself. You say you want to spend only your "dollar". But now you say you rather want to keep it for stability.
I'm even skeptical about your volatility claim. If in this scenario bitcoin would be 10k or even 100k per item, then it would be much more reliable. Especially compared to highly inflationable currencies. Look at the pesos and co.


Heh, "of markets" lets say. :D And even that is questionable.

You're losing track of what we're talking about by adding details. My point was that you already said you're spending. And you're saying you would spend fiat (because bitcoin prevents spending), but then you say you rather keep the fiat (because fiat is stable). Can't do both.
Your idea only makes sense in a world where the deflationary currency is sparse (i.e. dollar in South America). You would there of course keep the dollar if you can spend your pesos. Bitcoin is different - it can be bought/sold/transfered by anyone (especially in our future scenario). 
So your history books are correct about the past - but not about this unseen future.
In a world with 100k per bitcoin, and them keeping rising in value, nobody knowing that would keep fiat (at the most as a small hedge).
Spending overall would go down - but only for goods one didn't really need anyways.






Reliable both in price and in safety. Volatility sinks with adoption. If half the world uses bitcoin then it would be harder for any whale to make the market swing. By then bitcoin would be mature - thus safer, and not easily be banned.
The claim inflation=stable just seems odd to me. Maybe textbooks say that, but any real life example I can think of says other wise. Inflation correlates with instability. Any super stable currency (Deutsche Mark before Euro) had very little inflation, so that it even became a problem.
And nobody in their right mind has kept more inflationary currencies for some stability reason.
