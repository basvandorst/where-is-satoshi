To be honest, some of what they say is true. Right at this moment for the average American family bitcoin  shouldn’t be invested in, at least not a lot. Its all over the place and as they say; this is a project. Id hate for someone who is uneducated in the subject to hear a financial advisor tell him to buy in and he loses 3k in 24 hrs. Idk its a gamble.

Theres your problem. From my experience its a good service. But buy through the gdax. Wayyyy cheaper
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:31:16
Lol wrong. They technically don’t have to protect you. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:07:15
Lol �� no let them sell. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:25:51
If you plan on using coinbase you wont make crap with the fees. Make a coinbase account then move the money and trade on gdax. Best of luck
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:21:57
Yeah nice try man
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:24:07
Yes sell! Ill gladly buy them hahahaha

Hey thats a good thought. From my understanding ln will be useful for businesses do large multi transactions so small businesses or small transactions may not get any support.

Was thinking this the other day, gotta plan my trip to Amsterdam... you know for them educational purposes

Fuck em. They’ll be fine if they stop blowing it on wars. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:04:51
Atm’s? First time hearing this. Who is paying for those
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:37:57
Okay? But litecoin is way cheaper than bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:37:09
You do you man. Others will tell you to leave it and forget it. But this is a PROJECT very easy for it to hit the fan. BUT DONT FREAK... they smell fear...
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:40:14
I haven’t. Possibly be something else you did? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:20:38
Never buy on the up. Buy when people are panicking. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:29:27
No on bitcoin but on litecoin I cant lie its nice to use
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:51:29
Maybe this will return with the lightning network? Hope so cause bitcoins speed is either gonna be fixed or is gonna be our noose. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:38:03
Its up to you. But remember its a PROJECT very easy to hit the fan. BUT DONT FREAK... they smell fear...
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:33:21
Good one captain obvious. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:28:15
Adjust the tinfoil hat. Your getting bad signals. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:22:47
Haha knock on wood. But in all seriousness don’t say that or you’ll have newbies pissing their pants ����
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:08:18
Id contact them with this info. That being said it may take a couple days
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:29:00
I believe you go to deposit and should be under the wire selection. Haven’t used this way yet but i believe that it. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:41:06
Thats true. Tbh I think I am just looking at Roi. If I start the business and make some green can I take that and but more bitcoin and it be worth more than just jumping in now. Am i explaining this correctly?
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:10:34
It is worrying and lots of people are asking this. For bitcoin to remain on top it need lightning to work. If not it doesn’t look good. Imo
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:30:54
And make sure to keep up with the tech thats happening so you know whats happening. For instance the lightning network and wall street.  Could help you for-see the dips and rises. Best of luck 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:34:16
Only if the lightning network falls short of expectations. Not a hater I have bitcoin and litecoin.

If you think the governments of the world don’t piss money away your crazy. I picture my government as a spoiled child who has been dropped on his head half a dozen times and then given a check book.

The gods have spoken
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:42:23
How do you know when to though? Like sell off. What if you miss a 20% increase and it dips only 5%
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:34:08
Can confirm. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 03:30:32
Actually there ate times where I loved going to the bank... but I get your point. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:32:50
Fk haven’t  thought about this. Selling! 
@_date: 2018-06-01 17:38:32
I have done this before though ���� was writing some code zoned out and had some weird ass Frankenstein in front of me 10 mins later. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 19:15:30
Yeah once I realized what ive done I redid it all. It was pretty clear where I started fkin up
@_date: 2018-03-23 12:31:57
Freedom to be tracked with ease. Some cool things about it but is it really the best it could be? 
@_date: 2018-03-23 00:11:21
Good one. My point exactly. People dont care about bitcoin I feel and havent thought about it at all. Rather just its worth a few grand. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 00:12:20
Why bother with bitcoin at all then? Its all very interesting...
@_date: 2018-04-08 18:53:05
Yeah the bible predicted blockchains. Its right after the part where they stone they gays, cant miss it

As a business owner ill go ahead and say PayPal is a fucking nightmare to deal with and I am waiting for the day I can drop it. I still think crypto has to improve more and become more adopted before its used but yeah... fk paypal
