We need to have miners wherever electric heaters are used.
Then people won't mine for profit, but only when they need the waste heat anyway, and just to get some crypto-coins back for their energy bill.
Also it will become *less* important then to have the latest generation mining hardware, as mining revenue is not the primary motive to switch on such a heater.
That way, big mining farms that can't make use of the waste heat (probably won't at big scale, heat dissipates quickly) won't be able to stay in business anymore.

you could argue the "intrinsic value" is the security of the network, and to be able to use it for seemingly non-monetary things like immutable hashes of data / timestamps.
though of course the security comes from the incentives which require a coin; in my experience this is the most difficult thing for people to understand that there is this circular reasoning (you can transfer value because the network has value; in order for the network to have value it needs to have a unique feature that wasn't there before in previous computer networks, which is to securely transfer value in a trust-minimized way), but this happened organically in the bootstrapping process, symbolized by first the bitcoin pizza.

BTSC seems to be a company that *uses* Bitcoin and offers services around it. It is not Bitcoin itself.
Just like Amazon or Cisco are companies that *use* the internet. They're not the internet itself.
Bitcoin is a neutral software protocol, a standard, that happens to be usable also as a digital currency and store of value. There is no company or other organization behind it. Much like Email or the internet itself. No one owns "Email" or "the internet". In fact Bitcoin wants to become *the internet of value*.
If you want to buy bitcoins, you can download a Bitcoin wallet app to your phone and meet someone on the street, give them cash, and they will send their bitcoins from their phone to your phone. If that is too inconvenient for you, there are services and exchanges online where you can buy bitcoins: 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:59:50
it's not a stock, it's not "publicly traded" in the sense like with regular stock markets. Everyone can set up a booth on the streets and trade bitcoins against cash, or set up a website for that purpose. And that's what happens and there are many.
Bitcoin (capital B) is a global borderless uncensorable permissionless non-bureaucratic decentralized value transfer system that no one controls, it's p2p software. (It's also meant to be near-instant and near-free with negligible transaction fees, but we're currently in a phase of experiencing growing pains. A 2nd layer called Lightning Network to alleviate those problems has been developed and is going live just about these days.)
Because Bitcoin is a pure software protocol that doesn't know of the outside world, it has its own tokens to be used to transfer value. These tokens are the bitcoins (small letter b).
They are limited in amount (21 million, divisible with 8 decimal places after the point) and useful, hence valuable. The value comes from supply and demand, from people speculating how the whole Bitcoin network as a value transfer system (and it can do much more if you heard about the "blockchain") is worth now and in the future. If the network proves to be secure and useful for people this would increase inelastic demand for the bitcoin tokens.

the narrative that bitcoin addresses and the blockchain are public shouldn't be used.
better fungibility and privacy are important topics on the roadmap of the next ongoing development.
if satoshi would have known how to do bitcoin more private (without scalability tradeoffs) he would have done it. likely he would have chosen the mimblewimble approach had he known about it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:34:59
cryptocurrencies are overhyped currently in the hope of becoming true native "internet money", but we found the technology research doesn't keep up with the expectations fast enough.
blockchains just don't scale. to believe this data structure of writing every coffee transaction into thousands of nodes across the world being able to compete with paypal and visa is ludicrous.
bitcoin is in a phase of serious changes. fast instant transaction will happen offchain on a second layer and will practically have no fees. but it will require most of the eco-system to adopt this lightning network.

yes, it has not much to do with schnorr, but the wizards told me you'll in principle be able to do mimblewimble as a transaction type in bitcoin directly (without an altcoin or a sidechain) with all the goodness and features that are coming like taproot, bulletproofs, and coinjoin techniques.
(won't be mandatory and by default though, as it is in a true mimblewimble coin, but still, there should be incentive to use that transaction type because of lower fees i guess)

There would still be a chain of transactions but no blocks. Each transaction would be propagated to the whole network just as in Bitcoin. Once m out of n nodes with a stake of at least x have seen it and confirmed it's not double-spent, the transaction can be seen as confirmed by all nodes. There's no need to build blocks.    
There are also other options of how to organize the data store. It could be implemented similarly as the Ripple/Stellar consensus as well, which keeps track of accounts and balances rather than building a chain of transactions and calculating balances from them.

the dystopian totalitarian one-word-digital-currency thing has been predicted in conspiracy circles for 30 years or even longer.

no, you can aggregate and coinjoin an (unlimited?) number of transactions into one transaction as well and hide amounts with bulletproofs, so very similar, only it wouldn't be mandatory, just optional. but if everyone used that transaction type, the bitcoin blockchain would over time resemble a mimblewimble one.

Right, Bitcoin solves this false "overcoming the nation state" vs the dystopian "one world government" dichotomy.    
    
(Even without paying attention to NWO conspiracy theories, such a one-world government would just be too *fragile*, as in the opposite of antifragile.)    
    
We just need a global internet, data structure, blockchain, bitcoin etc and we can self-organize. The global blockchain replaces the need for a one-world government.    
    
The pillars of a state are the Legislative, the Judiciary, and the Executive.   
The blockchain provides the toolset to organize the Legislative and some of the Judiciary in a bottom-up way. The Executive can and should be organized on a more local level.

No, they claim they can do without. They have papers to explain it. In short, they have a rating system for nodes. Maybe you could best compare it to proof-of-stake, or maybe you could use a different analogy and see the whole encrypted P2P cloud as the equivalent of a blockchain, as the data integrity of that cloud has to be ensured either way. (remember "Maid" is a play on RAID.)
And as all data is (besides being shredded into shards and encrypted) hashed and globally indexed, the data can and will also be de-duplicated, which allows for applications like an integrated SafeCoin or a naming system. So you can't have a copy of a coin to double-spend or of a "name" to spoof it without the system detecting it.
But I guess indeed it's not proven yet that this system is able to withstand all kinds of imaginable attacks.

you could say there's "No need" and propose alternatives and DROs and local solutions all you like, but the state *already* exists, and has a monopoly on this service; the shift towards property tax as the only taxation left would happen gradually and with consent of the majority of the public (who are *not* ancap-libertarians). To replace the state would still require a revolution (which is a typical long-standing Marxist narrative).  
  
Perhaps though, a "disruption" would be enough, judging from today's perspective and what we have learnt from Bitcoin, it's just difficult to imagine what this could look like in the case of land ownership and property (and no, blockchain technology alone is not enough for this). My estimate is that this "problem" won't be solved, the state won't go away, until we expand to new frontiers and pioneer and colonize the solar system.

yes, deadalnix is one of the reasonable big blockers.
originally, the block size debate was never about "unlimited blocks everything onchain", only lunatics like csw propose this economic and technological nonsense, and now the whole r/btc camp is on that stance. weird really.
the debate was about the \*timeframe\* of when to do a hardfork (if at all) and which size the blocks should be.

such shows are also marketed aggressively; perhaps in a tipping economy there'd be a lot more small-scale indie productions. I'd much prefer that anyway. Digital data wants to be free, deal with it. When horse carriages don't generate revenue any longer, you have to find new business models if you want to produce content professionally. That's evolution. Eventually independent artists would figure out how to collaborate to produce larger-scale content beyond the indie-charm of today if there is still demand for that.

"evenly distributed", that's the whole problem exactly right there.  
  
how would you do that without a central authority that could be seized, or would act in special interest for the establishment like today's central banks?  
  
how would you deal with the bureaucracy of collecting the identities of everyone in the world? how would you prevent cheaters from registering multiple identities? it may work for a small country like iceland (300,000 inhabitants), but not for the whole world.  
  
that's essentially the reason why Bitcoin does proof-of-work. Computing power is the only thing that can't be spoofed or faked, that's why bitcoins are distributed evenly to computing power, not identities.

The state's primary and historically initial role has always been less in monetary management but more in enabling private property and protection.  
  
As long as we have to live physically *somewhere*, protection mechanisms like police are needed, which a state will use to justify its collection of taxes.  
  
So maybe property tax will be the last and only tax remaining. The state knows where you live, obviously, and will just require you to send in the money (even if bitcoins) "voluntarily" once per month. If you fail to do so, you'll be evicted out of your house by the police in the interest of the greater "public" good.

I actually like and use Tox, but with Tox you also can't send deferred (offline) messages yet, that's a big showstopper. They'd have to implement some sort of decentralized storage for that, which is not a trivial thing.

this is just a legend, a myth, a thought experiment by Adam Smith (and even Karl Marx). Anthropologists found something different. Money did *not* evolve from barter, it was always commanded top-down. Free ancient people lived together in tribes, so they did *not* barter tit-for-tat, just like you don't do that in your own family. They formed gift economies and informal reputation systems, based on self-sufficiency. Read [Debt: The First 5000 Years]( or watch

maybe it will be measured against gold, or silver, or a basket of commodities.  
  
we live in the information age now, we can measure anything against anything in realtime. So maybe the "unit of account" feature of a money will become less and less important. (i.e. you'll be able to buy and hold any resources you like and use any of them as a money in a Ripple-like system).

Astrology is most often misunderstood. It's not that the planets influence events directly. They just follow similar cycles. [Nature by numbers](

It's called "circulation" `;)`  
  
See [Freigeld](  
  
Proponents argue how well it worked in [Wörgl]( back then.  
  
(In my opinion, the reason was more that money creation there happened on the local level, just where it was needed, instead of pouring it into Wall Street which is what happens today. And circulation/demurrage is necessary for a local currency because it reduces volatility, which a small economy is very susceptible for).

The essential difference is basically that Ripple uses a web of *trust* instead of Bitcoin's proof of work to find consensus (remember however that Bitcoin is designed to be exactly *trust*-less).  
  
Ripple is decentralized too because Ripple Labs will not be the only ones running a server/validating node. However, if you want to run a node, you have to be referred by someone who trusts you. And that someone trusts only *you* and not your thousands of sock-puppet bots.  
  
So you don't need to "waste" CPU cycles to verify transactions (which also was one of the goals of the founders, especially Jed McCaleb). However the other problem that Bitcoin mining solved still remains: How to distribute the currency tokens (XRPs here)? Let's say Ripple Labs went for a very pragmatic solution. `;)`

for security reasons the proof of work has to have certain requirements. It has to be indeterminable, adjustable in difficulty, hard to calculate, and easy to verify. folding probably does *not* meet all of these requirements.   
  
but indeed it is imaginable that one day there'll be a system that allows for compatible tasks to be "plugged in". For now though this is kind of like a solution searching for a problem. At least there's already [Primecoin]( for example, but even they use hashing alongside finding prime numbers because of the required indeterminability.

The answer: either something like Ripple (or the new Stellar), or something that runs on the blockchain, and Star-"bucks" will be implemented via colored coins.

Bitcoin is not a business or organization that can verify identities. It is a pure software protocol. The degree of anonymity is therefore first and foremost a technological circumstance.

This myth will never die apparently. It was just made up by Adam Smith (and also Karl Marx referred to it btw) in their contextual framework of thinking back then. But if you really think about it, you do not barter tit-for-tat in your family. Thus ancient people never got the idea to do such a thing in their extended tribe, in their village. Also that would have been a stupid (read: economically non-viable) thing to do. You want my cow? Just take it. I have one good with you. That's a gift economy or an informal credit economy. And if you can't ever return a favor, well then you're the eventually village idiot. That's all. This is what anthropologists actually discovered how it was.
Things changed with the emergence of rulers, warfare, and slavery. A subjugated tribe had to be controlled. That's when the hitherto *informal* credit/debt relationships were recorded, mathematically quantified and enforced by authorities. And it's only then that coinage was invented. First and foremost to support soldiers. Standing armies would quickly deplete all natural resources around them, so with coins the kings brought the populace to sell food and other stuff to the soldiers. This is how markets *actually* emerged. The image of the rulers' heads on the coins indicates very well who issued them and to whom they would flow back as taxes. Gold and silver never were the "independent" or "decentralized" currencies that today's goldbugs and market-libertarians would like to believe, they rather filled the role of a kingdoms' reserve currencies already, much like in the recent age (that ended with Nixon's abolishment of the gold standard).
Further reading: 
Something like Bitcoin in this historically correct context is even more interesting, as money hitherto was *always* a thing enforced and organized by a governmental authority (yes even gold and silver, as said). Bitcoin lacks contractual enforcement so far. We can have "smart contracts" all we like, but it's just information; if you actually want to chase and catch people like pirateat40 or TradeFortress, you need an executive force. That's an important aspect of the regulation question. That's the deal today's governments are offering: if we are supposed to chase fraud in Bitcoin, then we want and need to have control over that thing.
So it is very interesting how this deal will turn out.
We might eventually choose to do away with governments and think we can deal with fraud ourselves without a formal authority, i.e. the libertarian ideal, and as free people we might eventually see Bitcoin as a tool to organize division of labor that is suitable enough; some people however might think it is not, i.e. if Bitcoin, or anarcho-capitalism for that matter, would fail to produce a high and evenly enough spread standard of living; if it doesn't, there will be dissidents and riots against the rich, causing the wealthy class to erect governmental structures to protect themselves, i.e. history repeating as it always has. Also this would be interesting to see how it would turn out.

Please, like many US market-libertarians *and* so-called "progressives", don't fall for the false market vs state dichotomy. Historically, the state and the "market" (aka corporate leaders) have always worked together hand in hand.   
  
  
  
  
  
Just a hint: The word *Socialism* didn't originally mean state control and a welfare state. It meant workers to be in control of the means of production, i.e. horizontal organisation, self-empowerment, co-ops. In short: Anarchism. Perfectly compatible with (an unregulated) Bitcoin. No need for a centralized enforced corruptible tax system.
  
  
  
The problem is always concentration of power and authority. Positions of power attract sociopaths, and society becomes a game-theoretical nightmare. Also there's the issue of scalability. Scandinavian states seem to work better than the US because they're smaller, Sweden has a population of merely 8 million. Centralized systems are fragile, bottom-up self-organization would be [antifragile]( Self-organized worker welfare in the early 20th century worked much better than a "single-payer universal healthcare system" (which will only be lobbied and co-opted by the pharma-industrial complex) ever will.

Bitcoin is just a digital currency that is not controlled by any single organization like a corporation or government. That's why there is no single "website-wide login system".  
  
The Bitcoin system is managed by all users collectively running one of the Bitcoin apps on their PCs or mobile devices.
Bitcoins are limited in numbers (to 21 million) and usable and quite practical, that's why they are valuable.
That's why Bitcoin is no scam, it's a great tool for transferring value easily over the internet, but if you want to use it for speculative purposes, there is no guarantee that you will win out. Bitcoin may stay around like forever (like the internet itself) and become more widespread and grow in value, or it may regress, stay in a tiny niche, or fail completely. No one knows, there is no certainty in the material world. Even if you store gold, it may become worthless one day if a way is found to efficiently synthesize it.
You can earn bitcoins by offering goods and services on the internet for example. You just need to download a Bitcoin wallet for your PC or mobile device, or use an online wallet, and you're good to go. See  for more details.
There are several 3rd party websites where you can exchange your USD or other fiat currencies for bitcoins. Yes this is often difficult, but this is not the problem of Bitcoin, but rather the problem of the "old world" which makes it obvious to see how tedious it always has been to transfer money through the internet.

Indeed, money did not evolve from barter, contrary to what most economists believe. That is just a myth, a thought model by Adam Smith.  
  
Originally, people lived together in tribes, without money, in trust relationships. You want my cow? Just take it. I have one good with you. It's only with the emergence of rulers and warfare that subjugated tribes had to be controlled, and debt/credit had to be quantified. That's when money was invented. This is also the origin of religion. Debt and sin is the same word in many languages. We were expelled out of the proverbial Garden of Eden through the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil, aka credit and debt, i.e. balances, accounting.

Ripple makes sense as something like SEPA 2.0 or SWIFT 2.0, something like that being long overdue as well.

maybe Bitcoin was a stealth Google project after all.

the problem at hand is not the tragedy of the commons (which is quite a myth, or falsely understood anyway, and has historically been a way to justify "private" or governmental rule over a hard to control stubborn "free" peasantry).
no, this is just a simple example of monopolization in a "free market" where this is supposed to never happen. But it does, even without "evil government" interfering. The devil just always shits on the biggest pile, as we say here Germany.

yeah but SpiderOak isn't open source. So there is no guarantee they keep their promise of end-to-end encryption in every case, and you can't set up a server. For the time being I recommend SeaFile instead (1 GB free at seacloud.cc, but you can also set up your own server), or, for a much better P2P model, until BitTorrent Sync is open source, there is Tahoe-LAFS (which is still a bit geeky to set up and use though).

Bitcoin solves the double spending problem too with distributed consensus, the *real* differentiation is *who* or *what* has a vote.  
  
In Bitcoin it's one-cpu-one-vote, because there's no way to computationally verify identities. Ripple *does* one-person-one-vote because it's essentially a web of trust. To run a validator, you'll have to be referred by an already existing validator. Bitcoin is designed to work without any trust. *This* is the essential difference.

Technically, Ripple *not* trustless, it *is* a web-of-trust. Not only the IOU-rippling, but also the back-end is based on a web-of-trust. You can't set up a `rippled` (server) instance without being referred by someone. That's how Ripple can have a more real-world-identity-based voting system about the validity of transactions that they call "Consensus", instead of Bitcoin's raw CPU-based proof-of-work voting. This just doesn't solve the initial distribution problem of the built-in XRP hard currency, hence they have the organization distribute it (pre-"mine" is misleading, there is no mining). Yes it's not so nice if you're used to Bitcoin already, but probably many people would have found not that bad if Ripple (in its current incarnation) would have existed before Bitcoin (actually Ripple is a concept from 2004, but the first implementations were based on a single server, they never had found a way to actually and technically decentralize it).
@_date: 2015-01-22 14:52:58
If Bitcoin will actually be *used* as the preferred method of payment (e-commerce, internationally, etc), then people, even when they're not interesting in hodling and speculation, will start to keep bitcoins in reserve just like they collect XBox points or whatever, and will want to see more and more options to spend then, so von Mises' regression theorem might finally come into play after all even in this intangible digital information age.

OP premise is not true, he mentions Bitcoin positively in the interview with Ripple Labs, but believes it will (have to be) regulated (whatever that means).  
  
Other than that (and besides his poor reputation in Germany), he's old establishment, though quite pro-business, i.e. a neocon. As such he likes innovation, but under strong control. Ripple (or a strongly regulated Bitcoin) will not offer much room for privacy in a digital world.

Ideally, Bitcoin mining will return to the end users again. Miner modules will be used as electrical heating components in household appliances (waterbeds, stoves, etc). Then mining will be done not for profit, but just to get some crypto coins back for your energy bill.
Mining farms won't be able to remain profitable and go out of business. This is also good for re-decentralization of course.
Then Bitcoin mining *may* expend the energy equivalent of a whole nation, but it will be energy that would be consumed already anyway.

It's not exactly wrong, but what we need is regulations 2.0  
  
i.e., community- and technology-driven, not government-enforced regulations.  
  
Best example: The rules coded into the Bitcoin technology. Or, exchanges that implement public auditibility. I mean, people still can use obscure Bulgarian-Russian exchanges if they like, but they now have the choice to use those that provably have sound backing.  
  
Conclusion: Disruptive "unregulatable" technologies like Bitcoin may indeed invite malicious actors that commit fraud and theft at a massive scale, but this forces society to invent new ways to handle this problem. Nassim Taleb has a word for it: antifragile. Or simply, evolution.

mass production would lower prices, it could become much an element just like common available resistors producing heat. plus you wouldn't even need the latest generation all the time. to get a few more satoshis back for your energy bill would be "just nice", nothing more. also i'm imagining all kind of household appliances, not (just) central heating.

yes. but chips become very cheap when mass-produced. see the various nano computers available for a few US$. the element wouldn't cost a few cents like the resistor but maybe could be as low as 5$. doesn't have to be the latest generation either, as said. so not much different to all the other IoT crap that will be built into such devices in the foreseeable future.

block size debate. you have to maintain a full node in order to be able to see both sides and form an opinion.
bcashers want big blocks (some even want "unlimited", which is technological and economic nonsense), thus to be handled everything on-chain. this will make running full nodes harder, even impossible for most users, thus centralizing bitcoin and giving all control to miners. this would increase transaction throughput only so much, still far below the scale of visa.
with lightning, there are in principle no limits anymore to the number of payments the bitcoin network will be able to handle.
the enthusiasm about lightning the last 1-2 years was also fueled by many researchers and engineers re-discovering bitcoin or taking it more seriously now, as they had regarded it as not scalable before.
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:19:50
would merely replace electric heating already in place today, so no more ecological impact than today already.    
    
when rolled out on mass scale, mining would merely give you some crypto-coins back for your energy bill. hoarding the chips and trying for-profit mining like today wouldn't be worthwhile.

of course bitcoin is \*all about\* peer to peer technology; it's meant to work without any server; it works without having to connect to anything hosted by any company.
that said, there are many mobile wallets that are run by companies for convenience, which of course comes with downsides that compromise on the idea of bitcoin.
you have to make that choice yourself.
so without a server, having "zero bitcoins" is no reason for \*not\* syncing, because the wallet wouldn't know you have zero bitcoins without syncing. ;)
only if a wallet doesn't generate or import a seed or initial addresses out-of-the-box, it would be intuitive to \*not\* expect it to sync, but no p2p wallet does that afaik; after all, if you install a bitcoin wallet, you already have the expectation of being able to use it out-of-the-box.
that said, the "simplified payment verification" that light clients use shouldn't be that much. u/BitcoinWallet is it really 2 gigs by now?

From the service's own  blog post:




Btw, Seafile is not a company, it's the code, a free-and-open-source-software project, mainly developed in China: 
It's a great drop-in (ahem) Dropbox replacement which works wonderfully. The file-syncing engine is much better than the one of comparable projects (like owncloud), but offers no additional functionality like calendars.
This incident is about a German hoster seafile.de who offers the functionality this code provides for people who don't want or can't set up their own servers.
We should ask the Seafile developers to include crypto-currency payment support by default (or directly pull-request), so that hosters don't have to implement this by themselves.

many folks (especially pseudo-libertarian neo-cons) talk down renewable energy sources like solar because they're state-subsidized, not realizing that polluting, dangerous and non-renewable energy sources are subsidized much more, largely because the polluting industries do not have to pay for the externalities. [Walter Block on Free Market Environmentalism](
This is really what's behind today's false-dichotomy discourse between the right (climate change denial by the right, military industrial/oil complex, Koch brothers etc) and the so-called "progressive" left (Al Gore demanding more taxation to save the climate, calls for population control, etc).
The *actual* issue is never mentioned: Every child learns that those who cause the mess have to clean up afterwards. Not here. Hence, incentives for the development of cleaner energy production have historically always been missing. Privatizing of profits, socializing of losses/risks/externalities, bsuiness as usual like in the financial sector and so many other areas of society.

Bitcoin mining goes where energy is cheapest. Energy is cheapest where power plants using renewable energy in rather isolated regions (Iceland, vast mainlands of China) have production peaks that they can't efficiently sell otherwise to regular consumers as that would require transport over long distances with great efficiency loss.
So, Bitcoin mining makes use of inefficiencies that have always been existing in global energy markets. These inefficiencies may be mitigated over the long-time, but probably can't ever be removed completely.
tl;dr: Bitcoin may use as much energy as 4 major cities, but it is over-demand-produced energy that can't be used otherwise anyway.

What changed my mind was thinking about how we would design a crypto-currency if we could start on a green field with everything we know today.
A layered approach would be most sensible. I'm working on a new approach with three levels of consensus. The PoW layer is the most bottom one and has a 3 hours block time. Yes, 3 hours. Blocks only have Merkle roots, so the whole chain can forever be downloaded stored even on mobile devices easily.

I think I remember they *do* claim that's not the case because of their "mintettes", with which they seem to achieve some kind of *sharding*, thus their claim of being "scalable". Still it of course begs the question why such a convoluted setup is even necessary. David Chaum's [eCash]( from back in the 90s, with federated servers run by trusted entities (which Chaum had also conceptualized already), would be completely sufficient for their goals.

This might be a problem that wasn't really foreseen. A project like Bitcoin will need to make decisions in development. What flies? What doesn't? Many egos will necessarily be hurt in the process. So they just fork off. 
The first major split wasn't really bcash, it was ethereum. Vitalik co-founded the Bitcoin Magazine, for those who don't know. He and some people wanted more features, which however were seen too much as a security risk and as a bad scalability prospect by the majority of developers.

Adding to nullc's answer, it also solves game-theoretical (economics) issues. Nodes might have \*selfish interest\* to insist on a specific ordering, that is when they initiated an attempt to double-spend (or are otherwise complicit or beneficiaries).
If some of such attacks were happening from time, the network as a whole wouldn't actually care. From this perspective it's only important that protocol rules are followed in that only one transaction is valid (i.e. no new money is created), it's not important which one.
However, of course, if such attacks were widely successful, the network would be overrun by bad actors doing the same, nodes could \*never\* agree on an ordering because the humans running them might accuse each other of insisting on their ordering because it is to their advantage, and the network wouldn't function anymore (behavior would depend on details of this flawed implementation though, something like iota might be a good example), as there wouldn't be pure software-protocol-based way anymore to reach consensus without a judge.
This is what Satoshi meant in the whitepaper when he wrote: "The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes."
Hence the whole apparatus, miners are \*incentivized\* to behave correctly, i.e. to build blocks with a proof-of-work as strong as the whole network can "afford"; the cost for a double-spend attack can always quite accurately be quantified, it has to overpower the whole network, and the assumption is that such an attack will not be worthwhile in most imaginable scenarios.

actually it's a bit of both, a catch-22, damned if you do, damned if you don't. larger blocks might lead to more centralization as well.    
    
the problem is scalability, and it's never easy. there are always trade-offs no matter which direction you go.    
    
almost any concept sounds good on paper as long as it's small-scale (be it capitalism or communism), but once scaled up, they become the monsters that we know today.    
    
who knows how things will play out in the crypto-currency space. another possible outcome that i don't see much discussed would be that we could end up with different altcoins after all being used in different localities and (virtual) communities, but most of them would be merge-mined for better security.

Yes, this is also one of my favorite criticisms of proof-of-stake. Once scaled up, such a system would probably very much resemble today's banking cartels. However, I guess proponents would argue that it's not much different to Bitcoin's mining center cartels. This can be solved however if mining happens in end user devices again (which can happen if waste heat can be used productively).   
    
Friend-of-friend trust chains can theoretically be sufficient, six degrees of separation etc...

MaidSafe's SAFE network also can do distributed computing (as opposed to Storj, afaik), thus claiming that they can replace/integrate any internet service of today.    
    
Technologically, Storj uses a blockchain for security. MaidSafe claim that they can do without a blockchain; consensus about the state of the network and its integrity is reached by a proof-of-resource mechanism combined with a node ranking system.

It's true that the re-invention of a system uncovers the issues of the domain and shows why there are certain structures in place that were built to fix them. (That they grow like a cancer over time is another topic.)
    
The crypto-revolution is all about starting anew on a green field and finding different solutions to these issues along the way, and hopefully the solutions will be transparent, adequate-modern, technical-impartial, accessible-decentralized instead of opaque, obsolete-anachronistic, corruptible-political and exclusive-hierarchical.

But that's true. Always. People just don't get it. They don't understand what money is.   
   
Money is information. That's all it is. 1s and 0s. Who owes what to whom.   
   
The problem is always about trust. Who is in charge to administer this information.   
   
Gold, silver etc are not really money themselves. They are assets, carrying the information of their own value. That's why they are commonly liked, because they are independent to a degree.   
   
Bitcoin is both. Bitcoin the network is independent from legacy debt administration (monetary) systems. The small-b bitcoins, the asset, carry the information of their own value.

Capitalism vs Socialism is a false dichotomy.    
    
The original term Socialism does not mean what most people (especially in the US) think what it means.    
    
The original term Socialism means workers to be in control of the means of production.    
    
Political hierarchies (aka the state) are considered just as bad as hierarchies in the workplace.

let's not think so much in blocks at first, that's an implementation detail. proof-of-work at the end of the day is the method used to make it computationally expensive to spoof identities that could corrupt consensus. if we had individual actors (users) collecting entropy and could verify the uniqueness of it, then we could also approach the goal of reaching a reliable consensus about what's happening in the network.

In general?

Or you mean in the context of altcoins? Many altcoins who claim are better really aren't. They just aren't widely enough used yet to hit *their own* scalability bottlenecks. Most supposedly better features are in reality merely trade-offs. Many (like Bitshares etc) who claim they can do thousands of transactions per second are in reality more like private blockchains (which, again, are nothing new and have nothing to do with Satoshi's invention).

Banks should stop calling it blockchain whatever they're gonna try to implement. It's just a revamped version of what they have today.

Thesis - Antithesis - Synthesis.
Keynes and Hayek are both still of the industrial age, we need an appropriate money for the information age.
Money is information. That's all it is.
The conundrum of money is that it must be scarce and abundant at the same time.
Scarce in that it must be universally excepted by everyone without enforced by an authority.
Abundant in that it should only convey the information of who owes how much to whom (think time banking), i.e. not have a price itself.
Something like a dualistic approach may be the solution. Bitcoin for long-distance trading, and Ripple for trading within trusted and established (business) relationships.
Actually, as I realized below, the Bitcoin's future feature of contracts based on the Blockchain allows for a Ripple-like layer on top of it.

Also, maybe on a more serious note, my personal impression lately at "blockchain" meetups is that although most of the "blockchain" talk is bullshit, it is the first time that not only non-techies but even many even in the enterprise consulting tech space get familiar with many of the parts (public key cryptography, hash chains and merkle trees, peer-to-peer infrastructures, hashcash-proof-of-work/crypto-economics/tokenization) which Satoshi used to form the whole. To us, this "whole" is the mind-blowing thing, but for *them*, even those single concepts are mind-blowing enough to be brought by PwC consultants to the enterprise space. All those blockchain bullshit use cases help them to get a mental model and grasp these concepts.

- There soon will be ASIC chips which will be much more energy efficient.
- We're most probably already seeing the peak of total energy consumption of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin may grow more as in the number of users and transactions, but these metrics are independent from hashing difficulty. We're already seeing the edge of rentability for miners. Even if Bitcoin becomes mainstream one day, mining and verifying transactions over-all won't consume much more energy than today.
- Furthermore, mining will over time be profitable only for people with access to very cheap energy, which in most cases will be renewable energy like solar power.
- The highest entropy is heat. Creating heat just for the sake of heating is the most wasteful thing to do. Maybe there will be miners built into heaters etc (I saw some coffee warmer already).
- Other applications can be latched in as well via merged mining, i.e. without consuming additional energy. We have a globally distributed proof-of-work system available now that can store any information irrefutably, and that does not require any central authority as a single point of failure/control/corruption. Admittedly, maybe this is a solution still looking for a problem, but there is already Namecoin/[Dot-BIT]( for example.
- It is hoped that in the future, Bitcoin will more and more reduce the need for legacy banking systems and physical minting which probably are even more inefficient with resources.

when you receive bitcoins for fiat on an exchange that supports lighting, they will simply extend their channel to you, you never open one yourself, and you will do your every-day transactions through that channel also, up to a certain amount at least. The question rather becomes if and why and when would you ever need to transfer and settle on-chain. We don't know yet, too many unknown variables of future economies and use-cases.

the noobs that showed up during the december bubble were largely parts of the population who buy into all sorts of weird pyramid and hyip schemes, also into all those oneswissopticlubcoin type scams that were around back then. probably only very few of them had or have actual keys to actual bitcoins.
btw, the mass media, and also *we* especially, shouldn't use bubble peaks as reference points. they last only for a very short time frame. the top could have been 30,000 or just 10,000. mass psychology is weird. (yeah yeah technical analysis yadda yadda.)
also, thanks to small blocks, not yet *more* people lost money, because many might have been deterred by the high fees without yet understanding the tech. new technologies and growing pains. each mania hits the limits of the current infrastructure (last time it was exchange centralization with mtgox), and it will continue to be like that. maybe next time lightning and liquid will be fully active, but we will discover their limits during the run-up to $50,000, and so on.

ASIC resistance is a delusion. You will only postpone the problem. Better we get the current phase of ASIC manufacturing over with as quickly as possible, until the physical limits are reached. Then things will re-decentralize again.
An easy switch to enable a quick PoW change in the Core client (but need not be ASIC resistant) might be a good defense and game-theoretical device against mining cartels though.

Bitcoin already helps unsuspecting people that have never heard of it because it already forces those dinosaurs to innovate and dismiss all their mainframe COBOL crap; more efficient automated distributed ledgers (aka more proprietary "blockchains"), even if private among banks, will help reduce fees and bank transfer times (though probably not without having to lay off a large amount of employees).

Mining farms should and will become unprofitable either way. Not necessarily through 21.co -- but it's almost certain that eventually, mining capacity will be built into consumer electric heaters, waterbeds, etc, and people will mine not for profit, but just to get some crypto-coins back for their electricity bill. For-profit mining, be it small-scale or large-scale, will then vanish. And that's a good thing.

Think of bitcoins like a digital version of seashells, which in ancient times were often used as money.    
    
The bitcoins themselves are the actual money because they are 1) useful (as a medium of exchange in a global value transfer system that is owned by no one), and 2) because they are limited in number, like collectibles (but still sufficiently divisible with 8 places behind the decimal point).    
    
Remember also World-of-Warcraft gold and items became valuable and were traded on ebay, i.e. in the real world, for real money, but the problem with those is their supply is still controlled by a single organization (Blizzard Inc.). The supply of bitcoins is not controlled by any single organization, it is rather defined in its protocol that all bitcoin nodes that every user can run adhere to.
So, usefulness and scarcity are the requirements for any good to become valuable, no matter if in the analog or digital world. And once something is valuable, it may be traded to and fro other valuable things and moneys, hence you get the exchange value against USD, EUR etc.

Yes. An enterprise has to outperform the value increase of the standard money with their dividends. Only few enterprises will be able to do so, fewer than there *could* be which would still be profitable if there was a more neutral money. That was my point about the centralization and stagnation. (Today we of course have the opposite: due to the interest rates lower than the inflation rate, non-cost effective enterprises are being subsidized.)

Mining algorithms that require a lot of memory are hoped to be more ASIC resistant. Until now, all attempts at such algorithms were not asymmetric though, that means the verification took as much memory as the creation of the proof-of-work and of a block in the blockchain, which would over time probably become quite impractical for (mobile) clients in such a system.   
   
This paper says they have found a proof-of-work algorithm which is both memory-intensive *and* asymmetric, and which is technically based on the [Generalized Birthday Problem](   
   
I'd like to see feedback from mathematicians, cryptographers and core developers for this paper also.

I don't think that it is even desirable to require more complex algorithms for mining. If the coin is valuable enough, incentives will always be there for specialized hardware to be built.   
    
ASICs are simple enough to produce so that there isn't a monopoly of manufacturers. A complex piece of hardware will concentrate and centralize production of such hardware.   
   
Also it would be a good outcome for the "wasteful" energy requirement discussion if mining would return to the end users (instead of data centers) again, and people wouldn't mine for profit, but only to use the waste heat (think swimming pools, waterbeds etc), and just to get some crypto-coins back for their energy bill. This will be good for the over-all re-decentralization of Bitcoin. For that, the mining hardware has to remain simple, so that it won't be much more expensive than resistors to create heat, so that such appliances will be built. Today's ASICs are simple enough.

Today we have sub-inflation-rate interest rates because the state wants to subsidize enterprises that may slightly be not cost-effective. But that creates jobs and keeps people busy. A win-win situation for the enterprise and the state. Obviously, that's a flawed model too. Thus, it seems to be that a middle-ground would be ideal, a money that is as neutral as possible.

Bitcoin isn't a "P2P mesh network" though because it still needs a global singleton blockchain to prevent double-spending.
Still, cool project. I also like 
That's how every internet application should be built in general, and *the* Blockchain (i.e. Bitcoin's) should be used only sparsely and when and where a globally synced state is necessary (i.e. not like what those idiot-put-everything-on-the-(meth)-blockchain-evangelists believe).

It seems that a monetary system that favors savings instead of debt would lead to stagnation.   
    
Why would you invest in some enterprise with a lot of risk when you can just be sitting on your money?    
     
There would be investments only in very promising enterprises (i.e. very high yield), which would lead to a centralization not better than today because of the allocation of capital to only a few corporations.     
    
It seems this would also suffocate the little opportunities for social mobility that are left.    
    
That said, today's economy of consumption mania, stock market bubbles, venture-capital-sponsored self-exploitative motivational-blurb-based sect-like startup-culture isn't the answer to the endless-growth-on-a-limited-planet mantra (which especially comes from the left) and a society that is automated more and more with computers and robots.   
   
So maybe an economy based on a savings-favoring monetary system to overcome the growth-paradigm *is* the answer.    
    
The [question of who owns the machines]( the lack of social mobility, and the already existing widely prevalent inequality could be mitigated if not by taxes (which are, at the end of the day, unenforceable) then by an economic model that is more participatory, more syndicalist, see e.g. the very successful Mondragon Cooperative Corporation.

At first intuition Bitcoin and PoW really seems inefficient, because as a moderately technologically competent person would in their mind consciously or unconsciously compare it to a transaction system based on a simple database.   
   
In reality though, that's exactly what we have today already, and apparently the banking and insurance industry is quite wasteful too (even without tackling the physical money issue). They have whole skyscrapers and financial districts, which may directly and indirectly (construction workers, infrastructure etc) account for over 50% of jobs and thus for over 50% of energy consumption already this day. (And I'm not going to mention the proof-of-force military-backed petro-dollar.)   
   
This is what Bitcoin can replace. (But admittedly, probably won't. See  -- i.e. even if Bitcoin will replace most of today's banks and insurances, they will stay around and shift their fields of activity.)    
    
That said, PoW will not be very wasteful in the middle-term. The economics behind it *have* to play out in a way that mining will only be worthwhile where the waste heat can be used. So any electric heat source of today could be replaced by a mining chip. And people would not mine for profit, but just to get some crypto-coins back for their energy bill. This scenario would also solve another problem: it would re-decentralize Bitcoin again.

 was one of the first like-Amazon-Turk-but-with-Bitcoin services. I remember it was funny back then because one of the tasks was you could earn coins for looking at titties. You had to select which pictures were NSFW and which were SFW.   
   
Other tasks were more cumbersome though, like categorizing people's profiles on twitter and other social media sites, and mostly because of the large category set you weren't congruent enough with the previous choices of your fellow co-workers, which lead to you be sorted out and not being compensated.    
    
Compensation is also generally still not so high probably, as you surely have to compete with 3rd world rates.

the remaining problem though is the identity problem; how do you prevent double-votes? if you wanna go 1-person-1-vote, you'll still depend on registry office bureaucracy... but at least elections can't be forged so easily anymore when a blockchain is used.

That some Bitcoin early adopters were lucky and became wealthy is no more significant than internet domain grabbers or Apple stockhodlers from the 90ies who became wealthy.    
    
Or to put it more generally, just because Bitcoin represents a store of wealth *and* a medium of exchange at the same time, just as any currency should, does not mean that its store of wealth function has any more impact on its function as a currency than any other store of wealth.   
  
So yes, wealthy people could influence the Bitcoin price and pump and dump it a little bit (hopefully less the more Bitcoin is actually used), but it doesn't matter if these people are wealthy in Bitcoin or in Apple stocks.

Some things are true but this article is oversimplifying a lot too.     
     
It's a bit more complex. The problem is, in a globalized economy, a similar standard of living and quality of infrastructure everywhere is almost mandatory. The wealth gap would increase if 'em lazy Greeks would just "buy less stuff" as the article implies. If a country or region is poor, if people are poor, they can't afford anything from the global market, and the wealthier businesses would have no one to sell their stuff anymore, and the global economy would screech to a halt, leading to recessions etc...    
    
In Germany we have transfer payments: Munich (an example in the article) is wealthy and subsidizes Berlin. The lowest standard of living here is high, we don't know slums and trailer parks to the extent they exist in the US. So to Greece there should be the same transfer payments in theory, but in practice the larger part of the population doesn't easily agree to this. The national identity thing is still strong in today's world.    
    
Bitcoin will not solve all this either. Sure, without a manipulated interest rate, there will be more efficient investments (read: a lot fewer failing start-ups), but it won't solve poverty. So a global currency would increase the wealth gap (especially if it is mandatory like according to the IMF's plans); we'd get gated communities and slums, very rich and wealthy regions, and poor ones that can't develop, because no one would want to invest in the infrastructure of the latter. Though of course in-between there is still the possibility of cheap labor, and we'd probably get even more sweat shops and suicides. `:(`
    
I think [LETS]( schemes (which could also be based on crypto-currencies) and similar ideas and a high degree of self-sufficiency (locally growing food, earthships, aquaponics, decentralized solar power, community-managed 3D printing shops and hackerspaces etc) are the solution for poor regions if they don't want to become enslaved by global corporations, so that they can slowly grow at their own pace and build their infrastructure, so that eventually they would become competitive in the global market.

yep, not so happy either, typical whataboutery; at first.
you could argue though it's not whataboutery when the ultimate argument then is that it would be a dictatorship to "regulate" who can consume how much energy.
but that is a non-sequitur, as we live in a democracy, and the majority could very well decide against bitcoin. (though, bitcoin won't care much indeed, honey badger and all. mining would become a black market. also difficult to get all jurisdictions in the world to agree.)
it's better and more accurate to say however that miners seem to indeed follow renewable energy sources, with a few exceptions.
and it's also not whataboutery if bitcoin can actually *replace* a significant amount of banking and traditional financial infrastructure, but that's a big if.

no worries, even rather technical people and developers may take weeks and months to really grok how bitcoin works.
(also, there are different levels to actually understanding bitcoin. all the shitcoins that fiddle around with parameters and claim they are "better" are testament to that.)
bitcoin is both a currency unit and a payment network. there is no central server or company that runs it, everything is done via a p2p network, like in the old filesharing days. so it's just a program you download and run.
instead of movies and music, only one file is shared among all the nodes: the registry of transactions, aka the ledger, aka the blockchain.
and the coins (or rather, the keys required to access them) are stored in a local file on your computer, called a wallet, that you must not lose, and you must take care not to be stolen. with the software you can receive and send coins by means of so-called addresses (derived from so-called cryptographic keypairs generated at random by your computer). just show a friend one of these addresses, and they can send you bitcoins.
no permission, no registration anywhere required to use bitcoin.
since the 1980s, people wanted to invent a digital cash. just like you can give someone a 5 dollar note in the analog world without going through a bank, you should also be able to do that in the digital world also.
but when i send you something over the internet, it is always a copy. more like fax than snailmail. that's how things work in the digital world. hence, cash-like money can't work in the digital world, obviously, right? you always need banking-like services which keep accounts.
that problem seemed long unsolvable, but satoshi came along and said, ok it's not possible without some sort of registry that's keeping track of coins so that they can't be copied and sent to different people at the same time (double-spending), but let's all store and run this registry, the ledger, the blockchain *together*, all of us having our own copy of it. no bank or institution alone controls this ledger, but we all do. this kind of decentralization is the best approximation to cash in the digital world we now know.
now, if we all have our own version of the ledger, how can it be prevented that people manipulate it? a lot of things are solved by long-known cryptography from the 1970s (e.g. so-called signatures). no-one in the network can forge or falsify the information in my or anyone else's transactions for example.
but there are other problems, every node has to agree on the ordering of the transactions. a financial ledger has to be consistent, right? it has to look the same everywhere in the world. also if there are two or more transactions using the same coin (double-spend), only one transaction must be used, the others thrown away.
that's why there are some special nodes called miners. the network solves the problem of ordering by selecting at random one of these miners roughly every ten minutes, and this miner we entrust appending the new transactions in the miner's chosen order (and filter) to the ledger. (hence "block chain", one new block of transactions added roughly every 10 minutes by a selected miner.)
but how does the network select a miner every 10 minutes without a central authority appointing one?
the answer is a competition. miners have to invest computing power in a competitive race to find a special number that "seals" the recent transactions into the block that they are about to create. miners are indeed just brute-forcing (just like password crackers do) a so-called hash (a kind of checksum over the recent transaction data combined with a random value, a so-called nonce), where this hash has to satisfy certain requirements (namely starting with n zeros), and the miner who finds that hash is the one who is selected to append the new block of transactions. for their expenses, this miner is also rewarded with newly created coins, that's how new bitcoins come into existence and circulation in the first place. (hence the term "mining".)
purely by the (meta-)data that is known, ascertained and written into the blockchain over time, the network's protocol can know and adjust the *difficulty* of finding/brute-forcing this hash, so that it will always take statistically and roughly ten minutes for one miner around the world to win, no matter how many miners are taking part in the race, and no matter how powerful the hardware is that they use.
this process sounds intense and weird, but it solved some long-standing computer science problems in decentralized networks (namely byzantine fault tolerance, sybil attacks, and more).
that's the rough overview. ask where you did not understand something or where you want to know more and go more into detail.

I agree.

Still, however, switching to a new paradigm won't be easy, because people at large won't be able to switch to a more self-sufficient mode of life very quickly, and thus will defend the Matrix they depend on.

The problem today is indeed that "the rich" don't know what to do with their money and put it into real estate or stock market bubbles.
I think (hope) that Bitcoiners (we're still early adopters today) are wiser.
Once growth in any market is satisfied, it's indeed hard to still gain revenue.
So the best thing to do (and for one's children) is what governments also try by spending (but in very wrong and ineffective way): to invest in infrastructure and the common good: free and open source software, 3D printers, cheap or free education, everything that sustainably helps the poor and levels playing fields; crime due to inequality is a high external cost also for the rich.

Bitcoin has basically migrated from 1 to 2 over time:  
  
1. Invest time and resources to "mine" strange digital "coins" that no one knows about and that are basically worthless and you'd never know if they'd ever be.  
  
2. Invest time and resources to mine bitcoins in a highly competitive environment where it almost always proves that it would probably have been more profitable to buy them with fiat instead. Miners usually struggle to break even, have to do proper bookkeeping, and have to keep up with latest hardware.

Unlike gold coins that are more cumbersome to carry around, Bitcoins have no weight.
They're as easy to transfer as any digital derivative would be.
Also the infrastructure for such derivatives doesn't exist yet. And how should it be built? Can it compete against the network effect that the original Bitcoin already occupies?
In the beginning, every "banker" would have to issue their own derivatives. In part, they already exist, see MtGox codes.
And then? Even if using those as a primary currency, we'd have the age of [Free Banking]( repeating, which wasn't all that bad.
Allegedly the FED was introduced to counter some occasional instabilities, but arguably it was a bad idea. Hopefully people would learn from history and come up with better solutions. Open and transparent community banking co-operatives (with public ledger) come to my mind.

doesn't matter, UASF is basically a bet/gamble that the actual economic majority (i.e. users, exchanges, etc) of the network support segwit.
hash power does not always reflect the actual economic majority, as it was perhaps intended by Satoshi to mostly be a quite accurate reflection of it; this is the unfortunate situation we have right now with the mining cartels.
even if we have mining cartels, the idea of bitcoin has always been that even considering cold hard game theory, miners would follow the interest of the economic majority if they think long-term (more profits through higher fees would be only short-term thinking).
as this is not the case, i suspect there are actors involved (maybe from governments) that wish ill on bitcoin.

it doesn't really answer the question, especially compared to Bitcoin.  
  
The crucial question that's missing is: **Who *is* a server?**  
  
The Bitcoin paper says: "One IP one vote" doesn't work. Sybil attack and all. That's why Bitcoin has "One CPU (cycle) one vote", i.e. proof of work.  
  
My guess is it has to do with the compromise Ripple does with anonymity and privacy (or the lack thereof): users will mostly use only one address, and cannot create multiple ones at will (because it's inconvenient and expensive). So there'll be proper "user accounts", and therefore conclusions can probably be drawn about what "a server" actually *is* and manages. (Just my guess)

These Bitcoin banks could offer two kinds of services: To administer a wallet and keep it safe for you, offering no interest; or, you give them your bitcoins so that they can re-lend them, for which you can receive interest (or risk loss).
The validity of first service can even be transparent and verifiable any time via the blockchain. In the second case, the bitcoins are no longer yours, they now belong to the bank, or to the borrower respectively.

Demurrage makes sense for a local currency. It simply favors consuming locally over consuming from big corporations, thus strengthening the community.
On a national or even global level, demurrage is psychologically better than inflation for the workers, but I agree it macro-economically has the same effect: the flight into tangible assets, creating speculative bubbles, corruption and insider deals, as well as land grabbing, making everything more expensive that is produced on that land. Just all the same shit we have today.

That's probably because there have been lots of troubles with chargebacks, especially here in Germany, first and foremost if the money comes from a Postbank account.   
   
Postbank accounts of unsuspecting holders (who'd never have heard of Bitcoin) are often used by 3rd party scammers for fraudulent manual transactions. That's possible because Postbank does not check the handwritten signatures on manual transfers *at all*.   
   
I'm dealing with all the resulting trouble currently too.

Answer to Ren: It's not that miners really pour (if I understood right) money into the system. [The money supply of Bitcoin]( is pre-determined and follows certain rules that were initially designed and programmed in to the code. All that miners do is that they're trying to get their share by running the mining software on adequate hardware.
Because these rules are open for everyone to see, the rate in which new bitcoins are created is already priced in: the current market value of Bitcoin (the price which all participants agree on) already considers these circumstances.
@_date: 2013-04-16 23:17:27


  
Because you're in the "central bank" thinking.  
  
Bitcoin is not "deflationary", because it is not an enforced monopoly money. It is just an asset. It follows supply and demand. So you could ask even today, why should I lend someone my dollars, if I can buy bitcoins instead? Simply because bitcoins exist, you would therefore want to charge high interest even on dollar loans. Or would you? No, because, as we see, the value of Bitcoin fluctuates; it is therefore not deflationary. And even in an economy that is dominated by the Bitcoin currency, it will have to compete with other assets that may promise higher return. So the average interest rate in an economy that is not dominated by a central bank would have nothing to do with the mainly used currency. It will rather be the median of any assets out there.

Welcome sir, FP like Haskell is (should be) the future, as it allows to properly separate the logic and mathematics of a real world problem domain from today's still rather low level technical hardware foundation that often involves lots of threading, networking, database and IO code. A good Haskell module should require no changes in the next 1000 years.  
  
Thus there should also be a Bitcoin protocol reference implementation and possibly client in Haskell imho.

The Bitcoin system is arguably less wasteful than the manufacturing of physical coins and paper money, but theoretically more wasteful than what a centralized system could be. That's the price of avoiding a Single Point Of Failure then.  
  
Heat is the highest form of entropy, and heating just for the sake of heat is the greatest waste. Competition will drive miners to reuse their waste heat. Probably there will be appliances for that, building upon the idea of the [Jalapeño]( (a tea warmer). There could be central heaters and hot water systems with built-in mining.  
  
There is also [merged mining]( which allows Mining power to be used at the same time for alternate blockchains. A blockchain is basically just a globally distributed key-value-store. So this allows to have databases in the future that can incorruptibly store information in the long-term, without requiring to trust a central administrator. Admittedly this is still a bit of a solution looking for a problem, but many applications are imaginable.

No problem with the concept of money as information, I say that all the time as well, but then all information should not be concentrated within the banking system because then it obviously becomes corruptible.
The information should stay where it is created, i.e. with every individual or business. See Ripple, that's how it should work.

how did Ron looked awful in that interview? He just demands sound money. Hayek's theories aren't exactly more invalid than Keynes' or Krugman's. For me it was rather Krugman that was goofy. All he spouted was unsubstantial appeals to tradition ("It's always been like that!") and appeals to authority ("The government's been always in charge of that!").

The whole argument is ridiculous even by Krugman's low standards.  
  
It may be true that gold and silver are less than optimal currencies for an economy, as their exchange value would rise above their use value, making them more expensive for those who want to actually *use* them in electronics etc (although that's obviously also the case when they aren't official currencies like today; so what could Soviet Krugman do about it anyway).  
  
But the output of Bitcoin mining isn't such a resource; in fact it's one of the most optimal, side-effect-free stores of value imaginable.

Former central banker and Euro co-creator, and now complementary currency advocate Prof [Bernard Lietaer]( has a lot of material about the WIR.

most shares in the Bitcoin world have this return easily (ASICMINER, SatoshiDICE before they were sold, just-dice, etc)...  
  
which means that market rates of private loans would also have to approximate these rates, as loaners would have no incentive to go below these.  
  
the thing is of course that there is always the risk of bankruptcy.  
  
A proper bank (like from the free banking era) would also have to adjust their interest rates from time to time.

Why don't you read up on it a little first. It's basically a shared transaction ledger in a peer-to-peer network owned by no one, the rules (like money supply and how it's initially distributed) are ensured cryptographically and by consensus (&gt; 50%). You own your private keys which are your money, and they are not tied to any identity, you don't have to register anywhere to use bitcoin, just download the program and go.

I find Austrian economics quite logical. For me it's not an ideology to follow and idolize though; just a good framework to explain things, as it makes much more sense to me than Keynesian economics, which not only has holes in theory, but also obviously fails in practice.  
  
I have also a "socialist" side though, but in the original meaning of the term: Workers have to be in control of the means of production. That essentially means flat hierarchies, and fully transparent and "fair" businesses. This is no contradiction at all to a free market. That's why much of today's political discussion is based on false dichotomies.

If someone tells you that there is land that is "public" then they're lying. If they say that land belongs to "the people" they're telling you fairytales.
The dichotomy public cs private is largely a false one. Countries today are economically acting entities just like any other. They own their resources and have to household with them.

There would not be "fractional reserve Bitcoin banks" in a free society, but not because "'tis a FRAUD !!!2!!" but because there would not exist banks the way they exist today.  
  
There'd exist only lending markets, i.e. exchanges for stocks and bonds. If you invest in a stock, your bitcoins are gone. Period. You can only hope you will get any of your bitcoins back from that marketplace (plus dividends hopefully) later whenever you need them.  
  
Now, sure, maybe you don't want to or don't have the time to evaluate and invest in several different companies. So there'll be "brokers" who'll do that for you. And what else is such broker other than what a bank is supposed to be? And what else is that bank than just another company on that same exchange market?

It's not authoritarian or like state-supported trade unions, it's voluntary associations and self-organization of workers. And no worries if you're an individualist, you could still do your own thing back then in Spain (you'd only have run into problems had you been the kind of exploitative bossy type trying to find worker slaves).  
  


  
Democratic voting is just a tool. Also in capitalism it's shareholders who vote.  
  
The real question is always about scale. Democracy stops working when too many people are involved and becomes too big ("representative"), same as with capitalism turning into crony-ism.  
  
The model of a more co-operative style of industry is still alive and well in the Basque region today, and proves it works due to flat or non-hierarchies and highly self-motivated workers:

hmm not necessary imho. Some lose, some win. As I mentioned in C), it just may take longer till requests to cash out can be fulfilled if the current market conditions are extremely unfavorable (bearish).  
  


  
To bootstrap, the system first needs bitcoins. It's a Bitcoin exchange after all, so it naturally needs bitcoins to have a purpose and something to offer in the first place.  
  


  
Not necessary imho. So first there'll be some who put in bitcoins. They'll naturally also set the first price. (I imagine each exchange website would have its own order book and bitcoin price. The market will find players who'll do the arbitrage.) Those who want to cash out quickly will probably set the price below the average bitcoin value of already existing other exchanges, attracting the first fiat depositors, from whom they'll receive their money.

@_date: 2013-05-03 09:18:15
I wrote this up a while ago, maybe it *can* be possible.  
  
1. There is a fiat ledger database. It can be a distributed. It only contains internal bookkeeping information. Much like Ripple.  
  
2. Any exchange website can use this database. Such a website can also run in Tor.  
  
3. I'm new, I want to buy bitcoins, I register and log on to one of those exchange websites.  
  
4. It looks and works like any other exchange. First, I have to deposit some fiat.  
  
5. This website does not manage its own bank account however.  
  
6. Instead, it tells me to wire-transfer the money to some random guy's bank account.  
  
7. After a while, the random guy has confirmed he received fiat funds, and sends an appropriate confirmation to the network.  
  
8. I now have my fiat displayed in my exchange account.  
  
9. Everything looks and feels just like MtGox and other exchanges. No OTC crap. I can instantly buy and sell BTC for fiat. It's just local bookkeeping for the website after all at this point.  
  
10. I've made some gains (or not) and want to cash out some or all of my fiat.  
  
11. The network picks one or more appropriate candidates who want to deposit fiat to buy bitcoins.  
  
12. From their point of view, the random guy of point 6 is now me.  
  
13. I have to send a confirmation to the network, probably manually, that I've received my funds.  
  
14. Mission accomplished.
  
Remarks:  
  
A) The fiat ledger database contains all the necessary bookkeeping, but should keep private information like bank accounts secret.  
  
B) However, cheaters could be blacklisted and their bank account details could be published.  
  
C) Deposits and withdrawals may take quite a long while depending on current market parameters as there'd essentially be internal waiting lists that would have to be matched. Spectacular price crashes and bubble bursts can have dramatic effects in this regard.  
  
D) There probably are still some unresolved issues with this whole idea.

Generally, this Krugman argument is fallacious. Probably deliberately. In his baby-sitting example, an hour is always is an hour. It's a co-op, not a market. In a proper market, there would be price flexibility; if there is a short supply of baby-sitters, the price would go up, i.e. if I need a baby-sitter in summer, maybe I'd need to pay double the "hours" which I earned in winter.  
  
That's not to say that people couldn't simply print baby-sitting hours instead too, if they agree on this monetary policy; in fact, some (non-mainstream) economists propose that we need multiple currencies for different purposes to provide more flexibility and diversity in a monetary eco-system.

Don't forget mining solves two problems at once: Finding consensus in the ledger, and distributing the coins.  
  
Mining is a technical necessity. Basically no better solutions have been found yet to come to consensus in a distributed system. (Yes there is Proof-of-Stake, and trust-based approaches like in Ripple, but those have other problems.)  
  
Without this consensus, everyone could manipulate the transaction database and create for themselves as many bitcoins as they like, thus they would become worthless.  
  
You can't use real-life identities to find this consensus because there is no central organization that can verify them and prevent malicious attackers from spawning millions of those. Same with IP addresses basically.  
  
That's why in the Satoshi Paper the approach the Bitcoin system uses is described as "One CPU (cycle) one vote". CPU power is the only thing that cannot (on a large scale) be faked.  
  
btw there is a fork called Primecoin now, which does proof of work by finding large chains of prime numbers, so this approach might create some scientific value along the way.

There's no one here who receives money to "not return it".  
  
Those who receive money are those who want to cash out anyway.  
  
The only problem here is that there would have to be some confirmation mechanism about that fact. The receiver could complain he didn't receive any money. If he makes that believable to the network, he could theoretically receive money twice.  
  
Another problem rather is that those who put money into the system could revoke the transaction later, if their bank allows such a thing, or how some scammers did via PayPal. Here the blacklisting and publishing of their identity could be applied. The network could offer a bounty here. Such things could be funded by trading fees.

There's the hint of the typical [broken window fallacy]( again.  
  
Why do we need full employment? That's the fallacy of the Keynesian top-down control-freaks.  
  
An ideal, non-corrupt economy should make it possible to scale back when there currently is no real growth, which can only come through innovation. There should not be recessions, everyone in average would just work less, and because no production parameters have changed and there is high technological automation, people would not earn less income than before (i.e. no loss of purchasing power). If there is innovation again, such an ideal economy could flexibly and dynamically scale up again.  
  
From what I gather the Keynesians are right in so far that a currency should not be scarce, because money is only information, entries in a ledger. Economic activity should not suspend if there are people willing to work and consume just because "there is no money". But you don't achieve that goal by letting central banks print, by throwing bank notes from a helicopter (or rather, in reality, pour all the fresh printed money into Wall Street); you achieve that by decentralizing banking and the issuance of money, by enabling currency "competition" (see "right-wing" Hayek), resp. a rich eco-system of currencies and value systems (see "left-wing" Bernard Lietaer), i.e. by having people, communities and small companies to issue their own scrip and promises, to let people be their own banks (peer-to-peer credit/lending/banking, also crowdfunding).

Basically, money is just a tool to store and transport value. If a good can provide these features, be it seashells or bitcoins, then there will be demand for it, and thus it will *gain* market value, enabling it to fulfill the mentioned abilities to store and transport this value.

I'd rather not "set one up", I think more and more people realize that top-down structures are not needed and make everything worse. Anarchism does not mean market-libertarianism as some especially in the US would believe. Were there suddenly no more nation states today, and thus no more of Ben Tucker's four monopolies, with the information technology we have today I believe people would self-organize in some kind of networked/peer-to-peer economical and political system somewhat resembling a free(d) market syndicalism.

I don't want to be kept in a hamster wheel, I want to live in a debt-free home that did not take more than one man-year to build (unlike being its price being equivalent to a man-lifetime in the current system), and offer goods and services whenever I really need or want to, and not because the central bank perpetuates me to.  
  
If you fail to see the matrix, I would kindly appreciate for you to accept that there are some who choose to opt out of the current scheme and withdraw themselves from your control. Thank you.

Bitcoin paper bills can not be "fractionalized". They're still bound to a real Bitcoin address you can look up on the blockchain.

What he rather describes with "no interest" and everything just being balances is an internet LETS or [Ripple (the original idea anyway)]( But this approach has privacy problems, all your balances will be tied to your profile and necessarily be public.

Money, basically, is a social construct. It's an agreement that enables someone to redeem goods and services from society.  
  
Barter items, precious metals, crypto-currencies (mimicking PM), gov issued tokens, mutual credit/debt, etc are merely tools to achieve that end.  
  
"Medium of exchange", "Store of value", "Unit of accounting" are merely descriptions of what a manifestation or implementation of such an agreement could probably look like, given the state of knowledge, tools and technology we have today.  
  
Money in an information society of the future could be something even more abstract and intangible than crypto-currencies. You want that car, you ask SkyNet can I have it? SkyNet says yes or no. Or tells you to work two more months.

there are for sure many different interpretations of socialism, i also prefer one that doesn't require any government `;)`

If worker collective A can't get their shit done and produce much crappier shoes than collective B, well then they will eventually be out of business and have to look for something new. You'd need a world-wide planned economy to prevent that, and I'm not for such a thing, even if it's supposedly implemented "democratically".

Looks to me it is the author who has a Kindergarten understanding.  
  
Friedman's approach would *not* be chaotic as Bitcoin, obviously. Such a fiat currency wouldn't be capped at 21 million. The public would not perceive it as a high risk investment.  
  
Bitcoin's "total chaos" and volatility comes from its uncertain future: it might be worth a lot one day, but it could also drop to zero.

Although I don't agree with all of his views, [Bernard Lietaer]( work is definitely recommended reading and viewing.  
  
He basically takes Hayek's idea of competing currencies further and proposes what he calls a rich eco-system of monetary diversity. Mostly that would be in the form of companies and service providers issuing promises.  
  
Most here probably wouldn't agree with his stance that governments should issue currency.  But I guess the problem with governments is all about size and scale.  
  
The thing that doesn't make sense to me is that he proposes a global currency with demurrage he calls Terra.

Ron Paul argues for competing currencies, and I didn't say I think money has to be a material object.  
  
Money has always been a technological problem trying to solve the issue of trust. Money is simply information. The stored information of the value of my labor, allowing me to redeem (hopefully) equivalent value from society later. If there was a way to store that information reliably on my hard drive without external risk factors (volatile gold/silver/bitcoin exchange values), that'd be great.  
  
We live in the information age now. Inflation is unnecessary, it creates all sorts of unintended consequences. We don't need the monetary methods of the industrial age any more.  
  
You don't solve liquidity problems by printing and pouring new money top-down into wall street and hope it would trickle down.  
  
No, you let people print their own money to create ad-hoc-liquidity where it is needed from the bottom-up: by complementary regional currencies, or by issuing promises through a tool like Ripple.  
  
A rich eco-system of monies. This is basically an extension of Hayek's idea of competing currencies.

Here in the EU it's not much of a problem. Many people do online banking, and we can do [SEPA]( transfers which are mostly free and mostly only take a day.
So this use case of Bitcoin isn't actually that unique here and not a reason to use it. But besides privacy, I guess it's the openness of Bitcoin that will enable many future applications and scenarios that will leave traditional banks behind and in the dust.

there's no company or formal organization behind Bitcoin. It's a peer-to-peer network just like what's used in file sharing.  
You don't even have to open an account anywhere, you just need to download one of the wallet apps to use it.  
This peer-to-peer network is programmed to have certain rules, like for example, that there can be only 21 million bitcoins ever in existence. Or that newly issued bitcoins are first given as a reward to those users that run a certain program that helps to secure the network by validating all the transactions that occur.  
The limitation to 21 million bitcoins is required for them to have actual value: because as we know from economics, everything that is limited and useful (because bitcoins can be transferred globally very easily) has value. And because they have value, they are traded on a lot of 3rd party exchanges, and bitcoins will gain or lose value depending on if over-all adoption grows or shrinks.
@_date: 2013-02-01 22:08:41
well anonymity (as in "system without the need for identification or registration of any kind") is what makes bitcoin work in the first place. Instantly, globally, without any bureaucracy.

Property and especially land is a delicate topic yep. We still live in post-feudalism. Unlike what most libertarians seem to believe, property rights are not something god-given without a state. Surprisingly, I read even von Mises was arguing somewhat along the lines that land must be "in use", which also matches the position of many anarchist socialists. I think the American position of libertarianism is more market-oriented simply because they have much more land available and this was never really an issue.    
  
However, still I guess we must get out of this post-feudalism first. Historically, land was under control by church and the kings and emperors because "by Grace of God".  
  
Maybe something like this: Thesis: Individual property rights. Antithesis: No property rights. Synthesis: Implicit collective property rights (where a collective can also be the size of 1) for property that currently clearly is *in use*.

Bitcoin is for people who don't like central banks or governments issue money because they're for mathematical rather than bureaucratic control of money supply.  
  
The concept of crypto-currency was very new back then. Satoshi (or the early adopters) had no other choice than to mine the first coins themselves in order to bootstrap it. If they had not done it, or if they had publicized the concept widely first and waited, they would not only have met skepticism (bitcoins were practically worthless back then, the concept would not have been understood), but also someone else would have started mining instead. It was an experiment, a proof of concept. Turns out it was successful.  
  
Now if there is a significant envy of early adopters, some people will have to get together by their own initiative (i.e. not expect a government to do it for them) and start a competitor with the goal of more equal initial distribution. The concept of crypto-currency is more widely understood by now, so maybe they will be successful.
@_date: 2013-05-17 13:55:03
is that a joke or half-serious? it's worth a thought if a crypto-currency can be designed that doesn't keep a distributed transactions database, but instead stores the current location of ONE or any coin (or a stack of coins). The first problem to solve here would be to define what "a location" actually and securely is.

that's right, they were voluntary, as said.  
  


  
the idea of "property" is indeed debatable if you want to do away with a state. There are several philosophies out there. At the end of the day, you can only keep what you can defend (see individualist anarchist [Max Stirner]( for example). And it's easier to defend common property if you're a group (this can especially be seen that way as in this era in Spain there was also civil war). That's why self-organization without a state probably wouldn't look so individualistic as most US Libertarians would have you believe.

I believe Max is largely responsible for the start of the current long time rally. He suddenly began to push it immensely. 90% of his tweets have been about Bitcoin for a while.
But I trust he knows what he's doing. He's fully aware of the influence he has on the value. This new venture capital he may intend to use to counterbalance potential panic sell-offs in the near future.
He may "pump" but he doesn't intend to "dump". As he ravages against the central banking system all the time, I feel he believes Bitcoin needs a strong backing in capital to be ready for the fight.

This display of false dichotomies in the OP is as baffling as ever. Only gov can save us! herp derp  
  
"No more gov" doesn't mean capitalist radicalism.  
  
Wealth comes from production, not crypto-currency. 
There are also other forms of economic organization:   
So there was no growth in the middle ages? O rly? Apparently they had enough time to build cathedrals and stuff. And maybe peasants were happier with the way things were at the end of the middle ages, they could live off the land easily:   - Then governments helped to drive them into factories, to create "growth". Well, maybe we could have skipped some dismal things in recent history, had it not been for this kind of "growth".  
  
This is the information age, no one has to starve anymore (unless gov wants them to). If crypto-currency doesn't work for people, they'll go more local or self-sufficient. 3D printing, solar energy (which follows Moore's Law), hemp seeds, oil, fiber and plastics (prohibited or heavy regulated by governments) etc. Read up on Aquaponics. The age of agriculture is over. The age of the military-industrial-oil-cartel-central-banking-monsanto-complex is over. If you study history a bit, you'll find that many institutions and hierarchies we take for granted today are rooted in the age of agriculture, because fields of crop had to be protected.

I would have confirmed what you said. There was just no infrastructure imaginable for MtGox codes or the like.  
  
However, that was until Ripple came along. If it gains mass acceptance, this will make handling IOUs a lot easier, maybe even easier for most people than to deal with Bitcoin directly. And gateways like Bitstamp (and MtGox probably soon) will theoretically be able to issue more IOUs than they actually have.

not really comparable, Hitler's "greenbacks" were issued top-down by a government (it's also what Bill Still proposes, and he's quite anti-Bitcoin), while bitcoins are effectively issued by people themselves "from the bottom-up", and they're not backed by government projects or anything like that, but rather are assets themselves.  
  
Greenbacks are nothing new either. Most kings issued currencies the same way really. Historically, the problem with them was warfare (similar to Hitler too, then). If kings lost wars, so did the value of their currencies. Not a good store of value. So, people started to look for more independent, "international" entities to be in charge of money, hence the international bankers gained power (while additionally playing out the warlords against each other too).  
  
So theoretically, a Greenback currency indeed would be much better than today's fiat currencies, but how would we keep history from repeating itself? Some call this kind of ideas reactionary.  
  
Bitcoin rather is looking into the future, it's something new. It's international and knows no borders, like the bankers of yore. But the innovation is that it's not prone to human failure and corruption, rather that all its parameter are out in the open and transparent, and not controllable by a single entity.

commented on his blog back then:  
  
Bitcoin is not a monopolistic currency. Expansion of monetary supply, if necessary, can also come from competing (crypto-) currencies which in fact already exist.
Bitcoin is not “deflationary”, because it is not an enforced monopoly money. It is just an asset. It follows supply and demand. So you could ask even today, why should I lend someone my dollars, if I can buy bitcoins instead? Because they’re so much gonna rise in value? Simply because bitcoins exist, you would therefore want to charge high interest even on dollar loans. Or would you? No, because, as we see, the value of Bitcoin fluctuates; it’s just another risky asset, just like a stock. It is therefore not deflationary. And even in an economy that is dominated by the Bitcoin currency, it will have to compete with other assets that may promise even higher return. So the average interest rate in an economy that is not dominated by a central bank would have nothing to do with the mainly used currency. It will rather be the median of any assets out there.
Also because Bitcoin is not monopolistic, everyone can set up a competing currency if they’d like to have different parameters or more “fairness”. The concept of crypto-currency was very new back then. Satoshi (or the early adopters) had no other choice than to mine the first coins themselves in order to bootstrap it. If they had not done it, or if they had publicized the concept widely first and waited, they would not only have met skepticism (bitcoins were practically worthless back then, the concept would not have been understood), but also someone else would have started mining instead, so it wouldn’t have made any difference. It was an experiment, a proof of concept. Turns out it was successful.
Now if there is a significant envy of early adopters, some people will have to get together by their own initiative (i.e. not expect a government to do it for them) and start a competitor with the goal of more equal initial distribution. The concept of crypto-currency is more widely understood by now, so maybe they will be successful.
Anyway, so why does Bitcoin (or a similar crypto-currency) act like gold? Because only by essentially simulating a commodity type of money is what can enable a form privacy adequate enough for organizations like Wikileaks.
Credit-/promises types of online currency exist as well: see  – such a form of money is very empowering, creates adhoc-liquidity on the spot where it’s needed from the bottom-up (instead of FED printing it and pouring it into wall street hoping it would trickle down). But this “soft” kind of money carries more risk (a chain of debt may collapse), and enables less privacy as it’s ultimately backed by a web of trust, and all balances of your profile would necessarily have to be public. A treasure chamber for data mining.
So both approaches to a money have advantages and disadvantages. But they can exist alongside each other in parallel very well. In fact this yin-yang relationship (also see  – and yes, Bitcoin would be “yang coherence”) may be the ultimate monetary theory.

if you use the built-in mediation of localbitcoins (where they keep 1%), you'll instantly get your bitcoins in your account once the seller releases them.  
  
even without smartphone/tablet/internet, after release the seller gets an SMS with a code he didn't know before, but which you should already see. You can check the code even if you don't have any device with you, and you'll know that the bitcoins are in your account.
you can also transact outside of localbitcoins (they explicitly allow that). If you have internet access, the transaction will appear on blockchain.info pretty instantly, but it will say it's without confirmations yet. You can then wait for 1-2 confirmations (or however you please).

If you have a central database, it's easy: you can confirm transactions instantly.  
  
Now, Ripple is not *that* centralized. It is right now, but they promise in the future everyone can set up a server that does validation. However, it apparently will be a web of trust essentially: you explicitly have to be invited by someone to be able to join. Hence, unlike in Bitcoin, there is a concept of an identity -- one identity, one vote (unlike in Bitcoin where it's one CPU (cycle) one vote). And identities can vote almost instantly, you don't have to play the proof-of-work game that way.  
  
In the Byzantine Generals metaphor, here you only become a General if another (proven trustworthy) General has nominated you. This may achieve to lock out rogue players as well.  
  
afaik it is still not proven this will be resistant enough against attackers though. Also remember that Ripple comes at the cost of privacy, users are discouraged to use more than one "account" or address, which probably also helps with their validation concept.

well he has written some books and goes more in-depth there. Also you can find longer talks of him on youtube.
Would there still have to be multiple currencies? Indeed, Bitcoin doesn't solve problems like Greece becoming poor in Euro-land because they can't export stuff anymore because they don't have their own currency anymore they can devalue.
As long as nation states exist, they *will* issue their own currency in one way or another. Just because they can.
But, Bitcoin may already counter-balance and stabilize the petro-dollar based world economy (to a tiny degree).
In a real Bitcoin world however, we can't think in nation states any longer. If a scarce (i.e. deflating) supply of currency [causes shortages and crises]( I believe [Ripple]( will act as the counterbalance as it allows for ad-hoc and peer-to-peer credit creation and clearing. So Bitcoin + Ripple is like [yin and yang](
