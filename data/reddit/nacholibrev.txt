You have some good points. I think bitcoin will not be adopted globally for customer payments, the system cannot process more than 2-3 transactions per sec which is very low. And I doubt it will ever could process more, maybe second layer network or other crypto currency.
The idea is to keep the ledger small in size in order to be more easy and cheap for people to have thw whole ledger.

Well this block has 12 transactions...

Nobody can tell you that for sure.
Bitcoin scalability is hard problem to solve. You have to keep the system decentralized, fast and secure. 
Lighting network is not the solution for everything, it is step in the right direction, but it's not cure for everything.

The only usage of Bitcoin Cash right now is to sell your bitcoins that you owned before the split and then buy BTC or directly exchange them to BTC.

Well if the miners don't make money, they will stop mining, then the difficulty will drop and then the miners will make money.

It's not better right now.

I haven't tried it, but I think this will help you -

You didn’t made any profit until you sell!

I'm thinking the same.
All bitcoin believers think that one day bitcoin will replace current money, but right now, nobody is actually using bitcoin to pay for things, 99% of the people are only trading it. If tomorrow everyone start using bitcoin, the network will fail, Bitcoin is not ready for mass adoption.
Top posts are "Buy the DIP", "The price is low so I guess I'll buy some more" etc.. But in reality if the price actually drops a lot, people will panic sell because they will lose a lot of money if they don't.

Yes, in the bitcoin world you can only spend the entire address amount.
EDIT: I'm wrong!

I've read your post 5 times and I cannot understand your point.
How is the hashrate connected with sudden increase is transactions?
How is the btc mempool size connected eith bitcoincash EDA (adjusting the difficulty with -20% if not block is mined in 6 hours)?

Well you are wrong. A couple of reasons:
1. If you chargeback the bank will ask you why - and if you do it often the bank won't accept it. They are not stupid. You can't just chargeback.
2. Don't forget that with credit card you are not anonymous, they know who you are.
3. If stores start accepting payment without confirmation I will exploit this and buy free stuff until is fixed! And a lot of people will do it too. It's not my problem.

The transaction is distributed peer to peer over the nodes in a matter of seconds, but up until this transaction in a block it can be replaced with another.

Yeah but what if after the 2mb blocks the community decides it's not enough and then make it 4mb, then the same thing _ make it 8mb... where does this stop? 100mb block? If bitcoin is globally adopted the block will need to be very big to fit all transactions and this means centralization. This is why different approach is needed like second layer technologies or something else.

In order to use the so called lighting network you first need to lock btc in the blockchain and then spend or receive.

"Policy[4]: one or more transactions currently in the mempool (original transactions) will be replaced by a new transaction (replacement transaction) that spends one or more of the same inputs if,
1. The replacement transaction pays an absolute higher fee than the original transactions.
2. The replacement transaction must pay for its own bandwidth in addition to the amount paid by the original transactions at least by the rate set by the node's minimum relay fee setting. For example, if the minimum relay fee is 1 satoshi/byte and the replacement transaction is 500 bytes total, then the replacement must pay a fee at least 500 satoshis higher than the originals.
3. No more than 100 original transactions are replaced by the replacement transaction"
If I understand this there is absolutely no problem to replace transaction. Correct me if I'm wrong.

One thing I don't understand, I'm at the pay desk, I've sent my payment and I need to wait 10 minutes or even more to confirm my transaction and leave the store?
Am I missing something?
