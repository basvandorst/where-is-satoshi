Sick to death of seeing the guy! Although he's said to be worth about $3mil, so you have to give credit where it's due.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:25:46
Ok, I'll probably set up an account then test it with a €100 Eth cash out, see how it goes.

It's all about future blockchain technology, not month to month highs and lows.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:23:59
Transfers or cashing out?

This is r/Bitcoin right?

99%? Where did you get that from?
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:15:33
Yeah? I'm a Linux user, long term (1995), don t fall into the trap of believing Unix/Linux is %100 secure and free from vulnerabities, it isn't.

Starting to get a bit worried about Coinbase now, too many complaints, lost money, without resolution. Customer support is atrocious based on the claims i've seen here on Reddit.
Looking into a more reliable exchange to trade crypto before my funds are at a non-loseable, worrysome quantity.
When I see people talking of 20-50k transfers being lost, accounts blocked, transfers not arriving etc.
I'm a buy-n-hodl, what hapens when I want to cash out?
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:40:11
Damn! Me too! Thought I was the only one. I feel for you man.

Etherium, because of the blockchain technology, and a lot of new etherium blockchain adoption. In fact I sold all my bitcoin for eth.

Just happened to me on new tablet. I guess as tablet hasn't got a SIM card, can't send SMS, and no other way to verify.

Coinbase, because i'm in Spain. That will change as soon as Robinhood arrives.

H.o.d.l = Hold on for your damn f life lol!
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:20:36
Thanks, I'll look into them. Have you successfully cashed and transferred to your bank account with Gemini?
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:28:43
I know. It seems that there are quite a few problems that Coinbase/Gdax need to sort out the moment, or a competitor is going to take all their clients, me included.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:00:20
I think the main complaints about Coinbase and GDAX are when you want to cash out to fiat, and recieve the money in your bank account.
Actual wallet to wallet crypto transfers are less problematic.

True, but some of us have made a profit, and are also aware of a possible bubble/crash, and want to take what they can if/when it happens, while also leaving some Crypto for future gambling ;-)

Loads of complaints.

I'm one of those lucky sods who bought in early and made 1000% ;-)

FUD, they're just going to ban "anonymous" crypto trading.
