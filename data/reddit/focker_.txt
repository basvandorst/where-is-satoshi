"That is exactly what I'll tell them.
Unfortunately Bitcoin just isn't ready yet for that kind of adoption; raising the blocksize doesn't change this. I agree completely with that the fundamental design of Bitcoin is better suited to being a settlement layer for systems built on top of it; all the world's transactions on one global consensus chain just doesn't make much sense."   
Funny, there's plenty of other coins ready for that kind of adoption right now.

Anyone reading that already understands the risks associated, and understands the current dilemma. They are ELI5'ing their position to experts (other devs who have proposed block changes are reading this as well, not just us, the average user.)
