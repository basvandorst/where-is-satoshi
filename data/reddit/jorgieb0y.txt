While he had indeed valid points, I could tell he was very deliberately trying to piss him off. My two cents? He overreacted.

Literally my mother this last year after she purchased her first BTC.

Unless you are selling the bitcoins to them I don't see why you should get others interested. WHEN the price of the bitcoin rams down they'll blame it on you.

Because there have been cases were exchanges disappear with people's money, exchange in well known websites and preferably get it to your wallet ASAP. Just in case.

1) Get a wallet: There are several ways to do this and there a wide range of wallets both online and offline solutions. If you're just starting out go to  and get yourself a wallet.
2) Go to a trusted trader: Again, there are a few ways to purchase bitcoins, I suggest you register yourself at  it's relatively long since you have to submit proper ID but it's well worth the "hassle"
3) Purchase Bitcoins. Once you've purchased a bitcoin(s) you can send them to your wallet using an identifier, this will make sense once you get a blockchain wallet.
And you're done! Rinse and repeat.
P.S: DO NOT LOOSE YOUR BLOCKCHAIN INFO AND DON'T BUY BITCOINS FROM FISHY SOURCES.

How does this work even?

I personally think it's a matter of time. I live in Mexico and several places are now accepting Bitcoins as a valid payment method, including from miscellaneous stores to art galleries. So if this is happening down here I am 100% positive it will happen in the states eventually.
