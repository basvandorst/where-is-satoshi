Higher BTC prices has led to mining frenzy. Miners compete for rewards. A lot of power is wasted. Making planet even less - "green".
Lower price leads to unprofitability of mining - well unless some few thousand miner give it up and stop consuming power.
Then  mining is profitable again. Much less power is spent, and the blockchain technology is still up and running.
BTC self regulation mechanism in action. Ask me - that's SAVAGE … and fascinating.
Do not blame BTC technology for price swings. Blame GREED - through organic greed + mining greed combined.
I can almost write equation for it lol.
BTC is the greed proof better the ANY other financial mechanism.
got to admire it.
4.2k for BTC. next support at 3.8k.

It seems People are taking credit to get into the crypto at this point. 
heard several cases already. and still, this is just to support btc at 4.5k.
When shy income is exhausted btc will dip again. 
is it 3.5k? higher?
If it dips down to 2.5k I am selling my car for btc :D

On the side note - it is more likely that he is wrong this time then correct again :)

Any idea on why is the BTC so  much cheaper on bittrex???
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:57:16
then rebounding ... slowly
@_date: 2018-11-30 16:43:49
Is this a 4k "support" level, or mere a bull trap and we are going down again?
Any ideas?
I am afraid of the latter.
@_date: 2018-11-22 12:36:31
There is a good deal on matt black Lambo on Amazon - goes for 8.99$. 
Cheaper than 1BTC - if you act fast enough :D
@_date: 2018-11-22 12:15:12
If btc does not rebound up to 5k at shy inflow during the next 2 days, we will see lower floor soon enough.
Question is - is it 3.8k, 3.5k ... or panic selling drowns us down to 2.5k.
PS. I do now believe in expertise in btc markets :) unless you can manipulate ...
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:08:21
Nice disinfection going on in the cryptomarket.
Parasites will die.
Waiting for 2.5k for BTC as entry point.
Will not complain if it falls farther after I will buy it - profit is inevitable :D
@_date: 2018-12-03 21:18:54
I have to admit. 
I love seeing bitcoin dropping.  and I love seeing it flying to the moon :)
That is some kind of schizophrenia.
I would love to see BTC all the way down to 1k … or even 800 usd. Then I will have a second chance to invest in BTC - again.
On the other hand - flying BTC just supports basic belief that blockchain is discovered and WILL stay with the mankind. for good :)
@_date: 2018-12-20 23:25:46
BTC Should fly up to 5 - 5.3k in next few days.
If some whale does not decide to do some bsht ...
@_date: 2018-12-20 17:14:22
This does not seem to be a usual pump.
Told you once. Got plenty of downvotes. lol
Telling you again.
Thank me in few weeks. at around 6k
@_date: 2018-12-09 22:19:49
Party over.
Going back to job from Monday. Bears being Bears lol

Most of your videos have less then 1K views. 
To generate some income you need to increase your views 100 times.
It is clear your persistent redditing is not helping. 
Adapt. search for new methods.
LEAVE US ALONE lol
@_date: 2018-12-17 13:25:00
This is happening so fast … with no warning ...
Always keep your seat belts fastened lol

I think blockchain is new mathematics. New field in discrete math.
Every development in math has led to something new and exciting.
And this gives me understanding that the world will never be the same, before we knew blockchain.

Decrease in hashpower leads to more bitcoins sold by miners to cover their expences;
Constant demand to sell bitcoin with everybody waiting to buy for next major bull run leads to even faster drop in price;
Price drop leads to farther decrease of the hashpower.
This is downsipar, that can only be reversed by some major change in sentiment. Some major news. We are already low ENOUGH to start a major bullrun.
@_date: 2018-12-06 15:34:21
Houston, we have a problem - again ...
fukkk 
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:08:53
Depends How many of the nothing (bitcoins) is on the table.
If there is ONE, I will grab the latter ;)
@_date: 2018-12-20 11:14:35
Yes - 10 days is a century in crypto ;)
@_date: 2018-12-17 22:31:34
This can not be a pump. This should be a trend.
Or so I hope :)
@_date: 2018-12-20 09:39:43
We can now officially declare return of the BULL market.
Congratulations to those who survived the siberian bears.
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:18:25
Fukkk it - again.
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:19:54
Or maybe "I wish I have sold Bitcoin for $4000" ...
@_date: 2018-12-10 15:07:03
rather - next 2 days.
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:08:16
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:31:00
It most certainly will go back.
Question is - how many of us will survive the blood bath to see the future lol
