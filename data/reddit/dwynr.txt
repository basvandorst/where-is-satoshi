I'm pretty sure most exchanges don't show market cap of each coin they are listing.
And by the way, you shouldn't really look at market cap, you should always take a look at a coins liquidity, as liquidity is more important. You can also see that metric on MarketCap.cc :)

And I forgot to mention, I also published a handy App on the Play store with the data provided by [MarketCap.cc]( (also includes a Portfolio tracker). It's currently only available for Android, but I plan to publish it on the iOS store aswell. You can find it here:  [

You can also check their combined Liquidity. Liquidity compared to volume shows how much of an exchanges volume is actually real. You can use  for that.

I actually wrote a medium article about it: 
The algorithm behind the filtering mechanism is proprietary for now, but I might release it on GitHub in the future (written in Node.js).

Well its neither a hardfork nor a softfork, but nodes/miners that don't follow the consensus will drop off the network (or longer PoW chain).

Not sure what exactly you mean..? Can you explain again
