I'm not complaining at all.
@_date: 2015-12-26 05:13:11
Well it did just do a $12 drop.
@_date: 2015-12-31 03:47:04
I had no idea they were a local Philly company.
@_date: 2015-12-24 04:58:30
Well they predicted 455 and they are close I've seen up to 459 I believe.

Half-Life 3 confirmed.

I think the expression is "History repeats"
@_date: 2015-12-12 17:32:38
I can only hope
@_date: 2015-12-14 02:20:11
I'm like you. I first heard about it on 4chan when it was not worth much of anything, maybe $3 a piece. When I later saw it was over $1100 ea I felt sick to my stomach for thinking "Nah, it's just a short lived fad".
@_date: 2015-12-24 03:51:55
I'm surprised its gained about 20 today.

I never knew why I liked him, but now I know why.

Android pay is the same technology as Apple Pay, and was on the market first. Really anyone can get a Visa/Mastercard "bitcoin card" and put that in it and just always use that card.
It would be a start.
@_date: 2015-12-17 18:23:12
If we could predict that then we would be able to predict the market.
@_date: 2015-12-19 02:30:30
I bought a coin on Friday and it was on my acct on  Thursday. Same with a 2nd I bought Saturday it was there Friday. So about 6 days.
@_date: 2015-12-21 00:05:12
These have been around for a while. Welcome to 2013. They have nothing to do with BitCoin, they are basically like a gift card.
@_date: 2015-12-20 18:31:05
If I did that I'd probably go nuts.
@_date: 2015-12-17 15:49:13
I guess I was speaking more hypothetical. 
I know that no one will know EXACTLY why, but it seem pretty clear every time it starts to rise up to 470 it takes a sharp dive. 
I was more asking: Why people suspect this is occurring. Why would someone or ones not want to price to rise that high? Just to keep the price down to buy more?
@_date: 2015-12-16 21:33:02
I have one of those rings on order, should be getting it soon.
@_date: 2015-12-29 20:29:49
I did.
@_date: 2015-12-17 03:05:20
The best question is: why would you shop at Whole Foods with how often they are caught overcharging for things?
@_date: 2015-12-26 17:55:07
It's just started a 20+ rebound so I would say you should have brought a minutes or two ago if you were going to buy.
@_date: 2015-12-13 02:34:51
With how much time I spend online I'd love that time to also earn me coin somehow.
@_date: 2015-12-20 17:55:26
Thanks, just wanted to make sure there want some big news I had missed and wasn't accounting for.
@_date: 2015-12-14 21:42:55
No one said it did. The point was it wasn't expected to stay.
@_date: 2015-12-18 19:37:34
In theory it could I suppose.
@_date: 2015-12-13 23:43:23
Being new to this and not really being much of an investment guy, I assume this means, people in China that invest with Bitcoin will possibly buy more coin to change into US $ or to then sell later to get back more Yuan? In return driving up BT prices?
@_date: 2015-12-16 16:19:47
Yeah both dumps seem to have been around the 460-465 mark. Then it bounced back to mid 450's
@_date: 2015-12-25 17:24:33
Do they ever?
@_date: 2015-12-24 17:56:28
Supply now reads 15mil
@_date: 2015-12-29 19:52:40
I'd love it if you were correct.
@_date: 2015-12-19 02:29:42
correct, and its limited to how much you can buy at once for a while i believe too. $100 at first.
@_date: 2015-12-14 21:57:42
If it keeps climbing at this pace it will be at about 458-462 by week end.
@_date: 2015-12-17 16:04:16
Thanks for the reply.  I've had BTC for a while, but honestly never really paid much attention to actually how the trading works or people's motivations behind when to buy/sell, or what really makes it move. I've mostly been riding it since I bought some right after the drop in 2013.
@_date: 2015-12-19 00:50:38
Not here.
@_date: 2016-01-08 00:24:11
Never submitted any. All I ever did was set up a checking acct. no proof of who I am or anything. I've only been a member for a month or so.
@_date: 2016-01-05 16:33:22
That's a good question. I wonder how many are locked away in a wallet that no one even remembers exists.
@_date: 2016-01-07 21:23:25
I never gave coinbase any ID.
@_date: 2016-01-20 19:54:52
sold have seen mine when I sold one and it went up $25.
@_date: 2016-01-16 18:25:09
Picked up 1 more myself.
@_date: 2016-01-05 18:26:56
Just send me that one coin then you won't have to worry about it.
@_date: 2016-01-20 15:35:45
Seems to have peaked around 415 then got some panic sales.
@_date: 2016-01-07 04:55:36
Your welcome. Just after I sold off $600 it jumped $14 my shitty luck helps others.
@_date: 2016-01-06 21:06:48
The BTC market seems to be staying pretty close to flat recently, considering how other markets are doing, it's not a bad thing at all. With how the market in China is right now I'm a bit surprised it hasn't gone up.

@_date: 2016-01-07 20:11:44
I didn't get into it until about 428, a month or so ago, but had to pull out most (literally minute before the spike) due to a really unexpected financial need and pulled out most of it at $433. Just how the bricks fall.
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:18:56
I just bought 1.
@_date: 2016-01-16 00:50:20
@_date: 2016-01-15 01:57:54
If one guy quitting can make prices drop about $7 or more then that's not saying much for the future or current stability.
@_date: 2016-01-16 01:39:29
I plan to hold on for a while.
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:38:25
Not really sure how its a correction when it was holding 380 months ago. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 00:29:58
I'm in the same boat I bought 2 @ 420.
@_date: 2016-01-06 16:18:10
Yes, looks like prices wont be changing much from now.
