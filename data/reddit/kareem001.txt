You can’t reference the end result without considering the underlying problem.
I recently had to send $60 for someone and opted to purchase etheruem for that transfer, and im sure alot of others aren’t transacting on BTC for the same reason (huge fees)

Paypal puts a 180 day ban on your money but then allows you to get the money back. Don't be naive, its not an unnecessary risk. Its your money you put in there and your allowed to take your money back. 
On another note Its not abiding by the law by suspending an account that helped you find two major bugs. Its their own choice to do so.

In the sense that increased price inceases the profit margins of miners.  So the counterweight (difficulty) will rise to return the profit margins back to previous levels (before the hike)

But when you talk about scale, its about dominance in the market. Having 50% cryptomarket share is huge dominance

Can you recommend a good article/online resource  to read to get started on BIP32 &amp; Multisig?

As far as I can tell, GAW had a stake in ZENcloud and ZENcontroller prior to the actual major purchase of the majority stake that you all know about. It wouldn't be too odd for a GAW developer to help out ZEN, given GAW had hosting services even prior to the actual ZENcloud release.I really don't understand alot of the mainstream paranoia people have from any new cryptocurrency mining company...

I am a software developer, but I've been based on Java mainly for the last 5 years, ill take a look at electrums documentation and additional information regarding multisig. Thanks for the help

The OP took empty wallets into account, hence the &gt;0 psrt

I can't vouch for the validity of the math but id like to thank you for this, it will make things very much simpler for me!!

If you sell at $580, you made a loss of $20 per bitcoin and the risk you take here is if bitcoin does not end up as $380. That is a pure speculative play here; if the price of btc surges to $1000 then you just lost btc by a factor of .58

To simplify things, they could allow you to tag the transaction as a sale &amp; calculate profit/losses using that system. If any company wanted to be serious about creating records for its users then it is possible, it might need some creative workarounds but the end result would be the same
@_date: 2014-07-28 06:17:34
Thanks ill take a look at that!

Why would anyone sell his coins to buy more of the same coins... There is no logic whatsoever behind it

Not a miner per se, but bitmaintalks new cloud mining service; the prices seem competitive from first glance. I'll probably take a deeper look on my laptop tonigbt

You should be up voted way more for this response. You summed up everything I wanted to say but couldn't.

A month ago was not when brexit was announced, was it. He's absolutely correct in his remarks, there is (so far)  no correlation between brexit and bitcoin price

Snapchat, which is valued wayyy more than $1bn atm makes 3 million in revenue per year, and is actually running a loss. Its about the future growth potential.
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:20:53
The $1 million is on establishing the entity that owns and operates the ATM + actual purchase and setup costs. If he scales and adds more ATMs then unit cost decreases substantially

The mandatory recurring payments is the reason they re unwilling to accept bitcoin (in my opinion). If we forget the technology needed to accept it (which could be implemented fairly easily), they love the fact that they can take money from your automatically because people are less willing to cancel a contract rather than not pay

Thanks for oversimplifying things big guy, and those who bought at 1100 lost more than 2/3rds of their money

Given the circumstances, would the better alternative been to sell the BTC at 6000 USD a piece? I fail to see the alternative ‘reasonable’ action here

In any liquidation case, the trustee responsible for overseeing the distressed asset has control to manage the case as he sees fit to return maximum capital to the stakeholders. Therefore, he has absolute right to sell high. This means you’ll get your dues in USD and then some, which is good.

FYI, Current price is at 9k. Not to mention you can’t sell that much BTC without moving the market, probably means you’ll end up selling lower in the future. 
In any case, our assumptions of future price is insignificant. Only the trustees judgment matters, thats why he was appointed by court of law for this matter.

Exatly as hunterbunter said. That is a case of law which states that you get refunded in USD. It sucks, but i guess the whole hacking sucks as well. Better something than nothing. 
Oh and as far as I know (if im not mistaken on my law here, someone correct me if I am), any additional assets (btc or usd equivalent) will be reimbursed back to the same stakeholders i.e. you.

Lets not kid ourselves here. The reason is two-fold; a country would rather develop their own cryptocurrency on which they have full control over,. The second, &amp; more important reason, bitcoin is way too volatile to be adopted as a base currency anywhere in the world at the moment; Unless bitcoin can have some sort of arbitrary floor, it is difficult to keep your majority of your money in a currency that could loose 50% of its value in a few weeks time.

But who authorises transactions in the meantime. ie. For the next 9 minutes,  someone has to authorize those transactions. If im failed,  who does so. 
@_date: 2015-11-10 11:09:28
What if i am a solo miner and i luckily become the blockchain czar,  only to fail one minute after. Who signs the transactions when my miners have failed? 
@_date: 2016-07-20 05:17:57
Because that would require them to hold it in US currency, and any fall is USD relative to Euro would net a loss in value (&amp;they would be involved in price speculation, per se). 
Its also important to note that sometimes, for tax purposes for example, they cannot transfer the funds back into the US so they purchase Euro bonds
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:57:23
I Agree!
