It's funny how chaotic some price events can be. I would think my copying of the OP's guy... I sold at $1670.  Crap.

Why not a trailing stop of $20 then? Seems like a more profitable plan.

Well assuming it still has a good mercantile advantage to its use in transacting trade (low fees, fast, low risk), then it should be worth a percentage in online trade at some point.
Not sure what that % is but I would think 6% not impossible as it is a big ass market. Plus the liquidity would be higher then so it would be more stable.
Just some thoughts.

So glad I was so drunk after the melbourne cup race that I bought last night without thinking twice.

The market is the only price discovery mechanism there is for this system.

If you are trying to calculate risk, it is not clear what level of risk is acceptable.
Risk of bitcoin going to zero is not material as its always going to have use even if that use is illicit.
Whether or not it can lift standard of living is the true test.
We've seen some proof of this with it's micropayment tools. Such as homeless people subsisting on it in Las Vegas and New York by clicking weblinks etc. And it seems you can get paid micropayments for comments on a website!

Such bad timing for maintenance and no notice. Had a long position from 517 and wanted to sell at 700 but the site was down. Grr.

I'm afraid its viral videos.

Why wouldn't you? The total worldwide market cap of btc is hard to value.

Fascinating price discovery going on.
Wonder if the senate decision will affect it.

It needs more leveraged short sellers. 
It seems a little unbalanced at the moment to the buy side.
