Good to see other Italian guys there... Ciao Emma!
@_date: 2019-07-08 15:38:49
And obviously 3.5% is very volatile for gold.
@_date: 2019-07-08 15:38:20
I mean that there are a lot of Bart patterns.
@_date: 2018-09-06 10:12:36
Also this move was done to trigger a gigantic panic sell, so they enter the market at very low prices, but as for now, that panic sell isn't happening and all indicators are still quite bullish. What's your opinion about these big moves on BTC?
@_date: 2018-09-06 12:34:33
Wtf chart is that
@_date: 2018-09-15 11:24:24
This year I don't think but the next probably
@_date: 2018-09-06 12:07:08
Yes but these dumps are exaggerated...
@_date: 2018-09-13 07:50:20
Please, give us older news.
@_date: 2018-09-20 21:10:28
Obvious... We can only express our opinions, then only time will prove we are either wrong or right.
@_date: 2018-09-09 10:10:07
This is manipulation still... I hope that btc recovers but for now i think not...
@_date: 2018-09-19 06:14:01
Bitcoin mining is not as energy eating as gold mining.
@_date: 2018-09-06 08:54:16
Some whale did manipulate the price, no doubts. When the price drops vertically like this, it is obvious manipulation.
@_date: 2018-09-22 23:13:26
I don't think it'll take an entire year. From the very next months we'll see steady growth.
@_date: 2018-09-02 16:08:32
Me too ����
@_date: 2018-09-05 10:16:46
Ok then one cannot know what's happening with his investments? What a fucked up logic. But when I read your username I undestand it all.
@_date: 2018-09-02 16:32:49
I didn't say "I hope all bears to die", but "lose money". It's different: if bears lose money, it means taht btc is sky-rocketing.
@_date: 2018-09-06 12:35:02
I mean sell offs that touched 6000 support!
@_date: 2018-09-23 08:43:35
Idk, the SHA-256 is always there...
@_date: 2018-09-07 09:31:43
The weekly MACD was crossing signal in a bullish zone but you bears prevented it! 
@_date: 2018-09-06 12:24:43
This isn't profit taking. Profit taking doesn't dump vertically. This is manipulation! Why it's so hard to understand!?
@_date: 2018-09-22 23:16:03
For brute forcing those keys it would take millions if not billions of years for a powerful pc, so where's the problem?
@_date: 2018-09-05 10:03:33
Who the hell is doing this shit!? Stupid bears 
@_date: 2018-09-06 12:16:41
Hey, you need to watch again the graphs, this dump is literally vertical, not steady decline like other sell offs. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 17:38:32
How much energy do we consume to reffine oil? How much energy do we consume for climatization? How much energy do all the lights in the streets consume? Electricity is not the point.
@_date: 2018-09-07 09:58:56
I hope all those shi**y bears lose all their money! 
@_date: 2018-09-05 10:09:03
The pump just happened but in the wrong direction... Stupid bear whales...
@_date: 2018-09-06 10:22:26
I'm saying that this manipulation is done by a big institution and that should be illegal...
@_date: 2018-09-20 21:00:56
Lol, the denial phase has begun in january and ended in february... Now we are in the anger phase.
@_date: 2018-09-06 10:27:41
The problem is that BTC is still very low in volume so manipulation is way easier.
@_date: 2018-09-12 22:02:05
Android is way better but people still want overpriced apple shitphones...

I don't think, october is still to early... 
@_date: 2018-09-20 21:27:05
It got delayed but the impact on the price is minimal, fortunately. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 10:35:28
Probably yes ��
@_date: 2018-09-20 21:02:48
@_date: 2018-09-25 05:52:11
LOL. How much ignorance still in this world...
@_date: 2018-09-02 16:10:25
I hope that becauze if a short squeeze happens, btc would rally.
@_date: 2018-09-06 10:30:14
I'm not saying that has to be regulated, but these manipulators are ruining the image of BTC.
People who get to know of the excistence of Bitcoin, they will never enter the market because of this heavy manipulation!
@_date: 2018-09-20 20:49:38
My opinion is that people are fuc*ing stupid. They ignore a great project like Bakkt and concentrate on a stupid etf that doesn't have any chance of approval and is dangerous for Bitcoin. Why are people so stupid?
@_date: 2018-09-19 17:44:44
Obvious, but it's not the point! The point of cryptocurrency is other.
@_date: 2018-09-07 19:34:03
I think that Goldman Sachs opened that short of 74 million dollars, no doubt.
@_date: 2018-09-05 10:25:12
I think that just some whales sold... Because a dump so big in only 5 minutes could just be that! Whales doing their dirty work...
@_date: 2018-09-23 22:03:45
The shorters have loser mind. I hope they'll lose their money, because if it happens it means that btc is growing.
@_date: 2018-09-29 15:46:27
Well I don't think. There are millions of gpus used just for games and, you know, big servers, quantum computers... 
@_date: 2018-09-17 15:55:58
Actually not.
@_date: 2018-09-12 22:23:38
Sorry mister Clever if I offended your intelligence!
@_date: 2018-09-12 22:00:11
What? Did they actually put these prices or is this image edited?
@_date: 2018-09-14 19:33:29
Please don't call it btc cash, but btrash.
@_date: 2018-09-06 10:25:37
Exactly, they are shaking weak hands to sell as much as possible, people should not sell because they will play their game!
@_date: 2018-09-06 10:32:00
I have the same opinion, but with these whales, people who want to enter the market will never buy BTC if they look at the graph!
@_date: 2018-09-20 21:02:12
Fortunately stupid people didn't sold for this shit...
@_date: 2018-09-06 12:08:24
Oh yeah, but if one doesn't have fiat money but only crypto it isn't as easy as you think.
@_date: 2018-09-17 16:06:42
I mean that this dip isn't the biggest in btc history... ;)
@_date: 2018-09-07 09:30:31
It's your fault and for people like you if btc is dropping. Shame on you.
@_date: 2018-09-05 09:23:38
I don't think there'll be a major pump for now, but instead there will be a steady growth, just like 2015/2016. If BTC passes the descending triangle upwards to make an higher high, then the bear market will end, hopefully. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 10:33:19
I'm not new, I'm in crypto space since 2 years now, but I was only searching for any news.
@_date: 2018-09-12 17:06:42
But 10 btc are a big amount of money, why not on binance or something?
@_date: 2018-09-24 08:04:47
A steady growth is needed more than a fomo bubble.
@_date: 2018-09-14 09:59:21
And then some shitty whale dumped.
@_date: 2018-09-02 11:52:40
I've never wanted someone to lose money like in this moment.
I hope all bears lose their money.
@_date: 2018-09-25 16:47:19
Bakkt will be for deep wallet mega whale but dumb people who want to invest. Simple as that.
@_date: 2018-09-06 09:20:30
But these bots how many BTC need to be used? I don't think that with only 1 BTC they work, but surely need some whale to work.
@_date: 2018-09-06 11:57:16
Other times it didn't dip so hard and vertically.
@_date: 2018-09-23 19:06:28
The 200 day MA has been a very reliable indicator even for 2018 rallies.
@_date: 2018-09-13 08:16:35
@_date: 2018-09-13 18:34:47
Obviously... Good luck...
@_date: 2018-09-06 09:00:45
That was surely triggered by a short squeeze...
@_date: 2018-09-23 22:05:39
Hey hey, look at the chart. The MA acts as either resistance and support!
@_date: 2018-08-22 06:26:22
Don't worry, literally no one thinks this is an organic gain since it happened exactly when BitMEX went down. Also the SEC's decision of tomorrow for the ProShares ETF is surely negative.
@_date: 2018-09-05 20:44:52
It was some whale selling lots of btc, not profit taking!
@_date: 2018-08-22 07:04:59
@_date: 2018-08-25 11:37:40
It is always good to see some optimism in this crypto space. Thank you :)
@_date: 2018-08-28 09:13:38
On Coingecko the same. Probably some exchanges had this price spike. Now Coingecko has corrected the graph.
@_date: 2018-08-25 11:37:11
It wasn't chinese new year, but whales taking profit ;)
@_date: 2018-08-24 16:36:55
The problem is you, not btc.
@_date: 2018-08-20 15:15:41
Oh no, I forgot! ��
@_date: 2018-08-24 15:11:23
Where are bull whales when we need them? If prices reach up to 7000$ then the short squeeze will start!

@_date: 2018-08-24 17:02:03

@_date: 2018-08-20 07:14:32
Well, if the golden cross happens and, nearly at the same time, the ETF will be approved, then 50.000 is a very conservative price.
@_date: 2018-08-25 11:29:48
For a scam to exist needs some scammer who gains profit, but btc creators don't have any profit.
Please admins ban this guy. He doesn't deserve to stay in here.

Exactly, laws of our Universe don't allow the past to be modified.
@_date: 2019-03-04 22:15:17
This article uses dumb arguments. An infinite supply is the definition of an inflationary currency.
Mankind used precious metals like gold or silver to pay for goods and services for centuries and had no meaningful economic crisis.
The economic crisis started happening with the introduction on infinite supply money that has no real value.
Also in a remote future where Bitcoin will cost 1M$ per coin, you would use "satoshi" to give value to things, and not BTC anymore.
@_date: 2018-10-23 13:24:39

@_date: 2018-10-19 20:26:44
@_date: 2018-10-16 07:11:37
Well, I'll explain better.
Bitcoin as of now in 2018 jumped on the 6000 support 6 times and you know, the more times it insists on a price level, the more that level is valid. The descending triangle is at the end of his life and a breakout to the upside is more likely. All indicators point to a breakout to the upside and in november the BAKKT platform will start. 
@_date: 2018-10-09 12:37:02
It is way better than any bank, literally.
@_date: 2018-10-23 16:18:36
@_date: 2018-10-05 20:51:25
As it was when dipped from 35$ to 3$
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:39:05
This is manipulation... Coinbase's price hasn't moved at all.
@_date: 2018-10-05 18:25:39
I would be happy if it already breaks 10k! If it breaks 10k there will be huge FOMO.
@_date: 2018-10-13 09:23:47
Absolutely not. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 08:13:12
The latest pump was probably the beginning of the bull market.
@_date: 2018-10-29 18:13:19
Not fake news, but shit news. Downvoted.

@_date: 2018-10-27 17:10:18
Lol true
@_date: 2018-10-07 18:24:49
During low volatility periods like this, a lot of potential energy accumulates in the market wich will either break to the upside or downside. 
All indicators show that a break to the upside is more likely than a break to the downside, take note.
@_date: 2018-10-07 18:21:13
Blockchain is more anarchic than anything on earth.
@_date: 2018-10-20 18:40:57
But yet I convinced him in august 2017, at about 2/3k dollars... So we made profit, but not as we could have made from 2015... :/
@_date: 2018-10-05 21:41:04
BTC will reach 100k for adoption rather than investors. ;)
@_date: 2018-10-19 19:51:51
I've always asked my self, but don't know the answer... I hope it's not so horrible.
@_date: 2018-10-27 18:33:15

It is the spread, get used to it.

This is not a prediction, this is what you wish will happen.
@_date: 2019-08-24 09:38:28
Yeah, sorry I confused them.
@_date: 2019-08-23 15:40:36
BTC.com is an hilarious and obvious scam.
@_date: 2019-02-26 06:55:57
It is quite likely, because it follows the logarithimc pattern that Bitcoin is forming since 2010. The ATH recovery will likely happen before the end of 2021. I'll be releasing a more detailed chart.
@_date: 2019-02-11 09:17:21
Yeah, whenever I see some lines I analyze them �� I'm crazy, I know.
@_date: 2019-02-14 16:52:26
No problem! I did a backtest of this indicator and works like charm! This is better for trading algorithms. :)
@_date: 2019-02-18 10:06:48
You clearly have no clue on how market cycles work. BTC eill recover surely. It crashed because of the speculation, fundamentals are good, I don't see why it can't return to 20k.
@_date: 2019-02-14 13:30:49

Very funny.
@_date: 2019-02-11 09:31:14
He is just a dumbass, not Satoshi.
@_date: 2019-06-29 05:09:23
It is really unlikely...
@_date: 2019-02-14 16:50:08
Well, my indicator analyzes the momentum of a certain price trend by using exponential moving averages and weigths everything with the volumes so the results will be more clear about the current market situation. It is working also in the daily charts if one wants to trade.
@_date: 2019-02-15 20:04:13
I'm talking about long term. If you buy buy now or a 30 % drop doesn't make any difference if by 5 years BTC  goes to 100k.
@_date: 2019-02-18 10:08:14
Seeing your username I understand it all. You believe that a centralized shit-coin can surpass BTC, the most decentralized coin ever. You clearly don't even know what Bitcoin is really.
@_date: 2019-06-29 04:43:11
Io goes steadily up 300% in 6 months "but it could be a retracement of the bear market that will drop to 1000$1!1!1"
@_date: 2019-02-14 16:44:54
I don't feel likely to show anyone the source code. Sorry.
@_date: 2019-02-15 07:59:38
What's the real difference between waiting for a lower bottom that might as well never happen and buying now for the long term? It doesn't make sense waiting for a 1000$ drop to buy: if that drop doesn't happen you lose the train.
Go long now.
@_date: 2019-02-10 16:25:23
There is a spread.
@_date: 2019-02-13 21:30:54
In my opinion there is a 60 to 70% chance that we have bottomed. If it isn't the case, then the bottom will be reached very soon and for a very short amount of time around 2.5k.
@_date: 2019-02-15 08:03:59
Soon I will share the indicator. Stay tuned!
@_date: 2019-02-18 22:34:24
Extreme bullshit.
@_date: 2019-02-05 17:36:46
Tradeogre... Very shady exchange, I just use it to buy SMALL amounts of coins. Never deposit large amounts on little known exchanges.
@_date: 2019-04-15 05:50:41
It is a pattern studied by Dow in his theory of the markets. It is a common bottoming pattern.
@_date: 2019-04-15 05:56:04
Well, practically no chance whatsoever.
@_date: 2019-04-15 05:49:19
Well, just learn to write correctly in English, then we can talk.
@_date: 2019-04-15 05:54:21
They stopped BTC futures. I don't know the reason, but it didn't have any influence on the market.
@_date: 2019-04-15 13:42:40
Mmh. I noticed that, but I don't know for sure.
Yeah since the futures have been delivered BTC dumped hard.
@_date: 2019-04-23 10:56:42
Dollar cost average. Buy a little every day/week until you have a full Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-15 05:53:20
This is not an Elliot wave. The Elliot wave theory is too subjective and for that reason it is not very reliable. 
There will be very likely a short term move down, but by no means I see 3k in the near future. It's more likely that we bottomed out at this point.
@_date: 2018-11-16 19:56:49
Still better than any bank interest rate for sure... ��

Even institutions will buy there...
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:37:30
There is no real reason for history to repeat itself, but it is still happening.
@_date: 2018-11-06 20:46:24
And I said it was a "good" thing not for the crazy fees we paid (once I paid over 30$) and the transaction stuck for days but the development of Bitcoin. With that bubble developers now have very useful data to develop on.
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:42:29
0.5 dollars for moving 490 million... Unbelievable!
@_date: 2018-11-17 10:23:40
"The mother of all toxic pollution"... So Oil is very eco friendly. What a fucking idiot.
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:27:33
History is repeating itself. It's happening the same exact things happened during the 2013/2015 bear market.
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:30:55
As I already said, history is repeating itself. If we compare 2013/2015 bear market, you'll see that for it to drop as much as it dropped in 2015 it'll be at 3k. Somewhere near that.
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:26:02
This is the capitulation phase...
@_date: 2018-11-17 10:15:46
Well those BTCs are not property of the exchanges, but of people that use these exchanges.
@_date: 2018-11-17 22:02:00
Oh, I didn't notice that in one Ledger there is no BTC, so no inputs, no fees. :)
@_date: 2018-11-06 10:41:30
The 2017 congestion was actually a good thing. In fact, the developers got the opportunity to update the network and develop things like LN and Segwit. The next bubble will not congestionate bitcoin like the past one! ;)
@_date: 2018-11-17 16:26:02
It happened during the infamous 2011 Mt.Gox hack. It lost 99% of the value to 0.01 dollars but then jumped back up in minutes. So if it goes to 0 it will almost immediately return to 5k, because the fundamentals don't change at all. It would stay at 0 only if blockchain will fail.
@_date: 2019-01-10 19:26:35
Yeah, probably this is the 10-15 january dip. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 18:46:50
Ok. Scam.
@_date: 2019-01-05 11:45:41
@_date: 2019-01-26 10:04:44
Looking at your username I clearly get what type of troll you are.

If FIAT money inflates, the 1 dollar per satoshi could be a possibility.
@_date: 2019-01-19 14:31:17
@_date: 2019-01-10 23:12:44
But still it doesn't make BTC a ponzi.
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:34:18
Simply, for bitcoin, the last hard drop before the real end of bear market. This looks exactly as the capitulation of 2015. Look at the charts. ;) Probably we're heading to 3k / 3.5k...
@_date: 2019-01-10 12:43:06
@_date: 2018-11-17 10:50:04
From that point of view yes.
@_date: 2019-01-01 01:07:28
For hodlers like me wouldn't be very good a longer bear market ��
@_date: 2019-01-10 22:09:57
@_date: 2019-01-17 18:27:58
We prefer buying high and sell low.

OMG we have Nostradamus!

We will never see a decentralized internet at least for 50 years...
@_date: 2018-11-24 09:17:26
Lightning network is instantaneous, it doesn't take 10 min.
@_date: 2019-01-10 23:23:22
I expect that IF we didn't already hit the bottom, it could be between 3k and 2.5k based on the beginning of the bubble.
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:47:52
I want to cry.
@_date: 2019-01-26 07:39:03
You surely don't have much clue on the markets. Why would endure for another year? It's impossible! BTC is not like any other market.
@_date: 2019-01-07 08:30:37
I don't think that we'll see ath again in 2019. Maybe 2020.
@_date: 2019-01-08 06:55:40
They actually said bull-shit ��
@_date: 2018-11-19 13:17:12
It could be psicological supports...
@_date: 2019-01-17 22:53:45
Never use onion exchanges, they all are scams!
@_date: 2019-01-26 07:35:07
@_date: 2019-01-10 12:39:19
So also stock markets are just ponzi schemes.
@_date: 2019-01-03 20:36:45
Don't ask why, just enjoy.
@_date: 2019-01-03 11:49:24
It can't be attacked because there are thousands of nodes around the world, and also the miners that make the network more stable and secure.
@_date: 2018-11-03 17:58:51
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:45:59
Wtf? I mean, come on. Just look at the charts and tell me the differences between 2013/15 and 2018! Just look!
@_date: 2019-01-10 23:11:44
Yes, there is high probability of bankruptcy...
@_date: 2019-01-02 06:58:49
Just idiots...

The chinese people can predict the future, oooooohhhhhh
@_date: 2019-01-12 22:13:40
It is true, but also the fact that it has been created by unknown person and for its characteristic volatility.
@_date: 2019-01-10 23:07:11
Doing an average, the bottom should be now 2750 USD, not so far. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:26:25
You'll see next days/weeks... 
@_date: 2019-01-26 18:34:09
Useless shitpost

What? A crypto wallet that didn't support BTC!?
@_date: 2019-01-01 11:46:13
Absolutely no coin will flippen Bitcoin. Bitcoin is Bitcoin, the others are just secondary shitcoins.
@_date: 2019-01-07 11:41:02
I hope he shorted at 3.1k so he gets rekt.
@_date: 2019-01-26 18:38:20
This is not a correlation! People don't shutdown rigs because stocks are going down.
@_date: 2019-01-01 01:05:40
No problem! ;)
@_date: 2019-01-03 11:21:22
Had a flash crash in just 2/3 minutes of abour 3.5%. and they accuse Bitcoin for being volatile...
@_date: 2019-01-06 22:44:36
Yeah, that's a bull flag!
@_date: 2019-01-10 19:19:57
Obviously 2018 doesn't count because it was the very end of bull market. But now in 2019 we are fully in a bear market and likely at its end.
@_date: 2019-01-09 15:52:51
@_date: 2019-01-22 19:44:30
With Bitcoin you have the exact same fee for every transaction, even if you transfer them to Antarctica. 
@_date: 2019-01-10 19:15:42
Yeah, that's actually true. Every single bubble follows the same pattern. If just I knew it before...
@_date: 2019-01-22 14:51:14
Blockchain is simpler than current banking system.
@_date: 2019-01-26 19:13:51
Well for mining companies could be somewath correlated, but I don't think that much.
@_date: 2019-01-22 21:02:56
Mimble wimble should be a blockchain related update rather than a 2nd layer solution.

People very often forget about their things, remember that dude.
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:36:11
This is probably the capitulation phase, the final drop before the beginning of the bull market... I think (or at least I hope)...
@_date: 2019-01-26 07:40:28
Immediately remove your assets from online exchanges and store them nicely on cold storage! You don't want to lose them in a "hacker" attack!
@_date: 2019-01-09 18:10:46
Bitcoin.com is a scam, avoid it. Just go on Coinbase.
@_date: 2018-11-26 13:17:58
It is an international sub, so speack english, please.
@_date: 2018-11-17 16:24:13
They jumped from buildings for just 30-40% losses, BTC experienced a crash from 20k to 5k and no body noticed... ��
@_date: 2019-01-08 20:37:54
That could be the ask/bid spread that on FIAT pairings is really high on all exchanges.
@_date: 2019-04-02 12:35:57
Agree. Right now it is trading around 4.7k
@_date: 2019-01-10 19:04:38
IDK what you mean.
@_date: 2019-01-24 08:49:25
If my girlfriend was a BCH fan I would leave her. ��
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:39:33
Nope. From 2013 to 2015 there was a drop of ~84%, so from 20k - 84% the result is 3200. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:47:15
No one believed that BTC could break a so important level, but it still did it.
@_date: 2018-11-19 13:13:22
There are still 4500 and 3000
@_date: 2019-05-05 18:15:02
Doeing technical analysis on a technical indicator is just silly.
@_date: 2018-12-15 07:38:49
Between anger and depression.

Obviously if btc falls less people buy GPUs so NVIDIA stock also falls.
@_date: 2019-05-08 18:34:12
This is because governments, to finance war, can print more money. With Bitcoin this is not possible/convenient.
@_date: 2018-12-27 15:07:02
When mass media talk like that about any market, that's the right time to go long. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 08:00:40
Let's hope for the best ⬆️⬆️
@_date: 2018-12-30 14:22:46
I'm in it for the money and for the fundamentals at the same time.
@_date: 2018-12-29 08:43:28
I got the initial investment near the peak of the bubble. Yes I believe in it, but believing doesn't mean not taking profits.
@_date: 2018-12-28 17:40:29
Very cost effective pricing. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 09:34:08
Well, the image above contradicts you.
@_date: 2019-05-28 05:15:53
Personally I use Wirex, and is one of the best. They even give cryptoback.
@_date: 2018-12-29 10:45:39
I was talking of the last two weeks
@_date: 2018-12-12 19:45:09
@_date: 2018-12-29 17:01:39
@_date: 2018-12-27 18:18:38
This is what I'm talking about. This thing is so called "bear euphoria".
@_date: 2018-12-29 08:15:18
Bears reached "euphoria phase" on 15/16 december, just like bulls in 2017. Now the bears are probably in the denial phase, where they will be rekt hard. Just wait.
@_date: 2018-12-13 19:38:00
If you don'know anything on blockchain why would you become a developer?
@_date: 2019-05-14 05:44:12
It is the exact opposite: people who breakeven will not sell.
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:14:59
This is very bad irony. :)

You cannot go against a running train. Just wait it to stop.
@_date: 2018-12-12 19:45:49
Who is this?
@_date: 2018-12-12 19:45:31
Obviously by taking care of previous supports/resistances. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 11:21:33
This is fkin true
@_date: 2018-12-18 11:24:09
I'm just saying that id you'd put $1M in Gold on ATH you would have lost $350k. Just saying. It isn't a real store of value, just a bubble that will blow like Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:14:10
In the future bears, who now are overly entusiastic, will get rekt. Not now, but in future.
@_date: 2018-12-29 08:23:59
I think by the first quarter of next year we could see 6k again.
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:37:53
Bears are now euforic. This drop will not endure so much.
@_date: 2018-12-27 15:10:35
So now Bitcoin is or is not a currency? I don't understand well the article.
@_date: 2018-12-29 21:36:07

BTC: 100%
ALTS:    0%
@_date: 2018-12-29 21:36:28
Just because I didn't sell when I could.
@_date: 2019-05-12 10:32:48
No info. Just the bear market ended, there are no sellers anymore.

@_date: 2018-12-09 21:30:31
All indicators on the charts make me think the real bottom COULD be between 2.5k and 2.8k. this is just my opinion based on analysis of the graph.
@_date: 2018-12-27 18:22:15
I'm not an hater, this is actually the bear market of 2018 reversed. Look.
@_date: 2018-12-30 15:22:58
Everyone is in BTC for money! At least I admit that.
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:29:58
BTC will not die, this for sure.
@_date: 2018-12-31 18:58:30
Let's hope for a better year for Bitcoin! Happy new year!
@_date: 2018-12-28 17:34:33
I invested in early september 2017 and, during the bull run, I spent my coins and doing so withdrawn the initial investment capital. I am still in profit even if BTC goes to 0.
@_date: 2019-05-09 19:43:48
That's true ��
@_date: 2018-12-31 21:43:25
Yes, but I talk also about prices. I'd love to see Bitcoin at 10k again.
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:38:24
Thank you!
