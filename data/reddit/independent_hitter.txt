He said that because there are banks that will refund ATM feeds up to a certain amount, so if you don't get an account with that feature you have no one to blame but yourself.  Microeconomic analysis doesn't even need to be brought up as it's not a complicated statement to understand.  I'm not saying that I agree but I think you are severely misunderstanding what he meant.

His argument was that because there are banks that offer a certain amount of ATM fee rebates per month that choosing to bank somewhere that doesn't offer that perk is not rational.
I don't agree since there are lots of other things to consider when choosing a bank, but I hardly see how you can justify your claim that he's delusional.

The company reinvented itself and merged with Time Warner.  Their product and service portfolio has nothing to do with what they did in the 90s.
My point was that nobody uses them for the services that they were offering in the 90s.  Bitcoin is not a company and doesn't have the ability to morph into something completely different than what it is today.  The Bitcoin technology has the ability to be used for all kinds of things, but not Bitcoin the crypto-coin.

I apologize for your poor reading comprehension skills.  I said that the protocol has value, but by virtue of it being open-source that it cannot be captured by single cryptocoin such as Bitcoin.  It will eventually be replaced and become the MySpace of cryptocurrency.

Actually he is stating that Bitcoin, the technology, can be separated from Bitcoin, the unit of account.
However, it's fairly obvious that the network can also be separated.  The network is a collection of individuals who value mining and/or using Bitcoin versus some other form of money/currency.  Individuals can easily change that value judgement on a whim.  Just like how in the mid-90s millions of individuals used AOL to the extent that AOL was almost inseparable from the internet itself in the USA, but today nobody subscribes to AOL.

Does anybody actually believe this?  There are an infinite amount of cryptocurrencies using an identical protocol as Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is the most popular, but the costs of switching from Bitcoin to another cryptocurrency are basically zero.  So to maintain its value Bitcoin relies entirely on network effects.
Conversely everybody in the world knows what gold is and believes that is valuable.  This is not true for Bitcoin.
There could be an innovation that creates a CryptoCurrency Protocol 2.0 that everyone recognizes as superior to the existing Bitcoin Protocol and renders Bitcoins completely valueless.
Gold will still be gold.
This is a terrible argument and I feel sorry for anyone who buys it.
Yes, Bitcoin absolutely is a pyramid scheme.  For it to increase in value the userbase needs to grow.  There is absolutely no guarantee that that will happen.

You're just digging yourself a deeper hole.


You still need to take responsibility for the delay, which was a breach of the terms of your contract with Andrew.  The delay being out of your hands is immaterial to your customer.  The fact that you dropped your price before you shipped the unit and then refused to refund the difference is astoundingly bad business.


This is obviously a lie since the correspondence makes clear that you told him that it had already been worked on while the machine was still in transit.  It's impossible for you not to be lying.


You breached your contract with him, which led to him incurring significant costs in lost rent and time.  It's your legal duty to make him 100% whole, but you tried to charge a fee.  That is the very definition of **crooked**.


He didn't have to.  You should have agreed to make him whole months beforehand.

The elections aren't the problem, the problem is that we allow the government the ability to dole out so many special privileges to lobbyists and special interests, something that ironically the Kochs are fighting against.  It's wrong to arbitrarily limit the amount that someone can donate to the political causes that they believe in.  Super PACs and the like are groups that engage in political speech on behalf of their donors.  Therefore limiting the amount someone can donate to such a group is an infringement on their ability to promote their causes, which infringes on the First Amendment.  This is heavily supported by over 200 years of case law, despite leftist claims that the Citizens United case "turned money into speech" or "turned corporations into people".
The assumption to the contrary is that American voters are too stupid to see through propaganda and will simply vote for the best funded political causes, so we need to place arbitrary limits on donations even if legally this is a blatant infringement on the First Amendment.  While it's possible, I don't hold such a negative view of the populace.  I prefer upholding the Rule of Law.

Incorrect, shortages and surpluses occur as a result of price controls (price floors or price ceilings).  Moreover, the law of demand is that for normal goods (non-Giffen goods), consumers will demand more of the good at a lower price and less of the good at a higher price (demand curve has a negative slope).  The law of supply is that producers will supply more of the good at a higher price and less of the good at a lower price (supply curve has a positive slope).
What you claimed to be the laws of supply and demand are both incorrect statements and not the laws of supply and demand.  The only thing that you got right are the situations under which higher or lower equilibrium prices occur.
You failed to refute my previous point, which was that demand and supply operate independently of another.
TL;DR You need to go back to school.

Here's the takeaway that BTC cultists don't pick up on.  The technology behind the Bitcoin protocol is highly valuable.  However, since it is an open-source protocol, that value cannot be easily captured.
Note that Bill Gates emphasizes the ability to build on top of the technology, or to build something else that's similar  but different in some key respect.  Any of these developments could render Bitcoin itself completely valueless.
It all comes back to the intrinsic value argument.  Bitcoin has an intrinsic value of zero.  The technology itself has loads of value, but by the virtue of it being open-source, it is impossible for Bitcoin to permanently monopolize the value created by the underlying protocol.

You're suggesting that implies that they aren't able to challenge the prosecution's witnesses, which as I've pointed out is obviously untrue.  Where do you get off saying this is a sham trial?
