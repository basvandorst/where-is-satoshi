It takes a while to get into your account. About 2 weeks for me

No thing as canceling a transaction with bitcoin.  Once you hit send, it’s gone.

My gf had a TREZOR and loves it

Yea I agree it’s poorly put together.  They are probably making so much they don’t care to keep the project updated. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:02:26
You should be embracing new people coming into the market.  They are driving the price and your worth up.  It’s a network effect. The more in the system the greater the value of the system is.  
TLDR:  The more people you help, the more your investment is worth.

I’m not really sure there is anything you can do to “speed up” the transaction. Once it’s sent you just have to wait it out. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:35:40
There shouldn’t be fees. But I’m not positive

Love me a heckin good contest. Followed both.

Doesn't seem like a scam at all......��

Why is that? For ruining your attempt to profit from people who are unaware?
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:58:30
Pure theory. It could collapse like anything in this economy but there is a lot of people with a lot invested and a failure isn’t an option for most
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:39:08
Wait for the dust to settle, but cheap and defeated coins, profit.
@_date: 2017-09-19 03:05:54
Thanks! I'll check it out 
@_date: 2017-09-06 14:45:20
^what this guy said. It's great for what you want
@_date: 2017-09-19 12:40:41
I should find a shirt that says this and out it in the store hahaha
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:38:56
I agree with you.  Look into some vegan bodybuilders though if your looking for a small change. Eating beans will get you better protein than chicken will.  Not trying to change your beliefs at all, just pointing some random info out :)
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:35:25
Haha I'm sorry! If you check our main site we have some vegan recipes.  I'm just starting out so shopping food is still in the realm of impossible. My gf makes some bomb ass mango kombucha I might try to throw up on their sometime though.

Servers never claim their cash tips anyways since there is no proof they actually received them.  I'm sure the same could be held for bitcoin (for now). As someone who's worked in restaurants for years I think bitcoin tipping would be amazing in the industry. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:46:46
I'll give that a watch later!  Thanks for the info I honestly know nothing about body building so I appreciate you setting my info straight. My specialty is cooking not nutrition haha.
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:51:46
There's 2 documentaries that will give you a solid overview of everything crypto. Banking on bitcoin is on Netflix.  They don't really provide any technical aspects on how to purchase any, but they provide some solid info. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:35:16
Probably nothing. They all have there positives and negatives. But I'm not expert and can't predict and unpredictable market. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:37:17
Yea that's what our whole focus is.  Anyone can buy fake meatballs and throw it in spaghetti.  It's not really even healthy at that point. We're focused on using whole plant based stuff the least amount processed as possible and we're making it look/taste good!  Thanks for check us out though!
@_date: 2017-09-01 02:05:22
Nobody knows.  If we did we would all be millionaires!  You could wait for a dip that never comes or purchase before a huge crash. So no time like the present
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:41:23
Someone else in the class is doing the darknet so we will probably touch on that but not go in depth.  I wanna focus on more of the technology aspect of it as a decentralized global currency.  Probably she away from the investing standpoint because it's a tech class and not a business class
@_date: 2017-09-19 12:42:31
Thanks!  I was looking around briefly and couldn't really find many vegan web stores that accepted it. It won't be a huge selling factor but it's a cool feature. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:30:35
I honestly have read into much of those topics so that will be a good place to start!  Yea my team mates are on board but really have no idea what they are getting into.  +3 people for crypto coming soon
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:43:57
Credit tips are auto reported. Most just use that as there claims. Some new places are making servers claim 1/4 their total sales and charging then tax on that. It's a broken system. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:50:34
Right now I view bitcoin as an asset. It's not really spendable where I live currently so it's hard to use it as a currency.  My girlfriend and I pay each other back using bitcoin though.  I think in the future either bitcoin or another faster/lower fee altcoin will be used as currency. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:45:27
Just submitted my business. I'll have to figure out how to add a discount specific For bitcoin though.

As someone who lives in Rochester and drives by the old Kodak factory. This sure hits home
