Blockhain still my favourite. Feels stable, robust and certainly has more features than any other wallet out there.
I mean seriously, they've been around for years and have these features (sweep key, import priv. key, archive addresses, labels, send from selected address, shared coin, etc.).  
I especially like the fact that they don't force me to use HD wallets which I completely despise.

Change it to whatever you want. Blockchain.info was never hacked and you're just making your wallet list look biased if you put down hacked.
Here's the thing: a lot of users have had their funds stolen from VARIOUS online wallets. That doesn't mean they were hacked. It just means you're hearing about the BC wallet more because it's the oldest and most popular.  
Plus, half of the list under 'hacked' link just show how stupid people really are. Like the guy with TeamViewer open, same password as his wallet and his email, and same one he uses to sign-up on a shady 'get free bitcoin' website. Yeah... that sure is a 'hack' alright.

Yep, scammers are there, but you were kind of an idiot to think you can buy a gift card and just hang on to it and everything would be fine.  
I bet you're one of those guys that had their 'blockchain hacked' wallets...

Banks banned them from using Bitcoin or allowing their customers to transfer to any Bitcoin-related business so they complied.
It's a nice service, but they are complete pussies:

In the world where you can buy them through someone who you absolutely do not know, over the internet, with magical internet money.

If you tell me a way to properly assess it...  
I mean I must have bought at 100 different prices from 20 or more channels... absolutely do not know how to even get an approximate.

Yes, he does. You're the one who doesn't.
Just because there's the possibility of someone using a stolen credit card doesn't mean Brawker doesn't keep full logs of transactions and can link your delivery to an exact credit card on their website. It really is a no-brainer, and the police won't end up knocking on your door because they would follow the lead - and that lead... well, it leads to asking information from Brawker which stops them from coming to you in the first place.
How do you think credit card fraud is investigated? They just look randomly where it was delivered and go there and arrest whoever answers the door? Are you really that naive?  
The delivery address doesn't matter at all - because that means ANY POOR FAGGOT could be put in prison by someone else.  
What matters is everything else. IP from where the card was used, other connections of that card (on what other websites was it used, does that delivery also match your address?), your own history, plus, like I said, ANY investigation would always lead to a request of data from Brawker which would immediately exclude your sorry ass.

Yeah, basically that.  
@_date: 2015-02-16 15:50:58
Then what the fuck are you doing here? is that way.

I'm definitely looking for an app like this for Android.
