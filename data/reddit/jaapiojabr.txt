Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange hacked in 2014. Huge amount bitcoin stolen. 200k bitcoin resqued. Bitcoin back those days 600 dollars. After years of legal works these bitcoins have to be sold for yen to compensate victems. Yesterday they dumped like 35000 bitcoin.
Now go back to playing outside and coloring elmo pictures.
