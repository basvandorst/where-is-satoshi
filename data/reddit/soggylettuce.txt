Just remember to never invest more than you can afford to lose...who knows, bitcoin could crash and burn.

Not cool but I guess the arbitrage is gone. So maybe it's a good thing?
@_date: 2013-06-24 02:21:22
Ah I see, I was not aware that they were using in house made chips. I'm hoping Avalon ships soon so I can get my hands on a few k16's. And yea I am really looking forward to a price war between companies.

Honestly this is almost a big of a waste of time as the advertising sites where you click ads to get a few satoshis are. You need to mine 80,000 blocks to get the equivalent of a dollar. If you have ever played minecraft you might place 80,000 blocks over the course of a week if you played for hours on end. I guess it's a cool gimmick to get people hooked to your server but I just think your post is a bit misleading as to the difficulty of actually getting something worthwhile. 
In 15 minutes time they could just go to bitvegas and claim the free prize which was worth like half a mBTC last time I was on instead of mining/placing 2000 blocks.
@_date: 2013-06-17 00:04:21
Care to translate?
Also as a response to your post you can always just go with the most reputable seller and use escrow.

The argument was putting everything into bitcoins as the 17 year old above was saying he was putting it all into btc for a house. That isn't diversification.

I decided to try it with .1 at the rate of 14.20 and I received it in under an hour surprisingly...glad to see a site that is up (for now) that I can actually use paypal on. If you can use it while it's still here.

no mflb?
@_date: 2013-06-16 21:59:12
It's not just the trends that have lead myself to infer what I have. With the amount of avalon chips going to be shipped in july-august I believe it is a very logical assumption no? 
Sure their could be an unlikely situation where the block-erupters pay for themselves but all evidence points towards that being unlikely.
@_date: 2013-06-02 20:21:15
Why so high? I mean at the current echange rate (119) you basically paid 238 for the miner. Anyone else could get in on a group buy or buy off of another website in the 250's range. Why the 150 markup? Are people that thick?
@_date: 2013-05-28 02:23:59
So it's all still under my client but divided up into individual addresses?

I think the design is fine but the I is a little weird and Satoshi is not supposed to be found out. He is who he is and finding out the exact identity would be detrimental. I don't think things that encourage the hunt for satoshi are a good thing. Maybe try a more generic design? A clever mining phrase maybe? 
@_date: 2013-09-22 21:28:04

On an unrelated note, is MinePeon going to have support for the upcoming klondike miners/does it already?
@_date: 2013-04-06 00:54:51
Thanks man but I looked at it and it says you need to have a 30 day account so it looks like I'm going to have to find someone that will do a trade with me over paypal.

Yifu has done nothing to prove that the chips have even been shipped out. Even if those 20 batches of chips are stuck in customs as he claims that is barely 30% of the total ordered.

Thanks for the constructive criticism. This post sure was useful.
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:08:08
Thanks man.
What would be the lowest amount that you would be able to set as a minimum? What if you had a minimum coinbase fee applied for orders under that limit so people could still order amounts under the minimum and only have to pay what would normally be a fee for $10?
@_date: 2013-07-02 23:46:05
Isn't asicminer supposed to be releasing new products in like 10 days or so? 
If so do you think you will be doing the same thing with the new blade, halfblade, and possible new USB miner?
@_date: 2013-06-16 18:16:05
They have always been 1.99 btc from asic miner. You can buy in batches of 50 units only though so group buys are usually organized on bitcointalk. The average price is usually like 2.1 after shipping and such. People have been taking advantage of people's ignorance to these prices and have been marketing asics for only 300 dollars! Get rich quick!
In reality these miners will probably never ROI
@_date: 2013-06-09 19:41:00
you have given as much as they have

Yea he's wearing a KnCMiner shirt.
@_date: 2013-06-23 21:00:10
Yea...I think I'll just wait until they bump it down again to like .49btc once klondike and all the other asics start hitting the market. 
@_date: 2013-06-16 19:58:08
People always make the argument that you could buy it in cash but at that point if you had just bought bitcoins you would have been better off than trying to generate bitcoins through a medium that is not going to make a profit.
@_date: 2013-05-31 16:33:02
Yea that's what I'm planning to do. Just waiting until this or some other fairly small device with at least 200mh comes out for like .5 bitcoin a pop and then have a project that I can actually do with my raspberry pi. 
@_date: 2013-06-16 18:47:02
Where did you get 185 dollars from? The cost is 2 btc
They are making about .01 a day right now at 15mil difficulty
The problem with a lot of these calculators is they don't know what the future difficulty will be.
Sure miners might pay themselves off in 200 days if the difficulty stays the same but that's so unrealistic.
With the amount of avalon chips and new asic miners set to hit starting in august people are predicting difficulties of 100 million.
 With that you would be making about .0017 btc per day per usb miner. That means you initially have maybe 2.5 months of mining with 12mil-20mil difficulty that will net you about .76 btc per asic miner. You then have to make 1.24 btc with a difficulty of 100million+ with 336 mh/second. So even if the difficulty for some reason remained stagnant at 100million it would take a whopping 729 more days to get to your initial 2 btc investment. So all in all we have 804 days for ROI assuming difficulty goes stagnant at 100mil which it will most likely never do.
@_date: 2013-06-17 00:06:35
Well yes but not all of those chips are going to successfully put on boards and it will take time to put them on but it's definitely going to be a crazy spike in difficulty.

Holy crap at all of those block eruptors. Do you mind sharing the ghash you get from this and how much have you made so far?

@_date: 2013-09-10 21:32:02
Honestly do you?
I'm willing to bet it's just that you are blind to the possibility that bitcoin won't succeed in the long term.
Bitcoin is in it's infancy while the dollar has been around for generations. Sure there is inflation but you can hedge against that with diversification. Last week alone we saw a drop to 120 from the 140's. That's about a 16% drop in value. Now try to tell me that the dollar is still riskier while telling me how much the dollar dropped in the last week, hell even in the last year.
@_date: 2013-04-05 22:37:36
Ahaha yea....I guess I would just do that as a last resort as it is not secure for everyone.
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:50:32

It seems like a nice novelty but with your 2btc per miner I don't think your investment will be returned.

@_date: 2013-06-02 20:37:15
Makes sense I guess. Still they never will make their money back unless they had no other way of obtaining bitcoin than mining by spending 400 dollars. But still even for mining gpus would be much cheaper than this. It's amazing what people pay for convenience. 
@_date: 2013-05-28 02:10:48
It's been like this for a few days and all my transactions are confirmed except for my most recent of +.25 
@_date: 2013-06-23 23:38:49
It would take around 120 days at current difficulty to break even and with diffictulty increasing taken into account (even though it's all guessing) you probably won't see ROI on this. If you want to have this as a novelty go ahead but it still isn't a very smart investment. 
If you are serious about getting an asic look into either getting some avalon chips mounted on a klondike board or buy some shares of a bigger rig on bitcointalk from a reputable seller.
@_date: 2013-05-15 18:42:20
It's instant...you just check your email

They may be paying off 1 per day but that will only go on for about 75 days.

@_date: 2013-09-10 21:23:06
Why? 
Saving for a house is a substantial amount of money to just be put at risk like that right?
I'm 16 myself so maybe I don't understand how a sum of money that large is no big deal to lose. Just kidding. It's a fucking house. Don't risk your future on something as silly as this hoping to get rich.

@_date: 2013-06-16 17:18:47
The usb miners may never return their investment because they were 2btc each. Sure it's neat but it may have been better to buy a few and keep the rest of the btc in btc.

Hello egokick! How's the new server been?
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:54:34
Probably because the price was lower. Now that we are at 500 and the minimum is .1btc which translates to $50.

Yea I got out at 2.6 after getting in at like 2.4 and the next day it spiked up but I still made money so I'm happy.
@_date: 2013-07-02 17:41:05
They probably won't ROI because of upcoming difficulty spikes due to asic chips being distributed...Just wait until the price is lowered again or something that will actually ROI comes out.
On a side note this is a question that people keep asking and at this point is getting pretty spammy. Before you ask questions like this search the subreddit, bitcointalk, or even use a mining calculator...It doesn't take a genius to use the recourses sitting right in front of them.
@_date: 2013-07-17 00:51:40
+ALL verify
@_date: 2013-06-16 23:50:09
I don't think the barrier to enter into bitcoin mining is too high. Their are plenty of DIY asic miners with the introduction of avalon chips and you can buy one of these miners at a very reasonable rate on bitcointalk. Their are machines anywhere from 50 dollars and 280 mh/s to thousands of dollars and upwards of 200 gh/s. As long as you are interested enough to research things and not pay a premium for convenience then it is still possible to make profits from mining albeit their could be a chance it fails.
@_date: 2013-07-04 13:04:30

alright thanks
@_date: 2013-07-02 21:12:42
That's a terrible argument because his ROI is hedged on the fact that bitcoin increases in value so it would be much more profitable to put the money into bitcoin itself. I'm sure that buying bitcoin is probably easier than buying miners. OP asked if it was worth it and the simple fact is that it isn't.

@_date: 2013-07-14 21:21:31
I would advise you to research more then. If people consider mining rigs to be an investment then the casascius coins are just as valid.
If I think that the coins are going to be worth more in the future it is an investment.
@_date: 2013-06-14 22:18:01
Very sleek...I plan on doing the same with some k1 miners and a hub.
@_date: 2013-07-14 16:09:39
I would go with 
300 in BTC
300 in Casascius BTC coins
100 in Asicminer
100 in LTC
@_date: 2013-06-24 00:04:44
I doubt it will ever drop below .5
Avalon chip itself costs .1 btc
board components and board itself probably cost them $20 total per unit because of bulk buys (complete estimate feel free to correct me) 
So with that it's $30 leaving them a $20 profit if they sell at .5...
I doubt that they would take less and it will probably take a while to go down to .5 because people will likely buy the shit out of this reduced price even though it still will most likely never ROI
Again I could be completely wrong but this is a very likely outcome. (don't not invest or invest in something because of what someone like me says...do your own research if you want to be certain)
@_date: 2013-09-11 00:02:57
