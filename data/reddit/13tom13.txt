why cant i hear this 
@_date: 2015-06-23 08:45:49
up to you how you want to interpret it, doesn't mean its true.
@_date: 2015-06-22 17:25:06
ETA for when it will go back to normal? im thinking wed/thur?
@_date: 2014-09-28 11:58:37
you should compare it to the number of people who have access to computers and the internet so they could at least hypothetically use bitcoin

i swear it was a mexican subsidiary of HSBC not HSBC itself. Still BS though

the city of london(banking industry) has alot of political and general power; they close down there banks eventually. Localbitcoins or alternative seem to be all we can have

Yh i imagine alot of people will know it due to SR1 being busted and other more minor busts in the news
@_date: 2014-06-01 23:11:27
perhaps its because SR was such a big part in the development and current popularity of bitcoin? I also think that people see a big difference between a leader of a drug cartel for example and a libertarian that is good with technology and came up with a way to facilitate anonymous drug transactions

Some people want to use btc anonymously even tumble coins

Isnt isnt it inflation if its going up in value
@_date: 2014-06-01 21:56:28
sounds like your trying to get more listeners/money. I thought there would at least be some analysis of why you thought that. Even if they didn't get him on that they will get him on something the us gov is determined
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:25:02
no surprise as far as im aware its smart to assume anything that isnt opensource does or might have gov/company backdoors built in... theres a reason zuckerberg covers his webcam and tapes over his comps microphone. I should think the same goes for mobile phone operating systems

find someone local on LBC and buy in person with cash?
@_date: 2015-10-17 21:40:42
can you update your wallet to this? or do you have to un-install then download and use the seed to your wallet
@_date: 2016-05-20 15:26:06
good for you, im not sure i would do the same 
@_date: 2015-10-18 10:25:56
ohh well im on windows so it might be different but thats good you can do it on mac makes it more likely you can on windows. last update i did i uninstalled and re installed it i gotta find out how to update it it would just be way easier 
@_date: 2013-07-24 15:20:49
I glanced at it and thought it was just a question you were asking, didnt realize twas a link (new to Reddit - enjoying it though)
@_date: 2013-07-24 14:55:37
 
This was inspired by the gov taking money out of everyones bank account to bail themselves out
@_date: 2013-07-30 12:12:39
always side with the buyer...
@_date: 2013-07-31 13:41:42
So why did they side with the buyer in this case? If they treat the customers with mistrust they will lose business

BTC FTW
@_date: 2013-07-24 14:26:46
there already is one in greece for sure
@_date: 2013-07-24 15:16:11
Oh well i saw the headline and read the story at the time, Bitcoins were the talk at the time so i thought they might go for it.
