I can only hope and dream it will happen

Really?  So, all Reddit users expect to outlive all old people?

Hmmm.  Didn’t think it was that complicated.  Buying and selling stocks requires fiat.  If the value of fiat is like it is in Venezuela, would you not look for alternative currency to trade in?  Never mind

Bitcoin provides a service to securely transfer and store wealth.  It’s volatility makes it unattractive, but it is in its infancy stage.  As usage increases, even Gates, Buffet, and Munger will want to use to preserve their wealth.  Fiat days are numbered due to counterfeiting, government over spending, central bank printing, and bank corruption.

Or everyone who has a job based on pay in fiat.
Need employers to auto pay to decentralized exchanges in the further.
Still, crypto will become more attractive to use than fiat and everyone, including the rich, will have to transact in crypto.  Even rich people sell assets.

With their wealth, they will live much longer than the rest of us,  Health care sucks for the poor and middle class.

If inflation is high in fiat, transactions will be costly.  Crypto by that time will be a smarter currency to use.  Hopefully

How old are you?  I don’t think you would speak that way to my face.  Grow up.

Gov can’t buy it all since not everyone would sell.  Price would just go up since supply is limited.   No one can control since decentralized network prevents this.  Only a complete shutdown of the internet would stop bitcoin.  Multiple EMP attacks on each continent might work if protection wasn’t setup.

Bitcoin rise in price is done honestly via math and demand.  Fiat inflation is from central bank printing for gov spending and bank cheating.  Which would you rather be a part of?

I hope I live long enough to watch Munger, Gates, and Buffet eat their words when they are forced to invest in crypto to preserve their wealth while fiat inflates to infinity.

California sucks I think because of the free health care we provide to all immigrants-illegal or not.  Citizens have to pay or lose their credit rating
