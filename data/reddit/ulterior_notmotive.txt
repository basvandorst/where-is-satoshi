Intel, Campbell Soup, Zipcar, Dropbox, McDonnell Douglas, Hewlett-Packard, Cisco, 3Com, Texas Instruments, Bose, Akamai, iRobot, VMWare, Genentech, Raytheon. From Wikipedia: "MIT alumni have formed 25,800 companies, employing more than three million people including about a quarter of the workforce of Silicon Valley. Those firms between them generate global revenues of about $1.9 trillion a year. If MIT were a country, it would have the 11th highest GDP of any nation in the world."

These specific properties are in a community that's looked after by caretakers, neighbors, and maintenance folks, plus it's gated. There'd be no way for squatters to stay for the requisite one year to claim adverse possession.

This precisely highlights the difference between us. I'm not betting on what the market's willing to bear to make a buck, because I'm not speculating on the price. I'm betting on the technology and its growth stability; I don't think for a second that anything can sustain logarithmic growth forever, but I also don't think it's going to stall out and just plateau for years -- and I say that because I know a disruptive technology when I see one; I'm saying, "I think that this distributed, programmable, one-way, verifiable transaction ledger has more disruptive potential and enables more variety of utility in ways we've only begun to imagine, coalesced into one single protocol, than anything we've seen to date; it's a solution to a ton of problems, ones we haven't dreamed up yet."
Can I name you 10 people today who think that's worth $2000 for a single slice of that ledger? No. Like a lot of people say all the time: this thing is either going to be worth nothing (not because it isn't useful, but because a problem is discovered with it), or a huge amount. You don't have to believe, but you waste your time and precious karma trying to convince the people who do believe in this thing, of which the money is secondary, because of futuristic visionary ideology this community holds (which sounds superbly religious, and I guess it may well be).

My experience is through DSL and 3G dongle while there - both very comparable to my folk's rural bandwidth here in the US. LTE started being deployed last year, so coverage is now becoming more widespread, and pricing looks similar to US cable services. Not sure what, if any, data caps there would be, but haven't seen them with 3G.
This sums it up nicely, and jives with my experience:

It's been growing logarithmically over... you know what, I just don't have it in me today. Just go look up additional ways bitcoin is stunningly versatile in addition to being currency; if you don't think a distributed, programmable transaction ledger has that kind of value, and might indeed hold some pretty outstanding value by the market someday, I don't know what to tell you.

Same reason why some people believe "Bitcoin went bankrupt." During their daily information deluge some afternoon they heard "blah Bitcoin blah Japan blah Bitcoin exchange blah filed for bankruptcy blah investors damages."
Hopefully some day, with the hard work and creativity going on now to release easy to use applications on top of the protocol, they'll be using it without knowing they're using it. I wonder what percentage of people who use the Internet know what TCP/IP is?

Misleading title - you make it sound like the folks here feel self-important about it. Rather, the writer of the article is chiding the writing of another article. And 'ROFL', really?

You're exactly right, thanks! I had logs on my mind.

Also, please come back and let us know how it goes. It's always valuable to hear feedback, especially because most folks here are comfortable with Bitcoin and might forget that it may be a little daunting before you make that first transaction. This is one place to reach both the Bitcoin supporters as well as the people who are working in the industry (like the top poster who's with one of the exchanges).
