True. But have you seen the gold fluctuation? Have you compared it with crypto in general? 
If gold drops or rises max 3 dollars (roughly saying) bitcoin drops and rises way higher. Looking at the charts, bitcoin drops and rises to $1000+ overnight and in minutes.

Hmm. Regarding the government, they will surely get into the pants of every exchange. No doubt. Almost all exchanges now have KYC and matter of time for all of them to include KYC or else they will just shut down the website by introducing statements as "drug, terrorist or anytime bad... It's easy tho and you know it. Anonymous exchanges to avoid government involvement? Crypto community would not trust that exchange except obviously 
I am not saying flactuation does not happen with other assets. They do but fluctuation is not like bitcoin. At this moment, now, it's better to use gold and silver to buy goods...
You may want to say , "just wait for some years and price fluctuation will stabilise", but that's just a promise of "if" than "when".
No doubt blockchain is innovative technology. Blockchain 2.0 is far better.
The question here is all about fluctuation and avoiding daily manipulation. What better ideas we could have except asking exchanges to limit the readings per head?
@_date: 2019-07-29 18:24:32
We r almost in the same track and I am sure we will end up with the same thoughts. We can use bitcoin to buy goods but it is useless to do so. The seller surely gains when he sells good with bitcoin as he will use instant btc to usd conversion that sells bitcoin right away after payment is complete. But the seller will receive usd back. The buyer is in trouble as 1 pizza today might cost you 0.001btc but tomorrow it may cost you 0.0001btc. You will regret of purchasing but not the seller as the seller already converted btc into usd right after the transaction is made. 
This is something I am asking to figure out solution which will be good for us. Crypto plays both. Gold and fiat. It is digital &amp; virtual currency and an asset store of value. In other words: pizza + burger + lemon + pepper + vinegar = food that is difficult to eat and survive. Lol
The same is for gold that's why gold are not used much to buy stuff. 
Good to read your points mate.
@_date: 2019-07-29 16:49:09
Not argument but would want a sort of idea sharing

@_date: 2019-07-29 20:37:29
Back in days we worked on this content. Perhaps you want to have a look. It needs to be updated tho.
@_date: 2019-07-29 16:25:25
Which I have mentioned mate. As an shop owner, would you start accepting any form of crypto not know what would be the value with those crypto tomorrow? The main subject and concern is the flactuation. But would appreciate to see your your points on them.
@_date: 2019-07-25 19:27:20
Dead lol
@_date: 2019-07-29 16:48:14
Good start. Thank you for this.
Also want to ask. Crypto market in general reaching 1trl market cap means 50% to 70% of them comes from bitcoin and that would be like 1btc = to $70k to $90k or above. 
Whales (early adopter who hold above 100btc ) could and potentially keep driving prices down and up and that is equivalent to again from %0.4 to max %1 flactuation daily which is again from $100 to $1000. It would be all about buy low and sell high game for them. 
I think, we as a crypto community if we don't request exchanges (bunch of them) to set a limit daily in $ trading, we won't be able to avoid manipulation. 
Can you suggest anything here?
@_date: 2019-07-29 18:04:47
10,000 btc for 1 pizza? Haven't seen people who say I bought that or this for xx btc now I regret? Please refer to the whole point.

Bro. They, u, me and us are loaded already. But not your brother, sister and other members of your family who will be asking the same questions to you once they are interested in crypto.
@_date: 2019-07-29 20:29:09
Thanks for these info. Makes a lot sense. In fact sounds fact.
I don't see crypto market reaching 1 trillion market cap in near future unless if we slightly change our perspective and goals for them. In the sense of breaking it into "usage phases". The mention above as "payment" is useless to consider now. Compare the bitcoin price with gold example. Look at the price fluctuations in $ &amp; %. It would make more sense to buy goods with gold than bitcoin. 
But it is what it is so totally agree with you. We live we see.

**Schedule for Upcoming ETF:**
At this point we don't think we should hold our breaths for any other ETFs except CBOE. CBOE is basically the only one that would have a chance to be accepted in our eyes. But let's see.
**CBOE VanEck / SolidX ETF** \- 30th September 2018
**TL;DR: Here’s what makes the VanEck/SolidX ETF different.**
If you don’t know what differentiates the VanEck and SolidX ETF and why it gives it a massive advantage over other ETFs that have been thus far rejected, here are the main points for you to better distinguish between the same:
**1. Custody:** Fund is physically backed and will hold BTC (Private Keys)
**2. Designed for institutions not retail:** Minimum $200K investment. This gives the SEC more confidence in protecting retail investors.
**3. Backed by CBOE:** to be traded on BZX Equities Exchange. CBOE has already pushed through Futures and has a long standing history with the SEC.
**4. Regulatory oversight:** the CBOE is a trusted and regulated exchange in the eyes of the SEC
**5. Index will be traded on a OTC (over the counter) desk by Voice not Electronically:** this reduces risk of manipulation and increases regulatory transparency.
**6. Insured:** ETF is insured by a syndicate of A-rated insurers. Again, more assurance and protection for investors.
**7. Both VanEck and SolidX have filed for ETFs independently:** together, they bring to the table more experience and lessons learned than any other applicant.
Well, there you have it. Other ETFs have had some of these components but nothing has come close to be as robust and comprehensive as this ETF.
The Delay is a sign of confidence, as It demonstrates the SEC’s interest in continuing to do proper due diligence versus out right rejecting it.

The good thing on this chart is to look at the price history and where it is moving. In long term obviously. Secondly, it provides information about Rewards Halving which is good for newbies to know. We worked hard to bring this to you.

Watch the y and x exis and see how the trend is moving. The chart is not promising u anything. Just showing how thing are going and if it keeps on going the same direction or negative. If negative then we are going back to 0. If positive then McAfee is going to have a good bbq of ***.

ETN is certainly not a new product but it's new for bitcoin market. However, it's just another hollow product because it doesn't settles for actual asset, instead it trades on the prevailing price of an asset. So people will be trading on the bitcoin price without actually holding bitcoins and there is no way for physical delivery. needless to say, it will not bring any impact on the bitcoin market and no fresh funds will be infused there. Zero impact initiative! Seems like regulated entities found another way to play with investor's money in the name of an unregulated asset!

It was quite difficult to draw it on this large scale graphic. Especially measuring it perfectly is  what makes it tough. But tried the best tho focusing on general "visualization of Bitcoin history and where it is moving". We r too bullish that it can easily cross 100k by 2020. What do you think ?

Anything that asks your age, purpose, and questions as why, what, when and where, is actually centralized world. Yes, ofcouse, the keep environment safe, you need some sort of verification. But age, especially, should not stand in mid of anybody when it comes to use of bitcoin...

I guess another point to include here is that the meaning of HODL.
HODL is more about "not selling your coin on exchange" which results in market price.
You are free to purchase goods if you wish to. At least that's the purpose of owning a going. The merchants who accept Bitcoin as a payment is growing and feel free to use your coin to buy car, shirts and other good you wish to.

I have shared similar graphic in r/btc and was nearly bomarbed with block size questions and critics if btc. Didn't know bcash manages that. First time was really shocked and asked myself what the hell is happening with bitcoin enthusiasts..

Agree. They must be new here. New by saying, most entered only last year. People, I guess like you, who has been in crypto at least from 2014, will see this chart (infographic chart) way more positive and plan accordingly to its future. Altho, not sure what might, could or possibly happen by 2024, but here it is clear to see where bitcoin is moving. In addition, the chart informs about the mining rewards and it's time change.
