Do you get your news from reason.com?  Stats on audits by income brackets, not economics.

They are working towards a lot more automation in place now and out source blockchain analysis to vendors like chainlalysis. They’re doing less in person interviews and just sending you a letter if things don’t add up now on their system. 
You made a lot of assumptions here... Its well known lower income gets more audits than high incomes lately. Because billionaires have lawyers and they don’t want to deal with them. Look up stats rather politics.

You also can’t claim long term capital gains without reporting what you have first... It’s not exactly their job to prove you’re guilty. It works the other way around during an audit.

....Have you ever been in an audit or talked to anyone who has? I’m guessing not... There are random ones and also ones that go off red flags in the system. You can bet crypto users that don’t report are low hanging fruit, especially from coinbase. You have a higher percentage of getting an audit from being a plebe than someone in the 1%. 
When you have an entire community saying “fuck taxes”, you can bet they’ll take a closer look and want to collect their part. Especially how easy tracking Bitcoin is now.

I know of one personally, but it was a criminal case to begin with anyways. 
They are collecting data and automating it. This is even easier for them than Panama/Switzerland. Chainalysis works with the IRS and Binance, you’d have to be a fool to think the IRS hammer doesn’t come down on crypto tax cheats.

What are you talking about.. You can’t transfer money into a bank with Bitmex and US customers are banned. Most traders used it for leverage as far as I know.
Are you strictly speaking of not reporting capital gains on crypto to crypto trades?
