Yes, there is no need for a hard fork at all, everything, even scalability for micro transactions and every imaginable use, can be done with applications on top. I don't know why is so hard for many to understand this, or maybe they do it because financial incentives to try to disrupt or slow down bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-18 05:14:24
Yes, you may be up to something, here is some circumstantial evidence that you may be right:
* 1) Chinese volume in all exchanges is going up fast, so either they are selling more or buying more.
* 2) It seems they are buying, since the price gap (east vs west) is closing slowly. The gap was up to $60 in the last few days, now is only around $20 and closing.
* 3) OkCoin China and OkCoin USD price is just a few dollars apart (right now only $1) when it has been normally around $20 less in China.
 
* 4) Buying ratio is now ~~1:1~~ (US vs China), when it has been consistently lately from 3:1 to 6:1 (more volume on US than China).
Edit: From 1:1 now China volume is close to double than US.

That's the exact same thing people said when it hit $1, then $10, then $100, now at $1000 and will continue to say at $10,000, $100,000.... and so on.

Nice, buy the dip (I did), welcome FUD news from China anytime. If the inspections/regulation is real, then that's GOOD NEWS ^^TM for the long term, we want more stable and regulated exchanges around the world, and with that, the Chinese government it's further legitimizing bitcoin, so expect new waves of adopters there and all around the world.

Bitcoin is a worldwide-distributed decentralized peer-to-peer censorship-resistant trustless and permissionless deflationary system/currency (see Blockchain technology) backed by mathematics, open source code, cryptography and the most powerful and secure decentralized computational network on the planet, orders of magnitude more powerful than google and government combined.

I posted in another thread regarding the panic sell:




@_date: 2017-01-17 04:26:46
Panic-selling was over days ago, then stability and now the bearish sentiment it's officially over (for now), for the first time since the last POBC related drop/correction  China exchanges have surpassed  Bitstamp prices (just by little). Chinese are buying again, now without margin loans, hopefully most of the buyers are hodlers now.
@_date: 2017-01-11 22:14:49
I've been following those trends for years now and I agree 100% with that, it's the way it has worked for the last few years, at least. Once panic selling is over by the Chinese, we most likely see a dramatic reversal upward.

Bitcoin's price is still ridiculously low right now if you do the math. Bitcoin is extremely scarce and will be much more unavailable as time goes on.
Imagine that somebody told you in the 90's that there would be 21 million shares of the Internet, ever. If you had one of those hypothetical shares, you would be a millionaire now. Whoever owns one bitcoin now and holds it for a few decades, will be set for a wealthy retirement.
You will not hear so much about bitcoins then, since everything will be priced in 'millibits', 'satoshis', etc.

That's correct, silly the ones panic selling on this news. After the dust settles, expect the bull market to resume. But even this dip is good, since the sellers are the Chinese, giving up cheap coins to real hodlers around the world.

Hope he is right again, the web-bot has been somewhat accurate regarding bitcoin prices and movements
@_date: 2017-01-06 13:36:26
That's right, it worked again because we have a massive amount of newbies that don't know better and panic sold (both west and east). Well, I guess they have to learn also how to ride this horse.

WTF, 100th monkey syndrome?

When this "bubble" pops the price will "crash down" to $3000 usd. This run/cycle/"bubble" has barely started.
@_date: 2017-01-04 03:35:50
WTF?, That "high" was the MtGox catastrophe, a centralized shady company that deceived many folks, part of the 'growing pains' of every new tech. Since then it has been growing steadily and organically with great development on its ecosystem. The Blockchain has been proven very stable and anti-fragile, the more is attacked the stronger it gets.

FUD, that was not a hack by any means. It is a shame how many trolls attack one of the most solid companies on the Bitcoin ecosystem that has helped many people to get started. Coinbase is very safe, they keep &gt;99% of the coins in cold storage offline. Their vault is a great service and there is much more probable for most bitcoiners to lose the coins if storing them themselves.

 Bitcoin, just like the internet/email are no bubbles, are decentralized systems, the CENTRALISED companies created around them can become a bubble and eventually fail, but Bitcoin is here to stay, the future currency will be totally digital (e-coin/centralized vs bitcoin/decentralized).

Nice to see a positive view of Bitcoin on r/worldnews (this news was posted there):
@_date: 2016-12-13 22:28:26
The future economy will be totally digital and decentralized. Bitcoin is a worldwide-distributed decentralized peer-to-peer censorship-resistant trustless and permissionless deflationary system/currency (see Blockchain technology) backed by mathematics, open source code, cryptography and the most powerful and secure decentralized computational network on the planet, orders of magnitude more powerful than google and government combined. There is a limit of 21 million bitcoins (divisible in smaller units). "Backed by Government" money is not backed by anything and is infinitely printed at will by Central Banks. Bitcoin is limited and decentralized.
**Receive and transfer money, from cents (micropayments) to thousands:**
* Almost for free (a few cents fee).
* Borderless (no country can stop it from going in/out or confiscate)
* Trustless (nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work)
* Privacy (no need to expose personal information)
* Securely (encrypted cryptographically and can’t be confiscated)
* Permissionless (no approval from central powers needed)
* Instantly (from seconds to a few minutes)
* Open source (auditable by anybody)
* Worldwide distributed (from anywhere to anywhere on the planet)
* Censorship resistant (no government can stop its use)
* Peer-to-peer (no intermediaries with a cut)
* Portable (easier to carry/move than cash, gold and silver)
* Public ledger (transparent, seen by everybody)
* Scalable (each bitcoin is divisible down to 8 decimals)
* Decentralized (distributed with no single point of failure)
* Deflationary (its supply goes down with time until reaching 21 million ever)
* Immutable global registry (can’t be altered/hacked by nobody)
* No chargebacks-No fraud ('push' vs' 'pull' transactions).﻿
*And that’s just as currency, Bitcoin has many more uses and applications.*
