What if Interpol got several (and i mean 10's of thousands) complaints about market manipulation that is costing people billions? Even in bitcoin they'd have to at least try, right?

in a nutshell: some whiny bitcoin holders want to make their own rules, so they're cloning bitcoin with some tweaks. No one really expects the new coin (2x) to actually be worth anything, but that will not be determined until it happens

21 million bitcoins, plus the 84 million litecoins that it will be able to swap with instantly, for free. oh and the 84 million vertcoins. and whatever decred's cap is. and i hear monero is working on swaps. don't they have unlimited cap?

for every 100 holders, one may die without telling anyone of their coins or how to get them. That may add up over time, but we don't really have to care considering there will technically be hundreds of millions of bitcoins soon.

The reason is that since there are 4x as many Vertcoins than bitcoins, so the interval is cut into a 4th... I wouldn't say "copy", rather "improved".
