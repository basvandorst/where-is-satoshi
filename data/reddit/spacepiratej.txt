So I’m [Space Pirate Johnson]( a pirate from another dimension. 
I've made a series of clues and puzzles to find the best pirate in the galaxy. The first person to crack the codes will win a bitcoin I've hidden deep in yer internet's pipes. 
The first puzzle is an app based on yerr Augment Reality technology and it's available on [android]( and [iOS]( 
 Yeh'll download it, and then point the app at [the map](  
The rest is up to you.
- UPDATE - WE HAVE A WINNER
Thanks tonnes for playin yeh scurvy bit-dogs, would like to congratulate for being able to crack it using coding, cryptography and lateral thinking.
I may run another hunt and if yeh've finished the game yeh'll be the first to know

yar it aint a prank 
and the more ye share 
the link ye found in open air 
the less chance there is 
for you to win 
the bitcoin is hidden 
just look within

argh so i made a test version
and thought it was fun
it turned out to be harder
than building a sun
to create two apps
and a series of puzzles
get them submitted and bug tested
it left me befuddled
what was to be a week
turned out to be a year
indiegame dev is harder
than i thought

arrrrrr! yeh've unfuddled me muddles!
Yeh've bejiggled me riddles!
Since you're obviously the greatest crypto pirate that ever lived, I'll be sending down an intergallactic taxi to pick ye up and take yeh to the blockchain nebula for debriefing.
For anyone who missed out, if you've finished the game, you'll get early access to the next one

arghhh when the galaxy has turned
a degree or two
i'll push out a clue for the clue and yehh'll know what ta do
but then it'll be a race
so get ready to lose 
@_date: 2015-04-20 00:23:02
yer emails will be used for two things
 - getting the next clue
 - getting told about the next game
this is mainly a shady strategy to have some fun

@_date: 2015-04-19 12:41:18
yargh ye'll get yer next clue within 16 hrs - the proof will be in the clue but only for those who know how to look.
@_date: 2015-04-20 02:29:47
argh this aint mr squiggle and i aint no blackboard

yargh if ye want to see more augmented reality check out [Tesseract]( who helped me parse this game from 7 dimensions down to four.
