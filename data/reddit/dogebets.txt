Sounds like BS to me, haven't seen any twitters of the hacker

Yep sounds like the USA to me.

Ah. Volatility's been lower, especially for the past 2 months

Very cool. Just tested a 1k deposit and it literally went through instantly. Couldn't deposit any more due to my purchase limit though.

I looked through your comment history in hopes I might be able to reason with and educate someone such as yourself.
I found many posts calling everyone "16 year olds", with 80% of your posts putting others down. This is without even looking at your second page of comments... I really won't be able to help someone who puts others down to make themselves feel superior :'( 
For the record, there's no age limit to using Bitcoin! A 50 year old can use Bitcoin just as a 25 or 16 year old can. Using "16 year old" as an insult is an insult to Bitcoin itself because it implies only people who are a certain age can use the system.
To anyone else who has keeps an open mind, just remember that the community is the most important thing for anything to succeed! Don't mind the haters, they'll come around eventually. :)

"our projections of order finalization volume indicated that we would need the community's full balance in hot storage"
Does anyone understand what this sentence means? Why would they need all coins in hot storage for "order finalization volume"? What the hell is that?
@_date: 2014-01-12 02:38:01
True. They don't allows non US shipments to be paid with btc.

This poor man is so scared of his bank taking his $150 or even closing his bank account falsely that he has to ask for advice on Reddit. This truly exemplifies the flaw in the centralized currency system we have now. Why in the world should we be afraid of banks stealing our money and closing our accounts unjustly? 
This is exactly the sort of problem Bitcoin and other forms of digital currency such as Dogecoin absolutely fixes. No one else should have access to your money. You shouldnt have to beg your bank for own hard earned money. After all, it is YOUR money.
The most important factor for the success of digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Dogecoin is the adoption of the currency, which directly relates to the strength and growth of the community. Currently, Bitcoin and Dogecoin both always have nearly 1000 redditors online at once on each subreddit. This is an extremely good sign and proves that we as a whole can make progress towards adoption of Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and other altcoins. 
Happy new year everyone! :)

The Chinese and Russians own Bitcoins! It's being used to fund communism!

Using a different device to store passwords is the best idea IMO.
If your computer gets infected, your password manager if used on the same computer can compromise your security.
I use aWallet (Android app) Password Manager which lets you use AES 512 bit encryption for passwords. I backup the data in encrypted form to my computer and USBs reguarly.
This way, passwords are kept separate from where they are entered, making it extremely difficult to hack my important accounts.
I highly recommend anyone with large amounts of value stored in Bitcoin/other coins to use this method, or suggest a better method for security.
I'd personally never use a program that would run on the same device as where I'm entering the passwords, nor would I ever use a built-in cloud based password manager system. This seems about as insecure as you can get.
Basically: aWallet (Android Phone) + Kaspersky Pure 3.0 + Truecrypt Backups

Which exchange charges the least fees in Canada?
Cavirtex charges a huge 1.5% fee. So if I sell 1 bitcoin it'll cost me $12 just to trade 1 single bitcoin. That's actually a ridiculous price, considering if you sold 10 bitcoins it'd cost you $120 just for a single trade.
@_date: 2014-02-18 19:36:40
Thanks for sharing, and please keep us Canadians updated. :P
@_date: 2014-06-22 11:45:01
Perhaps you should purchase in quality. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 20:13:28
Will be trying this too. How's the volume?
@_date: 2014-10-14 01:30:58
Don't be discouraged by the haters, it's just a natural reaction to new things. I look forward to seeing this launch. If it takes off and becomes successful, that would be quite a sight to see.

To be honest, storing Bitcoins in cold storage would have prevented this whole development.

This is dumb. That's like if I treated CAD/JPY/Whatever as a stock and traded USD for that instead of trading actual USD for CAD/JPY/Whatever.
You basically put money in Bitcoins, a currency meant for spending, but obviously cannot spend it if it's treated like shares of a company. 
@_date: 2014-10-17 21:22:48
Holy crap, that's amazing. I never made the connection between US/"Democracy" and the train in Snowpiercer. I love 3rdear's comment a lot as well. He should see the movie if he hasn't.

@_date: 2014-01-04 20:44:37
There's no need for 3+ posts on the same thing to appear on Redditfront page. It makes us look like a pump-and-dump penny stock forum.
@_date: 2015-05-03 14:59:07
Honestly, that sounds really cool.
@_date: 2014-02-18 19:24:54
Unfortunately, it seems that this article was not satire. Professors are not innovators. 
Criticizers of Bitcoin are often people who have never held any amount of Bitcoin. That's why articles such as this containing tons of misinformation pop up.

BitMex uses a multisig wallet and processes withdrawals manually once a day. Not an exchange, though.

If they don't have to, obviously they won't do it. Free market.
@_date: 2015-01-26 05:30:31
Kind of true actually. Their wealth came from suing people and a pyramid.

but china communist! me democracy!

Not anymore, bitstamp.net is officially down for maintenance and they've admitted to being compromised. Check the site.
@_date: 2015-01-30 00:25:55
Trezor wants a monopoly, not a free market.
Trezor is anti-bitcoin and anti-freedom.

So Karpeles used Silk Road funds to pump the price of Bitcoin (Willy bot bitcoin)
@_date: 2015-01-05 11:45:29
Agreed. Bitcoin/altcoin exchanges getting hacked every 2 months is similar to how Bitcoin's prices keep falling due to the free market.
Free markets kinda suck, don't they. Haha.

@_date: 2016-10-16 21:54:24
Looks like a regular app to me. Unless it is sending data to third party servers
The Coins thing could be a mistake, but will knows. People should just use trusted services. Even if that wallet is legit I wouldn't use it anyways

Bitcoin has valid criticisms that I'm not a fan of but none of them are shown in the video. This guy's just an idiot talking about trusting random hackers to store your money.
