If you think people have zero responsibility for getting mortgages they knew they could never afford, and then defaulting, is ENTIRELY the lenders fault....then I don't know what to say.
Banks are predatory as fuck. But the "poor people" and "immigrants" that signed on the dotted line knowing they were lying to get approved for a loan? Yeah, you can't blame the lenders entirely. 
Personal accountability....what's that?

Thank you Veterans for being a willing participant in the military industrial complex war machine that breeds hatred throughout the world and brings terrorism to our shores where our civilian loved ones can be targeted in attacks because you wanted to "serve your country", or more accurately, serve yourself.
Thank you for all you do.

The lizard is being mocked for hoarding gold.
In a Bitcoin sub...
As in, the lizard and his "zionist" gold hoarding conspiracy talk are to be dismissed by the reader as stupid and tin-foil hat-esk.
Is this cartoon not insinuating that gold is for paranoid weirdos?
...and since it was posted in a Bitcoin sub, you could draw the conclusion that the OP was trying to convey the idea that gold is on its way out...and Bitcoin is going to replace it.
How else is this post supposed to be interpreted?

BCH is gonna have plenty of time to catch on.
If I'm adding $5-$10 a day as savings to crypto....if I use BTC (on chain), all those UTXOs are gonna kick my ass when I eventually try to spend and 50% is eaten up by fees.
Yeah yeah yeah, lightning network...I'm with you. But for NOW? Yeah, BCH has utility NOW.
Was talking to a motorbike driver the other day in my country. He wants to start saving in crypto. Set him up with Mycelium...but then realized if this kid saves in 0.002 chunks, he's fucked when he finally goes to spend.
For small amounts, like it or not, BCH is better given where we are NOW. When you accumulate larger amounts, obviously Bitcoin.
The guys making $5-$10 a day, saving in crypto? BCH or LTC all day long, hands down.
BTC has a way to go.

We are going to see a shift in taxation in the US from an income-based system to a more flat tax consumer-goods based system.
Like McAfee said, you can buy a new car or pay taxes. But I think IRS "lifestyle" audits are going to find their way back into play.
Buy that car with undeclared money, hello IRS audit.
Not to mention, we are going to see CIVIL forfeitures skyrocket. 
They will find a way to get their money, whether we like it or not.

Westerners still think who they vote for matters. Viets know it doesn't matter who is on the ballot...it's the same result.
An American hears about a fucked up law and thinks, "Aw well, we need to go in the streets and PROTEST AND CHANGE THIS!"
A Viet just thinks, "Fuck that. I'll find a way around and do it anyway quietly."
I have come to respect the Viet way a lot more.

Proof? I live here.
Just because it's on Google doesn't make it true.
About 3 years ago there was a story on CNBC about how Greece was going to get 1000 Bitcoin ATMs.
See: 
Never happened.
The internet lies. It lies a lot.
As far Vietnam goes, you cannot use crypto as a currency, but owning it and using it as property is 100% legal.
Using it to buy your coffee is illegal.(Much like using USD in Vietnam to buy your coffee is illegal) But owning/using it for any other purpose other than as "currency"? Not a problem. 
I could refer you to some links, but they would be useless to you as they are written in Tiếng Việt.

Yeah man...it is 5 sats NOW....but how long until it's 1200 sats AGAIN?
Imagine this for one second (Not that empathy is a strong suit for you.)
You're 20 years old. Like all 20 year olds, you have a fair understanding of tech, but not nitty gritty details like how to consolidate UTXOs into a single UTXO every month or so while fees are low to keep from "bricking" the dust at some point in the future as fees on-chain inevitably rise. (And they most certainly will, on-chain)
Segwit, UTXO, on chain, off chain, satoshis, blah blah blah...imagine you're not a complete crypto nerd. NONE of this shit makes any sense to most people. You get that, right?
Now imagine you're 20 years old making $15 a day AT MOST riding around a hot SE Asian city, driving customers around using GrabBike
(formerly Uber).
You want to take $5 of your daily income and squirrel it away...but it must be ON CHAIN at present. Why? Because a $40 smartphone is all you have...and $40 is a big fucking deal. All smart phone wallets are ON CHAIN. (The simple, easy to navigate ones are. Mycelium, for example)
How many phone wallets use Segwit anyway? Segwit fees will NOT stay 3 sats/byte forever. You're delusional if you believe this.
So you're saving in $5 bits...NOW. Not in some theoretical future where lightning network exists and is integrated into every wallet...but RIGHT FUCKING NOW.
Your wallet is getting $5 added to it every day....in a month, that is 30 UTXOs. 1200+ sat fees when you try to spend those small inputs in the year 2022 after years of saving ON CHAIN? Yikes.
I realize you're another "Us vs them" thinking kind of idiot. I get that. Gotta be on a team, right?
But have some empathy...not everyone in the world has time to learn crypto at a granular level.
...and why not? Because they are working their asses off in 100°F heat, 12 hours a day, to make as much as you spent on lunch today.
Empathy...learn it, or just kill yourself.
(Side note, I don't even fucking like BCH. This kid could use ANY blockchain for his small deposits. I just picked BCH because it is going to be huge for use cases EXACTLY LIKE THIS.
BCASH BCASH BCASH...god, please grow up.

Did I say that it didn't?
What I said was the BTC price didn't drop to $35 after the $266 bubble. The lowest it fell in 2013 AFTER the $266 bubble was not $35...it was way higher. 
When Silk Road was taken down (BEFORE the second bubble of 2013), the price dropped to $60 before quickly recovering.
@_date: 2018-04-01 03:22:55
Except it never hit $35 after it fell from it's high of $266. I believe the lowest it went was $60 after the US Gov't took down Silk Road several months later.
