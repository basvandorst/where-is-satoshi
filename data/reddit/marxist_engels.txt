So its probably the website that I am using that is holding everything up? The blockchain everything is on seems to still be going through confirmations.

If its Walmart, great. Not a fan of Targets food section though.

We have Martins here in Virginia.

People are excited. Trying to drive them away isn't what we should do as a community.

I want to do my part as well. I am surprised Coinbase or somebody else hasnt stepped up. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:33:06
I'll buy you some and you send me the money by via paypal

Oh shit, if its Kroger, Martins, or Whole Foods, I am going fucking bonkers.

Okay I guess I can't do a donation fund. So what should we do?

That sounds like persuasive consensual sex.

Yeah true. Don't like that they ran out of Germany. Don't like doing business with companies that don't have support state side.

Thank you, Vinny! *clap clap clap* Thank you, Vinny! *clap clap clap*

Damn.

Call your bank and do a chargeback or wait for a response from them and hope they'll honor that price. I am sure they will.

People have had the most success on Bitstamp and Coinbase. I personally use Coinbase and have only had one transaction flagged. Took care of it with support. If you're in the US, definitely use Coinbase.

Vinny is a pimp. Keep up the good work.

Once last comment, I bought 3 gift cards to Chilis through you guys tonight because my brother and I spent more than we should have! Thank you.

I want to bring one to the DC/VA area as well. Just don't have the funds.
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:49:29
Nice. I have the coinbase reddit extension but I really like all the work you've done with Bitcointip. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 07:58:41
On the contrary, mate. Walmart then made GiftCardZen take theirs down because they don't like third parties selling their giftcards anymore.
@_date: 2013-11-03 01:58:51
I saw. Thank you. :)

I lost my job a month ago so I've just been investing my money in Bitcoin. Been working out pretty well if I do say so myself.
