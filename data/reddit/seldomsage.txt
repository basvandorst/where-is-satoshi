This is fantastically interesting. Have you read the whole thing?
At first I was concerned that this lends credibility to the ponzi scheme argument: That an early adopter has a substantial sum of bitcoins and plans to sell into the market as it appreciates. However, the transaction they focused on was a mere 90,000 BTC out of the ~10.7 million BTC money supply, a relatively small fraction. So the owner of the 90k possesses and asset worth only $1.8 million at today's exchange rates. Then again if BTC went to $1000, that would be worth $90 milion.
The most interesting thing about this paper is the set of figures near the bottom. In many cases it looks as though the entity is trying to launder the coins. But if they were really trying to launder them, the transactions wouldn't be so regimented in size and division (see figure 10). So then the question is, what's the motivation?

Exactly. I love how he throws the term snake oil salesman around. In the finance world, most people look at technical analysts in the same light.

Really I'm just brainstorming for bitcoin applications. And only the tax benefit would technically be laundered, since the rest was earned legally.

I think the Bitcoin foundation needs to create some sort of emergency pool. Thousands of TH/s sitting at the ready so that if an attack is launched it can gradually be brought online to stem the attack.
With any luck, the ASIC technology will cheapen over time to the point where such an emergency pool can be established.

Exchange traded fund. You can buy ETF's on the S&amp;P 500 or spot gold prices, for example. It allows you to index the performance of the entire amount of securities listed on the S&amp;P 500, without actually owning the underlying securities.

Not "impossible" to do anything in the jurisdiction where they were earned, but perhaps the NPV is higher in the US if they can repatriate without triggering the tax, or at a lower rate, say 15% instead of 35%.
It would be a repatriated asset if it could be proven that the investment in Bitcoin was originated in a foreign country using foreign earned funds. I think from a legal standpoint, any public company would be prohibited from doing this due to public accounting implications, but it could theoretically work for a private company with private financial statements, given the ability to maintain relative anonymity within the bitcoin world.
It could be done rapidly too, using a small amount of bitcoins, a large number of transactions, and a relationship with a counterparty who operates in the USD/Yuan (for example) forex market. They would supply BTC for Yuan, transact Yuan for USD, offer USD for BTC in the States, and then immediately send BTC back to China.

Lots of color options, but all one color for now. I accept bitcoin and give discounts for payment in bitcoin. We can do bulk orders as well, and can do custom designs.

Actually he manages ~5b in the liquid markets division, and he doesn't have any of the fund's money in Bitcoin. Most of Fortress is Private Equity and Credit, managed by other guys.
But I wouldn't be surprised if he bought a few hundred grand for kicks.

I would like to see a short video made about a soccer mom going through the progression of an economic transaction, paying some sort of tax, and following the dollar all the way through to the point where it buys a missile mounted on a drone that kills a child identical to that of the soccer mom.
And bitcoin is the alternative.
Another idea:
Bitcoin branded as the alternative to bailouts, stimulus, monetary debasement, and authoritarian central planning. A currency that actually preserves value and privacy.

Shorting real estate could be done in a few ways. The most accessible way to do it would be using a real estate ETF. Borrow the ETF, sell it into the market at the spot price, and then buy it back at a cheaper price (ideally) in the future. The only problem is most real estate ETF's are diversified across commercial and residential, with exposure in residential limited to around 50%. Which means you wouldn't be tracking residential as precisely as desired.

I'm enrolled and trying to catch up. Finding time as a full-time student, plus studying for the CFA exam in June makes my time and energy limited. But I find it fascinating and it's the first time I've found high level mathematics and probability incredibly relevant.
5/5 would recommend.
@_date: 2013-03-18 03:01:30
Yes, but an ETF would provide several benefits for several parties:
1. A layperson not wanting to deal with purchase/storage of bitcoin, but wants to invest in the technology.
2. A hedge fund not wanting to deal with the risks associated with storing and protecting a large position in Bitcoin.
3. Anyone who wants to invest in Bitcoin but doesn't necessarily want to use it for anything but a store of value.

Doesn't matter if it's a gift. As soon as gains are realized, they are taxable. And now you're talking about tax evasion.
I despise taxes as much as the next guy, but it's highly illegal, and you'll be fined and potentially do jail time if it's a large enough sum. Good luck and have fun.

And it operates off block chain, which makes transactions infinitely more efficient - although does introduce a 3rd party and new point of trust.

Unfortunately it's a new enough technology that there are no futures or options markets readily accessible.
Options, futures, and options on futures would go a long way towards removing uncertainty, hedging losses, and allowing more risk averse market participants.
