Out of all the reasons I can think, "heavy user downtime" would be the last.
The volume was barely ~5BTC a week. 
I also got scammed by them, still have "frozen" 2 BTC .

The reason for expensive shipping is because we only use 2-day priority shipping. First class is having issues lately.

Actually they do accept Bitcoins

Updated all shipping prices to reflect real value ($5.95).

You should try Red Dream, it comes with koolada. Great cool aftertaste, without the menthol flavor.

A good mod + tank should not cost more than $40 at fasttech.com 
Though shipping takes forever (china)
Edit: [Try Nemesis mod]( ($15.89) and [Kayfun Atomizer]( ($15.38). Great, flavorful hits.

Have been using ipv2 for ages now, works like a charm. Mini ipv runs for $50 on fasttech. Atlantis tank clone runs for $13. If you are used to maintaining one, don't settle for less. 
$150 seems a bit pricey, unless you go genuine tank.

PG is a great flavor carrier. I do offer 70% VG juices in case you like chasing clouds.

It's foodvape, you get the flavor - without eating anything.
