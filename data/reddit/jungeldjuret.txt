I know one guy who have been watching the price go from $2 to $1.2k and he somehow lost money lol

If I won 1 million dollar, then I would put about $100k-200k of it in bitcoin, maybe $300k

This is more interesting :D
@_date: 2014-05-05 03:20:06
the reason it will be called bits is because its easier to say then bitcoin
many people will probably call 100 satoshi/1 bit for 1 bitcoin aswell in the future
