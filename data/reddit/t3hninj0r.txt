Yes I did via Bitpay.

Maybe, but they could say "Hey we're really sorry but it's going to take over a month to fulfill your order; you can cancel if you'd like" instead of telling me it will ship "this week" for 6 weeks.

I wouldn't mind that if they were up front about it. But saying 3-5 (or 7-10) business days and then taking 36, while constantly saying "your order is going to ship this week" is not acceptable.
Will be giving Provident Metals a try; thanks for the info. :)

Yes exactly, if I would have paid with CC/Paypal or a bank wire transfer, I would have disputed the transaction after 10-15 business days and been done with the whole mess.

Thanks for the information! I've never had to deal with this shit before so I appreciate the advice.

I'll let you know when this shipment arrives that popped up right after my BBB complaint.

I posted it here because I paid with BTC and Amagi metals has made some strong statements in the past about "only accepting BTC" from 2016 onward.

Same here; never ordering there again. I was willing to be patient but that "Review this item" email sent me over the edge.

Yeah, I would have done a chargeback a month ago if I had the option. When using BTC in the future with a vendor for the first time, I'm going to make sure my transactions are smaller.

My issue is more the lack of communication, not responding to emails, not picking up their phone, etc.
If Amagi Metals said: "We're really sorry but we're backed up and it is going to take appx. 2 months to ship your order; would you like to wait or cancel for a full refund?" I would have zero problems with them.

Read the previous post:

Maybe so, but then they should be upfront about that. Put on their website that orders will take a month and not 3-5 (or 7-10) business days.
They can also be honest when I ask my order status, instead of repeatedly lying and saying it will ship "this week".
@_date: 2015-07-04 10:23:38
I would ask Amagi Metals, I'm not sure. 
My experience with charge backs (I've initiated them before) is that the payment processor will look into the claim and if the claim is valid, cancel the transaction.
I'm not a lawyer but I suppose Amagi Metals could claim that I owe them the difference since the transaction is binding and sue if I refuse to pay.

You can read my experience with Amagi Metals:
[Amagi metals asks me to review a product that they haven't shipped me in 36 business days](
[BTC eCommerce, no chargebacks, and Amagi metals; a bad combination](
I would not recommend buying from them.
@_date: 2015-07-03 16:25:28
You can't cancel with Amagi Metals, you can only "sell back" at your own loss plus a processing fee.

+1 on this. I agree completely. Move the block to 2mb and get some objective data on the impact it makes to users who run bitcoind and the mining pools.

This reddit is no longer an open forum of Bitcoin discussion, so why use it? I don't log onto the internet to regress my personal rights and liberty by a few centuries.
