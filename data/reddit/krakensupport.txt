We're generally responding to new support tickets in less than 24hrs at this time. I suspect your ticket was closed a long time ago, and I apologize on behalf of our team if this happened accidentally. If you're still having an issue please either PM me your old ticket number, or go to this page to start a new ticket:

Our digital currency trading platform serves the entire US market, but funding in fiat currency is only available in a few states. We're committed to legal compliance, and unfortunately most states require money transmitter licenses. These licenses are very expensive, and take a long time acquire. Nevertheless, I believe we're actively pursuing some state licensing already, and our goal is to eventually become licensed in every state.

You'll need to open a support ticket:
@_date: 2014-12-18 14:52:50
Yes, we are under DDOS. We will update when we have further information.

I look more like "ridiculously unphotogenic guy", but with less muscles: 
@_date: 2014-07-03 19:58:35
Nope. You only need to send in your ID selfie once in order to get your account properly verified.
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:11:22
We've expedited your Tier 3 verification so that you can get your funds asap. Your daily limits are now much higher. Our system should remove the hold automatically, but this will take a bit more time.
@_date: 2014-12-18 15:34:36
The site is back up, but let us know if you still have any connection issues. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 14:55:21
The site is down because we are currently under DDOS attack. We are working to resolve and will update you when we have further information. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 00:19:50
The site still has problems in Firefox, but it should work fine on other browsers.
@_date: 2014-03-09 04:16:50
Hi fillimupp, I haven't heard about any technical problems with the site. If you have orders pending, the funds you're intending to withdraw may be reserved. Try cancelling any pending orders, and open a support ticket if the problem is persisting.
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:14:09
I'm very surprised to hear this. Please PM me your support ticket number and I'll make sure you get some resolution asap.

In this case, the funds were frozen as result of your friend depositing over his limit. We did respond to him, and our mistake was in taking too long to process his transaction. We're doing our best to improve our support infrastructure in order to better handle these sorts of situations. It's important to remember that Kraken's tiered system imposes max limits on deposits. While this can be inconvenient, it's the only way to operate legally.
@_date: 2014-03-14 17:38:42
We run an accountable and fully legal exchange with the highest security in the industry. We've also developed a proof-of-reserves audit system on our own volition, which will be rolling out shortly. Your accusations of scamminess are completely baseless, but I'm glad you think we're doing good on the PR side of things!

If you have submitted the appropriate documents for a Tier 3 verification, this will likely release any holds placed on over-limit deposits within a few days.

We've been requiring a higher standard of verification for deposits from certain German banks for a while now. Some German banks are being targeted by fraudulent activity and it's gotten to the point that we have to consider deposits from all German banks as higher risk and therefore as requiring a higher level of diligence on our part. For accounts verified to tier 2, this means that we cannot accept deposits from German banks unless the account is verified to tier 3 and the "ID selfie" is included with the verification documents. The "ID selfie" is a picture of you holding the ID used for tier 3 verification. For accounts verified to tier 3, we are also requiring the ID selfie for deposits from German banks. However, for older tier 3 accounts that have already established a good track record with us going back to at least the end of March 2014, we aren't requiring the ID selfie.
An ID selfie isn't required for tier 4 customers since they already meet a very high standard of verification. 
We understand that many of you find account verification to be invasive and troubling because of all the sensitive information and documents that are collected. We share your concerns and wish there was a better way. We strive to only ask for verification information that's necessary and to protect this information as if it were our own. All client verification information is encrypted and it requires access to multiple, highly secure systems to decrypt it. 
The tier 3 documents are unfortunately not something that can only be supplied by a legit customer. It's entirely possible, though not easy, to forge the tier 3 documents or otherwise obtain them illegitimately. We think that the ID selfie is a reasonable way to require a higher standard that reduces the likelihood of illegitimate documents. Note that for a tier 3 account, the ID selfie doesn't ask you to submit anything that you haven't already submitted - i.e. an image of your ID and a picture of yourself (already on your ID). The ID selfie just asks you to put the two together. Keep in mind that you can always write "for kraken.com" on a piece of paper and hold that along with your ID in the selfie. This can help reduce the possibility that the image could be used for any other purpose if it fell into the wrong hands (but again, we take great precautions against this).

Hi blippetyblop, I responded to you over our support channel late last night. Your transfer appears to be delayed because of a communication problem between the banks. Problems like this generally tend to be resolved within a few weeks, rarely taking a month or longer. A delay such as you're experiencing is totally unacceptable. I know it must be extremely frustrating for you, and I can tell you that it's extremely frustrating for us as well. We've done everything we can to assist our bank with tracking down your transfer, and have yet to see any results. 
We're not avoiding your questions and we haven't lied to you. If you didn't always receive a prompt reply from support, it's because we genuinely didn't have any new information to provide you. As soon as we receive an update of any kind we'll send you an email asap. We're doing everything we can, and we're really sorry you've had this bad experience.
@_date: 2014-05-09 23:41:05
Hi MonhoontheHUD, it's hard for me to say exactly what your issue is based on what you've written in this post. But if you want to PM me your support ticket number I'll take a look and make sure you get a response.
Just to clarify, regular wire transfers take from 2-5 business days, and SEPA transfers (Europe) can take as little as a few hours, or up to 4 days. In this case, you've experienced an extra delay because there was a problem, and it'll be my pleasure to help you get to the bottom of it.
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:12:57
That's correct. I'm here to serve the community, and I work directly with the support team. Feel free to PM me if you have a problem.
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:20:22
Your account was never frozen. It's just a matter of the 5 btc deposit being over your daily limit. There are regulatory reasons why we have these limits. Our interest is in protecting depositors.
@_date: 2014-05-28 16:57:23
Hi guys, there's no problem with our system. Some deposits which may not have been placed on hold in the past are currently being placed on hold due to a tightening of our protocols surrounding the approval of deposits. Once your deposit is released, you should not experience a delay again for the same reason. (If you had two deposits placed on hold, then I suspect it was for two separate reasons.)
We're making a lot of improvements, and moving forward we'll be more efficient than ever at processing deposits.
@_date: 2014-07-04 15:57:22
Fraud prevention is the primary motivation behind these new KYC measures for our German clients.
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:31:18
Not exactly. Please reply to your support ticket if it doesn't clear within 24hrs.
@_date: 2014-03-14 17:32:18
Tier 3 verification should only take a few days. Please PM me your support ticket number and I'll take a look and see what the problem is.

The trade engine will still match and fill any existing orders that can be matched. But if both the site and the API are down, then no new orders can be created. Without new orders coming in, the market will reach a static state pretty quickly. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 16:39:49
There are various reasons why a deposit may be placed on hold. Our support team will be able to assist you further, but it could take a bit more time to receive a response.
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:39:31
Thanks for adding Kraken! Great site! It seems the inclusion of Btc.sx may be giving the wrong impression of the average price of bitcoin. Can you really trade bitcoins there at $280?!
@_date: 2014-03-14 16:50:34
I can confirm that this is happening, and that we're doing something a bit more elaborate than what was initially proposed. Announcements on this will drop asap.
@_date: 2014-03-14 17:29:31
Exactly. The trading engine, the website, and our core staff have been around for awhile. However, our service hasn't even been operational for 6mths.
Speaking personally, I originally thought running a digital currency exchange was a relatively simple concept. In reality, there are A LOT of moving parts in this business. It's a big challenge to keep all of the balls in the air at all times, but we're up to it.
We really appreciate the community support displayed in this thread. My aim is to address as many concerns as I can on reddit, but if you have a specific support concern please use:

Transactions can sometimes be labelled as a regular wire transfer (for which we charge a €5 fee) despite being sent as a SEPA transfer. The reason for this could be a mistake by your bank, or a problem in the transaction data we received. In any case, we'd like to apologize for you being charged this fee when sending a SEPA transfer.
Our customer support team is typically able to respond to all support requests in less than 12 hrs (24 hrs at most), and it would be our pleasure to credit your account with €5 reimbursements if a credit is warranted. Here's a link to our Help Center:

You can create a Kraken account and verify it to any tier without depositing anything. So there is no deposit requirement for MtGox creditors or anyone else. The $2000 is a maximum daily deposit limit at tier 2, not a required or minimum deposit amount. If there is some language on our site that led you to believe a deposit is required, please point it out so we can clarify the language.  
@_date: 2015-04-29 15:53:14
If you have access to your original MtGox password, control the email address associated with your MtGox account, and have a Tier 2 verified Kraken account, then you can add your claim online through Kraken. Log in to your Kraken account and visit the 'MtGox Claims' page for instructions. If you are having any trouble entering your claim through our website, please open a support request here:

You should be able to withdraw USD directly to your Canadian bank account. Keep in mind that your bank will likely convert your funds from USD to CAD automatically at bank conversion rates. We recommend you contact your bank beforehand to check these details so there are no surprises. The transfer should take 3-5 business days. 
Alternatively, you can trade your USD for bitcoin and then trade your bitcoin for CAD on Kraken. This way you can withdraw CAD directly. The transfer should also take 3-5 business days. 
Determining the cheapest method is tricky because it depends on various exchange rates and fees. Check out the relevant fees here:

Yes, for residents of Mexico, [Kraken]( offers USD (but no EUR) funding. So you can deposit USD and trade them for bitcoins if you reside in Mexico.

We are working with StefanKBitcoin through our support channel to resolve the issue.

We would like to clarify that the fee for a SEPA withdrawal is only €0.09. We recommend SEPA transfers for residents of SEPA zone countries. The fee for a regular non-SEPA bank wire is €5 within the SEPA zone, the US, or Canada. Euro wire transfers sent anywhere else are subject to a €40 fee since this is exactly the amount we get charged by our bank. Apologies for any confusion.
