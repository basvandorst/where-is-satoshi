Very helpful, especially the step about rebalancing the channel. 
@_date: 2019-07-02 19:42:01
I agree. I think this problem is so severe that banks will not disappear. Instead of securing fiat money they will secure Bitcoins (using an insurance against theft).
If you let them lend out your bitcoins, this service will possibly be free, otherwise you will have to pay a storage fee/insurance fee.
The great thing about this is that we get more choice and freedom. You can store it however you want, you can audit it, you know the inflation rate, and if you don't trust the government/banks you can secure it relatively easily all by yourself.
This choice and freedom alone will force governments and banks to behave better, because they have a little less power over the people.
@_date: 2019-07-20 05:09:35
No. This is not safe. The only safe thing there is that your bitcoins will be gone at some point in time.

1. The paid, funded,... Status should be in a bar on the top. That way I can see that the previous steps were completed and how many steps remain.
2. Please show the link to a block explorer of the funding transaction
3. Please allow a manual transaction fee setting for outgoing transactions
4. Include the video links in the app.
5. What are these badges? Do you not take a transaction fee?
6. The payment note should not be customizizable. Otherwise people start writing bitcoin in there
It looks great so far. Great work

It sounds interesting. Basically multisig, but you safe blockspace because in the end there is only one signature , right? 
Do all signers have to communicate with each other simultaneously?
@_date: 2019-08-25 12:20:41
Thanks for the source code. I think your app will be more successful than bisq because
1. You don't need to already own crypto to start
2. It is simpler
3. I can see this as a way of getting and selling crypto where trading crypto is banned. For this you need to ensure that as little data as possible is stored on the server.

I really appreciate all the work. But as a new user I miss a 3min video explaining how a typical "I want to buy bitcoin" process works. How does the escrow works and what are the fees?
Even after reading your FAQs I still am not sure how this works.

Better use hodlhodl.com
@_date: 2019-10-10 04:53:38
Thanks for the quick answer.    I am still not totally convinced, but I'll think about it some more.
2. I think of a situation that you receive a transaction of 10 000 sat. But because the fees are high and OP\_SECURETHEBAG was used you actually have to include the 2. part of the receving transaction yourself costing, e.g.,  5000 BTC. And then you also want to spend it in a simple transaction costing, e.g., 1000 sat.  That means that you effectively increased the BTC dust limit from 1000  sat to 6000 sat.
3. How does OP\_SECURETHEBAG make opening Lightning channels easier?

I see that, if used as intended, would keep bitcoin more functional in congested times. 
However I am a bit worried about this opcode : 
1. It shifts the burden of the transaction fee more to the recipient. But usually that is what businesses should price in to guarantee a pleasant withdrawal experience . Already now exchanges ridiculously overcharge on btc withdrawal fees. 
2. Could it create a whole bunch of transactions trees that miss the actual output transaction forever due to high fees? Will this create a second class bitcoin = a bitcoin that can only be redeemed when a very high  transaction fee is included to make CPFP work?  I. E. This will also create a new form of dust. And I am already worrying about the normal dust.
3. It could be an incentive for exchanges to delay adopting lightning.
@_date: 2012-07-08 11:51:06
Yes I think so too. Blockchain has done an amazing job with everything!!! , however I think they should keep their hands off "mixing bitcoins".

Yeah. 2 words is not so much. Loop through all of them. You can use bitcoinlib to generate from this wallets and keys. From the keys generate public addresses and compare with the addresses you know are yours.
Depending on your skills 1 to 3 days coding. I have recently programmed with bitcoinlib and it works great.

I think the Number "$1,297 per hour" is the only one significant. I think it costs the current financial institutes similar amounts. And when Bitcoins is widely accepted then the transactions per block will go up, and the cost per transaction will go down.

Everyone can decide what chain he thinks is legit, and very fast it will accumulate and the other chain will be worthless. -&gt; The complete attack worthless. Noone uses that much money and time to disrupt the network for an hour and then have nothing afterwards. Legitimate mining is much more profitable.

I think, everyone shouldn't try to make his own client. If you have time and the knowledge then please make the default client more secure (for example a encrypted wallet...).
Because I and anyone concerned with security won't trust any client, that isn't heavily supported. And for now, only the default client from bitcoin.org is.

bitcoins could still be passed from hand to hand by telling someone the private key (and promising, that I destroy mine). But it would be incredible inconvenient (just like passing goldbars, nothing very easy). And it would be back up as soon as the internet would be back.

A block is a set of transactions. This Block has to have a header, which has to have a special hashsum. This Hashsum is "guessed" (by trial and error) by miners. Once the correct hashsum is found, the block is distributed and the Transactions in that block get their first confirmation. 
Currently, the mining is rewarded by 50 btc per block. That will eventually go down to 0 BTC, and the only reason for mining will then be the transactions fees.
And so "mining" creates Bitcoins in the first place and makes transactions possible.
@_date: 2011-09-06 17:13:47
well I think the key point is that one miner can control if it is profitable or not. But there will always be fluctuations like in a normal stock market (the stock is here "mining" (simplified but true)). That's the reason noone will be able to do what you proposed.
And even if someone would have &gt;50% and would be able to create some blocks before the others. The legitimate network wouldn't accept this chain and would mine their own chain, what makes this complete attack worthless.  
@_date: 2011-08-10 06:53:25
;-) lucky you.
@_date: 2011-10-22 06:49:01

@_date: 2011-07-17 07:02:34
that is a problem we all face. In version 0.4 of the BTC Client the private keys will be encrypted and will make a truecrypt volume unnecessary. But for now we have to trust, that our computer is clean while the truecrypt volume is mounted. You could start a live cd and mount the truecrypt volume from there, but thats a little inconvenient, but way more secure.
@_date: 2011-07-29 16:10:48
No I don't think you bribed anyone. And if fraud really didn't happen to you, and you don't have any loss. Then thats really good for everyone. 
But I believe that money was stolen from Tradehill, and I find it hard to believe that no such fraud has happend to you. Since any half intelligent criminal would maximize his winnings by using the same method on multiple exchanges.
@_date: 2011-07-12 19:18:37

@_date: 2011-09-06 17:27:47
In fact any group (it doesn't matter how much calculation power) does mine their own chain, and people don't accept it (because it violates the rules), the chain and the containing bitcoins are worthless. 
And so only the people agreeing to the same rules give the bitcoins value. The best rules for everybody succeed. (A real democratic currency). 
Everyone can decide them themselfes if they accept this currency with these rules or not. And since it is convenient to have one major currency, one will succeed. And bitcoin is the first and until now most successful democratic currency. (There are others like bitcoin, but noone uses them)
