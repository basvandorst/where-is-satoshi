The best way to invest in Bitcoin is to get some bitcoins and then make a product or service that assists the currency.
@_date: 2019-03-30 21:05:12
I like them!
@_date: 2019-04-06 20:08:16
Why is it unfortunate that Bitcoin is not used for war etc.
I will agree that some of these ‘illicit’ activities aren’t just. And yes, I have bought drugs off of Dream Market. But, it’s not about my opinion or yours, it’s about he majority opinion, unfortunately.

You don’t carry them as they’re worth nothing if your economy collapses.

I’m sure the good people of Reddit can (hopefully) send you a HDD out with a mostly updated block height on it. Maybe
@_date: 2019-04-03 19:25:51
Very much so!
@_date: 2019-04-23 06:30:13
Never said they would.

If someone told me this 20 years ago....

Can you do deposits with PayPal?

Can I PayPal deposit?

Some people memorise their keys and don’t tell anyone hey have any btc.
@_date: 2019-04-06 20:30:13
They probably wouldn’t have money, because of no tax. This means no police, no army, not a lot but anarchy.
@_date: 2019-04-22 20:10:35
I feel like, if our society collapsed, you’d be robbed, you’d try and buy some fuel for gold and they’d tell you to fuck off.
@_date: 2019-04-11 21:14:29
Can you trade USD for crypto?
@_date: 2019-04-06 20:25:45
In this case, the country would probably break down. If there was no tax.
@_date: 2019-04-06 20:00:54
Great, if this is ever implemented. However, as my argument does not refer to the future, neither should the counter.
@_date: 2019-04-22 20:06:19
Why would gold be worth anything realistically? Or do you mean you could trade it to other countries?
@_date: 2019-04-08 18:35:26
I personally bought that Sweatcoin could have done a good job with educating kids on crypto if it had got its act together.

I support Bitcoin. However, this is incorrect information. the cost (to the environment) of running an ASIC or GPU mining is still greater. Also, fraud occurs with Bitcoin and so do huge amount of dark net activities. 
To this, you will probably reply that Fiat is also used for illicit activities. Yes, but this strengthens me pointing out that fraud also occurs with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-03 17:17:41
Nah, very variable. For example, last month I only purchased $180 worth of BTC. One month I bought $1200. Once I bought $5
@_date: 2019-04-03 17:01:04
I buy every month and have done since April 2017. So, technically I did buy at $20K but I personally do t like to buy large amounts when BTC is over $4500
@_date: 2019-04-06 19:36:10
Does fraud cause pollution?
Edit: No
@_date: 2019-04-06 20:17:30
This really doesn’t make sense. Sorry but it’s just rubbish.
@_date: 2019-04-22 20:16:10
Society did not collapse, this is when innovation was at its highest.
@_date: 2019-04-09 20:16:10
It’s great
@_date: 2019-04-06 20:19:40
Just because a YouTube video says this, does not make it correct. If Bitcoin was being used to fund a war, the value of BTC would likely increase. If they demand $1 billion dollars equivalent of Bitcoin. Someone will supply it. 
@_date: 2019-04-06 20:30:38
They couldn’t force the citizens to pay tax for anything.
@_date: 2019-04-06 20:28:54
I don’t disagree with everything you are saying, but, the US couldn’t power itself with renewable energy, never mind itself and say Africa. The U.K., has hundreds of solar farms and still can’t power itself. At current, Bitcoin is a dirty currency. But the concept is great.
@_date: 2019-04-06 20:22:43
I never said they could ‘print’ money
@_date: 2019-04-06 19:26:24
I will probably get downvoted, but, you cannot lie and say that bitcoin is ‘green’. It uses huge amounts of electricity and causes noise and heat pollution.
