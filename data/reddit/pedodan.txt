I don't really understand it. Exchanges will be subject to the tax on the commissions they receive, but are shops subject to it? I don't see any line in the report that accounts for this.

Yes I've noticed this behaviour on FYB-SG quite a few times. It's pretty nice when it happens although I'm mainly holding BTC instead of trading it. There were ASICs shipped here?
@_date: 2014-01-12 15:00:00
If they convert it to SGD immediately though, they might lose a little due to commission from the exchanges. That might be a bit cumbersome for them to handle.

Heh sucks to be him. I only managed to mine on a graphics card for a few weeks and didn't earn much back in April. I've just been making small amounts here and there selling things on Reddit and looking into other cryptocoins.
@_date: 2014-01-12 14:56:20
Ah, didn't understand it at first. I guess it'll just be the same prices at cafes and other shops.
@_date: 2013-06-15 16:32:54
By escrow, do you mean chargebacks in the context of Paypal? Otherwise how does it "hold" the money?
@_date: 2013-07-15 12:25:43
Is this affiliated with FYB-SG?
@_date: 2013-04-25 00:08:11
Recruiting for?
@_date: 2013-06-09 16:14:52
Sucks though, the ask price isn't even moving. I can't take advantage of the cheap bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-07-17 08:44:55
What sort of things?
@_date: 2013-05-28 10:01:08
More merchants begin to accept it as payment and also when it is easier for people worldwide to exchange fiat into BTC.
@_date: 2013-06-09 16:20:26
This is in Singapore dollars. And there is generally a markup on the bid/ask prices probably because of the wire fees required for bank transfers to Mt. Gox.

I'd probably try to tip in other subreddits to spread the word of Bitcoin. I'd also keep a balance on a local exchange for selling and buying. 
@_date: 2013-05-30 07:13:39
Merchants usually don't receive money immediately from credit card companies either. But with Bitcoin the transactions take much lesser time to clear depending on the fees you added to your transaction for the miners. (These fees are pretty much a drop in the ocean if you are not doing microtransactions.)

I'm sure the other email is anon's personal one, there is no way in hell that he managed to find the botnet owner's emails. The email that the admin put out is different from everything else that anon tried.
@_date: 2013-05-30 10:06:25
Just trying to help. But as far as I can see from the screenshots, you just need to join a mining pool and input the details into the application for it to start working.
@_date: 2013-05-30 09:10:35
I don't think an android phone is powerful enough to mine for bitcoins at the current difficulty. You'd probably also damage the phone with the heat that it would generate. You would be much better off buying bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-06-10 06:15:32
I should've worded that a little better, I meant the people utilising the exchange. Sorry for the confusion.
@_date: 2013-06-15 17:23:26
Oh that wasn't what I was trying to get at, but a good point nonetheless.  You can revert Bitcoin transactions? I thought that was impossible.
@_date: 2013-04-24 23:28:37
Now now, let's tone it down a little.
@_date: 2013-06-15 15:57:54
Yes you're right, but isn't Bitcoin more feasible for stores and markets? With Paypal, you have to pay fees to withdraw/send (even then sending money without fees is not available in many places) and you also risk getting your funds frozen indefinitely.
@_date: 2013-05-30 09:45:06
It's not worth it. I doubt it'd be profitable in any way and you'd do long term damage to the device which probably does not have very good cooling.
@_date: 2013-06-10 06:17:20
At least the authorities don't seem to have a problem with Bitcoin.. at least for now. You got that last point spot on, haha.

It's a nice little amount, though I think $2 would be better? Then we could try things like satoshidice, which requires a little over 0.01 to play. I've been sporadically mining though, I made 0.01+ and I'm planning to buy some Bitcoin very soon.
@_date: 2013-06-09 18:03:29
How did he get the email and ID though? 
EDIT: Oh I figured it out. The genius made another email address with the guy's username. This is rather troubling though, how could he just give out a person's email like that? Although no one else might've known the username..
@_date: 2013-04-25 02:09:04
That's pretty smart actually. I think it's a very real possibility if Bitcoin becomes really popular that the US would actively want to suppress it.
I agree, 0.1BTC has more use, it's a much greater incentive for people to support the currency. Very nice of you to do this, btw! I will tip once I get more!
@_date: 2013-06-09 21:42:27
I agree but it's useful for buying virtual stuff in the interim.  I could see small restaurants and coffee joints (read: Starbucks or just one of the many other establishments) taking in Bitcoin sometime in the future, not too hot on how hawker centres may react to it though. Perhaps when the newer generation of Singaporeans take over hawker centres, they may start to see the viability of using Bitcoin as a mode of payment. 
Or Kopitiam could take the initiative and start to establish Bitcoin payment systems, as far as I recall they do have their own "Kopitiam card" where you can store money and pay for your meals. I don't see why Bitcoin couldn't be used in the same vein.
FYBSG irritates me sometimes though, I can stand the prices being a little higher than that at Gox but it takes a while to respond to price changes because of the few buyers. I estimate that there are less than a thousand users on the exchange.
@_date: 2013-06-09 16:20:43
I wonder, why do you say that?
@_date: 2013-06-09 18:11:15
See how the process in task manager has the miner's details? The funoriam part was guessed as the guy's username so anon just worked his way from there..
@_date: 2013-05-21 03:02:04
Thanks! That's really kind of you! :D
See this is why Bitcoin is so great, you can easily just tip strangers without any fuss. Furthermore, your funds can't be arbitrarily held just like in PayPal.
