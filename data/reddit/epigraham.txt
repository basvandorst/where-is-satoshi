I think your 'problem' is that there is nothing wrong with VoS. It is functioning as usual so the current panic doesn't apply there. Also its a low volume exchange but I think at this moment it's a lesser factor.

So the tulip bubble only lasted for 2 years and never went through a price correction phase. That seems about the same time frame for more recent fads like pogs, beanie babies, and other collectibles. Collectibles don't have limited supply though. Maybe a more interesting comparison would be to a newly discovered gemstone.

    Here is the first column. I may be able to do more tomorrow.
The idea of breaking through borders between the digital world and the physical has permeated science fiction plots for decades. But what if the real world begins, in fact, to become more virtual? It is a feat which, apparently, bitcoin (BTC) has managed to bring forth, even after the turbulent events of these past months, which have put in jeopardy the future of virtual money.
Brasil already has 51 establishments, including bars, inns, restaurants, shops and even a plastic surgery clinic, who, in addition to reais (R$), also accept virtual money. In one month this number almost doubled: in February, according to the CoinMap service, which maps out the places where one can use BTC as payment, the country had 27 spots.
In Latin America, Brasil is not the biggest market. Argentina shows 107 establishments. And, in the whole world, there are already 3.6 thousand according to CoinMap, which represents an increase of 38% compared to February.
According to estimates by the Brazilian "exchange" BitInvest, which intermediates the trade of reais for bitcoins, the domestic market already circulates R$ 20 million per month, in around 400 thousand transactions. "The majority of the transactions are concentrated in the exchanges, but there are also direct dealings between users," states Flavio Prippas, partner in BitInvest, whose curriculum shows having gone through US bank JP Morgan, as director of IT.

Good point. Sure, some people will keep their funds with stock exchanges or lending companies in order to produce a return, but unlike today it won't be a necessity to defend their purchasing power. 
Fractional reserve lending will still exist but I imagine the reserve capital needed to remain solvent will be higher than it is now. That means a lower multiplier effect, which along with interest rates set by the market will make the business cycle much milder and shorter than today's insanity.

Many large currencies use $, and there is more than one major ¥. They seem to be getting by in spite of the confusion. One way to distinguish is T฿ and X฿.

Russia and China have pretty major central banks who are big buyers of gold this year. Turkey too. Most of the western central banks may have "leased" a large part of their gold away in order to drop the price and make fiat money look more credible (USA) or sold it off (UK).

So bitcoins can be lost if you don't pay a transaction fee? That doesn't make sense to me. Last week I had a transaction take 2 days to confirm. If there was a chance it was lost I should have been panicking.

Indeed. I spent 2005-2006 in Limassol and often visited the north. Its not a solution by itself but every little bit helps. My main question is whether you are legally permitted to deal with entities in northern Cyprus. For example can you accept other currencies for bitcoin, including Turkish lira? Or, if a business in northern Nicosia wants to accept payments via Bee, can you do that?

The best short-term ROI might be in the latest scamcoin but its also a good way to lose everything. Got to spread the risk.
If you like alternative currencies, put at least 10% into physical (not paper) precious metal coins. Another 5-10% could be play money for altcryptos if you want to dive in there. And most of the rest into bitcoin, assuming you are okay with the risk.

Marc Emery is a Canadian who did no business inside the USA but mailed marijuana seeds to US customers. He has been in a US jail for the past several years. The DEA targetted him because he is political (used proceeds to advocate for legalization), but if bitcoin became political it could lead to the same. Also it takes several years or heaps of money to get a new citizenship.

TL;DR Contrary to what the media says, bitcoins are not anonymous, in fact their traceability can be very advantageous for law enforcement. Silk road patrons are in trouble [aside: a vendor was indeed arrested yesterday]. The author surmises that governments are biding their time allowing bitcoin to grow before unleashing the tax authorities on bitcoin business to get at their customers. This could cause bitcoin to become worthless.
The author says that if an encrypted wallet is seized, then nobody can use the contents [nevermind hiding a backup]. Otherwise pretty accurate considering the intended audience.
