The app for payment is only available in chinese. Even chinese people don't like china.. if you like it so much why not move there and be the communist party's bitch..

Yes, work smart and be a millionaire or whatever it is you want to be. OP here is selling a pipe  dream about your grandkids being millionarires and you being some wise old guy who made that happen.. well guess what.. he's just a dude wanting you to buy his coins while its at its peak.. like I said before, the entire BTC price and where is goes is tightly controlled by the whales.. they're the ones profiting off of this.. they make it go one way and the other making money all the time.. the sheeple just go along for the ride.. It has become a mockery of what  Satoshi envisioned. Cant even send a transaction for low fees these days; abominable fees and wait times.. whales doing their dance and sheeples willing to believe anything to make a quick buck without any work..

Thank you. My transaction was stuck due to low fees which the wallet said was totally okay. First time this happened to me its very frustrating having to wait 3 days to resend the money.. Pfft!

Went through after 6 hrs.
@_date: 2017-05-11 11:24:30
Is there any way to cancel the transaction though? Does it auto-cancel after 3 days?

Kraken used to be real deal.. now they've gone over to the dark side.

Should be relatively easy if you can get a local lawyer and settle this in civil court

This is not a good time to get in on the game..
