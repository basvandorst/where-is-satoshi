Do anyone know what site is best for buying bitcoins in Norway?
I have been recommended Localbitcoins.com. 
Coinbase have alot of fees. I have also been thinking about gdax.

I see. What do you think of this method. Formating my usb. Installing ubuntu on the usb. Transfer bitadress on a second usb. Disconnect from the web and boot up ubuntu from my usb. Put in the secondary usb in and transfer over bitadress and then create a wallet with encryption. I don't have a printer so i would have to write down the import key or take a picture with my old digital camera that is not connected to anything. I guess just writing it down is safer.
What do you think? :)

So i should do this then. Format my usb stick, install ununtu on it and drag the bitadress.org into the usb. Go offline and boot up ubuntu and create the wallet? :)

I don't have a printer. I would just write it down in a piece of paper and laminate it.

Nice! That sounds alot safer. How do i do this? I have a usb stick i could clear. Do you have any instructions to how i would do this?

So, would this be safe?
1: Format usb and install ubuntu on it.
2: Download bitadress.org and drag into usb stick.
3: Disconnect the internet and boot up ubuntu
4: Create wallet 
5: Profit??

Thank you!
So i could download Electrum, go offline and install it to my usb and it would be safe if i never connect it online anymore?
What if the usb stick gets defect? Is there a impoet key i can write down from Electum?
Sorry for dumb questions im trying to learn before i do anything :)

What about paper wallets? 
I used a fresh usb and installed ubuntu and put bitadress on it. Disconnected from the web and booted up ubuntu and made a wallet with encryption.
I would think this is 99% safe?

Thank you! Stay ethical my friend.

How? The usb was destroyed right after i used it and it was never connected to the internet.
The thing that scares me is when i want to get the bitcoins out of the wallet. Blockchain.com is a safe method for retrieving the coins right?
I have been thinking if getting a hardware wallet so i can store my btc and ltc. Currently my ltc is stored on gdax and that scares me...
