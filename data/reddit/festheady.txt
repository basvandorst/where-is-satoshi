@_date: 2014-03-21 18:52:51

Or to the moon, through a hole dug to china!
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:22:45
I just thought it was based on bitstamp price and that it would always be ~2-3$ difference. wont be using  as much now
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:27:00
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:05:34
you dont, they do not offer that option that I know of. Coinbase is not an exchange. I think there might be an android app that will set buys and sells for coinbase, but I have crapple, so I wouldnt know anything about it.

Did any one catch the name on the keycard, with his cat and keyboard pic? 
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:20:37

@_date: 2014-02-25 06:53:36
dont know, is there a return2fiat.com...... it dropped a bit since posting but still impressive, no lets see what Europe has in store, looks like about morning there?
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:21:21
Each trade results in a Bitcoin being sent from the currency counter in red to the country on the map. The value in BTC is listed in green and plotted across the map. The last exchange rate for each currency is listed in  and updated for each trade.
Thats all I got.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:21:22
Thanks for the helpful reply, I bought a bit in the 525-500 range, was gonna buy a bit here and there. Looks like im not sleeping tonight.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:05:13
i agree
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:54:20
 I'm just saying, not everyone that holds bitcoin is stuck to a computer 24.7. When these guys get there Wheaties and morning big name news, and get the report that gox is dead, wont there be a sell off, or are there not enough of those kind of people. Sorry for the run on sentence.
@_date: 2014-02-26 05:21:43

Did any one catch the name on the keycard, with his cat and keyboard pic? 
@_date: 2014-03-21 17:53:29
Thanks I tried emailing them, been about 3 days since then. I guess I didnt see the phone number Ill call that now and see what happens. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:20:19
Check back asap!
@_date: 2013-12-14 07:51:30
Are all exchanges independent? Do you see a time where there is only one exchange? Or maybe just the opposite, lots of exchanges?
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:42:12
well I did it twice when i was gonna buy but it gave me option to cancel. Its my fault 
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:53:45
how do i set triggers on bitcoinium.com? cant find anything but a graph
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:47:55
I was half asleep, I wasnt going to sell fucking shit. just hit the wrong button. Im an idiot and your probably right. My confidence is gone after this, i feel ashamed, and really horrible. Its my kids birthday and I cant even be happy. All Im doing is going between being angry and breaking down and crying. It wasnt all that much but I lost more than half and I didnt lose it all, but the fact that it just gone, at a lose is killing me.
@_date: 2013-12-14 07:52:49
is there a minimum amount needed to do arbitrage? I heard where you need to leave quite a bit in both exchanges due to time issues.
@_date: 2013-12-13 14:13:04
ahh i got ya
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:29:57
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:19:51
i agree
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:52:30


I have iphone, fuck apple too
 Im going to try bitcoinium
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:08:50
Does anyone know if  works well for notifications?
@_date: 2013-12-14 07:59:29
wouldn't that lower the value of them if it takes months to get my cash, or does it add value because people cant easily exit the market there for making it more stable?
@_date: 2013-12-14 06:37:36
$50-70 gap Im new but that seems like a lot
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:55:10
yes i was panicking, but I ment to cancel after I found out how much coinbase was payihg out. I always go to the next screen, because soemtimes the value changes. hit confirm instead of cancel. cant believe it. I hope it gets below 400
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:44:40
I hope that happens
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:30:36
At your convenience.

Since when did China become libertarian?
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:17:43
Thanks id appreciate that.
@_date: 2013-12-13 14:02:52
it never got to 950 on coinbase/bitstamp. can you tell me how you did it, thats about what i was looking for to cash out a couple...thanks
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:45:37

@_date: 2013-12-18 14:43:17
