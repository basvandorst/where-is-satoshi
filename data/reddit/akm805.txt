I don’t know about being the “safest” but it does have a lot of safety features. I will say there is a bit of a learning curve when it comes to the cold card and it might not be the most user friendly wallets but if you are willing to put in the time it’s worth checking out.

I don’t even understand what you’re trying to say. You need a license from the FCC to operate a ham radio, you don’t need a licenses to use bitcoin but that’s not the point. 
No one person, country or entity controls bitcoin. Your understanding of ham radio and bitcoin seem to be about the same. 
It seems your question isn’t to actually get any new information or to have a conversation but rather to state your point of view which is fine but if you don’t like bitcoin don’t buy it or use it. 
There are plenty of other options.

Maybe you opened the wrong wallet on your ledger. 
You should have a legacy and a segwit option. 
Good luck.

Because bitcoin is decentralized. That’s the whole point.

Just tried out Quickcoin and so far so good. 
Great job.

Crazy. 
I guess I’ll just wait it out.

I have the “?” Mark thing as well but no error message. I have no idea if it’s normal or not but I have been at this point for at least 2 weeks.

They also used the internet. I guess you better stop using that as well.

You could get a Coldcard then use Blockchain wallet app or any other app that lets you import watch only address.
