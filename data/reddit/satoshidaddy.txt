I agreed with the article concerns. It happened to me that I registered with MT-GOX in the end of 2013, and I noticed something is terribly wrong with this company, then I stopped using them. Lucky me that I didn't buy any bitcoins using MT-GOX.
Today, I registered with Coinbase.com. Even thought Coinbase is backed by Marc Andreessen. You need to be worried if you invest your money with exchange providers, why? Because most exchange providers only gave you the numbers of bitcoins that you own without such evidence that you own such many Bitcoins.
So to prove yourself that you own these bitcoins, then you MUST transfer your bitcoins to external wallet such as Blockchain.info wallet. But not all exchange users will do that. So there is lots of risks and potential problems like GOX, that they can just walk away with your invested money!
Independent auditing is one part, and more importantly we need something like FDIC or insurance behind such exchange providers.

This BTC address is very active and has 175 transactions with currently 17.9 BTC on the balance.
Total Received	114.56401928 BTC	
Can you provide the stolen Bitcoin address for further investigation please. Can you check the link above and identify the address and date / time please.
Note! I am not asking for your blockchain.info wallet login identifier but the address that was holding the stolen 5.3 BTC.
For security reason, please use blockchain.info 2FA, with different password for sending out BTC. So in this way, you can check balance, and you will be required to use different password for sending BTC out from your blockchain account.
I have registered a domain name SatoshiDaddy.com website for this type of lost BTC investigating and reporting as well as phishing sites.
I am in the process to create some procedure and tools that can help to identify such as location and following the trails of the stolen BTC movements. You can email me @

Also please note!
For checking your blockchain.info balance, you might just want to your Bitcoin address without actually login to your wallet.
This is a safe way!

If some people out there reported lost BTC, then it matters.

Are these 1853 BTC stolen bitcoins? That's why they need to keep moving from address to address? If so, then there is a system doing this moving job. Then the question is who own these 1853 BTC ?

I don't have a clear plan yet, still working on my plans. But my first plan is to develop a procedure with a program to auto keep track of the lost bitcoins.
