is it very hard to buy + sell bitcoins? I HAVE NEVER ATTEMPTED TO BUY OR SELL. Can you guys enlighten me on how hard is it to sell coins for a profit? Im a 15 year old teenager and money doesn't come easy and i was thinking about flipping coins on the market, obviously this isn't easy to do because if it was everyone would be doing it.
Edit: Couldn't i take advantage of the $100 price jumps on bitcoins to make a profit? Based on the charts the prices of bitcoins almost always stays around a $500 gap and jumps up or down. ( I might be ignorant in saying this but im new to all this, if i am being ignorant sorry)

im 15 years old, and i wanted to validate my theory.

YES, that is a great opinion and i also believe in that based on the past statistics from bitcoin graphs. Do you know any exchanges that have very low fee's? I some convinced my mom to buy some bitcoins and she offered to buy $500, we aren't the richest of people and fee's are a big concern to me. I am have this problem where i need everything to be in the most optimal setup possible. AGAIN THANKS FOR ALL THE HELP MAN

How does the ledger nano s work exactly? I did a quick google search and im gonna read it up some more. I would like to know what you think about it and its function from your perspective. Also I like the idea that you started off by buying $100 worth of ETH/BTC every week, i might do something like that but prob with like $10-30 a week. 
EDIT: i just watched a video of how the ledger nano s functions. THX FOR INFOMATION MAN.

Idiots that want to buy and hope, instead of actually making a bigger profit.
