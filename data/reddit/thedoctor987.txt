Its too bad that there is no way to speed up coinbase transactions.  As for bitinstant it has been well over a month since I used it and with the number of people that are having issues I wouldn't use it currently.  
Out of curiosity how many BTC do you need for the event this weekend?

I used bitinstant before as well and had no issues.  used a moneygram at a cvs paid out to a mtgox account.  One thing I am curious about for those of you that are having issues where did you have it set to pay out to?

its not a service they openly offer.  you have to email them and offer it.

Not only that if you are able to manage your money well there is no reason to pay any fees or interest using banks or credit cards in fact by using credit cards you earn free money via various rewards which over the course of a year add up.  (tho never get a card with citi bank they are a terrible credit card company)

If they were on a formatted hd you are sol.  I went through this back in april when bitcoin was widely talked about.  Back in 2010 i mined 5$ worth of btc at 0.10$ to the bitcoin deemed it to be a waste of time and forgot about it. i spent a while trying to recover them but 2 formats later there was very little chance.

I just got my wire transfer from mtgox.  ~2000 which I was told 10 days back on 8/22 when I contacted them right away for an estimate.  I contacted Mtgox several times asking what the status was and they gave me various excuses basically saying they are backlogged.  After seeing posts on here I emailed them on 9/24 saying I authorize them to take 5% if the process my withdraw immediately.  Sure enough I got en email back the next day saying that my wire would be sent the following day 9/27.  This net slightly more then having canceled and withdrawn to coinbase but for those of you who have transfers pending it might be easier.
