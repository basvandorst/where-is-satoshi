The grass is always greener. What if we had gotten into bitcoin when it was $.05? Well, I probably would've ended up selling at like $8 anyways, then I'd STILL be playing this "what if?" game. You played it how you played it, and I bet you ended up making money. Be happy we're in this early!

This just in: most of people’s money that are stored in banks STAY in banks! People are barely even using the dollar! /s

What are you talking about? That’s not how ASIC resistance works. 0 coordination is required and it doesn’t centralize anything.

Anyone can make a bitcoin clone. The question is, why use the clone over the original? What new value proposition does it bring to the table? Will it have enough adoption to matter?

Reddit. Google “crypto multireddit”. You can make a copy of it for your account.

If its the correct path for bitcoin, won't the market dictate it so? Why does bitcoin need to be gamed for bitcoin cash to even stand a chance?

I LOVE it! Thank you for your work. Do you have any upcoming features you'd like to tell us about? It does what I need, I'm just curious about your plans.

Small suggestion: red/green text for the 24change stat.
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:00:04
as someone from the future, thank you.

But you kept the buy button. Hodl me.

As a newcomer, whats happening here? Bitcoin being gamed?
@_date: 2017-08-28 03:47:39
Not sure what you mean, I live in MN and had no issue purchasing BTC/LTC

Oh oh, my Satoshi

Oh oh, my Satoshi

God yes... imagine how inexpensive it is for an attacker to spin up 1100 nodes. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:27:10
Lol! I think a better counter argument against the big blocks is: when blocks are full at 8mb, what then? Bigger blocks? And when those are full? Forking every time blocks get full is NOT a scaling solution. Its moving the goal posts. 
I also cannot understand the offense of “bcash”. If you went up to a stranger on the street who had never heard of bitcoin or crypto and asked them for a nickname for “bitcoin cash”, i’d bet over 80% would come up with “bcash”. Theres no malice implied! The sycophants are so sensitive.
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:29:25
Did u read the article? Bitfury did a study that showed if block sizes increased to 8mb, 85% of nodes would shut down in 6months. There r other, non-fee related consequences to increasing block size
@_date: 2017-11-04 04:02:41
The truth: too much.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:08:27
Just you.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:36:54
U can make your own fork, but its worthless if no one uses it

50 apps pending updates?! The madman
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:14:31
Let me just check my crystal ball here...
If the choices r having low fees on a centralized coin or high fees on a decentralized coin, well, the market has already spoken on that...
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:05:16
One time this guy on reddit tried to gather coinbase horror stories to spread FUD. It was terrifying!
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:09:57
Buy the rumor, sell the news
@_date: 2017-09-11 20:03:15
Fodl?! Heresy!

If? You mean when?
@_date: 2017-09-25 21:44:12
Crypto is decentralized, God has no authority over it!
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:46:28
Is it better to hodl or hodl?
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:04:15
How is it at the expense of HODLers if profit/losses aren’t actualized until you sell?
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:59:57
Get some manners.
@_date: 2017-09-20 15:06:42
Very interesting
@_date: 2017-09-17 14:15:46
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:24:06
Yes, sell low, buy high. /s
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:17:21
I nearly shit myself, this is fucking terrifying!
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:16:01
Strong argument...
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:05:17
How much BTC was recovered?
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:51:48
Doesn’t it seem a little backwards that the NWO would try to gain control by freeing people from the current financial institution and introducing a decentralized one? Keyword decentralized, NWO has no power there.

Apple is already recommending the perfect response above the keyboard, “okay yeah no...”
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:44:24
The question isn’t will it dip at the fork, the question is what will it dip from and to? If bitcoin hits, for example, 8000 before the fork, it could still dip above 5100. I wouldn’t dare tell you what to do with your money but reducing stress/risk is my play
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:29:42
Big if true

Dont have a bad attitude. I have no allegiance to either side. Theres so much misinformation out there, I dont know how you could pick a side. My only point is that a thread like this adds absolutely no value to the discussion. I appreciate you responding with some talking points, though.

People will always be making more than you. Don’t make decisions based on it. Hodling is about reducing risk by trusting future growth.
