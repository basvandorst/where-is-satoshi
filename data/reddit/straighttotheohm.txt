Would people actually buy this shirt? ~~I can design a version and screen print it. Only payable by Bitcoin as well.~~
Found the original maker of the shirt.

"If I would've invested in Bitcoin earlier, this could've been a Lamborghini."
@_date: 2016-08-20 10:51:09
You're right, I assumed that this was just a one-off tee that someone printed but I found the seller. The verbiage isn't so much unique as I've seen it before but here's the shirt on sale here. 
To be honest, the design is ugly as shit. I'd make some adjustments to make it look cleaner.

Yes, 2FA has been in place since it became available. Even though I don't hold any BTC on Coinbase itself, I'm not a fan of being able to withdraw directly from my bank account.
@_date: 2015-12-11 23:06:33
Yes, I do something similar but with a different card.
@_date: 2015-12-11 23:37:56
Although we may be a little jaded since 2FA is quickly becoming an industry standard, hell, I even have 2FA on my water bill account.
BUT, there are still many others that do not utilize security measures. 
Every user should use at least 2FA if it is available.

What? There's both CDMA and GSM iPhones. GSM technology uses sim cards..
@_date: 2015-12-04 17:14:01
Not pure CDMA phones. All iPhones do since they can both utilize a GSM and CDMA network, but quite a bit of CDMA only network phones (Majority in the U.S.) do not has a sim slot.

Must be nice to be a citizen of a country that offers free healthcare then, even then it's not free, people are paying it through tax subsidies. 
Also, you make no sense in saying that Obamacare wasn't the result of higher premiums, yes it is. Granted that Texas is conservative, there's a reason we stayed afloat while everyone else was struggling. Healthcare was fine, there was no reason to fix something that wasn't broken.

Monthly fee based bank accounts from Green-Dot have been around for years well before Bitcoin, the only thing that's changed in this case is branding.
@_date: 2014-09-24 04:27:30
I use a Green-Dot branded card for Coinbase so I can buy the MoneyPaks to put into my GreenDot Account for Bitcoin purchases through CB, I've transferred both deposits and withdraws.
Not sure if these particular cards through Walmart will be different but for less features I don't see the point of them.

It can go both ways. There's a huge generation gap between homeless and although they may be homeless, it doesn't mean they still don't carry cell phones, laptops and other electronic equipment.

Are you looking to work with a single designer or crowdsource it? 
If you're looking for a single designer, let me know the details of the project and I will consult with you to see if we're a good fit.

Yah it's something like $10 a month. It's more like a retail bank but doesn't offer the same benefits as a traditional bank such as loans, small business stuff, etc..

Ah, Yah sorry for dropping the ball. It was late when I posted and I was busy running around all day. Thanks for the update!

He's bitching about banks not accepting **paper** money into someone else's account, yet then he goes to say; 
*'It’s 2014, are we really still using pieces of paper?'*

Yup, for an asthma specific plan through the marketplace it would cost me $625/month when I was paying $230 with the same private insurance. Now it's cheaper to pay the dr out of pocket and order all my meds from Canada and just pay the penalty at the end of the year. I just hope I don't have a severe attack to warrant an ER visit of $2500 or more.
Fuck Obama and his dry long dicking to the younger generation of this country.

If I remember, I think the bank that issues the cards is MetaBank or Bancorp. They give you the routing and account number for ACH deposits as well.

When it comes to bitcoin and traditional credit cards, I'm more in favor of credit cards since they offer more than just protection from fraudulent merchants. Granted, my particular credit card company is  pita when dealing with chargebacks, I still see much more value to building and maintaining my credit, receiving benefits as less expensive flights, and general peace of mind knowing that I have that credit available to me at a low APR.  
Bitcoin is good because it's an asset, essentially internet cash.  This type of transaction, for me, is great for paying suppliers or designers in another country outside of the US.  Being able to use an escrow service awards me peace of mind knowing that if I don't receive my product, then I still have my funds.  
I agree with you, daily transactions are what my credit card is used for, yet bitcoin is used for particular transactions to pay people I don't readily trust with giving my bank or CC info to.  
They are both financial tools with very different applications. I, for one, will never be strictly one type of payment option only. In fact, I never use cards at a gas pump due to skimmers running rampant so I always use cash with gas purchases.  
It really depends on what tool fits the issue you're trying to solve.  
Granted, both bitcoiners and people that are pro traditional transaction instruments likely tend to lean very far into their ideologies of their particular payment method, yet since we're quickly becoming a world transactional market, then being able to diversify my payment options is the reason I use Bitcoin.  
Thank you for providing your thoughts on it unlike that just wants to devolve into calling people names.

Because it's a pain in the ass the majority of the time when I have to call Pajeet in Delhi, give them all of my private info, wait on the call for an hour, then wait for days/weeks to make sure I'm 'within policy" for a chargeback. 
With escrow the buyer knows the money is there and once I receive the item I can check to ensure it is correct, then release funds to the buyer.  Much easier than having to deal with the policy and procedure of my credit card company. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 20:19:24
Escrow happens in every single transaction you already make with a credit card. It's up to the merchant's payment processor to release the funds into the retailer's account.  
You know what else uses escrow, tax payments on your mortgage. That's right, you provide funds to your mortgage company so taxes will be paid on the property.  
Buy anything from eBay? Use Paypal? Guess what? Escrow! 
Escrow isn't some magical instrument that Libertarians invented, it's already a daily part of life for the many adults who make their way through life.  Don't worry You'll get there some day.
@_date: 2016-12-30 19:21:20
Third party escrow.

You have a point, but gauging user interest would be beneficial in making a decision.  I didn't want to accept bitcoin for the sake of promotion which I see run rampant here and other bitcoin oriented avenues.  
I honestly don't see my customer base using it as a regular payment method and the 1-3% that I've transacted with in bitcoin have been less than stellar to work with.  Nothing against the monetary transaction, it went smooth.  
Thanks for your reasonable perspective.
@_date: 2016-09-17 05:01:00
I completely agree with you on not expecting much additional income, I do have less than a handful of customers that pay in BTC, yet I don't want to come off as gimmicky, you know?
I think in the meantime I'll stick with just sending an invoice payable in bitcoin if my clients ask.
