If you view history this might be like 2014.   We went down 85% ... which means $3000 or so. 
But we sat still all 2015 
Then tripled on 2016 
You know the 20x story of 2017.
I can wait until 2021 ... can anyone else?

Very few people were making trades for this small.  And it was difficult to get anyone to trade.  
Late 2012 // Early 2013 was about the time you could actually buy and sell and it still wasn't easy.  
But once it was easier we spiked to $1000 then crashed to $180.

1st ... I didn't say it vindicates Ross.  But to not allow the defense this right to explain this to the jury is wrong.  To not explain the possibility that the prosecution's main investigators had alternate motives seems like a massive piece of information.   Especially considering the amount of police abuse in the United States.  
2nd .... you're seriously hung up on race.  Like a lot of Americans you can't see past race and it's sad.  Americans are just so obsessed with race.  One thing I've learned from moving from USA to Central America is how much better race is dealt with in a lot of ways.  
You make it sound like you probably think if someone picks white socks instead of black in the morning they're racists.  I mean ignoring all facts of why someone supports Ross and consistantly reverting back to race.  
As far as president.... we've never had someone setup a decentralized network where all you did was create a platform for dealers and buyers to meet.  To immediately say you're the drug lord with no regulation and no laws to address this crime seems far fetched to me, and judges handing down harsh punishments seems politically motivated.  
3rd ... this is personal preference.  But if you're really concerned about the plight of minorities in the United States or elsewhere you're main focus should be on the drug war.
Constantly minorities and non-whites are over prosecuted for the same crimes as whites.   Mainly due to the lack of a decent defense lawyer which is essential in the United States justice system.  But other like you will see it as evidence if a bias racist system.  
Either way, you'd help those people a lot but not being so forceful in your desire to punish the drug war.

**Conservative is good.**
But a proposal from 2014 to double the block size that was thoroughly and totally reviewed by every developer and supported by both developers and the community seems like it fits the conservative definition to me.  
By 2017 doubling the block size was only resisted by a tiny but vocal minority.  
Doubling the block size would give us until 2020 probably to figure this out.  
So while I fully agree with a lot said, I'll never understand how a simple increase in the block size from 1 to 2 *(higher if we include Seqwit)* to get us by while we develop Lightning ever became a major lightning rod.  It split our community (Bitcoin Cash) and has made us name call each other to death. 
We can't put the toothpaste back in but I do miss the days with our small community was unified against the banksters and for liberty, freedom and censorship resistant money that is both a store of value and a means of transaction.

Four comments:
--White was 0% of my original statement.  So 1/3 seemed obsessive to me.  
--Cant believe you feel that the two main investigators are found to be stealing Bitcoin from silk Road instead of investigating the crime to be a non issue at all.  
--The CEO of Bitmex is black.  The founder of Stratis is black. Reason you don't hear about it is because no one on the crypto community cares, including me. 
--I think media loves color and Americans are obsessed with race as I fold you before. Not sure why you'd say I think the media does not see color.

Nor sure what the hell you're talking about 
1st .....The investigators that went after him have been proven to be criminals and are in jail.  And the testimony of those agents and the work of those agents was a part of how Ross got caught AND the judge refused to allow this information into the trial.  
2nd ...The main reason is the sentancing.  For a non violent act he got life.   Many other drug dealers who actually dealt drugs got less than ten years.  Almost all legal experts agree that Ross's sentanced was unprecedented on a massive scale. 
3rd ... while one and two are universal and obvious, the fact that adults cannot conduct business  with other adults in a non violent fashion and purchase drugs rubs many the wrong way including me.   
@_date: 2018-05-25 12:53:38
I disagree we will never surpass 10k.  Public money is a joke IMO compared to institutional funds. 
Granted it's gotten us this far but Bitcoin has a long ways to go. Obviously moving to mBTC would be the best thing we could ever do but they won't seem to do it. 
But what we want is institutional money. Get me the Texas teachers fund, the Milwaukee firefighters, and the Yale endowment.

Take two minutes and do the math to make sure you're getting a coin worth $6000.

You've never seen an argument against single payer that makes sense???   Wow.  You haven't been paying attention.  
To start just look at Canada and United States.  Many Canadians come to the US for health care, which is regarded to be the best in the world.  No one goes to Canada for health care.   
**I'll also share a personal story.**  I live in a central American country that has both public and private healthcare and hospitals.  
It's a totally private system with zero government involvement or government protections. So malpractice doesn't exist for instant.  
I have the best health care anywhere and it's cheap.  My doctor spends at least an hour with me anytime I want.  That's face to face time with the actual doctor.  Not a nurse or helper.  
I have my doctor's and my dentist's and my kid's doctor's personal cell phones.  I call them anytime I want.  We text photos of the kids if they had a rash.  Many times they give advice and we don't go in.  One time we had to rush to the hospital.  
Public health care is the worst.   Super long waits and the government decides who gets care and who doesn't.  Another major factor that you see huge is connected people, family and friends move to the front of the line in a government health care system.  Abuse is rampant and they have zero competition because many times the government will outlaw private health care. 
So I'd say corruption, long wait times, poor quality of care , and in general the doctors are not as motivated.  Those four reasons but many others.  
And we haven't even gotten into the contracts.  Private hospitals make contracts to save money and get the best.  Governments make deals by who donated to which campaigners and then those guys get to staff the hospitals with their products.  
The list goes on.  I can't believe you're a socialist but into Bitcoin?  Makes zero sense to me.  Bitcoin is best invention of my life specifically because it gives power to the people and way from special interests, the connected, the powerful and the government.

USA burns a ton of money for no reason.  No doubt. 
I meant they don't have malpractice insurance.  Obviously any doc can make a mistake.  
But the main argument against single payer is the same argument against communism.  Why not pool all our money for food?  For housing?  Then we just provide for everyone equally.  
Reason is that it does not work.  Private enterprise works better and raises living standards for everyone. 
This has been proven throughout history.  Socialism and communism just don't work.   That's why China and India have moved hundreds of millions out of poverty.  The free market.

WHAT????   The GERMANS have limits?  That makes me sick.  They know about government encroachment. They know what happens when you give the government too much power what they can do. 
Amazing how the poor who have nothing ignore this and allow the government to take over.  
EDIT:  Did a search and no limit.  In 2016 they tried to make the limit 5k and the German people rose up.  
These people had Hitler.  They are not stupid.  They know governments are prone to illegality.

Funny.  History and real life has taught me people love to believe their government "protects" them and makes things so wonderful but the truth is if you rely on government they will disappoint you over and over.  .
You'll get thrown a bone and every now and again. Makes you feel good but nearly compared to what you put in. The well connected are feasting and laughing at the people getting a W-2 and following the rules while they abuse them and rewrote the rulebook if it so pleases them.

@_date: 2018-05-26 16:44:23
The only reason Bitpay and many companies using BCH and the only reason BCH even exists is because of high cost or transactions for sending Bitcoin. 
That has subsided for now but back in December it was off the charts.  $50 was the average at one point.  It wasn't usable.  
So if we focus on LN and other improvements then the purpose of BCH is gone and it will not be used.  All their supporters will move to Bitcoin.  
That is where our enegeries should be.   Attacking the root cause and not the symptoms.

Centralized is more efficient but requires us to TRUST the person running the system.  Trust the government. Trust the corporation.  Trust the database and their backups.  
Blockchain removes that trust.  It's a trustless system.  Anyone can review the blockchain.  6 confirmations and it can't be wrong.  
If we avoid someone centralizing Bitcoin by running 51% of the miners, controlling discussion, controlling the source code, or controlling exchanges.  
As long as we remain decentralized you can trust Bitcoin because there is no one to trust.  Its only math.

Where is it illegal to fly with over 10k?  Definitely not in the domestic United States.  Definitely not international leaving or coming into the states.  *You have to fill a form out for international flights if over 10k but can still bring it*
There might be few legal reasons to be out and going to the ATM at 3am BUT THAT IS YOUR RIGHT and anyone who doesn't like it should go screw off. 
If you're not hurting anyone else than everyone should be quiet and allow it. Not to mention the most important part about it will make it so much easier for a tyrant to assume total power.  
In many counties they raided the pension funds because they can. If you know what happened in Greece with the banks all closing for a good amount of time. 
Cyprus just flat out stole one third of all bank accounts a few years ago to give money to the government.  
If you think this can't happen in your country you're insane. Not to mention negative interest rates.  Inflation hurts the poor savers.  
Bitcoin is the answer to so so much.  Definitely the best invention of my lifetime.  Gives freedom and stops the politicians from controlling the money supply.

To me we really can't drop too far below 4k.  
3k maybe, but to say we've only grown 300% in a year is really insane.  
And almost positive we would rise from there.  
So at $7500 I see a ton of upside.  15k would be different but at $7500 I see a good chance to 10x your money in five years.

You're the original person to make the argument.  You're argument is we shouldn't do business with companies that deal in Bitcoin Cash. 
Meaning Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken, Bitstamp, Bitfinex and basically every single exchange is out.  All should be banished from the ecosystem.  
My response is that is ridiculous and would harm Bitcoin a ton more than help it.  Maybe if we had a much bigger playing field with ten monster exchanges and ten airline shopping sites you could pick half that didn't support BCH then ok.  
I still find it dumb but at least its practical.  Your argument today is not.  
And of you have used Coinbase in 2018 or another exchange that supports BCH you're also a hypocrite.  
@_date: 2018-05-15 20:52:49
I have to disagree. 
Governments are horrible and in efficient and evil and constantly throughout history have proven to infringe on our rights over and over.  
Most of the evil in the world is directly tied to big governments.  
Most of the evil corporations get away with is because of government help. Even the concept of a corporation is a government idea.  Corporations have limited liability with government protection.  
Jim Crow, Slavery, apartheid, black empowerment, affirmative action, rippling taxes, wars, genocide, and privacy violations are all done by governments. 
Get the government out of the way as much as possible and become like Dubai, Hong Kong or Singapore.  Our best three examples.   
Finally when government got out of the way on the 80s in China and 90s in India we brought hundreds of millions out of poverty and into the world economy.  
This is why Bitcoin is the most important invention of our lives.  Power to the people.  Power away from the ultra wealthy, well connected, and governments.

1) I said what governments do. Not the reasons we have them.  Read any history.  Governments are the most evil institutions in the history of Earth. 
Just because you haven't lived it doesn't mean it doesnt happen.  Ask someone whose lived in Germany for 80yrs or Venezuela today.  Those people understand how important cash is.  How intrusive and disgusting governments can be.  
2) Banks make mistakes and freeze people's accounts.  Happens all over the planet.  No bank is immune from it. Mistakes happen.  They're human.  
Also investigations happen into innocent people and accounts get frozen there also.  
3)  right now to have a savings account in Switzerland you have to PAY to keep your money in the bank. The interest rate is negative.  It's super close to zero in Europe and many want it to go negative so everyone has to pay. 
4)  You kindly ignored my statements on Cyprus and Greece when the ATMs all closed for weeks.   Then the banks took 33% off the top on accounts to give to the government.  
Maybe some of those people wish they had held onto €500 notes.  *(which of course the government wants to get rid of also for these same exact reasons)*
If you seriously think government is this wonderful thing you've not read the news, not read history and are keeping your eyes closed.  
Talk to some people on high levels of government and ask them how efficient things are.  Ask them how things work are the top of government bureaucracy.   
Why are you even into Bitcoin?  Bitcoin is the best invention of my lifetime.   Bitcoin gives power fo the people.  Takes power away from the mega rich and well connected. Takes power away from governments.  That's a good thing.  
**EDIT.**  Denmark and Sweeden you also have to pay to put money on savings.  Not coincidently these are two counties with some of the lowest cash usage rates on Earth.

Wow.  Why are you even into crypto? I hope your just ignorant. Please do some research and read history.  
Governments are evil and encroach on civil liberties. This is why we MUST have cash, gold and Bitcoin.  
People that didn't experience this make comments like yours but people like the Germans know better.  They LOVE their cash and when a €5000 limit was attempted they rose up in massive defiance.  
You want a guy like Hitler or any other tyrant to take over and have to use a bank he controls to make all payments?  Cash is a super essential item for privacy.   Bitcoin too now.  Gold also.  Stand up and don't let freedom be taken for granted.

Lot if people think only $10B fiat invested in crypto. So another $10B would double it.  
This shows we don't need numbers but institutional money.  One company invests $100m and you can forget the $100 people.

What does this have to do with what we're talking about?
Bernie Madoff used the dollar in his scam. 
Guess the USD is crap. 
Also ... many countries like Denmark, Sweeden and Norway you can't hold a physical bill.  They're not allowing cash at many banks.   Other counties will follow.  
Your fiat system daily turns more and more against the physical bill you champion.

She's a scientist but took pills and didn't know what they were?  Not to mention this guy is a sociopath. He goes for what he wants.  He doesn't wait for it to come to him.  Zero chance it happened that way. 
She has sex with him because he was giving her a ton of money or because she wanted the deal to keep going. Then the research ended and she had to cut ties  
He cut the power the MOMENT she sent an email to Dad? Uh... BULLSHIT.   She's an adult and can't take a taxi to Belize City and fly out the next day?  She could have left at anytime.  
Then she contacts the FBI and is surpised to find out the FBI doesn't have worldwide jurisdiction?  Seriously.  She is a moron and her story sucks.

43% ?  We're down 60% from the high right now and it was as low as 70%  
This ain't like the other 2016 and 2017 drops.   This is something new 
I think we'll overcome it but honestly this might be a copy of 2014. .
2014 = 2018
2015 = 2019
2016 = 2020
2017 = 2021. 
Under this theory we'll lose this year.  Who knows how low but 2014 went down around 75% off the high so looking to end the year around $5000. 
Break even in 2019 all year.   Stay around 5k or between 6k and 8k. 
Go up 3x or so in on 2020.  End the year around 20k.  
Absolutely explode in 2021. We fly to 100k+
Honestly not bad if we repeat that history.  Low downside.  Insane upside.  
@_date: 2018-05-13 22:58:45
Don't want government encroachment in their private lives.  The middle class want freedom to do as they wish without big daddy government telling them they can or can't do this or that.  
The government protects the wealthy and well connected. 
@_date: 2018-05-15 20:38:49
Money should be a medium of exchange but it's used by governments as a medium of control.  
Governments are abusive and limit our rights. History has shown us this over and over.  
Why stop at €1000?  Why not fully outlaw cash?  That way the big banks can control every transaction you make.  
If they accidentally freeze your account, then of well. Get a lawyer *(happens all the time)*  If Greece or Cyprus happens then oh well, you lose 33% of your money.  Governments need it.  Right?  
If they do negative interest rates and basically tax you just for having money. That's ok too.  
So now that you can't use cash the government has control over what transactions are allow and which ones are not.  When if a tryant comes to power it's much easier for them to control the populous.  Freeze the accounts of his enemies and immediately take strict control and the people will have no means to fight back. 
Cash, Gold and Bitcoin are tools that give us financial freedom.  I'm shocked by the fact that you agree with this €1000 limit but support bitcoin?  Bitcoin was created to give power to the power.  Not to the mega rich, well connected and governments.  
@_date: 2018-05-30 19:24:09
All the people that say fees don't matter are dead wrong. I know still a lot of you out there and I'm sure I'll get downvoted. 
This 7yr low is massively important and essential and cannot be understated.  As someone who uses Bitcoin often, this is music to my ears and I'm sure the same in the business community.  
We must keep this up.

Middle class want government handouts.  Governments freebies.  But they also would take ANY freebies.  
If the government or some other entity gave them free health care theyre gonna take it. 
However it doesn't come for free. Just like Facebook isn't free...you give your data.  **Always a tradeoff.**  Freebies for less freedom.  But in the government case we're able to separate the freebies from the freedom.  Not totally but we can do better. 
Ultra rich get way way more handouts from government then free health care.  Friend of mine got his company to get $20m in loans from the Obama stimulus at 4% instead of a bond at 12%.  You know what this made him over ten years?
He was laughing and i don't blame him for talking it.  But still... doesn't mean we want it  These things cannot happen with Bitcoin.  No free Bitcoin.

CheapAir is awesome.  I fly all over and exclusively pay in Bitcoin now.   CheapAir and Destinia are the only two companies that really accept Bitcoin  *(BTCAir doesn't count)*
I've have a ton of experience with these three and can say without a doubt, CheapAir is by far the greatest.  
If you have to change your flight you can call and they'll change and then bill you over email in crypto giving you hours to make payment.  
If your flight is canceled they ask for a BITCOIN address to refund. This is not an experience you'll have with others. 
Bottom line is CheapAir is the best for booking flights.  They've been doing it for years now.  Please support this company if you can.

Those people have been around for five years and all of a sudden Bitcoin price drops and people want to bash us nonstop.  
Those people don't just make fun of hodl and say we're silly.  That subreddit is dangerous. 
They actually believe from the bottom of their hearts that blockchain has zero viable usage in the world!  They actually believe this.  They don't understand the value of a trusted system with absent authority *(as if Bitcoin hasn't beyond proved this the last nine years)*
I challenged someone saying the millions invested by fortune 500 companies........ they said that's only companies capitalizing on the newest fast purely for advertising purposes.  
I mean we need to take this subreddit and stop advertising it because all we're doing is adding members to their cohort.

I love to gamble too. That's why I bought a lot under $300.  Most said I was crazy.  But we had nine months from February to October 2015 when Bitcoin just sat there under $300.  
I never sold.  Obviously wish I did.  But no one is ever gonna pick the high and the low everytime.   I'm sure they'll be plenty of times you end up on the sucker side of a trade yourself.  
Maybe someone will be there to rub it in.  If you do make money I figure the reward is the money itself and bashing in others doesn't make me any happier.   
@_date: 2018-06-27 18:22:22
Never meant to judge and of course if you don't want to use, you should not.  
I just really feel like so many people have accepted Bitpay through their business and were scared of Bitcoin and how they're not and even support it. 
So I feel like we should like their company.  
@_date: 2018-06-23 06:25:53
Super valid point.  Maybe I'm looking at it wrong.  And same thing.  Who would buy at $6000 that didn't think $7500 was a steal.  
This is probably it.   Especially when they say volume declining.

@_date: 2018-06-23 08:05:50
Yeah.  But I also believe in Bitcoin and never have planned on fully getting out 100%  
And how many of people like me are there?  The price from February 2015 to November 2015 fluctuated from $220 to $280.  
I remember how happy we would get if we went up 5 dollars for the day. So many back then just assumed Bitcoin would always trade in this range.   
What I'm saying is I couldn't grt any of my friend to buy until we hit $2000.

Yeah.  So Bitcoin is Gold plus cash.   
Bitcoin is a store of value with a limited supply.   
Then a bonus is the ease of P2P usage.  Although when you look at fees and slow block times it's not where we want it to be quite yet.

Article from 2014 in the Guardian.  
Ended 2014 in the $300s from a peak of $1100.  
All of 2015 sat between $220 and $280 basically. 
2016 was a big year and ended at $980. 
2017 we went parabolic and up 20x.   
2018 looks like 2014.  Cycle plays out again?

@_date: 2018-06-21 23:05:06
Gold is the best analogy for Bitcoin.  It really makes a lot of sense and prior to 2017, many of us came directly from investing in Gold to investing In Bitcoin.  
The community has changed a lot but hopefully they realize this is the kind of goal we want.  Central banks eventually will all hold Bitcoin.  
Ultra high net worth individuals will hold 5 to 10% of their wealth in Bitcoin.  
I see it happening.  And this is how Bitcoin flies above $100,000.  Hopefully sooner rather than later.  
@_date: 2018-06-23 08:14:43
So you see it dropping to $1000 ?
@_date: 2018-06-18 22:26:48
Although $6000 has proven true for the last six months.  Last time under $6000 was October 28th, 2017.    
Not saying it cannot happen, but so far the $6000 argument has been solid.  And when we touched $6100 the other day, it only lasted an hour or so until coming back to $6300.    
I hope we hit bottom but we'll see.  
@_date: 2018-06-14 19:39:46
So basically you have no clue but you listen to whatever you hear and don't think for yourself.  Thanks for confirming it.

Profit is the point.  That's why our store shelves are filled.  Companies want profit so they fill the store shelves. They ain't doing it for charity or fun.  
There's no profit to be made in Venezuela so this empty shelves because no one wants to fill.  
It's why airlines are leaving and a million other companies.  Profit is good.

I'm the biggest supporter of Bitcoin there is.  Living the Central America shows the benefits of Bitcoin daily.  
But a little background on Costa Rica.  They have the highest employment tax on Earth. 
To hire someone you must pay 30% of their salary to the government.  Then the employee pays 10%  
So not surprisingly half of the employees get paid under the table.  A common practice is if you make $2000 a month, then you'd get $500 legally paying the insane % and then the $1500 in cash or paid from an offshore bank with zero tax.  
The authorities are so busy finding employers paying it all under the table they almost encourage and thank the employers enrolled and paying something.  
The government just doesn't have the resources a first world country does.  
Point being, if the portion under the table was Bitcoin or Cash is irrelevant and really nothing has changed or improved. 
**TL, DR... The government didn't make a statement saying employees can be paid in Bitcoin.  It's just obvious with zero government enforcement this can happen.** 
@_date: 2018-07-26 16:56:50
They'll never steal his money.  That's illegal.  Closing accounts the bank can do for any reason
@_date: 2018-07-04 17:25:29
Half their traffic but not half their revenues.   Major difference. 
**SIDE NOTE**
*I'll never ever understand the need to bash a company that has done so much for Bitcoin as Bitpay*
*I use BitRefill all the time as well to load my Steam account and their service is fantastic*
Both companies deserve a place in our ecosystem and ought to be thanked. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 16:00:43
I've know people and since 2002 they've been paying under the table and there are zero consequences. 
If someone sues you in Costa Rica to get to the actual trial you can delay this to 3yrs easily.  First step is you say you can't speak Spanish and that's an immediate 6month delay to find an interpreter for example.  
Then they'll pay any witness the Tico has $200 to take their name off the witness list and once you've submitted your witness list you cannot add more people.  
The system are archaic and super in favor of the rich.  By the time the trial does happen in three years my friends will maybe not even show.  
The corporations are put in names of random ticos they paid $200 anyways so they're names are nowhere on it  
I'm not saying it's impossible but the current system is so flawed.  Amazon or other bjg companies I'm sure has to follow the rules but if you're intent on going around them it's beyond simple.  
And if the payoff is 30% of the salary that is just too high of a number not for many to do this.   
Good news is my friends pay their employees $3k to $10k a month so overall while they spit at Tico laws they're a massive benefit to Costa Rica and should be welcomed with open arms instead of chastised by the government and sued by their employees.

If central banks and institutional money flow in then all retail investors will be made whole.  If Bitcoin becomes the new Gold then what you're saying won't happen.

Investigate this. 
1st .....The investigators that went after him for proven to be criminals and are in jail.  And the testimony of those agents and the work of those agents was a part of how Ross got caught AND the judge refused to allow this information into the trial.  
2nd ...The main reason is the sentanced.  For a non violent act he got life.   Many other drug dealers who actually dealt drugs got less than ten years.  Almost all legal experts agree that Ross's sentanced was unprecedented on a massive scale. 
3rd ... while one and two are universal and obvious, the fact that adults cannot conduct business  with other adults in a non violent fashion and purchase drugs rubs many the wrong way including me.   
If I want vicodin or adderall or valium or weed, why would I have to see a doctor and get a prescription?  Maybe I've been on one of these drugs for years and my doctor moved away.  I'm in my 40s and pay for myself and accept no funds from the government for welfare.   
I find it hard to understand how that's not legal.  And on top of that looking at the bigger drug war and the farce it is with the USA funding these poor countries to keep drugs illegal while the DEA gets billions mostly to fight weed. Marijuana is 80% of the budget. 
So yeah ... hard to saw Ross deserves life sentance.

I fully agree. But that battle has been fought and decided.  Bitcoin Core is absolutely not raising the block size ever.  
If they ever were going to, they would have last fall.  Could have doubled to 2GB, and gotten LN up and rolling.  
But they've decided no so we have BCH and BTC. Maybe for the best honestly.  Bitcoin Cashn removed segwit and highly dislikes it.  Which honestly I have no clue.  
Best we can do is hope LN is massive success.

The real criminals are the investigators that went after him.  They have been tried and convicted have been and are in jail.  
Imagine law enforcement turning in their own people.   The crimes are so blatant they knew it would come out.   These two investigators were key to Ross going away.  
AND the judge refused to allow this information into the trial so the jury had no idea the investigation was tainted by these dirty cops.

There are so many businesses and a massive ecosystem.  That's what Bitcoin is.   
So if the code is changed we'd fork off and the real Bitcoin would be the one that kept things consistent. 
This has happened (Bitcoin Cash) and almost happened (Seqwit2x) in two major instances.  Also many minor ones.  
Could be a weakness as every system has strengths and weaknesses but it doesn't take away from the system. 
Just the like the US Constitution decentralized power between the executive, legislative and judiciary.  If we all stop following the constitution at once it won't work obviously.  
Doesn't mean that a constitutional based governance is a bad theory.  The enforcement is the general consensus.  There has to be consensus to make a decentralized platform work.  
Bitcoin has this.  It's has this consistantly over ten years.  
Now that we're many times larger than just six months ago, no reason not to assume our ecosystem won't continue to flourish and grow.

I respect your opinion but BIP91 or any BIP is not a vote in any sort of democratic way. 
They disagreed and left.  I would think that makes Bitcoin stronger since now the contention is gone.  They go their way.  We'll go our way.  
We won't know for years who wins and saying it took an hour for one transaction is certainly possible.  In November and December it was death to send any Bitcoin though.  Fees were $50 and that's not a reasonable long term solution.

I thought it hit 90%.   I googled and first article showed 80%  maybe I should have gone lower but you're saying majority of miners didn't and that's not true.  That's a fact.

Ha.  When I heard of Bitcoin I was crazy. I'm an anarchist libertarian and Bitcoin fits my world view like a perfect glove. 
I was only responding to your insane comment of a ponzu scheme when Bitcoin has the network effect.  
**And this is why I'm into Bitcoin:**
A centralized database takes one click to adjust. A record with zero oversight which forces us to TRUST. 
I don't trust every government on Earth.   You shouldn't either.  
Shouldn't have trusted Enron or WorldCom or the vote counts if 3rd world nations.  
Blockchain would have been a powerful weapon against those situations.  
**That's what Bitcoin is.** 
It's to get around idiotic central authority.  So when you live in Venezuela and they won't stop printing money and won't give access to dollars, and make bank accounts worthless .....
 you might have one small weapon against this tyrannical overreach.  
That's what Bitcoin is about.  Making the world a better place and human beings accountant in a more trustless system.  And Bitcoin has proven it in ten years.  
Decentralization has been proven over and over.  Hell the US Constitution and the revolutions of 19th century Europe were based on decentralizing authority away from one absolute king.  And these new forms of government have been more transparent and superior to the old ones. 
And yes made the world a better place.  Harder to make things happen than in China or Russia or North Korea. But the right way to be.

Did anyone review this?  They moved from MTGox into some wallet that had 24,000 bitcoin prior.  
Of that 24,000 bitcoin, it seems it was mostly gone but 443 bitcoin remained.  
So they took 2,000 from eight wallets from MtGox into a wallet that had 443 bitcoin sitting there since Feb 16th.  
Total 16,443 bitcoin in the new address.  That's the one we should be watching now.

I honestly can't believe SWATing accidents ever happen. 
**I never knew the didn't actually call 911.**  SWATers can't call 911 because they wouldn't be transferred to the correct police department. 
Think about that.  So someone has blown someone's head off and has hostages and going to kill them and himself .... but the guy actually had time to find a non emergency phone number to contact police instead of simply dialing 911 which is easy and everyone knows that number?
How is this a phenomenon in the United States?  
Unless someone calls 911, the police need to check it out but it should be a super cautious situation.  
@_date: 2018-04-29 23:10:21
To let you know where this all start.....I was just explaining to someone who said miners were against increasing the block size which was not true.  I didn't say I agreed or didn't.  I just said miners are very much in favor of increasing block sizes.  


Many people including me at the time felt like BCH was a betrayal of the agreement of Seqwit2x.  We were trying to make the compromise work, and I believe had BCH not forked than 2x would have happened.  
Not sure what you mean by "endue" a hard fork.  Hard forks are just another work for upgrade.  Almost every coin (including Bitcoin) has had many hard forks.

So true.  I just really felt during 2015 we couldn't lose.  I have another side of whiners even though most are that way. 
I had a close family member agree and buy a massive amount at $250.   I told him to buy a small amount, not a big one because I know him.  
Well....we hit $500, and I told him don't sell were headed to $30,000.   He sold of course.   I was so so mad.  But he doubled his fiat value.  
Still today he's so happy with me that I got him to double his money.   He said even if he kept in there was no way he could have not sold at $1000.   
He just bought way too much.  Better to buy a little and hold.

The BCH folks never supported 2x and they celebrated when it was pulled back.  BCH never wanted seqwit ever. They hate it.  
The Bitcoin Core developer never supported 2x and celebrated when it was pulled back. 
**Both groups were on opposite ends then and now.**
There was a moderate group in the middle that the vast majority *(including me)* supported that said let's do seqwit and double the block size. Both sides have to compromise. 
The extremes won out over moderation and the vast majority opinion. 
Not sure what you mean by "tolerated" as I assume the goal is Bitcoin should be an open and free community and all views should be welcome.  Then we debate and argue and decide the best ways forward.  
That's how consensus is decided upon.

One side wanted seqwit and no block size increase 
One side wanted block size increase and no seqwit. 
Most of us just loved Bitcoin and wanted to keep the community together.  Seqwit2x was born.  Vast majority of miners supported it. Vast majority of companies supported it. Vast majority of users supported it.  
Seqwit2x was a compromise that added seqwit and made a small block size increase.  Seemed super reasonable to the vast majority of people *(including me)* and would keep Bitcoin together. 
Most assumed of Seqwit2x happened Bitcoin Cash would die. 
However, the extremes that control the reddit channels did not.  The extremes that control bitcoin dot com and other media on the other side did not want to make a deal.  
So instead we have two camps.   And maybe this way is better. Everyone follows what they want.  
But to your pt.  You're 100% incorrect that miners didnt support Seqwit2x which absolutely included a small 1mb increase in the block size.
