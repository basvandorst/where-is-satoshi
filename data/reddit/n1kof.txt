Maybe you know what kind of documents they accept for proof of address? 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:06:36
Does it mean that we will be losing 36.067% of our funds, and they will be repaying that amount later on?
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:21:23
I guess you meant "haven't", right? :P 
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:13:15
You also had money there? ;(
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:13:49
Also "Your account is currently on withdrawal hold. All withdrawals will be held in a Pending Approval state until the hold is lifted. The most common triggers of a withdrawal hold are account password changes and the changing of certain security settings. Please contact support with questions or concerns. This hold will be lifted at August 13, 2016 09:29."  I get this message when I go to withdraw section
@_date: 2016-08-10 18:01:59
2 hours passed, still haven't received anything..
@_date: 2016-08-08 12:24:40
So that means, that we will not have a 5 day lock, right?
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:00:19
any information about this one?
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:07:38
Other people also had things like ETH and so on. Just take this portion as a chance to move forward without crying on them, good luck.
I also have usd there, and I'm kinda happy about that situation.
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:20:41
"All withdrawals will be held in a Pending Approval state until the hold is lifted. " But from this message we can see, that you won't get a withdrawal until your hold is lifted at a certain time
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:51:20
will your verification crew be working in weekends?
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:44:59
I think 12 hours is the best option for you guys
@_date: 2016-08-10 08:35:28
I understand BFX tokens being as a new currency too, like bitcoin, but it will only belong in bfx website (Only my opinion)
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:57:24
Dunno, Zane mention something about monday, but he probably talked about already active wire transfers that happened before hack and since banks don't work in weekends, these guys should get their money on monday, no idea tbh
@_date: 2016-08-11 08:04:51
My btc withdrawal has been processing for 10 hours already, still haven't received them, probably employees went to sleep?
@_date: 2016-08-05 09:32:41
Do you understand that making the system safe and everything of this is super time consuming? it's super hard to have ETA time for that once it's gonna be finished, especially for , who is not related with site coming back up. You better try to do it by yourself and we would see in how much time you would make that site back again, have a nice day :)
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:11:43
But they still belong to $1 when it comes to refuding people of that 36% loss?
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:26:13
What is the email to contact verification department? Also, is there a way to see what documents I need to fill in before asking them first? 
@_date: 2016-08-05 17:48:12
What if I'm a student, and utility bills are sent to my parents?
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:17:48
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:21:12
5 grands? More like 24 grands...
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:02:13
From my view, he is talking that they want to make new announcement today, correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:09:37
Try to image your situation, if you had btc in that time ;)
@_date: 2016-08-09 11:53:40
These kind of threads help other people to not get scammed with fake wallets, and what have you done good in this wonderful world?
@_date: 2016-08-05 09:50:04
!remindme 3 hours
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:33:15
As far as I know, we should be able to withdraw full money (those who held only usd)
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:23:31
OP is talking that his 43 BTC just got withdrawn by the hacker, so he just got left with 0 BTC right now, which is minus ~$24,000 (if that happened to his account).
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:50:00
Please post it here, if they will be working, cause I wrote them yesterday, got first answer in like 30 mins~ then wrote message for them again for more information regarding proof of address, but haven't got an answer yet ;/
@_date: 2016-08-05 09:15:36
You need to take a look into this opportunity with your team too, if you haven't thought about that before
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:28:10
Sadly, but held like 70-80% of my money there in usd ;&lt;
@_date: 2016-08-10 21:34:57
I did 0.5 btc withdrawal 5 hours ago, still no response, 10 mins ago I did 3btc withdrawal and got them instantly, no idea why :D
@_date: 2017-02-01 18:48:19
I'm using the latest version tho, no option for that :(  btw, how do you get 58 satoshis per byte? 
@_date: 2017-02-02 22:36:09
Yeah, it got confirmed, I used that accelerator ;P 
@_date: 2017-02-01 18:06:45
How should I count those satoshis per byte? because I'm using multibit wallet, and I can only choose transaction fee o.O
@_date: 2017-01-24 17:56:42
The transaction is visible in blockchain right now 
I guess I just need to wait right now, right?
@_date: 2017-01-06 13:28:23
RemindMe! 1 day
@_date: 2017-01-24 17:02:28
"1DSonpg5Cvv4BnLe5ojasRbBAYasx3WVia" this address is with the same amount as my multibit shows unconfirmed money 1.43923135
I'm kinda new to this "Child Pays For Parent". What exactly I need to do in this situation?
@_date: 2017-01-24 17:21:22
This is the image of my wallet, the amount that is being in 1DSonpg5Cvv4BnLe5ojasRbBAYasx3WVia address is the same as it shows in my unconfirmed section, that's because of the sent transaction I believe. So how I should make sure that all my balance is on 1DSonpg5Cvv4BnLe5ojasRbBAYasx3WVia?
**EDIT:** I missread your sentence I guess, This is correct, that all unconfirmed balance is on 1DSonpg5Cvv4BnLe5ojasRbBAYasx3WVia address, right now I did what you said, put fees on 0.001 sent to one of my address. Now I just need to wait I guess? 
Thanks for at least little help, I really need to sort out this problem 
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:35:05
Could you give us the link where we could find this information?
@_date: 2017-01-24 17:36:54
Nope, MultiBit doesn't let send unconfirmed output.
@_date: 2017-01-24 17:52:50
So what you would suggest to do right now for me? Wait? Also, do you have any idea why it doesn't show the transaction in blockchain.info? Is it because all 3 output transactions are unconfirmed?
Because transaction should be there, as multibit is saying for me : 
That guy used kraken's wallet's address and he can't see any transaction coming up from me
@_date: 2017-01-24 17:38:33
But also, the thing is that this transaction is not being shown in blockchain for some reason. The transaction that I sent right now with 0.001 fee to my address is already confirmed.
@_date: 2016-11-07 17:54:12
Good luck :D
@_date: 2016-11-03 18:37:48
Probably because bitfinex is doing 1 hour maintenance ;) 
@_date: 2016-02-24 22:11:17
But that guy sent me 2 same payments, and one got already confirmed in like 10-20 mins, but for another one i have to wait 8+ hours...
@_date: 2016-02-24 22:28:35
That guy uses blockchain.info   Since i don't have that wallet, i don't know if it's possible
@_date: 2016-02-24 22:27:52
both had same amounts paid, and he told me, that blockchain should have paid fees automatically. Btw, is there any way to higher up the fees on unconfirmed transaction?
@_date: 2016-02-24 22:31:32
in how much time transaction can disappear?And that guy will get his money back, right?
@_date: 2016-02-24 22:51:13
What does RBF mean, and is it possible for him to do it through blockchain.info?
@_date: 2016-02-24 21:46:38
Ah... but seriously? :D
@_date: 2016-02-24 22:29:29
How do you know?
@_date: 2016-02-24 22:10:45
Well, it's the payment that I am getting into my wallet, that guy sent me 2 same payments, 1 got confirmed in like 10-20mins and another one is still unconfirmed
@_date: 2016-02-24 22:14:06
Well, it's not my payment, a bit missleading topic from my side, but still, is there any way, that guy could rechange transaction fee, or we just need to wait now?
@_date: 2016-09-03 18:13:06
Would like to know too
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:40:45
If you see transaction in blockchain, it won't be gone anywhere anyways. don't worry ;)
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:40:11
Yeah, I can't login into my wallet either, probably most of us have the same problem. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 23:18:29
it's fixed already
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:43:19
Probably your transaction was low, and the btc network is flooded with the transactions right now. you can take a look there    Blockchain doesn't have any sort of things related to the confirmation of your transaction, it just depends how high your transaction fee is
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:45:37
@_date: 2017-07-20 12:02:18
There is an option to get private keys from the addresses in blockchain wallet, so I guess that's some kind of "control", right?
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:36:07
so what happens with that, that will never confirm? Will it get removed from the network or no?
