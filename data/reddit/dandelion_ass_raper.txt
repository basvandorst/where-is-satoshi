Here's the message the world gets from libertarians and anarchists on bitcoin: "Mine, mine!  Convert or Die!  I told you so!  You're stupid, I'm right!  Bitcoin rules and if you use it, you're ONE OF US, ONE OF US!"  Shit, I imagine folks will line up in the street so you guys can rub your dick all on their faces.  
Dumb asses.  
I'm glad bitcoin is just a decentralized, digital currency and not whatever the fuck you think it is.

You don't flip a coin.  You analyze and do what's best--what works for the most amount of people.  You DON'T start with an IDEOLOGY like libertarianism or anarchism and try to make all solutions fit in that framework--they won't.  
I'm afraid you ARE limited by your choice of your anti-ideology ideology.  LMFAO!

You guys should create a bitcoin faucet that any bitcoin not collected in a year goes to.

Now THAT is an understatement.  :)

Well then "free souls of the cosmos", stay the fuck out of the way of US Dollar corp.  US dollar corp. has established a dominant market position all over the world and should be free to use it's influence to get governments to outlaw bitcoin.  
Stop interfering with the free market as that's antithetical to your stance you free souls of the cosmos.

I find it hilarious when people think "sticking it to the man" is a silly idea when it comes to currency.  People just can't seem to make the connection to central groups creating and doling out money as they like to the huge divide between the wealthy and the poor.
I look forward to the day when a blue collar worker can earn an honest living because currency can't simply be fabricated into existence.  When this happens, real work is what will be paid and not those with friendly connections to the bankers.
I guess to some that just sounds like tinfoil hat type of stuff.

What he's really saying is libertarians and anarchists have adopted bitcoin and they would rather see it fail by shouting in the streets and attempting to make everyone associate bitcoin with their values than being inclusive to all and watching it flourish because adoption increases.
Basically these bandwagoning libertarians and anarchists don't give a shit about bitcoin.  They just want to rub their dick in peoples faces.
@_date: 2014-08-09 13:49:56
Neither one of those guys are anarchists.  Perhaps you should read what they write instead of assuming.
@_date: 2014-08-09 13:22:30
Not sure how that's political.
@_date: 2014-08-09 14:04:44
I agree.  In my opinion he wanted to make a more pure form of money where no one can cheat by creating it at will and lending it to friends and family.

With your name and a debit card number, bad actors can easily steal all your cash.  
With bitcoin, they get just what you send.
@_date: 2014-08-09 14:08:36
That's not an answer.  In this context, political means a fight over ideology not elected politicians. 
Would you feel better if the politicians doing the bidding of the banks were libertarians?
@_date: 2014-08-09 14:18:43
Yeah...that's what he wants the libertarian and anarchist extremists to think so they feel they have big, fat cocks they can rub in people's faces.
@_date: 2014-08-09 13:24:30
Not really.  You're libertarian and like to think of bitcoin that way.  
@_date: 2014-08-09 17:10:56
I feel sorry for you.  It must suck to live in a world where people are divided between being a statist or an anarchist.  People love their labels I guess.
@_date: 2014-08-09 13:18:09
Not really.  I never pick a team and I love bitcoin.  For all anyone knows, Satoshi could have been a republican, democrat or even smarter--he didn't pick a team.
Everyone should just do what works best.  Fuck ideology.  The truth is the first thing anyone wanting power tries to get the masses to do is pick a team.  Then we just fight with each other instead of getting real work done.

Bitcoin is a more pure money plain and simple.  It's as apolitcal as gold or cheese(used as money at places and points in time).
Also, money is usually not even controlled by government.  In fact, I'd think libertarians and anarchist would LOVE them some US dollar.  The US dollar is created and controlled by a non-government group that pushes the government around as a tool to do it's bidding.
Get out of the way of the US dollar you libertarians and anarchists, you're infringing upon the free market.  Then again maybe you don't like what happens when one company(US Dollar Corp.) becomes such a huge monopoly that it can get the government to write laws making other companies and their products(cryptocurrencies) illegal.  I say you guys are becoming less anarchistic and libertarian if you want a companies power and influence to be legally limited.  Oh the lolz.

I fucking said he was a cypherpunk.  You guys are god damned clueluess.  The cypherpunk movement has nothing to do with anarchy or libertarianism as much as you'd like it to.  Jesus.  I guess my wording on that confused you.
I find it funny that the US government actively pushes for encryption technology for people now (was not always the case) and anarchists and libertarians still associate cypherpunks with their movement. 
The cypherpunk movement has nothing to do with anarchy or libertarianism.  Those groups just need the intellectual capacity of cryptographers to make their cause seem more intelligent.
@_date: 2014-08-09 13:31:26
Lol...yeah Satoshi was a cypherpunk.  Gavin himself is a rad, rebel man on the edge of the libertarian, anarchy movement.  He's so cool bro.  Check out just how crazy an anarchist he is.  He even dresses like a punk man...yeah.
@_date: 2014-08-09 13:51:28
I'm afraid you just want people to be like you.  I'm human.  Try it.  I like what works.  Try that.
With your logic, anyone using gold or for that matter any currency fixed to gold (like the pre-1970s US dollar) was a libertarian.  Give me a fucking break.  Apparently, in your world view, all US citizens prior to 1970 were libertarian.
"Libertarianism...as anti-ideological as you can possibly get....unlike any OTHER ideology"  Oh the lolz on that one.

I have posted this link before but got downvoted for some dumb ass reason.  I have no association with the company and don't give a shit if they go under.  I did get a damn good cold storage box from them.  My only complaint is it took about a week and a half for delivery.  They have better deals consistently than anywhere else imo.
@_date: 2014-08-06 20:25:18
You've got to be trolling.
@_date: 2014-08-09 13:41:37
I hear libertarians and anarchists invented math and water even--so cool bruh!
