If it forks then the private key will control coins on two separate chains. Its not like the coins will disappear. In the end the longest chain will win. Only people who lose are people who get sent coins that end up on the resulting dead chain. In the case of the ETF, the coins aren't moving anytime soon anyways; I see no long term problems.

No matter how high the fees are, there will only be a certain amount of transaction that can be performed in a given block with a static blocksize. Why are we limiting the amount of transactions again?

If you sift through this list you can see that there is only about ~30% of the miners who have implemented or plan to implement SegWit at this time.
 
Company     Hashrate Distribution
BTCC           8.9%
Bitfury         8.1%
SlushPool     6.2%
BTC.com      4.3%
Bitclub         3.3%
Im not sure if this is going to activate. We need more compromise. Obviously there is not an overwhelming consensus here.

Technically solved, literally not
@_date: 2016-11-24 12:41:01


Obviously you don't mine, fees are nothing in terms of profits from current block rewards and on the other side miners can generate more fees if more transactions are included. A fee market will be appropriate when the time comes. We should not have a fee market while miners are subsidized. I think you've 420ed a little too much agent green.
@_date: 2016-11-24 12:54:41

There has been research done by well known institutions that say certain block size increases are safe with current technology.
[On Scaling Decentralized Blockchains](
Lets looks at the facts. We've been debating scalability for awhile now, why is one side of the argument constantly ignored? The idea of a blocksize increase predates SegWit. The fundamental problem is that there is no compromise even when it makes sense to do so. If it can be safely done, why not appease both sides so we can just get a solution?
@_date: 2016-11-24 12:09:15
Yah, I whine circles around you. I whine you so hard you, you forget the original arguments you make. Still no clarification on what you were saying earlier?

I am 100% sure the block rewards contributes way more to my profits than fees do. I guarantee it

Mhhmmmmm great, more content that has no value. Even dumbing down to name calling. Its pretty obvious why people should take your insight into the trash. I am using the better solution, that the lovely thing about Bitcoin, I can vote with my node and my hashing power.
@_date: 2016-11-24 18:10:10
Beautiful thing about difficulty is that whether there is 1mb or 20mb of transactions the hashing power required is the same. Why not include more transactions for the same amount of power?
@_date: 2016-11-24 11:28:52
Huh? I have no idea what that even means or how you even came to that conclusion. I have a problem with paying people more money for the same amount of work. Seems like you are a proponent for rent-seeking
@_date: 2016-11-24 12:37:46
Yes it is
@_date: 2016-11-24 12:16:34
Miners are, this number has been slowly increasing over time. Look at Classic adoption and the spill over into Bitcoin Unlimited.
@_date: 2016-11-30 10:00:23


Yes, death to Bitcoin. We will be stuck at our transactions throughput as a result of no blocksize increase and no Segwit. If you're ok with that, thats terrible.
@_date: 2016-11-24 12:11:26
I thought we made this clear already they get subsidized through a block reward. 
@_date: 2016-11-30 09:13:03

I will not get over it, which is why I'm suggesting a compromise is needed. We need to come together to meet somewhere in the middle.

By the way you still haven't clarified on what you meant. I think that it's highly possible you don't even know what you were trying to say.
@_date: 2016-11-24 12:15:37
Are you switching through user accounts. This is hilarious, at least choose different words to make it less obvious. The price is synonymous with the demand. Transaction fees being higher just means people are willing to pay more to transfer their BTC now. Whether that is into fiat or goods only time will tell, but if capacity is capped I am thinking the former. 
@_date: 2016-11-30 11:24:03

Mining solo doesn't allow you individually select transactions either. Whether I solo mine or mine on someone else's pool that runs unlimited I am still pressing for the same outcome, more transactions in a given block. I don't think you understand what a red herring is btw.
@_date: 2016-11-24 11:12:27
You're right it isn't free that what the block reward is for. While miners are subsidized, a fee market is not necessary. This is the time to gain greater adoption. Additionally with more transactions in a block you get more fees. Why pay a miner more money for the same amount of work? Their rewards should increase as more transactions get processed (More transactions in a block).
@_date: 2016-12-08 03:05:51
There is no consensus here. This will become more apparent as time progresses. People are unhappy because they are not being heard, this is the real problem. There is a tear in the community and compromise is currently off of the table.
@_date: 2016-11-30 11:43:07


No, I think I'm over this discussion with you.


It is obvious that although you agree that a block size increase is not a problem, based on your own citations, compromise is still not within your resolutions. People like you are whats wrong with the community.
@_date: 2016-12-08 06:20:56
I was asking for clarification, how does that mean I'm not open to learn? 
@_date: 2016-11-24 12:00:01
I don't abandon things that become difficult, but I can see why you would jump to that conclusion. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 11:36:09
Hmmm there you go with your pro-rent-seeking ways once again. They get a subsidy, but they want more? As a miner I highly disagree this is the sentiment; I rather have more fees from the influx of users we can get through the network effect. 
@_date: 2016-11-30 09:34:13


Although the amount of transactions included in a block increases, the blocksize technically stays the same.


(a) you really want blocks to stay &lt;1MB
(b) you want to retard the development of Lightning network tech. (which is trustless and peer to peer, not centralized and trust-requiring as is being constantly blatantly lied)
(c) you think (rightly or wrongly, probably wrongly) that as a miner your tx fee income is going to go down if segwit is implemented.
What about wanting more time for complicated solutions to go through further testing before being implemented?
Why can't lightening networks be developed while there is a larger block size?
I think a blocksize increase may be a good temporary solution while other solutions are being tested, instead of being rushed. Current technology can handle an increase to 8MB without too much burden on nodes and blocks won't instantaneously reach this new maximum anyways.
@_date: 2016-11-24 11:55:24
You're right, price is lower from an ATH. Scratch that not even above a 6 month high. Context is great, content on the other hand is lacking on your end.
@_date: 2016-11-24 12:24:52
No thats not what, I am saying you have it wrong.
Ohh still no evidence what a great surprise /s
@_date: 2016-11-30 11:02:54
It hasn't been activate because there is no consensus, which is what my original post was all about. There needs to be compromise.


I think this has been proven to be a 2x maximum savings with current deployment.
@_date: 2016-12-08 04:11:09
From my understanding we want LN to process small transactions and those aggregated transactions get processed on the blockchain. At some point people who are hosting LN will centralize as they collect more transaction and start to outbid other nodes with less. If you try otherwise to use the blockchain yourself, you will also be outbid (transactions fees) by large conglomerates who host the LNs. We must go through an intermediary to get our transactions processed, which means they will be the gate keepers to this network. To me this seems like more centralization, almost to the point where there is no difference from our current economic system.
@_date: 2016-11-30 10:48:46








4MB I believe was the number given in the Cornell study to have 90% of the node unaffected. I think around 40MB and 50% of the nodes are unaffected. This is based on the study you linked.


Yes, technically it does, but with the increase cost to ensure blocks remain balanced this number is effectively 2MB in relation to the current block size and throughput.
Based on the information I am gathering from these open discussions, it seems as though a compromise with with 4MB blocks and SegWit would increase our block capacity to effectively 8MB. Why can't we compromise if we know 4MB is safe and SegWit has been tested thoroughly? 
The block size increase will help with current throughput issues while softfork mitigation problems are ironed out with time.

You are forced to use the LN as a channel, maybe not a specific hub, but you are no longer able to transact on the chain without an intermediary. Sounds like our current bank system to me. You don't have to use JP Morgan you have a choice between Bank of America or Wells Fargo. Seems like an illusion of choice.


Not sure I follow. The way I see it is the longer transactions are delayed(in sense where transactions are in the process of being aggregated, not transaction backlog), the more room for a fractional reserve system. While funds are in limbo they can be repurposed. Resulting in a debt and credit environment like we currently see. These Hubs will be the more popular ones as they offer more "features" other more honest ones cannot. The honest ones will be pushed out of the system due to competition in the fee market. This outcome will always result in a hijack of the system.
How are Hubs held accountable anyways? Are their ledger's public? Who is going to enforce this and how can they?

Your response is the problem. You aren't genuinely seeking to hear the issues our user base is concerned with. Your fandom blinds you and triggers a defense, like a Apple fanboy facing the realities of a declining brand. This is an overarching theme in our community, this forum specifically. OP's post is signs of a defense mechanism from the critics of what is beyond this forum.
@_date: 2016-12-08 01:17:21
This forum is so blind. There is an issue and the more we ignore it the bigger it will become. Lets take a step back and just take in some of the criticism we have so we can work on our existing problems. The signs are here, pay attention.

The ETC/ETH was a result of a roll back that reversed the ledger not because of a "technical issue". You are comparing Apples to Dinosaurs. If anything we should learn from it that, due to bad politics and no compromise there was a hard fork.

@_date: 2016-02-29 17:29:32
By increasing the amount of transaction in each block, the amount of fees collected will become larger as more transactions are included. Miner should not be getting paid more for processing the same amount of transactions. At this point in time there is no need for fee market, miners are already being subsidized by the block reward. Putting an artificial cap on the amount of transactions being processed every 10 minutes is reducing the versatility of the network.
