Normally Trading should halt automatically once this type of issue occur..
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:40:32
Yeah.. all balances are showing zero..
Also last I have seen the trades were showing in queue and there were very few if them..
Not sure how it will trigger.. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:53:17
It is back..
Funds are showing proper now..
Also pending order queue is fine..
Need to check if any trade happened in last 15 mins..

All the swing cannot happen in 1 move :-)
From 4400 to 4000 was the first swing it went so a jump of 200-250 points is must..
Next time it reaches 4000 then 3600 to 3800 will be the point of jump to back to 4000 at that time

Fork is one of the reason and also it is clearly visible that people have sold altcoins to get into Bitcoin to get free coins.. so after the fork many will sell Bitcoin for altcoins and that should keep pressure on prices..
