Maybe an investor has some serious loses and/or gains in the equity market—or maybe a gain/loss in a real estate transaction and they want to include (“Claim”) this loss or capital gain as a tax benefit.

Helping make Bitcoin Cash GREAT AGAIN! Love it! They give the trash, slow as molasses BTC to their customers, who are probably all still waiting on their CONFIRMATIONS, lol. INSTEAD THEY KEEP THE BCH WHICH IS GONNA SEE AT LEAST A 200% GAIN BY END OF JANUARY TO AROUND $5k before BCH BITS THE MAGIC COINBASE PRICE OF $9,500 for BCH. BRILLIANT!! Well done ButtMex!

Just working on my BCH “Sell Wall” right now. Love accumulating at these prices—PATIENTLY—-then I can shove these down the throats of the FOMOers for HIGH PRICE NEXT WEEK. Oh man, I love Crypto. I’m sorry guys. But I just do. And I want to extend a HUGE thank you to all of you fomo’ing noobs and the weak-handed panic-sell scared money for making 2017 a truly AMAZING YEAR for ME financially!!! I AM however, sorry for YOUR loss, and only hope that one day you may turn a solid profit, but ONLY “after” experiencing the pain and mental anguish which a fomo’ing noob will at one time or another encounter—-for THIS!! this pain and loss and emptiness and guilt and shame experienced when you gave away your hard earned money to traders like myself—is the best catalyst to propel ones drive and perseverance to become a better trader—TO LEARN FROM OUR MISTAKES—to be able to TRADE WITH “ZERO” EMOTION...THIS my friends, is a static state I call CRYPTO-NIRVANA where the zeitgeist and the very heartbeat of the crypto markets  are coursing through your veins all day and night, as you can step back away from the 24hour/5 minute candle chart—step back for a more “macro” look at these markets where you can see and identify underlying market trends, shifting currency trading volumes and the ‘beta’ to benchmark (BTC) and how to trade in times of volatility or when BTC is flat and alts are booming. The market will always move towards attaining “equilibrium.”!Exactly what this will look like in 6 months to a years time or more is anyone a guess. However, by implementing some simple and available TA, in addition to macro and by examining other factors and influences outside of the specific Bitcoin and crypto eco-systems—politics, regulation, etc.—it is clear with a focused eye, we can see where the institutional aka ‘SMART MONEY’ has seen the potential that these markets have and in doing so they have taken a keen interest in trying to unite together the rambling lose knit group of geeky software developers and coders who have been maintaining the Bitcoin Network for almost a decade—most of it being surmounted to a thankless task—at least Until Wall Street took interest and the BTC price smashed through $10k a unit approaching its ATH of $20k....YUP, we got their attention now. But see, the geeky Bitcoin core coders and programming engineers all strongly believed that  “CODE IS LAW” and stubbornly refused to implement to BCH Block size upgrade. This IS NEEDED FOR BITCOIN AND THE ENTIRE ECO-SYSTEM TO SURVIVE. Wall Street knows this. BCH has strong marketing team and will pump to $10k. Good luck!
