Sorry but they're probably lost.

Publicly paying this type of ransom via Bitcoin will have this guy missing once a week.

We're in free fall, I cashed out to wait to buy back in when things stabilize.

Well that's like saying airlines support terrorism.

The way I see it is he lost 3.5 btc which is worth about $9800 per coin.

This is one of the unfortunate issues with crypro. If you fuck up or get robbed there's no one that can help you. I lost $1200 in steam skins from a hack and I was pretty pissed. Losing almost 35k must fucking blow.

This should make it much easier for the IRS to tax crypto to crypto transactions.

The IRS is using a software company called chainalysis. They can follow all your wallet movements and sales through the exchanges. There's no way to avoid this without risking an audit, fines and possible interest. Be happy you made money and pay your taxes.

Fuck as much as I would hate to do it, right now I'd have to take tether so I wouldn't be working at a huge discount.

It's PayPal that charges the $.25 fee. I have no desire to give them more money than they already make off me so I never pay the $.25 fee for an instant transfer. It used to take 2-3 business days before these new options.

It's 16k broken into 8 increments of 2k per wallet.

She could have sent you $65 through PayPal as a gift/family friends and it's compeletly free.

It's actually 16,000 btc moved and who knows if that's all that'll be moved.

When I transfer PayPal funds to my bank it takes one business day for free and for $.25 it's an instant transfer.

This was a wallet coins were moved to a few months ago when he was selling.
@_date: 2018-04-26 08:11:53
They are moving some coins around to an exchange wallet...
@_date: 2018-04-26 08:45:48
And now he's moving bch

If anything the markets will evolve and adapt the new technology.

Nothing will go to zero. Beanie babies, tulip bulbs and even bitconnect is worth more than zero.

The US is where they offer us $.25 for instant withdrawal and 2 day for free.
@_date: 2018-04-06 00:24:46
Not sure if serious...
