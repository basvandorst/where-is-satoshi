No I have not. My mining rigs needed a lot of attention. I feel kinda bad about it. I am not sure if I will have time during the year to do this.

Very well. I will look into that. I will need to refresh my C knowledge since I have been coding in C++ for a while now.

As its main use, I see it as a platform for others to write bots and analysis of the data the exchanges provide. Basically a standardised API with some added goodies.
I will look into the meta Web API idea. I will probably need to create a REST service, so I will need to read up on that.

By streaming, do you mean that the market data does not arrive in chunks but rather in diffs, or do you mean that the data arrives asynchronously as the market updates?
If it is the second, then that could be a problem on some markets like cex.io due to the API calls per minute limits.

I will look into that. I suspect that the only part that would be a portability concern is the actual tcpip layer(which is easily remedied). The initial version will be built for Linux though.

"client can subscribe for all kinds of events when the state changes"
That is an interesting one. I will keep that in mind.
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:13:16
Will do. Thanks for the feedback so far.

Yes I have seen your goxtool before. I just did not realise that you were the author. It looks pretty decent. I have a soft spot for CLIs.
I am still waiting for confirmation from my university. They are extremely anal when it comes to open-source licenses. Once that is done I will try and allocate some time to work on this.

Okay, that makes sense. The idea is to let the user access either cached or real-time data. Cached is for when fast computations and not so up to date data is required, while real-time is for well...real-time stuff. Adding the state update notifier will probably be intrinsic to the solution of the above functionality.

Agreed. Both are Turing complete, but so is BrainFuck.
If the choosing C above C++ provides measurable benefits then I am willing to refresh my C knowledge to rather tackle it in C.

Due to the nature of the problem, the solution does seem to lend itself toward object orientation. For example, exchange api wrapper is specialised for specific exchange APIs. These API wrappers can be part of a flyweight. The market pairs are composed of a pointer to a specific exchange etc. But I will look into it.
What bindings do you think would make it beneficial?

The core feature will be a client library that allows the user to work with different markets through a single interface. Once that is done, I can implement a webservice and have it run as a server if required.
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:56:05
I see your point. Would it not be just as simple to just create an server that can communicate through a socket of sort in order to allow other languages to leverage it?
