Check your local tax law, but where I'm from:
* There is no tax until you cash out, and a pile of fiat lands in your bank.
* Transactions where you spend BTC on goods and services aren't subject to capital gains tax.
~~This means that in theory, if your house or Lambo vendor accepted BTC directly, there would be no capital gains tax paid. For now...~~
[lol, I like how people downvote without knowing what my local tax law is... just facts innit.]

You're wrong. But I have redacted my cute last paragraph, as it was wrong.




Like I said, that's my local law, others need to check their local law.

They're saying only send B**T**C (Bitcoin) to that address.
Do not send B**C**C (Bitcoin Cash) to that address or you'll lose it. BCC is a separate, recently created coin that you do not need to worry about.

I knew we'd see some blood, but I didn't expect a spray of red like that. Goddamn :/

Borrowing to invest is common practice. Mortgages, margin loans etc.
A colleague of mine took out a loan of $500k to boost his share portfolio. All going well he'll be looking at returns far lower than BTC could produce, without about the same level of risk.
But it can be reckless and I agree with OP - don't do it unless you fully understand it. Definitely don't do it if you're new to speculating, and getting all caught up in the fever.

The bank in question didn't actually ban crypto purchases completely. Just via credit cards.




FWIW you can't buy stocks with a credit card either.

High energy consumption concerns me, but IMO it's only a concern when it's expensive, and burning fossil fuels. That's a very "today" problem.
Unlimited clean and cheap/free energy is out there in the form of renewables, and we're only just starting to tap into it. At some point in the future, it won't matter how much we use.

I took me weeks and weeks of small transactions for my limit to go up. Yes I had done every ID verification step possible. All I could do was dripfeed in a few bucks a day while the price was skyrocketing.
So I said fuck 'em and moved elsewhere.

OzCoin Lite. Very simple app to see current BTC, ETH, LTC, ETC prices in Aussie dollars.

Something about a Lambo surrounded by groceries is hilarious.

Only buy from Amazon or 
Amazon's difficult in my region, so I prefer the latter. Suggestion: Buy some BTC now including enough to cover the Ledger cost. Then buy your wallet from the Ledger site using BTC.
Just don't buy a crazy amount of BTC and leave it sitting on the exchange.

I'm in the club. But my purchase was only to replace the BTC I just spent on a Ledger Nano S (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞
