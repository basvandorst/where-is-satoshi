Thanks.  It was someone tipping me a dollar that got me into Bitcoin.  You're doing good work.

Thanks for the response.  I'll look into Bitcoin-core RPC.  I'll look into the feasibility in regards to time required.  Else, I'll look to parse.  Is [this]( a good place to get started?
Your second point is well taken.  Where I hope to go with it is modify some work from Reid and Harrigan, see [here](  Basically Reid and Harrigan had aggregated multiple input addresses into single users.  Of course this is not a perfect model---especially with mixing, etc.  But it does reduce transactions to a model of single source user and single destination user, so more existent network analysis methods can be utilized.

If you'd like to stay down to earth, while we sail away to the moon, that's perfectly OK too.

Also note there will generally be a 3+% fee for using a credit card.
@_date: 2015-11-05 00:50:15
That fee should be sufficient.  Maybe you need to fully sync the rest of the Blockchain (that is many GB of data btw) before it will actually propagate one of your send requests?

He'd only need 2 million of the ~15 million in circulation to be a billionaire now.  Might have more or less.  It would be speculation to say otherwise IMO.

They'll mass buy at cheap prices, leading a momentum surge.  Huobi will lead the way with Coinbase following, trading in excess of $530 by tomorrow morning US time.

Be cautious of trying to extract a location based on "relayed IP".  Unless you know something about this particular transaction that I don't...

Anybody have much knowledge of that site?  My intuition would suggest that it couldn't be driving that much volume.

Did you go through the process of creating a back-up?  The sequence with 12 words thing.

He has a strong monetary incentive for Bitcoin to go away.

Big exchange just shifting some money in their accounts?  Or big institutional investors getting in?

In about 12 months, I'll be 2048 times richer or so.  I'd be OK with that.

Most of the people actually at the auction are large institutional investors trying to buy into BTC at a discount from the current market rate.  There is zero reason for them to bid much above the market rate.  But---only 44,000 BTC are being sold.  There are 15 million mined.  Maybe half of this money is active in the market.  Say 7 million.  44,000 of 7,000,000 is less that 0.7%.  So the supply increase is not that great.  I guess I'd say--maybe a very slight bump temporarily, but the markets may have already priced a lot of this in.

So it's easy to send BTC into your account (they just give you a public address to send to).  Or wire cash into your account.  Then you can buy and sell BTC instantly on the market place (Huobi charges a 0.1% fee).  And it's easy enough to send BTC out of your account from Huobi.
But if you go to cash out (into USD or CNY), you must provide a ton of identifying info.  Wire transfer or OKPAY are the main ways to cash out into USD from Huobi.  Huobi charges a 1% fee.  (But as I mentioned before---it's really a lot of identifying info---verification of street address through credit card bills plus passport, etc.)  Cashing out into CNY (I believe) requires a Chinese bank card and then you get charged usually 0.50% by Huobi to do so.
@_date: 2015-11-04 03:59:15
Honestly, that fee sounds quite reasonable to me.  I can understand the want for transparency though.
@_date: 2015-10-30 03:33:59
It's pretty easy to buy and sell.  Cashing out---that's a different story.
