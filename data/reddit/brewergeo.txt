Youy dont have the stomache to be an inverstor of any sort. Sell...take your loss so you dont have to wait anymore..otherwise sit on the 28 BTC, stop waiting for the moon and be patient.
edit: did you diversify to hedge your investment?

Wow...5 reasons to turn away from an ATM. well you could walk across the street to another ATM. They are in every convenience store, gas station, grocery store, bank, school, mall, etc.
Now, If for any reason you had problems at the Bicoin ATM, you could go across the state to find another. 
(sorry, I used to be a bitcoin cheerleader and I tried to convince people how convenient it was etc, but the reality for me is that fiat is still much easier to work with.

Its a great way to heat up the room in winter. But you might make more money if you look for spare change in the couch cushions.
