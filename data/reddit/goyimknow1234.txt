You aren't having much of a debate at all.  I'm trying to figure out the positives of open borders, you haven't told me many.

Israel and isis have exact same enemies.

That's why they are perfectly happy that those people are going to Europe.   Israel is supposed to stretch from the Nile to the Ephrates

I realize that.  Can you give me some benefits of open borders and multiculturalism?  Has Sweden gotten stronger as a country since it thew its borders open or is it more divided?  
Please list to me all the non white countries that just open everyone who wants to come with open arms.  I'll wait.. 
Its only brainwashed white liberals and libertarians that think throwing open borders is a good thing.  Everyone else in the world realizes that is a suicidal policy.

Yes countries who have a majority of people of European decent.

You can still keep your country mostly homogenous and have all those things.  Does it make your country stronger to have 100 groups with different cultures living on top of each other constantly offending each other?  No it weakens your country and that is what it is intended to do.

Only white countries are expected to have open borders and are shamed for objecting
@_date: 2015-11-20 00:46:17
No not really.   Again the only borders and cultures that I see are permeable are white countries.   It's deliberate make no mistake.  China isn't opening it's borders,  Japan,  Saudi Arabia,  Israel, Mexico. Etc

Isis has been selling oil for the last few years,  the West made no attempt to stop tha till yesterday.

Because Isrsel is clearing the area so they can expand their borders.   They have been planning on getting rid if Assad and saddam for a very long time.   Notice how isis never attacks Israel,  yet goes for Europeans instead.
