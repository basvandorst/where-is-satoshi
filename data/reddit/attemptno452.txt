Some dollars are backed by confidence.  When the USD was detached from gold the price of gold rose due to the creation of more dollars.  An ounce of gold could still buy a nice suit but more dollars were now required to buy the suit.  Actually I have no idea if the price of suits increased to match the dollar value of an ounce of gold at the time.
Russia and China like gold I have been led to believe by stories of the USD being replaced as the reserve currency.  So Putin likes dollars that are backed by something.  That something being gold.
USD has a lot of confidence.  I think it's accepted all over the world.  Everybody knows what a USD is am I right or No?

its impressive that you guys actually go back through the comments.  you are all paying attention which is hard to do as this is a nonstop stream.  bitcoin in any fork or form is changing by the minute...or the price at least.  bitcoin has been a window and a playground for people like myself, i suspect if i am an example, who never really paid much attention before.  it has sometimes gotten my brain to thinking....past experience tells me that many of my thoughts will be proven wrong to me afterwards.  so it comes as little surprise when it happens...often!
thanks to everybody for making my brain work.  or at least try to.  it is a rewarding way to pass some time.
what is this money that many of us just take for granted?  why might it be that well intentioned social programs can have the opposite effect.  as i said i am very amateur.  i only just discovered Milton.  whether that line of thought be right or wrong that is where i am at in level of awareness.

bitcoin will win by showing working examples of lightning or convincing everyone that is really is coming soon
current lightning propaganda is too dry for common dummies like myself...i tried watching some explanations today but will again tomorrow
even better would be a working example that i could pick up and use
i really need it spelled out for me... like this... l i g h t n i n g
it was like trying to comprehend someone explaining how quantum mechanics works...which ive tried to do with little success
its just average people buying bitcoin now....me...my sister...my mom
mom said dinner was great btw

now that i started paying attention a bit i dont know that their is any
everything is slanted in some way.  every reddit post has a motive or an angle.  post that are just links to other news articles have titles that cherry pick content and or are misleading
probably if even you attempted to write unbiased news you would unconciously slant it
Math Breaking News!!!! 3+1=4
i dont know how but im sure someone could find a way to slant that to their own end

Please feel free to correct, make fun of, and shoot down what I have written here.
Topic:  How many Tim Hortons coffee chain drive throughs can Bitcoin(pre-lightning) transact without creating a backlog?
Assumptions: 1) bitcoin does 7tx/second.  2) no other traffic is trying to use the blockchain.
I am sitting in my vehicle after having gotten a tripple tripple (can this be good for me?) and am parked such that I can count the other customers coming out of the drive through.
Vehicle count=9
Elapsed time=5min 43sec
about 7pm in the evening today
This Tim Hortons drive through is processing 9customers/343seconds or about 0.026 customers per second.  So at the Bitcoin(pre-lightning) speed of 7tx/sec then 269 Tim Hortons can be serviced without building up a backlog of unconfirmed transactions on the blockchain.
Total Locations: 4613
Canadian Locations: 3802
Population of Canada: 36 million
Population of Earth: 7.442 billion or 7442 million
State of Lightning: Unfinished and unreleased
Hopefulness level on the future of Lightning: I'm holding
Chapter Two: Bitcoin Cash
8mb Blocks Currently: 7tx/sec x 8 = 58tx/sec
Tim Hortons Served: 58 ÷ 0.026 = 2521 Tim Hortons drive throughs
Canadian Tim Hortons Locations: 3802 .... BCH can serve at present 2521 locations
Lets ramp it up a bit.... let me assume that everybody loves Tim Hortons as much as Canada.
thats 785,957 Tim Hortons locations worldwide if that were true
785,957 ÷ 2521 = 311 8mb blocks or 311 x 8 = 2494mb blocks
BCH would require blocks 2494mb in size to serve worldwide Tim Hortons drive throughs assuming that Tim Hortons became as popular worldwide as it is in Canada.
2.494Gb blocks
1Tb harddrive: 1000 ÷ 2.49 = 401 BCH blocks to fill this hardrive
how many of these harddrives filled in one year? How many blocks are in one year? 1 x 6 x 24 x 365 = 52,560
52560 ÷ 401 = 131 of these harddrives will be filled in one year
131 harddrives x $100 each = $13,100 dollars
BCH Level.  Holding
Edit: I should say that if maxed out currently BCH would only require 1 of those hard drives per year...I think.

my small taste of the money has shown me that money does not equal happiness...and that i could ruin my childrens lives by giving them too much .... so as a result they can have my money later not earlier in life.
and i do intend to leave them some because there is a difference between money not bringing happiness and starving

the electricity was there for those countries to use before bitcoin came along
electricity is used for many things that you might consider wasteful and you use electricity for things that others might consider wasteful
more important waste is human effort.  why do we spend all that effort making movies in hollywood?  wouldnt that effort be better spent ?

nothing has changed.  crypto is still being worked on and improved by hardworking smart and enthsiastic people.  this recent price spike and drop really has nothing to do with my longterm view.  a bunch of people fomo'd and panic sold. money exchanged hands.  not really my problem.  thats my outlook

Wild Price Estimates Below:
Assumptions included: 1% of existing gold is used and the other 99% is a store of wealth. dollars are in USD. total bitcoins equal approx 16,500,000 btc
1) Western Union 
$80Billion moved,
268Million customer to customer tx,
523Million business payment tx,
791Million tx/year,
If Bitcoin did what Western Union does but limited by pre-segwit and pre-lightning to 7tx/second.
7tx/s x $101 x 60 x 60 x 24 x 365 = $22,295,952,000/year
$22,295,952,000 ÷ 16,500,000 btc = $1351/btc
Assuming 99% of btc stored as wealth.
$22,295,952,000 ÷ 165,000 btc = $135,126/btc
2) Assume Bitcoins sole purpose is coffee purchases at the Bitcoin Coffee Shop.  This is pre-segwit pre-lightning btc.  Also it is still traded, used as a store of wealth and the blocks are perfectly full at 7tx/second.
Coffees are worth $2 each.
7tx/s x $2 x 60 x 60 x 24 x 365 = $441,504,000/year
$441,504,000 ÷ 16,500,000 = $26/btc
Assuming  99% store of wealth = $2695/btc
3) Assume Bitcoins only purpose is to serve the darkmarkets.  I have been led to believe that darkmarket annual sales are $100,000,000.
$100,000,000 ÷ 16,500,000 = $6/btc
Assuming 99% store of value = $606/btc
4) Assume that post Lightning Bitcoin is working as intended.  Venezuela has adopted Bitcoin.
Venezuela 2016 gdp is approx $236Billion
$236,000,000,000 ÷ 16,500,000 btc = $14,303/btc
Assuming 99% store of wealth = $1,403,303/btc

thank you.  im still quite confused on velocity of money.  i take it to mean that if a gdp is 100 dollars that it doesnt take 100 dollars to operate the economy.  so right now ive read that USD velocity in the USA is about 1.5 ?
including velocity of money would lower my bitcoin price estimates i think?

Bitcoin has been selling itself, by means of lying by omission, all along.  Omitting that it is an unfinished product that is currently unable to live up to its hype and omitting that lightning may be years from finished.
I fricken love bitcoin but thems is the cold hard truth.

Bitcoin.  Some software made by some people.  None is forced to use it.  Yet now it is a threat to central banks just by its existence apparently.  Lmao.  A few disruptive lines of code that continue to amaze me.
