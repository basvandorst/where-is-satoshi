so... solution for Bitcoin to truly scale is centralizing it by having huge blocks
LN seems like a band-aid solution... like you said transactions will eventually need to be settled... it's not like everything will be off chain at all times...

I actually typed that out into my original response, but deleted it. :P I do believe Ethereum is very solid, and a much better pick for the future. I think IOTA has a lot more room to grow, and I will be definitely be allocating more of my IOTA profits into ETH, but I am bullish on both longterm.

cuz coordinator. but, it has actually ran without it and it's optional for full nodes to reference it. it's the training wheels the system uses while it ramps up akin to what Bitcoin had when it first started. right now they're working on creating a distributed coordinator to help guide the system until there are sufficient concurrent transactions to have a secure network

Yeah... it get messy... I've spent days just reading/watching/breathing about distributed ledger technologies. I am honestly not confident the Lightning Network will solve all of Bitcoin's scalability problems, which is why I am heavily in IOTA. I know IOTA has its own issues. Bitcoin has security without scalability. IOTA could have security holes since it has not been battle proven for years, however its scales indefinitely until capped by the speed of light. I still hold some Bitcoin and other blockchain tech since you know... I could be wrong.
I haven't tried crypto hedge funds... but I would highly consider that if I didn't feel like understanding everything, but still wanted exposure to this market. There's just so much stuff going on and rapidly changing...
