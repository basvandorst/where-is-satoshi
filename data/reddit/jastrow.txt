So a guy is trying to convince me to dump the USB mining stuff and go with a 180Gh device that is network based and needs a power supply for ~$500 bucks.  At current I have several thousand invested in this junk I have blinking on and off in my office.  That would be almost double when my current rig would put out.  I am just trying to decide to follow the rabbit deeper into the hole or dump all this crap on ebay and say foo!
Further thoughts?

Actually leaning closer to .2, but have not transferred the last .05 over from the pool.  In many ways I agree, the more I learn the more I am discovering that the buy in time passed some time back.  That is fine, as I said it started as an experiment, just for the hell of it.  Thing is that the amount of cash I have invested in hardware (some from here, some from there, etc...) is becoming substantial and thus my dilemma....continue to invest $$$ in more hardware or walk away.  The fun part has passed and I do believe this is a model for the future.

Started as a what is all this about experiment.  Started with a cpu and graphics card, then a couple of usb miners and just kept growing.  Was fun for a while.  So now I am at a point where either I find a way to turn a profit or I walk away.

I have no desire to just buy bitcoins.  I have no use for them...If I dump the stuff I am out.
I was looking for a way to generate some side cash....invest in equipment to generate some bitcoins then cash them out every so often based on market trends for actual money that can be used in everyday life.

That is what I saw, which is why I asked the question.  I stopped using them because I moved on to large standalone units.  Yea, I will post the lot of them for a few bucks to see what someone says.
