Toronto. I am afraid I cant go past the security downstairs. I have already been to the place. I have got the papers and I have another 6 months to serve the notice.

How do we serve the papers? I am sure the person absconded already - can we just mail the above address??

You mean a complaint number?
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:47:47
If you are situated in Canada we could go together and give the complaint.

Hi, Will do that tomorrow. Could you please let me know how did you get the address, I am just curious. 
Look for a fan noise? do you think he is running some miners? Anyway I would go and see if someone is living in this place and let you know.

Any idea what our next steps shud be? I am all ears if someone has some suggestions.

Hi, I am scammed too. Bought a miner for 5K CAD. Please let me know if there is smtg we could do together

Interesting! How long ago was this email?

I found this link to file a complaint in consumer protection.
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:03:05
I don't think so. They would ask us to report to cops.

Went to this place yesterday. Security made calls to the owner and confirmed Bitcoinware does not operate in this unit. They cant allow us to see the Suite though

You and I are in a similar situation. I live in Toronto though. Let me know if I could do something.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:17:32
Thank you for your reply. I have reported to CAFC couple of months ago as soon as I realised that this is a scam.

Unfortunately I do not think that is the picture of the guy from bitcoinware. I think someone took a picture at expo and bitcoinware used it. Check the following link

hmm. We have some name and some address. Can we go to the police? I think they wont be of much help either. If we have some friends in law agencies, they might be able to help.
