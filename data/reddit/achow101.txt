I am defending them because I think logically and rationally. I look for proof and specific citations that indicate that what someone has done is illegal. As such, I fight against people who jump to conclusions because they THINK that something is happening, when in fact the law may state otherwise. I fight against people who do not prove anything but simply make statements because that is what they think or feel. I fight against people like the OP who say things and claim that they are true without providing any specific citations or evidence that they are correct. I follow the principle of innocent until proven guilty. No one has provided such conclusive evidence (by citing laws) to say that Bitfinex is criminal.
If someone is going to claim something, then the burden of proof is on them to prove that their claim is true, and I have not yet seen anyone prove that their claims are true, just that the claims are true based upon what they think is supposed to be true.
By specific citations, I mean citing an actual law and links to said law which states that what Bitfinex has done is illegal.
I am, of course, doing research myself, but the burden of proof should not be on me but rather the persons making the claims.

Because the transaction with the smaller fee is seen first, thus your double spending transaction is rejected, even with a higher fee.
To use RBF, you have to opt in by setting the nSequence of at least one of the inputs to MAX_INT - 2. Otherwise nodes will reject the double spend.
The reason that double spending with a higher fee sometimes works is that the low fee transaction has a fee that is so low that the transaction itself is rejected by nodes in the first place. Your fee may not be that low.

It could be for proving that the file exists and hasn't been modified since its upload.


It can be hard to organize and automate. In order for any payment to be made, all 15 parties would have to sign the transaction, and that could be a problem to organize. Of course, the software could automate it by automatically signing any transaction it receives, but then that runs into some abuse issues where it could be possible for someone to steal the other people's funds. However, if the parties are chosen correctly (people who are online at around the same time, same location, make your own channel, etc.) then it could work very well. And with alerts and doing things in batches, it can also be done very well.
The major pro is that it will significantly reduce the amount of transactions that need to be created. It also makes it so that multiple people can be paid at the same time.


Well for opening the channel, each user would send the server a public key, the server would generate the address, and then the user would get that address and send funds to it to fund the channel. So there would not necessarily be a reduction for opening the channel, although there could be with a centralized service that created the transaction and passed it around to the parties, much like a CoinJoin transaction. If that happened, then there would be a significant reduction.
The major benefit here is with closing the channel. Instead of closing 14 channels with 14 transactions, this channel with 14 people can be closed with 1 transaction, thus reducing the number of transactions.


Kind of. So this isn't really documented and looked into, but I imagine it would be something like this: a separate transaction is created that sends one person's (or however many are leaving at that time) Bitcoin to their address, and the other output of that transaction is to a new multisig address where the public keys with the remaining people in that channel (maybe they can add new people). Then after the transaction is broadcast and confirmed, the channel makes the next commitment tx breaking up the remaining funds to the people remaining in the channel. Basically a new payment channel.


It would be less than 14 since the funding transactions are still independent (actually, if it is megaupload paying uploaders, then it is a factor of 14). The tx size would be considerably smaller for closing the channel


Multisig only goes up to 15 because the highest OP counting number is OP_15.

Bitcoin Core can accept uncompressed private keys. It accepts the Wallet Import Format. Keys that begin with a '5', 'K', or 'L' are all WIF keys. '5' keys are uncompressed, the other two are compressed. They are all the same format and Bitcoin Core is able to accept all of these.
There is no way to easily convert between compressed and uncompressed keys since the different types of keys will result in two different addresses.

And then people will start bitching about how they can't get their money and how bitfinex is holding their money hostage. Then, in the time that it takes for the audit to complete, people start suing them because they can't withdraw and now no one would get any money because it is all tied up in several lawsuits. Is that what you want?


But they are also the only ones that have the experience and knowhow to run that company. This is similar to how the Allies put several Nazi's in charge of Germany after WWII because those Nazi's were the only ones that had the experience and knowhow to run that country.


So would you. It's called self preservation. They need to have that money in order to fight the inevitable lawsuits.
It's a very delicate balance. They want to please their customers but they also need to have money in order to continue to operate.


It would be even worse form for them to give you the money and then take it back in order to fight your lawsuit.
And here's the other thing. Why are you so greedy that you want Bitfinex to give you as much money as possible until they have no money to give out, and then further sue them to get them to give you more money that they don't even have.
This just seems to me to be acting out of malice and on the same level of bad faith that you are claiming Bitfinex is acting.


Can you cite me any laws or regulations that show that what Bitfinex has done is illegal?

They run at least one full node. If you figure out what its IP address is, you can connect to it with your node and thus be able to directly send transactions to them.

Audit's aren't instantaneous. They can take from a few weeks to a few months to complete. You can't expect them to have completed a full audit in the 9 days since the hack.


How would that help? The current management are the ones who know about the ins and outs of the company. AFAICT, the company is fairly small, so a new management would consist of people who have not worked at bitfinex before or don't know enough about the ins and outs of the company to actually be helpful.


They could definitely do that, but aren't there regulations that prevent them from immediately doing so?


Can you explain why they shouldn't do that? Keep in mind that they are a company and they want to keep the company afloat and not go bankrupt. People are going to sue them regardless, so they need to have money in order to deal with that. Would you rather that they start taking money from customers to pay for legal stuff when it happens or just put aside money for legal action? 
Those $7 mil were probably earmarked for legal action anyways.


Investigations take a long time. There is surely a lot of data to sift through considering the volume of outgoing transactions during the hack.


How would that be helpful at all? If they don't know how the hack happened, then who do they fire?
@_date: 2016-08-28 18:56:37


Yes. In fact, many sites do. It is one of many things that you should check for before accepting an unconfirmed transaction.


Yes. A peer can request a transaction from its peers. If the a peer doesn't have a transaction, it will respond with a notfound.

Right, so it is the first thing I said. The transaction was rejected by nodes because it conflicted with the original transaction. If the original transaction has already confirmed, then the mutated transaction will always be rejected by other nodes.
@_date: 2016-08-27 01:08:50
Your question is hard to understand. Are you asking why you didn't see the mutated transaction, or why the original transacition did not change.
For the first, it would be because most nodes rejected your transaction since it is considered a double spend.
For the second, it is because the transaction is an entirely separate transaction. You cannot "update" or change a transaction, doing so creates an entirely new transaction.
@_date: 2016-08-07 01:33:44


Actually you can't. The keys aren't the same for every address. AFAIK a new key was generated for each address, probably using BIP32 HD keys to do so.

There is a lot of ambiguity and assumptions being made here. 
First of all, we don't even know what he means by "linked to a tiny Bitcoin micro transaction". This could mean that every upload could be hashed, then that hash put into an OP_RETURN output of a transaction and broadcast. This would mean that there would be tons of spam transactions with lots of OP_RETURN outputs. The logical solution would be to have him roll all of this transactions into one transaction with tons of OP_RETURN outputs. That would help his business by paying less transaction fees and also allow him to not completely wreck the network. But on the other hand that would mean that that transaction is non-standard and might not get confirmed. Not that it would really matter though.
Or, as you interpret it, it could mean that he uses payment channels and pays the uploaders. You assume that they would be two-party bidirectional payment channels. This is not necessarily the case. Since these just utilize multisig  it doesn't have to be two parties, it can actually go up to 15 parties. This can get a little hard to manage, but given that the service will have some level of centralization and with some good programming and automation, it is certainly possible to have 15 party payment channels, significantly reducing the amount of potential traffic.
Furthermore, by utilizing multiple multisig addresses in one transaction, you could theoretically be having a huge amount of parties in a single payment channel. The only issues are that there would have to be a significant amount of coordination, probably some batching of payments in order to make this work well and that the closing transactions would have huge amount of sigops. Of course, segwit would fix the massive amount of hashing that would need to be done, but they may run into the sigop limit.
@_date: 2016-08-13 03:44:43
It would take infinitely long because all of the hash power is dedicated to performing double sha256 hashes. This hash algorithm is not used for generated any keys for Bitcoin addresses thus it would be useless to do so.
Also, the hash power does not correlate to EC key generation because the time it takes to generate those keys is different from the hash power.

Sure it's possible, but it is also possible to do have done the heist from the outside.
The attacker would have done some studying. He probably studied BitGo's api and architecture beforehand. It isn't private and all of the docs are online, so that isn't hard to do. Furthermore, he could have set up a simple test using BitGo to learn how it works. 
Then for accessing Bitfinex's system, it is possible that the attacker found a 0-day vulnerability in the backend server software that Bitfinex uses and was able to exploit that to either get access into the server or trick the system into thinking that lots of people were withdrawing so the automatic withdrawal system would automatically withdraw the Bitcoin.

It is transmitted with the block. There is a new transaction serialization format, the witness transaction serialization format. This format is specified in  If a node as the NODE_WITNESS service bit set, then it will receive the transactions with witness serialization. It will also receives blocks with transactions with the witness serialization.
The witness data does not count towards the block size. Because it doesn't, the sizes of transactions under the old serialization are reduced and this also reduces the fee that you have to pay.

Yes. It becomes a non-issue after confirmations. Unfortunately, there are services and idiots who still spend and accept unconfirmed transactions.

There is an address format, bech32. Bech32 is not "only a proposal", it is finalized and ready to be used. The listing of Draft status in the BIPs repo does not mean that it is "just a proposal" or that it is "just a draft". Draft means it is not in Final status yet, and Final status is only granted when the BIP is widely used in multiple software. From [BIP 2](


Anyways, you can use P2SH-P2WPKH addresses, and that was the original intent to smooth over the transition. Introducing any new address format is going to be painful (just look at how P2SH was deployed) and difficult to use for several months after deployment, maybe even years.


How are you submitting it to those nodes? Secondly, if the node does not support segwit, of course it won't work. You have to make sure the node that you are using is Bitcoin Core 0.13.1+. Submitting segwit transactions has worked fine for me always.

There are many reasons that some wallet developers have not implemented the payment protocol, the most prominent being that it introduces some rather large dependencies and it is significant development overhead to do so for a feature that is rarely used.
The payment protocol uses Google's protocol buffers, which means that wallet software now must have an additional dependency on protobuf. Then, since it can also use the whole trusted CA thing, wallets must support verifying X.509 certificates and checking up the chain to make sure the request was signed with a trusted certificate (this is the same as with HTTPS). So not only do you have to be able to parse and verify these certificates, but you also have to store the trusted CAs somewhere. And then we now also have to implement a completely separate protocol - HTTPS - in order to even get those payment requests.
All of these additional dependencies require tons of development overhead and can introduce additional dependencies which are rather large and can include security vulnerabilities. Any vulnerability that effects implementation of payment protocol could potentially be a money losing vulnerability. So now you have to be sure that those dependencies are secure, or trust that they are.
All of this overhead and the additional dependencies required is why Armory has not implemented the payment protocol. Those reasons are also why Bitcoin Core is unable to fully get rid of OpenSSL, something which we have been trying to do for a long time. Unfortunately the payment protocol relies on OpenSSL, so we can't get rid of it.

It isn't all about the "fuck bitpay" mentality though. Not all wallets support the payment protocol, such as Armory. For people who use such wallets, migrating to a new wallet which does may be very difficult (to maintain privacy), expensive (if sending transactions, it could be many transactions), and insecure (if importing keys, key leakage). Such people would not be able to pay for things using Bitcoin if the merchant uses Bitpay. This is where this tool comes in handy; it will display the addresses that Bitpay wants the coins sent to so that such users can make the payment without having to migrate wallets.

This is correct. The order of signing does not matter as signatures are never included in the data that is actually signed. What may matter is the order of signatures in an input. For example, multisig inputs require the signatures to be a particular order that matches the order of the public keys.


No, the mempool is not used to distribute the incomplete transactions. There is no defined method for transmitting a PSBT. PSBT is just a file format. PSBT does not involve the network at all.
What PSBT allows you to do is create one blob of data which can be passed between participants in a transaction without requiring all participants to know a bunch of things about that transaction already when they sign. This is particularly useful for things like hardware wallets as a PSBT contains all of the information they need so the software does not need to do additional lookups to find the information necessary for signing.

Non-listening nodes do matter. They *do* broadcast blocks and transactions. They do exactly the same things as listening nodes except that they don't accept incoming connections.

I guess you haven't considered the other problems that come with such a hard fork.
1. At the time of forking, every single unconfirmed transaction would instantaneously be invalidated. Now you need to have wallets be able to handle that instantaneous invalidation, drop those unconfirmed transactions, and make new ones that replace it that follow the old rules. With so many unconfirmed transactions right now, that would be a problem for large wallets (e.g. exchanges) and, depending on how some implement it, a problem for many users.
2. Because all unconfirmed transactions would be invalidated, if you made a timelocked transaction and discarded the private key (as some do), then those coins are lost forever because the timelocked transaction is no longer valid.
3. With a hard fork, all of the guides and information written for doing things with previous versions of Bitcoin Core (and other consensus software) are also now gone. But those original authors are not likely to change their articles and it would be impossible for the developers to go an hunt down every last person who wrote a blog post about compiling Bitcoin Core at version X and get them to take down or change their article. Then newcomers who follow such guides will be confused and potentially end up using a blockchain that few people actually use and think it is Bitcoin. This would be a huge problem. Even now we continuously get confused people who are trying to use outdated versions of BItcoin Core and come asking for help because they followed some old outdated guide on how to compile Bitcoin Core.
For the highway analogy, this is akin to nuking the highway while people are still using it and everything around the highway and then instantaneously rebuilding just the highway. You cause tons of damage and collateral damage that can slowly still effect you and cause problems in the future.

PSBT does not involve the steps where the inputs and outputs of the transaction are negotiated. You cannot combine multiple transactions without all parties involved in those transactions having to resign the new transaction. While you can combine transactions, you would need to have some other protocol to do that.
PSBT only helps with the signing step where you can pass around a PSBT which contains all of the information necessary for signing.

That really is not a solution. It just pushes back the deadline another X blocks. People using old SPV wallets will continue to just make the old format transactions and once you get to block Y where you start enforcing the new transaction format, you get the same problem again.You will basically just have the same problem we have now, but then later run into the same problem that just a hard fork has. It's basically a half assed soft fork.


It isn't that kind of documentation that we are concerned about. Rather the concern is more about Joe Schmoe's blog (or the first edition of Mastering Bitcoin) which tells you to checkout some old version of Bitcoin Core (e.g. 0.9.4) and tells you how to compile it. Then it also tells you how to construct a transaction. But after the hard fork, those things don't apply anymore. But Google and other search engines are still going to give you those outdated posts and such when you search for how to do them, and as a newcomer, you would have no idea that what you are doing doesn't work anymore.

With Opt-in RBF, you can replace that transaction with another one that pays the right fee to get your transaction included in the next Block. CPFP would not allow this, you would be screwed and have to wait.

For me, forking bitcoin.org is motivated by the constant alienation of frequent contributors.
Over the past several years, both Cobra and Will Binns have been doing some things unilaterally that have alienated many frequent contributors. Notably, Will added a donation address to Bitcoin.org which, as far as anyone knows, is one of his personal addresses (no multisig).
Cobra has been unilaterally adding many more things to the website without community agreement, i.e. without a Pull Request. For example, he added a post about Segwit2x which was much too strongly worded that resulted in a lot of backlash against the post and required it to be reverted. Only then was a PR made and the post revised and discussed.
 Most recently, there was the Paxful sponsorship which really acted like an advertisement. It was merged without anyone in the community explicitly ACK'ing it. There have been several other such instances of the maintainers and domain owners taking such unilateral actions. These have driven away contributors and make the site less community maintained and more like someone's personal website.
There is also the fact that many people perceive the primary domain owner, Cobra, to be unstable. People believe that he may turn bitcoin.org into a bcash site, although this is not why I have forked bitcoin.org

It actually is a direct flight. The flight is (probably) along a [Great Circle]( which is the shortest distance between two points on a sphere. When you flatten out the path onto a map, it looks like a huge arc, but on a sphere it's actually a straight line.
As for taking longer or slower, that is due to the [Westerlies]( which blow from West to East in the middle latitudes. So when you are traveling from Atlanta to Spain, you are traveling with a tail wind which causes the aircraft to fly faster and thus take less time. On the way back, you are flying into a headwind as you travel from East to West, so the aircraft flies slower and thus takes more time.

No, hashes apply only to one specific block (or proposed block). That block contains things that are specific to a block at a certain height with a certain parent. If you were to try to reuse the block at a later time when the blockchain has progressed a bit and the difficulty is now lower, then that block would be invalid for the height that you would want to use it at. This is because its parent block (which is directly referenced by including its hash) is not the most recent block. There are also other things in the block that would invalidate it when you would try to use it.

Addresses can be linked by Spend Linking, meaning that a transaction spends from both addresses. Spend linking is really the only reliable way to link addresses together as being part of the same wallet.

Regarding mining, you need to have very cheap electricity. Generally your electricity rate must be below $0.10/kwh. And you must be willing to invest several thousands of dollars into ASIC miners in order to get any result. You may be able to offset the cost of the miners by reducing your heating bill as ASICs do produce a ton of heat.
For wallets, if you have a sufficiently high bandwidth internet connection (&gt; 1 mbps, no or very high data caps), 100+ GB of free hard drive space, and you are willing to wait several hours to download the entire blockchain, then you can use full node software such as Bitcoin Core. If you don't have that much storage space or you don't want to wait several hours and have it eat up a good chunk of your internet connection, you can use a lightweight wallet like Electrum.

And it is still that way.


No it does not. If it did, then it would be a hard fork. Segwit does not touch the block header at all, it only changes transactions.


Not true at all. Blocks won't be split into multiple parts. What segwit does with signatures is it makes a new field in the transaction format itself which contains the signatures, called the txwitness. When a segwit capable node requests a block, it will receive the block with transactions containing the txwitness field. If a node without segwit requests a block, it will receive the block with the txwitness field stripped out of all transactions. The block is not split into multiple parts, and the PoW and transaction scripts can be verified without needing the txwitnesses.


Again, not true. Segwit provides several substantial benefits. It fixes transaction malleability for transactions that spend from segwit outputs. It fixes the quadratic sighashing issue for transactions that spend from segwit outputs. The block weight system will increase the number of transactions that can fit in a block and help to reduce UTXO bloat by incentivising more consumption of UTXOs than the creation of UTXOs.
You really should do your own research instead of listening to what other people tell you (especially those at r/btc). I highly suggest that you read and understand the BIPs ([141]( [143]( [144]( that specify Segwit on a technical level before making arguments about the technical aspects of segwit. Furthermore, several people have made posts about. A good place to start would be the [segwit benefits ]( and [segwit costs and risks]( articles on bitcoincore.org.

Great, thanks for the clarification.
Core will still end up verifying more blocks than Classic would since the assumevalid block is already several weeks old. Also, another big difference is that you can choose to verify every single block by setting assumevalid to 0, which is an improvement over Classic and checkpoints.

I thought it was clear that you can choose to use BU or Core depending on what node you run locally for Armory to connect to. If you want to use the Core chain, run Bitcoin Core.

As I understand it, assumevalid has a default value which is, in theory, in the longest chain. Since Bitcoin Core does headers first sync, it will have all of the block headers and figured out which chain is the longest by the time it gets to verifying the blocks fully and can thus check whether the block it is validating is an ancestor of the assumevalid block.


That block is not part of the assumevalid chain and is thus fully checked.
@_date: 2017-03-06 05:07:49


Then the assumevalid block is irrelevant. It is only used for syncing up to and including itself. After that, normal full validation is done.


There are two differences.
1. The assumevalid block is not required to be a part of the main chain. With checkpoints, three checkpoints had to be part of the valid chain.
2. The assumevalid block can be any block you want, or no block at all to force full validation.

Both transactions could each spend from an output that was mined after the fork on their respective chains.

Actually any client prior to 0.8 will not be able to sync the blockchain. Although the explicit limit was added in 0.3.x, there was actually an implicit limit caused by a bug in the software which limited the block size to ~500 kb and caused an accidental chain fork in 2013. So actually BU is not "going back to the orignal rules" but rather introducing new ones.
Furthermore, the entire Bitcoin community has decided that this "fork" of Bitcoin after 0.3.x is "Bitcoin". Since BU would be using a different set of consensus rules different from what is currently "Bitcoin", unless basically every user decides to call BU "Bitcoin", the "Bitcoin" will still be the longest blockchain following the current consensus rules.

No. It will by default do all verification until it has built a chain of block headers which includes the assumevalid block and that headers chain contains the block headers of the longest possibly valid blockchain. So if the node has not received a chain of block headers including the assumevalid block header, it will still do full verification of all the blocks. As soon as it does receive the block header of the assumevalid block, it will check if the block it is verifying is an ancestor (i.e. an earlier block) of the assumevalid block, and if it is, it will skip the script verification. If the block it is verifying is a descendant of the assumevalid block (i.e. a later block), it will do all script verification checks as usual.

Native addresses allow for smaller transactions since the segwit outputs don't need to go into the inputs of the spending transaction.
As for other functionality, I don't think it was so much as native addresses allowing for more functionality but rather some initial confusion about how to implement spending to segwit. I don't think it was very clear at first that we were supposed to use p2sh nested outputs so we (well at least I) was kinda confused as to how people were going to make segwit outputs without some sort of address scheme.

You wouldn't necessarily have to update in order to take advantage of both chains. In the case of a BU fork, you just need to have a copy your Core blockchain and Armory databases in order to work on both chains. The document in the OP (once it finalizes and is actually posted to the website) basically outlines what you have to do. Should a fork actually occur, we will make posts on the Armory forums and on the website (and probably here as well) with step by step instructions on what to do to use both blockchains or to switch to use a specific blockchain.
@_date: 2017-03-05 23:34:03
IIRC what Classic did was have it not check any signatures until blocks 24 hours behind current time. This does not check signatures up to a specific block in the blockchain, similar to checkpoints. But unlike checkpoints, it is not locked into using a chain with that specific block.
You can also set your own assumevalid block so if you want super fast syncing, you can set it to be the current block according to a block explorer instead of a block that could be several months behind.

Again, no, that is not true. Validating the header does not require the witness commitment from the coinbase transaction. The PoW validates just fine with only the block header. The witness commitment is not needed in order to validate the header.


What do you mean by "incomplete"? A block without the witnesses can still be validated for everything except the signatures of segwit transactions. That means that the PoW can be validated, the scripts can be validated for correctness, the inputs of transactions are checked, the merkle root is checked, etc. A block without the witnesses will always be less than 1 MB. With the witnesses, it can be up to 4 MB.


Except what you are claiming were inherently technical things. Claiming that the block header has changed or the format of blocks has changed is arguing a technical specific of Segwit, and you should not argue technical specifics without reading and understanding the technical specifics of the proposal.

It would take up more space on disk to maintain filters for every block. But this is largely a non-issue because it is highly likely that the filters will be computed and stored locally in order to help Bitcoin Core's wallet do rescans faster. It is possible that the network change may not be included (there is disagreement about it) but the filters themselves I think are not controversial.

What are you taking about? The default confirmation target was TWENTY FIVE (25). That's 4 hours, not ten minutes. The fee estimation has never been set to default to 10 minutes ever since it was introduced.
@_date: 2017-03-07 00:32:56
Because there will still be two chains. 75% is not everybody, it is 75% of the hashrate that supports BU. There is still that 25%, and if bitnodes' data is accurate (which is questionable because node counts are never accurate), 52% of the nodes supports segwit, not to mention all of the nodes running old versions of Core too. That means that there will be, for at least a brief period of time, multiple blockchains supported by different groups both calling themselves Bitcoin. This is going to be a huge problem for businesses and exchanges that accept Bitcoin because which Bitcoin is "real"? Which blockchain do I look for for confirmations? among many other logistical problems this could cause for businesses.
While there will be warning, there will still be people who don't switch, and that is not likely to be an insignificant amount of people.

I would say that is probably due to the fee estimation "warm up" time since it needs to receive a bunch of blocks (25 I think) before being accurate.


I know that Bitcoin Core and Armory both have RBF in the works, and Electrum has had RBF for a while now and will actually warn you if the fee is too low and ask you to enable RBF for that transaction. However, I do agree that a lot of wallets need to work on getting RBF and CPFP functionality, especially online wallets and exchanges. Blockchain.info and coins.ph really need to get their shit together (especially bc.i since so many people use them).

It will use whatever chain your underlying node follows. If you use Core, you will be using the Core chain, even if it is shorter, because the longer chain is not accepted by Core. If you use BU, you will be using the BU chain because BU will have accepted the longer chain. Armory won't be able to switch back to the Core chain if you use BU, you would have to run Core again and maintain a separate Core blockchain and Armory database directory for Core.

Most wallets do not make it easy for you to increase the fee of your transaction. It can become fairly complicated to get your wallet to allow spending from unconfirmed outputs or to forget an unconfirmed transaction and then resend it. Even if they were able to do so, the peers connected to that client may reject the RBF transaction as a double spend. 
This software works around all of that. It is not necessary to have it forget transactions because it doesn't store them. The necessary transaction are produced in the program and are broadcast to a large number of nodes to get the transaction as widespread as possible.
As for the fees, having to download the blockchain and calculate the optimal fee from that is an extra overhead, also requiring that the blockchain be downloaded. For something that is supposed to work quickly, using an API is much faster.

Double Click the FeeBooster.jar file and then enter the raw hex of your transaction (get that by adding "?format=hex" without the quotes to the end of the blockchain.info link for the transaction). Then click next and set your new fee, deducting from the output that you want to deduct from. Then click next and you get the unsigned transaction. You copy that unsigned transaction and go to Tools &gt; Load Transaction &gt; From Text in Electrum and paste in the unsigned transaction. Sign it in Electrum.

If you use Bitcoin Core, when you send your Bitcoin, click on the "Choose" button next the Transaction Fee at the bottom. Then select the "Recommended" radio button and move the slider all the way to the right to get the fastest fee. It is also a good idea to have had Bitcoin Core running for ~30 minutes before sending so that it can analyze and determine the best fee.
Or you can lookup the best fee per Kb and set that manually yourself.
If you have a stuck transaction, you can use my Fee Booster:  Extract it and run the FeeBooster.jar file. Simply follow the instructions, although where it says that you can enter a txid, you actually can't. You can only enter the raw hex of a transaction. The program generates an unsigned transaction that is either an RBF transaction or a CPFP transaction. You sign that unsigned transaction in your wallet and then you can broadcast it from my program.

The transaction fee has nothing to do with the value of your transaction but rather the size of the transaction in bytes (because the transaction is data). If you are spending from many outputs (e.g. micropayments from faucets), then the size of your transaction will be quite larger. If you spend from few outputs (e.g. one large output), then the size will be smaller. The value of those outputs does not matter.

Contrary to popular belief, the limit is not actually 21 Million, and that constant is never coded anywhere in Bitcoin's consensus. Rather, every 210000 blocks, the block reward is halved. This continues until the block reward is nearly zero, at which point the reward is then simply rounded down to zero because it is so small. This continuous halving results in 20999999.97690000 BTC which rounds up to 21 million BTC.
This can be changed through a hard fork, and only a hard fork. It is a consensus rule and as soon as any change to it is introduced, it must be a hard fork because the fixed schedule is hard coded into every node.
As a side note, the supply was actually originally infinite and would repeat every 140 years due to some undefined behavior in C++. This was fixed with BIP 42  and  which sets the block reward to 0 at block 13,440,000

They would give a more hateful answer also filled with false information. Just go read r/btc for a little bit.
The other arguments (and their debunking) that frequently come up are:
* It's untested (But it actually has had lots of testing over nearly a year)
* It's a hack and kludgy (The only Hack happening is including the witness commitment in an output of the coinbase instead of the header)
* It's better to deploy as a hard fork (There are actually 3 arguments here. 1 - witness commitment in header: it isn't any more efficient or better than doing as a soft fork. 2 - redefine the txid algo to exclude signatures: breaks any and all unconfirmed transactions prior to the fork. 3 - use flexible transactions: it actually doesn't have sufficient testing and it isn't specifically defined in any document yet.)

Armory has its own database. It does not require the full node to use a special index. Armory can and does work off of Bitcoin Core using default settings.
Most sync performance issues are usually due to disk io or CPU performance. Increasing dbcache will improve sync performance a lot as per disk io is done with a higher dbcache. After that, using an SSD will also increase sync performance. There also a CPU bottleneck as all of these validation things need CPU. Network performance is almost never a problem.

Of the 17 people listed on  only 5 work for Blockstream and only one of them has commit access. None of them are maintainers of the project. It is simply not true that Bitcoin Core's development is run by a for profit corporation.


Oh, how so? Their primary product is Liquid, which is a sidechain for exchanges that has nothing to do with small blocks whatsoever. Lightning is not dependent on small blocks either and may in fact need larger blocks anyways if there is a significant amount of channels opening and closing.


theymos is not associated with Core in any way, shape, or form. In fact some of the core devs (those who are active on reddit and bitcointalk, e.g. Greg) have spoken out against censorship and harsh moderation in the past.


Except development. Development of classic and BU are not decentralized at all. Both are doing significantly less development and less process for reviewing changes and merging them. Both also have the maintainers committing their changes directly to the main git tree, something that should be avoided. The maintainers of those projects have significant central power over the direction of those projects.
Additionally both have imposed other limits, something that would be considered central planning. And BU has refused to even attempt to work with the long-standing BIP process to even attempt to work with all of the other developers who also follow BIPs but doesn't give a shit about BUIPs (hint: it's much more than Core that follows the BIP process).
Anyways, this is Off topic.

No. The final maximum sequence alert which displays a static "Alert key compromised" message cannot be overridden. This means that no alert can cancel it and no alert can replace it.

No. There is really no other way to do it. The only ways to kill off the alert system is to either get everyone to use software that has removed it (not likely) or to broadcast the maximum sequence alert which cannot be overridden which makes the alert system unusable.

In the opening section of his post, he calls a block size increase fork a "no brainer" and "pretty simple". This argument though has massive holes in it and completely misses all of the nuance and consequences of raising the block size limit and the deployment of such a fork.
The "censorship" of clients implementing contentions hard forks (XT, Classic) is because theymos considers those clients to be altcoin clients. This is because they implement a contentious hard fork (i.e. does not have broad consensus) and thus follows different consensus rules. The key idea here is that compatibility is not the same has following the exact same rules. Furthermore, because it is a hard fork, it completely changes the consensus rules and thus would become an altcoin should it fork and two forks of the Bitcoin blockchain exist afterwards.
One common thing cited in that post are the number of points that a thread or post has. However, it is a well known fact that vote manipulation by r/btc'ers has and potentially continues to take place, thus making those points not representative of the actual voting opinions of users here at r/bitcoin.
The article also tends to attribute the actions of one moderator to be the collective agreed upon actions of all moderators. This is obviously incorrect as is even stated in one of the screenshots. This also contradicts (what I believe is) theymos' view on moderator actions, the mods can interpret the rules as they see fit. Moderator actions do not necessarily represent what all mods believe and follow.
Take some things with a grain of salt, such as where is quoting what banned users have said regarding the circumstances around their ban. Obviously most of those users will be pissed off and they may (probably) not be explaining everything that actually happened and may be paraphrasing or taking out of context statements made by mods in order to make their position seem more credible.
Re-read the article and keep in mind the rules of this subreddit and that clients implementing hard forks (XT, Classic, Unlimited) are considered altcoins. Especially keep in mind the rule that altcoin discussions are not allowed. Then most of the mods actions will make sense.

It's mostly a psychological thing. People will look at 70 commits and go "gee, that's a lot of commits, I don't feel like reviewing that right now" and the PR will just never get sufficient review. There's also the issue that about half of those commits fail the tests and this makes it more difficult to review. Failing tests also breaks `git bisect` which makes it harder to find out where a bug was introduced.


Commits that are too large are also too difficult to review.
The goal is to reduce the number of commits by combining all of the implementation commits (the ones adding things to `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan`) with their respective integration (the ones that change `CWallet` to call things in `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan`) without also breaking tests.


That's definitely a concern. However, the couple of people who are most likely to review this PR have asked me to do this as it will make it easier for them to review (in theory). Given the current lack of comments, I suspect that few people have actually begun reviewing it, which is why I am choosing to rewrite history.
Also, a lot of the changes will remain the same. The final diff should be, for the most part, identical. The only changes will be to commit order and where a change was introduced.

The metadata is part of the money. There are many times where not having the metadata means that you don't really have the money.
For example, suppose you are sending multiple transactions in a row, let's say, 6. You have a backup of your seed. After you send the first three transactions, your hard drive suddenly fails and restore from your seed to a new computer. Now you have a problem. You don't know what inputs you spent from for those three unconfirmed transactions since you don't have the metadata.
Furthermore, suppose you are trying to maintain some semblance of anonymity by separating your addresses (i.e. not spending certain addresses together to not have them spend linked). You restored from your seed but you don't know which of those addresses you marked to spend together and which not.
Thus the metadata can be quite important and having just the private keys is not everything. Without the metadata, you may not be able to spend your money as privately, quickly, or securely as you want.

You don't need to store every private key because you will be able to regenerate them if you know the derivation path. You will need store a public key to derivation path mapping in order to know what the derivation path for a public key is.


No, that is not possible. You can only sign with the individual, derived private keys. While you do not need to store every private key, you will need to know how to derive it from the master private key.


For privacy. It is recommended practice to always generate a new address for both change and receiving. This is for privacy as people sending you Bitcoin won't know how much Bitcoin you have, and people receiving Bitcoin from you won't be able to find out how much Bitcoin you have. By using a new address every time, there are no other transactions or transaction history for people to really look at so it helps preserve your privacy.
It is also not wasteful and it really doesn't cost anything to use a new address for every receive and change.


To neuter a key just means to turn a private-public keypair into just a public key. It's basically just dropping the private key and keeping only the public key. This is useful when fetching a key (from storage, or just generating a new one). The private key can be stored somewhere safely, then deleted from memory via `Neuter()` while the same key object remains and could be passed around (i.e. no need to make a duplicate pubkey object and then delete the original).
As an aside, the things you have asked have basically nothing to do with BIP 44. You're asking about how HD works itself, and that is BIP 32. BIP 44 is separate and describes a "canonical" derivation path scheme.

This should make the fork happen more cleanly (unlike with bcash) although this stuff is partially things that 2x should be going themselves instead of relying on others.
These changes have taken a significant amount of time during which we did not work on the segwit wallet.

That's not true. Luke is certainly in favor a larger block size, just not right now. Contrary to popular belief, he is in support of increasing the maximum block size in the future. He even tried proposing a [BIP]( that would do so but just rather slowly. He believes that the network right now cannot handle larger blocks, or for that matter, the current size of blocks. But that does not mean that he is not in favor of increasing the block size in the future when technology is better and the network can handle larger blocks.

The changes in 0.15.1 are several networking changes so that nodes can handle the upcoming Segwit2x fork better. We have improved the disconnection logic to ensure that we are always on the latest chain and to kick peers that we know are using a different chain (low work, chain with invalid blocks, etc). There are also several bug fixes in this release as well.

That is not correct and it is disingenuous to say that it is an increase to 2 MB blocks. Segwit already brings us to 4 MB blocks. The accurate thing to say would be that Segwit2x doubles the maximum block weight to 8 million units which has a maximum block size of 8 MB.

How do you know? The point of covert asicboost is that it is covert, you can use asicboost without any indication that you are using it. There is no difference in the hardware  or firmware implementations of overt and covert asicboost; they do the same thing, just that the preprocessing is different.

Not every miner has admitted to not using it either. Even if Bitmain doesn't that doesn't mean that other miners haven't gotten their hands on the asicboost supporting firmware or written custom firmware that supports asicboost. Not every miner and mining hardware manufacturer has stated they are not using asicboost on the mainnet.
Furthermore, why would Bitmain include asicboost hardware in products in mass production if they aren't going to use it?

I have analyzed the code and I have determined how this is happening and most likely why it was put there.
First, let's start with the how. The firmware will [spawn a thread]( which calls the [send_mac function]( which, as the name implies, [sends data]( about the machine to the [AUTH_URL auth.minerlink.com]( The device then will attempt to [receive data from the server]( and check if the response is [false]( If it is, the function returns true which sets the [stop_mining global variable]( to be true.
When that variable is true, in the temperature checking thread, it will set the [status_error global variable]( to true. That will then tell the [work update function]( to [not send out jobs]( so it is no longer mining.
Now for the why.
Bitmain previously was going to launch a service called Minerlink. This service never launched, but it was intended get the ["real-time miner status remotely"]( There is probably a feature that allows you to make sure that the only miners submitting work for you are your miners, hence the need for an auth url. It is also possible that another feature was to allow you to remotely stop a machine from mining if it were misbehaving. This would explain why this code was put there in the first place. However, since minerlink does not exist, this functionality is now a liability and should have been removed long ago.

I don't think you have looked too much into disassembling machine code, have you? Sure it isn't trivial to do, but there are tools available such as IDA PRO and radare2 which are designed to disassemble machine code. Reading and interpreting the assembly code as to what it is doing isn't exactly trivial, but it isn't an impossible task. There are entire industries focused around disassembling machine code and reverse engineering software, firmware, and hardware. It certainly is not an impossible task and it is not really that hard to do if you know assembly.

Asicboost has been known for a long time by now and, IIRC, was independently discovered by multiple people. However I don't think there was much discussion about it until now since there was no evidence that anyone was actually using asicboost in production. Now that someone has gone through the effort of reverse engineering private firmware and hardware of Bitmain's products, we know that asicboost is implemented in production hardware and thus there is a concern that it is being used by some miners to gain an unfair advantage over other miners. It's a more pressing and talked about issue now because it is suspected to be in use, whereas previously it was only theorized.

The relevant part of u/nullc's email:


a timeout so that a bit is not forever burned if a proposal is ever
abandoned (e.g. because something better came along before it
activated).  This isn't a timeout for the proposal, but for the bit
assignment.  If a proposal hasn't activated but there is still
interest it will just get a new bit (and can alternate back and forth
between a pair). This is a timeout of the bit, not the proposal.


communicate abandonment to old software, so a timeout must be set in
This means that segwit can and almost certainly will still be up for signalling after the November 15th timeout of the current bit used in the version.

I asked greg on IRC about it:
    &lt;achow101&gt; gmaxwell: how did you reverse engineer chips to find out if they used asicboost? did you look at firmware or do the whole x-ray chip thing?
    &lt;achow101&gt; (or both)
    &lt;gmaxwell&gt; achow101: it's confirmable alone, but I also worked with someone who has had their chip under a SEM (though obviously I didn't do that myself).
    &lt;gmaxwell&gt; er it's confirmable from firmware alone.

AFAIK, there was never any such proposal from the authors of segwit to have it activate at 51%. That threshold is simply too low to safely activate a consensus rule change. No fork has ever activated with only 51% signalling.
95% is achievable because it has been done in the past with 4 previous soft forks. BIPs 34, 66, and 65 all used the same IsSuperMajority activation mechnaism which activated the rules at 75% and made all blocks less than the version number specified (2 for BIP 34, 3 for BIP 66, and 4 for BIP 65) invalid after 95%. All of them reached the activation thresholds The CSV soft fork used the same BIP 9 Versionbits activation mechanism as segwit; it required 95% of blocks in a retarget period to signal for it. This soft fork also activated without much issue. So clearly 95% is a feasible activation threshold and has been achieved multiple times in the past.

@_date: 2016-09-23 20:55:41


True, but the low fee for signatures encourages the consumption of more UTXOs. This will inherently lead to larger transactions, and thus it is possible (likely) that the fees from these transactions will be greater than what we are assuming here, thus providing more income in fees for the miners.


No it does not. But segwit changes how the transaction is serialized for signature validation so that the cost for validating a transaction is less than with a normal transaction.


How does segwit increase the likelihood of orphaning a stale block over a larger conventional block? Nothing about it makes it invalid. Signature validation time is decreased, so it will be faster to process.
@_date: 2016-09-06 00:22:32

Your layman's terms suck and indicate that you don't understand how segwit works, especially when it comes to backwards compatibility with old nodes. Also, block propagation isn't linear node-to-node as you are suggesting here.


But now they are earning $1000 (8 * $125 = $1000) instead of $800. They are earning more money by using segwit instead of not. It does not cost them significantly much more, and certainly not any more than a block size increase.


A segwit block cannot be considered non-standard; there's no such thing as block standardness. There is only valid and invalid. A segwit block is considered valid to old nodes; that's how soft forks work. The signature data will simply be left off when the block is sent to a non-segwit node. Please stop spreading FUD.
As for the additional bandwidth and signature validation overhead, it's no different from a blocksize increase. In fact, the overhead will be less when it comes to signature validation.

Here's how it would work.
A user would add the tr()'s and submit a PR to me. I would merge that into my branch. Then I would generate the english .ts (Qt uses .ts) file. I would upload that file to transifex to be translated and pull down what's already been translated. Then submit the combined changes (tr()'s and the updated .ts) to goatpig.
If there is no corresponding .ts or translation for a string in a tr(), it will automatically default to the English string that had to be passed in. This is what is already happening. Many strings in Armory are in tr() and many are not. However, the software still works even without any translation files whatsoever.

No. A soft fork means that a new feature is introduced which does not break the current consensus rules. Old software won't be able to recognize the new rules but everything that happens under those new rules are still valid under the old rules, so old nodes don't need to upgrade in order to still function and follow the main chain. In order to use the new rules, you need to upgrade to new software, but there is no need for you to use the new rules if you don't want to.

How so?
1/4 the signature part does not mean 1/4 the entire fee. So, if they are able to fit 2 transactions in the block vs. 1, the second transaction will likely have a fee greater than the fee that would have come with the signatures of just one transaction. Thus there would be a net profit so miners will want to include segwit transactions.

A transaction that has been broadcast cannot be "fake". In order for a transaction to be seen by all nodes on the network (and for it to show in the receivers wallet), it must be valid and thus not fake. However it is certainly possible to make an image which looks like a transaction was made and broadcast, but the receiver would be dumb to not check that he actually received the transaction in his wallet.

Bitcoin Core 0.15 won't blacklist them. btc1 nodes won't be banned or added to a blacklist. They are only disconnected. There is a difference; disconnection means that you can repeatedly connect to a node and that node will accept your connection and P2P messages can be sent. A btc1 node will then be disconnected (i.e. the connection closed) after a 0.15 node receives its service bits and sees that it has either bit 6 or 8 set. Banning means that once the first connection is dropped, the node will refuse to accept any connection from the banned node until after a certain time period has passed (usually 24 hours).

It's not a demand or an ultimatum. It is a statement of fact. Many Bitcoin Core developers believe that if Segwit2x were to become Bitcoin, then it would mean that Bitcoin has failed. It would meant that companies have the power to impose consensus rule changes onto users and thus they can control Bitcoin. It represents a Bitcoin for which we are not interested in; such a Bitcoin would not be decentralized and we would not want to work on such a project, so we would just leave. This is not some childish demand.


We already got one; it's called Segwit.


We did; we put segwit (a block size increase) on the roadmap. The roadmap won't be updated because having a roadmap was a mistake in the first place.


There is no willingness to compromise because we do not want to do a compromise which would result in the network becoming compromised. Why should we compromise to something which we believe is going to make the state of the network (in terms of decentralization) worse than it currently is? Compromises are only good for political situations; this one, although it is now political, is primarily technical. You can't compromise on technical solutions because that will result in technical debt and be detrimental to the network as a whole.
Furthermore, I don't think that Segwit2x should even be considered a compromise. A compromise implies that both parties participated in a discussion about what to do and both parties negotiated and came to an agreement. This is not what happened with Segwit2x; the Bitcoin Core developers were not invited to any discussion about what should be done. There was no negotiation or discussion with the Bitcoin Core developers, there was just a few companies and miners that went to a meeting and came up with some extremely vague plan which they called Segwit2x. No Bitcoin Core developers were part of that meeting, and those that were invited were invited to essentially stamp their approval on it, not discuss what should be done. Because those that were invited were to only go and say "I approve of this", none actually went. This is not a compromise.

You could make a P2SH address which is a 2-of-2 multisig with an OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY with a block height of the fork's activation height. Then both of you send the coins that you wish to swap to that address. Then you create two transactions, one sends the coins to you on the Bitcoin chain, and the other sends the coins to on the segwit2x chain. For the transaction sending the coins to on the segwit2x chain, you can make it so that it is greater than 999920 bytes in size (which makes it invalid on the Bitcoin chain). For the transaction on the Bitcoin chain, you can have it include the segwit2x opt-in replay protection output if they have one. Otherwise have that one be locktimed to be several hundred after segwit2x's activation.
I think I will be making a post to describe this in more detail.

So you are extorting them. You are saying that you aren't going to do responsible disclosure and tell them the vulnerabilities you found. Instead you are going to laugh at them and try to get them to essentially pay you before you reveal the vulnerabilities, if you ever do. This sounds a lot like extortion and your statements make you seem incredibly scammy and untrustworthy.

Can you give any examples? Often times PRs that have one or two NACKs but several ACKs will be merged although it depends on the PR. If only one person opposes it (e.g. luke-jr is the only person that opposes the removal of priority) but everyone else ACKs the change, then it will likely be merged anyways.

Right. The backing out transaction can be replaced with the refund transaction that spends from the addresses you described above. So if either party backs out of the transaction before depositing, then the spending transactions won't exist and whoever deposited can get a refund. This then makes it so that once both parties have deposited funds and the spending transactions created and signed, there is no way for them to back out of the transaction as suggests above.

This is a basically trustless way to do an atomic swap for Segwit2x and really any chain split in the future. It allows two parties to do a swap and allows any of them to back out of the swap if they decide they don't want to do it.

A dust output is defined as an output where you will end up paying more than 1/3 of the outputs value in transaction fees.

No, I believe that means that there are edge cases where a non-upgraded node can actually validate a segwit transaction.
Edit: actually there are edge cases where a transaction would fail to segwit nodes but not to non-upgraded nodes. This would happen in the case of a segwit script being the wrong length. Non-upgraded nodes would still not spend from transactions containing those invalid scripts because it considers the entire transaction non-standard and will wait for a confirmation before accepting it.

There is no such thing as "system maintenance" of the blockchain. The blockchain is not a service, it is just a data structure shared by every single peer on the Bitcoin network. Getting a confirmation for a transaction is completely dependent on the transaction fee. Your wallet should support dynamic fees (if it doesn't, use a new wallet) which means that it will calculate an appropriate fee for your transaction. You may need to change some settings in order for it to calculate a fee that will let your transaction confirm even faster than the default.


No. Once a Bitcoin transaction has been broadcast, it is irreversible. You can try a double spend which would send the Bitcoin back to yourself, but in order for that to be successful, you need the double spend transaction to be confirmed instead of the original.
@_date: 2016-10-20 04:49:16
Again, do not pay a fixed transaction fee. The transaction fee is dependent upon the size of the transaction in bytes (think of a transaction as a file that is sent to everyone on the network. that file has a size and that is what you are paying for). On  it will tell you what the fee should be for the median transaction size. However your transaction may not necessarily be that size. It all depends on how many inputs you are spending and how many outputs you are creating. Your wallet should be doing all of this for you though, you should not need to worry about manually setting a fee. What wallet do you use?
@_date: 2016-10-20 02:29:23
There are no issues with the blockchain. There are no "delays" with the blockchain. There is no central service called the blockchain. What the hell are you talking about?
You get confirmations by sending transactions with a transaction fee. Your wallet should be using dynamic fees (if it is not, you should enable it) which means that it will calculate the optimal fee to have your transaction confirm in whatever timeframe you have the dynamic fee set to.

We shouldn't tell new users to use web wallets at all. IMO the best thing would be to advise them to use the desktop or mobile wallets listed on bitcoin.org.

I think the idea is that they think that getting 16% support will convince the majority of the rest of the miners to also support BU. I'm pretty sure there's a logical fallacy somewhere in there and he is just too optimistic about that. The 80% probably has to do with some activation threshold in order for BU to increase their block size limit.

Your statement implied that you wanted the developers to reset the difficulty. The difficulty and the target are inherently linked together. Actually, difficulty doesn't exist, only the target. The target doesn't adjust with respect to difficulty since difficulty isn't really a thing. The target adjusts in relation to the time it took to find 2016 blocks, not the difficulty.


Resetting the difficulty so that everyone can CPU mine means that people's computers are capable of generating blocks within a reasonable amount of time. This means that 1 confirmation is no longer secure because a malicious attacker could easily generate enough blocks to fork the blockchain and attack you. There are multiple attacks published which rely on an attacker having the resources to mine a few blocks, and by resetting the difficulty, attackers will have the resources to mine a few blocks. That makes having a lower difficulty less secure.

No it wouldn't. Segwit as it is now uses p2sh addresses (3... addresses) which have been around for a very long time and most people are familiar with them. Anyways, the wallet software handles all of this in the background. Even with bech32 (proposed native segwit address format), users are still just entering a string which they recognize as an address and the wallet handles everything in the background.


IIRC the best case is actually 2.2 MB blocks, which is more than double the current capacity. In the average case, the block size will be ~1.9 MB which is just about double the current size.


Your comment indicates that you don't understand how segwit works and completely misses the additional benefits of segwit. Segwit does not make a second block, it changes the transaction format for segwit nodes only and that transaction format is used in blocks. No "split block" is created. You also completely miss the quadratic sighashing issue which segwit fixes and the transaction malleability fixes.


Nor is a block size limit increase an answer to the scaling problem. It is just a delay tactic too. True scaling won't come from on-chain scaling, it will have to be off chain solutions like LN.

It's like change for a bill. The remainder is sent to another Bitcoin address that your wallet automatically generates.
@_date: 2017-05-14 03:49:10
The thing is, if you have a transaction that stays unconfirmed for multiple days, it is going to get evicted way before the expiry time anyways as the minimum mempool fee increases. For something to remain unconfirmed for several days means that the transaction paid a very low fee rate, and as more transactions are paying fee rates higher than it, it will get pushed out.

With both Bitcoin Core and Armory the transactions will appear as they normally do. The "from" addresses will be the P2SH addresses, and the "to" is your normal P2PKH or P2SH address. Other wallets will do the same as they should all be able to handle an arbitrary script in the scriptsig.
IIRC you won't see the transaction until there is one confirmation because non-upgraded nodes will reject those transactions as non-standard.
@_date: 2016-10-10 03:46:20
Resetting the difficulty means that there is some central controller that is capable of resetting the difficulty; completely anti-thetical to Bitcoin.
Furthermore, the current state of ASICs means that resetting the difficulty will do absolutely nothing, the difficulty will simply go back to where it already was. The only way to change the difficulty is to change the mining algorithm. Even then the mining algo will eventually fall prey to ASICs and the difficulty will go right back to where it was to being with.
Lastly, reducing the difficulty means that the security of the network will be decreased. If everyone can solo mine blocks within a reasonable amount of time, then many malicious attacks could happen and 1 confirmation would no longer make transaction reversal essentially impossible.

While theoretically possible, it is not as if all users are going to be in the dark about what is going on. If a majority of miners fork the blockchain, a lot of people are going to notice. Furthermore, if those miners are malicious and steal the segwit outputs, then a lot of people are going to notice that funds have been mass moved out of segwit addresses, although that may be harder to spot. They could in theory steal all the Bitcoin from segwit outputs if they were really careful and did it over a long period of time. But they can't hide the fact that a huge chain fork happened and a lot of people would be very suspicious that a lot of miners who were signalling segwit were on the fork and making non-segwit blocks.

There was a period of several months a while back where ATI (the original company behind Armory) stopped supporting and developing Armory. Once some legal stuff was sorted out, one of ATI's former employees, goatpig, continued development on it. The pace of updates is a bit slow and the quality is not as good as we would like since there really is only one person working on it full time (goatpig). The other developers (me and droark) work on it when we can and some other (random) people occasionally contribute.

There aren't actual "votes". It is done by the number of blocks in the last retarget period (2016 blocks) that have a version number set that signals support for the fork.

If you get a [sample]( of the malware and have it on a linux machine (preferably also a vm) and you run the command `strings` on it, you will see that there are three strings in the binary that are these three bitcoin addresses.

You should not be talking about the value of anything in a Bitcoin transaction (outputs, inputs, transaction fee) in terms of fiat. The fiat price of Bitcoin constantly changes, but the actual Bitcoin required to spend does not always. It is not that fees are getting insanely high making you have to pay so much in fiat for the fee, but rather that the price of Bitcoin is getting so high that the same amount of Bitcoin you paid for the fee a few weeks ago is now worth a lot more in fiat, but the fee itself is probably about the same. The fee rate has looked to be pretty stable, around 200 - 250 sat/byte, for the past several months.
@_date: 2017-05-14 05:32:37
The point isn't that we have the addresses but rather that we know the addresses are baked into the malware itself and not retrieved from some sever. Reading it off the screen just tells us that that is one of the addresses. Reverse engineering tells us that the address is a fixed value for a particular strain of the virus. That means that we can more accurately determine how many people are actually paying the ransom.

No, you most definitely do not understand how deploying such a change even works. A hard fork to increase the block size is not just "one line of code". Sure you can do that, but it most certainly will not be deployed in a safe manner. There is much more to it than just that. You need to have deployment code to manage the deployment and activate the change when there is enough signalling. Then there needs to be tests to make sure that the deployment works and that everything works afterwards. It most certainly is not just "one line of code" and anyone who claims that has no idea what they are talking about.


The definition of consensus is that everyone, users, devs, miners, must agree to the change. If not everyone agrees with the change, then it does not have consensus. Many devs and users and some miners do not agree with segwit+2mb, therefore it does not have consensus.

No, the largest 4 MB blocks are not equivalent to 2.2 MB traditional blocks. That is not how it works. IIRC it's almost a linear relationship, a 4 MB blocks is roughly equivalent to a 4 MB traditional block. The only way a segwit block would be 4 MB is if nearly all transactions in it were P2WSH transactions. The 2.2 MB number is from if the current ratio of P2PKH and P2SH transactions were all segwit.


Because increasing the block size would not have all of the fixes that segwit brings. It would be vulnerable to a large transaction DoS attack which uses the quadratic sighashing issue that segwit fixes. We would still have issues with transaction malleability delaying future upgrades like LN. We would still have issues with not being able to deploy new opcodes and transaction output script versions such as ones that support Schnorr signatures which can save a lot of space in a transaction by aggregating signatures. All of these can happen with segwit, but not with just increasing the block size limit. 


Segwit is not for propagating blocks and no part of it is to make blocks propagate faster. That is what Compact Blocks is for.

As long as they still use the same block data format that Core uses and provides the same RPC calls, then it will work fine. AFAIK Armory currently is compatible with XT, Classic, and BU. It should still be compatible with them if they hard fork to a larger block size, but if they do anything else like FlexTrans, then it won't be compatible.


You would not be able to spend from any segwit outputs since the bitcoind would strip away the segwit witnesses thus making the transaction invalid to all segwit nodes on the network.

The warning also only appears when you are not in initial sync, so users syncing new nodes will not receive the warning and the warning will go away after less than 50 of the last 100 block has the unexpected version number.
@_date: 2017-07-18 06:03:11
The message is a default message that is triggered when more than 50 of the last 100 blocks are a version number that Bitcoin Core does not expect to see. It is triggered on *anything* that changes the version number, not just BIP 91. It is designed to be independent of any proposal and is a warning that has been in Core for several versions already.
There won't be a statement about "don't panic, it's just BIP 91" because a) the developers don't support BIP 91 and b) BIP 91 could very well be a reason to panic as it has the potential to cause chain forks.

This is a website that I put together over the weekend in preparation of potential BIP 91 activation and BIP 148 activation. If the site detects a chain fork, there will be a big red alert at the top saying as such. Each node will also include the block hash and height at which the chain that it is following diverged from another node's chain. In the event of multiple chain forks, the most recent one will be shown for each node.
The website will consider any chain split of 2 or more blocks deep as a chain split. This is to avoid cases of orphaned blocks and of latency between the nodes.
The website will update its data from the nodes every 10 seconds. However you will need to refresh the page to see if there has been any changes.

There is no conflict of interest. Firstly, Liquid is for businesses, not users like you and me. Secondly, the blockchain cannot provide instant transactions, you still have to wait for confirmations which takes tens of minutes. Liquid allows for basically instantaneous transactions.

An attacker with access to a node's RPC interface can issue the `invalidateblock` command which will mark a block invalid (and thus any block built on top of it will also be marked invalid). This can be used to ensure that your node will not switch back to using the main chain. Then they can use `bannode` to disconnect you from and ban connections from any real node. Lastly they use `addnode` to have your node connect to nodes the attacker controls and those nodes can feed you the alternative blockchain.

The count on xbt.eu is off by one. It looks like they start counting one block after the period starts. My site (btcformonitor.info) should be accurate as I am getting the count statistics from the node and that counts it exactly as it does for determining activation.
I will add (tonight or tomorrow morning) percentage that shows when there have been more than 50 blocks in mined in the period. The reason for this is that at low block counts a percentage is extremely dishonest (still dishonest with 50 though) because of variance. Percentage should really only be trusted when there are hundreds of blocks as that will be less affected by variance.
The percentage thing has been added.

The unconfirmed one will disappear, as I said above. In fact, it will disappear pretty much the instant that the confirmed transaction is included into a block. This is because all nodes (except some for block explorers such as blockchain.info) will see the other transaction is in a block and thus remove the unconfirmed one from their mempools since it can never become confirmed.

PSBT is used when you need to pass around a transaction to different people and/or computers in order for it to be signed.
There are four main use cases that I was considering when writing the BIP: multisig, CoinJoins, airgapped wallets, and hardware wallets.
The easiest ones to explain are the airgapped wallet and hardware wallet use cases; they're pretty much the same. Basically, an airgapped wallet has the private keys on an offline machine, and hardware wallets have the private keys on a specialized hardware device. Neither of those have access to the blockchain but in order for signing to occur, you need to have some additional information from the blockchain. PSBT contains all of that information so that the offline signers and hardware wallets can sign the transaction.
For multisig and CoinJoins, the point of PSBT is that it will be a standard data format that can be passed around. So if you have multiple people using multiple different software but they all implement PSBT, then you can pass around a PSBT without worrying about whether someone else's wallet can understand the transaction.
@_date: 2016-07-31 01:51:58
The wallet has to trust a server run by someone else to provide the proper and validated data. There is also a privacy risk as that server will know about the transactions that you send and may know about the transactions that you receive.

It all really depends on what the hard fork is changing.
For example, in the ETH hard fork, someone did lose his coins, the DAO attacker.
But in another hard fork, such as a block size increase, you probably would not lose your coins.
And in yet another hard fork "proposed" by r/btc'ers, segwit as a hard fork would cause anyone who is holding Bitcoin in a timelocked transaction to lose their Bitcoin.

Is Bitcoin Core fully synced (on both ends, although receiving is most important)? Open up Bitcoin core and see if it says anything about being out of sync or having some time left to sync (e.g. 1 Year and 6 months left). This usually appears in a green progress bar in the bottom. If Bitcoin Core is not synced, then he will not be able to see any Bitcoin that he received until it is.
If Bitcoin Core is synced, check that Armory is as well. Start Armory and when it is fully loaded, look at the bottom right hand corner. Does the number of blocks there match the number of blocks that Bitcoin Core reports (hover your mouse over the check mark icon in the bottom right hand corner of Bitcoin Core).

No. That is completely incorrect. This is an automatic warning triggered by the software when the software does not know about the version number.

w.r.t Bitcoin Core and Electrum, the problem that PSBT is solving is inter-client compatibility. In particular, this makes multisigs and CoinJoins easier as it allows people to use the same data format for transactions so there isn't any concern with any of the participants having problems with whether someone else's wallet software can understand the unsigned transaction.
The example is that two people are in a multisig (or a CoinJoin, it doesn't matter), with one person using Bitcoin Core and the other using Electrum. If both have PSBT implemented (IIRC Electrum doesn't yet), then either person can create a PSBT, give it to the other person, and both would be able to add their signatures to it without any additional hassle.
Prior to PSBT, both Bitcoin Core and Electrum have their own transaction formats for transactions that are not yet fully signed and neither of those formats was well specified nor contained all of the information needed to produce the final transaction.

True, but it is pretty rare that when you pay someone you are able to exactly spend the amount of one input. In most cases, there will be a change output. With only one input and one output, it is more likely that it is the same person at each address.
It would be more effective to send the Bitcoin to multiple different addresses in a transaction with multiple outputs than to send it all to one address in one output.


You could use a CoinJoin transaction through [JoinMarket]( which will mix your coins. Using multiple CoinJoins can thoroughly tumble your Bitcoin without ever trusting a third party to hold your Bitcoin.

Sure you could do that, but it is a whole other matter if you don't want people to know that multiple outputs belong to the same person. For example, say I had two reddit accounts that I did not want people to know were the same person. If each account was associated with an address and had received Bitcoin at that address, then I would have to be careful to not create a transaction that spends from those two addresses. Otherwise people could assume with a fair amount of certainty that those two addresses belong to the same person and thus the two accounts belong to the same person. This is how people on bitcointalk find people's alts.

It does not fix enough problems and opens up a new attack possibility. 
Increasing the block size limit means that a transaction could theoretically be created of the same size as the block size limit. This transaction could be crafted to contain several thousand signature operations (sigops). The issue is that sigops-to-verifying-time scales quadratically, meaning that doubling the number of sigops in a transaction causes the time to verify that transaction to quadruple. This is a huge issue with a higher block size limit.
Furthermore, such a change does not do anything else to help with scaling, it merely kicks the can down the road. The alternative solution, segwit, allows for further scaling by allowing additional versioning which allows for new algorithms that help scaling to be easily included in the future. Segwit also fixes that sigops issue by making it scale linearly.

We can kind of know how many addresses there are. The maximum number of addresses possible is 2*2^160. This is due to the 160 bit RIPEMD160 hash that is encoded as a Bitcoin address.

`invalidateblock` is used in the event that there is a large work fork which the node operator does not believe to be the real blockchain.
For example, suppose a soft fork has deployed and some miners who did not upgrade to the soft fork rules produce blocks that are invalid under those new rules. They are also lucky enough that this fork of the blockchain has more blocks than the one built by miners enforcing the soft fork rules. A node that has not upgraded to the soft fork rules would follow the blockchain containing the invalid blocks.
However the community of a whole has agreed that the soft fork has activated and that the true main chain is the one with the soft fork rules activated. Since that chain is the one everyone is actually using, a node operator of an non-upgraded node would use `invalidateblock` in order to mark the non-soft fork chain as invalid so that he can switch to using the chain that everyone else considers to be valid.
If you think that this can't happen, you'd be wrong. Such a fork occurred in [July 2015](

Once you are fully synced, it won't be running at full power. It has to run at full power in order to sync as fast as possible.
Pruning still does that. It still needs to download the entire blockchain and process it. But it deletes old blocks after there are a few hundred blocks on top (IIRC it's 288 so that there are two days of blocks just in case). This results in it only consuming a few Gb, ~3 Gb IIRC.

Yes that is true.


Those two things you just said are not related to each other, and don't quite make sense.
The hash that hides your public key is the RIPEMD160 of the SHA256 of the public key. This goes into the output script. When you spend Bitcoin, your wallet should be creating transactions that use as little inputs as possible. Ideally you should not be reusing addresses, so each address should only ever be involved in one input and in one output, so when you use a UTXO, then the change goes to a newly generated change address and the address that UTXO belonged to should never be used again.
The public key is revealed whenever you sign something, so this includes transactions and signed messages. Once the public key is revealed, the security risk is that if someone were able to break ECDSA, then they could recover the private key from your revealed public key. By not reusing addresses, when your public key is revealed, the Bitcoin that could be spent by the private key is already gone so even with ECDSA broken, your Bitcoin would still be safe.


Yes, you reveal your public key.

As of now, no, there are no such services that do that. If there were, there is a huge risk that the service would be taking on. Suppose a customer buys something use a CC. The money is instantly converted to BTC and you are able to withdraw the Bitcoin. Suppose that customer now decides to chargeback the transaction. You didn't lose any money, but the service does since they gave you Bitcoin but did not receive any fiat from the customer. Alternatively, they could force you to wait 180 days to get out of the chargeback time frame but no merchant would want to wait half a year before they could get their money.
