My father was marveling at my bitcoin yesterday. He said “that’s more money then I ever made in a year, let me ask you when is your exit point?” Never. “Never? What if it goes to zero overnight?” First of all it won’t, second of all I have to be honest with you dad, if it did go to zero I am prepared to go down with the ship. That’s how much I believe in bitcoin. “Wow, ok”

Bitcoin is the fairest form of money the planet has ever seen. Try again.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:08:21
I agree. I’m in a similar position as OP, although OP has double the coins I have, but I make about 250k usd per year currently. So my risk management strategy is to throw it all into traditional investments like the stock market and keep enough cash on hand to weather downturns. That way I can hodl forever. I agree with OP though that you need a risk mitigation strategy. Although anybody who bought in at the right time in 2011, 2012, 2015, or 2016. Has already had their initial investment paid back to them via the forks. My initial investment was $13,500 and both forks made me $60,000 combined. So it’s all house money at this point. HODL 4 lyfe. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:50:27
Well if you think it’s going to die like MySpace then that’s fatal. High transaction fees have already been addressed via segwit and will continue to be addressed down to nothing over lighting network when it goes live. The other word for community infighting is called democracy. The forks are just like altcoins that use bitcoin as their premine, plus they represent a nice dividend for bitcoin holders. I made 60k off forks this year, which I reinvested into bitcoin which is another reason to hodl bitcoin. Consolidation of power by whom? Core. That’s a joke. Core is a loose gathering of smart people who get together on their own volition to work on bitcoins code. So far away from its original vision it’s scary? I think if you look at the technical underpinnings of bitcoin. You’ll see that we are right on track with satoshis vision. The people who get confused by this are the people who only read the white papers title “a peer to peer electronic cash system”. We’re not a peer to peer electronic cash system yet, that’s true. However we will be, it’s just going to happen on second layer.

You can tweak bitcoin itself, so why do you need the centralized pre mine coin? Oh I know, because you think it gives you a better shot at being rich. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:28:38

@_date: 2017-12-11 12:22:50
Just like fiat turns out there are winners and losers in capitalism who knew! But now we have a system that makes the poorest bitcoiners richer through deflation. Even if someone is a trillionaire, why does it matter to me if I have enough money to provide for my own needs and wants. I’m a millionaire now and I can tell you after a certain amount of shit, there’s not that much shit you even really want to buy.

Then I remind myself that person 3 years ago was me and I made a calculated decision and then stayed steadfast through all manner of bullshit. It’s been a bumpy ride as a hodler and it will continue to be bumpy. People who think it’s easy have never done it lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:42:02

I bought them at the bottom when they were $220 a piece about 3 years ago. Spent around $8600 at the time. $5,000 of which was gambling winnings from a rather great night out at the blackjack table. My coins are very secure and very decentralized so there is no single point of failure. Honestly it can be nerve wracking at times, but that’s kind of the fun part lol the weird thought I keep having is to dump all my coins before they reach their potential, not because of anything wrong with bitcoin. Bitcoin is stronger then ever in my opinion, but because I feel deep down I don’t deserve to be rich. It’s a thought I fight against and struggle with constantly. Like if we see a million a coin do I really deserve 40 million at such a young age? Lol that’s a crazy amount of money. I play these kinds of mental games with myself all the time, which is really a waste of time because I’m just gonna keep hodling, but it does keep me entertained. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:35:26
I know this is the bitcoin forum, but I had 15,000 eth at one point and dropped them for $75,000 or something. You do the math on what they’re worth today. It stings lol

Don't have a trust fund. DID get a partial gift of home equity from my father when I got married this year, DID live with parents while we were engaged to save money (we don't have basements here). Don't think I'm bragging because this really isn't a lot of money. You need to change your idea of what rich is. I come from that class of people who had a little wealth (couple million), made sure their kids college was paid and that they learned about money and started early and often. We weren't rich, but we certainly weren't living paycheck to paycheck like other people. I plan to continue that tradition with my family. Also anyone can do what I'm doing if they're committed. It's not hard if you get your income up.

@_date: 2017-02-04 17:34:53
It's considered well off here too. I'm definitely in the top earner bracket for my age group in the US. It only takes an annual income of $106,000 to be in the millennial 1% here in America. So with our combined income I guess we're in the 0.45%. Which would make me worth more then most people my age, but as the baby boomers start to die there is going to be a huge wealth transfer between generations. So even if some of my peers don't have similar net worths now, they may in a few years. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 18:55:59
People always think those that have twice as much as they do are rich. When really it's the people that have 20,000 times more that are.

Roth IRA. A retirement account where you pay taxes on the income then pay no taxes when you pull out later. It works the opposite way a traditional IRA works or a 401k but contributions are capped at $5,500 per year
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:09:12
When you're young and new in your career it's easy to have 100% growth in a 401k because you just save the money. When you get older and the values get higher it becomes much much harder. This is my personal tracking of my net worth, it wouldn't make much since for me to lie to myself. I'm not trying to impress anyone with my paltry quarter million. That's pocket change to successful people.

GBTC and Tesla good buddy. So I mostly have Bitcoin to thank for that as well. Plus if I'm being honest I didn't make 2015's contribution til April, but I did make 2016's contribution in August. So it's $11,000 instead of $5,500 during that time period. Unfortunately because my income is going to be up this year, 2016 was my last year contributing unless lord emperor trump fixes that bullshit rule. Although it should be noted that a lot of high earners do what's known as a back door roth to get around that. So I'll probably do that. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 09:49:37
I think the idea that we go backwards in time to some kind of precious metal barter system is ludicrous. We either go forward into the future with Bitcoin and crypto or we slide so far back the only real currency will be whiskey and ammo, and I got whiskey and ammo lol although I'm banking on btc
@_date: 2017-02-04 08:50:46
It's a good idea. Tracking your personal growth rate is awesome. I recommend personal capital if you have a bunch of financial accounts you want to track against the S&amp;P. I'm trying to shoot for a super ambitious 100% growth every year. I know it's ridiculously high, but people said I couldn't do it last year and I proved them wrong! So we'll see...

Moon is when one Bitcoin buys you a mansion or a nice boat. Moon is when people flat out don't believe you that you own a full coin. Moon is when bitcoins market cap is higher then golds and thought of more highly. Moon is a when each coin is worth multiple millions of dollars. That's moon.

I'm not going to tell you to get a Trezor like everyone else, but you should move your funds into coinbases vault option if they aren't already there. It's coinbases version of cold storage and takes 48 hours to withdrawal. In case you're hacked. Also it's hilarious people are mad at you for humble bragging about 8 btc. Once upon a time that was a pittance around these parts lol only shows you the true power of hodling. 5 years from now noobz will be chastising dudes for humble bragging about 0.8 btc lol

Not sure how unexplained my Bitcoin wealth would be. I bought them through an exchange that complied with all US laws at the time. I hold them and haven't sold any so I'm not subject to capital gains. If they tried to take anything from me I'd have every right to drag them into a Years long legal battle, where I would ultimately prevail. Better yet let some rich bitcoiner do it and set the precedent.

I was at the pub with a mate of mine the other day and he was ribbing me about all my "imaginary" money aka Bitcoin. It's amazing to me. This is a guy who I've known forever. I told him repeatedly about Bitcoin when i was accumulating in the low 200's and he ignored me. My Bitcoin net worth is 50 times higher then his regular net worth. I guess jealousy and greed and fear all blend together in people and make it very hard to see things clearly. Oh well hodl on motherfuckers.

Listen, I'm in your same position. Here's the bottom line. I come from wealth, this may be new to you so here's some simple advice. Money will not make you happy, things will not make you happy, but money can provide security for you and your family. Money can allow you autonomy and control over your time. Money is a broad tool and it can be used in all sorts of ways, but the only sensible way is to live on less then you make and save the remainder for the future. As time increases the amounts you can live on and save will grow and you can give it all away on your death bed or pass it down to the next generation.

Basically I gave my friend a full coin back in the beginning of 2015. He was getting married and I knew he wasn't financially secure or financially savvy so I viewed this gift as a very nice thing to do for him. I explained the future implications of this money and how it could one day help him pay down his mortgage. He nodded in agreement, promised not to spend it and then 6 months later sold it around $330. The worst part is this dude makes 150k a year and we live in a low cost area. I know how much he makes because we run a business together and split profits. It's like did you really need the $330 that bad dude? Now neither of us have the coin. lol I would feel great if he had it and it kept going up in value, I'd feel like a great friend. Now I just feel like I wasted a coin that should still be mine. His dumbass probably would have been just as happy with a vitamix or some other bullshit from bed bath and beyond. Moral of the story bitcoins are not wedding presents.

500k is 45% likely to occur in my opinion. Remember while bitcoin goes up the dollar goes down. So that 500k will not have 500k purchasing power. A lot of really smart and powerful people believe bitcoin will go to 1 million and beyond. It’s not just macafee. Most are just too conservative to come out and say it. You have to remember that when you die the world will look very different then it does today and trillionaires will be the new billionaires. Billionaires will be common. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 19:11:23
There won't be 21 million coins in our lifetime, millions of coins are lost forever. Satoshis million coins haven't moved since inception etc... so do your math on a 16 or 17 million coin supply and then figure in hodlers who aren't selling

Dude when I started buying in at $220 i was really bummed I had missed out at $2.20. It’s a cycle that will repeat.

@_date: 2017-10-22 03:27:09
My definition of rich here in the western United States is above 10 million dollars net worth. So if it’s 10 bitcoins at a million then 10. If it’s 100 bitcoins at 100k then 100. Somewhere between 10 and 100 in the next 10 years. Longer term probably one will be enough to buy a nice house and have some good security for you and your family. My long term target 20 years is 2.8 million per coin.

Money needs to be both a means of exchange and a store of value. The fight we’ve all been having for years is which comes first. Welcome to the fucking show noob noob.

See I’m from a family with money and my father is dying of cancer. So at some point in the next five years I’m going to inherit 5 million or so. I plan to do with his money exactly what you said. Invest in index funds etc... and provide stability for future generations. Everyone’s situation is different, so I guess you have to do what is right for you. Luckily I can afford to take the risk. Not everyone can. You have to do what’s right for you.

It’s a lot less then you’d think. There was a study that said only 300,000 people have more the $5,000 worth of bitcoin. Right now it’s like 130k to join the club. How many People even have 130k laying around that isn’t in a retirement account or wrapped up in their house. 9% of Americans? Of those how many have the risk appetite to buy 130k worth of bitcoin? 0.001% of the 9%? So let’s say 32,000 Americans have the balls to go 21 and beyond. That is a very small minority. If you have 21 you’re in rare air.

I often find the only people bragging about their money are the people that don't have any. I know one almost billionaire and he obviously never talks about money, because he's above it. I know many single digit millionaires who feel they're broke and so would never brag about how little they feel they think they have and then I know a whole bunch of people who drive a leased Mercedes who will happily brag about how rich they are. It's usually a sign someone doesn't have much.

To be fair most if not all of us went from shitting on it to jumping on the bandwagon. Once you have that moment of realization you realize how stupid you were. Don’t judge the cubes too harshly, he put radio on the internet for goodness sake!

One of the things that first excited me about crypto was the possibility that each satoshi could in theory many years in the future achieve parity with the dollar. $100,000,000 per Bitcoin. Now I realize Bitcoin would have to become the most dominate economic force on the planet for this to happen and that it would most likely not be me, but my great grandchildren enjoying the money. However I still believe this is a possibility in 100 years or so. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:29:40
Bitcoin is the real money dude. No I don’t go back to USD.
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:26:03
I sold all my BCH for obvious reasons and bought bitcoin with it. Which I won’t be telling the government about because I don’t view it as a capital gain. More like a reinvested dividend,  but no man I don’t plan to sell ever. First of all I have nothing I want to buy... lol I have a decent middle class house. Two decent cars in the garage. An equivalent amount of money in traditional investments. I don’t need a lambo, in fact I think they’re stupid and pointless with autonomous cars on the horizon. I’m just content to be content. The security of the money is nice, it’s nice knowing that if I wanted to I could quit it all and live comfortably for 5 years or so without generating any new income. My goal is to get to a place where that security is longer then my projected lifetime AKA early retirement. So when I’m say 35 and I have 70 years of money laying around I can buy the ultimate thing back, my time. Plus everytime I think about selling to buy another asset I’m like where can I get 28x? Other then doing a startup there’s nowhere.

Shit I remember paying $9,200 to be in the 1/500,000 club back in 2015. Today it would cost $240,000 which is more then my house costs. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:20:53
Obviously no one has any real data, so I’m guessing too. However I remember reading the forums in 2013 and it was crazy the amount of people expressing remorse over thousands and thousands of lost coins.  Either from hard drives that got thrown away, people who lost the private keys, couldn’t remember passwords etc... 
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:18:12
Maybe not in our lifetime...
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:08:30
I used to have 63 coins so I’ve cashed out some and made some profits. I’ve gotten back my original investment and spent a little on funding more traditional investments etc... everything I have in now is pure profit. 42 bitcoins of house money. I will hodl them until 2030. Long term holding is the only way to play this game. You really have to shift your mindset to as far down the road as possible. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:05:31
I’m super confused now. I’m downloading core as we speak, but was planning to use it as a validator only. I do not want it to act as my main wallet. I’d be fine sending 1 bitcoin to it, but I would like to keep the majority of my coins on my Trezors and keepkeys. Can someone advise.
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:00:42
Future average bitcoiner. “All these idiots mocked me for buying 0.07 bitcoin at 25k but look who’s laughing now!!! Me!”

16 months ago I had my holy shit moment and got into Bitcoin the price was $210 then. I bugged friends and family and ranted and raved like a lunatic. Everyone treated me like a crazy moron, now I remain silent and patiently and quietly get rich. 
@_date: 2016-10-31 04:13:39
Quite the opposite. I'm saying each coin will be worth 100k

Personally I think $10 today will be worth $1,400 in 2022.

I sold 400 shares of GBTC at $120... kill me. It's making it hard to enjoy this price rise for me even though I've made like 75k in one month lol I keep thinking it could have been double 
@_date: 2016-10-30 15:37:03
Seems like you're trying to hold for the short term and make a quick buck. If that's the case then no. You're straight up gambling and could get burned.
@_date: 2017-05-25 05:57:36
Right? I'm feeling the same way.

I think vitalik is a very ethical guy too, but if someone was trying to compel me to change a few lines of code with the threat of spending the rest of my life in prison I'd relent in less then 10 seconds.

Man, I was at the bar with my friend who had the same thing happen to him. Had to sell his 3 coins to pay for his dads hospital stay. Life happens, at the end of the day it's just money. It won't buy you happiness, just some security and you can always make more of it. Chin up brother. I believe in you. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:56:03
Fuck everyone who advised me to wait for rootstock. You literally cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars with that shit advice. Once bitten, twice shy. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:26:18
It's so funny that 2 years in the game makes me a seasoned veteran in crypto. It's true though lol crypto developments happen at light speed. I feel like I've lived 20 years in the last two.
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:26:51
I agree with you. I'm still buying. Been buying since this day in 2015.
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:46:09
It's confusing then why you're attempting to educate me when I'm up more then you are. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 04:42:24
I call bullshit, but if it's true then congrats! I just doubt you would have missed 2013's headlines. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:19:09
Good luck playing the penny stocks fag lol actually I'm just teasing. I hope you do well man.

I'm finally starting to learn my lesson on this. Have been VERY obnoxious for two years now lol
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:41:34
It doesn't matter where the bottom is as long as you end up with more coins then you started with
@_date: 2017-06-12 12:24:12
I agree. I don't believe in any of the ethereum or golem I'm holding, I'm in it for a quick buck like everyone else.

I kept wishing we could hear naval and nick alone though I do appreciate Tim hosting. Just wanted a more advanced conversation with nick. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 14:32:44
I did buy at that time. I now have $120,000 worth, but I could have easily been you my friend. I was so close to not buying. Finally took the leap, then did my research afterwards. Glad I did, it took me reading the boards every night for a year before I was fully confident I would HODL forever.
@_date: 2017-06-02 15:13:21
What everyone said about true decentralization and network effects, but also... I'm up 10x on Bitcoin. From a humble investment of $8,000 I now hodl 100,000 usd worth. Why would I want to sell. It's the best investment of my lifetime. I have 40 coins and I'm still going to have 40 coins 15 years from now. After four more halvings I expect the price to be $250,000. 10 million in value for being patient? And just sitting on my ass? I'll take that all day. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 14:55:19
Think about it, he invents Bitcoin then he disappears to get a law degree so he can fight the government in order to keep his million bitcoins. Satoshi is a smart dude... er I mean Nick Szabo-NS-Satoshi Nakamoto

Dude! I gave my asshole friend a full Bitcoin 2 years ago for his wedding at $225 he sold it a month later for $300 dollars. I bring it up every time the price rises. Like oh hey man remember when I gave you $2,800 for a wedding present and you gave me $50 for mine lol all in good fun, but really he's a fucking moron.

I think you're right on factom 
@_date: 2017-06-12 12:42:22
A lot of people here are very intelligent with money. Crypto brings in hyper intelligent economic minds as well as the computer science guys. I've seen a lot of solid advice on this thread. For instance I'm 28 and worth $389,000 120k in Bitcoin.
