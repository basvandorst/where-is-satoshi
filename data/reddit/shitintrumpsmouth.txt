Requiring a change in consumer behavior for an entire payment model in a very short time for it to work as intended is surely the same as asking a select group of users to change their behavior over a period of years. 
Either that or you are an idiot.

This community needs to make up it's damn mind whether miners are 'evil terrorists trying to destroy bitcoin' or 'Great job guys'. Cause this shit passed pathetic about a year ago.

This sub has finally reached peak moron. Jesus how pathetic can you get.

When you have to MAKE people change how they use bitcoin for it to work, then the solution isn't good enough.

Obviously not. But as a generalization it's not incorrect.

Nothing more sad than a 'wealthy' 14 year old that doesn't understand crypto but isn't smart enough to realize it.

I literally can't help but think it is absolutely pathetic that Bitcoin corrects from 20x up in 12 months and everyone has to find someone to blame. WTF is wrong with you? Mempool is at 250k transactions and fees are $40.

Yes, obviously we should immediately attempt at getting them shut down based on a single person's accusation with zero evidence. 
Good job genius!
