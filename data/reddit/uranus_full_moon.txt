Bitcoin is eating his dinner and he is trying to starve it off. He's a smart guy and knows he's on the wrong side of history ... publicly. 
Bet in private, he's building a bitcoin fortune.

Gold mining ravages landscapes, pollutes rivers with sulfuric acid, and contributes to the destruction of areas like the Amazon. The environmental damage left by gold mining can last generations. 
Gold mining is difficult and dangerous work. Millions of gold miners earn low wages or are exploited by dishonest middlemen. Dangerous working conditions can cause illness, injury, or death. The risks are highest for the estimated 600,000 children who work as gold
 For too many communities, the costs of gold mining are far greater than the benefits. Gold mining has fueled a tragic civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, led to higher crime rates, facilitated the spread of disease, and threatened indigenous cultures - all while failing to lift local communities out of poverty.
Gold mining today relies on practices that are extremely harmful to the environment. Open pit mining devastates the landscape while cyanide heap leaching and mercury amalgamation contaminate the water, air, and soil. Modern industrial gold mining creates 20 tons of toxic waste for every gold ring.
Holding gold in unethical.

Make it a hobby and set a little time aside to learn something new about Bitcoin each week. Bitcoin is all about making you your own bank. It's about independence. Take everything I have just said above with a grain of salt. The more you understand Bitcoin, the more you will use it as a financial vehicle. From there, you will start seeing Bitcoin's even greater potential.

Bitcoin undermines the global economy as it currently operates. People, all 7.5 million of us could circumvent all governments, all payments of tax, and just economically interact with each other. 
This would fall the old system and so create the biggest wealth transfer ever known. Governments will try and stop Bitcoin, yet they will fail. 
Bitcoin will cause humanity to take quantum leaps in evolution, and not just economically.

It's like 1820's UK and being an early investor in the industrial revolution. This is a very unique opportunity.

I don't hold gold mainly because of the current 74 - 1 price difference between the two metals. Considering silver is required in manufacturing, and to have millions of drones, tonnes of solar panels, a space race to Mars, a multitude of electronics  etc etc, that takes a lot of silver. Flip side, silver passed peak silver in 2015. Large producers like Mexico and Peru are mining less. 
I'm betting of silver passing gold in Bitcoin value.
Also I think Bitcoin will obsolete gold as a store of value in a reasonably short time.

I suspect from your id, your country sells weapons to Saudi Arabia. Your country are a mate of the Saudi Government. The country who funds Wahhabism schools across the globe, were extreme hatred of western peoples are ingrained. From these schools, people are brainwashed into attacking western cities, and their citizens. As I am sure you are aware.
You ask what would I do if somebody steals from me and murders a beloved. That's already occurring and it's not one person, it's the members of your government and of my government. 
Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. I have changed my behaviour so to get a different result.
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:39:19
We can enact amongst ourselves. We can remain outside of the government's economy. We can starve governments of taxes. Without taxes, the government can't fund their weapons. Governments are impotent and so pointless.

This has been in the pipe line (excuse the pun) for a while now. Gold's been hoarded by Russia and China, lets hope the West is smart enough to dump valuing gold and use Bitcoin as a store of wealth. This would setback the Chinese and Russian plan.

Yes, Bitcoin. No alts, except a small handful of OMG. Made Bitcoin out of Vertcoin in the past and would consider flipping some of the coming forked coins into it.

I can see a time when critical mass will be reached amongst the peoples of this planet, and we will say enough. Radically change your ways governments, or we will destroy it all, and then build onto of your ashes. All that is required for this threat to hold power is for the people to mean it. 
If you were one of those governments, would you fall in line or be destroyed?

Governments are pointless. They are like banks that stand between people so to control the monetary system. There is no reason in time, what the government currently does can be done via smart contracts on bitcoin's blockchain.
Governments are for children. Not for mature adults.
