You meant basically Over-The-Counter shorting. It would be almost impossible to find someone willing to do so. People that buy cryptocurrencies buy it for the lack of bureaucracy and lack of oversight from the government.
If you bring to the table Accounting firms/Lawyers, must people would not be interested as with those come regulations, bureaucracy, taxes.
Due to the volatility of cryptocurrencies, that would also mean trusting that the escrow account in the Accounting firm would be solid, and would not go bankrupt/insolvent.
Too risky and complicated for it to be viable or interesting for the "HODL'er".

I didn't say you can't, I meant you shouldn't. It's better to be bullish into something that would rise in case BitCoin fails. Give the article I sent a go, you'll see what I mean.

I don't think I get what you mean. You want to short something, but not in the future markets? That's pretty much the only way to short something. Or do you mean you want to short something related to Cryptocurrencies in the future markets, but not necessarily the Cryptocurrencies themselves?

But you are talking from the side of the person that's short. I meant for someone who is long on Crypto, it makes no sense for them to go through all this effort, instead of just buying and holding.

You could buy very out of the money put options on Gold for a very low price. If crypto crashes, Gold will shot up and you'll be able to buy than cheaply, pocketing heaps of money. Because those scenarios are unlikely, those options are probably cheap now.
That's actually a good hedging strategy for people who have crypto, as a away to spread the risk. I would do it if there wasn't so much bureaucracy in standard trading.

There is no way to short it. Only thing I can think you could do, is buying Gold, as if cryptocurrencies completely fail, which is the scenario you believe in, people would buy more Gold as a store of value.
"Don’t try to short the bitcoin bubble, warns Nassim Nicholas Taleb. Mr Taleb warned that the development of a futures market may not stall bitcoin’s rise in price. “Futures that don’t have deliverables require a very, very deep market. Otherwise someone long in the future can push prices higher at settlement time with impunity,” he said."

Not telling you what to do buddy, it's your money. I'd advise against, but then again advise is cheap. Just giving some info, the more the better right?
“No, there is NO way to properly short the bitcoin “bubble”. Any strategy that doesn’t entail options is nonergodic (subjected to blow up). Just as one couldn’t rule out 5K, then 10K, one can’t rule out 100K.”
Taleb's view was reinforced by Cybersecurity pioneer John McAfee in a tweet earlier saying:
“Those of you in the old school who believe this is a bubble simply have not understood the new mathematics of the blockchain, or you did not care enough to try.
Bubbles are mathematically impossible in this new paradigm. So are corrections and all else."

Oh, you mean, renting your Crypto so someone can short it. The problem is, that would mean giving Private Keys to the person shorting it. Security breach.
