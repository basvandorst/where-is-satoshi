Move mouse around to generate  address

copy Public and Private to clipboard  
close out bitaddress       
re-connect internet         
send from coinbase to public address            
verify amount on blockchain        
select Import/export on blockchain       
select "add private key"       
Type in private key

I'm writing what they say, making sure to include when "virtual" is used and when "digital" is used. I believe this hearing makes it clear that some of these officials do not know of what they speak.
