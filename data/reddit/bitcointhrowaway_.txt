I'm occupied today, but I'll do a follow-up asap based on the tips and advice I've gotten here. If my case can help others that are at risk that would be some consolation for me.

I'm using GMail, my phone was lying in front of me on the desk, and I have not lost my phone recently. My computer was open and I was sat in front of it browsing on reddit.
@_date: 2014-01-26 21:05:38
My chronology in the OP was wrong. Both e-mails had arrived when I read the first, it just didn't show up on my cell phone yet for some reason.
@_date: 2014-01-27 14:45:58
I got the e-mail notifying me that a 2FA code had been requested before the transaction took place. Only by four minutes, but still.
@_date: 2014-01-26 21:02:13
No, I'm using e-mail for 2FA on blockchain, and SMS for 2FA for GMail.

The same happened to a friend of mine a short while back. Apparently no backup of the wallet had been downloaded.
@_date: 2014-01-26 22:22:40
I have not. I wanted to make sure it wasn't my fault, and I've now concluded that it is very likely that it is.
If I ever have that amount in the future I won't, either. I've learnt something today, at least.
@_date: 2014-01-26 22:20:59
Thanks. Wish I figured out this before I lost 2 BTC. 


There's a logging feature, but it was disabled by default, and I had not turned it on.


No encryption. Just clicked the backup to dropbox option from the wallet interface.


I'll take this into account and change how I secure everything in the future. Thanks.


Spot on.
@_date: 2014-01-26 22:24:18
Does that lend itself to usage of the coins?
@_date: 2014-01-26 21:39:52
Based on previous 2FA codes received, January 17th.
@_date: 2014-01-26 21:10:07
It was unique and 16 characters, uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols.
@_date: 2014-01-26 21:31:50
16 characters. No idea how I managed to write bits.
@_date: 2014-01-26 22:09:09
I'm almost certain that was it. For a brief time, it wasn't encrypted. I just stupidly clicked the download backup to dropbox option on blockchain.info.
@_date: 2014-01-26 21:18:42
Yes, there's no suspicious activity at all.
@_date: 2014-01-26 21:00:43
I have had my wallet backup stored on my PC in the past. You'll have to excuse my ignorance, but what is needed to brute-force a wallet backup? Finding the password?
@_date: 2014-01-27 14:57:02
I haven't downloaded the blockchain.info app, so that's not it.
@_date: 2014-01-26 21:20:06
I'm afraid I first downloaded it to dropbox a while ago before realising I shouldn't do that and moving it externally. In hindsight I should have moved the funds right then.

Will do.


Windows 7


I'm in living in a student village and am plugged directly into the wall. As there's limitations on how much traffic we're allowed daily I assume there's physical equipment in the main building.


There's no signs of remote control of the pc via TeamViewer etc.


 


Physical external drive. Not been connected to the pc since.


This one was set up in April. 
@_date: 2014-01-26 20:54:04
I'm using GMail, yes. There's no suspicious recent activity.
@_date: 2014-01-26 21:06:30
There's no filter there, as far as I can tell. POP and IMAP is enabled. Is there anywhere in the settings I can see if it has been in use?
@_date: 2014-01-26 21:30:21
My mistake. I meant 8 characters.
@_date: 2014-01-26 21:17:07
That does indeed sound like the most likely case. 
@_date: 2014-01-26 21:41:57
No suspicious activity there whatsoever. 
@_date: 2014-01-26 21:15:56
1. Somewhat. It's unique, but only 8 characters.
2. 16 characters, uppercase, lowercase, numbers and signs.
3. Both unique.
4. Yes, in the form of SMS. Have not received one. 
5. Running combofix at the moment.
