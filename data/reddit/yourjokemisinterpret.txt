Well he can't be right all the time. He has probably had some investments absolutely tank. I'm sure that's why he diversifies and doesn't put all his eggs in one basket. 
Besides, does he tell everyone each and every time he has a hot tip? I'm sure he is intentionally selective with what he publicly states. 
Are all his trades even publicly known (honest question)?

I always imagine half the people freaking out here about dropping, or those trying to pp others up to 'hold', each only have a fraction of the coin. 
Desperately trying to sell their narrative or influence the market all for their own $2k USD or less investment!

Oh well it's dropped another thousand in a day so I guess we wait and see. 
I'm sure Buffett has guys who are savvy in different fields explain ideas and concepts to him. Just because he can't mine Bitcoin doesn't mean he doesn't understand it. 
But no dramas either way, I'm not really arguing.

Yeah you would if you only bought 0.1 coins.

I'm definitely taking financial advice from a guy with HODL is his username and who sums up market movements with the "friends and families" thingamajig!

No you don't understand, this is all just because the Chinese are cashing out to buy their family presents and moon cake. They'll be back in for the pump soon!!

0.01 could be worth a billion US dollars in five years time.

The fact it doesn't do this kind of bullshit means it's a very stable and reliable currency.
