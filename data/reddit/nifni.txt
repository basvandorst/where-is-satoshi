Backup the wallet.dat, delete all of the bitcoin root folder but the folders containing the blockchain (so you do not have to redownload everything) and reinstall bitcoin. Then try again and replace the wallet.dat after that. Also you should have a Backup of your wallet.dat somewhere else anyway. You can try it with that one.

with pruned you dont download the full chain. Then you can send it to another wallet. just google for it.

If you just do it for sake of having it done in your life the easiest is choose a pool (I tried give-me-coins). Download cpuminer. Read doc of cpuminer and start mining. Will be pretty slow though. 
Better do litecoin to see some progress. But keep in mind you will never make money with this. 
CPU mining is really slow. You can then search for some gpuminer. I only tried cudaminer (for Nvidia) with litecoin. Usage is pretty similar to cpuminer and will be a lot faster. But still keep in mind. You do not make money with this!

Google for pruned bitcoin. There you won't need to download all of it but still using the same software (bitcoin-core) where you can import your wallet
Edit: I think you just have to start it with -prune=550
