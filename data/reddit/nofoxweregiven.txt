Fuck that I'd rather pay 60$ to send my BTC to another adress /s

What was the verification like for the 25? I guess you will have to provide some sort of verification as soon as you hit the magic KYC numbers they have in mind

To be fair I honestly dont know, he's a millionaire (not through bitcoin)  and was a early adopter so I'm imagining he has atleast a few hundred of them stored
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:13:55
Well, my uncle got some cool stuff figured out :)
He has 2 USB stick in 2 deposit boxes at 2 different banks in 2 different cities - keys are encrypted through TrueCrypt and he has the password to them written down on a paper he keeps in his house
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:23:16
Although you cant really compare houses or cars to Bitcoin you are right. If the price is low, buy - dont sell!
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:10:12
Xapo lets you convert BTC to USD and back, they charge a total of 3% for conversion to usd and back.

Im on the phone call with trump right now, about to discuss your question gimme 5 min and I'll hook you up
@_date: 2016-06-17 21:39:44
Did you guys ever think of him being an old man, working his last years on this to then publish it... get dementia/alzheimer  and just forget about it? As far as I am aware he never withdrew any of the Bitcoins he ever had... I dont see any other reason why he wouldnt withdraw his BTC over some services that mix his BTC. Would take a long time but its worth it.

Bought more at 957, it's now at 990.

How does mining become more profitable if the difficulty increases?
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:14:25
As far as nobody else is answering it should mean that people that bet their money on Bitcoin going down decided to cash out the money they bet on that.
@_date: 2017-01-12 19:22:19
ELI5 please

2, still not confirmed by the way, lol.
If anybody is interested I'll send the transaction # via PM
@_date: 2017-01-26 18:58:15




Arent the fees just a flat 2.5€?
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:41:28




Didnt know that, thanks!
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:09:00
Thanks man, soon I can buy 1 gold with 1 bitcoin /s
@_date: 2016-11-11 11:42:48
Can you buy with cash only or are you able to use credit cards or NFC tech too?
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:51:20
So they're giving out 4.2 Billion worth of Bitcoin? That's so cool! /s
@_date: 2016-11-10 19:28:28
Its called Ethereum.
@_date: 2016-11-10 11:46:43
Xapo.com - After verification you can withdraw 1000$ two times a day at any ATM with a fee of 2.5€ / 3$.
Could also convert your Bitcoin to USD instantly after you receive it so if the price if Bitcoin falls you will not be affected.
@_date: 2016-12-05 12:09:29
Why try cracking the CVV when you can just buy thousands of Credit Cards with CVV on the darknet
@_date: 2016-12-21 08:45:52
Anything specific you're basing that assumption on?
@_date: 2016-11-11 10:55:31
Because everybody pays 800€ a Bitcoin right now... How stupid can you be to do a single transaction this big with somebody you dont know with such a huge scam screaming overpay?
@_date: 2016-11-11 10:48:40
You fucking fraud. Stop copying other people's work.
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:35:23
You would need to be really unlucky for that, I dont think it will happen but transfers dont take that long usually so splitting up the transactions is a option if you dont need all the money really quick I guess
@_date: 2017-05-03 18:17:11
I wouldnt risk it, there can always be backdoors...
@_date: 2017-05-09 17:47:01
Germany, under 1 year? No.

2 words: Holy shit
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:32:09
I already said it a few times but I will again,
buying stocks at a ATH is stupid. Buying Bitcoin to hold shortterm, probably should cost average.
Holding long term? (2+ years?) buy it now.
@_date: 2017-05-06 15:49:54

Not trying to be mean or anything but you want information from him, he doesnt need to talk to you...
@_date: 2017-05-05 18:48:26
Did not say that, only wanted to correct the price :)
@_date: 2017-05-18 13:15:54
What is preventing you from you from doing the same thing with bank transfers in Europe? (Maybe even the US) After a few hours there is no way to chargeback too.
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:24:07
Maybe, maybe not - you most likely wont find this info on reddit though
@_date: 2017-05-05 11:10:16




Price per Bitcoin in February 2015: 250$

In the EU every transaction over 10,000€ must be reported to your local tax office, be it if you are travelling with it at a airport - sending or receiving it or buying a car for that amount. Basic anti money laundering measure. I dont think its very effective but lets leave that out of here. Also banks have a autoreport for transactions that big, so the german IRS gets this info and decides what to do with it. Because this person maybe had something to do with not paying their taxes before or who knows what, they decided to contact police and then police decided to "raid" the place. (They knock with a few guys and you can get some witnesses and your lawyer and then they go in, if youre suspected to hide stuff while theyre outside you wont have time for this though) I dont know how they convinced a judge to grant the permission for this...
@_date: 2017-05-13 11:36:46
As far as I am aware only about $20,000 was paid this far.
That's 0.003% of the daily trading volume.

Ja, die Meldung der Bank ersetzt natürlich nicht die eigene Meldepflicht

Übrigens müssen auf Bitcoins die über 1 Jahr in deinem Besitz sind keine Steuern abgegeben werden.
@_date: 2017-05-02 11:01:58
You shouldnt buy stocks at a ATH, I dont know how it is with Bitcoin though. I'd cost average it out.
@_date: 2017-05-17 13:46:06
Just tried and max I could buy is 10€ worth and I would've received 6.5€ worth of Bitcoin. Dont know what to say...

You can move your Coins off a wallet like trezor or other cold storages/offline wallet within minutes. If you have your coins on sites like coinbase you are basically trusting them not to go bankrupt or not steal your Bitcoins. Most people dont have that kind of trust and they shouldnt have

Youre a shill anyway but whatever Joseph,
check the whois of the website. See the site owner, google him and realize its a scam. Matter of 2 minutes. Now go shill somewhere else.

I guess this:
"On the other hand, the pending decision from U.S. SEC on Bitcoin ETFs adds a great deal of uncertainties to the market. On March 10th, the regulator denied the petition of the Bats BZX Exchange to list Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust as an ETF. The disapproval sent Bitcoin tumbling more than -6.0% on that day. However, on April 24th, a review on the disapproval decision was granted by SEC, opening the door for the petitioner to submit additional evidence till May 15th. Market participants then began to bet on a likelihood of a reversed decision on the Bitcoin ETF proposal."

If the creator cant crack it for $1,300,000 we for sure wont be able to either

The petitioner had to submit additional evidence till May 15th.

The price rising feels good and bad at the same time, I want to buy cheap coins but I also want my coins I have to rise in price
Bitcoin World Problems :/

I will be speaking in german because its easier to explain for me. Use google translate if you need to know what I am talking about.
Du musst jede Transaktion über 10,000€ beim Finanzamt anmelden. Sei es Bargeld oder Überweisung Banken melden automatisch jede Transaktion über diesem Betrag beim Finanzamt. Diese haben dann wohl Bitcoin gesehen und direkt die Blauen alarmiert. Das ganze ist in der ganzen EU so um Geldwäsche entgegenzuwirken.
Der PC kann übrigens sehr sehr lange einbehalten werden wenn die es wollen.

I just bought some Bitcoin and want to send $5 to my friend.
Standard fee got used and I just lost 40% of my money on this transaction...

Only thing that is for certain is that august first is gonna be a shitshow, if you think you can predict the price go for it - it can only go up or down. I personally wouldnt try to time the market

FUCK. I dont fucking know what to do?! Buy or sell? Price will go fuck knows where and August will be a even bigger shitshow... 
@_date: 2017-06-02 17:24:07
What kind of verification did you go through and how did you pay? Seems like you did it pretty easily! :) Thanks in advance
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:02:29
Will it go up? Yes
Bitcoin having a marketcap of $21,000,000,000,000? I dont think so
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:46:12
These are safe
