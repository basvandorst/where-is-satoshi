This deserves more upvotes. It might seem all simple and common sense to some people, but forgetting this is easy and is usually why people face troubles with their investments. Thank you for sharing this.

Forbes is just a blog. Purely based on opinion, and probably an agenda. And may I add, that it is a shitty blog (that's my opinion of it). You shouldn't be basing any trading decisions or analysis on Forbes, or any news websites for that matter. There is a big difference between news and actual research reports.
Edit: This is what an [actual bearish research report]( looks like, that was published in 2018 by a firm that's been around bitcoin for a while.

The big problem is that people don't make a plan before investing their hard earned money. However, if you own Bitcoin because of reasons outside of money then I guess I understand. But people need to make a plan. It's not about ATH, it's about what is sufficient for each and one of us. Yet some make unreasonable goals. That tells me two things. Either they have no experience in the markets, or they read bias research. 
You must choose your two P's. If you're in it for potential and performance, then make a damn plan and do your research. If you're in it for for passion and possession, then there is no reason to be watching the price when you should be watching the git.

Bitcoin Suisse always had great intentions to Bitcoin and the Crypto-Market. Many people don't know this, but they offer great research. This is basically their motive. Informing people.

I don't bother reading articles from reddit anymore because I feel that it is manipulated. I only read the articles on reddit from sources I am familiar with. It's actually sad that some good quality content gets downvoted to oblivion. It's mostly a bunch of accounts that have an interest in the article source website, so they all upvote it.
