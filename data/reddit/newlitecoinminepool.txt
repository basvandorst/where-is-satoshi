Imho your dad's a smart man. 
Imho btc Will have a 180k price pump in Dec 2018 with a 100k price tag. 
Be sure your long term holding as much as you can. Don't spent initial profits on scaling too much / + power. 
It's the deflation you guys want. So have a good saving/  scaling plan based on a long term / sharp increase. 
Mine into a no profit area then rebuy next gen equipment if you have too. 
But save everything for dec-
Thank me later and pm me. 
Would love to keep up with your boys's saga :)

I think people aren't attuned to how many millionaires there are in the united states alone, and how finite a commodity that bitcoin actually is. 
Billions of dollars are spent and wasted daily these days. Bitcoin's being a million dollar bargaining chip will come sooner then you know with long term holders and ghost coins making the coin grow in rarity. 
I worked at a yacht club. Overheard a conversation once in the lobby. 
"I just did a three million dollar remodel on my boat." *(Me: totally wondering in awe what his house, and car looks like?).*
Millionaires need bargaining chips. That aren't property's and paintings. 
'Word of mouth' will also ultimately take off with another five years running. 
Mining now is a very intelligible venture. 
Run 20 antminer s9's. That's some 40k a month. 
Imo the markets stagnant. It's a slow climb. But that's probably a pretty accurate comparison - /+ to the scaling with lightning, batch payments, and segwit going full network-
Twitch with Amazon is already on amd a good solid growth might just get em all the way in. 
Never know whose signin in but even mark Cubans selling loot lol. 
So ya. I don't think 30million to 100million in 30 years is too far off. Should ultimately nothing go wrong. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:07:48
I honestly think it's a good fairy tale but ultimately I doubt it will have a happy ending. 
Alts are more likely to fail now due to bull runs for "gains". Which impact their security. If the markets only in it for a profit the real ico's will get slaughtered out by the scammers, driving users away. Eventually even solid ico's won't have the market interest of succeeding. 
Discouragement will detract future developers from technoogy adaptations. 
Basically the basket will overflow ultimately, causing suicide to any niche commodity. Big or small. Unless it adequately traded directly Into btc having a multi million person / community  usership; it's network will crumble-
I see being a solid contender but ultimately I question it's its ability to outlast fall markets. 
I see many users abandoning it via mass btc bull runs-
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:43:04
I imagine if you save the appropriate amount of BTC in comparison to the data sets that you've rendered; that you will surely inherit this future-
**Hodl ;)**
@_date: 2018-01-04 05:04:03
This is stupid. 
Every alt and token isn't a 'coin'. It's a technology. 
Now from the beginning you have your long term holders. They already have established holdings in the retirement level. So they can afford to buy in at an ICO launch getting millions for pennies. 
Then you have high risk penny stock investors, and day traders making hedge bets on the launch from the side lines.
However "investors" read up on the developers, the technology and their road map. 
They decide based on public presentation. Name, and business schematics in an orderly fashion. 
You can easily make huge jumps on the right coin launches. Take those that made a million off ripple just recently. 
Day trading into % gains is essentially roulette. Don't knock it until you've researched it. Some Ico' s have really Interesting goals. (Like: polybius)
Every 'good' crypto application should have an application in the world. There are many many types of ico' s, with very different goals. 
Some can be the future of crypto. Others (many) are fakes, scams, and laughable. 
So be more open minded. Your slamming a really cool feature of our environment. No one's going to make you have it. But some of it can be quite profitable if you do your homework.
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:10:32
Dips aren't about averages and trajectory's. They are based on market influence. So you account for periods of market influence. Past volume and announcements reveling future or past interactions with the technology. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:08:21
No you create an algorithm which outcompetes reality by assessing the trajectory of available meta data sets. It's a system of mathematics in comparison to statistics. 
This is very far from warranting me a professional in grammar or speech. I assess data sets relevant to the coins technological progression, and distribution factors. As well as relevant news media, and intellectual adaptations throughout the year. Including factoring in damage mitigation periods. Growth trajectory of past data sets. 
It's kinda a bigger deal then word salad-
Take a class?
@_date: 2018-01-23 23:58:12
Technically I have I suppose... 
Yet I will likely sell most alts by November.
I will call that the 'shaken-ing'-
Hence the price increase plotted. There are many coins that will spurt this year, into irregular profit margins. Yet most everything I am not currently using on the floor is in tether, and btc. 
I have some shit erc20 tokens to boot, but half of them aren't worth the gas it takes to exchange them. I don't think many other then the top 100- cryptos will last another year. To me there are too many current indications they will fold in a mass bullrun. In addition to attempts at order and regulations within the cryptosphere. 
The elements upholding their reputations through this year are ultimately the foundation to coins reaching six figures. It's well and easily said that there truly is only 21,000,000 coins on the block chain. (Many already having value while ultimately being lost)...
So a world population of 7.4billion fairly equated to over a million per coin as the technology is recieved received by word of mouth, user share and commercial support. 
The more companies accepting it gifting it, and exchanging it as a store of value, the more it's worth by default. 
Word of mouth multiplies those figures exponentially. 
The reality is that a multi-million dollar bitcoin isn't unfathomable. It's in reality more so to be extremely likely. 
The truth is it's the modern day "Babe Ruth Card".
If you look at bitcoin as a finite commodity you understand it's worth in rarity. It isn't something that's going to be eradicated or valueless ever. Because where there is a market there is a price, which is always defined by supply and demand.
Eventually due to scarcity, prices like 5, 10, 15, 20 or even 200 million per coin aren't unimaginable. 
Rare art, expensive yachts, commercial jumbo jets, babe Ruth cards, old cinematographery, priceless artifacts. These values are determined by scarcity...
A new million dollar btc playchip is easily foreseeable with bitcoin's current distribution to profit ratio; *within 1.8-2.3 years time.*

No worries. You should be at 43.00 daily with the s'9s. Save your btc until dec- (thank me later). 
You can easily do what I am doing and crowd source investors.
It's complex and simple. 
Basically I am hoping to find 20 people with 5000.00 for a total of 100,000.00
This to set up 10. 
I have 5 techies to run gear. All with degrees, in networking and security.
So the total 25% people will all recieve a equal % no monthly. Then 15% will go towards scaling up. Until roi is established and the mining becomes no longer profitable. 
I think it's a great way to scale up fast and help those that want to mine, but can't afford it.

Well. 
Two options really. Invest in miners like us. Or buy an s9 yourself. 
If you are to believe BTC Will be at a higher evaluation per Dec2019 then I'd assume it's highly profitable. 
Your a Berkley student and A law student. So I'd assume your capable of taking a sample / forecast. 
If you want to be one of our 20. I am still drafting contracts. That's something by you can help with. It's more so a drive to move quick / and help one and other. 
My real advice. (To anyone today) is to: Buy as many s9s as you can- and now.  (But that's advice to anyone). 
Our mining team is working to have a platform (private cloudmining) setup within 45 days. +/-.

If you went to an exchange to trade against the floor its like your planning on heading into a casino to win "all the chips"-

I mean everything in life is use at your own risk. Many are using both genesis and coinbase. They are secure and 90% guaranteed- 
Just pay your taxes- 
("Makes it easier on all of us.")
Some times it's better to cycle multiple payments when dealing with such large amounts of money. At any time an exchange can go bankrupt, get hacked, fail to do a basic task etc.
Also most of the problems are with your bank and the size of the amounts of money that your moving at a time. 
So ya best to search for a good bank. To test a withdraw, and probably to stick to like withdraws that won't get flagged for being preposterous. You never know these days, and I'd hate to get my entire worth stick stuck in limbo.

**(plants seeds of doubt in the forum with this post)**


(No one said it was)?


All alts are 'post-dated' crypto currencies. Alt chains began circulatimg after bitcoins known scaling issues came to light. Allowing their developers to overcome initial problems with future scalin in advance. 
This does not make their cryptos more valuable, or their developers more competent. What it does is gives them a head start with their tech-
In terms of technology and investing. Most crypto alts are like videogame design companies. (I.e. EA Sports) 
However in that respect your misidentifying BTC... It isn't in this scenario ruled as an equal competitor on the market. BTC is more like SONY.
(Who developed our playstation). 
Final thoughts:
As far as I know Lightning is doing phenomenal on the Litecoin network. So I see it as a very stable and logical solution to 'this phase' of network adaption. No one should be concerned- they are a legitimate and highly skilled development team. With a solid working product...
Do more research-

Honestly not much. 
Mining pools are global now, and many of the Chinese parties operating in BTC will relocate within their soonest possible availability. 
We're talking maybe a week to two weeks tops for each pool to ship, shop, and reenter the market in a new territory. Russian farms are likely to flex their muscles, offering support, and infrastructure to the refugee miners as well. 
Because many of our pools are international collaborations. I imagine that they are already networking with a designated disaster mitigation plan. Miners scale for opposition and difficulty by nature. 
So this was expected, and there will be no real impact aside from China losing out on capital gains, and associated profits via their taxing system. 
If anything it impacts the Chinese governments infrastructure and their citizens trust in government 100% more then it will ultimately ever effect the btc networks. 
Let alone it is sudden moves like these that stimulate antisemitic hate between citizens and government. Being bitcoin is a relatively healthy commodity, and opportunity for its users. 
I see this leading to protests in China. With citizens there attempting to push for mass adoption, and acceptances in their local communities. 
Ultimately when you ban something that the people want and desire. It's their anger that leads to improvements and resolutions. 
Hope that helps:)

Actually we are trained data technician's who use thousands of fact's, and factors to draw a conclusion on futures/events. 
We make an assessment ruled in damage mitigation, basing this on the traditional vector of growth in comparable years. While assessing the month to month traffic of users; highest and lowest periods of new user growth; relationships with past similar data sets, and any similar projects which reflect the current trajectory of a fund/currency.
A large part of our work is comparative analytics. However the more experienced that an analyst is (versatility in data sets). The more effective their  
General worth and experience is in our field. 
I did news analysis for several years. This has genuinely helped me with my personal understanding of btc.

Doubt this will work lol- 
Maybe its best to just power house and gain signatures. Then make some demands using unilateral strikes if requests aren't met.

Coinbase is saturated. Give em room to breathe. That really sums it up. 
Great site. Doing a lot. Bummer-
Things Will be ok though, so just breathe!

If not coin base then try genesis. Also some exchanges also sell USD direct to btc.
I suggest everyone 'Bookmark'
It has a list of [Exchanges]( and [Vendors]( *(for multiple coins)*. 
They recently emailed subscriber's, that they are about to do major updates on the site this year. 
*(So the forums currently offline)*. 
**Good site for beginners though-**
Bookmarking it as a resource is highly recommended!

That isn't the holders. That's the new money weak hands from Christmas buying into the XRP AND BCH' S PR and social media teams.
Someone tried to tip me that crap then their tip bot crashed- lmao--
The above user is right. We're in a price adjustment for whales / long term holders. It's January, and until March its well known were dealing with a negative "story hungry media cycle" and a "stagnant market". 
Segwit2x will likely launch in March and we Will see a 24-30k price tag. Likely a steady 18% monthly increase leading into Dec from there. 
Go ahead and trade out on a low if of your so confident in alts. Have fun with that lol. 
Just don't say we didn't want you-

I'd not ship the item until the funds arrive / fully confirm-
Once they are confirmed it's your crypto-
The amount your receive is a permanent amount of btc with fluctuating value. (I'd request that they be sure that they pay the additional mining  few fee on their end).
Otherwise you are good!
P.s. save until December, thank me later.

Except when you make a lot of money-
A very berry lot of lot of warm and fuzzy monies-
I agree: 
Follow the news, stay informed on the segwit 2x and lightning network implementation... continue to expect more large scale tech integrations, fortune 500's and various international agencies to adapt to BTC. 
Keep your ear to the ground and invest in the coins future. Not it's its current need cycles which will always ultimately have an ulterior motive and agenda.

Block could have been 90% hashed. 
Blockchain is a hashing process. Miners have to mine your transactions-
Where  they are in terms of 'hashing' their blocks, is where your money is- If you are absolutely sure the address is right, then Simply have patience-
You can look your transaction up via the block chain if there is a problem, beyond a 2 weeks wait time. (Sometimes payments aren't  always fast) and in the mean time you can also contact binances customer support if they have made an error on their end. (Reporting the payment)-
Another thing is they may have a preset filter on their site: on how much, and how often you can move funds into, and out of wallets. (To stop hacking attempts). 
So calm down and just Google your transaction. Contact binances and be patient. (Things Will be ok.) 
Read up on how mining works in the  mean time. You shouldn't be so misinformed / weary. Reading and researching bitcoin's technology will help you to be more confident and informed in the future. 
Hope that helps.

I doubt we will floor under 8000.00 in January/February- The only way we could factually hit in the 6000.00's would be due to inside trading and corruption; in which case I hope that the Fed's kick in his door Allah Martha Stewart style-
Unless an emp Hits, or global legal cables BAN it in 25% of its operating territory, I am 100% with you!
My recent plotting was a 180k December market evaluation.
Feel free to (remind me in 1 year).

To get my first ever BTC, I signed a friend up to coinbase with my refferal account in November 2017. Since receiving that 10.00 in btc- in December 2017. I will allow you to do the exact math on my recieved roi. But off hand it's nearly 1000.00 present day. 
If you can't wait a year to make profit via market deflation then investing in virtually 'anything' isn't for you-
If you want to make money off btc daily I'd suggest trading, faucets, and refferal programs. 
However, you don't encompass the knowledge and discipline necessary to make it far and it's been warned: "That the 'Stock Market' is nothing more than a 'device' used for transferring money from the 'impatient' to the 'patient'. 
So here is my advice. 
Read your ass-off, until 'you're' the one answering these questions.
Look into new coins, learn to trade, sign up to exchanges, diversify daily and reset your portfolio ahead of time by monitoring the news and members that are promoting their technologies. 
That is the best method you can take to gaining your financial freedom.
Then learn what scaling is, and  continue to reinvest your profits into your own virtues and varieties-
Maybe you will not ever become a bitcoin millionaire- however that doesn't  stop you from making your first 100.00 in BTC, and trading it for Microsoft stock options and so on...
That being said my last advice. Stop wasting time-
**Make today your bitch-**

The only people that I can imagine are factually worried; are the same ones that can't discern. PR Agents &amp; 'Social Media Teams', from actual 'Real People' online-
*"Thats That's why they call it corraling sheeple"*.
Buy XRP and BCH! Narf!!!- 
*"cause well the markets stagnant so give us your money!!! We will be epic! Pinky promise! and thanks for your bitcoin!*"
(Like: 'Litecoin' didn't exist prior to both them, and out-compete them from the starting line)- *cough*

The best way to describe this is by telling the person you're talking to that in short people are idiots. Bullruns are rampant in any real and new good commodity / stock. *(these determine the price)*. Christmas was expected, the block chain needed to catch up on implementing lightning network amd there were also delays in segwit. However, the developers and mining platforms are currently building on the framework. So bitcoin's nowhere near 'dead'; and these are nothing more then fringe benefits users are guaranteed when investing in the future technology that is bitcoin.
Learn to read it like it is. The graph is a Marco curve. Another 'halvening will occur soon' among a new batch tier of mining difficulty. The more we advance the less we have in our way. New mining pools and nodes are making way everyday with lightning. 1000 nodes currently support the tech. 
Amongst That, robin hood is also launching. Opening up a whole new array of potential to crypto users. Gains will be on track again. By summer were likely to see near 100% segwit and lightning adaption. Flawless transaction times, and lower fees. 
People will come flocking back. Most alts will tank. And I will be having yet another smashing bitcoin Christmas with my family again.
