I am putting money on Acquiesced. Because I didn't know that word.

You do whatever you feel is correct according to the rules you live by and let everyone else do the same. 'I' don't need your moral guidance.
Oh god, infinite loop.

I demand that you ignore my demands.

Remember people, we still have a bunch of questions needed to be answered. Regardless of your opinion of the ethics of unauthorized access to information owned by someone you don't like, it is important we remain civil and follow reddit rules.
Also, to note whilst this appears to be legit data it is apparent that this is Mt. Gox's internal accounting. If there is issues with this it still is within the bounds of what we have been told.

It is much more of a glide.

Poor Bitcoin, only went up 3000%.

Just hold on to it buddy, forget you have it and check back in a few months.
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:38:13
I understand what you mean, but this is phrased very badly.

It is decided, I am having stuffed potato for dinner, bacon, sour cream and chives with some salad. 
Thank you internet stranger for solving my dinner conundrum.
