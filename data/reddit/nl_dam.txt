it is not

Yeah just hodl. Look at the past: It is only a minor correction. Just look at the last month or even the last week. It will be fine. And yes, buy a hardware wallet, now.

Interesting. And the problem they try to solve is called HashCash? I'm not entirely sure if I understand how it works.
Thanks for taking the time to explain

Thank you

I'm sorry, I was approaching this from the '1 miner to overthrow all others' perspective. When you look at the current situation in which new chips quickly render all older tech useless the scenario is very much likely.

There is simply no other digital currency that is as widely used and integrated at this point in time. Through network effects, we’re starting to see exponential growth, which creates value as more and more people start using Bitcoin and more merchants accepting it as a means of payment.
Today, there are already thousands of merchants around the world accepting Bitcoin as a means of payment, thus proving the growing usefulness of it.

Hi mysticherbalist, take a look at the Block Explorer API. It is located:    (the /q is intentional)

"can i buy an asic and start mining today?"
You can, nobody will stop you.
"High fees - will i ever be able to send 5 $ on the internet with bitcoin ?"
You are already able to do so right now. However the network has slowed down considerably and the transaction fees are unattractive to do so.
Regarding the high fees: Several factors cause the transaction fees to be so high. One factor is the limited number of transactions that can be processed at any time. When there are too many transactions to process miners will frequently process the transactions that pay a higher fee before the transactions with lower fees.
Another factor is competing cryptocurrencies that cause miners to switch away from Bitcoin. Whenever this happens the network slows down and the transaction fees rise.
There are solutions. A step has been taken with SegWit which paves the way for the Lightning Network. Another solution would be increasing the block size.
It should be noted however that paying a fee that's too high is unnecessary, as it doesn't carry any additional benefit. But paying too small a fee means your transaction won't go through fast, or at all.
I hope this helps

It will drop is my guess. No need to panic. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:31:13
And then what?

"Secondly if someome wants to send me send me 1 bitcoin do i give them my bitcoin wallet address?"
You give them your public address

Is GDAX different from regular exchanges like Kraken, Bitfinex, etc? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:37:26
That wasn't so long ago :) 
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:47:44
I don't think anyone is ignoring this.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:01:20
Totally jinxed it

The way I see it the following would happen: Every so many blocks the difficulty of mining a block is evaluated because the rate at which blocks are mined should stay the same no matter the computing power you throw at it. If someone would start a powerfull enough 'super miner' the difficulty would spike up to the point where all other (old) miners are not powerfull enough anymore to be useful for mining. A very very unlikely scenario though.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:26:44
How does the difficulty go up? The underlying algorithm stays the same right? Who decides if the difficulty should go up or down? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:01:57
Get used to this, it will happen again, more then once.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:35:37
How come the time between bitcoins being mined stays the same no matter how much miners there are? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:36:24
The fastest and cheapest transaction fee is currently 930 satoshis/byte. For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, this results in a fee of 210,180 satoshis. This would translate to roughly 35 dollars.

So the hashing algorithm is used to mine a block. In a block the transactions are stored, right? I am missing where the hashing comes into play. If I understand correctly the hashing algorithm uses a nonce and some random data as input, correct?

there are libraries that can produce correct keys from xprv string (chain m/iH/0/k with hardened keys according to BIP0032) -  for Python.
