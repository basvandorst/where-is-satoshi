The risk is not from being individually targeted by another person (another risk that happens as crypto gains value), but software that indiscriminately spreads and waits for the individual to open their wallet software.

I just did some light research because I was wondering the same thing, but from what I understand a paper wallet is as simple as (1) bitcoin address and the (1) private key to spend it.  So 2 strings of data, represented as QR codes.
There are a couple of websites to generate paper wallets, a google search links to  and  .  Both are opensource projects comprised of a webpage+javascript that can be downloaded to your desktop and ran offline, which is encouraged.  
As far as transferring funds, most (maybe all of the modern ones) wallet software have a feature to **sweep** the funds.  For example, according to the Trezor developer here ( all you need to do is use Electrum with your Trezor to do so.  I also tested the iOS wallet Copay and the scanning feature allowed me to sweep random private keys I found on google images, so now I know it works in practice.
Sweeping is when you send 100% of the funds in a paper wallet into your next wallet.  This is what you want instead of importing.  I suppose this is analogous to depositing a bank cheque (sweeping) vs storing the cheque in your pocket (importing).
I hope this helps.  I can't believe it's taken me this long to figure out paper wallets.  I was worried at first because I've heard of the potential risks like spending from a paper wallet (discouraged because if you spend less than 100% of the funds, the difference goes into a change address you don't have the private key to) or using an import feature -- and losing the private key when migrating between wallets (funds you must keep track of since they are unspent).  It seems like the bitcoin wallet ecosystem recognizes this and prefers the user to sweep funds instead.

The precautions for crypto should be higher because the individual is their own bank.  On the other hand, credit cards are just that, a line of credit.  There are regulations/policies put in place to protect consumers in case of theft of credit.  An individual can go through designated channels to resolve this and they are not on the hook for the cost.
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:40:05
This one should do the trick 
@_date: 2017-09-04 02:13:49
So with bip38 would a user do this? :
1. Generate a paper wallet
2. Apply a bip38 passphrase
3. Send you the resulting encrypted private key (begins with 6P...) and public address
When the user wants to redeem the wallet, use a tool like bitaddress.org to decrypt it with their secret passphrase.
@_date: 2017-09-28 05:09:40
I feel like this is the wrong way to look at bitcoin.  If you're looking for an amazing return on investment, people should invest in themselves via education or start a business (edit-or follow your passions, w/e fulfills you).
If 10% gains is not a % you are happy earning, your savings are probably more useful if it remains cash rather than locked up in your portfolio.
btw I saw your other post and I don't mean this as an attack on you, hell I don't know you or your situation.  But I have friends who recently "bought in" despite the fact I have been in this space for a long time and been available for question if they had any and your comment kind of reminded me of that.  They might have "bought in" but I don't think they comprehend the potential that blockchain could have.  Bitcoin is simply a use case that is performing well and they see it as a get rich scheme.

A sort of "latent function" in sociology terms, so I can agree with you there.

No, only access to both blockchains. They will later determine which nomenclature to use. I don't know how they will handle trading after the fork, maybe they have stated how somewhere else or TBD
@_date: 2017-10-09 02:24:50
 you will have access to Bitcoin on both blockchains

How much space does a pruned blockchain occupy?  I've tried keeping a node running with the blockchain on a NFS share but eventually Bitcoind would throw up errors and stop. I did this so the blockchain would reside on a nas storage pool instead on a VM disk. I might try it again and dedicate 1 TB and see how it goes
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:32:50
 is an online `bitcoin.conf` generator; very helpful since there is inline explination of wtf it does.
 this section was also helpful for listing all the RPC methods (commands to interact with bitcoind).  I really don't like how the wiki is formated though, it's difficult to navigate and not indexed by google at all.  Googling the RPC methods usually links you to a stackexchange question or a bitcoin.it wiki article instead.
@_date: 2017-10-14 18:26:49
Did you use a passphrase with the seed?
I'm not familiar with Jaxx but I think deterministic wallet software lets you use an additional password/passphrase (eg the "13th" word seed in your case)

Well I wouldn't invoke pascal's wager without some context, so let me explain where I'm coming from:
I've noticed more and more comments from redditors inexperienced with crypto asking what the hell is this all about.  I usually assume most are millennials and *have* heard about bitcoin before.  Maybe in 2011, maybe from last week's r/all post.  The curiosity usually starts with "could I become a millionaire too?  can I mine them myself?" but eventually they've seen enough "death of bitcoin" headlines while doing a 50-open-chrome-tabs click-fest to come to the conclusion that it's likely that blockchains will be a *thing* and never go away.
Arriving at that understanding, would they place a wager now or later?

There was a reddit front page post on this topic iirc. A local said the same thing about these bond notes, how it has been abused and they are undergoing another round of hyper inflation

With the information that is available now, is there an over view of the possible outcomes?  I remember seeing a post like this but I can't find it. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 23:49:47


Most people are optimistic to the point that in the future it will be ubiquitous much like email, and buying in now is a cheap and early bet.  A sort of pascal's wager.

I only have a shallow understanding of bip32/39/44 but I think the software should be able to generate the needed private key from the recovery key (mnemonic) 
This is a guess but when bip44 says   


at account' path, private keys are generated here ?
In the example of breadwallet, I'm assuming there is only 1 account and so there is only 1 private key but I have no idea.  
Here's a script I put together sometime ago to help me understand hd wallets, maybe it'll help 
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:32:18
Not sure how true that is.   states they were aware of the launderer for some time, but could not publicly share information.
@_date: 2017-07-24 23:58:00
I think breadwallet adheres to bip39 so you can probably derive it with bx 
edit-breadwallet released before bip44 so the derivation paths are different from other mainstream hd wallets
 is another useful tool that does the same thing instead of piping through bash

so soon after a chain split, if a person sent a payment to an address with a private key they control, they would theoretically hold balances on both chains?

Wow, nice job.  I don't have the skills to do that so I'll probably buy one from aliexpress.  I have a spare ssd and a usb3-sata3 cable ( if it works, it'll be messy and if not, I'll have to find a powered usb hub.  But I really like how everything is compact in your build.  It took me awhile to realize that the WD PiDrive powered both the drive and the rpi.  Really clean!

I've been thinking about buying a small computer to hack around with, like an intel nuc or raspberry pi, but I've never seen one with a case and screen included.  Very cool!
