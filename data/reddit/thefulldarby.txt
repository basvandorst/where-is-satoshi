That makes sense. Unlikely 2.8 people decided to buy Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:41:09
Can anyone explain how to read buy/sell walls? Or link to a source that can explain? I've read a few things online but it's just not making sense so far (probably more my inability to grasp the concept then a comment on the quality of what I was reading)

Nope. Many, many people have posted this same type of post this year. "Was I stupid to buy at $3k", "Was I stupid to buy at $5k", etc. None of them regret it now!
Of course, no one can predict the future. It could be lost. Just make sure you purchase responsibly.

GREAT explanation. Gemini is where I'm going to go. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:35:55
Awesome, thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:08:34
May I ask for more detail on this? I was along for the ride but never fully understood what happened. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:24:09
Just the answers I was looking for. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:58:27
Excellent explanation!
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:12:17
Hold your funds. Bitcoin is a wild ride but he one constant in the last few years is that it recovers from dips quickly and them some. If you panic sell you will regret it later.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:27:57
Awesome, thanks for the explanation!
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:37:27
Good to know. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:36:06
Honest question: why Gemini?
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:17:38
That is very interesting. Thanks for the detailed explanation!
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:16:38
AWESOME, will definitely do this. Don't want to pay another dime of fees to Coinbase. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:42:51
Did you sell? If not then it has a chance to recover. It may take a bit but there is a chance. Don't panic just yet; Bitcoin has had massive swings in it's history before.

I think I'm getting it! So right now it says that roughly 1k in BTC must be bought before it breaks through the wall. So once that number hits 0, then the price will rise above 18k?
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:24:20
Good to know. Thanks!

BNB = Binance?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:37:29
Hodl. It may correct (especially now that Coinbase seems to be down), but it is just as likely that if that happened, it would correct back up to where it is now in a short amount of time.

I'm looking at open orders at $17,395. How come the market size can change so drastically? It can go from 2.12 or so to 0.1 at the same price in a split second.
Thanks for your help btw!
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:53:02
Awesome, thanks for the clarification!
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:27:29
This is an awesome resource you've built. Thank you very much for your hard work!
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:12:52
That's exactly what I wanted to know. I bought at about $6k, now that they're at $7.7 (and still growing!) I may make 33% on the investment before the funds are even available. Thanks everyone!
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:38:04
Looks like I had to have activated it before the transaction for it to work. Oh well, now I know for next time. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-17 19:27:29
Awesome; this answered all my questions. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:28:40
That was it. Thanks!
