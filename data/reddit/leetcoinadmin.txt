We would love to speak with you guys. We are building a platform for real-time competitive gaming for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-09-09 03:31:15
Dota is definitely on our radar!
@_date: 2014-09-08 16:35:00
Not yet. We are focusing on PC for now. Mobile will be next and then console.
@_date: 2014-09-27 07:08:57
Just fyi we have a sub at @_date: 2014-02-01 00:50:48
Those two games in particular - probably. We have a long list of games that we plan to support eventually. I'll go ahead and add those to our list. :)
@_date: 2014-09-08 23:55:48
What we mean by "betting on yourself" is simply that both teams put money on the table (the table being our service), and then the winner takes it. Opposing parties compete for each other's money.
@_date: 2014-06-20 07:30:11
Lots of cool stuff in the works :)
@_date: 2014-05-26 21:33:49
Awesome product. Glad to see these finally getting produced!
@_date: 2014-09-26 22:53:55
Not yet. This is on our roadmap though.
@_date: 2014-09-26 21:19:52
Our beta went live today leetcoin.com
@_date: 2014-09-08 16:52:05
Keep practicing! We have been focusing on support for League, but CSGO is still being worked on. We are a bootstrapping startup hoping to support many games and integrate with many others with our API in the future.
@_date: 2014-09-27 01:48:11
Not yet, but it is on our radar. We want to support every popular competitive video game.
@_date: 2014-09-08 16:47:04
Riot reached out to us! ;)
@_date: 2014-10-06 19:43:55
Our API lets game devs do just that: 
@_date: 2014-09-08 16:34:00
Thanks for the mention!
@_date: 2014-09-26 21:18:51
We launched today! Check it out leetcoin.com
@_date: 2014-09-26 21:54:34
I'm not 100% sure what you're asking, but I'll try to address what you seem to be saying.
Primarily, we are an API. It just so happens that we built our own support for League of Legends in this case, using Riot's API to validate match results. Ideally, support for our platform will be integrated natively into games by developers, and they will be able to make it a much more convenient user experience that way. There are tons of possibilities for different implementations…whether it's per-kill, per-match, team-based rewards, or fully automated tournaments.
FYI, our API is already out, and if anyone is interested, they can develop with it: 
@_date: 2014-01-10 23:47:39
That's our goal!
@_date: 2014-09-27 05:00:47
Oh we're definitely familiar with Star Citizen…it looks incredible. We actually met one of the guys on their team at SXSW. He seemed interested. We'll probably reach out to them again.
@_date: 2014-09-28 05:47:57
Players can play against other players for bitcoins. Two teams or individuals can join or create a match, buy-in, play, and we validate the match results. The winner's account is deposited with the other player(s) buy-in fee.
@_date: 2014-09-27 07:18:05
We agree completely and that is why we are so in love with this concept. Big implications!
@_date: 2014-09-27 01:57:30
It depends on the game, but something like this could be implemented with our API. By supporting League of Legends, we want to get people thinking about what is possible. But the end game is that game developers can build support for our platform directly and seamlessly into their games.
Our API is already available: 
@_date: 2014-09-26 23:46:10
If you don't feel comfortable linking your google account (we can't access any of your information), you can create another one for free specifically for our platform.
After you select the account you want to use, there is a page (from Google), which tells you exactly the information we are requesting. The only info we request is your email address. We use Google login for convenience.
@_date: 2014-09-27 07:06:55
While building on top of existing games is great (obviously that's what we're doing with League of Legends), ultimately our vision is for developers to build our API directly into their games, which will allow for a more convenient and seamless experience for the user. We're hoping that our implementation of our API with League will inspire some of that. :)
@_date: 2014-09-08 16:36:08
We are SC2 fans too! It's on our roadmap.
@_date: 2014-04-06 11:37:23
Awesome! We are working with a few other eSports leagues and will reach out to Axiom.
@_date: 2014-09-26 23:35:48
@_date: 2014-09-08 23:03:26
Our platform allows players to bet on themselves before the match begins and is fully automated. This is the difference between skill-based gaming and traditional gambling.
@_date: 2014-02-01 02:38:37
Maybe sometime in the future. :)
@_date: 2015-03-25 02:58:09
That's what we're working on!
@_date: 2015-03-24 17:49:38
Some US States are blocked. Our FAQ lists them here 
@_date: 2015-03-25 08:07:11
Currently, we offer low stakes and promo servers. On promo servers you can log on for free and receive 1,000 per kill with no death penalty.
@_date: 2015-03-25 02:56:56
Leetcoin is a skill-based eSports platform where players can compete against each other in their favorite video games for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-03-27 07:43:36
We are starting to focus more on user acquisition so this should be less of a problem going forward. 
Leetcoin Steam Group - 
@_date: 2015-03-24 17:47:26
We are looking into World of Tanks and other popular titles.
@_date: 2015-02-17 18:07:52
Don't worry, we work very closely with our attorneys. :)
@_date: 2015-03-24 17:46:19
EU servers will be up very soon!
@_date: 2015-03-27 06:33:57
Thanks! Please feel free to reach out to us with any thoughts, comments or concerns.
@_date: 2015-02-17 09:40:13
Riot was excited about Leetcoin, and gave us the key to this api. Few people have their permission to use this api. Legally, Leetcoin is considered skill based gaming, not gambling.
@_date: 2013-10-25 00:29:45
@_date: 2013-06-24 00:11:05
Thank you to everybody who was able to play in the match!
@_date: 2013-09-22 03:29:22
It is automatically tracked on the backend in real-time. Right now we are operating on a per kill/death wager.
@_date: 2013-06-21 19:44:38
We will be implementing many different types of play in the future. Right now it is simply .01 for each kill/death.
@_date: 2013-09-21 21:00:40
Exactly what we're going for.
@_date: 2013-10-25 00:38:30
We use every preventable measure to safeguard against hackers. Our fail safe in any event of suspected cheating, is that we are able to freeze a player’s account until further investigation has taken place.
@_date: 2013-10-13 01:43:49
Just spread the word about us!
@_date: 2013-04-29 13:46:08
Our servers are password protected, have Valve Anti-Cheat running, and are monitored by admins. Any cheaters will be permanently banned and will not be able to withdrawal from their account until an investigation has been finalized.
@_date: 2013-04-28 23:09:36
Email us at admin and I'll add you to the list.
@_date: 2013-10-12 23:12:18
BF3 is a possibility in the near future.
@_date: 2013-10-12 23:11:53
These are in our future pipeline.
@_date: 2013-07-09 10:40:30
We can't either ;)
@_date: 2013-10-22 03:32:27
Soon enough!
@_date: 2013-09-22 03:27:05
Open source games are definitely in the pipeline.
@_date: 2013-10-22 03:02:11
Noted. Thanks for your input.
@_date: 2013-10-11 18:19:10
Check us out  We are launching closed beta this weekend.
@_date: 2013-10-14 19:04:48
Thanks for the interest pietrod21!
Our website is being redesigned and we are putting together a FAQ, etc to help explain our service better for everyone.
In a nutshell, here's how it works:
1. Log-in with your Steam ID on our website 
2. Deposit bitcoin into your account. We recommend at least .01 -.02 BTC because of our current server settings.
3. Once your bitcoins have hit your account (should be almost instant) you can select under "Supported Games" Counter-Strike Source. Select our server to authorize it for as much of your balance as you would like. Again, we recommend at least .01 BTC or 1,000,000 satoshi.
4. Use the IP given on the server page to connect and play. Each death is posted as a negative .001 to your authorized amount. Each kill is posted as positive .001 minus the server fee.
It's that simple. You can disconnect, deauthorize, and withdrawal at any time.
Here is a video of in-game BTC balance change - 
If you have any trouble or questions, please don't hesitate to contact us at admin
@_date: 2013-04-28 21:14:05
We're glad to provide!
@_date: 2013-06-21 13:18:02
VAC and cross referencing an updated global ban list. User's bitcoins are held with us in escrow. If they are suspected of cheating, hacking or any other foolery their accounts will be frozen until an investigation takes place. 
@_date: 2013-10-12 23:11:26
You only lost 100,000. If you're authorized amount goes under 1,000,000, you are automatically kicked. You should still have a balance of 900,000 in your account. You can contact us directly at admin
@_date: 2013-09-21 21:01:35
This will be implemented soon after.
@_date: 2013-10-16 02:51:11
We are looking into open platforms like Ouya.
@_date: 2013-10-12 23:07:39
This is in our pipeline.
@_date: 2013-10-12 23:11:37
Same as above:
You only lost 100,000. If you're authorized amount goes under 1,000,000, you are automatically kicked. You should still have a balance of 900,000 in your account. You can contact us directly at admin
@_date: 2013-07-09 10:46:47
We never shut down. We have been working on our platform and will be holding more beta matches in the near future.
As stated before: "VAC and cross referencing an updated global ban list. User's bitcoins are held with us in escrow. If they are suspected of cheating, hacking or any other foolery their accounts will be frozen until an investigation takes place."
@_date: 2013-10-14 20:32:32
You can deposit as little as .003, but if you die once you'll get kicked automatically. As stated above, it's recommended to deposit at least .01 - .02 BTC into your account. 
@_date: 2013-10-14 20:30:06
We are putting up a HD video soon. As stated above, our current server is set at .001 for each kill/death
@_date: 2013-10-22 01:37:07
We're going to announce a specific time for everyone to connect closer to the date.
@_date: 2013-10-15 00:57:34
Totally understandable. We are in closed beta right now so technically only a limited amount of people are authorized to play. We are opening it up slowly though and adding more players now.
@_date: 2013-12-28 19:13:34
We are still in beta. More games and game types will be available next year.
@_date: 2013-09-22 03:23:19
Quake is being looked into.
@_date: 2013-10-10 02:58:16
This is in our future pipeline.
@_date: 2013-10-12 23:13:35
Thanks for the post HostFat. If anyone has any questions or problems, please contact us at admin
@_date: 2013-10-15 14:48:53
The beta server running is setup as .001 per kill/death.
@_date: 2013-10-25 00:31:32
We use every preventable measure to safeguard against hackers. Our fail safe in any event of suspected cheating, is that we are able to freeze a player’s account until further investigation has taken place.
@_date: 2013-07-09 10:50:26
CS:GO, Source, and 1.6 will be supported first. We have a list of other games that will follow after.
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:31:27
CS:GO and 1.6 will be next. TF2 and other game types will be developed after. We are aiming for middle of Feb for TF2 specifically.
@_date: 2013-10-13 14:16:17

Absolutely. Please email me at king
@_date: 2013-09-21 15:34:10
Counter-Strike: Source first, CS 1.6 to follow, and then CS:GO and Battlefield 3.
@_date: 2013-10-15 14:47:58
Hmm interesting. First time we've had someone bring this up. Please contact admin if it persists.
@_date: 2013-10-13 18:27:22
Check out 
@_date: 2013-10-12 23:09:17
Yes. We support Counter-Strike: Source currently. 1.6 and GO are coming online in the near future.
@_date: 2013-07-09 10:48:08
Please view above regarding cheating.
@_date: 2013-07-09 10:52:37
We use real-time stat tracking to capture all of the player info.
@_date: 2013-04-29 00:57:47
It's about time, right?
@_date: 2013-10-15 16:24:49
In the works ;)
@_date: 2013-04-28 21:13:05
Here's a good reason to get better at them now!
@_date: 2013-10-09 21:46:53
CS:GO will be available shortly after.
@_date: 2013-10-13 00:50:15
You should be seeing this now - 
This was a error earlier that has been resolved.
@_date: 2013-04-29 02:42:50
Thanks for the comment! Not every game will be calculated quite the same. More details on this will be available in the near future.
@_date: 2013-10-22 01:34:02
We are focusing on FPS for now, but in the near future we will be supporting all genres. SC2 is on our list.
