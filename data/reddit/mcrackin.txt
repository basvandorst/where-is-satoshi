Why not invest in electric cars or something? At least that way your capital is helping the technology become reality. Investing in bitcoin does nothing for the technology. If anything hoarding it and not transacting will just diminish it's value.

I'm a finance student and work in finance so I understand your "buy low sell high" mentality. But is Bitcoin something we can prescribe to this traditional way of trading? If we take a step back and look at one Bitcoin, how do we know it has an intrinsic value of $300? The only reason why I would buy a Bitcoin right now at $300 is if I thought I could sell it later for more than $300, because it's intrinsic value is worthless other than its speculative value. Sure, US Currency is intrinsically worthless too, but the difference is that the US Government is willing to step in with the power of 350 million taxpayers backing them to keep its value stable and of worth. Bitcoin doesn't have a legal body with 350 million people backing it, it's value fluctuates so much which almost renders it useless on its own.

The difference is national currencies are currencies and bitcoin is a speculative store of value. Few people just hodl USD hoping it'll somehow increase in value. They'd rather buy a treasury bill, which is subject to taxes.

@_date: 2016-12-21 02:21:18
How's that any different from a currency that's divisible to the 100 millionth? The problem with bitcoin is there's encouragement to hold on to it so it reduces the speed of it changing hands which is what happens in a heated economy.

Most of the counties on that list use foreign currencies. So this is one of the dumbest threads of the week. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 21:12:15
So if we presume bitcoin will be subject to appreciation (the opposite of fiat money).... Is that really a good thing? You end up with a currency that is hoarded by a few, leaving future generations of people impossible to function in that currency.
@_date: 2019-02-05 02:19:49
I don't understand why the purchasing power of a currency is a metric of success. Having a dollar lose value if it's not being used is the most brilliant quality of the dollar. It forces people to use it or lose it. Bitcoin is the opposite. There's an incentive to "hodl" and just not use it because maybe the value will go up. What a great concept...
@_date: 2017-04-16 22:37:24
Do you understand what happens to money when you're saving it in the bank? Because that statement sounds like you don't have a clue.

When you close a short, assets are purchased to replace the short sale (borrowed shares). This typically increases price pressure. Why is the price dropping here?

Not sure what bank you're using, but mine let's me transfer cash to anyone with a listed bank account for free over email. You just open the email, click accept and it's deposited into your bank account. Mind you, it does take about 15 minutes before the email is sent. It'll get better.

One of the primary objectives of the fed is to target inflation at 2% and there's economic rationale behind why that is a good thing.
@_date: 2017-04-16 19:12:29
There's many, but one important effect is that there's an incentive not to hold on to cash and put it to work either by spending it or investing in other businesses. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 01:33:31
Disagree. I work for an oil major and we're joining a consortium of companies to investigate the use of Blockchain to facilitate the thousands of payments we make to each other on a daily basis. May even go as far as to require third party vendors to use the technology if they want to do business with us. Completely cut out the cost of banking and reduce our treasury costs. The best part is we don't need to buy any pre-existing crypto-currency and drain our coffers... that defeats the purpose. We just make our own "currency"  - that is the future. You guys are already falling behind this fast moving train.

Is your measure of success of bitcoin it's value?

I disagree bitcoin has any value because the technology is open to anyone. It's like diamonds. Made up value through marketing. Except now China can create diamonds indistinguishable to De Beers mined diamonds and will soon be worthless. Except obviously crypto is much easier to improve upon.
Why would industry adopt a preexisting crypto? Why not have their own crypto coded to suit their needs? Why would they pay some dumb kids real currency when they could just pay a company to make them one?

I don't think that is the point of the article, but you are touching on something OP would rather ignore as he's obviously posting the article under the claim that Bitcoin is superior to the US Dollar.
It appears OP is claiming the US dollar is "volatile" much like Bitcoin - but this is far from the truth. The US Dollar depreciates at a fairly constant rate, especially since inflation targeting policies became more prevalent over the past 10-20 years. The fact that the US Dollar can now be expected to deflate in value by approximately 1-3% every year is an extremely powerful attribute to a currency and probably why the US Dollar is retaining its absolute dominance over the world today. Nobody knows what's going to happen to Bitcoin...whether it will go up, go down, or cease to exist in 10 years. There's no legal authority to back it up if shit goes awry, nobody committed to its existence.
I will say this, that it's also extremely powerful to know exactly how much supply will exist for a currency for it's entire history like Bitcoin. The problem is for someone willing to loan another money, holding supply fixed, other variables determine it's value. A banker isn't interested in working with a currency where its value is determined by weird factors like population, technology etc. With the US Dollar, bankers know that the central authority will maintain its deflationary value somewhat constantly over long periods of time. 
When a banker decides to issue a 30-year mortgage denominated in Bitcoin, let me know.

Define "outperformed."
There's a reason why businessmen don't buy the Swiss franc and get rid of all other currencies. You can't invest in Tesla or Apple or Lockheed Martin with Swiss francs or Bitcoin...you need USD. Assets owned in USD dominate the entire globe when it comes to investment opportunity. Bitcoin your money just sits in an electronic wallet and doesn't do any work.
Swiss francs have a fault that Bitcoin can relate to - volatility and unpredictability. The Swiss are notorious for pegging, non-pegging, confusing the market, and having the franc fluctuate wildly. Not good for anyone wishing to use it in a practical sense.
