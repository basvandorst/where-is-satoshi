Not with bitcoin today since we don't know if it still exists 2016. First when we know it won't dissapere it will be prised in, but you have to wait for that to happen until halvings 2020, 2024 or even later.

+ 1 milion 
This is the correct thing to do.
1. Ordinary people do not understand micro, milli, nano etc. They will not use a number of 0,0000245 to buy anything. To complex.
2. The word "bitcoin" is still used as a unit for the 21 000 000 coins of bitcoin. 
3. Up until now all buyers of bitcoin have done so buying them in the scale of "million" without beeing confused. This gives the next generation och buyers the same feeling of value, eccept they are buying bits instad of bitcoins.
4.  It devides a large number 21 million x 100 000 000 into two "equal" groups of zeros if the last 00 stands for sats just like pennies today. This is a smart way to give this very large number a fast and easy way to be handled. Large scale equals bitcoin, small scale equals bits. 
5. The word bits is not used that much for ordinary people, not everyone is a computer programmer and since it is a word thats been used before it gives bitcoin a sence of solidity.
6. It takes bitcoin a leap forward against other crypto-coins since it now is devided into understandable pieces and since it now uses one of the "original" names for spliting a value into smaller parts "bits" alt-coins will seem more confusing. 
7. Bitcoin could need a sense of escape from the word "bitcoin", it's hard for media to promote "bits" like a dirty thing since it's already in use and stands for a positive thing for most people.
8. Since bitcoin can be used in more situations than as a currency or commodity it make sence to give it a name that is not linked to the "money" function. it's more like a ledger of ownership and "bits" and "sats" would work for all situations.
9. Prices in print would look like today, a solid number and some pennies. All around the world are familiar with this allready and bicoin would seem easy to use and no one would have to use a calculator to understand the pricing. People understand the value difference between 10 and 1000, most people have not this sence for 0,1 and 0,001. 
This is an important step that has to be done. We have to make bitcoin more understandable and easy to use for ordinary people.

1 bitcoin = 1000000 bits.
The use of bits is the best way to make bitcoin understandable for regular people and solves a lot of problems regarding pricing and how easy it's to understans value. 
I like the idea that there is a large million scale (bitcoin) and a small million scale (bits), by deviding it into equal "size" numbers bitcoin gets a very easy system and we dodge the confusing idea of milli, nano, etc. That is a horrible idea.

@_date: 2014-12-18 20:37:31
More bitcoins are sold than bought, has nothing to do with the number of people selling or buying bitcoin. Since many who has held bitcoin in years has so many, even one seller can equal out hundreds of new buyers all alone. My guess is that more people are buying than selling, those few who sell though are selling a lot more coins per person. Don't mix this up, bitcoin is about bitcoin, not people.

The reality is that it will happen as long as no one finds a solution for it to never happen. Until we know how to, it's up to every single miner to start thinking about why bitcoin exist and what has to be done to make it survive. An extra 1% of daily profits is not one of them.
It doesn't matter if a large mining pool is good or evil, when bitcoin no longer is decentralized (and therefore not trusted anymore) it's over. 
You don't have to like large pools to understand reality. Now you know.

Why doesn't exchanges like Coinbase start mining bitcoin themselves to controll and prevent the 51% problem. 
By giving them a mining fee when buying bitcoins we could all controll the mining landscape by allowing them to increase the mining power and thus preventing unknown entities like GHash to evetuelly collapse bitcoin. 
If all exchanges had their own mining operation funded with our fee there would be a way to adapt the market and a way for us "non miners" to help stabilize the mining part of bitcoin. 
If mining is becoming centalized regardless, woulden't the exchanges be the ones we could trust keeping the mining in order. 
Atleast they could start their own mining pool and give it better terms than for example GHash since they already have a way to make money in their ordinary business. If someone unknown was to rapidly increase its share of mining power, exchanges could also give miners a number of bits to add miners to it's pool.
By doing this miners and buyers of bitcoin would atleast have an option that keeps bitcoin safe.

Good news is good news regardless of the value, bitcoin is not a stock in a company that rises because of good news. Bitcoin will rise in value when more people are buying it which they will as soon as there is an infrastructure around bitcoin and their fiat currency run in to some form of trouble. The infrastructure is building right now in a rapid pace, the value will rise when more currencies behaves like the ruble is right now. It's to early yet but the day will come when bitcoin increases in value again. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 13:14:32
Your right but since we now have only 6 larger mining pools controlling all mining (I think) woulden't it be better if we had these six groups and then an additional lets say ten mining pools controlled by exchanges and their ability to avoid someone els growing to rapidly. 
By supporting different exchanges, ordinary people could sponsor their mining such that it became a bit more controlled by those who we know have a revenue from bitcoin and are dependent on the survival of bitcoin. Today this seems a bit unclear.

Is it possible to buy things in dollars through Bitreserve and sidestep bitcoin in a transaction without the merchant being connected to Bitreserve first. (allowing every webshop to be used without them knowing you are using bicoin)  
or, is it a way to pay someone that doesn't want bicoin but still be able to use your bitcoin acount to do this, but only when both are connected to Bitreserve. 
If not, is Bitreserve just a way to exchange your bitcoin to a safer asset when bitcoin is losing value for a moment.

Then just say it increased from 0,9545 to 0,9563 bitcoins. Why use bits when you are so close to the bitcoin scale, doesn't make sence. Somehow these values has to be easy to read and say and with bits and bitcoin the transition between small and large numbers is easy and understandable. The use of 100000000 satoshis or millions of nanobitcoins would make our example very hard to uderstand for the costumer.

@_date: 2014-06-19 23:01:07
Don't know how to solve this but to me it seems obvious some major bitcoin exchanges should start putting some interest into controlling mining and make sure bitcoin lives on.
Bitcoin mining will become very expensive and private mining will stop being possible for most people, this is the start of centralized mining and perhaps this is not a problem at all. 
I would like to think the easiest way to keep controll of mining regardless of ever increasing cost would be to put this cost onto bitcoin itself (the price goes up but the value increases equally) and let all the exchanges run the mining since they have to be trusted to stay alive in the first place. If this centralized mining pool was somehow controlled by perhaps thousands of different exchanges but no one had controll over it by them selves the mining would still be decentralized but in a larger scale. 
Exchanges should make the mining of bitcoin a non profit part of their business and split the hash rate to keep it safe. 
Ordinary people should still be able to invest into mining gear within this pool, by owning a part of the total hash rate there could be some sort of share system but no one should be able to controll mining by himself. 
To keep the network safe the profit part by a company has to be removed.
Mining will not go back to being small scale decentralized like before, that's over.

Thats huge, if this happends 6 years from now Russia just bought every new bitcoin that the world mined today, the rest of us will be increasing it's value and Russia isn't even an important bitcoin buyer today. What if this happened to US or China, even a minor fiat problem would sky rocket bitcoins value in an hour. After 2 more halvings we will just get 900 new coins a day, today perhaps 0,1% of all Russians knows how to buy some bitcoin, what if 50% knows in 6 years. 
These numbers indicates bitcoin will rise significantly in the future. That's why we keep buying and holding on to them. You got wow right.

How hard would it be to just split all found bitcoins each day among all miners regardless of who found the bitcoins.
And put in a limit on how many block each person is allowed to be involved in each day, like if more than x % of all BTC was found by someone he will not receive any that day and his share will instead be added and split among the others.
@_date: 2014-06-08 09:31:14
The problem is no one will invest large sums of money into bitcoin if GHash or someone elso who is completely unknown once in a while rules their investment. This will never happen and bitcoin will be over.
bitcoin is no longer a free market if a mining pool is above 50%, the idea of bitcoin is to not have anyone controling it like a cental bank.

This is not a time to be idle and hoping others will solve it because then it's over, if some of the major businesses start accepting this responsibility and start planing for a way to push trough a change in the protocol we will find a more long term solution in time.

A lot of people are afraid of new technology, in time they will use bitcoin like the rest of us.

As someone reading this, I have to say anenome5 seems a bit more in balance than the rest of you.

We only know more coins are being sold, we dont know the number of people selling or buying.

Bitstamp is not bitcoin, hopefully they do it better next time.

You will have to add some zeros to get it stable. 
When you have $16600 or $166000 it will become less volatile, hold on to your coins.

My guess. One (1) whale sold some coins, ordinary buyers steps in and adopts those coins within days. Perfect adoption, perfect for the longevity of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-06 14:02:08
buy some now and wait sounds like a good thing to do, bitcoin will not go away.

How many halvings before GBTC needs all new coins avalible in todays pace?

@_date: 2015-01-31 08:53:19
Block halving is a big part of bitcoin and why some invest in it, a hard cap number of total 21 million coins and 50 % less new coins each 4 years is what gives bitcoin an advantage against all other currenies. You buy coins easy today or hard tomorrow. Without these features I for one woulden't be interested in bitcoin at all and would just keep my inflating fiat money untill it's value is inflated down to nothing like the dollar. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 18:04:27
good news for bitcoin, it needs these redistributions of coins.

Microsoft knows how to build software on top of bitcoin protocol, these two factors are easily fixed. They have two options, use bitcoin or use your own system and put it up agains bitcoin, one is easy, one isn't. 
@_date: 2015-01-10 10:40:04
Perhaps it's hard to understand why some doesn't like a world wide digital ledger that happens to have a value attached to it. Bitstamp isn't bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 19:10:45
as classic as the fiat bubble? no.

and since when is bitcoin just a currency

What use is there to own euro or dollar if the bank has put a lock on its door. 
If there is a curreny crisis it's more about trust, it doesn't matter wich one you own (owned). 
@_date: 2015-01-04 14:17:27
This will continue untill miners have emptied their stock of bitcoins from 2011-2013. This is very good for bitcoin in the long run but means the value of bitcoin will probably drop untill the next halving unless we have a major adoption increase suddenly. Right now new users doesn't buy coins as fast as miners have to sell them, this will happen in cycles. New buyers also have to cover the coins that are used in trade since 2014 has been the first year in bitcoin history it's been used (sold into fiat) so there's no way we can keep it's value in a short period of time, early adopters has to many coins from 2010-2013 to use. Some time, months or years from now bitcoin will reach equalibrium again and increase its value but this time much faster than before. It's impressive BTC has managed to hold it's value like this so far, 2014 and 2015 will be down years regarding value. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 11:59:46
A price at 100$ would be great, with a bit of luck we reach this in time for the next halving. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 18:04:06
bitcoin is the technology in use, different name, same thing.

Sorry, but you´re so new here it´s hard to take anything you say serious. Everyone here knows it´s a risky investment.

Bitcoin is much more powerfull as an inovation than BitTorrent. 
@_date: 2015-08-24 19:03:20
The world doesn't end tomorrow and it will take bitcoin some days to rise +57% if someone with a lot of money wanted it to. There also is a seed of financial crisis growing, pick up todays newspapers if you have missed it. No one here knows what will happen to bitcoin or fiat money but one of them will go to zero, you lose nothing by splitting our risks in two.

It never gets boring watching blockchain do it's work, all done by computers instead of humans.

Will this generation in greece solve this themselves or will their children have to do it for them. vote no or yes, if bitcoin goes up some $ because of them voting "no" has nothing to do with this fiat debt crisis, it's just stupid ans ignorant blaming those who happens to own some bitcoin. Everyone here hopes for the best for Greece.

And who do you have in mind. If miners don't care for bitcoin no one will, it's everybody ells we have to keep away and ignore. 
Rigs get old very quickly so new miners pops up very quickly. But only if bitcoin is healthy.

It has some of the properties that gives gold value + digital features that may make gold obsolite. The world will not look the same 2030, why not look at bitcoin a bit more open minded.

Life is longer than two years and with bitcoin there's a lot more to win than lose. Smart people buy 1 BTC just in case of moon, it will set you back 250$, it's value will be somewhere between zero and infinity.

bitcoin is even more dumb than internet
@_date: 2015-04-19 16:57:38
Price is only set according to supply and demand, you can't price in a decrease in supply untill there really is a decrease in supply. Every halving will be priced in when it happends, not one minute before.

Some will always hold on to the old world desperately, those same people was terrified of the internet 15 years ago also but we all know how easily one forgets. Don't put to much into it. Now just keep them safe and you will perhaps be one of those who made a wise decision today trying to adopt in time.

If i want something for 100$, but I buy bitcoin instead for 100$. If my 100$ in bitcoin after one year is worth 200$, why would I not buy the thing I wanted last year for free. This means I can now "hoard" my other money/savings instead of losing it. Repeat.

BTC supply and demand has nothing to do with feelings, that´s one thing that´s different from your old bank world.

No halvings are priced in since no one knows if bitcoin even exists tomorrow, price will increase if the market maintain todays level of demand for coins. A halving fifty years from now may be priced in though since bitcoin is well established then and few new coins are mined regardles of halvings or not, but we have to go through the next couple of halving before we can say they are priced in.
