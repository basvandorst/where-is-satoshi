I agree

Yeah, I can't believe its been that long since I first bought some. Looking at my purchase history, if I had kept all the BTC that I bought that year I wouldn't even have any debt right now... that 35k of student loans, car loan, and credit card debt would be a thing of the past :( Oh well, 8 more years and it will be.

I didn't even think of that. I guess it's quite a different scenario than using a groupon/livingsocial app.

My first BTC buy: 9 BTC for $28.68 total... which averages out to around $3.00 each. Man do I wish I kept them. This was in 2011.

I just bought $100 of BTC in coinbase... should I be worried? I dont mind taking a 20% hit... what are the odds this falling value is long term? slim I assume?

Damn you're a high roller! I was buying/selling that amount 2 years ago... too bad it was at ~$3 a BTC and I didn't see the huge rise in value coming.

Every time I use the groupon/livingsocial app at a restaurant the waiter either has to hold my phone and write down the number on the screen, or take my phone away to the backroom or register... it doesn't really bother me.

Amount of money is not the issue. I wanted some introspect about the MtGox, SR2 situation, and the malleability issue, and was thinking more or less of people I know whom have Bitcoin as well. I know its a huge guessing game, but after listening to the trollbox at BTC-e (which we all know rarely contains any helpful information), I was looking for a more thoughtful answer. Your response literally helps nobody. I was merely asking for opinions.

Yesterday started out at around $520 on MtGox, and ended the day around $770. It's back at $705 as of now... There is still high demand.

Lol if that works, I praise you.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:19:47
Dude I really hope you sold most of it at the $200+ point. It's absolutely TANKING today. At this point in time its at $140... down from $260 a couple hours ago.

I beg to differ. It's inflating at a rate you can definitely notice, though not in real time... I assume that's what you meant. But even year to year it's currently 1.48% over the past 11 months, that's pretty noticeable, especially when you add up the past 10 years, it's on average 2.388% a year, which is almost an 25% in 10 years. I'm talking strictly numbers here, obviously paychecks have increased in most sectors within this time frame.

Media played it up, people who had no idea what it was began throwing all their money into it. Price went way up, people who bought bitcoins cheap a few months/years ago saw this shit and decided to cash out when it went sky high. Now the people who bought them recently are also going to be selling them back to prevent a huge loss, causing the price to continue to drop. I wouldn't be surprised if we saw it back around the ~$20-$40 point by the end of the week, maybe sooner. Thats my take anyway.

I bought yesterday too at 717... just $54 thank god. I've only lost $12. I'm considering buying a little more to be honest. I really don't think it'll drop THAT much more, but of course who knows. People should treat this like any other "investment" opportunity (and not a currency, yet) and play with only money you can afford to lose. That being said, I don't think it's going anywhere and we will definitely see a rebound after Christmas/Holiday season when people get their Christmas/Holiday bonuses and whatnot. 
Edit: not investment... but you know I mean.

It's such a guessing game.
