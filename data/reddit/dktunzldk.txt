My point is I would be happy as a miner with a cheap energy source that is only available one hour per day. But yes I agree, the unseen costs of .gov money is enormous.

It's quackery. Block 78 fits the quacks narrative perfectly. Except for the fact that its output was spent (probably by hal finney) so it's counted as other instead of satoshi.

You need the functional trezor device and the PIN OR the seed.
If you lose the seed you can still access the bitcoin if you have access to the functional trezor device and the PIN.
Do not use the optional passphrase feature unless you understand it.

@_date: 2019-06-05 16:39:12
If the thief has the private key they don't need to use the blockchain.com wallet to generate the transaction, sign it with your private key, and broadcast it to the bitcoin network. They can import the private key into any wallet.
Unconfirmed transaction chains are allowed on the bitcoin network.

You can download the tool and use it on an offline computer. You don't need to be online to generate bitcoin addresses. You don't need a copy of the blockchain to generate addresses. You are generating a number that has never existed before and will never exist again unless you save it and tell someone to send bitcoin to it.

Only you can update the code that your bitcoin node uses. If you don't agree with the changes you don't update. If this results in a hard fork your balance would exist on each fork and then you can value the coins on each fork as you wish.
