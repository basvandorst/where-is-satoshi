The people that contributed to the crowdsale will be able to rent out space on their harddrives by using the Driveshare application as soon as its first version comes out (very soon). Others will be able to do the same later on when the final version is released. These people that rent out their drivespace aren´t necessarily also using as much cloud storage on Metadisk as they are offering on Driveshare, as they will be looking to make a profit by getting paid in the Storj currency called SJCX. So yes, there will be ample room for redundant data storage on the network of peers. The user decides how many copies of their files they want to maintain on the storj network for redundancy.

Well that would probably be acceptable for people that live in countries that normally use Euros, USD or GBP and only have to pay the 3% foreign transaction fee when they are travelling to a country with a different currency. For people that live in the rest of the world, this fee would be charged on every single transaction they make in their home country, and they would only benefit from the no-fee option when they actually travel to a country that uses the currency their Xapo card is denominated in. So in other words, as always people from the less developed part of the world get punished with extra charges, or they can just not use the Xapo debit card until Xapo offers a card in their native currency. I think I´ll prefer that last option.

it is not necessary to manually input bitcoin addresses. You can just copy/paste. Also, a great advantage of not giving anyone your credit card info is - well - you can´t get hacked. I´d say that´s enough to make it worthwhile. Also, there are at least 2 other bitcoin exchanges in Mexico operating just as well as Volabit: Mexbt.com and bitso.com. Deposits and withdrawals of both BTC and  fiat are very fast and customer service is good on all those interchanges. Definitely a lot better service than coinbase in the US.
@_date: 2014-08-03 13:19:20
Or in Mexican Pesos. I would probably be willing to pay the monthly fee, but 3% on every transaction just to be able to buy stuff in the country I live in, that sucks.

yes they do for people with german bank accounts. Supposedly there has been a lot of fraudulent activity with german banks. So now they asked for tier 3 verification plus a selfie of the user holding their ID. This just happened to me last week.

For some reason, the cited link  redirects to  which results in the 404 error. If you type in directly to your browser  without the www, it should take you to the correct page.

Tipping on Facebook works a little bit differently than the other social media networks.To tip on Facebook, use the "Send a Tip" tool on the ChangeTip home page.  As far as I know, it has not been banned, this was always the way it has to be done. I agree it´s not exactly convenient, but this is how it works on FB.

Please suggest how you would like people to fund their accounts then? Other than directly sending tips from one´s bitcoin wallet to someone else´s bitcoin address, I don´t know how this could be achieved without sending bitcoin to your changetip account to fund it. It´s not like you would have to do this every single time you send out a tip, anyway. You only have to top up your account whenever it gets low on funds.

considering that the cost of BUYING a song on itunes is about 1 dollar, I don´t think tipping someone 25 cents is offensive, considering that I do not get to purchase the song, I just show my appreciation for the artist´s efforts. However, if you find a 25 cent tip offensive, I will be sure not to send you any such tips. OP apparently found the tip significant enough to start this thread about it.

I just contributed 0.03407155 BTC (about $20) hope this helps.
By the way I have contributed in bitcoin to other indiegogo campaigns before, where the person running the campaign had announced their bitcoin public address somewhere at the bottom of the campaign description, even though this is not an official payment option on Indiegogo, apparently you are allowed to do this (you may have to ask them first for permission though).
Also besides Localbitcoins you may try mycelium local trader, maybe you get lucky and find a person nearby that wants to trade in your Bitcoins for local currency and you might get a better price than on Localbitcoins that way. Good luck!

This looks like a problem specific to counterwallet which can be avoided by using alternate wallets like freewallet.io where you can set your own fee, choosing from 3 possible levels (low, medium or high) depending on the current level of saturation of the mempool and how urgently you need to get the transaction done quickly. Alternately, you can send an equal amount of BTC as what you already have to that address you want to send your token from, thus avoiding that the wallet uses a bunch of btc dust from previous transactions to construct your new transaction with an excessive number of inputs which would lead to  an excessive TX size and resulting high miners fee necessary to achieve fast confirmation. 
@_date: 2016-01-31 15:23:18
keep in mind that current rewards during the test groups have nothing to do with how much you can expect to make when the storj network goes live. As others have mentioned already, you should be using your spare harddrive space for testing now. We don´t know how long it will take for the final release to come out so investing large sums of money now in hardware is not a good idea if you are not using it for something else already anyway.

in Mexico the fee to send a SPEI bank transfer (almost instant) is around 8 pesos so that is less than 40 cents US. You can withdraw mexican pesos from mexican bitcoin exchanges by SPEI immediately after selling the bitcoin. It´s easy.

which mexican bitcoin exchange does your service use to sell BTC for MXN?
@_date: 2015-08-03 03:24:46
Yes, I´d use bitaddress.org on an offline computer to generate the paperwallet. There are instructional videos on how to do this you can find with a google search. Once you have made and printed this wallet, you transfer whatever amount of BTC you want to that address. The paperwallet will not show the amount contained in the address.

well you can expect the price to keep rising even more in the future, as the total number of GEMZCARDs is only 1000 that will ever exist. You can currently buy GEMZCARD on the tokenly swapbot here at a rate of 2122.25 GEMZ per GEMZCARD: 
Keep in mind that the price of GEMZ tokens has also been rising steadily for several weeks now. Once the public beta of Spells of Genesis is releases, gamers will create an even greater demand for these special blockchain enabled trading cards. Buying in early seems like a good bet at this point, for this and the other limited edition digital SoG trading cards.

I´m in! This gaming platform is already churning out digital trading cards some of which are selling like hotcakes on their swapbots and can already be used in their previous game called moonga.

there is a similar service in Mexico where you can receive cash at ATMs all over Mexico. Your friends or family from other countries transfer bitcoin to this site equivalent to the amount of Mexican Pesos they want to send, and the person in Mexico receives a code by text or email they can use at participating ATMs in Mexico (there are many of those all over) and they don´t need to have any ID, bank account or anything, they just receive the cash. Service fee for sender is 1% and receiving party doesn´t pay any fees.

Hi Matt, I think foldapp looks very promissing but I am wondering exactly how this works so a video would be good to explain step by step the whole process, from charging bitcoin into your app to actually buying the coffee. On the other hand, I have doubts this will work in Mexico where we do have Starbucks but I don´t think they take any of those gift cards or are equipped to scan some code on a cellphone (I assume they need to scan your phone? again, video would help). Maybe some select branches in Mexico City are equipped for this, but who knows?

Storj is a counterparty asset. The Counterparty platform in turn is built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. There is no lining the pockets of the creators going on here. Anyone can participate and contribute to development in the Storj community slack if so inclined. I suggest you do some research first and read the whitepaper before you make inaccurate statements about Storj or any other protocol or service under active development. Storj will open their Beta Test Group B shortly - distributed file storage that can be profitable to those renting out their storage space is soon to be a reality. Learn more at

storj is still in beta. A Dropbox-like interface will be built to make this much more user friendly for the general public. The metadisk web application for renting cloud storage space will present a simple user interface - just drag-and-drop your files to upload. Here is a demo video how Metadisk works:   There is no complicated software to download or account to sign up for. Early beta testers also don´t have to sign up for 3 accounts. All they need is a counterwallet.
 
Regarding your question why bitcoin is not being used directly, I cite from the storj.io FAQ: 
"Transaction fees and strict metadata limits make the Bitcoin blockchain impractical for large scale metadata storage. 
Eventually, we will transition to a system with more direct and scalable access to the Bitcoin blockchain via proof-of-existence.
As blockchain technology improves we can use systems like Factom to provide faster throughput, and Ethereum to create enforceable contracts on data storage."

mercadolibre does in fact exist in Mexico: mercadolibre.com.mx
and it is very similar to ebay at least in concept. Actually it is a very popular site in Mexico, but buyer be ware, cause there are plenty of scammers on this site. If one sticks with sellers with excellent reputation, it´s possible to get some stuff there for fairly reasonable prices, though there are many items offered at inflated prices too, especially if they are the kind that are not easy to get directly in Mexico.

it is possible to offer shares and make an explicit exemption to exclude anyone who goes under US jurisdiction to avoid this problem. It´s not like there aren´t enough investors in other countries that would be interested in participating in this project.
