Hi! I don't have an answer for you... But I have the same question. I have recently started a p2pool server (nr1.co.in) and I have often encountered the problem of bootstrapping the server onto a peers network.
Often, especially for some of the altcoins, when I find that the peer network settings can be improved, or I try to set up an altcoin which is completely new to the p2pool system the problem of bootstrapping comes forward: how do I broadcast the peer info to others?
Maybe this doesn't overlap 100% your question, but I think I'd love a system like the one you propose.

Luckily I was never a BFL/Cointerra customer, and even more luckily I have been a first hour KnC customer, however, aside from that, I really wonder how the shares in the mining landscape will shift once KnC will have its facility up and running.

You mean "Summary"?

Do you think a KnC hashing facility will help rebalancing the mining landscape, at the moment often dominated by constantly growing hashpower of CEX.io/Ghash.io?

I think it's great to see that in spite of the recent bearish market trends there is still people believing in the potential of Bitcoin! :)

Maybe they aren't selling, maybe they're just moving it onto an hardware wallet

I use a 20 characters long password which includes capitals numbers and punctuation. What are the odds it of an hacker deciphering it?

I tried that way already, but it brought nowhere... :(
