I would strongly stay away from Trezor to be honest, they've made some guy loose 250.000$ because of a "unknown bug" 1 month later the guy is still at 0 Bitcoin :)

Thx man ! :-)

Then what
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:06:10
How do you get your funds then ? I'm very curious, I just want to try a first transaction but I'm afraid to loose my money :-)

I wish that happen man but still I want to buy a house so if bitcoin can make me this pleasure, I'll probably sell it all asap
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:48:45
Thanks for your advice. I won't convert it all anyway.
How do you guys make money with BTC ? Just the regular BUY / SELL strategy ?

Bump for more confirmation

I don't question that, my question is more about newcomer.
I mean, to own a 1 bitcoin now is very expensive compared at the 5 years old rate if you know what I mean
I keep seeing topic where people tell newcomers to buy bitcoins. What if it suddently goes down for the next 6 month ? Pretty risky to me
