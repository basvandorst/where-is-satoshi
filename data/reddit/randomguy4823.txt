What actions of the bitcoin community are scarily similar to the world of fiscal dictators, centralized control, and autocracy? This guy's an idiot.
@_date: 2014-01-03 04:41:13
This is the right answer. There needs to be a service for separate address for every transaction. This should be for any POS service.
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:32:42
The Silk Road was the first killer app that got it noticed, but it will also see use in moving money internationally. There is a huge demand to cut the red tape when trying to move money between financial institutions, and *especially* financial institutions that are not in the same country. Not to mention there are many other black markets that popped up after Silk Road. There's no use trying to shut down those sites, and BTC is needed for all of them.

Yes but we can work to mitigate this instinct. Just because it's in our nature doesn't mean we should abandon all attempts at making each other seem more human.

@_date: 2013-11-25 15:36:45
Well, it does require knowledge of cryptography and basic computer science. There are a lot of people who don't know what public-key encryption is, or what a hash is etc. It's really not that simple.
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:27:18
Just a bunch of shills trying to spread FUD so they can get into BTC now before it takes off.
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:22:58


Can you elaborate on this? How will simple checkouts at the grocery store happen? Will the store just have to trust that the transaction was real? What if someone buys more than the minimum trusted amount? They'll have to hold up the line for a whole 5-10 minutes?

It's definitely not legit. Clearly a scam not sure why this is upvoted.
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:56:26
But you are assuming the promises won't be met. They haven't been met yet, but the amount of investment that has been put into making these promises reality in recent months is definitely stoking investor confidence. I believe in the long term promises, but how much higher will the price go without any tangible promises met? It really depends on the amount of risk investors are willing to take on.
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:11:15
Well... yeah, you should assume the layman is an idiot. A ledger is used in accounting, peer-to-peer is a computer networking term (common as cars? come on), and digital signature is a computer cryptography term. These are very specialized industries and definitely not in the realm of knowledge to, say, a car mechanic or high school teacher. gives a great ELI4 version above you. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 15:38:45
So not quite there yet... What does peer-to-peer mean? What is a ledger? What's a digital signature? These aren't exactly layman terms.

Technical analysis is bullshit. You can't predict the future based on the shape of a chart. If bitcoin continues to gain adoption worldwide, then the price will continue to increase. If something happens that sets it back, like an exploit is discovered or governments legislate against it, it will fall.
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:11:08

@_date: 2013-11-29 21:46:35


This is not true. There is wide speculation that the utility will change and for much, much better. The market prices in what people think will happen, adjusted for risk. There has been massive investment in creating companies that want to increase utility since January, so it is logical to assume that there is less risk of having the utility not be much better in the future. Hence, prices rise.

Because of what you are inferring by grouping wives with children. I could be wrong because you didn't really elaborate on why iPhones work better for wives and children, but it sounds like you meant it's simpler and easier to use but lacking in features. For children this is understandable, because their brains aren't fully developed so they could more easily figure out how to use an iPhone. By saying adult women have this same trait because they are married is misogynistic.
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:43:45
You seriously think your mom knows how peer-to-peer works, or how it's different than client-server? You think someone in their 60s knows how BitTorrent works? And if you need to Google something and read the Wikipedia article on it, then it is definitely not ELI5. The whole point of ELI5 is so we don't have to go to Wikipedia.

I think you're both right. On one hand, the banks will lose business because people can manage their own containers. However, many people still like the security of the banking system, with insurance and reversible transactions. I think there will be a market for a Bitcoin backed currency issued by banks in the future for people who don't want the chance of losing all their money irreversibly.
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:09:13
Well there is definitely demand to skirt laws put in place by governments that people think are unjust. Why shouldn't people have access to recreational drugs? Why shouldn't people be allowed to move their money into whatever investments they want anywhere in the world?
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:58:08
Yes, those numbers are confidential. That is the definition of the term until they release those numbers. And if the numbers are less than stellar there's no way they will release them. They need to maintain investor confidence in their business as well as bitcoin in general as that is what drives their business.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:20:59
You should check out or You should not put money into low fee mutual funds. They will rip you off with high management fees. Vanguard ETFs are low-fee index funds, but if you want a good return from one then you have a fairly high risk one. A low-risk ETF would just be holding bonds or other non stock equities. Not the best return on those.

That's perfect! You should edit your first post with this instead of your ELI5.

As Bitcoin matures as a currency, people will develop an address book of sorts. Average transactions won't actually use QR codes. Think of it like a DNS server maps easy to remember URL addresses to the actual IP address of the server. It will be analogous to this.

You would place some Bitcoin in escrow with Uber and it would be transferred as needed to the drivers. Top up if you don't have enough in there. This is how it will have to work with countless other services if Bitcoin is to replace credit cards.

I think I'm smart...

It would definitely hurt BitPay if the numbers were poor. They need to maintain investor confidence in their business.

To be fair it's because Android has gotten a lot better and easier to use a lot faster then iOS has been getting better. Apple really doesn't have the simpleton-oriented advantage that it had a few years prior so now why would average people choose a more locked down system?

The restriction is in moving more than $50K *out of the country*. They can transact their entire fortune from one Chinese bank to another. So now with bitcoin they can buy all the bitcoin they want and then the government can't track how they move it all out of the country.

Yes, but one could argue the same for Facebook which has a &gt; $100 billion market cap. Societal adoption makes the underlying technology orders of magnitude more valuable.
