I make it a habit of not trusting someone who doesn't provide any evidence for their "facts". I am in no way saying you are wrong, but I have also not really seen any major media outlet (crypto-based) saying many of the things you suggest. In fact, if a 51% attack were as cheap as $25,000, it would be happening right now.
I do not hold much BCH and I do hold a significant amount of BTC, but at the same time I use BCH more because its significantly cheaper and much faster transactionally than BTC is right now. Not sure how anyone is getting scammed by them when they almost always certainly call it Bitcoin Cash at the minimum. They may claim that it is in-line with Satoshis original version, but who really cares at this point?
Your argument about China/whoever else owns hashrate is kind of irrelevant as much stats I have seen shown that they also own an almost majority of the BTC  hashrate as well. 
Honestly, the hate between the two is ridiculous at this point. I bet you were banned for being a twat

I feel like ethics has nothing to do with it. Shit tons of things are unethical and there would be plenty of people willing to watch the world burn. Think about it, if its that simple and cheap nation-states or other larger illicit groups would have no issue trying to do this

What makes it a trashcoin outside of your disliking of Roger Ver?
@_date: 2019-06-19 03:16:33
you wont. Mine a different currency, like gold. You're literally more likely to make a return on actual gold at this investment.

What is "rich"? A strong economy definitely helps the middle class citizens that have IRAs and 401ks, 403bs, etc that are investing for their future retirement...smh. It also helps drop the unemployment rate, which is undoubtedly better for society as a whole, even if the average wage isn't growing to where it should be. Blanket statements are dumb. Honestly, weak economies help the wealthy even more as they can buy things at a cheaper price and gain significant sums when the economy improves. 
Look at Rothschilds, Buffett, etc.

I don't think you understand the power of the porn industry then. For a long time they were by far the most bandwidth heavy industry as well as overall Internet usage.
@_date: 2019-01-18 15:16:06
No, I understood your point. And I think that an overwhelming number of people use things in their daily lives they have no idea how work in many different aspect. That doesn't mean its a good thing. I bet 80% of people do not know that they same electromagnetic waves are cooking their food that are sending messages from phone to phone.

This is very true. Our store always had $300. When someone comes in with a $100 we almost always require going in to the safe unless a bunch of customers that day happened to pay with cash
