Hi Daniel,
I did ask many of these questions, you declined to answer them, and I kept asking questions to the point that you literally stopped responding - Did you mis-remember or are you just flat out lying now?
You'll find that I'm a pretty simple guy, just tell the truth and if you can't tell the truth why on earth are you trying to crowdfund to start a company? 
**I don't care if your lawyers say you need to change your name, why does that prevent you from addressing the questions and concerns that you are continuing to avoid?**
At this point your unwillingness to address the issues raised here says Corona is either a would-be scam or you're not the right person to lead the project you're trying to raise money for.  If you want the "crowd" to trust you, be truthworthy.  
From my interactions with you and corona so far that is not a word I would use.  I hope you correct these issues, I hope you're real and not just another opportunistic scammer trying to capitalize on buzzwords but the proof is in the pudding and you've got nothing but a dead website, a conflicted name, some obviously buttered-up communities and a whole bunch of avoidance on things that actually matter.

@_date: 2015-06-01 22:34:52
Your post sort of forces an issue I know I'd been thinking about but not yet devoted the time to sitting down and making a list of all the things that bothered me about it.  
If Corona is real that'd be great but there are too many people trying to take advantage of bitcoin 2.0 buzzwords without actually having any other plan beyond fundraising and spending a bunch of money in whatever they think is best at the time.
I think the biggest issue with the response so far are


Counterparty burned because they literally did not need the funds to fund development.  They funded out of the founders pockets and when they started the burn, the core protocol and software was already done and released.
So Counterparty burned because they wanted to issue the token, that was the important part, and didn't care about raising the money because they had already done the work.
Corona on the other hand is supposedly entirely funding through this mechanism not just their own operation but a grant program for their ecosystem.  How on earth does it make sense to make burning available, when the reason for giving back the token is "adding value to the network" 
How does someone burning add value to the corona network?  Are you concerned about a concentration of tokens in the hands of a few to monopolize asset name creation since .5XCP is needed (5XCP at the time) per asset name claimed?
No... It makes zero sense.
But this next one is of course much worse.


I don't think you understand that the community doesn't make this judgement, the community will eventually be subject to whatever judgement is retroactively made.   The recent ripple case makes it pretty clear that you're selling a security based on a set of criteria about why someone is buying something.  Whether its on paper or a crypto token is not the question.  Here's what i'm talking about






2. an expectation of profits arising from
3. a common enterprise
4. which depends solely on the efforts of a promoter or third party


So.... I'm pretty sure Corona ticks all four boxes of the howey test and is definitely a security under the federal definition.  You used a token to create a security.
The question of where are they legally incorporated basically doesn't matter because US law applies jurisdiction based on the buyers location not the sellers.  If they accept funds from any US customer, they're treated under US laws.

Thanks for the love, any other topics you'd like us to hit that should be getting talked about sooner rather than later?
@_date: 2015-06-02 15:12:18


Daniel, thanks for responding - I don't think you understand the landscape very well.
LTBCOIN is a rewards program, the token is distributed weekly for free to people using the LTB community platform.  We specifically did not sell our token because we had concerns that all token crowdsales would be considered unlicensed securities sales. 
Koinify has recently announced they're going to stop enabling cryptocrowdsales and pivot to something else and when they did do it they were not the ones selling the token, rather it's the specific project or platform.  
Ethereum specifically based their company out of switzerland and literally are working to pass laws to make sure they're not considered anything like a security in their local jurisdiction.  I've heard through the grapevine they are fully expecting to have to deal with a federal investigation in the US at some point because they allowed US buyers. 
Factom I honestly didn't follow so I can't tell you if it is likely to be considered an unlicensed security but the question is, is it a token that is supposed to become more valuable just from holding it, or is it a token that is useful to operate a proprietary network.   The former is a more likely a security and the latter is more likely not.
SWARM is an example of what will almost certainly be considered an unlicensed security - They sold a token that was supposed to increase in value and that might have utility at some point but so far they have not defined that value outside of as a routing vehicle for other tokens that don't seem to have any value.    That looks more like a duck than it does a banana, so it'll probably get grouped with the ducks.
I am not a lawyer, but I'd be curious to know who yours is who has vetted this for you.


I had a similar reaction when I tried to read your whitepaper - I got 6 pages in and then just stopped because it was all buzzwordy nonsense.   You'll remember i asked you what specific pages I should read to understand what you're doing and you told me that I would understand later without actually making any excerpt or page recommendations.   
That to me feels like you put out a white paper because thats an item on the check list of things you gotta do before dumb people are willing to give you money


Can you explain HPOP?   It sounds to me like you think you're the first to set up multiple addresses and accept funding in multiple tokens.  If you are thinking that, you are not - Bitshares did this with Angelshares (which they've now aggressively backtracked because they realized they look a whole lot like an unlicensed security sale) and accepted both Bitcoin and Protoshares - I'm sure many other communities have done that too.


What that means to me is you have a bunch of people who don't actually work for the project now but who put their names and faces up because if you fund and pay them than they will.  
Do you have permission to use all of the people who are on your webpage team?  I heard through the grapevine that Shannon Code had no idea he was up as the primary developer.  


Why would it have the strong potential to attract members to your Network?  Can you explain that specific assumption?
I'm afraid you do not realize that when you value burning money equal to people who give money to further the venture, which is based on money, you are adding people who add no value but their own stake to the pool with people who add value by actually supporting the project.
This means that anyone who burns are diluting what value there is and expanding the token supply literally at the cost of the people who donated and in the bigger picture the chances of the project as a whole succeeding.
I'd say the barrier to someone acquiring your token is the AMOUNT of money you're asking them to no longer have access to.  Whether that's because they burn it or because they give it to you doesn't actually change the quantity of money they need to give up use of.   
How many people do you think...
a. have the money to spend or burn, the ability to do so
b. actually want your token, giving them a reason to do so
and yet
c. would rather burn the money than give it to the project whose token they now hold
I just don't get it.  


Why would I want to buy Coronaz?  What is their utility or value to me that would make me want to lose access to an amount of money commensurate to the number of your tokens i get?


So you need to publicly fundraise before you can even create a company?  That is really not a good thing.


Jurisdiction of rules like the Bitlicense are based on where your customer/user is, not where the company is located.   If you plan on having New York State users, you'll be subject to Bitlicense should it be ineffect.  This is true generally in the united states and it means you're just as vulnerable in the Isle of Man. 
Isle of man might be friendly at a local level but if you are planning on providing service to the US I dont think you're going to get any advantage there.  


What is the much bigger problem?

I don't support what Ross did but the sentencing in this case is unfathomable.  Sentencing should be on the basis of the charges the individual is CONVICTED of, not unproven allegations that are casually mentioned but not charged or tried.
Justice is supposed to be blind, the federal justice system turned Ross from a low level criminal into a martyr of a politicized judge.

Hi Daniel,
I'm glad to hear you want to address the questions brought up by the OP but I don't think it's safe to assume he has an agenda against your project.
Many of the things he's pointed out are things I brought up to you as concerns when you tried to post a partnership announcement through the LTB submission system. At the time you were unwilling or unable to address them. 
Do I also have a motive to attack your project?
You told me you understood that people have concerns because there are so many fundraising scams, we all appreciate you taking the time to address these concerns publicly.

I'd like to hear the answers to these questions.
@_date: 2015-06-02 11:58:00
I've moved entirely to hardware wallets and browser extension wallets (kryptokit for btc and ltb companion for counterparty tokens).
For the first year or so of LTB we recieved a lot of small tips and generated a unique bitcoin address for each episode we posted.  Over time armory bogged down worse and worse until it was difficult to get it to load.
Things might have gotten better, I haven't checked since about .82
So it's not really the size or cost of the full node so much as that wallets that receive a ton of transactions become very bloated and difficult to work with.
I'd love to run a full node but I use all my computers periodicly for very cpu/memory intensive work whether it's VR expreimentation or audio/video pre-processing and running a full node no matter the software has caused instability in my systems when they're under that load. 
I'm planning on running a dedicated full node once plug and play hardware is available.

Here's a question for people smarter than I am that I didn't think about during the episode:
Could Letstalkbitcoin.com let users set up one payment channel with the network that has all the different tip addresses for all the different shows and store addresses built into it.
Basically the question is could you create one payment channel that lets you then spend at all the different merchants at the bazaar and when the channel closes settle up with everyone automatically without needing to centralize the point of payment? Or do you need to have a unique payment channel with each merchant.

I'm not sure you understood the point of the article.  You **do** accept Bitcoin, but instead of a person receiving back a receipt and a promise instead they get back a project specific cryptocurrency that is not valuable if the project fails, but if the project succeeds it will probably be worth more because more people will want it when it's ready compared to when it was a year away from being ready.
In the receipt scenario, you are stuck until the project is completed. 
 In the cryptocurrency scenario you can always sell the project funds, although maybe at a loss.  Because you can sell your position easily, it means that people who don't even want the project reward can support a project by investing in it early then selling its tokens later when the project is closer to delivering.
I know it's a bit of a long article, but I do think there is merit behind this type of approach.  Bitcoin is great for people who have it, but this is even a way for people to support your project with dollars and get Cryptocurrency tokens back that can be traded for Bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-10-11 14:54:28
You might be interested to take a look at Dogeparty vs. Counterparty.  Counterparty has been around since the beginning of the year, Dogeparty since August.  Both charge .5 XCP or XDP to register an asset, but .5XDP cost about 500doge to create when doge was 26 satoshis each and .5XCP cost .0005btc each
So the effective cost (not taking into account current market price which is even more exagerated) is .00013btc for creating an asset on dogeparty vs. .0005btc on counterparty.
Look at the number of assets registered on Dogeparty vs. Counterparty - Dogeparty has more than 4x registered assets even though it's been available for a fraction of the time XCP has.   
This seems to suggest that the price actually might matter quite a bit because while the person registering one asset has no effective difference, the person registering a thousand assets has a nearly 5x higher cost multiplied.  For XDP, it's .13BTC and for XCP it's .50BTC
Certainly not conclusive but higher cost seems to correlate in our small sample with lower early registrations (aka squatting)

I don't think anybody said they performed a function that had never been performed before.    You are assuming to know how they'll be handled, which is something I'm not comfortable doing.  This is an option, it's available, we can use it right now, and it's better than the alternatives because it allows the market to value and distribute the risk.
Not saying it's a solution, just that it's a better way than the other options that are in front of us **and** it's a great opportunity to turn a bad situation into a community experiment that could set a precedent for other such recoveries in non-crypto fields.

I think lost private keys are probably more recoverable.  And they don't have to be lost, they might be in a geographic location where they no longer have control, like an american bank safety deposit box for example.

Goxcoins are only valuable because they represent a claim on 1 bitcoin worth of recovery, ongoing, from the coins missing/lost/stolen from gox.  What happened to them doesn't matter, what does matter is that they can and will be recovered over the next hundred or so years and through goxcoin you can let people trapped inside gox decide to wait for that or trade it away to someone willing to speculate.
No funds go to gox, frankly gox should cease to exist in my personal opinion (not the opinion of humint).
@_date: 2014-02-06 02:34:36
I believe they'll be taking calls but it's live so I'm not exactly clear how things are being organized.
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:03:10
So you know 100% that all the coins from MtGox are gone and not a single  will ever be recovered?   If that is what you believe, than your statement is correct and there is no money.
But I think its much more likely that some % of the coins lost/stolen/missing at gox will be recovered, which means the suitcase is just locked and you can't see inside it rather than being empty.
If you believe the suitcase is empty, it makes sense to sell your goxcoins to someone who does not believe that is true.  If the money is gone, that's a better outcome than you'll get from the conventional system and it gives you the ability to stop thinking about the problem as it will take years to resolve.
Any thoughts?

Coinbase flew out those people and paid for the implementation.  It's a competitive market, they beat out BitPay so it was worth it to them.
Point is, it didn't cost Overstock anything.
Edit: I just re-listened to the interview (still in editing) with the CEO of Overstock, he says Brian from Coinbase called him up and told him they could make it happen much faster and would fly an expert out to handle integration with Coinbase.   They put people in a room, slid pizza under the door metaphorically.  They projected it would take 10 days, it took 8.

If you can't be a shining example, at least be a horrible warning.  Goxcoin will be both, it will remind people that goxcoins will probably never be worth as much as bitcoin because they are a recovery token.  At the same time, they are a first experiment into a new type of recovery that leaves the people most hurt with more and better options than the conventional system presents them with.

I wrote most of it personally, and the coin in its current form (it was originally conceptualized as an equity coin for a new exchange, but that was discarded after we realized how long Gox's assets are going to be tied up in japan) 
I was a customer of Gox back in 2011 or 2012, but I've never worked with them professionally, I've never spoken or emailed with mark or any other employee at gox.   
Michael never talks about any work he did at gox, I assume he is under NDAs

How do you create a tradable cryptotoken without launching a blockchain and having miners?
That seems like a real problem to me.  And it's one people have in the real world, because everybody wants to use this tokenization tech and nobody wants to reinvent the wheel.
You may not "get" why metacoins are a big deal, but you will soon.
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:40:03
haha, I'm working on three other projects with CounterParty (XCP) which could be considered a direct competitor to mastercoin.
But if you're saying I shouldn't propose ideas because I invest in technologies I think will succeed, you must have the same problem with anyone useful talking about bitcoin, litecoin, really any coin that they own.
Please, assume I own *all* cryptocurrencies and take everything I say with a grain of salt.  I make my decisions based on what makes sense in the real world and what I think will work, if you want to believe me you're welcome to do so but if not nobody is forcing you.
@_date: 2014-02-28 05:46:52
yep, but there's no rush so you could do it during a regularly scheduled upgrade like .9
@_date: 2014-08-04 04:10:15
You can trade MSC for BTC (or was it the other way?) the market is bi-directional but still very clunky in counterparty.  You can trade one way with Mastercoin.
So I don't really understand what you mean by walled garden?  Mastercoin has one part of each transaction that goes to the 1exodus address, is that what you mean?
Or do you mean that they have not focused on releasing easy-for-everyone-to-use tools like counterwallet and so you need to go through their org to use the protocol?
Who do you have to trust with MSC, is this the exodus address?
@_date: 2014-04-27 14:42:08
The thesis here is activity is an attractor for additional activity, so lets explore to the metaphor - You're the first to find it.  By walking there you're creating activity, somebody might see you go, over time you wear a more obvious trail leading new people towards it.  You might tell other people about it.
But I don't think the evidence supports "penny hoarders" given a useful service.   I agree the value of a wishing well is minimal at best, but its to illustrate the point that even with environmental value a daily token motivates at least that one person and perhaps others following him to visit it daily which wouldnt happen otherwise if we assume the well has low or zero value.

Interesting proposal, the problem is we don't know the pace of innovation so  I'm not sure how valuable it is to define the "eras" before we've actually lived them and benefit having seen their defining characteristics and events that would normally be used to define those boundaries.

You should try the process of buying XCP for BTC vs. buying XCP for XBTC (an asset redeemable for BTC) - It is very unwieldy and takes about 10x as long as making the same trade for any XCP or above layer asset.
I understand the argument, I just think that in practice you'll see it actually does matter - You need a token that is the "platform" token.

Andreas will have his own show on the Let's Talk Bitcoin! platform.   Right now  we're working on format, might be a legal talk show with a co-host or a rush-limbaugh style bitcoin pundit/call-in show.
All our schedules are nuts and we're upgrading our equiptment so it's been hard to nail down live, I anticipate releasing the first episode of this within two or three weeks.
We're adding 4 new shows next week not including Andreas's, and this is just the start.
@_date: 2014-04-28 12:43:22
Altcoin value built on top of Bitcoin or sidechains or tree chains (like counterparty) add to the usefulness of the Bitcoin network because now I can do something with Bitcoin that I couldn't before.  So altcoins become about specificity of value (one particular smaller ecosystem) while the decision to hold bitcoin is speculation on the entire space (including all the altcoins).  Sorta like how YUM does not compete with USD, arguably the former gives the later something it couldn't acquire lacking the creation and distribution of the new vehicle.

I didn't realize you didn't know Michael was part of Humint, as I mentioned you can see all the members of the group (including him) on the humint.is webpage.  He is on there.  It's not a secret.
I was disputing your suggestion that Mandala owns Humint, which you then implied meant that somehow MtGox had something to do with Humint.  You are wrong on all fronts.  Michael is a member of the Humint group and also an owner of mandala I believe.  He bought the humint DOMAIN because somebody had to.  
Humint itself is not a company yet, so therefore it can't be owned by anybody. Even if it was a company, it would not be owned by Mandala because Michael is just one member of the group, not the owner or leader of it.
Aside from that, we're still figuring out our structure as we have members on six continents and no actual geographic base of operations. 
I know it sucks to lose money, but you're attacking a guy who is trying to make the situation better and that's really unfortunate.
@_date: 2014-08-20 12:15:03
Great idea :) 
@_date: 2014-05-29 19:43:28
It's just a Bitcoin thing :)  I agree with you, Andreas is doing a service and you are attempting to recognize that service.   
There is a bit of a cult of personality in bitcoin around anyone articulate and earnest, but it's only because there's a lack of ideological speakers. The few there are in Bitcoin who put themselves out there and eloquently articulate these ideas tend to earn this sort of fandom from people, notice Andreas is now called "Bitcoin Jesus" as Roger Ver was befor ehim.
I think its a nice piece, but I know he'd rather not have the attention so it might have been better to just share it privately rather than promoting it.

I worked with the craftswoman at  we had a pair of wedding bands cast from part of a gold peso, she did a great job and would have accepted bitcoin if we didnt pay with some of the left over gold.  There was a shipping charge that popped up at the last minute I paid for with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-07 20:55:11
Because colored coins requires specific satoshis or groups of satoshis to be marked, where Counterparty just uses the satoshis as essentially a change-order for the Counterparty global ledger.
Colored Coins can do stuff with Bitcoin but they can't control bitcoin, because Colored Coins are a protocol layer above Bitcoin.  When you do a decentralized exchange transaction on Counterparty, if you're using XCP or any user created asset, everything is automated because the protocol can control both assets and make the change to the Counterparty ledger at the same time.
With Bitcoin that can't happen because the Bitcoin ledger needs to be changed to reflect the Bitcoin side of the trade, and the Counterparty ledger needs to be changed to reflect the counterparty side of the trade.  Because these things happen in different systems it means one can happen but the other does not for whatever reason.
Using XBTC (a Counterparty Asset redeemable through an automated or trusted source for BTC) you can have all the advantages of automatic fulfillment without risk the other side cancels the TX but your side goes through.
Nothing wrong with the colored coins approach but Counterparty is different and in my opinion a superior option.

The DB leak is a last resort because its almost certainly been amended with false claims.   The distribution of Goxcoins is extremely important, so at this point I believe the various plaintiff lawsuits and private recovery efforts will get their members claims certified and then the tokens will be created and given to individual groups when they submit their certified claims.
Otherwise if we get three months down the road and find out there was an extra 100,000 fake claims in the mix, the issuance will have a major problem.

I think it's really scary giving up control.  With a national money the worst that can happen is everybody suffers, but with a game people are there voluntarily so if things get bad enough they'll just leave.

The trolls are justified, but that doesn't change the fact that Gox is just way out of their league and yet a giant media magnet highlighting that fact and making them subject to ever more both attacks and customers, neither of which they can really handle.
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:43:02
The best part about this suggestion is we don't need to know what happened, all we need to do is figure out who is effected.
If you wanted to start an exchange based on a token like this, you would need to wait for gox to explain, if you want to buy their assets, you need to wait for gox to explain, but for a token that represents a claim on 1 bitcoin in the mtgox recovery it does not matter how gox lost the money or how much they lost, only that it is missing and people fear the worst.
This has nothing to do with the ongoing criminal investigation, it is a rescue for the people who have coins trapped in gox.   
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:19:52


Its value is determined by the market, based on people speculating on future recoverys of the coins last/missing/stolen at gox.  That will probably take years to unwind, but the info is all there on the blockchain.  Coins in the wrong hands can and will be recovered if bitcoin is successful and the value continues to bloom.
@_date: 2014-01-08 16:02:20
Looking forward to this event, got a great talk planned :) 
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:06:22
All of this assumes gox continues as an exchange people actually use and care about, and I do not believe that should be true.  Gox should die, there should be a recovery effort for the missing/lost/stolen funds.  
Any solution that relies on gox trading claims that can never leave their exchange is a bailout of gox, goxcoin is an independent cryptotoken outside of gox's control.
@_date: 2014-06-16 18:04:32

Yeah, here's the statement from your blog post:
"Representatives from Mandalah declined to elaborate on any specifics regarding its relationship with Mt.

Gox to do “strategic planning” and say they lacked access to sensitive financial information or customer data.**  "

Yep!  Proof-of-Burn when the recovery effort closes up and the last dividend is paid.
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:48:44
I don't believe Mtgox will "make back the 850k btc"  Do you?
I believe there will be a long recovery process where people who took out too many BTC are tracked down and sued, keys to old wallets are found and backups bring some long-locked away funds out of cold storage.
This is not an 'and everything goes back to normal' situation, it is a recovery after a company failed and lost customer funds through whatever means.   As such, there is a dollar-for-dollar claim process.  That will happen no matter what.
What this solution proposes is to peg those bitcoin claims to the recovery of lost/stolen/missing bitcoin over whatever length of time, and then give the market an incentive to recover the missing funds.
"metacoins" have value because they allow for the creation of local cryptotokens, Goxcoin is the local token for the global gox recovery effort.  
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:25:14
Goxcoin wouldnt be traded on gox, at least not exclusively.   The whole point of making this a real coin is that any exchange could implement the pair, and actually since it's built on Mastercoin it'll be tradable against ANY mastercoin user created asset on the DECENTRALIZED exchange that is built into mastercoin.
The whole point of this is to avoid lockin.  bitcoinbuilder was a good start, but if it goes down or is hacked all those claims on gox bitcoin go poof.   
Making it a full fledged token is the only way to prevent a "you can only trade goxcoin locked inside the gox exchange because we can't give you the money" result that is likely to happen, if they don't just convert it all to yen values first.
@_date: 2014-06-14 13:45:10
Hey you don't have to argue with me about that, we made a big deal about this on LTB back in August of last year and we got many many complaints that we were too focused on asic and pool centralization.
This is why tree-chains is so exciting to me potentially, where sidechains does not do anything to help the mining situation and actually further compounds their power, tree chains would bring back solo mining since it lets you go as far down the difficulty tree as you want.   
Solo mining being a dumb choice in the current ecosystem is the root of this problem, pools are just a symptom.
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:13:34
Gox is out a large amount of missing/lost/stolen bitcoins, those bitcoins don't cease to be the lawful property of those they were taken from just because gox goes under
As i Mentioned, there will be a recovery process.  It could take 100 years.  But if it's hundreds of thousands of bitcoin, in a hundred years there are MORE reasons to recover the coins than even now.
The blockchain sees everything

From the user perspective, you'll use a new "multiwallet" that will have bitcoin, mastercoin and any user created asset (like goxcoin) you want to hold that is built on mastercoin.
Mastercoin isn't perfect, but it's ready now, they want to support the idea and are willing to work hard to do it.  Now is when we need a solution, so I'm very happy to partner with them.

I shot you a note but we never set up a time, what's your beef?

Right, but we're very very early in this process.  You asked me to estimate, I'm giving you the closest thing we have to real data.

@_date: 2014-03-04 19:15:39
We actually don't.  This works just as well with plaintiffs in a private recovery effort/lawsuit tokenizing the rights to whatever they recover.
It is "better" if gox does this, because it would be definitive.  I don't think that will happen though because of the bankruptcy proceedings.
Other people wanted to push hard for a plan that needed Mark's or Gox's cooperation, but I just want to tokenize the recovery effort.   Doesn't require anything from gox outside of them being screwed, which they've got covered.
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:34:40
goxcoins are better than nocoins
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:38:04
The problem is, that relys on MtGox becoming a good company and frankly I think that corporate entity should die in a fire.  They were never suited for the level of the game they're playing at, and keeping them around as a legacy just dilutes the horrible warning they should stand as in history.
If a company forms, they can choose to honor these claims.  If not, this is a good interim solution until we figure out what the long long term plan is.
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:36:26
It's not about how I would handle it, it's about how gox will handle it.  This process will go most trusted and verified to least in all likelihood.

Thanks for sticking with the conversation, this document leaked to reddit before it was ready and the language about needing gox was much debated because we WANT them to do it themselves, but we don't need them.  The site made it seem like we did because we didnt want to offend gox

Andreas is trying to help but the problem with working like a maniac in this space is it looks like you're showing up everywhere, which some people interpret to mean you want the limelight for yourself.  That's not the case with Andreas or really any of us.  
Don't take this as chastisement, I actually think the piece is quite nice.  I'm sure he'll be flattered and humbled by your sentiment.

MtGox will not be a corporate entity, there will be a recovery effort that is done outside of gox to forensically pick through the remains, track down stolen or lost coins and funnel them to stakeholders.
There will only ever be as many goxcoins as there are verified, attributed bitcoins stuck in gox held by real people.  So yes, it actually should be a very rare crypto relatively speaking.
And you don't have to do this, some debtors will prefer to have their debt tokenized rather than be stuck with gox owing them an amount of yen they'll discount the total from.

The problem with this, is then you need to start an exchange and it needs to be successful.    That means you need to a) trap the "shares" as bitcoinbuilder-esque tokens that cannot be withdrawn because there is no value there to pay for them until the company has profited enough to make that happen.   It means B) you need to find investors who are willing to pony up a bunch of money but have their investment diluted both by the original shareholders, the new customer-shareholders, the new investors and the operation of the venture.
Goxcoin is not trapped on gox's platform, it's a real cryptotoken you can send and receive without using anything besides a wallet, and irrespective if gox is a successful business or not.
It's not about "gox" it's about recovering the coins that were lost/missing/stolen because they represent a huge amount of value and if reckoned into yen and  paid back over a number of years, that value is lost to the people who should have it.
If the token is tied to recovery, the value follows the correct deflationary trend because you're actually recovering a deflationary asset.

The tl;dr is adding a second key that must be shared by the pool to the individual miners that gives the individual miners the ability to steal the funds if they are un-trustworthy.
This means the larger your pool, the harder to control the risk of someone giving into the temptation and taking the funds, and so it won't make sense to have large pools, it will make sense to have small pools, which are fine.  
We also discuss selfish mining (the interviewees are the authors of that paper from last year) and their proposed fix for that.
Obviously that is very simplified

We have a major exchange partner onboard ready to trade goxcoin/bitcoin, they do not currently trade altcoins so this would be a major listing.  They also have been talking about donating 50% of the trade fees on that pair to the holders of Goxcoin as a monthly dividend.

No, they don't.  Gox isn't going to work with us so we're working with the largest plaintiff group.  They're going to get their claims and plaintiffs verified by the japanese legal system, and those verified claims will be "Proof of Goxxed" which will cause humint to administer the creation of the amount of verified coins, which will be given back to the plaintiff group and distributed among their members accordingly.  
Then the plaintiff group does recovery or sues or whatever and their rules will be that they distribute as dividends to the goxcoins.
More than one plaintiff group can do this, individuals can also do this without a plaintiff group but it would be better if people pooled their resources.
the whole process will be transparent, and we have a large non-altcoin exchange that has agreed to list Goxcoin:Bitcoin after the first proof of goxxed.
So it's only an internal mechanic within the plaintiff groups, there is NO reduction in liability from gox.  Am I right?

Because Humint is a project that has been underway since December designing cryptocurrencies to replace reward point programs and to bootstrap new community ecosystems.  We proposed Goxcoin because it's a better idea than the other ones that were floating around at the time, and it's an area where I've been spending a lot of time thinking so was able to make the connection before most other people.
I wasn't involved with Gox at all, you're acting like I'm some giant mystery but I do a twice weekly SHOW on which we've been talking about how dumb it is to keep money in gox.  Literally a year ago we were talking about this, and we talked about it again many times since then.
Here's the thing - Humint also isn't under a microscope, I just don't like leaving people stupid even if it's their own fault.  The Goxcoin project is progressing because the people who are actually affected see the value in it, and if they don't they won't use the solution we've offered.  
It's opt-in just like everything else in Bitcoin.  The only thing that isn't opt-in is finding your bitcoin trapped at gox.
This is as much time as I can devote to helping you understand, good luck.

because XCP will be in demand by more people, it has several uses in the counterparty ecosystem
1 - You need to pay 5XCP to create an asset
2 - Dividends and Callable Assets are denominated and paid in XCP
So if *any* number of projects use XCP as their ecosystem, XCP will have uses beyond what it already does.   Basically whatever happens on the platform happens in XCP so the more features a platform offers the more uses and therefore the more valuable the platforms token should be.

Actually Counterparty does not use colored coins, it uses little bitcoin transactions to send messages which modify a second distributed ledger.
**So if I want to send 100 LTBCOIN or 1 LTBCOIN or 100,000 LTBCOIN I'm only ever sending the same minimum transaction (right now its .000112btc) because it's not actually the satoshis that are the LTBCOIN, rather the satoshis are the stamp on the send order for whatever amount I want.**

It'll be extracted via the legal process, and not by humint or mastercoin but by plaintiffs who join together in group recoverys or class action lawsuits.
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:21:50


It's actually not 1:1 for all coins lost.  It is 1:1 for all coins verified lost by verified customers.  The gox balancesheet is a mess, thats how they lost all the coins.  
Probably this will go through a private recovery effort, where people legally agree to pool their recovery rights in exchange for these tokens that represent 1btc each worth of recovery potential over say, a hundred years.   
You could even see competing recovery efforts issuing their own version based on the plaintiffs and their amounts in their recovery effort.

No more BTC can be destroyed, the period of initial CHA generation is over.   It means that the amount should go down over time but the rate or amount depend on how many bets are made.  The more bets, the more deflationary that 1% will be.
And CHA just like BTC is divisible to 8 decimal places, so even a large market could be sustained from just one very valuable CHA
@_date: 2014-05-18 00:55:36
Yes, it seems to reduce the total supply of tokens (CHA) when a gambler loses, so every loss is a permanent reduction but minor adjustment in the total money supply.
Thinking about it, unless the house wins more than the players this will be inflationary rather than deflationary.  The house has a 1% edge which should predispose it to a slight deflationary trend I guess, I dunno what I think about this system.

Hey guys,
Humint.is is a group of individuals including myself, Michael just bought the domain.  We're not even incorporated yet, but Wendell Davis ( is the guy leading the operation.
Michael's company is Mandala, he consulted with Gox on strategic and branding issues, not financial or trading or anything in those worlds.   
The Goxcoin initiative is designed to give people with funds trapped in gox a better way than having their bitcoins valued at an arbitrarily low value, locked at that value, and then only be eligible to recieve a percentage recovery based on that amount over a number of years.
If instead we "tokenize" the claim, it gives us all the advantages of BitcoinBuilder without the concern that if BitcoinBuilder goes down all the claims are gone since they weren't a real cryptocurrency.
Once in token form, they act as a ticket to any funds recovered over however long that takes.  Mastercoin allows dividends to be paid to the holders of these coins, so whoever has them, wherever they trade if you are holding the coin when a recovery happens from MTGox you will get a % of it relative to your total holdings.
But once this is in place there are possibilities beyond that, there are many new coins coming out all the time and increasingly they are looking for ways to distribute themselves to a large body of people who might be interested in joining their community/currency/movement.  Donate 1% of your premine to Goxcoin holders and what is a charitable act also vests all those people with your project.   Donating to Goxcoin holders becomes an advantageous marketing move.
There are more reasons why this is a good idea, I'd be happy to have the debate as this particular approach was my idea and I believe it's the most advantageous one yet proposed.
It can also be successfully done with or without the cooperation of Mt.Gox, which makes it distinctly advantageous given the current environment.
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:14:06
who does it enrich, and since this only represents verified claims where is the dilution?
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:03:09
I argued for this at first, but then it becomes just a trinket which was thought to be less well recieved than a coin representing a claim.
The point isn't to make gox solvent, nobody can do that.  But we can make the claims tradable, and we can let non-gox companies interact with people impacted by the gox issue.  They'll do nice things because they want the goxcoin users business.

Hey, I'm the primary at LTB and I OK'd this post.  Ben Doernberg is not part of LTB, he is an individual who asked to use the LTB platform to publish his questions.   You can take a look at the front page of LTB, and outside of anything that actually says Let's Talk Bitcoin! in the title of the post it's all writer-initiated and then LTB editorial gets involved as neccesary but we work from a presentation viewpoint rather than a content curation viewpoint.     
Ben was recently a guest on the let's talk bitcoin show (again, not part of LTB but a guest using the platform) talking about Moolah.  LTB did not investigate, Ben did and shared his findings and experiance with LTB.  Do you see the distinction? 
I suggested to Ben that he go to Jason directly with these questions and then publish both pieces at once.  He explicitly and expressly told me he did not want anyone to know about the piece before it was released because he felt it might allow the questions to go unanswered or be deflected.  I emailed Jason literally as soon as the post had gone live to let him respond as quickly as possible without stepping outside what I perceive my responsibility to a writer using the LTB platform.
Since Jason has solicited and collected money from the community for an explicit purpose that is not to benefit him, there is more scrutiny than if he were just "some guy". It would be different if people gave Jason money with the assumption it's going to be used by him personally for whatever he wants.  If you ask for public money, there is an expectation of public transparency - That's sorta the deal.
While the questions are not neccesarily fun to answer, I found Jasons response to be informative and helpful.  It also makes sense why he hasn't been tremendously open about his past, it's embarrassing.
I consider Jason to be a friend having spent some time with him both online and offline, in all my experiances he's been a great, thoughtful and compassionate guy who obviously cares an unreasonable amount about the shitty situation people who find themselves homeless are in.  I have no doubt in my mind this is an incredibly important issue for Jason, and I hope that the publication of this hasn't impacted that but ultimately that's the job.
I hope you read the article, it is indeed just a bunch of questions written and prepared by Ben followed by the first response from Jason - 
No accusations, no investigation, no "we here at LTB..." just questions and answers. 
Could it have been less dramatic?  Yes, that's why I pushed to ask the questions first privately and then publish the results but ultimately I chose to respect the desires of the writer using the platform.  That's the point of the platform.
@_date: 2015-05-08 17:20:36
Seems like you might want the block size to be more reactive than that, patterning after the difficulty adjustment makes the most sense to me.

@_date: 2014-04-07 22:22:59
I'm of the opinion that new tokens should be created because they act as bootstrapping mechanisms to build early community critical mass fast.  Lacking that you get the muted response of colored coins.   Altcoins leverage this same phenomenon but generally they have no good reason backing it up so once the community is bootstrapped theres this big "Well what do we do now?" moment where all the easy funds are being absorbed and the community has to transition off of the stimulus and into a sustainable reality.  
Most simply do not have a sustainable reality beyond the suspension of disbelief that the coin has no future, and no selling because you don't want to recognize a loss.
I don't really care about the underlying machinations or technicals, I like that it works and it's user friendly(er) and there's all the possibility in the world.  
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:44:55


This is not correct.  Gox is insolvent but that doesn't mean it's all gone, it just means there will be a recovery and investigation process. 
Bitcoinbuilder is gox in another form, the coins there are not transferable because they're not a real token just a database entry.  If they are hacked or go down, the tokens go with them.  
This solution takes bitcoinbuilder and makes it so you can trade them on any exchange.
@_date: 2014-03-05 04:06:59
See that's where you're wrong.  You're going to learn that the people who you think had privileged information are actually the ones who lost the most of anyone.    
I'm doing an interview with a guy who lost several million dollars worth of BTC on gox and who mark K personally assured that he would have access to it.    I've been approached by at least five other people who lost more than six figures, many of whom had personal relationships with Mark over many years, and all of whom got totally screwed by this.

Whatever the number winds up being, they didn't just vanish into thin air.  Some day this whole thing is going to be ripped open and the guts of it picked through to find who did what wrong, and when that happens lots of those bitcoins will be recovered.
Any time that money gets spent, it'll set off alarm bells and the recovery will start investigating, tracking it back, finding out who spent it and where they got it form.
I'm **not** saying this is a good outcome, I am just sharing what I think a **likely** outcome of this is.  It's too much value to just be left lost, as bitcoin grows in value that issue will compound.
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:50:10
I don't want to give people false hope, but once you have the people who lost coins in gox or the people who bought those tokens from the people who lost coins in gox identified, there is all manner of things that can be done to help that group.  Think about it.
Regarding "sold to users who lost 500 million" here's the thing, they lost that no matter what.  This is a terrible situation, and they only have bad options.      This option is the least bad and makes the best lemonade given the lemons available.

I think his point (and others who I have spoken to whose opinions I respect quite a bit) is that Ripples consensus mechanism is such that even theoretically their "mining' equivalent does not act as a disconnected check against the unchecked power of the Ripple company.  In bitcoin at least the people running the mining pools are not also the company paying the core developers and so there is clear seperation of power.  With Ripple, that seperate does not exist and so it might as well be a centralized system because the developing company truly is the giant central point of failure whose removal from the ecosystem would basically cause the ecosystem to fail.
My argument was and has been that, technically, ripple is a decentralized protocol but thats based on a somewhat limited understanding of their consensus mechanism, I didnt realize they had essentially hardcoded the validating nodes to majorly ones they control.   I didn't realize they were doing bulk sales of the underlying token through a subsidiary company to investors while on the other hand saying the token is an anti-spam mechanism
All of those things mean that yeah, basically ripple and XRP are centralized - they just created a centralized system that looks decentralized unless you understand it intimately and know who is filling the various roles.

It means other exchanges will up their game, and MTGox will be less relevant than ever.  So yes, it is good news for the medium-long term future of functional exchanges.

I'm a known figure in the bitcoin space, you should assume I am invested in everything.   
You're posting about Bitcoin when you hold some Bitcoin.  I don't fault you for that and I don't blame you for that, I think that makes sense.   What I don't think makes sense is to view your investment in bitcoin as the thing that prevents any coin you're not invested in from being worth understanding.   
There is a legitimate problem being solved here, it's easier and cleaner to enact it without a blockchain or mining, so a metacoin is the ideal solution and Mastercoin is available now.  Why are you so angry?

I've been contacted by a listener who works at google, and who has escalated and is going to babysit the issue.  He told me he'd update me on Tuesday, so we have an advocate on the inside which is what I was hoping for.

We'd be happy to publish an article you submit explaining why XT is bad, we're going to be publishing perspectives from both sides.  You'll have to provide actual arguments rather than just attacking the opposition but if you actually want to try and convince people to come around to your way of thinking, LTB is a neutral platform.  You can email me adam or just use the submission system built into LTB

Spells of Genesis has been heavily marketed and made good use of partnerships (all the themed cards) but I don't think it's scammy, I think they're striking while the iron is hot and doing a good job promoting the project.
I've been pretty surprised by the prices they've been able to pull out of people but I can tell you that most people are buying them because they think they're going to be worth a lot more later since this is literally the first token control access collectible game ever.  
Also the game hasn't been built yet, that was the point of the fundraiser they're doing now.  The one you were looking at is either their old game from 2009 (which the tokens will also work in supposedly) or their prototype which Is indeed not that impressive but it's a prototype.
If it's a scam, they've got me hoodwinked too :)  I have high hopes for this one.
Full disclosure: My company rents Spells of Genesis a bunch of vending machines and we let them pay us in cards because it's cool.

I worked with Jeremy Lam from Vennd to create auction vending machines for LTB last summer, we went back and forth for months and eventually I wound up hiring Devon Weller to build our first auction vending machine system which worked but had flaws
About half a year later we started Tokenly and since Vennd still hadn't solved our problem (they stopped offering services last year as far as I can tell) we wound up building Swapbot Vending Machines as one of our first projects (because it was so important for everything else)
If Vennd had been around and solved our problem we would have used their vending machines and skipped straight to the app I REALLY wanted which we call "Tokentime" and is basically calendar booking with tokens, dollars and btc
Everything we're building, we're building because we need it to get to the next step and nobody else did it in a way that solved our problem without us having to build it yet.

If anybody would like to represent the against-XT position, it would be appreciated - Why is this bad?
@_date: 2015-08-20 14:32:34


This is exactly the reason why I worked on and supported the launch of Dogeparty last year.  Turns out the attempt was a) early for the need and b) understaffed for implementation and maintenance but this thought that drove us to get it out there was exactly this.
Right now with the Tokenly project we basically don't support sales cheaper than 30 cents because anything below that has more than 10% going to miner fees, which we perceive to be the upper limit of acceptable cost.

LTBCOIN is a token using Counterparty on bitcoin, not an altcoin since it uses bitcoin miners and transactions for every single LTBCOIN transaction.  Tokens provide real, fee paying utility to bitcoin and make it more than payments.

It's an open source vending machine project that allows users to swap bitcoin and counterparty tokens programmatically based on individual users desired outcomes. 
So, he's talking about Bitcoin.

Just so you know, you only need to verify an address if you want to use Token Controlled Access - If you want to spend or redeem, you can use swapbots 
There are currently 18 different swaps that accept LTBCOIN on tokenrank.

He consulted for Neo and Bee, which is really different than promoting them.   He basically stopped doing publicizable consulting (i.e. the client can say that you consulted) because of that and other experiences.   
When you're just a dude and suddenly you're THE Andreas Antonopoulos and people suddenly care a whole lot about your opinions it takes a while to get used to that power. Having that sort of impact means that you never want to actually use it because then everybody says you're abusing it, so if you think about it Andreas isn't even really allowed to have an opinion publicly any more because people will hold him to it.
I'm incredibly grateful to Andreas for filling the public facing role he does, it's one i've always taken steps to avoid and somebody needs to do it right

I've wondered a lot about this recently, I'm not convinced you were wrong, it might have been better to do all development within LTB and focus solely on those needs, but then as now I'm not sure our experiment with LTB will "work" and so the priority stopped being just about LTB.
If we had chosen to focus on LTB, instead of spending the money on developing technology we would have spent it on some paid staff instead of pure volunteers.  Would that have been a better decision?  I don't know.  
LTB was the reason and the catalyst for all the things we've built with tokenly, but we built them not just for LTB so that whether LTB succeeds or fails in its own set of experiments (which it always has been to me, although that's not true for everybody) the work that we're doing can continue and be applicable for others who want to try some variation.
Then as now my contention is that the project has its own pace and people should leave or join based on what they need in their lives at the time.   As the platform grows and changes over time you might find that it is again the best place for you to do your work and rejoin while at the same time others will find it has become something that isn't as valuable to them as it once was.  
It's just the way things are, and I'm comfortable with it.
Incidentally, good to see your words :) It's been an age.

LTBCOIN was the first ever crypto community rewards program and at the time as now saying things like "equity" is inviting trouble.  Creating something that acts like equity is inviting trouble.  
So we didn't launch something that looked like Equity, we launched something that looked a lot like Bitcoin - People didn't buy new tokens, they earned them through a competitive process where everyone including the creators were on equal footing. Not a single person bought LTBCOIN, it's all been distributed according to our published plan (linked in an earlier reply)
Lots of people have been less conservative than we have, I've got no problem with that I just like my life and don't want to find myself on the wrong end of a retroactive cryptoequity ruling years down the road.

It's a soundcloud embed, you de-listed an 80 minute exclusive interview.
@_date: 2015-09-07 15:19:32
Really lol?  The one thing you couldn't abide was a rewards program built on bitcoin given out for free?
@_date: 2015-09-07 15:35:17
Depends what you mean by Paid Off
If by that you mean that it's an ongoing experiment that we're developing solutions to fit the needs of, then it's definitely paid off.  
We had more problems and ran into more unexpected difficulties as a result of launching LTBCOIN as the earliest crypto-rewards program which led to the creation of a whole suite of open source tools that solve the problem not just for LTB but for anybody who wants to do something with a token built on bitcoin.
If you're asking if I got rich off the wild success of LTBCOIN price, that'd be a no, but that was never the expectation.  I am the largest holder of LTBCOIN unsuprisingly because I create more content for the network than just about anybody else and for much of the early period my content was more popular than everybody elses.  You can take a look at all the stats here on this page, you'll find the rewards program leaderboards at the very bottom of the page.

I just want to be clear that although Andreas Antonopoulos is involved in the Let's Talk Bitcoin show, he isn't really involved in any of my experimentation with tokens, LTBCOIN, the LTB network, Tokenly, etc.   
So feel what you want about the projects but understand that the one responsible for the direction and drive on all of this is me and any contradiction you might see between what I'm doing with these projects and what you think Andreas believes have nothing to do with each other.
@_date: 2015-09-07 15:21:37
just for the record, there was no IPO or sale at all of LTBCOIN - All LTBCOIN has been distributed for no monetary cost to content creators and audience members.  You can see the weekly distribution map here
@_date: 2015-09-07 15:09:41
Just to correct here, Andreas is a host of the LTB show but I don't really think he can be accurately described as "promoting LTB" or especially "LTBCOIN"
Andreas just like everybody else who creates content at LTB is an autonomous individual, we don't even have a contract with him and we don't pay him (although he does earn some LTBCOIN rewards when he accepts the collaborator invitation).
@_date: 2015-09-07 14:52:48
Still are distributing, although we've now left the "easy ltbcoin" stage.
you can see the weekly distribution schedule and allocations here.

Just as an FYI, LTBCOIN is actually a token embedded within the bitcoin blockchain, so every single transaction made using LTBCOIN is actually both a bitcoin transaction and an LTBCOIN transaction.
As to why we can't just use bitcoin, here's an example we developed last summer called Token Controlled Viewpoint, which to summarize allows a website, app or service to use the contents of your bitcoin address as your access token inventory.  When you possess a given token that corresponds to a rule, power or permission within the app, website or service then the system gives the associated user whatever should be granted according to their tokens. 
You can't do that with just bitcoin because you can only have different amounts of the bitcoin token.  Using counterparty, you can have literally thousands or millions of different assets each in unique amounts associated with a single bitcoin address.  Those tokens can control different rules at different websites and services, those tokens cannot be reposessed or removed by the platform you're using them on, they are owned by the user the same as bitcoins are.
This is incredibly powerful and not possible using bitcoin without something like counterparty built on top of it.
@_date: 2015-09-07 15:13:53
Given that all LTBCOIN is given away...  I'd love to hear what part of it struck you as a tier'd sales pyramid?
@_date: 2015-09-07 16:02:41
You can find other ways to use/acquire LTBCOIN at our Swapbot Vending Machine search engine, tokens like LTBCOIN don't make a ton of sense in exchanges because they aren't applicable to most of the people using the exchange, so we've created a service that lets anybody run an automated token vending machine and sell/accept whatever tokens they want.

Sooner now than ever before :)

Just so you know, you definitely don't need to use [Tokenly Pockets]( to control your LTBCOIN.  Tokenly Pockets is just more convenient because we've implemented an expanded token payment protocol so that when you click the 'pay' link it loads your wallet in a new browser window (locally on your computer, not served remote) that is preloaded with the payment token, the payment amount, the payment memo and the payment recipient.  
You double check the info and click the "send" button and are presented with a link to see the tx confirm on the blockchain.
So the reason you'd use Tokenly Pockets is because its more convenient in a lot of ways and we're actively developing it (Joe just added label exports, an expanded token information protocol (you can try it at  and in the next day or so an in-wallet tutorial overlay will be in.
Tokenly Pockets isn't intended to replace counterwallet at least yet, it's more intended for users rather than powerusers who will find counterwallet more versatile (DEX access and asset creation).
We built Tokenly Pockets explicitly because Counterwallet was unstable, not being actively developed and not reliable for making transactions under many network circumstances.  
And if you want to take a look at the source,

I love that multi-sig can be used for two factor auth (wallet on your phone, wallet on your computer) or to do shared wallets between multiple people.  It really is the best security i've seen.   If you want to get crazy use a trezor for your key storage, which Copay also supports (through their web deployed version)

There are a lot of caching layers being built in various verticals to alleviate onchain congestion.

They were "going through channels" and going to get back to us, my expectation is they're in no rush so long as we don't do something crazy like sell bitcoin for dollars. 
It's a bit like a janitor looking at a mop whose handle is one giant cutting surface.  Sure, he's used mops before and could even be considered an expert.  And in that expert opinion, that's a mop no sane person would want to touch.   I suspect this is the case with Bitcoin companies, sure it's money but it's strange and scary money that could compete with their much more established money laundering services.

Yeah, I have no doubt they would have just dropped us if we didn't have a bunch of accounts with them in non-bitcoin related areas.

My company is going through the same thing with Chase right now, but they are not so willing to throw us out the door because we'll be taking a fair amount of money from their investments if we do.
They brought in our CFO four days ago and basically said they wanted to keep our business but we just needed to stop recieving money from Coinbase.  
 Not that there was anything wrong with it, just that it needed to stop.  Immediately.  Forever.  Or they would have to end our rather long relationship.   
It did not seem like they were happy about it, more like there was no choice.
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:41:57
As soon as our CFO got out of the meeting, he went across the street to RaboBank and told them the story, then spent the rest of the day speaking to other banks.  
We're done with Chase, it's just a question of how hard it is to find a new home.  We don't want to move and then have the same problem a few months later, charge sponsors a 30% surcharge if they pay in USD, so everybody pays us in BTC thus Coinbase is very helpful for things like paying taxes that we still need USD for
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:01:10
Except Let's Talk Bitcoin! is a media company that invoices advertisers and recieves donations from listeners.   We just hold them in Bitcoins and sell when the price is advantageous, buy when the price is advantegous through our corporate account.
Bottom line, we told Chase months in advance exactly what we were going to do, we did exactly what we said we were going to do, we followed all the rules and went above and beyond, and they still don't want to have anything to do with Coinbase. 
Its not us keep in mind, it's just Coinbase.
