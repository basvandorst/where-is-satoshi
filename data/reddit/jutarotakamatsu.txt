Well there's definitely no need to Id verify which is a bonus but I find the fees are ridiculous.

You're definitely right... basically .. is it worth to pay the extra for the anonymity ... or do you just not care... ID verify and get only 1% fees... or use an ATM or mybtc... same as an ATM IMO and get fewer btcs...I'm gonna buy 4K worth of BTCs and at that price... the difference is about .03 of a btc

I know it's high by almost every standard but it is also very easy. Mybtc you don't have to ID verify.. where counsquare you do... and how long does that take? I'm not saying that's not a better option it may be...it usually takes a few days to be verified here. I'm not in that much of a hurry but I just want to make sure the price is right . Buy that dip!

I don't mind supporting the local guys .. but there's some understandable gouging going on... they have a business to run and are so small they can't afford 1%

That's not a bad idea the only problem is sending wire money over seas. I suppose it's not really a problem but if you have ever heard of wiring problems to kraken and the sort... they seem to pop up more and more here.
