Will the average demand for bitcoin ever stabilize?

Well, what do you think of the results?  A few mixed opinions, but the highest comment says it'll stabilize in six years.

BTC is still infinitely more digital, technically.

My best guess is that bitcoin has suffered irreparably from tragedy of the commons.  The recent astronomical increase in bitcoin's value shows that it is just too volatile to be used as a viable alternative to fiat currency.
As a result, I expect bitcoin to suffer a severe decrease in price when those buying/selling purely to make a profit decide to leave the market, after which it will stabilize at a low value, and be used mainly by people who are interested in sending anonymous small payments online.
I'm guessing that this process will happen relatively quickly, in the span of 3-5 years.

To be fair, his answer was more about a timeframe in which something would occur, rather than the specific event.  So it's not super insightful, but it's not entirely vague either.
