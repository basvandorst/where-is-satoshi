This article has several factual inaccuracies. For instance, Derek Minter is not a founder (or employee, though he is a friend) at Clef.

Decentralization is a spectrum and we definitely understood the tradeoffs we were making by keeping pieces of Clef central -- we ended up prioritizing the user experience, which required more management on our part. I definitely think an ideal system would have both, but the major thesis at Clef is *The only security that matters is the security you use.*

This is a great idea to spread awareness!

Clef is definitely more centralized than Bitcoin, but it's also significantly less centralized than other forms of two-factor auth since Clef only keeps copies of public keys, but private keys are completely decentralized out to phones (where most 2fa uses a seed that is synced between the server and the phone).

Well Clef also has more than 30,000 sites using it - but the complexity is actually pretty major. QR codes don't work well for normal consumers because the mental model of scanning to log in is confusing.

I work on Clef, which is an easier to use version of this.

I'm one of the founders of Clef and can confirm this - we do not use comparisons or store any passwords! We use RSA public keys to authenticate. 
Also, Clef is two-factor auth, so when a phone is stolen the owner is still completely safe. The app is protected with TouchID or a 4 digit PIN to give them enough time to report the phone lost or stolen. 
Finally, Clef is a third party that specializes on building the best authentication in the world. Asking every site to rebuild their own authentication service or do armchair crypto is a recipe for disaster, and its why we see so many sites that don't follow best practices.
Happy to answer any other questions about Clef, or there is more info about our security here  -- getclef.com/security :)

Good question :) We're actually listed on the SQRL page as someone who implemented the same idea (we released Clef before Gibson started talking about SQRL). I think that SQRL is, at a high-level, totally in line with our thinking, but lacks a lot of the product-level nuance that has helped Clef spread to almost 100,000 sites so far.

The FIDO Alliance includes a lot of smart people who are thoughtful about how identity should work on the Internet, and the ideas behind the UAF spec align with how we think about this stuff. It's also a pretty political organization, and the specs are pretty sprawling compromises of "be everything for everyone". That's let a bunch of big names sign on to the organization with pretty much no real action. I'm hopeful that they'll eventually produce something we could use, but it's just not there today.
