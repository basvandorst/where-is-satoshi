Something I don't understand, how can bitcoins be stolen? Doesn't the blockchain record where the bitcoins in question went? And if there's a record of what goes where, couldn't someone mark stolen BTC as stolen and make them unusable?

But if we actually use this stuff, transactions cost an arm and a leg and a week, so it's not useful then either.....

I held, hoping it would fall further. Oops

Is there any way in which this is not 'scrip'?

Was that intentional?

Do they need to have the complete sandwiches in reserve if they have the components and labor to produce them?
Or, could American currency be considered on a 'gold standard' if it were backed by a known quantity of un-processed gold ore?

You have to turn cash into bitcoin somewhere, so you've got a point of origin into the bitcoin system. A wallet tied to a coinbase account tied to your bank account, for instance. There are more anonymous ways to get money into bitcoin, but unless you find somebody willing to trade cash for a loaded BTC wallet, you're gonna have an entry point of some kind. From there, anyone can look at the blockchain and see where the funds from that wallet go, or look at an end point and trace the money back to the origin point. Of course, you can tumble your BTC, making the tracing much, much harder, but if somebody decides the work is worth it, they can still figure it out eventually

as far as I can tell, 'hodl' is a misspelling of 'hold' that became a meme
