I explain 21's marketplace model as the spiritual successor to the nearly never utilized HTTP status code: "402 Payment Required".  Microtransactions in exchange for internet resources.

This looks great! 
In your video, I realized that I have had that problem where I can't tell what purchases have made me money and which have lost money.  This app helps out a lot in the department!
The only other issue that I have found (which I agree with about), is that while this works well for people who are investment only, it doesn't really work for people who have ever purchased anything.  
It would be very interesting to see how much the Bitcoins I have spent would be worth now if I had not spent them. This would involve a frozen USD value of each expenditure and a USD value grand total frozen at the value all the Bitcoins were spent at, as well as a "what-if" grand total real-time value of the Bitcoin if they were not spent. (I'm sure I didn't cover every angle of that concept, so feel free to correct me anyone).
Keep it up!

Hopefully they can get the legality issues figured out and they will do another group buy.
