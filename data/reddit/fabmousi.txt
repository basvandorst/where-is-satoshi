As the global demand increases, ATM fees will be reduced if more ATM builders enter the market and create a healthy market competition. If people don’t use those, I don’t see how we’ll ever see those machines expanding anytime and thus the fees decrease.

Then don’t try/propose anything new and stay in your corner... thanks for your contribution.

True, you have to scan and pay each item separately. I would say, from personal perspective only, that this is due to the beta phase of the LN so to avoid big amounts stuck on the network which actually happened to me previously (still waiting for answers from LivingRoomofSatoshi on this). Then once the payment executed, it instantly print a small paper for the waitress so she can prepare your order. Didn’t get an official receipt on my end though. She added that LN payments occur once every couple of months so this shows we are at really early stages yet, let’s see from here where we’ll land..

The purpose is not to keep more than USD 20 equivalent on the wallet, the goal is to experiment for now.

Personally not technically ready for that yet but would be top notch indeed.

Used the beta custodial wallet « Wallet of Satoshi », works fine ‘till developments so we can finally get control over the lightning funds ourselves.

He basically reminds people about the 2008 financial crisis, gives an accessible introduction to Bitcoin and the blockchain and explains how his Bank in France wouldn’t let him send a wire to get a very small amount of BTC. He went explaining that on the case of a new crisis, no banks would allow for BTC acquisition.

Seems like they are never stopping to innovate over there, thanks for sharing the info! Enjoy the buffet ;)

Are you fluent in French or would need English only propositions?

Thank you for this beauty, every contribution matters but this one a bit more than others!

Create a test account on [Coinfirm]( and if I recall correctly, you can insert up to three addresses for free (create more accounts with other emails if necessary). You can screen your addresses on their AML platform and if the C-Score related to your address(es) is higher than 65, the chances your bitcoins would be deeply investigated by an exchange are higher than the Eiffel tour, that I can tell you since it would mean their algorithms/data scientists could determine in some way a link between your coins and suspicious/criminal activities. And unlike some comments states, it goes far beyond just two or three hops...

Don’t you also encounter issues when you press the « . » after 0 ? For me cannot enter any number as soon as I press the « . », keyboard does not respond (iOS)

Talk about misinformation... this participant is a French veterinary called Rémi merely resembling to Ripple CEO... How can someone write such articles without knowing what he’s talking about?

Thank you all for your thoughts, I agree self-experimenting is the way though. Have a great one

Unless you are a business and implement 3D secure, you’re basically screwed unfortunately... The processor will always reimburse the complaining part whatever happens, the system sucks.

How is it so? What’s the difference with LN payments when you look at blockchain explorers?
@_date: 2019-05-05 09:36:24
Regulatory constraints could also be a blocking point as AML/CFT blockchain analysis becomes much more complicated with LN. Even though one might argue this would not matter for small amounts, internal policies of properly supervised exchanges require them to check every incoming/outgoing transfers...
