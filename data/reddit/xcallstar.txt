Nice reference text proof copy:  
Thanks for turning me on to the topic.
I used to have a text that was published online and distributed without restriction or fees except for if used in the instruction of mathematical coursework. It was on the topic of mathematical systems notation, formal proofs, and various other topics which are typically acquired through progressive study over time due to exposure rather than direct study. I wish I still had it, as I feel the two would go together well.

Does anyone know or can anyone think of any options for international users? I have funds that are now locked in bitfloor because of the fact that I do not have a US bank account. 
Any reply is appreciated. If you know of an exchange to which I can initiate an ACH deposit, please let me know ASAP.

Further complicating things is that in the US, the tax implications of selling BTC for USD to be transferred to another Exchange's account could be subject  to capital gains...

The ability of market average pricing to reflect short term gains/losses decreases as the interval increases.
This is especially true when 1000k buy&amp;sell orders are put up by market makers to set target prices.

Markets work in such a way that once appreciable trends can be recognized and/or predicted, behavior will shift to counterbalance the effect.
Prices have for the past month made gains of 10, 30, and 50 USD on each Monday following the weekend drop... 
So this weekend, prices will stagnate. This past week BTC got negative reporting in the media until Friday. When several neutral or even 'good' commentaries were presented. 
This will lead to a heavy inflow of new speculators on Monday and Tuesday and prices will rise.
Lets go back and look at When this whole surge started... I'm going to say March 18th.
What happened then?
Tradehill reopened. 
Minimum 10k USD to enter the market, experienced traders managing funds... they know to spread buy orders over several days.
1 week passes, consistent purchases at a very elevated trade volume with predictable price increases. 
Over the weekend new deposits aren't processed, typical btc holders feel that absence of pressure, selloff begins.
Monday, some new money... but its mostly Tradehill continuing to acquire BTC.
Time passes, people take note, start to make their own investments. Knowledge of bitcoin spreads.
Prices rise through the week, new money comes in, trade volumes test market depth. Things look good.
Weekend Selloff
More new money comes in, 23 major banks claimed to be DDOS'd, MT GOX included. Media labels it a 'crash' - people think to get into the market, see a strong 'recovery'
A lot of money changes hands. 
This weekend - stagnant prices. Monday - Very large rise as many see it as time to get into the currency of the future. Tuesday... Continues...
Wednesday or Thursday - I'm expecting to see another surge in DDOS attacks against major banks, MTGOX too, but people have diversified since then so it could affect more exchanges.
Another Crash, but this time its real (in percentage terms). Could see recovery but until then, TBD.
So what happened? Bitcoins changed hands. In the time since Tradehill began its operation, over 1 million BTC will have been acquired by society's financial elite.
Bitcoin is an unregulated market. It will be manipulated. The Fincen regulations are just a heads up that when assets are pulled out of the system, they'll be taxed. If you're a bitcoin millionaire, take a percentage and monetize a couple fiats, otherwise, enjoy the ride.

The following is an exchange from their twitter yesterday:

 Is there any way to withdraw fiat if I am not living in the US? Happy to go through all verification.
 bitfloor ‏ 4h
 We will have more information for international users in the next few days.
4:57 PM - 17 Apr 13 · Details
It seems like international users are being put at the end of the queue. 
There is currently a 3 - 4 day backlog for identification verification, and after that it takes 2-3 days for transfers to US citizens to go through?
I have absolutely no interest in withdrawing USD or any other currency. 
Regardless, thank you for your reply.
@_date: 2013-04-26 17:57:34
Don't paint bitfloor in too positive of a light. International users who transferred BTC to bitfloor and sold there were not given any option in order to recover their USD funds. ACH transfer was the only option offered... A type of bank transfer unique to the USA.
@_date: 2013-04-27 02:23:34
Rumor has it that Bitfloor went down because althought they did register with FinCEN, they did not licensed with NYS as a money transmitter, and that even if they did, their accounts would have been closed anyway due to 'risk' factors.

There are tons of confounding factors. The bitcoin exchanges are on their way to becoming the most competitive experiment in pure commodity exchange... A confluence of all global pressures.
Eg. Look at gold prices since the 70's. Gold prices shot up up to 1979 (Peaked in Jan 1980),  as the Cold War entered a new phase (1972-1979 vs 1979-1985).
More recently, look at the price of Gold relative to the Iraq war. 
What can we pull from this? Commodity markets are affected by conflict. The economic policies of Japan are only one aspect. I would say a larger factor is the increased levels of tension in the nations surrounding the East China Sea. 
If North Korea does anything, there are huge implications as specialized economies (S. Korea &amp; Japan) shift toward war economies. 
War is a horrible time to have investments in anything other than war. War is the destruction of realized capital. Commodities offer a hedge against the losses associated with conflict.

Thieves steal assets. Whether the unit of the asset is indicated as USD, EUR, CNY, oz gold, lbs flour, or Arbeitskraft, it is the action and not the medium that is condemned.
Bitfloor's US bank accounts were processed through localtill to deposits at Capital One. BoA was the venue for these deposits and I believe Capital One 360 was also accepted (but was not routed through localtill). 
I'd be curious to know whether this would have happened if Capital One 360 were not offered as an option to make deposits.

There are no exchanges left that accept ACH transfers.
aurumxchange [.] com does not accept wire transfers anonymously.
virwowx requires personal information:  "Important: Correct personal information is necessary to transfer money between your VirWoX account and normal bank accounts!"
AFAIK there are no longer any accessible anonymous exchanges. Please, if anyone knows otherwise, contact me. Anonymity is a key aspect of Bitcoins. Names are not accounts, and though regulatory trade practices/laws may apply to citizens of a particular state, no law is universal, and no law can apply to a universally accessible commodity.

That is how people are measuring the value of BTC, is it not?
If you look at logs of when Exchanges 'crashed' or were taken offline, it follows a very predictable pattern.
Look at how fake the crash was...
The 30 day moving average was at ~50 when the peak (and subsequent crash) occurred. Letting the price drop below this point doesn't make sense. Bitcoin is both a short and long term investment.
Review: 
Bitcoin proponents (and the entrenched 'New' money alike) will now argue for the importance of price stability. Its not hard to guarantee slow steady growth when you're able to say SELL and drop the price by 75%, and then say BUY and scoop up the same volume that you held before at half the price.

The official perspective is that currencies are issued by and assigned value by central governments/banks. BTC is not issued by either, but is recognized as having some value.
If anything, btc has the potential to take on the converse role of earlier  'behind the scenes' currency denominations, a la 
Except instead of being centrally issued, it is universally issued.

I was able to successfully withdraw my BTC. Unfortunately no information is available for international users, and even then, I would want my holdings transferred to another exchange.

How am I supposed to provide identification of the account holder of the individual who opened the exchange's account?

Issues with N. Korea have the potential to have a devastating effect on regional economies... Any change in risk (even a slight increase) can be hedged against in a variety of ways. Commodity trading can be used to hedge against this risk.
Not to mention, the Bank of Japan stimulus announcement should leave individuals and investors very willing to pump the BTC value.
So we'll be going down around 7:45, rebound by 8:15

I agree.
It is irrational to think that trade volume would be at 20k on mt gox when the past two weekends have had ~150k transactions.
Now its just a matter of who is willing to wait longer to monetize the 15k user queue on mtgox alone, not counting other exchanges... 
If there were an opportune time to exploit market momentum, it would be right now. 
Anyone who wanted substantial holdings already has them, bitcoins are going mainstream and all these comparisons to gold in the media recently are giving people the idea that this currency is the next thing.
How fast can mt gox address the user queue? Other exchanges? What happens when new users come in? Well... look at the past several Mondays.

It really isn't all that difficult to recall very long character strings, so long as you establish a mechanism which is easy to recall.
An example would be something like remembering 'f7u13' instead of trying to recall for rage comics. 
You could take something like the keystroke movements for 'password' and reproduce them with your fingers shifted inward, with index fingers on g and h instead of f and j respectively. 'password' becomes 'osddeitf'
reproduce it, and just decide on certain digits of irrational numbers between each character, like sqrt(3)/2, pi, and e
sqrt(3)/2 = 0.86602540378...
pi = 3.141592653589793238...
Decide which digits to use (every digit for sqrt(3)/2, every other for pi, and the first 10 digits of e in reverse)
Add in 'password' again, but holding shift and moving your reference home row up one row. ---&gt; ')QWW
and decide on the order. We'll just go through taking one from each...
so the things we need to remember are:
* password - one in
* sqrt(3)/2 - first 10 
* pi - every other
* e - first 10 in reverse
* password - SHIFT &amp; one up
o038) s842Q d658W d621W e058@ i252( t298$ f491E 327 782 86
p          a        s1        s2       w       o       r        d    1     2    3
I'll give you that its only 48 characters, but from this you can go anywhere
p - o038)
a - s842Q
s1 - d658W
s2 - d621W
w - e058@
o - i252(
r - t298$
d - f491E
1 - 327
2 - 782
3 - 86
So lets just make a 96 character key, because what the hell, what not. We'll just use what we already had but the second time through just use caps if caps wasn't used, or shift if shift wasn't used (and the opposite)
o038) s842Q d658W d621W e058@ i252( t298$ f491E 327 782 86 O038) S) D ^ %*w d ^  E)%*@ i)%*2 t f$(!e  &amp;*@ *^

I can't help but see this through a critical lens... ASICMINER is a current investment for future dividends... The latest Avalon preorders are paid for in BTC... BFL sees a change of 10k order volume at the end of last week before doubling their prices and reducing performance projections by 20%... all the while without having even started production runs.
Its human nature to want to invest in something that we're being told will be big, but BTC now is worth more than BTC later... I'd be curious to see a broader application of valuation analysis.
