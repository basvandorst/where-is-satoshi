How do I go about doing my taxes if I mine BTC, LTC and DOGE? Am I completely fucked now?
@_date: 2014-03-16 22:11:24
THIS IS SO FUN
@_date: 2014-03-17 19:41:09
I have an mhtml file of it, do you have an email I can send it to?
@_date: 2014-03-13 03:07:33
Because my old GPU can't efficiently mine BTC and LTC?
@_date: 2014-03-05 06:00:09
I was wondering something: aren't private keys all you need to use the bitcoins in that address? How come there is a password needed for this key?
Is this somehow different from an unencrypted backup of the keys using multibit where it strictly says that if anyone else gets these keys, they could spend it? What happens if someone guesses your key? Can they just steal your bitcoins?
I'm still a bit new and I'm still not up to speed with the private/public key affair, receiving addresses or whatnot. Any explanations would be greatly appreciated!

No fking way

I LOVE THIS GAME
@_date: 2014-04-16 11:30:29
Pretty sure that's in Japanese
@_date: 2014-03-16 15:03:59
Sorry I meant to say 1 instead of 0 xD, I was tired

I think this will be my new Amazon
@_date: 2014-11-22 14:06:47
Not really, a false sense of security can be pretty bad

TO THE END!
@_date: 2014-03-26 06:42:19
But I have to file my taxes soon! I don't mind paying the extra few bucks that theyre gonna ask for because it's really not worth the trouble (for the low amount I have).
I only mined them for the novelty of having it
@_date: 2014-03-13 02:54:45
Thanks! I'll have to take a look into this later
@_date: 2014-03-16 05:32:56
Where did you get THOSE btcs from? It didnt say that on the original picture
@_date: 2014-04-03 03:45:14
Can anyone explain to me what PGP is? I've seen it here and there, and even after doing some googling, I still haven't the slightest clue what it is
@_date: 2014-03-05 06:28:17
Not gonna lie, I didn't really find the answer to my question... Or maybe I just completely missed it
@_date: 2014-04-03 04:37:02
OMG TY! This helped so much!
Is there an portable app I could use to do this stuff? Basically instead of having it in my browser, I could run it from a truecrypt container?
@_date: 2014-03-16 04:59:53
If you have *that* much BTC, why dont you just use the original bitcoin-qt client with a dedicated machine? I have a small machine that runs two 2TB HDDs in raid 1, I backup the wallet in a TrueCrypt every time I spend or receive. For additional insurance, I backup the TrueCrypt file containing the wallet backup to Google Drive as well.
EDIT: I'm glad your BTC is safe though!
EDIT 2: I meant raid 1 instead of 0 &gt;.&lt;, I was tired
@_date: 2014-03-16 05:35:57
Holy shit is that legit?
@_date: 2014-04-09 22:40:09
make a text file with each key having its own separate line, then just do an import of the key into a multibit wallet
@_date: 2014-03-05 06:38:51
Thank you! The video definitely helped
@_date: 2014-03-02 18:06:15
HAHA DOUGLAS ADAMS REFERENCE!
@_date: 2014-03-25 18:31:36
If you mine a cryptocurrency, how do you go about paying the taxes for it? Does anyone know? I don't want to go to jail :s

This is a wiki for a game... I read through it too and I didn't get anything useful from it
@_date: 2014-03-16 05:23:40
That's less than 2 pennies.

I'm not exactly sure as to what you mean by "Why they three are different to you". I own different cryptos because I've mined each of them, my holdings are sitting at 40/30/30 in terms of worth in fiat for BTC, LTC and DOGE.
@_date: 2014-03-10 16:14:21
The comments on that video make me want to cry
@_date: 2014-05-25 19:43:53
Lol probably when the USD no longer has any value. $100k would be a ridiculous market cap
@_date: 2014-03-21 01:22:31
I personally love this game. Just keep moving on!
Most people on this site probably aren't interested, so I wouldn't continue posting here. You could try to go to other BTC gambling websites and advertise there
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:31:12
The article says "bitcoin and other virtual currencies like property" though
@_date: 2014-03-05 06:40:07
I usually don't, but I left it unprotected when I made a backup just to see what it looked like. I keep it inside a TrueCrypt volume anyway, so that there's an extra layer of protection.
But thank you for the response! I didn't know a private key was *all* that you needed.

He could be on a gag order

I've spent more time than I care to admit on this game with the iPhone (30+ resets)
