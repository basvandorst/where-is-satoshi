It has to be or the technology will never be adopted. I assume internet literacy would also have to improve a bit, but I might be very wrong on that (I doubt today's Snapchat generation knows much about how computers or the internet works).
It took a long time with cars too. Even until a few years ago knowing how your engine works could safe you an expensive trip to the mechanic. Only now with modern cars having a diagnostic interface for a mechanic, even enthusiasts might better seek out a professional.

But you kinda have to know how bitcoin/blockchain works to use a wallet securely or to avoid stupid mistakes. It gets better on a daily basis, but there are still many things that can go wrong when not used properly.

Huh, I drive past there almost every day. I had no idea.

It's never without fees as far as I know, but it's negligible compared to what I see posted here sometimes.
I don't transfer money a lot, but I do it all from the bank's online platform. Fees are listed before making a transaction. Largest amount was a couple of thousands a few years back with a student account of UBS. As far as I remember I just payed a 10$ fee and it took two days to arrive. That was to Japan.
More recent transfers are a couple of hundred a couple of times from a standard account at ZKB. Also took two days only with negligible fees. Those transactions were going to Malaysia.
It's two days because I make the transfer when the next day in the other country already started.
What kind of offers do you see?

And here I thought it needs a conman to do these things, apparently you can just asked them normally without any trickery.
@_date: 2014-01-21 13:51:23
Oh.. well yeah. I don't know but of course you should be informed about your options. If there is a cheaper option than WU that transfers the money in reasonable time of course you should use it.

Maybe that really differs depending on the person. As a Swiss citizen any Swiss bank would accept me, and before when I was a student, I did indeed get a pretty good deal with UBS (free credit card for instance).
If we're talking about "Swiss people" in general, not having a bank account is rather unusual. Even opening a bank account for your child or godchild is a common gift among Swiss people. That's because standard fees for account maintenance is practically zero until you're an adult.
@_date: 2014-01-21 15:41:53
I'm slowly realizing that now.
@_date: 2014-01-21 10:57:42
With my Swiss bank it takes a day to wire the money (depends a bit on what time it is in the other country) and the transaction cost is around 5 to 10$ regardless of the amount. And I'm not even a special customer with a lot of money or something. It's the standard rate.
You guys just have horrible offers. It's good that Bitcoin provides international competition.
@_date: 2014-08-23 22:32:05
Really? Why else if not because of the ongoing prosecution of Swiss Banks by the US Financial Services would they damage their own business?
@_date: 2014-08-23 22:32:59
Nope, they're from southern Germany. Get your stereotypes right at least.

Well, that's just insane.

Instead it seems everyone is so excited that they upvote all of them.

Can't another bot just check for the comments and posts of the other bot to check for that?

It's not *that* simple. The CIA can't force a company to build backdoors into software. They can however force the company to give access to already available backdoors or mechanisms as long as it is involved with little to know additional cost or effort.
So what you describe in your second paragraph is exactly possible. It's unlikely that MS built the trojan themselves. That would probably be illegal even in the US.

Here the [English website]( that explains how it works in this particular case.

The US government under Obama has forced Swiss banks to report on all US citizens who have an account with them. This has lead to Swiss banks to refuse most US citizens when they want to open an account.
It's a metaphor and it's using old facts.
@_date: 2017-04-20 04:12:51
A Swiss bank account won't help you these days. Especially not as an American. They won't let you open one without reporting back to the government. Might have been proper a decade ago.

You can only blame him for being naïve. Too trusting that Trump isn't just in it for himself.

Yeah, I tried to translate it and "property tax" came up. I hoped it's not just about real estate but apparently that gets lost in translation. So a "wealth tax" maybe?
And yeah, it's additional to inflation, but can be more fine tuned with caps and tiers.
@_date: 2015-03-02 16:12:27
That's always the case when you have property tax. All your cash/savings etc. have a tax on it.

Isn't it more useful to say it's backed by the US economy? A working, healthy economy leads to services and supply of goods and the money is the way to exchange these goods and services within the system. The US dollar works because it's being used by the US economy (and also outside, I know) so it's worth something. All you need is trust that the economy keeps working and growing. Arms seem only a part of the equation that's not necessarily required.

Yeah, the search for a replacement for the dollar has been going on for a while. This just resurfaces because of the shutdown and the debt ceiling.
@_date: 2013-10-16 11:30:26
Yupp, I doubt it has much to do with Bitcoin in particular. If you were doing transactions in cash of these amounts you'd get tons of questions about it.

When I lived in Japan I online-wired me some money (a million Yen) to my Japanese bank account. They went batshit crazy and called my university and my dorm to reach me. They didn't seem to understand I just did that by myself the night before and just wanted some money on my bank account in Japan.. like.. you know that's what's it for, right?

It's reasonably "difficult" to do for Android phones to discourage normal users to try it. Of course you don't just "give" root to your users, but making it a bit more accessible for people that want it, can't hurt.. well of course, Apple was never about freedom, so it's not surprising they won't allow it.
@_date: 2013-07-23 04:47:21
Fold proteins then. It's also cool, but doesn't give you any money.

True that, they however don't seem to target anybody anyway as they're just collecting lots and lots of information as far as we know now. It's still unclear how they filter it and what exactly they're doing with it.
