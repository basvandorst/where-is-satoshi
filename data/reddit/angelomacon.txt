If I had a significant BTC holding than i'd probably be selling off half my stash this week.
Since I don't, i have the luxory of not really stressing about it.  I'm just waiting on the crash or some period of level prices that probably means no crash is coming.

The true believers are trying to keep the price up, but I think they're going to run out of money soon.

Man, I'm sure most people posting about canceled orders are being honest.  Just to throw it out there though, I just received 1 BTC that I bought at 211 last week.  So it's not an across the board cancel any order during a price spike.
I'm hoping it really is just a shitty algorithm.  It'd suck if the apparently most stable and convenient way to buy bitcoins turned out to be shady.

It's a bit of a non sequitor when you look at it from that POV.  Some people here certainly are that naive.  
I think most view in the right order.  Not that BTC will lead to a true free market, but rather in order to obtain a freer society you need something like BTC.

Coinbase prices have been expensive today ever since they hit that ran out of bitcoins for the day this afternoon (EST).

I think the USD will cause the USD to crash.  The more likely scenario if BTC takes off is that it forces central bankers to be a lot less loosey goosie with monetary policy.

Good point.  Whenever volume increases like it has in the last 2 weeks, they are buying from exchanges to make up the difference.  But you're right, most of their transactions are just moving within their own network.
I use them and like them for the most part.  If they could knock a little off the transaction fees I'd be pretty happy.  They were pretty good at pegging prices to Bitstamp until this week, but I think the blame lies more with Bitstamp on that issue.

The Trade books at the exchanges are really screwy looking, so i think this volatility is going to last the night.

I'm in the neighborhood, I'd be interested if you could put something together.
Why the downvotes for the OP?  I'm relatively new to the subreddit, but I can't imagine these meetup posts are in the same league as the "Coinbase sucks", "All time high price", "How do i buy BTC?" type of threads.

Anybody who would panic sell, already did so in April.  I think basically everyone holding BTC in May were true believers, hence you're not seeing the big sell off at 270+.

I get what you're saying.  The trend is a slow, steady growth in the base of long term believers/hoarders with boom and busts caused by speculators.  The China factor makes it impossible to figure out how much of this run up is the new norm and how much is speculation.

If anything, there a bunch of dealers who will make out bigtime.  Addicts aren't exactly known to save their money for a rainy day.

Between their population and being the second largest country by GDP, don't you think the end result is that they end up having a significant amount of bitcoins?  If it didn't happen soon, it was going to happen when bitcoins are actually used for trade and not just a store of value.

It's going to be 500 by the time you come back to read this thread!

I wonder if anyone is getting those can't process transaction because it was flagged by our fraud prevention thing?

The upside is any assets like stocks and real estate would remain as valuable, but just have to be sold in BTC.  
Pensions and savings would take a big hit but sadly I think that's going to happen even without bitcoin due to central banks printing money.
Still, I think we're decades away from fiat currencies dying out.  Plenty of time for middle aged folks to see it coming and diversify their retirement plan.

Here's my counter to that.  Since Coinbase has to buy from an exchange, they can never compete directly with another exchange on transaction fees.
They charge 1% because they have to buy through an exchange paying the 0.2%-0.5%.  Than they have to charge a premium on that to make any money.  If a new US based exchange pops up they can easily beat them on price since there's no middle man.

Right, I think this kind of stuff comes with time.  A year ago, it was hard just buying BTC even if you were a younger tech savy person.  
BTC started out with only libertarian types, than black marketeers and than tech savvy speculators.  None of which really desire such a service.  Coinbase popped up when more casual young people who are less idealogical driven started to show interest.
Give it a year, if this experiment is still growing and middle aged folks who have real money to lose show interest than you'll have old school bank type of companies who hold your money, insure it and charge fees instead of lending out your money and pretending that it's still in the vault.

It seems like it mirrors bitstamp pretty well most of the time.  To be fair, the couple times I saw the buy price significantly higher, the sell price was much higher as well.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:31:01
And... it's back to 650.  Roller coaster baby!
@_date: 2013-11-15 22:10:05
Is there any news or is just a random sell off?
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:12:18
If bitcoin really does become a real alternative currency, you're going to see other new competitive currencies.  Any real or perceived weakness (or strength) will factor into which handful of currencies end up being accepted by the masses in the end.

That went from 700 to 500 to 600 in about 5 minutes.  Awesome.

I think the biggest pro bitcoin argument will end up being that it's taking off in China.  "Don't over regulate and drive the industry to the evil Chinese" argument will win enough Senators over to continue to ignore BTC.

I live in a hipster part of Brooklyn and I'm kind of shocked that I don't hear about bitcoin or see local stores ever accepting them.
Good story!
