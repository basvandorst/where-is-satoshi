It's not very useful for payments though, as relatively low amounts of transactions congests the network as seen in December. This results in dramatically increased fees and transaction times. So ironically the more popular it gets, the less useful it becomes. 
Hence OP is probably right that it'll be some years before it's actually usable as a reliable payment mechanism.

Only if it's decentralized.

Yeah, I'm just trying to figure out what others ways to skin the cat exists, if not for the exchanges. Wiring to an offshore exchange still requires a bank to perform the wire. Any non-trivial amount sent to offshore jurisdiction banks are going to require positive ID, justification for the transfer and what not. Highly unlikely it's going to be approved, and if it is, the information will be passed on to tax authorities due to AML and KYC regulations passed in the last few years. So it seems to me if for example EU, China and US passes legislation to disallow exchanges - then it could well kill cryptotrading, as the exchanges are the chokepoint. 
Unless there is other ways to get into/out of crypto that doesn't need exchanges, but I'm not aware of any?

The price is just a reflection of what someone is willing to buy for.
So if absolutely no one wanted to buy, the price would be zero.

Forgive the noob question, but in a hypothetical situation where banks shut down transactions to exchanges, how would you convert fiat from/to cryptocurrency? 
You write exchanges are only "one avenue of hundreds", but I don't understand what other avenues are available for getting fiat into / out of crypto? Thanks.

But then it looses the concept of practical immutability because the controlling party can easily modify the blockchain at will. Just like a normal centralized database. Seeing as blockchain has no other advantages over a normal data store, a centralized blockchain makes little sense.

Since transactions fees are correlated with network traffic, and given that average transactions and outputs are approx 50% of what they were in December when the congestion occurred (according to Blockchain.info and outputs.today), isn't this just an indication that there's half as much traffic? Wouldn't fees rise dramatically again, as soon as the traffic shoots back up to December levels or higher?

About the supposed immutability: This only applies if you have a decentralized network that verifies the blockchain. If it's a centralized blockchain, or if one actor has control of 51% of the blockchain, the entire blockchain can be manipulated as you see fit, including adding, deleting and changing.
