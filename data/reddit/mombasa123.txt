I suggest a donation to the Mida Creek Conservation Community Awareness Group (MCCA) in Kenya to allow them to install a de-centralized Solar PV electrical mini-grid.
MCCA is a group that consists of villagers that live in a UNESCO bird biosphere reserve in the coastal region of Kenya.  They pool their revenues from providing bird spotting walks to tourists, canoe rides to see flamingoes and other birds and moonlit dinners for tourists from a small restaurant.  From the pools of revenues 30% goes to a bursary for school expenses for the villagers' children.
Unfortunately as the villagers live in one of the poorest areas in the coastal region of Kenya they are unable to afford electrical connections to the grid.  
A de-centralized electrical mini-grid will allow modular, scalable and efficient usage of Solar PV energy to provide electrical energy for fridges to store vaccines/medicines/milk, freezers to store fish instead of having to dispose harvested fish at throwaway prices immediately, irrigation pumps to help increase yield of small farms in the area, a de-salination plant to provide clean water from the existing brackish water, and lighting that can help conserve the endangered mangrove trees in the area that are sometimes burnt to provide light.
There are currently 52 homesteads that can be assisted in the area.  Each homestead consists of around 5 to 7 homes with each home containing around 7 to 8 familiy members.  A typical homestead can be seen here: 
Using a new de-centralized swarm electrical energy product from a Swiss company called Power-Blox ( a mini-grid in the area can be setup within 3 to 4 months for the villagers networking all 52 homesteads together to create a networked electrical grid.
A donation to install a de-centralized Solar PV mini-grid will greatly improve the ability of the villagers to improve their earning ability and uplift their lives.
