I don't know how this would work with taxes... I think if you were specifically employed by someone (in the US) you would still have to be paid in USD. The way to potentially make this work from a legal standpoint is to do everything as independent contracts.

It sounds like you're pretty spot-on. This applies to each paragraph you've written. Your hunches are mostly accurate.
It is very simple to place/cancel sell/buy orders (which is one of the major draws of crypto trading), just as the guy with the cheap fish could decide to pack up and leave. Once he does leave, other sellers may be able to command higher prices.
In a stock exchange, they charge you a considerable amount of up-front cost/profits to operate a booth. This forces those trading low amounts in a stock exchange to go for high-profit trades that exceed the booth cost. Cryptocurrency is not like that -- with cryptocurrency the rent is basically free. This concept contributes a large share to the volatility of the market. This fact, including the idea that cryptos are only backed in the same sense that wages are backed by the work you do, makes it incredibly difficult to value.
My $300 quote isn't on the money, but was used for more illustrative purposes. Imagine all the BTC markets as being different fish markets in the same district. You might have to walk across the street to a different one (losing a drop of juiciness of the fish you bought along the way), but in that one you may be able to sell the fish for a couple dollars higher (which would negate the lost juice drop). Each market has it's own price. The $300 fish seller might have done their research on a specific market and asked for more money in that market accordingly. Only the buyers/sellers that visit every market can accurately estimate the average value and price accordingly. With the $320 price, there might be mimics in a market that has chosen a bit higher prices for BTC to USD. This could either be based on those pesky booth fees or a specifically higher demand in that market for BTC.
You may be hearing different prices, but until the seller retracts or sells all of their fishes at the $300(ish) price point, that price will not move. That is the new value of the fish. Also, as another point of interest, each market only has a specific buy capacity. This is called the buy wall. Say you have 20 sushi chefs that come to buy about 100 fish in total each day. The guy trying to sell 100,000 fish in that market for an ultra cheap price is very clearly bluffing. Days where there are only 50 fish to sell force the buy wall to incredible heights. Since we can assume that the product (all the same) is not inferior, we can assume ulterior motives by the seller.

Well, there are 30k or so BTC being sold at $300 or so a pop. Since this is so many coins, anyone that wants to sell their coins will actually have to sell them for *less* than $300 to get them bought immediately.
By creating a panic that the price is dropping (which it technically has because this one seller believes they are only worth $300) they cause other sellers to undercut them in the hopes that they will actually be able to sell. Everyone then tries to undercut each other and the price plummets. When $300 seems expensive, the seller then takes their coins back and reaps the benefits of buying at a low price.
Technically what a sell wall this big means is that all of those cheap coins must be bought before the price can rise again. If they aren't all bought quickly (because the perceived value is above $300) the price will continue to fall because the demand doesn't meet it.
Edit: the best way to imagine a crypto market is a bunch of people selling the *exact same* product in "pretty much" the same place. You would always want to get the cheapest price in this market. If it's a small fish market and a big catcher brings in 100s of times the supply of the market in and demands a lower price, everyone's screwed until the big fisher takes their fish off the market or they sell them all.

Assuming these challenges are from AMEX (which they usually are), have you considered signing up for a business card with them? Even if you don't use it too much, I feel like it would put a bunch of pressure on them to figure it out instead of automatically finding you in the wrong.
On another note, I didn't think about this aspect of Bitcoin or other cryptos for that matter, but it's a very big strength. It does rely on a lot more trust, but even in certain situations that can be mitigated by the application of the system.

Heck I wouldn't be surprised if it was someone in their company that placed that massive buy order.

I think the argument could be made that everyone that has at least one satoshi owns a proportional stake in the system itself. It's somewhat like a financial co-op. There is no one owner, everyone that uses it is the owner.

That could maybe be argued as him promoting his stake in the system by attempting to increase valuation. Other than that, the word commercial doesn't quite apply to Bitcoin's system.

To me it sounds like he's trying to set up a framework that the general population can trust without having to understand the idiosyncrasies of the currency. I think for most people to realistically invest in Bitcoin it's going to have to be seen as a brokerage offering of sorts (and maybe even be offered though banks).
I don't think banks really care about what currency they use, they just want to make money.

I agree in regards to the "waiting in the wings" statement. This is where other crypto users come back to when their choice crypto fails. I think there will always be support for the *idea* of crypto and Bitcoin is the most established. 
Unfortunately, you're right... If there's no one mining that hadn't invested in equipment beforehand, the difficulty will be tough to overcome. That's why it will be very dangerous if the price drops too much. On the other hand, I'm convinced that miners like the *idea* of Bitcoin even more than me, so I'm guessing they will still be around to protect the network.

Someone was saying easiest way is through router settings. If you don't have access you probably can do it through terminal. Check some of top posts.

I love the banter but maybe it's time to chill if everyone is watching us. I really dig the sense of community that more openness brings, but maybe it's time to put a or commenting policy in or two. I hate that it might sacrifice more of the community, but being reasonable is never a bad idea. It may have become a toddler from infancy, but Bitcoin has grown up -- it's time to act like it.
