Please no. EVERYONE associates the "matrix look" with "hackers" and other "computery" stuff they don't understand. 
This is not what we need for wide spread adoption. Pictures of physical coins may be bad, but this is worse.

Exactly. The "matrix" effect is appealing to who? Everyone that already owns bitcoin. Meanwhile Aunt Karen at the craft fair will view it as "scary hacker money".

Why don't we just call it a bit?
And 1 BTC is a bitcoin?

Coinbase is slammed today. Non of their orders are going through until Friday I think.

This is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
Just send your money to me instead.
What happens when you run out of funds and still need to increase your bet because you lost, yet again?

Give it 6 months to a year.
Same transfer time as memes.
Another year it'll  be on tshirts at the flea market just like rage faces.
