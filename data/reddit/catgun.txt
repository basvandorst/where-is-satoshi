I said "most business transactions right now".  Sure, there's no doubt a few businesses where Bitcoin can still make sense.  But not _most_ businesses. 
But be my guest, stick your head in the sand.  It just means that coins with better governance, and better responsiveness to business needs will eat Bitcoin's lunch,

Yeah, real soon now. Bitcoin partisans have been promising LN for years.

Your technically correct anecdote does not change the fact that Bitcoin's high transaction fees and long confirmation times make it utterly impractical for most businesses to use.

Right, nitpick what I said, while ignoring the fact that it's absolutely insane to pay $5 for a transaction fee and wait days for the confirmation.

Some businesses also want to continue to use Bitcoin as a currency.  Which is impossible with BTC right now, with transaction fees at $30 - $40/transaction, and confirmation times measured in days.

There are 431,000 people on this sub.  Even if only 1% of them are immature trolls, that's still ~4000 people.  4000 people can cause a lot of trouble.

The customer pays either way.  Instead of the product costing x, the merchant prices the product at x+2%.

Monero, Zcash, Grin -- any coin that is actually fungible.

Anything is debatable, so that's an empty statement.  
I didn't say there were thousands that were better.
