Incorrect - I didn't say to sell at $19,000. Never stated that. I said the bull run was over at $19,000. Which it was. So I encouraged people to get smart and start trading on the volatility. If you didn't listen that is fine, go join the herd - We are hunting over here.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:25:50
You learned incorrectly, you are supposed to actively trade. Not sell your entire investment! I would jump back in, but pick your buy and sell points at about a 10% delta.

You don't, already have enough investors at this time.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:55:08
I'm not predicting the markets, the trading platform is. You don't think investment companies use them, you think they just put in trades ad-hoc? You can be a sheep and buy and hold, or be a player and be profitable. Your choice, but calling trading "gambling" is completely incorrect. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:35:27
Lol - It will surely fluctuate if it drops down to $7000 and won't be smooth, it will be more in a manner of which you've seen a $3K decline over the last few weeks. Sudden bursts followed by slow movement upwards. 
Powerful pattern to avoid selloffs by your classic holders. Everyone holding onto their Bitcoin without using it is a frog in boiling water.

Lets just say it's confirmed now by the market and world economy. Sorry to say so, but the bias was on your side.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:19:06
Good try, but there is nothing negative about me being excited for people to buy and trade at this low point. I won't resort to calling you names, just watch my videos I posted in December and you'll see I'm not a troll.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:12:42
It's not easy, it's extremely difficult. That's why I have a very expensive program doing it for me. Obviously you haven't seen my videos. Care to take my challenge I openly posted? I expect not.
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:32:00
Sure, he needed to drop it as low as possible to buy in and ride it up to his mark - $20K. When he said it might go to $20K before the burst, it was a very well calculated number that stuck in everyone's head and became a FOMO mentality for those entering the market late.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:23:04
You are completely correct - Past success cannot predict future success. Good thing I have a program that makes the predictions for me. You must be new to trading algorithms used by Axa, let me know if you have any questions.

@_date: 2018-01-18 16:13:51
I know right, just getting people riled up. I hope some people made the right decision to buy yesterday, I really do. You may not think it, but I'm all for the people and NOT the hedge funds getting the majority of gains from crypto. I'm simply saying that buying in a low, and selling in a high, is not a bad idea. Don't let anyone convince you otherwise. It also helps stabilize the market and make things less volatile. Was yesterday a good time to buy? YES! Was it gambling? I would say not, I would say it was a very well informed decision.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:17:48
You can count on me being back - And why would you say me encouraging trading is "blah blah blah"? This is an exciting time for people to jump back in when they couldn't previously! 
Of course it's nothing new, so why would you not be excited to buy in now at such a low point if you see it back at 20K by the summer? Illogical.
Thank you volatility, thank you holders!!!

You have no idea how the market works. Holding causes increased market volatility, trading "buffers" the market. So buy holding you can increase the downfall we are seeing, or you can trade and profit while buffering it for everyone. So you can make a difference by trading and making others the "winners" as you call them.

How does my trading appear from your perspective now, after I warned that you would need to start trading to survive? We've made a 40% ROI since the posts, I love this fluctuation! I hope it continues to sink to 7K, that's my target. Everything past 7K was FOMO.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:48:01
It's all in the videos, just do the math yourself - I don't have the time to make you understand. We have a 40% ROI since I posted the evidence to Youtube, thankfully we aren't sheep and don't have a buy and hold strategy. 
Like I said when it was at 19K in my first post, the bull run is over and you must start trading to survive.

The primary point for me is to allow me to cover a larger spread for market swings. Such as the one we are in right now!
So it benefits both parties. A larger amount in the trading "pool" means trading will be made possible and further leveraged over a larger BTC price drop. I gain from that.
Your gain, well is obvious - An ROI that I'll let you calculate from my videos.
Reach out to me through Youtube if you are interested.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:22:35
I'll try to best answer without repeating myself. I can't go into how the algorithm is different in much detail. There are two main differences:
 1 ) My algorithm started development over 4 years ago when I began mining. It's been refined countless times, and is constantly updated based on the latest market activity. It has many variables for adjustment, all well understood on how they will effect profit. The parameters that most algorithms provide allowing you to adjust for optimal performance are low in number.
 2 ) You don't need to know anything about how to apply the parameters, I've set them already at what I believe to be the optimum. You don't need to know how to set trades based on the move in spot price, the chart depths, avoiding fees, market depth, bot activity, etc. and how much to risk on each trade. That is already done.
As far as how the program works - Yes, the program is indeed an API. It interfaces with the Exchange in realtime to enter buys and sells. You don't need to know anything about how it functions, I'll take care of that side.
As for as visibility - Unfortunately I can't give you insight into the trading history. That could allow someone to backward engineer my algorithm and cannot be risked. The videos I've released on Youtube is the furthest I can show behind the curtain.
Let me know if you want to know how to proceed.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:48:41
That is an error in logic. Let me propose an example - Suppose Bitcoin was at $15000 a the start of the day, and ended the 24 hour period at the exact same price of $15000. Now I'm sure we can agree it would have moved in one direction or the other during that time. If it went to $15,500 for example, I would have sold some Bitcoin and made $500 for every BTC traded. Then when it dropped back to $15,000 I would have purchased some at that relative lower price. The market moved - But a buy and hold strategy would have netted you nothing in this case.
Does that help you understand why intelligently trading is essential this new market?
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:12:08
Yes seeing the actual trading results like this is extremely rare! Firms would never make them public to show what their automated platform(s) are doing, and personal traders simply don't have bots that can perform on this level. 
I'm not exaggerating, platforms performing on this level are at the investor level - These are results you might at a very large bank or trading institution. 
If anyone has better results than what I've consistently provided, then call me out! It comes down to having publicly available proof.
I can't be honest and say the results can be an expected average, they have been much higher but also much lower. I've lost money on days, it still happens. It all depends on the market and how it's being played. I can get into more detail in email.
Yes - I can't stress this enough, the trading algorithm is trading 24/7 unless I turn it off or reboot the server. That means it has orders set at all times or is ready to enter a market order at any time based on market conditions. No human intervention is required - In fact this would be a negative, I don't want the bias or worry of having to make decisions. I've made the algorithm much "smarter" that I could ever be, so I'm completely out of the loop.
Yes the program very rarely executes an order with fees - Virtually all buys and sells have no fees associated. This is not a promotion, it will extend into the foreseeable future.
Yes, there are no minimums or anything of that nature. Loan can be for any amount you choose, and for any time you choose.
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:49:51
That's the entire point - You can't predict them, so why would a hold be any safer at this point? If you held over the last 24 hours, you lost $1000 per Bitcoin. If you traded, you gained thousands per Bitcoin. And that is conservative assuming you didn't hit the extremes on the high/low ends.
Lets look at Bitcoin over the last 24 hours:
 - Start at $17,000 at 3AM Eastern
 - Drop to $13,800 at 7AM Eastern (drop by $3900 in 4 hours)
 - Rise to $16,700 at 10AM Eastern (raise by $3900 in 3 hours)
 - Drop to $15,800 at 1PM Eastern (drop by $900 in 3 hours)
 - Rise to $16,500 at 7PM Eastern (raise by $700 in 6 hours)
 - Drop to below $16,000 as of this post at 3AM Eastern (drop by $500)
The end result is anyone that held their BTC lost $1000 per Bitcoin just today alone.
However if I took action on just one or two of these fluctuations alone, buying low and selling high, I would up thousands per Bitcoin. Let alone all the micro fluctuations I'm not including here.
I'm not arguing against a buy-and-hold approach or saying it's for everyone. But using a 3 year developed algorithm is much more profitable, and the algorithm knows when to go into hold mode. So saying a "hold" approach is simply not understanding modern AI algorithms, because they take that into consideration.

Participation is purely voluntary, not for the weak or faint of heart. If you view day-trading with a finely tuned bot as shady, you probably didn't buy into Bitcoin in 2013 due to the "shady" nature of the coin. It's the early adopters and those willing to take risk that reap the rewards. A lot of people took a loss today, while a finely oiled program can bring in huge gains instead, as the video clearly shows.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:47:55
Never heard back from you on my challenge I presented to you, going shy on me now? Your lack of enthusiasm for alternate approaches to trading is most disconcerting. Especially when I'm showing the results that prove you wrong. Opposite of good old Mr. Dimon, I would have fired you by now for NOT trading Bitcoin during in this market. 
Where is your ambition? I'm questioning your dedication to the cause.
Sorry bapey, you might want to look up your definition of a shill. Just because you lost the argument doesn't mean you can just start laying out accusations that aren't true. Maybe you need to watch the videos again but in slow motion?

Here you are - This is 24 hours of trading earlier in the day, and my last video: 
Even if you assume each buy and sell was just 1 BTC, you'll see the profit far exceeds $700. It takes some math, but the numbers are there!

You have shown your cards - My demonstrations are helping the investing public, but you are a clear outliner and have resulted to calling names in desperation. Why is that? Why not a healthy discussion? You aren't really for Bitcoin's succes, that much is obvious. Your arguments lack logic, and your insults lack merit. 
If my videos, examples, and demonstrations is not helping you understand - I don't have the time to explain it to you. However I think your lack of understanding is a ploy, you aren't for BTC success.

I don't think you understand - Having bias can only exist in opinions, there are no biased facts. What I presented was a clear example of over 50 successful trades in a very short time frame by showing the factual numbers. How many examples do you need? 
Here is another one for you. Does the example of about 100 successful trades in a 24 hour period help you see that there is no opinion to be biased here?

It doesn't matter if it's a bill, a physical gold ounce, a electronic Bitcoin - All are backed by perceived value. When the United States went off the gold standard we no longer required our money to be backed by gold. So now everything is worth what the market deems, including the dollar - It's relative value is constantly in flux regards to international currencies, for instance.
Regardless of it's existence or form, money being easily transmitted/transported and easily tracked is of primary importance. Digital assets (crypto-currency) resolves that problem.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:23:03
Let me try to explain further how trading is not "gambling". I know the market will move - We have considered that to be a given assumption. I've explained already how trading nets a profit if it moves up. Suppose we have the exact same scenario of Bitcoin starting at $15K and ending at $15K after 24 hours. However during this time the market dips by $500 to $14,500, before returning to $15,000. 
Again, the do-nothing "hold" strategy nets no gain in this 24 hour period. However the intelligent trader purchases at the drop of $14,500 and sells at the relative higher amount of $15,000. That nets $500 for every Bitcoin traded.
As you can see from my videos, my algorithm trades about 50 to 75 times a day. So every day you hold, I trade and increase both my Bitcoin and fiat balance. Bitcoin has historically been profitable to buy and hold, that is true. I'm simply explaining how there is much more profit to be had by a smarter approach.
That's as far as I'll go. If you don't understand AI based algorithm trading I don't have the time to explain it to you.
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:03:42
You have no basis to call it a shill or crappy, I've presented you evidence and now your just getting pissy. The proof is in the pudding - I'm trying to present you with clear evidence and show you there is a better way!
If you claim this is a shill, how about we wager a competition on my trading bot vs. your "hold" strategy? Pick any day you'd like in advance, and we'll see who commands higher profits. Surely you can pick a day that your strategy will work, right? I'll make my results public via a screenshare that night.
Sometimes it does take directed evidence to be convinced, let's give it a go!

If you consider self righteous putting out predictions that have always come through correct, then you are correct. BTC at $3500 for the win - Starting at 25% now cause it's goint to crash more, next target of $3K for even more of a BTC pickup!
@_date: 2018-11-25 03:21:00
That's why it's a phased approach, sure it go lower but we are hitting the waves as it sinks. It's reached a point where the upticks will present tangible opportunities to pick up any buys before another slide.
And remember...The btc we know now may not be the same "btc" blockchain come this time December...
@_date: 2018-03-20 05:10:34
So how did it go over the last few weeks? If you picked your points at about a 5% delta, you should have made a 50% profit by this point. Of course, you might not have been able to hit every point if it hit multiple times in quick succession while you were sleeping or at work. But the market volatility has been so extreme, bouncing from $7K to $11K and back to $7K and now well past $8K, it's hit the 5% delta so many times that a 50% profit has been achieved using the 5% delta strategy. Just hoping you kept your points and held them!
@_date: 2018-11-21 06:23:15
The simple fact that everyone is holding due to possible increase in value in the future, rather than fungability of the coin, shows the failures. The holders lower the circulating supply, increase volatility, and increase the ability of the exchanges to control the prices. It was meant to be used by Satoshi when it matured, and it has - Not horded for a future date to get richer.
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:51:17
Congrats for Nick and team for their first pickup buy/sell combo of bchsv - 5% gain already! Keep it up, ride all three coins, and you will be in for a great ride! Beware of btc and bchabc, both are still falling - So to reiterate, set your buy/sell deltas so you can cover a large spread when it does hit your target and keeps moving. Remember, we are looking to have already started trading by the time BTC reaches $3100, and is at a maximum volatility.
Don't get emotional! The market won't act as you predict! The only thing to do is be prepared and have the appropriate funds to continue trading and ride the waves.

@_date: 2018-11-20 02:55:32
I don't care about your opinion, all I'm doing is trying to save people money. That's what I did all year, if you read my earlier posts.
The facts are simple. Those that sold when I sounded the alarm can now triple their BTC, if they should so choose to buy back in. Those that traded as it went down made some amazing gains from the volatility. Those that held onto their coins with a do-nothing strategy helped the rest of the traders make more money and increased volatility by cutting the circulating supply.
Those are the facts. I've been telling people to sell or at least be active in riding market gains/losses. I posted evidence of making over 3% for 3 consecutive days. I gave a challenge to anyone to beat my trading platform, nobody did.
Glad you have chosen your side - Stick to it to the end.
@_date: 2018-03-02 20:31:27
Be careful, the algorithm is just part of it. Getting to tune all the variables to be effective is where the special sauce is. After all, with about 50 variables to change....How do you determine which is the best for the market at any given time? That is where extensive testing comes into play, we are talking tens of thousands spent running different numbers through Amazon's servers to get results.
Sometimes when it looks good on paper, it will test horribly. Other times it doesn't seem like a particular variable should be set so low or high, but it ends up performing very well.
Bottom line is a lot of people are getting burned by putting a bot into play but not knowing the best parameters. Just be sure to sandbox it first to ensure it will act as you expect, before making it live!
@_date: 2018-11-21 03:00:53
Wow - You have no idea how to ride the market do you? First of all - I can't predict which way it will move. Second, it doesn't matter if it goes down or up if you buy/sell at fixed deltas that prove well in testing, you'll still make more than doing nothing.
Playing the market isn't about trying to predict the swings, it's having funds available to buy/sell at any fixed point along the swings.
So you say I've been "guessing" for the past 10 months...Even though I've never been incorrect? Wrong guess.
@_date: 2018-11-24 15:55:24
Why should you be scared? This is simply a natural cycle that Bitcoin has done many times throughout it's life. The price has always rebounded - Are you saying this time it's going to break form?! Now that would be scary!
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:18:28
It's simple - Use a bot that you define with a group of programmers and tirelessly test on Amazon for every market period. Consider hundreds of variables, market indicators, Fibonacci sequences, social cues - Then cut out all the clutter until you have something reduced from a chaotic system to something you can capitalize on. 
You don't predict it, you just want it to move. You win if it goes down, and you win if it goes up. How you build the bot is up to you and how much money you have to test it on Amazon's servers...

@_date: 2018-11-21 03:07:17
If you read my full transactions since joining 10 months ago, you'll see I've never trolled. I've made some predictions public, but mostly helped argue against a pure holding strategy with Bitcoin. I've never been incorrect, and when I posted my public videos and challenged anyone to better results, nobody could come close.
Holding is simply not healthy for the coin, and definitely not for your wallet. Best to be treated as it was intended - Traded, used to buy and sell services, etc.....but not locked in cold storage.
@_date: 2018-11-18 21:50:27
Glad I could bring you a laugh - So many holders are crying right now that didn't sell at above $15K when it was crashing. Happy to bring you a much needed smile!
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:57:51
Yeah I feel great, I just made more easy money overnight. Poof, into my wallet! Partial thanks to you and the other holders for increasing volatility. I'm going to wait for it to sink even more before buying in and riding the waves.
@_date: 2018-11-23 19:01:44
I have not mentioned anything about a poster, yes indeed that is bizarre.
@_date: 2018-11-20 04:56:15
Unfortunately not yet, it's looking to take anywhere from 20% to 38% of the gains. Not all that bad - I think it's funny the Fed was auctioning tens of thousands of BTC a few years back, so I consider this mud in their face. Take my trimmings, I'll keep the meat!
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:09:38
I never told people to sell, I told them the bull run was over in December and to start thinking about actively trading. Get your facts straight, stop fabricating lies or you WILL be called out, and watch your language.
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:02:14
Let me try to explain it to you in a more basic manner.
My advice was to sell once it slid below $17K. Let's assume you waited a couple thousand and finally sold a single BTC at $15K. That means you have $15,000 to buy Bitcoin today at well below $4700, so you would have turned your single BTC into over 3 BTC.
By not taking action, you have an opportunity cost. You had the opportunity to increase your Bitcoin by over 300% by selling and re-buying, but did not. That is your opportunity cost.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:05:58
Just look at a graph of crypto over the last 2 months and you'll see it! Everyone that missed the boat before and couldn't afford to buy any significant amount, can start jumping on board now since it's done it's classic 50% dip.
@_date: 2018-02-26 17:16:53
If you are trading with tethers then you are not someone that will understand the complexities involved. I pay taxes on the 10k profit and the 1k profit since the profits made from day trading exceed a buy and hold strategy, so not sure on your point there.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:14:59
Alright we have hit the buy point, just letting you know I predict the market to recover now that it's dropped to $6100. Still giving you friendly advice, hope you take it!
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:14:43
Good guess, but no - I don't do any of the work and know nothing more than the next guy/gal. The trading platform is the brain, I just follow it's advice and pass it on to the deserving. You are the one creating the image of a "smug know-it-all" when all I've done is give my 2 cents on actively trading. I have my list of those that take advice and reap the rewards, and don't worry....You are crossed off! 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:11:30
I just checked all my threads, I never told anyone to sell. Fact checking is a bitch, huh!?!
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:50:42
I don't need anyone to validate our predictions, they are done by machine. I don't except any accolades for being correct all the time, why should I apologize if I was incorrect?
By the way, if you look at my history I haven't yet been incorrect in any predictions. It's unfortunate for you that I haven't been wrong once, so you don't have any basis on the conclusion I wouldn't apologize if I was ever wrong. Nice try.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:30:02
If you don't understand I don't have the time to explain it to you.
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:35:22
Now what kind of language is that to be using? And yes I did have cocks for breakfast, you got a problem with that?
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:07:51
I looked through your posts - What makes you think you are a big deal? Not that I don't believe you, I just don't see the evidence. But I'll take sound advice from anyone that is confident, so throw it out there for me like I have been for you!
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:16:29
You don't know what the hell you are talking about Holo - I told you it would sink to this low, and you insulted me for it. Seems that is all you are good at, telling people to f off. Enjoy being a sheep - Baaaaaah!
@_date: 2018-02-26 17:12:51
I don't have much money, sorry can't help there.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:14:56
Alright we have hit the buy point, just letting you know I predict the market to recover now that it's dropped to $6100. Still giving you friendly advice, hope you take it!
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:51:28
The dip? It hasn't happened yet brotha, stick around for $7K. It's still in the plunge.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:57:17
Wow - That makes no sense, you better revise and repost so it's readable.
Financial evolution is simply evolution on the level of money. Just like the evolution of life, those that don't adapt quickly to changing conditions see a huge decline...or worse, eradication.
I'm not following the rest of your rabble.... "I have no outed myself"? What do you mean? And yes I have much more than 1000 Bitcoin so it's not a fact. So you just proved my arguement and shot your logic down. Wow - Nice try though!
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:37:00
Got it. Thanks for the clarification and constructive input.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:32:15
I would love to hear of anyone that took my trading platform's advice and sold yesterday to buy back in this morning at a quick 10% gain.
@_date: 2018-02-26 17:12:35
You must not have looked at my videos - Come back with a response after you've seen the evidence.
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:38:13
And in the meantime I've met my mark at $3500 as predicted. As I said, those in it for both and truly understand the market will see it rise again just like you, only capitalize on it.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:41:16
Of course I don't know what you did with your coins, that is your business. And you probably didn't follow our advice so I know you didn't make out like a bandit there. I never claimed to know what you did, and I certainly don't want to know what your strategy is.
I hold no importance, it's the programmers that built the machine that calls the shots - I just relay it on to those deserving. The people I've helped have called it extremely generous, and it has helped a great number of people. Basic psychology shows that you seeing it as narcissistic is your anger. Giving advice is not narcissistic. Giving good advice that turns out correct is helpful. Sorry you don't see things that way, I feel for you!
@_date: 2018-02-26 17:21:52
Having a trading mentality doesn't mean I won't hold some assets for more than a year, it simply means I'll make more money trading in the swings than taking no action. I don't understand your logic of not taking action if it's profitable and results in paying taxes. So are you suggesting to not take the higher paying job/investment because of all the higher taxes you'll have to pay based on the increase in earnings? So why not work at McDonald's, so much simpler!
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:01:15
Lol - You obviously don't know who I am. I don't care about you, or how much you need my advice. I care about those that do need sound advice, and it's sorely lacking here. I've been doing this a lot longer than you have, I'm not a saviour - I'm just giving fair (and accurate) advice. Sorry that makes you so angry, but we find it very humorous that you think giving advice equates to being smug. You must not be able to take advice well, which doesn't say very good things about your character. Learn from others!
@_date: 2018-03-26 23:38:26
Yeah it was always cheaper than banks before being taken over by Axa last year. The fees will go back up, they cycle is well calculated and will continue to flux.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:05:00
Sure, I completely believe you 100%. And I have more money in copper than you will have in your entire life. Does that make me somehow better off? No. Logic fail. Oh, and the IRS is now looking at you for a huge tax check due in a couple months - You were just flagged. Nice work!
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:16:29
Oh, I get it - A joke! Hilarity. I'm not here to play games, but yeah that's pretty funny.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:39:09
Again, I won't stop giving financial advice to the public despite your efforts to silence me. I won't slander you with any unkind words as you continue to do, but you are completely incorrect - The public can and does care about this type of advice! You don't speak for the community, so go ahead and block me so I can continue helping people.
@_date: 2018-02-26 17:25:04
Already done, was easy since I've been filing since 2013 and my accountant back East is the best crypto accountant can buy. The rate of tax was far less than the profits made from day trading, so it was just like any good job/investment/stock etc - Positive returns and taxed on just a part of that return. And now I have more BTC than before, more fiat, and can keep holding as much as I want long term. But why would I do that when day trading is so much more profitable, turned out 230% more profitable.
Good luck for you as well!
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:19:36
Ah - Yes here we go, the full showing of your cards. Out come the dirty words, lowest common denominator! It's what kids do when they run out of logical arguments, start calling names - Classy!
You have no idea how much I have, so your comparisons are completely pointless and without merit. Plus equating financial gains to somehow being "better" than another person simply isn't a good way to go about life. Your fries are probably commonly dipped dipped with special sauce with that attitude. I'll gladly serve you up some!
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:15:05
It's all good - I don't mind being blocked by you. Those that know there is always something to be learned will always be open to advice. Negative karma on Reddit means nothing to me, there are so many false actors that constructive posts like mine will be shot down due to an alternative agenda by others. I only care about my Karma in real life with the people I'm helping.
And again, it's not me - I'm just relaying the advice given to me by my financial platform and programmers.
@_date: 2018-02-28 21:38:40
Agreed! But I put my time into programming the algorithm that makes the trades, and figuring out the best numbers for the hundreds of variables involved. I can't take the credit, it all goes to the coders and programmers that put in countless long nights and went through hard times for years until dialing the bot in and refining it to perfection....They are now reaping the rewards!
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:59:18
This looks like the future of Bitcoin Cash, isn't that their logo?
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:19:16
To be honest I didn't either, until our most recent run of calculations comparing to latest future numbers. Suddenly the market conditions were a lot different as far as expected behaviour....
But don't let the quick decline yesterday throw you, about 3/4 of all futures being sold are long and not short.
@_date: 2018-02-28 21:29:58
Yep - Since tax is a percentage of earnings it's just like earning more money at anything whether it be your job, in stocks, etc. If you earn more, you will be taxed more. Nothing wrong with being taxed more than the holders, because much more money is being earned.
@_date: 2018-02-28 21:35:13
Can't argue with you there. That is why I made this video proof to show that trading is not only possible but very, very profitable. Everyone has things wrong that believes trading is somehow a bad approach, and this is due to many false actors pounding this point for years. 
They have been convinced by others that they shouldn't be actively engaged with their Bitcoin. This results in increased market volatility that the holders can't take advantage of, while the traders enjoy the waves knowing holders won't help buffer the swings.
It's amazing how many holders are shooting themselves in the feet right now...

I am keeping it up, thank you for the permission. And again I hold no importance, I'm simply giving advice based on a very expensive and tightly held trading platform.
I think you have simply mistaken the need for a correlation between me being correct for a sense of self importance. Being confident in giving advice is a worthwhile trait. Me being correct has nothing to do with my worth or value over others, I find it of value to help others. So call it what you want...But your confusion runs deep in the lack of differentiation between being confident in predictions and being self-important. I don't want to even go there, you might want to see a shrink for that one.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:45:30
Pure chance that I have been correct in every single prediction? Well I'm glad you didn't take my advice yesterday and sell any, because you don't deserve the profits. Financial evolution demands you stay in class you deserve and have earned.
@_date: 2018-02-26 17:27:50
Agreed. Point taken. Just trying to shake some people out of their trance that the market has forced them into. I feel so increadibly sorry for those that are missing out on these swings around the $10K mark  by the fear that trading will cause a loss of BTC. It's, in fact, the opposite.
@_date: 2018-02-28 21:16:13
Holy hell man, hold down the anger. I'm not saying you should have sold, I'm simply saying you should trade based on market volatility and with the dip comes a great time to buy back in at a lower point. If you are upside down, don't sell at a loss, just re-buy in at the new low and ride the waves.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:24:07
Take heart in this - Futures are heavily bullish and a price recovery. They know something we don't. About 25% of futures are short, but the vast majority are long. Just be patient and don't watch the day-to-day activity to stay sane. It gets toxic and will change your life patterns, try to keep it on the sidelines of the brain.
@_date: 2018-11-18 21:55:39
I'm not talking about myself, I'm not a holder.
I never left. Oh, you are responding with nothing of value. K.
@_date: 2018-02-01 06:06:01
What's your point? You said "keep thinking you are a God", but now admit you trade like I encouraged. So why would you say I think I'm a God by trading, if you do it to? Do you think you are a God? I would never make such a claim.
Then you follow it up with the outrageous claim of "...selling this program so people can make billions of dollars like you?". If you did your research you would know it's under lock and key, I stated in December it's not for sale and never will be. Making the assumption I'm selling it is quite ludicrous, it's simply too advanced.
I know full well the range of risk adverse individuals to those that indulge in high risk investing, nothing new there.
I don't understand your previous aggression, seems like you are backtracking.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:41:10
Yep it's rinsing and repeating alright, just glad for those that freed up funds by selling high and now doubled their Bitcoin. That is how to make money in this game - Don't leave your wallet unattended, use it! Notice when the bull run is over, and waiting for a low to buy back in. So you are in agreement with me - Thanks!
@_date: 2018-02-28 21:39:15

So what advice have we given that you don't feel is worthwhile? If you would have taken our advice, you would have doubled your BTC by now. It was sound to everyone with a sane mind, so we can only conclude you are either a) delusional or b) a false actor. So which is it?
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:45:15
How is being correct, and making a logic arguement that turned out correct, being a fucking clown? You must be in a sad state of affairs right now my friend, I'm sorry for you.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:08:25
You can't force me to stop talking to you, it's called freedom of speech. All you have to do is turn the channel buddy.
Watch the language please, not all of the people I'm offering advice to are of age.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:42:57
So how did the last 24 hours treat you, did you take any of my logical advice and sell above $10K or did you just lose thousands? It's called being an intelligent investor, not a God. If you think intelligent investors are Gods, you would be on your knees worshiping everyone in my line of work.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:06:15
I stand corrected, you are right - The backlog was in fact eliminated. Ditto on the Bitpay business model, I'm working with many businesses that are losing money with them and switching to an alternate.
@_date: 2018-02-28 21:27:24
Yes one individual can't predict the market, but don't you think that the big players have algorithms that perform automated actions based on market conditions? I know for a fact they do, and they are well refined at this point. My bot was built in 2013 and has been refined over the last 4 years - It takes all executed buys and sells from 6 exchanges into account, percentages of short vs. long futures every 2 hours, delta of BTC price compared to other currencies for possible arbitrage, rate of spot change, etc etc. Hundreds of factors are taken into account for each buy and sell placed - No single person can calculate everything quickly enough.
Yes this bot has made people tons of money, and their clients tons of money. If you watch the videos, you'll see that tens of thousands was made in 72 hours just for the one time demonstration. We challenged anyone to beat our results, and none could.

No, look at their prices - Right there on the website, paying with Bitcoin is over a $10 fee above cash. Just another Bitcoin fail with merchants, they are racking up.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:52:37
I hope you followed my advice and held off? Like I've been saying for months, it's drop below $7K was statistically probable and well predicted with almost every big-house financial model.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:03:23
My helping of individuals does nothing for my ego, I consider it my duty. I'm simply taking note of all the irrational actors here that see advice and observations as something "ill" or wrong. It's great to know the rational everyone gives for attacking an individual that is offering sound advice. Your rational for attack is that I'm stroking my ego, when my identity is anonymous. That makes no sense.
Why would you say me helping people makes me mentally ill? It's you who is calling names, shooting down constructive criticism, and stinking it up. I've always been here, and it didn't stink 5 years ago. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:55:08
Congratulations to everyone that held off, I hope there are others out there besides those I've been chatting with directly that held this advice in mind. As I said, the drop to $7K was well predicted - Now we are in no-mans land with new predictions coming out widley different depending on the model / business. Now is a good time to buy, and actively buy/sell that in the chaos. Take advantage of this great timing and buy below $6500!
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:44:06
You called it, I missed the step to below $9K that happened today. Don't worry, the slide will continue and hit the other stops!
@_date: 2018-02-26 17:14:54
I don't think you understand the purpose of day trading, it's to beat the holders in both short and long term. Currently the algorithm is trading at over a 230% above a buy-and-hold strategy.
What makes you think buying and selling crypto is reason for me not "really believing" in it?
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:36:31
Do you see the truth in my words now, or still think I'm a troll? This isn't about being smug - It's about being smart and trying to save the community. I stated the bull market was over at $19K in December. I stated you should start thinking of trading rather than buy-and-hold. If you don't want to take my advice, then join the herd. But my "trolling" as you have called it has saved people hundreds of thousands already with it's sound advice. Sorry you aren't one of them!
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:10:39
Please define where I created any Fear, uncertainty or doubt. I'm saying this drop is a good thing so people can buy back in. You can stop listening, but I will continue to offer my advice. Which, has proven very historically accurate. Are you mistaking fud for giving advice?
@_date: 2018-02-26 17:18:23
Already done, wasn't bad at all. I would pay higher taxes from l much larger income, than pay lower taxes from a investment strategy that doesn't perform as well.
