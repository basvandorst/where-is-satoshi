Not really... What about the politicians obviously getting a lot of donations from one group, and then help that group? Or they go to a lot of the same fund-raisers, or they give a lot of good publicity the that politician? The politicians always return the favour. 
It happens a lot, to say "politicians don't care where there money comes from" is just ignorant.

I wanted to buy Bitcoins recently and I was told by people to buy from MTGox. I'm really glad that I didn't and that I bought from somewhere else now.

Franc is a currency
Frank is a name
Frankfurter is a food. (generally shortened to "Frank")
Currencies that sound like names can work.

Actually that is an interesting idea. A lot of people will potentially buy Bitcoins purely to buy games on steam. They buy $50 worth of Bitcoins in Jan 2015, in Feb they are now worth $75 but in March they are worth $30 and that's when the AAA game they wanted to buy comes out! (Which usually cost $49.95) How do you think that person will feel? Not just about that situation but about Bitcoin in general.

True, but think about it this way.
The people buying new iPhones sell their old ones to help finance buying the new one. People buying old, second hand ones therefor are still part of the chain of buying brand new ones.
Then there is the 'omni-present' feeling of Apple products. if people are seeing Apple products everywhere, seeing friends using them, colleagues etc. then eventually non-Apple users think "I might as well get one/try it out"
But I don't think the main goal of this was to get people to move away from Apple products. I think the main thing to come from this was awareness of the fact Apple is anti-Bitcoin. I'm willing to bet a lot of people who support Bitcoin didn't know about it before this (and might have glossed over that fact still because they focused on the wrong part of the it as a whole)

Why not both though? The newbies first port of call will always be because it just makes sense to check the bitcoin subreddit for information. It also helps newbies who want to learn more to see vets talking about the more indepth stuff because then they can see more that bitcoin has to offer.
However, the idea of a subreddit purely for people who want nothing to do with newbies makes sense if people want to do that (but they shouldn't feel like they have to be sequestered there)

"This dollar is just one dollar but if we can find the bitcoins in here we'll be RICH!"

Any new bitcoin business helps bitcoin. Remember, there are some people who are only buying things with bitcoin now and accepting it would set you apart from other online jewelry stores.

I think it's about time I bought some bitcoins just so I can finally buy some gold myself!

Valve have to split the revenue with developers. It's very easy to say "This game sold for $50, minus transaction fees, we split what is left X/Y" with fiat however with bitcoin... not all developers want it. Most developers don't. So that will leave Valve with a pile of Bitcoins dipping into the cash reserves to pay out developers for their share of sales. Then what are Valve supposed to do with their bitcoins? Horde them? I don't think there is much you can buy with bitcoin that they would be interested in (as a major business... I could be wrong) but the most likely scenario is they will be dumping a lot A LOT of bitcoins for sale regularly which will be lowering the price.

Every day a new article about Gox comes out more people either sell their BTC or avoid buying. So the sooner it's over the better I think.

I'm willing to bet the people replying to emails aren't the people who make any decisions or know about any decisions being made.

Selling it for cheap just encourages somebody else to stay part of Apple. Whoever buys the phone hasn't heard about the Bitcoin protest/doesn't care about it. 
Every working product in circulation is also a walking advertisement for the brand.

There was thanks but they weren't allowed to say anything at the Olympics/at a lot of locations. The Olympics is very anti-sponsorship and if they were allowed to say "Thank you Dogecoin for sending us to the Olympics!" then they might have gotten kicked out. If an exception was made other teams could eventually say "Thank you Nike for sending us to the Olympics" and eventually the Olympics would become covered in promotional material.

Dogecoin doesn't have abuse for people who are new and want to learn, neither does a lot of altcoins or other things.
If somebody wants to check something out and they get abused on entry, chances are they will dump it rather than check it out.

The problem is I bought in RIGHT before the dip happened.
It would have been good if I bought now (or actually, it would have been good if I bought 3 hours after I actually bought, because that was when it got down to 709 AU).

Me too... Kept clicking it watching it re-size thinking I'd missed. Took me 4 clicks.
