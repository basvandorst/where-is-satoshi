VisaNet performs 56,000 transactions per second, while BTC is currently ~4. For BTC to scale via increasing the block size a single 10 minute block that would require 14GB (17.2GB if you implement via block size doubling).
Clearly seeing this even the most stubborn baboon would admit increasing the block size is not a good scaling solution. I don't think non-commercial agent would pay $45 + labor every 1 hour 40 mins to support the network.
Of course mimblewimble is a solution to block chain scaling, but that's a fundamental change to BTC so an entirely different conversation.

Because then the blockchain database size will quickly grow to unmanageable levels for regular people. Then institutional and virtual nodes will become the dominant verification method of blocks and rewards, which will essentially be the centralization of Bitcoin.
While it makes sense as a quick "temporary" fix, once you implement and release it to live there isn't really much chance of going back.
The main reason the mempool backlog is so large is that miners and larger pools are spamming the network and recollecting their fees; as that way they force users to up their fees in order to get transactions through and thus increasing profits. This issue will solve itself once competition in the mining space comes about due to natural market forces; and should BTC ever be threatened seriously by the mempool issues, you will see them clear up very quickly.

The primary reason the mempool is full is due to miners spamming the network, S2X would stem the issue by making it unprofitable to continue doing it unless they force fees even higher and also increase throughput. However the main issues being with the roll-out, backward compatibility, and then finally deprecation.
If S2X was a supported solution by the core devs and not a hard fork then I would support it too, as the main drawbacks would have been assessed and have contingencies in place; please remember S2X is a splinter group interested in centralization of the BTC nodes in the long term. The splinter group has already proven their incompetence once before and cost a lot of people money.
As a personal rule of thumb I support the BTC core development team decisions; while I do not always agree with them initially, by discussing it and weighing the solutions from different perspectives I've leaned that these guys know what they are doing to a much higher level than the standard development team.

Then they will go bankrupt fairly quickly.
Their entire business model is based on creating a risk-free trading platform for traders (who pay for the privilage and how they make their profits). If all traders make shorts on BTC then CME will need to sell some BTC assets to cover eventuality that BTC does go down; and likewise if all traders bet BTC goes up, then CME will need to buy BTC to gain the money to pay the traders.
CME manage the risk of investing, the only way to do that is to be an active trader of the commodity, much like a bookie but on a more grandiose scale. CME isn't just a bottomless pot of money that endlessly pays out for traders, they need to make money too.

No, the nodes have a full copy of the ledger so that they can verify that the miners have done there job correctly.
If the nodes say no to a new block provided by the miners then it never gets to enter the block chain and the miners lose all the work they put into hashing and so lose money. This is the essence of proof-of-work.
It is essential that nodes remain distributed as that is where the controlling power rests (with everyone), mining was always destined to become centralized. Any changes to node operations should be treated with high skepticism as if they become compromised then all your BTC holdings will become worthless.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:41:57
Except the CME will be buying and selling BTC based on demand from their clients in order to mitigate their own risk. Otherwise they will go bankrupt fairly quickly.
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:07:35
If all miners collectively agree and all nodes reject their work then there is a stalemate and the BTC network will stall until one group changes their minds.
It would be infeasible for all miners to coordinate in this way, as in terms of game theory the system state is not a Nash Equilibrium. Therefore each single miner would have incentive to change their strategy and submit something the nodes would accept to receive increased reward.
In contrast over 50% of nodes would need to agree to change strategy for miners to win, and if they do that then all players would lose out due to the decrease in value of BTC through deflation and loss of trust.
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:59:48
Miners verify transactions and collect a block, then sign it with a hash, this signing requires a lot of work, Miners then send it out to nodes.
Nodes receive the block and verify the block is correct, verification requires 1 hash attempt to ensure the PoW, a check that block rewards are correct, and then an iterative check though the local chain that there are no double spends. If the nodes are happy it forwards it on to other nodes via babble (like a torrent); if not, due to either the hash function being incorrect, a double spend, or an incorrect transaction then they ignore it.
Once enough nodes have accepted a block then consensus is reached and it will be built upon with future blocks. Mining rewards are locked for 100 blocks; so that also reduces miner incentives for abusing the system and sneaking one passed not only nodes, but other miners. Assuming nodes are not lazy (not validating blocks) and are decentralized (independently incentivized) then there is very little risk of consensus being reached with bad blocks.
The purpose of the proof of work is to reduce the rate at which blocks can be produced, as checking all transactions are correct can be a bit of effort for nodes and owuld spam the network with too much traffic. As it costs $10,000 of work to submit a block and no effort to check that work took place, so you can be 99.9999% sure it won't be spammed out with fraudulent transactions; the further checks just ensure that the other 0.0001% is also not fraudulent.

As it stands there's no reason to punish them:
* short term, they get negative PR and profit
* medium term, they invite competing companies with deep pockets to invest into the mining space
* long term, lightning network and other upgrades will limit the fees
Using some more advanced algorithms you can do away with miners all together with a system of just nodes and users. Some people of have tried to do this with some alt-coins already with varying success, but essentially the algorithm runs by having nodes verify each others transactions and then staking their own coins to back the transaction should they be wrong (proof of stake).

It's possible, but there would be no point in doing so. All that would happen is eventually everyone will have their wallets just like normal, except miners would have 10,000,000 more than had on the core chain. You could achieve the same thing by just manually awarding them it as a new block reward. That would be more efficient.
Ultimately you wouldn't be able to convince the community to move to the new chain, as it wouldn't have support of developers, exchanges, nodes, or other actors. No miners would jump on board as the the value of the coin would deflate to nothing as there is no limited supply, which would lead to other actors to rejecting it. Bitcoin core value would continue to inflate, which would draw miners back quickly to make profits.
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:58:50
That sounds like a mirror of how the USA went from a gold backed currency to a fiat one; essentially stealing all value from their citizens. What happens when history attempts to repeat itself and the group of core engineers tries to turn Bitcoin into a depreciating asset by releasing more and more coins?
I thought the whole point of Bitcoin was it was not a deflationary store of value, and mathematically secured in such a way as to prevent deflationary tactics. Surely the fact that the total supply cap is not immutable means that the value of all bitcoins is not secure since it should roughly relate to "market cap" / "total supply".
So in reality the Bitcoin protocol is just a trusted store rather than an immutable store; which is the same proposition as banks just cheaper to use and more expensive to run?

@_date: 2017-11-16 01:28:28
Bitcoin offers a very steady value increase and a decent volatility to rake in extra profit and increase your stake. So for now that BTC offers more security than the alts for value increases.
It also takes a lot of research to day trade successfully; and also quite a bit  just to protect your long term stake in BTC (like from the recent dip). It's easy to miss easily predicted stuff if your research is spread out over too many fields; so sticking to just BTC or one other is a bit easier then spreading across lots of alts.
At least that's how I feel at the moment.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:05:56
Everything is relative. The USD, EURO, YEN and other fiat prices for Bitcoin are simply a measure of how much Bitcoin is becoming disconnected from them.
If you look at it from another perspective and compare the amount of Bitcoin you can buy with a USD you can clearly see it's buying power crashing exponentially. 
Eventually that buying power will be 0 as not only will Bitcoin usability and practicality be going up, but the deflationary nature of USD will force it into an early grave.

@_date: 2017-11-13 17:19:43
The only way you can validate transactions is by ensuring no one is spending money they don't have.; and the way the block chain stores transactions requires you to know the full history (entire database) so you know how much bitcoin is in every account you need to check. 
The transactions are stored like below:
* mining rewards go to address A
* mining fees goes to address B to A
* transaction amount goes from address B to C
@_date: 2019-02-08 02:52:30
No, but malicious actors could always spam the mempool with high fee transactions; making regular transactions prohibitive. It wouldn't stop the lightning network though \^\^
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:39:29
Doesn't the fact the segwit update removed transactions signatures mean that BTC now has to now constantly battle against the forks in terms of replay attacks? 
This coupled with the lack of EDA (emergency difficulty adjustment) protection, means a large group of miners can force BTC into a death cycle by pumping up hashing difficulty then jumping ship to a forked coin.
Seems like just increasing the block size would resolve that issue without undue risk and it's not like memory space is at a premium. Also if BTC wants to become a VISA replacement in the future then there will need to be an increase in block size anyway. There's no way the amount hashing power would increase enough to handle the number of blocks needed, whereas memory storage would.
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:00:12




@_date: 2017-11-14 00:02:53
It doesn't need to be 100% local, but the bitcoin protocol is keeping it simpler and more robust than some of the newer crypto technologies, at the expense of some memory storage.
The entire database is locally stored on nodes so that each individual node can check the entire history of an address (to ensure it has sufficient funds) without having to rely on 3rd parties.
If instead you were to only store a particular sequence of blocks, then it would take much longer for a network to search through and validate transactions due to the inherent latency in coming to consensus. It would also introduce vulnerabilities into the network as one could take the entire network down by DDOSing the nodes containing the most vulnerable block (one with the least number of copies).
I imagine pruning is just removing invalid or null transactions from the mem-pool prior to processing a block, but I may be wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:39:43
There is nothing hypothetical about a flaw in the system (at least in the way that it has been advertised). It sounds like you agree Bitcoin is a flawed way to store value, but a good way to transfer value.

With an institutional middleman acting as the gateway node between Starbucks and their customers. There are several institutions that would gladly accumulate the bitcoin fees to both facilitate the increase in BTC value, while also acting as a central payment node on the lightning network.
They would quickly expand their offering to partial salary payments to balance their nodes, and to enable BTC payments for other services. In order for a stable business model they would just need enough bitcoin in reserve and the ability to short the market; this way they can have a stable business model that generates a lots of revenue regardless of market conditions.
No reason to touch fiat at all, you would only use it for reference at the to calculate the BTC price at the time of transaction

Could it be more the MTGox wallets and other large wallets are monitored by trade bots.

Conversion requires no fee, you simply calculate the bitcoin price at the time of purchase (i.e. when you buy your coffee). Bank wires at not needed, as you are simply facilitating payments from active bitcoin users. The only fees that would be involved would be a single on-chain transaction to setup your payment channel with the middleman node.

No need to insult, when I'm quite clearly explaining the rationale behind what Starbucks is considering.
1. For a start profit would not be 80% down, when crypto payments would consist of \~0.001% of their payments initially, which also have lower overhead than normal USD payments.
2. Second by accepting crypto payments their share value would increase significantly, just like all other companies that have declared they are entering the crypto-space. 
3. Thirdly Starbucks does not offer 100% of profits gathered as dividends to shareholders, most of it goes into pot, which  they do nothing with, in-case they need to buy a company or react to market conditions. Shareholder dividends would not be affected.
4. Finally, the value of bitcoin would increase significantly if adoption by Starbucks and others would occur; so anything they have in reserve would increase in value, rather than depreciate like the USD they would've potentially had instead.
If you're not getting it then just sell your crypto now and FOMO in later... it will increase my profits

I have family working over there at the moment (British ex-pats).
Since the government introduced some laws allowing taxes to be paid in cryptocurrencies, their employer has changed the salary scheme so that salaries are paid in bitcoin rather than Bolivar (before it was part USD part Bs). This is all done via local bitcoin, where they've been given instructions on how to set up an account and manage payments.
They also get their pension paid in Petro, but it's very complicated to use, and requires heavy bank involvement to do anything with it.
The richer Venezuelans are stockpiling Bitcoin, as they can transport it out of the country very easily; this is introducing more Bitcoin real-world commerce for luxury goods. I've been told by family you can buy property, rum, chocolates, and food with it over there.
It's looking very positive in terms of Bitcoin adoption; especially as it is supported by the Government (in part to bypass trade tariffs).

It will be on Ethereum network as an ERC20 token, so ownership and trade of these "stocks" will be highly fungible and public.
The reason why this is so great is that the way dividends are paid out by the company buying tokens from the market and destroying them; and the only way to publically exchange ERC20 tokens is via crypto-only exchanges.
This means that there will be a constant real world transfer of wealth into the cryptomarkets on a regular basis. The more asset tokens come about the more value crypto will gain overall.
Also Bitcoin is the fiat gatekeeper, so anyone wanting to pump money into ERC20 tokens has to first go through BTC as the exchange medium. Then supply and demand will force the price up.

No, Starbucks won't be receiving USD, but they will be receiving BTC.
They don't live paycheck to paycheck, so why would they convert to USD? They operate on a high profit margin and the BTC payments would be a tiny fraction of their income so all they would be really doing is converting some of their hoarded wealth into an asset that doesn't depreciate. It also has the benefit of reducing operational costs; and  as an early adopter they would also see a massive rise in their stored value.
Imagine if a company like apple with their $500 Billion of stored USD, which they don't know what to do with, start accepting BTC and hoard that instead. At the very least it would save then $15 Billion in inflation costs per year, and at best increase their hoarded value exponentially.

I just checked with my mother-in-law who is based in Caracas; she says that local-bitcoin still works fine over there. She confirmed that her and colleagues were able to use it fine yesterday.
They don't have a VPN setup.

There's in incentive to shut it down beyond them promoting Petro. 
Most goods selling and trades are done via local-bitcoin exchange; and they have just introduced a law requiring people to pay VAT / employment taxes in the same crypto they were paid in.
There's no incentive as they were actively collecting crypto that people see as valuable.

I suppose you could have your wealth stored in a "trust fund" smart contract.
It would have a feature to add owner inheritance to it in form of a tree, these would just be wallet addresses. Then if the current "owner" of the wallet has not made a payment in the last 6 months then it assumes the owner is dead and the inheritance pot moves down the tree to all their child nodes. 
The check should probably be in the form of a request by one of the child nodes, so that there is traceability and accountability if someone tries to screw over the owner. The owner could then just remove them from inheritance, or even adjust the amount of money they can receive.
You could also build in a system to traverse back up the tree if the owners wallet starts making payments again, in case someone has been incapacitated for a period of time (coma or prison). And another protective feature would be to drip feed access to the funds like a salary to child nodes, once the request is made and is valid.

Well, it's not like there's a secret hoard of food somewhere. There literally isn't enough food to go around so due to high demand the food prices have soared; for example half a dozen eggs is a typical weeks salary.
A normal salary for a maid would be equivalent to 1 slice of bread a day, and you would have queues of people applying. The advantage of being an expat is that you have access to foreign currency and embassies, which have their own food supply channels.

I know the subject is still up for debate, but I don't believe LN actually requires KYC.
The intermediary nodes for a routed payment don't ever hold 3rd party value as the transaction itself is atomic. They are just used to prove that a payment route is possible through the network without double spends and in a trustless manner.
KYC is applicable in situations where a middleman holds funds as an intermediary between two parties to assist a transaction (or for storage). For the LN this isn't the case as there is never a moment in time where a middleman ever holds one of the parties funds.

Why would you trust a group of people when you can trust a math, science, and technology instead?
For those that aren't up to speed on the crypto-revolution yet, while people are needed to initially create a distributed system, they are not required to continually run it like a traditional company.
Once a cryptocurrency and system is built, anyone can invest in it by simply acquiring the tokens; there's no actual need to take risky investments on systems that aren't created yet.
Conversely a human operated system like say Walmart is subject to corruption, incompetence, and inefficiency; and would require constant trust and vigilance to fight against it.
Why would anyone take the risk? Especially when you get a feel for the corporate environment and how it is actually run.

They need to pull over a billion dollars from the market to prove they are solvent and they have been doing it since early December when they first received the subpoena.
This is the major reason for the bear market currently, it's just the massive sell pressure from them converting from crypto to USD.

For example, there is a distributed version of Uber, which is immutable and uses a crypto token.
It is a real world service which directly competes with a centralised service run by people, only it's cheaper, faster, more secure, and much easier to invest in.
Both serve the same purpose, but which do you think is a better bet?

This size of 95% of the transactions pushing the value up 100's of Euros seem to be very small (less than 0.1 BC). And the majority of the safety net and points of resistance seem to be shifting upwards with it. Could this mean the value it's being artificially inflated to some extent?

If hashrate is increasing at this rate then it really wasn't as secure as we thought before.
As the hashrate as increased several 100% rather quickly, it implies that the previous hash rate was susceptible to 51% attack.
For those that are downvoting please go read some books, it obvious this hash power is coming from 2-3 manufacturers rather than 100s. If those few manufacturers could produce this large a percentage boost in hashpower then a 51% is not off the cards for them.

Nothing, you will never hold 3rd party funds in your payment channel.
Lightning transactions are atomic, which means they can't be broken down into the individual hops across the network and the whole payment chain is executed in one single event.

Gold price would surge because the price is heavily suppressed. There's 5 x 10 more gold in storage then there is in reality.
With Bitcoin it may be the case, but I find it unlikely; the main reason banks can get away with it for gold, is that there's a lot of security, maintenance, and transport costs involved for gold, which disincentivizes holders. There isn't this issue with bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-06 21:54:00
It doesn't actually go against the original idea of bitcoin. Bitcoin just enables a fair reveal when all the cards are laid out; currently when the banks see they are holding a losing hand they will just draw until they win.
Bitcoin is just a settlement layer (albeit an ideal one), and it has always been this way; that's all that the financial system needs currently to fairly represent value for the people.
@_date: 2019-09-12 13:53:32
If security comes from the scarcity of hashrate; but bitcoin hashrate is capable of increasing 200-400% in 6 months; then clearly the hashrate isn't scarse and the security is only being maintained by the cost relative to the reversable transaction value.
You should be concerned about where this extra hashrate capacity is coming from, and how the increase is possible.
There were a incredibly large transactions and some scheduled to come soon that would be profitable to reverse via a Sybil attack.

The thing about Venezuela is that the population has a very low education level; they believe that Maduro is being advised by the ghost of Chaves...
They have no clue on how to deal with the situation as they don't have much educational resource on political history, and they simply don't have the social infrastructure to form any kind of Coop attempt.
They are just desperate people who are totally reliant on the state; they still believe the government can help them out of this situation. The ones that complain and will act, just think that filling buckets with human waste and throwing it at the police/military will make a difference.

How about utility cryptosystems, where the tokens are rewarded to resource contributors by resource consumers (like in filecoin).
Lightning network will allow people to gain access and use  these systems by paying with Bitcoin (avoiding exchanges to buy filecoins) and also allow people to cash out of them easily too.

Or how about multiple store of value alternatives to BTC that uses a variety of different algorithms.
It would allow people to hedge their bets against BTC in case a serious vulnerability is discovered in the underlying algorithms; and make the cryptomarkets more robust.
@_date: 2018-04-06 02:29:37
I just explained the use case for other store of value currencies... as a hedge against the Bitcoin algorithms being found insecure, and to make an individuals portfolio more robust.
Lightning Network allows transactions between different coins so that counters the mechanisms that would promote a natural monopoly.

Yes, but as they aren't buying any BTC or selling BTC they don't affect the market. What affects the market is them buying 1000 BTC worth of shorts, then actually buying 100 BTC only to sell them at a loss, making a profit through manipulation.
Ultimately this is an unsustainable practice, as the money to pay the profits is coming from somewhere... when that money stops being the weak-handed people and becomes the company offering the futures, the price will skyrocket as that company will own such a large stake in bitcoin by that point from the slow accumulation they could the supply massively, while going on a big marketing spree.

Unfortunately the gold market has an almost infinite supply due to the flooding of gold certificates, which are neither audited nor fully backed by gold deposits. By holding these certificates or storing gold privately with the bank you need to pay storage and maintenance costs.

I'm not sure what you mean by "delegitimize"; an investment is an investment regardless of what others think.
The way the market is currently working:
1. The price is going down, because people are buying and then selling at a loss.
2. People do this to make a profit using cash settled futures.
3. The company offering futures is accumulating the base asset at a massive discount (through the mechanisms it uses to run the futures).
4. When the company offering futures decides they have enough of the base asset, they stop selling it.
5. Supply becomes an issue, price goes up.
The whole thing is essentially a scam to force the price down so they can buy it cheaply. We will only get from phase 3 to 4 when weak-hands stop selling, this will speed up the rate of accumulation of what's available. When that happens though expect to see the price go down hard, as a final shakedown.
You can't beat these guys as they have too much resource, so just join their strategy... cost-average your way in, and be grateful for the opportunity to buy this so cheaply.

That's not what's happening...
You can't create "new" bitcoin, beyond the 21 million designated for block rewards without consensus from all the BTC nodes (or 50+% to do this via a contentious hard fork).
I'm not sure what you read or where, but they may have been talking about them creating financial derivatives (bets on the price of an asset) for bitcoin, on which they were trading these "bets" without ever needing to touch the underlying asset. Then by the method I described above: acquiring the short bets; buying BTC at auction or OTC; selling it at a loss on the markets to tank the price; and finally collecting the wins on the bets.
@_date: 2018-12-15 16:59:46
Price is only an important metric when you sell. So if you're not looking to sell anytime soon, then the only people who should care about the price volatility are day traders and people who are about to be bankrupted.
I personally don't care about ETFs, BAAKT, or Futures; I will be holding and accumulating this asset; with the expectation that Bitcoin will develop the ability to transfer wallet "ownership" (the ability to sign wallet transactions) to other wallets as either a side-chain or a 2nd layer solution with smart contracts.
That will be when we will see the most insane adoption rate you could imagine, with almost every industry jumping in to make the dotcom boom look like a firecracker.
