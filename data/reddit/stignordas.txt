Update: Secret entry for Reddit users who don't care for Facebook:
We still need an email address to notify winners.
Thanks everyone and good luck!

Thanks, I can assure you there's no scam involved here. 
Just need a way to notify the winner. 
Thanks and good luck!

I'll see if I can convince the folks to offer a version that doesn't require 'liking' the fb page.

I love the concept, right now it'd probably be something I'd buy as a test.

 If you're linking to a bank account to fund Dwolla, wouldn't LE have the means to discover true identity already? Adding this info is just duplication isn't it?
However I think it's far too onerous on the user's end and smells like marketing thrown in with verification.

I did a transfer from my blockchain wallet 6 hours ago and it's still showing unconfirmed. I get the error "Error getting wallet balance"

I did a small purchase last week to try it out. I think they have a good site experience and they came through, even though the value rose. I hope they get it sorted out.

Man, it started out so good when you could just go straight from Dwolla to Mtgox without any kind of verification or fees. Shit's getting tight.
