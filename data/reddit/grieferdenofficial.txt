The block chain is an ingenius idea. Sadly most people who watch mainstream news only view the entire thing as "lol its just electricity". Even if Bitcoin does turn out to be a bubble. Block chain technology will live on and will create the framework for Web 3.0

He invested in it along time ago, and for the most part it went badly as IBM was not doing really well, he did make alot of money now but it deterred him from investing into tech firms.

First of all they cant own your assets. It is simply impossible. Unless you have more computing power than the entire network combined (even then you would only have a 50% chance of solving the block). They can buy bitcoin as much as they want but they cant steal it from you. I don't see a problem in that. If they were the only ones who owned Bitcoin the demand would diminish. This is a strawman scenario. You clearly don't understand how cryptocurrencies work and you just scream "omg big bad corporations gonna own us" every time you hear the word decentralized. If anything Bitcoin is showing that Anarcho-Capitalism is feasible on the internet because of block chain technology.

Under this logic the first plane was "failed experiment" , the first car was a "failed experiment". It started blockchain 1.0 a technology which was improved upon and is going to change the internet. It succeeded as an experiment. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:30:44
Bitcoin started it all, it probably won't fit into the future. Satoshi Nakamoto created blockchain 1.0 and its been improved upon. The block chain technology itself will revolutionize thr web. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:32:52


Any evidence of this? You're just describing the worst case scenario. Not to mention that the media who pump out anti-crypto garbage don't have a large viewer base of people who own bitcoin. All the issues you described are the same with any stock or asset. This isn't specific to crypto. The currency is extremely volatile and most of these "big corporations" still deem it as a large risk. Not to mention the bureaucracy inside these companies would make it impossible for them to raise such a large sum of cash just to attempt to make the market fall. This is pure conspiracy. Might aswell add Illuminati into the mix/s

Yeah giving the government money doesn't work. The bigger the government the more corrupt it is.

The website has an Aventador SV roadster for over 48 bitcoin. The most expensive car you can buy with crypto currency, a yellow SV roadster. 
EDIT: Someone just bought a  Bugatti Chiron and a Pagani Huayra using bitcoin from the same dealer. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:46:05
It's not a flawed system you moron, your lack of knowledge in crypto makes me think you're a troll who's lying. 
You are the perfect personification of r/topmindsofreddit 
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:32:53
How is it a failed experiment? It started the blockchain and just because there are better versions does not mean it failed. It was a successful experiment. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:17:29
Your account has negative karma, you never elaborate on your points and just call everyone "cucks". Clearly a troll.
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:11:32
This is a complete strawman. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:30:13
Bitcoin probably wont be the Crypto Currency used in the near future on mass. Newer coins such as Ethereum, NEO and all the coins which are going to be linked to Blockchain 3.0, Bitcoin for what it was, did alot to revolutionize the blockchain. But its currently becoming outdated. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:47:10
It's not if you understand cryptocurrency and the technology behind it. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 06:38:15
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:54:38


Thats because of the caste system. It locks people in poverty. The only thing the government should do is secularize. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:21:24
The bigger crypto gets the lower possibility of this happening. They can't control the block chain and it would cost too much money to "tank" crypto. So no, this will probably never happen unless you have hundreds of billions of dollars, more power than all of Ireland and more computing power than the entire world combined. Bitcoin isn't going to be  for long, the blockchain is outdated. Ethereum, Neo and other cryptos will overtake it. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:24:04
You're honestly the dumbest person I ever argued with, first of all this is not related to crypto. You accuse me of things you cannot prove. Clearly facts hurt your feelings. The fact that you use emojis and the word cuck, make me think you're a edgy 12 year old. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:58:52
They really don't, there are so many big players in the crypto business thats impossible for them to coordinate. Unless you have over 600 billion dollars just lying around. Most people interested in crypto don't believe the nonsense which the statist news networks say about Bitcoin. Its also not wise to have all your money in just one crypto, I don't care because most of the money I invested into crypto isn't even bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:59:10


This cannot be further from the truth. You said it was a failed experiment which it was not, you fail to understand my point. Bitcoin started blockchain technology and of course it has been improved upon, just like the original iphone. Currently Bitcoin is still the biggest, most popular and one of the most used crypto currencies. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:37:21
Nice strawman. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:13:57


Who said that? Can't find the original comment.
@_date: 2018-01-13 14:58:20
What? You're shitty rant about Anarcho Capitalism is hilarious. You don't have a clue how the blockchain works. Go cry about the big corporations in r/Socialism. You have no idea what Anarcho Capitalism even is. Just a typical reddit socialist. Dumb as a rock and angrier than a child. 
How is my language and grammar childish? Your shitty arguments just prove how idiotic you really are. You did not make a single argument which was related to Bitcoin or the Blockchain. Just shitty Ad Hominems and false claims wrapped together. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:37:00
There are plenty of critiques made by people who put the effort into their arguments and actually learned how the entire system works. This criticism is idiotic because it is clear that person has no clue what he's talking about. 
This criticism should be ignored, the debate should focus on educated arguments.
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:44:55


Those weaknesses are not going to be fixed by regulation. Regulation probably made the market sink more than any of these "corporations". These issues will most likely get fixed in more modern crypto's. The weakness of bitcoin/cryptocurrency is its lack of adoption. Thats the glaring issue, not that some made up strawman super-mega-evil-corporation is controlling the market. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:28:08
I started this because some socialist started a complete strawman about Anarcho Capitalism and Bitcoin which was absolutely false.  There is no irony here just some clueless moron who needs the government to wipe his ass for him started a clueless critique of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:01:30
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:06:33
These criticisisms were made by a person who does not have a clue about how a block chain works.

Yeah because I don't fall for these conspiracies.

What about the buying-a-lamborghini-with-bitcoin prophecy? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:30:36
There is no downside to unregulated exchanges OP just went on a little rant about an caps and claimed that the big bad corporations controll your assets. Which they don't its a strawman. The typical low effort strawman from a statist who does not have a grip on topic at hand. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:50:52


That makes alot of sense /s
Care to elaborate or are you just going  to spam that?

He doesn't invest into tech because he lost alot of money on IBM. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:52:32
An idiotic statement that makes no sense is not going make your argument any more valid.
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:34:28
I don't know what he's on about, by his use of the word "republicuck" he seems to be a socialist troll or just really right wing. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:41:05
What? All you did is call me a "cuck" never explained anything and then started using Ad Hominems like a 12 year old. The fact that you use emojis just further proves your adolescence.
Your argument makes no sense, you just use idiotic buzzwords and Ad Hominems. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 10:51:20
Yes but this is considering the fact that you have just enough money for a lambo and you blow your savings into buying it.

I still dont get why their subreddit isnt called bch , its a clear show of malice.
@_date: 2018-05-13 14:09:35
Yes but the people who buy them probably have a fleet of vehicles.

Thats not censorship, thats sabotage.
Censorship is exclusively about speech and expression. 
You clearly dont know what censorship means. Stealing cash or gold isnt censorship. Its theft.
@_date: 2018-06-09 19:10:23
No its not, seizing monetary assets isn't censorship.
This is the definition of censorship : "*the suppression or prohibition of any parts of books, films, news, etc. that are considered obscene, politically unacceptable, or a threat to security.*"
@_date: 2018-06-14 09:46:27
This isn't a fair comparison, you should compare population % instead of just a flat number that favours later inventions.
@_date: 2018-06-09 19:29:21
You dont get it do you. Censorship is speech and opinion related. Assets aren't speech related. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:38:33
That still has nothing to do with censorship
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:19:28
No you don't,  you can buy gold and stash in your house,
@_date: 2018-06-09 10:29:38
Why is there a censorship resistance category? I don't think people send messages to each other on blocks of gold. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 08:58:52
Yeah because everyone had Lamborghinis under communism
@_date: 2018-02-07 09:17:40
Lmao I never claimed it was a good idea, you have no argument you just stich ad Hominems together because your incapable of debating. 
The fact that you think Socialism is a good idea, says alot about you.
