Just as an example, the Great Depression did not occur because of fiscal policy. If anything, one could say it came about because of an absence of fiscal policy. This was a very large problem, and it was fixed through fiscal policy (FDR's new deal). However, fiscal policy is a separate issue.
You say that all statistics show that monetary policy brings us further from our economic goals. If this was the case, why doesnt the federal reserve just stop?
I agree with you in that monetary policy has not been completely successful in meeting our economic goals. It has however proven quite successful in several instances. Take the most recent recession. That was an economic problem brought about by factors unrelated to monetary policy. Some fiscal policy was put through to help the nation recover, but legislation was held back substantially by disagreements within congress. Fiscal policy was not proving to be enough to bring the nation to recovery. Monetary policy was able to fill this gap and bring the nation back on its feet (yes unemployment is still high, but it has gone down significantly, and the stock market has come to levels above pre-recession times).
Did I ever tell you the definition of insanity? Anyway, about that point. The fact that monetary policy is not perfect does not imply that having no monetary policy would be perfect. The ideal method could involve more monetary policy, no monetary policy, or anywhere in between.

How would monetary policy work in such a system?

But the U.S. needs monetary policy as its primary means for stabilizing the economy (meeting economic goals such as employment, distribution of wealth, and low inflation). If we have no control over the currency, we cant fix problems except through fiscal policy, which has proven very difficult with the increased polarization of congress.
