If every year you had to give an organisation 100 Blips (a currency which that organisation issues), or else they would instigate a process that eventually would lead you to forcibly having things you owned seized and or you ending up in jail, if you could not provide those Blips - you would definitely accept Blips in exchange for things of tangible value.
If 300 million people were under the same circumstances, Blips would have a very real common exchange value.

This is the best part.

For one, Taxes are more than just income taxes, so they're not a once a year thing. There are import tariffs, sales taxes, property taxes, etc. People would need Blips year round.
But even if taxes were just a yearly thing, that doesn't mean that it has no value.

I'll trade you an apple for $5000 USD then - because you're probably not confident that it will be worth anything in the near future.

There over 6 trillion in USD would be needed yearly to pay taxes, so yeah I think there would be a fair deal of value.

I mean, lots of fiat currencies exist. Why do you suppose they have value?
