It's a nice little app. I won't be storing all my BTC on it, because I've had phones stolen lost/stolen before. But it's useful to keep a little currency for coffee and other incidentals. Good job KNC.

Believe me, I'm no fan of Josh or BFL. But after reading through "Attachment X", he actually comes off as less evil than the rest of the BFL gang. Maybe by Nov 2013 he had just gotten tired of spouting lies for BFL on the forums and getting called out for it by the bitcoin community.

If you decide to invest, be sure to become a proponent too.  Use your bitcoin to buy and sell goods and services; don't just let it sit there.  The more people accept and USE bitcoin, the more valuable it becomes.

Phineas is pretty notorious on bitcointalk. He posted this thread then deleted his Reddit account. He could also be the anonymous guy who said he is a former employee.  
I don't understand the motive. I'll wait for other news sources to confirm before I believe any of this.

It's kind of surprising that they're taking this angle in their investigation. Instead of focusing on consumer complaints and BFL's shady business practices, they are going for Sonny V's probation issues.  
But at least there is some kind of investigation going on, and that's a good thing in my opinion.

I don't know... I just think early BFL customers got hit harder.
I didn't suffer too hard myself. I paid for a 60gh with paypal+credit card in March 2013. After waiting 8 months and BFL refusing to give me a refund, I just had the credit card company get involved and got my money back.  BFL was more of an annoyance and dissappointment to me than a hardship.

What I like about my Coinbase wallet is that they have two factor authentication.  I feel pretty good about leaving bitcoin in their hands.  My bank (Wells Fargo) doesn't do two factor authentication, I feel more secure with Coinbase than I do with my bank.
Not all my BTC are stored with Coinbase, but I have them sitting there ready to use.

If you had bought BTC with your $40k last week at $475 and sold them today at $500, you would have profitted $2k.

My parents are both gone. But my dad was an engineer who designed core memory modules back in the 60s.  He saw that silicon was the wave of the future and got out of memory design and got into sales.  He died in the 1980s and never lived to see the personal computer revolution, but he was amazed by my Timex Sinclair back then. I wish he had lived to see what we do with computers these days.
And I have to think that he'd have more bitcoin than I do right now.

Totally agree. It's against their business model.  They was recurring payments. They can automatically charge your credit card every month, but they can't withdraw bitcoin from your wallet the same way.  
I don't see it happening any time soon.

I hope the FTC and the courts consider situations like yours closely.  Customers who paid with bitcoin early in the scam got hurt much worse than customers who paid with cash.

I have been using Coinbase to pay for stuff for a few years now. I admit I did have a problem with them a little while back but their support fixed the issue. I don't use them as an exchange, I use them as a temporary wallet. It's convenient.

I have two things to say:
1. Don't keep all your eggs in one basket.  I keep some BTC i coinbase and I believe they are safe.  I use 2-factor authentication and a very strong password. I keep the rest in two different wallets.
2. Use part of this windfall to pay off your debt if you have any.  Just remember when you convert to fiat currency, the tax man will be knocking at your door.

This makes me wary of the whole bitcoin idea. The guy gives 1.6 BTC to someone else and it cost 80 BTC to do the transaction? There's a very fishy smell about this.  
Maybe I'm wrong but I'm thinking in terms of cash.  If I have 100 *n* and give someone 1.6 *n*, they should wind up with +1.6 *n* and I should wind up with 98.4 *n*.  In what uiniverse does it cost 80 *n* to give someone 1.6 *n* ???

I'd like to see one ASIC manufacturer actually **build** a product and then **sell** it.  Other electronic device manufacturers do this all the time.  They analyse the market demand, create a manufacturing process that can meet the demand, produce enough inventory to cover the initial sales expectations, then sell the product at a price determined by their market analysis.  
BFL does it back-asswards. It seems to me that they were sitting around getting drunk and one of them said, "*Let's photoshop a GPU and tell them it's an ASIC. We'll figure out how to make it when we sober up.  LOLZ*".  Then they all high-fived and ordered more shots.
Well I'm not buying it, pal. Talk to me when you have some inventory.
Would you pre-order your cell phone?  (Apple fanbois excluded)
Would you pre-order a television or a toaster?
I know what you're gonna say, "It's different when you're buying a machine that spits money out of it's ass."   Well, not to me it isn't. This pre-order business model is targeted specifically to greedy little monkeys with more money than brains.

I believe small claims courts have limits on the amount you can sue for. A $30k lawsuit would probably have to go to a regular court.
BFL is doing business out of Kansas, so you might want to contact a lawyer from the Kansas bar association.  Talk to a few of them until you find one that can help you.
Another thing you should do is contact the Kansas Attorney General's office and file a complaint.  The process is sure to be slow, but at least it would get something going.

It's more my fault for being greedy than it is BFL's fault for profiting off my greed. Barnum said it first, there's a sucker born every minute.

They are still 12 months behind on 50ghs orders.  So if you bought one of them in 2013, don't expect to get it until 2014.  
I bought in April 2013, waited until August and then got my refund from BFL.  I paid via Paypal and credit card, so it was just a matter of calling my credit card company.  BFL refused the refund twice, but as soon as the CC company got into it, I got the refund.
