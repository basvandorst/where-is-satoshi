Well he did receive 64 dust transactions and then spend them...it's like going into the 7-11 and trying to pay with a jar full of pennies...

Um, they enter your address and the amount you sent them click "Send"?
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:54:27
The same thing can happen on pretty much any payment service.
For example same thing on Paypal; you can send someone a Paypal link with your account and amount already in it...but if for some reason the sender is a dumbass, ignores the payment link, manually login to their paypal account and decide to randomly send some other amount to some other email account you have...this is possible. (and does happen).
There's not much paypal or coinbase etc...can do about this without restricting peoples ability to manually send payments.
The support guy seems like kind of a douche, but he is basically right, they can't read minds.
@_date: 2016-08-02 04:32:06
This is a pretty misleading about Thailand.
At  our trading volumes dwarf the localbitcoin volumes by 10x+, but our volumes at the moment are much lower than they were 4 or 5 months ago.
Previously we're had volumes of 2,000BTC+ per day, at the moment volumes are around 200-300BTC per day (still 10 times higher than the localbitcoins volume).
So to say that "Bitcoin volumes in Thailand are at a high record" is just misleading and false...when it fact it means that the very small volume traded on localbitcoins is at an all time high.
Not that bitcoin is losing popularity here...it's just that record high volumes tend to correspond to when the price is increasing dramatically...which it currently is not.

Not if they only used their vault address for internal transactions (ie when they topup their hot wallet from their cold (vault) address.
So if they miscalculate the amount of BTC needed in their hot wallet then yes you'd have to wait longer with their cold storage movement went through.

You'll find a detailed analysis of what went on here: 
@_date: 2016-08-02 08:01:21
I'm not sure where you getting this from "You said all of your holdings were provable, now you are claiming they are not"...I said all of our holdings are shown publically, and we can prove holdings of millions (which i have done with regards to BTC holdings).
Your statements seem to be full of contradictions, on the one hand we are a fly-by-night operation that has no customers, and no trading, and no holdings.
But on the other hand you say we have been in the community for a long time and running for a long time and it's easy to believe I personally have amassed thousands of bitcoins?
So which is it?
@_date: 2016-08-04 05:58:35
I'm guessing that Bitgo probably bent over backwards to appease bitfinex (one of, if not the biggest client).
Bitfinex: "Your stupid fraud checks keep blocking transfers"
Bitgo: "Sorry sir we'll ease the fraud screening all the way back"
Bitfinex: "Your dumb total limit keeps getting hit and we have to adjust it every day!"
Bitgo: "Sorry sir we'll remove those pesky limits so you don't need to keep adjusting them" etc...
They probably ending up basically disabling all the security features...and what you're left with is security in name only.  Especially as it appears that only reason bitfinex set this up was to check a box for the regulators.
That's probably why bitfinex is not pointing any fingers because they know that all conversations will point to them asking bitgo to remove all the security features.

Tesseract sucks unless you train it which is long and difficult; an out of the box good OCR is difficult to find; I have found other paid APIs that are more a lot better than any free solutions (example  )

@_date: 2016-08-11 12:22:21
@_date: 2016-08-09 12:05:30
So as I understand it you requested a bitcoin payment to a bitcoin address, but instead of sending it to the bitcoin address, the sender entered your email address and clicked send?
Because you did have a coinbase account with that email address then the transaction went through to your coinbase account?
This seems like expected behavior on part of their system?
Would you expect them to block payments being manually sent to your email account?  Or what solution?
@_date: 2016-08-02 09:08:14
I'm not going to continue this; it's a bit silly that you are still holding a grudge just because I made you look a bit silly on bitcointalk 3 years ago, move on already.

I like it, TLDR: create a special address type that has a reversal key that can be used to cancel transactions within 24hours...this can be used for internal vaults.
I don't see a downside to this?  As long as the vault addresses are clearly different from standard addresses and wallets handle them properly.
@_date: 2016-08-23 14:00:59
The market looks interesting, so I signed up to test out the OCR api.
Unfortunately when attempting to use this service it takes forever (churns for like 30 seconds +), then returns this (instead of the OCR text):
    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
    &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;
    &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;html,body,iframe{margin:0;padding:0;height:100%;}iframe{display:block;width:100%;border:none;}&lt;/style&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Application Error&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;iframe src="//s3.amazonaws.com/heroku_pages/error.html"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Application Error&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
The Zipcode API actually works, but soooo slow (ie like 10seconds to return zip info)...I can't imagine anyone can actually be using these APIs?

This would mean removing coinbase users' ability to manually send to an email address, which many consider a useful feature.
You seems to be making more out of this than it really is?  Can't you just login to your coinbase and withdraw the bitcoins out to whichever address you wanted them at?
@_date: 2016-08-02 05:14:54
You may want to adjust your article title to accurately reflect this this, as in:

While it's true that fiat holdings cannot be cryptographically proven, you'll see that our BTC holds are about similar to our fiat holdings (which would make sense for an exchange).
And the BTC holdings are certainly provable, most of which is held in our cold storage: 
The idea that we somehow have amassed a large amount of provable bitcoins, but yet have no fiat and no trading volume doesn't make any sense.
Notice that our cold storage always pays out to 1HtqDMWgn6186e8t3EesZQiw7gNbaPJfJH, and here is a signed message to prove we own it:

@_date: 2016-08-11 14:10:15
Cost of transactions are based on the size of the transaction (large transaction = high cost).
Your transaction is large because you are spending many inputs (64 inputs).  Which essentially is similar to making 64 transactions (not quite as would be a bit larger to do them all individual but you get the idea).
This is just the way bitcoin works not really to do with Bitgo.

@_date: 2016-08-03 00:54:38
Does this mean that transaction was not even signed by a bitgo key (ie was signed via the keys held solely by bitfinex), or does it mean bitgo did in fact sign it, but apparently see no problem with that?

True, but I'm not sure that any miners are using altruistic algorithm such as this.

You could run it with the prune setting which means that you require very little disk space, and run a digital ocean node for about $10 a month.
With full blockchain you could use AWS, I think a t2.micro should be enough ($15 per month), plus disk space of about 100GB is about $12 per month...plus bandwidth this will depend on your throttle settings.
So on AWS maybe $30-$40 per month...should be enough.

A fee sum check built into the protocol, so there is a "fee" field in the transaction and if the fee != unallocated inputs then transaction is invalid.
Devs could even make the fee field optional (so no fee field is present the old rules apply), that way anyone creating raw transactions can choose to include a fee field as a safety precaution.

IMHO the protocol should require a "fee" field in transactions and "fee" + "outputs" must equal "inputs" for the transaction to be valid...raw transactions can be very scary due to the fact that currently whatever isn't output is considered the fee.

Agreed with skilliard4.  A combination of the monthly formula and an annual hard limit is the way to go.
That way even if a "super-majority cartel" decide to increase the blocks to the max every single month they will never be able to go over the annual hard limit anyway.
Going from 1MB straight to 20MB seems far more likely to result in spam blocks than going "up to 20%" month per with a max of 20MB this year.

It's easy to verify the balances by any group of account holders.  An account holder can view the list and find their own balance and check it to be correct.  If a number of users do this and all results are correct then it's highly improbable that any balances have been left out.  (The more people who check it the more improbable).  If any user were to find their balance missing or incorrect it would invalidate the whole system.

I take it you've never done a Bitcoin transaction which required you to wait for a confirmation?  Especially if you get hit with a 40minute block wait.
I guess next time someone says "Wire transfers taking 3-5 days is too long" I can just use your argument and say "Too long for what; your hi-tech hipster instagram lifestyle?"

itBit may have all the fancy certificates, but their system is in serious need of improvement:
- Bitcoin withdrawals are processed the next business day...(so you try to get bitcoins out on Friday night, you get them Monday).  This is very annoying.
* The API is very limited.  Such as no way to check on pending withdrawals (which as mentioned above can take 3 days), but during this time your funds disappear from your balance...so basically disappear into a 3 day blackhole, which are no where visible on the API.
* The site is often showing 500 errors
* They require 6 confirmations for deposits, and often don't show up before 10 confirmations (also no where does it show incoming deposits, so to new users this can be quite unnerving when your deposits has 8 confirmations and shows no where in the site)
* There are often rounding errors that do not allow you withdraw your full balance
* Personally I dislike the maker rebate vs taker fees.  As it means you have to monkey around with your trades in order to be the "maker", as this can be the difference between a profit and loss.
* Trades of amount "0" often show in the orderbook
* Often bugs are released into their system with version updates
* Site sends too many emails and no way to disable, such as email for every single login, or email for every time you incorrect enter your 2fa.  It's overkill.  Basically just login, make a trade and withdraw you've got like 5 emails (none requiring any action)
To be honest their system is quite far behind most other exchanges; but there did verify my account, and fiat withdrawals arrive in a reasonable time at a reasonable cost.  I would like to see them improve their system, but I have not seen them roll out any significant updates in the last year.
*ITBIT* if you are reading; improvement on bitcoin withdrawal speed would be my  request.
@_date: 2014-10-15 12:53:04
Read some of the logs; and to be honest do not help you case any.  If you do not seem to realize that an *online* ATM needs a 100% reliable internet connection; or how to get your Bitstamp API key (takes like 5 seconds, you need a manual for this??)...then what hope did you have of operating a Bitcoin ATM??
You start off by giving the support guy a whole bib full about late delivery and having to pay the full price; I understand that you were rightfully annoyed, but he probably had very little to do with the purchase process and not exactly the best way to endear yourself to the support tech that you going to have to be dealing with for the setup process.

I don't see why for example if version 1 requires 2 keys; why would the network start allowing script version 1 transactions to be processed as if they were script version 2?  Nodes would validate as version 1 requires 2 keys, version 2 requires 1 key; this transaction is version 1, so needs 2 keys.
Couldn't the bugs in the code implementation be fixed?  Or is there a fundamental flaw in the logic?
I'm looking to understand the pros/cons of the concepts, obviously any implementation of any concept can be written poorly or have bugs in it; but it doesn't nullify the concept.

You can sign messages and transactions offline without ever making it "hot". 
@_date: 2017-02-01 04:06:24
But it would; each transaction would need to have a script version, so that if you want to spend an UTXO that UTXO would be in a transaction, which would have a script version associated with it.  So each input in a TX would be processed based on it's associated script version.  Or you mean that script version can be omitted, in which case couldn't there just a default script version for this case (such as default to 1 if omitted)

At  our frontend servers have been with AWS from day one, and AWS is an awe inspiring system.  Light years ahead of traditional rented dedicated/shared servers.  The AWS uptime has been 100% since we've been using them and scalability is unreal (within 10 minutes we can scale our system from running on 1 server instance to 100).
Having said that, we don't actually keep any private keys on AWS; that is where we draw the line.  We decided to run our own physical wallet server at our own physical location; with extremely limited access.  The wallet server does not need to handle any traffic, other than our own backend API, so the advantages of AWS are not really applicable.
Trying to run your webserver on your own local hardware is not really feasible anymore; customers expect 100% uptime, and lightning fast connections 24/7.  You are going to be hard pressed to compete with AWS with your own server rack and internet connection (and you'll end up paying a lot more).

The purpose of faking volume is to make the exchange seem bigger; and thus attracting more customers to the exchange because of the large volume.
However with some exchanges this has turned into a runaway feedback loop because all the other exchanges started to fake the volume to keep up, and continue to fake more and more in order to remaining the biggest.
How does this relate to "price manipulation" though?  Specifically in what way do you believe that they have altering the the price, and using what methods?

As I understand it you can just check the "sequence" value on each of the transaction inputs...if the value is less than 4294967295 then it's a RBF transaction and you should wait for 1 confirmation at least.
If the sequence value is 4294967295 then the unconfirmed transaction is as safe as before.  Probably wallets will start to build some kind of warning to handle this.

Because there are no "fees" in transactions, there are only the amount of inputs that were not spent to the outputs.  (so if there are inputs of 10 BTC and outputs of 9 BTC then the miner gets the 1BTC that's unaccounted for as their fee)
So to change the fees you must either adjust the inputs or the outputs (or both)...at which point who is to say how much the output or inputs can be adjusted?

@_date: 2017-03-09 13:49:45
The funny part is that this attack would be far more effective against the BU chain, because by taking the block limits off and trying to the drive the BTU fees basically to zero they will be open to a huge amount of blockchain bloat at almost no cost to the attacker.
For example I have a ton of dust sat around here: 
All of a sudden I will have the ability to start moving this dust around the BTU network at no cost; but using up lots of blockchain space.
Whereas with BTC the fee market will still exist, so unless the attackers are a true zealot willing to totally destroy their BTC holdings by paying them out in fees; then their attack won't do much.
I imagine the BTU chain will start to get much bigger very quickly.

Well for example with our  service if you get a payment which is marked RBF (sequence below 4294967295) then it will not even show in your merchant account as a transaction until it has 1 confirmation (because currently no users really have any business using RBF when paying merchants)...

Bitcoin is not "supposed" to serve any specific sector of people.  Bitcoin is not "for the poor" or "for the rich", etc...it's just a protocol for sending value...and currently the market dictates (how much people are willing to pay for blockchain space) that it costs about $0.10 per input you spend...users must then make the decision if the value proposition makes sense for their use case.
If most people are like Alice and unwilling to pay this much fees for blockchain space then the demand will drop and fees will become less.
But currently people are willing to pay this much, because there are still plenty of transactions being sent at the currently fee rate.
And no matter what the fees are, you are still going to get some people who's use case does not make sense for the fee amount...ie if I want to spend 1,000,000 inputs of $0.00000001 each, why do I need to pay a whole $0.0001 fee, it's too much?

In your example she would need to receive around 250 transactions (to fill 50KB of inputs) for only $500, so roughly $2.00 per transactions...
Even with a $30 fee it is still about the same as you'd pay with Paypal micropayments...even though micropayments such as this are about the most inefficient use of the Bitcoin fee system (ie you could receive $5,000,000 and still pay the same fee)

To be fair that is a fail on the part of the ATM operator that they re-sent your transaction and refused to credit you until their own internal tx went through (which really had nothing to do with you).
@_date: 2016-11-23 13:56:28


If the value proposition is destroyed then large entities won't be able to use it for making million dollar transfers, so system becomes cheaper and usable about by Alice again...so your problem seems to solve itself.
1) If Alice is receiving hundreds of $2.00 transactions it doesn't really matter which inputs she selects they are all going to cost the same to spend.  If there a varying amounts of inputs then most wallet software will select the most efficient set of inputs to spend in order to minimize the fees automatically.  Plus many wallets have controls that allow you to select which inputs to spend if you want to manual choose (but due to automatic efficiency you don't need to)
2) Well obviously she's going to need to receive transactions to receive the funds...i don't see how they could get the funds to her without creating an unspend input for her
3) Sure there is; if I asked someone to pay me $10 in bitcoin, and then sent me 100 different micro transactions I'd tell them to f*** off and send it properly. And would not acknowledge this an acceptable payment.
4) Sure; would be nice.  Not sure how technically feasible it would be to update the protocol in this manner though.

With the current recurring DoS attacks you don't need to do zero-fees.  You can just do below recommended fees (or even 0.0001 BTC/kb) and still the transaction may take so long to confirm it drops out the mempool and then can easily be double spent.

I really hate this "Bitcoin is an Experiment" that gets used all the time...
I would consider something an "Experiment" when you set up an activity to test a hypothesis, and then during the activity you record data and analyze the data to see if your hypothesis was correct.
How does that apply to Bitcoin?  Just because you don't know if something will be popular/successful doesn't mean it's an experiment...
Maybe next time i go to the horses I'll say "I'm going to experiment at the track"...or next time they interview someone before a 100m sprite he'll say "I'm getting ready for the experiment"

How does this actually work?  As I understood it xpub can be used to generate any number of addresses; but you still need to check each individual address after generating it?
So for example: if I use an xpub with n=24124 to generate address  and send some BTC to this address will it show up in the blockexplorers?  (If so how are they handling checking infinity addresses?)
Or will the explorers only check until the next empty address on the xpub, so in the above example no transaction would show up?

I don't see it as Litecoin pumping...my thinking is more that Litecoin would work as a good test bed to show that Segwit can work without a hitch, so that it can then be more easily accepted into Bitcoin.

Because you don't want to be polling every second as this would create performance overhead...
So for example if you were running a merchant service were you'd like to send a signal back to your webserver the instance a new payment is received... you could use walletnotify...
Then you could poll every minute, to pickup anything missed and also check the confirmation levels of your transactions.
@_date: 2016-02-26 14:01:57
Probably they have to wait for confirmation if it has a rbf tag on the tx, but no legit wallets send with a rbf flag
@_date: 2017-04-05 11:37:56
walletnotify seems to work fine; but if you are looking for a robust system you probably want to use walletnotify for instant notifications then poll the listsinceblock on a CRON also.
That way if for some reason walletnotify fails to trigger you will pick it up slightly delayed on your polling anyways.

The tool generates raw transactions that you can push anywhere that will take them...I assume (based on the 2 transactions in the video having different fees) that Glass Hut is doing the same thing of just generating 2 transactions with different fees.

It's not about devs, it's about mining power.
Segwit2X has 95% of the hashing power, which means blocktimes on the old chain will drop to about 7 blocks per day, and become unusable.
The only way 1X can survive on 5% mining power is to hardfork the difficulty...in which case this destroys the entire premise of the 1X position, which is being against hardforks at any cost...

Firstly as a Bitcoin user there a couple of present date realities that must be accepted:
1) Bitcoin price is volatile
2) Bitcoin must be exchanged for merchants to pay their supply chain
While these are true then there will be a cost involved in Bitcoin payments; the costs being the volatility risk (chance the price may decrease while merchant or payment process is holding the Bitcoins) and the exchanging cost (processing costs for exchange, or payment processing middle men and movement of funds after the exchange).
Given this, we can see that there *will be costs* involve in merchant acceptance of Bitcoin.  Now the question becomes how to handle these costs; they can either be passed onto the merchant, or passed onto consumer.
In an ideal world I think most people would agree that a healthy Bitcoin ecosystem is one in which the number of merchants accepting Bitcoin and the number of people wanting to use Bitcoin is well balanced, and fairly equal.
In my experience this is not the case, and there are many more Bitcoin users wanting to pay with Bitcoin, than merchants willing to accept it (simply put there are not enough places for me to spend my Bitcoins).
If you want more merchants to start accepting Bitcoin then we need to offer them the carrot that it is cheaper and easy for them than credit cards...so unfortunately the users have to draw the short straw and eat some of the above mentioned costs.
Simply saying that Bitpay, Coinbase, Bitnet should setup a cash negative business model (which even now may to be case; re: bitpay cutting it's staff and sponsorship deals) does not seem to be a viable argument, as eventually if they do not make money, they will go out of business.  Or saying that merchants should accept Bitcoin for some ideological views is not reasonable; while some do, most will not.
In conclusion I think Bitcoin users should accept that in the short term Bitcoin may not be the cheapest way for you to pay for things, in fact it's very likely that paying with a credit card will be cheaper for you.  But paying more to use Bitcoin now will nurture the tiny ecosystem, and allow it to grow to the point where it is no longer highly volatile and no longer requires exchanging (because so many merchants accept Bitcoin that whole supply chains can be paid in Bitcoin).  At this point Bitcoin will be much cheaper; but not until then.

And there appear to be some claims circulating that the US has a lower "violent crime" rate than the UK, but actually those stats are based on a different definition of "violent crime" with the UK having a much broader definition than the US. (ie grabbing an old lady's purse would qualify as "violent crime" in the UK, but not in the US)

A) The mining chip will have a useful life; after which it will be so inefficient compared to new chips that it will basically earn near to nothing.  You can predict this amount...and then could be extra generous (seeing as there is a lot of saved costs for no chip) and pre-load it will 4x as much BTC as it would ever earn from mining.
B) RE: The cost of the API...you still need to write your service even using this device.
C) If guy in Africa is able to find somewhere to buy this device why can't he go back to the same place and have them top it up with some more BTC?

I used prosper quite a lot before they were "regulated" and had a lot of success (earning 10-15% per year) on mostly A-B rated loans (zero defaults).
But then they did that big shutdown to jump through regulation hoops and cut out my state.
But with prosper you were lending to real people, with real credit scores.

This is fundamental to how bitcoin works..it cannot just be "abstracted away".
When you spend some coins you must sign the coins (unspent input) that you are spending.  So if a transaction has more inputs, it's going to use more data (because of the reference and signature of each input).
More data = more cost.
Simply saying "This is confusing it needs to go away; smart people will fix it"...is very dumb.
A "fix" would be a totally different structure, such as one where addresses just have a "balance"...this has it's own set of problems (look into stellar/ripple)...but this would no longer be Bitcoin at all.
Bitcoin is not 100% fungible, it never has been, and never will be.  In the same way that different denominations of cash are not fungible (no one is going to accept 10,000 pennies for your dinner out).

That would be my guess...probably feeling the pressure from investors that they don't have anything to "show" for all that money yet...so probably throwing this out there to get them to ease off.

How about just buy a raspberry pi2, memory card, install Bitcoin core and buy about $80 worth of BTC.

I don't have any customers with regards to this script...it is an open source tool which people can use...i don't want to put in the $30 or so a year to put into an SSL.   Anyone is free to download the source and run it in the manner they see fit, such as on their own server with their own SSL, or locally.
The github employee comment is true, but equally github employees could potentially edit the source people are downloading and mask it or other kind of shenanigans...or i could just serve bad JS directly...there is always potential for malice when using another service...SSL or not...so if using it for more than just throw away money run it locally (I don't benefit from what the 'customer' does either way).
@_date: 2015-09-23 08:59:44
All these things can be done without this device.
Example: 1. Watermark a PDF or Jpeg. Charge per page or per watermark.
Steps to do it without $400 device:
1) Setup webserver $5-10 a month
2) Write an API; users must request a token and are given a bitcoin address, once a payment is receive to the address give them an authorization token.
Monitor the addresses with blockcypher.com or chain.com callbacks (so no need for any heavy bitcoin core)
3) Users sends auth. token and image to the API
4) Return users the image with watermark.
Total cost: $5-$10 per month (inc. electricity) and it will be a ton more reliable than a raspberry pi on your home connection.  Upfront hardware costs $0.
If service is really heavily used get a better webserver and install bitcoin core to monitor your addresses.

Currently there are a lot of people accepting 0-confirmation transactions with no fraud screening (they see a transaction, then they accept it immediately)...hopefully this tool will raise awareness that it's not safe to do that.
0-confirmation transactions can still be accepted but people need to be aware that they are not safe, and that additional inspection of the transaction details are required to analyze the risk of fraud associated with the transaction.
A simple analysis of the tx fee would be enough to stop someone from being tricked by this tool...yet alot of people don't currently do that.
@_date: 2015-09-07 07:34:45
Currently the app is set to use a fee of 0.000001 (which assuming fairly new coin-age) is way lower than most nodes will allow to broadcast; and bc.info will allow it.
@_date: 2015-09-07 09:31:40
The site is javascript and runs client-side so the SSL would make no difference seeing as no data is sent to the server.
(You can also download the source from github and run it locally)
@_date: 2015-09-07 03:54:21
~~No page currently.~~ (now has a help button with some details)
The script will generate 2 transactions.  One with a normal fee, and one with a much below recommended fee.
blockchain.info will accept the crap fee and relay it (most other services would reject it).
You then wait until your target has received a relay of the unconfirmed transaction and broadcast the bottom transaction with proper fee (to blockr.io), which will accept the new transaction because it sees the first transaction as invalid due to insufficient fee.
Second transaction will relay to all nodes that rejected the first transaction...(and so probably reach the miners before the first transaction).
It will have a much better success rate if done during a "stress test"...in which case you can literally wait days until you spend the second transaction.
@_date: 2015-09-11 05:34:11
I've swept around 20,000 inputs so far: 
IMHO this "DDOS" will have no effect on the network because the input amounts are so low (almost all 0.00001) that you can't make any transactions with even close to recommended min. fee (of 0.0001 per KB) so none of these transactions will take priority over normal transactions.
I'm only get 0.00001 profit for every 0.0001 that goes to miners.
@_date: 2015-09-30 01:05:26

The idea behind it is that it's something simple to use on the go...where all you need to do is remember your brain wallet, don't even need to remember your address (no offline signing processing etc...)
If you are going to do an electrum signing process you may as well just manually generate the 2 transactions in electrum while you at it (no need for this tool at all)....but you're not going to be able to do all that while trying to "buy" a cup of coffee :D

This is the kind of mentality that keeps Bitcoin down.
"If it's not cheaper/faster/better/seamless from day 1, then I'd rather it not exist at all".
If you'd really prefer that a merchant who accepts Bitcoins (but due to low usage fumbles around), should just stop accepting Bitcoin....why are you even posting here?
Just use cash, all merchants know how to accept it seamlessly.
Even if their staff were trained at some point, if no one ever uses Bitcoin, and then 6 months after the training someone wants to use it, it will require some fumbling and asking the manager.
Or should merchants be required to do a monthly refresher course for a payment method that no one has used for the month??
It's better just to accept the mindset that when you visit a Bitcoin accepting place for the first time you are probably going to have to help them through the process.  But after a few visits it works like clockwork.
But trust me it will get better.  I visit a kebab shop every week to pay in Bitcoin, the first few times it was very slow they had to find the manager, then get the phone out, then load the app etc... (one week phone was broken couldn't accept bitcoin)
Now they have a dedicated phone, that just runs the app, it's already ready at the register, and the process is as fast as paying cash.

Ok so instead of the user side also having this $400 device plugged in (so total $800 savings now for both user and provider), the user could simply have some code in their API calling software which automatically sends the Bitcoins, which come pre-loaded with the software, to pay for the watermarking service.

It's no use in just repeating the same lines and hope that it has a different affect on people..."SEGWIT IS A BLOCK SIZE INCREASE" has clearly not swayed public opinion.
One side is demanding block size increase for non-segwit address transaction (and not in the sense of some transactions being moved into segwit make the existing space more available)....simply as in: right now you can fit 1MB of standard transactions into a block, they want more than 1MB of standard transactions.
Segwit does not allow you to fit more than 1MB of standard (non segwit transactions) into a block.

The nature of a compromise is that you do not agree with what the other side thinks/wants, and they don't agree you with.

Technically it will always be more efficient (cheaper/faster) to run a centralized database (ie SQL etc...) than a distributed trustless blockchain...

But these were easier selling points than being in control of your own money.
So now the salesmen would rather throw out the main purpose of Bitcoin to make it align to their erroneous selling points, instead of owning up the fact that they were promoting false promises.

You can also import address without rescanning; especially useful if you know the address has not yet been used.  Or if you are importing multiple addresses you can import each without rescan and then do one rescan at the end.

With variance it can be two hours between blocks (and that has always been the case), that doesn't sound "almost instant" to me.
I'd like to see the block times increased by that doesn't seem to be up for discussion anywhere.
So with the fees; who are we to say how inexpensive or expensive it will be in the future?  Even without a block limit fees are designed to be market driven... the market in the future may price fees as more expensive than a wire transfer...so why would you promote Bitcoin based on promises (low fees) when you don't have any idea what the future market will decide a reasonable fee is?
Instead Bitcoin should be properly explained; that fees are market based and you must bid to get miners to include your transaction...this isn't a sexy selling point, but it's the truth and if the potential user can't be bothered to understand it then maybe they can buy some onecoins instead...those really are free and instant.

IMHO a bitcoin ATM should have like 5 or 6 fallbacks (as they have a physical person actually waiting on site for the machine to do stuff).  So if a single explorer or node goes down it's no problem.
Obviously not much that can be done about actual slow confirmation times, but that's not the case here.
The trouble is these ATM don't really seem economically feasible; so most of the owners are just hobbists/enthusiasts who run the machine as a hobby instead of as putting food on their table.  Thus they are not too concerned if the machine is down X% per day...as opposed to making sure the machine is 99.9999% uptime (with multiple internet connections, heavy battery backups etc...)

Because miners that want big blocks and don't necessarily want segwit are willing to put through segwit in exchange for bigger blocks.
This is the natural of a compromise; you bundle them together so that everyone gets something they want, and something they didn't want...but at least then we get some forward progress.
IMHO the compromise is very fair and reasonable; I never liked the idea of 'unlimited' blocks, or blocks that could be adjusted by miner as it's too much of any unknown, but everyone can live with 2MB...that's more than reasonable.

If you told me "the bill is 1BTC" and i sent you 1BTC in 10000 transactions of 0.1mBTC you would have received 1BTC, but you probably would not be happy and would not consider the bill fully paid.

If 1+1 != 2 then it's not "fungible"...
@_date: 2016-05-13 02:23:01
This just to generate the address, you'll then to store the address and monitor it for transactions either using an API (such as blockr.io or blockcypher.com or NOT blockchain.info etc...) or using your own bitcoin node.
For most sites using an external API is better; only if you are planning on doing a high volume of BTC transactions with a high probability of bad actors (such as an exchange or BTC gambling site) is your own full node really needed.
Also for the addresses to match the electrum addresses I believe you need to set the child to:
0/0  ,  0/1,   0/2  etc...

I have and generate less small outputs now that in the past (but sometimes it's unavoidable especially if you are the receiver); but still doesn't unstuck the existing small outputs.  Also there are a lot of amounts have are not 'stuck' but are non economically feasible to spend (ie would you pay an 90% fee?  You may as well just leave the output sat there for that fee %)   And the amount outputs that fall into this category are constantly increasing as the fee increases. 
I'm not saying that it's wrong; I mean I'm a believer in the fee market and you should have to outbid others for blockspace...but I'm just relaying the reality that I do have stuck outputs as a result.

As long as you're not spending your bitcoins you are fine (no chance of losing anything).
If you are still running bitcoin core after the fork then it will just look like the blockchain is frozen...you will not see new blocks coming in (or maybe 1 every couple of days).

It would impact it if the exchange is trying to spend unconfirmed inputs.  ie they send a withdrawal, and then immediately use the change from that transaction for another withdrawal.
If you chain together unconfirmed transactions like this and then a transaction ID of one of the transactions changes it will screw up the whole chain of transactions and it would be a major pain to deal with.
Solution is to not try to spend unconfirmed change; but this requires some kind of buffer in your withdrawal system (ie you cannot just instantly do a withdrawal transaction for every withdrawal request, you need to group requests together)
I don't know if this is really the case for Cryptsy (it wasn't for Gox).

Adding the fee after the fact also has its problems (and probably will get more customer complaints); complaints that customers won't be able to withdraw their full balance.
So if customer has 1BTC balance the max withdrawal they would be able to request would be 1BTC - Fee (so for example 0.999 BTC)...this will result in tons of angry "Why  can't i get my full balance out!" emails.
Whereas if you let them request a 1BTC withdrawal but then subtract the fee from the amount sent customer is happy they were able to "get all their money out"...

Note that a possible remedy for this situation could be to penalize (fee-wise) transactions that create additional UTXO, and incentivize transactions that reduce the number of UTXOs.
Currently the default fee calculations are based only on tx size.  And seeing as the inputs/signatures take up a lot more space than the outputs this means that currently the opposite is true (making a mess of the UTXO set is cheap and cleaning up the mess is expensive)

Couple of other plausible explanations:

3) CloudBet manually did a password reset for some reason
Infact if the hacker had access to all the plaintext passwords, why would he need to do any password changes at all?  Doing so would be pointless (as he already has access) and would only serve to get his intrusion detected.

Both chains are set to the same retarget and blocktime, so once one chain gets significantly ahead the other chain will never catchup, because adding more miners to your chain just results in a difficulty adjustment and same blocktime.
Unless there was some kind of very fast and massive movement of miners from one chain to the other within a single retarget window....and if the chain they are already on is already significantly ahead, it makes no sense for them to do that.
