I'd recommend posting this over at  since they'd be able to provide you with a better answer / breakdown than I, but think there is a general agreement amongst many in the netsec field is that biometrics really don't make good passwords, but great identifiers. 
You're right in noting that the difficulty of many of the attacks are out of reach for most attackers and probably not worth the trouble for a couple hundred dollars, so no harm no foul, but seeing as how crypto is at the heart of bitcoin, I like to think we strive towards that in our software.

Could you explain what is shady about them? 
I ask because it seems some of they're key employees, are *active* and highly evangelist contributors to the bitcoin space.. 
Also I've haven't heard much in the way of shady practices by the site itself.

| secure identity mechanism and can replace the need for passwords.
A heads up - touch ID is not a password and shouldn't be used as such.

Great conference and seems like we may have crossed paths at some point since it looks like we attended similar panels.  Here are some of my take aways:
* taxation - no clear guidance other than CRA, other then they see purchases with bitcoin as barter, so tax on value of good regardless value of coin. 
* ambiguity can lead to users being able to fall under different tax guidelines and save / spend on tax. 
* Etherium is the cool kid in town, and has potential to be the one coin that does it all. 
* lack of definitions makes a grey area as to how laws can and will be enforced. In the end don't evade taxes or do illegal shit and shouldn't have to worry about getting in trouble. 
* Senate hearings are going good with a positive outlook and understanding of crypto currencies. 
* while some banks are more positive (bmo) , many are not. 
* everyone's friendly. 
* biggest international turn out of speakers and possibly guests? 
* CAVirtex offers instantly reload able ATM cards that work at all merchants that support interact. 
* Dark Market, a blockchain hosted exchange is on its way. Good luck trying to shut it down. 
* Some interesting ideas on dealing with the blockchain anonymity , ie get rid of history all together and just track the current values with a historic signed hash.

I would love to see how you came up with that 85% figure.. 
Even a rough of stat would impress me..

Based on your descriptions, the judges treated your and evaluated your app like a user would.  They saw it, said oh it's another one of these and moved on. 
Frankly I don't blame them, since this points to a failure on the devs to retain and differentiate to the user upon entry.

I've always been under the impression that Apple has been blocking wallet apps particularly to avoid any sort of liability with lost or stolen coins.

Hmm friend of friend knows Dorian and you're on r/bitcoin...  
Yup confirms it, he is the Satoshi.

The fact that people are using bitcoin banks, when bitcoins were a means to get away from the banking system baffles me. 
Honestly what are people who use these services thinking? 
@_date: 2014-03-01 19:50:57
So how are they using the bitcoins to get food, supplies etc?
@_date: 2014-04-13 04:48:28
Side chains are meant to run parallel to bitcoin.  They don't affect core bitcoin processes but leverage the value, and network for there own specific tasks, by using bitcoins as io's that mark entry into and out of side chains.

Reading this reminds me a lot of what Richard Stallman has been ranting about for ages, regarding cloud and Web services in general. 
Truth is same can be said about email, and vpn, these are all services we could run ourselves locally, but if services make it possible to do these things more easily, then they serve a purpose and will always be around. 
There isn't a need with fiat cash, you can just as easily secure your own money in vaults set up in your house.  That said I'm sure for some people it's just easier and something less to think about when using a bank. 
Use what works for you. Don't let the banks, or the libertarians tell you what you should be doing. If you're more comfortable using Web mail, Dropbox's, coin base or blockchain.info more power to you. If you're more comfortable running your own Web servers, running your own email servers and maintaining your own Web wallets, God bless you and keep it up. End of the day, choices and options are wonderful things!

In particular I was referring to Andreas Antonopoulos who from my understanding is the the Chief Security Officer. 
Ben Reeves is the CEO, however the his main prominence is the site itself. 
I do agree that they could add further transparency by having a team page on there site though. 
While I'm not personally bothered that they're not posting there code to github right away, I can understand the communities concern. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 15:35:36
I appreciate your thoughtful response.
Is there a reason you see that these people would favour a service such as this over something like Blockchain.info?

From what I've gathered from there brief talk about the project is, he's not so much as building an exchange as much as he's building a network where users post there wares, have ratings and then include how to get paid directly.

Wouldn't bitcoin gain by integrating in native stealth address code into there core? 
The code has already been written and vetted in some of the alts such as vertcoin, which themselves forked from the bitcoin core, so shouldn't be hard to merge back in. 
Realizing bitcoin has more to lose with a feature done wrong, it would seem to make sense though to bring across improvements made in the alt coin universe after they've been vetted.

I'd say paper wallets are great for large sums.. 
Create an encrypted paper wallet, print it and carry a copy in your wallet.. Now you have a portable paper wallet

If it's that hard for a legit company to get up and going to accept the most popular form of payment in a country, I can only imagine how hard it would be in those same places for someone to get bitcoin easily and affordably.

The bounce may have happened but we're still in a bear channel for the for-seeble month. 
Also while we want to attribute FUD to all the dips and some great innovation to all the rises they're not always as 1:1
For instance:
Also, the fact that many good TA's predicated a potential drop to 7900-8300 range in December, before any FUD in January makes one wonder if there may be some method to this madness.
