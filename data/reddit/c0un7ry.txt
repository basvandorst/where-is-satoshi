You guys support an institution that was the leading cause of death in the 20th century. 
The one that ruins lives because some dared to consume a forbidden plant. 
That wages war all over the world, killing thousands of innocent people and displacing millions. 
The same one that is bought and paid for by corporations and lobbyists. That makes laws to oppress citizens but support the established corporations.
The same institution which spies on it's own citizens. Then it uses the information it gets from its spying to attempt to silence political opponents and dissenters, like those who dared to demand being treated as equals in spite of their skin color. 
Which locks people up  for years without any due process. During that time subjecting them to torture.
The one whose officers of law continue to beat, imprison, and kill innocent people, often without facing sufficient consequences.
All of this, only scratching the surface of what atrocities have been committed by government's throughout the world.
However, we are the irrational ones, because we don't think they are needed to lay down a flat piece of concrete for us to drive on or something.

Yeah, because I can really be compared to multi-million/billion dollar corporation. Cause we all have teams of lawyers who can find backdoors and loopholes to get us out of paying taxes "legally". Maybe you do, but most of us do not.
When people stop paying taxes, and the government finds out, they are fined and/or arrested (by men with guns) then put in prison (which is guarded by men with guns). While the fine seems nice and non-violent, weigh the option. Either they pay the fine (taxes) or get imprisoned (once again we see men with guns). Thats how it works for normal ass people and not corporations.

Stop paying your taxes and then tell me there is no gun pointed at you.
