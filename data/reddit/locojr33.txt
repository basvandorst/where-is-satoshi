I would be apprehensive of such an arrangement... solely for the what if of what happens if there’s a power surge or anything that messes up the equipment... furthermore, what happens if it’s decided that the miner was the cause for power trouble. Not a likely scenario but still something to consider. If you’re going to be clear of any liability in case something does malfunction, I’d say why not.

You can buy a fraction of any coin, price will depend on current valuations

In my reading, if you hold for at least a year, it falls into long term, which is taxed at a different rate... one thing to consider is how smart it is to let sit for a year plus, could grow exponentially or it could plummet... who knows.

I bought the big 3 when I was focusing on buying, I don’t know enough about many alts available to buy into...  my focus now is mining though

Considering you’re 17 and have a ton of time to live, learn, and mess up, now is the best time to try something new... if  I were you, I wouldn’t invest everything, just what you’re comfortable losing.

Idk if that’s a stock photo or actually the person you’re speaking of, but everything about his face says douchebag and “punch me”

Just to be on the safe side, when you withdraw profits from sales of btc, put aside 25-35% of profits to the side for taxes every time you sale any, this way when the tax man cometh, you’ll already have his cut ready. Also depending on how long you’ve held, your investment might fall into long term capital gains tax...

I woke up and saw that price.. crazy

You’ll see the gains, as long as the transaction went through.

I’m not sure enough to give an absolute answer but I’d imagine that’s how it works.

I have this argument with myself since I mine... haven’t been mining long at all, just got started actually... but what I’ve noticed:
Before I even started mining, I made a small purchase of the big 3, this purchase still isn’t reflected in my account 
Flip side, in the amount of time that I’ve mined, I’ve been able to make almost instant transfers from mining site to wallet. 
I like being able to withdraw profits daily, current strategy is to let gains sit and continue to grow and withdraw monthly.
