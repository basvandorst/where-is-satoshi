[Just a curious fact: The Titanic wasn't actually referred to as unsinkable until after it sank.](

So I see Bitcoin is supposed to rise a lot today. I never bought one but it seems like a good time. I just don't want to miss out on the growth, so what is the fastest way for a non-us guy to buy bitcoins?
EDIT: Preferably with a credit card or debit card.

It may be Dragon's Tale. [Here is a google search in the time-range you specified.](

Dude, don't put ALL of your savings. Save a little bit. If you are absolutely certain its gonna keep rising, at least keep 100 bucks and put them in a bank account. Those could save your life one-day.

Are you just assuming that about localbitcoin? Because if so, give it a try. I'm in freakin' Montevideo, Uruguay and there were dealers available. I was able to even do it through paypal which is supposed to be non-viable for Bitcoins.
If not, during my research today, I found Virwox.com. There, you can add funds with your paypal or credit card, and then change them to Bitcoins pretty fast.

Through some google searching, I found some possible places:
localbitcoins.com

So that pretty much means I'm fucked right? I mean, nobody will buy it now that its so much lower.
I don't really understand the system yet, I'm new at this.

Okay so I just bought 20 dollars worth of bitcoins via LocalBitcoin. They are now in my LocalBitcoin wallet. Should I just keep them there, or do I have to send them to some address or something? I don't quite understand the system yet.

I think if we go past 1000, we should start using the term mBC (as in milibitcoins) or something of the sort. It just feels nicer to be speaking of a 50 mBC transaction than a 0.05 bitcoin transaction.

You mean in an online game?
