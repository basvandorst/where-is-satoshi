Based on anecdotal evidence, and my own personal experience, transactions were SLIGHTLY slower. I'm not sure  but every transaction felt like they were done that time when there was only a block solved every 35 minutes. Not a huge deal. Obviously for this test to work, they need to increase their tips. The misconception they had, I think, was that they were doing the standard tip, so it was fine. Except the standard tip is generally applied to much smaller transactions, and miners prioritize transactions based on a tip/kb basis. Their transactions were intentionally large, so their tip/kb came out to much less than the typical transaction. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong. (PM is fine too, if you don't want to give them advice on how to do it better)

That is correct, I was using a colloquial phrase without thinking. Its only before and during.

That's the discussion I was hoping to start- Bitcoin was in the Wall Street Journal (a few days ago) and there was a spike. I certainly wouldn't jump to saying it "caused" the spike, but it is logical that increased coverage leads to increased interest, which leads to price spikes. Yet, why not today?

While I don't necessarily buy the "willy bot" as the explanation, if memory serves, your statement just isn't true: Mt. Gox rose higher than any other exchange, and it was arguably the market setter at the time.
