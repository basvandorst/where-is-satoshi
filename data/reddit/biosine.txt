@_date: 2017-09-13 04:40:53
Where do you buy yours from?
@_date: 2017-09-18 07:46:57
Can you explain how we could lose money in more detail? I’m confused by all this. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:27:07

You know what altcoins by chance?
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:29:02

Gold has replay protection right?
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:38:52
I’m not OP
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:05:08
Idk about why some people think that type of growth is healthy. Tbh I can’t see it going over 20k in 5-10 years. I would love it to. I’d have no college loans to worry about. But I don’t think it will. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:25:15
A prepaid Visa...?
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:23:15
No they don’t. I’ve tried
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:35:04
The fork happened right? How do we access our btg 
@_date: 2017-10-04 19:05:16
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:20:18

@_date: 2017-09-30 15:46:33
Does running a node effect a computers performance or functionality?
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:23:52
@_date: 2017-10-17 18:08:48

@_date: 2017-10-26 18:11:29

@_date: 2017-10-17 15:43:44
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:03:14
Where do you trade on?
@_date: 2017-10-20 04:57:50
If I have my BTC in electrum or my Ledger Nano S will I still get my BTC2x shitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:12:24
Thankyou. I couldn’t find the app for GDAX
@_date: 2017-10-16 23:52:19
Ledger Nano S gives you fork coins?
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:00:47
