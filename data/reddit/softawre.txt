Bitcoin mining is done by specialized hardware these days.  If you just have a regular GPU you probably want to mine other coins (and convert to BTC if you want).  Start here:

Amazon would use a company that would immediately transfer their bitcoin into fiat.

If you have enough to retire, why don't you retire?  I am getting close to retirement money in my 401k/post-tax-accounts, bet your ass I'll stop working when that happens.
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:25:58
(that's the joke)
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:58:11
what decentralized exchanges?  the ones with all of the centralized integration points to fiat?
@_date: 2019-07-28 18:57:28
Not really. This is what smart people do to guarantee a nice retirement. I probably own more Bitcoin than the average user here, but it's only about 8% of my net worth.
@_date: 2018-09-19 14:45:37
cars are a worse investment than crypto on a bad day

The DOW might go to 50k and BTC might crash to 50$.  If it was predictable which way it was going to go then you'd be out making millions.

You're being kind.  Of course he doesn't really know jack.

Guys, we have to accept that some people are incapable of self reflection.  At least he tried.  
@_date: 2018-09-20 04:57:34
even at 50 doge thats....25 cents a day?  
@_date: 2018-09-19 14:44:03
you can buy video games at indiegala in btc (and get 30% off for doing so). 
@_date: 2018-08-09 01:48:35
I just got a 25% discount at IndieGala buying some games simply for buying with BTC.  It was super easy to do.  
@_date: 2018-08-22 14:44:13
so you're saving for a house in crypto?
@_date: 2018-08-28 16:16:18
I think most of the investors here who have a decent amount of BTC are semi-wealthy people just diversifying their holdings.  I have about 7% of my net worth in BTC just in case it does skyrocket (or USD tanks), and if BTC crashes then I'll still be fine.   
@_date: 2018-08-22 14:50:02
There is if you just want exposure to the market.  Say I have 500k in a retirement account in fiat, and I want to hedge against BTC becoming huge in the next 5 years, I may buy 25k of BTC on Coinbase and keep it there.  
For a person like this, what is more likely - that Coinbase steals their coins, or that they lose them somehow trying to setup their own hardware wallet?  Even if it's more likely that Coinbase steals them (it isn't) - if we're talking 5% of their retirement does it matter?  
I understand purists like you, but don't use absolutist terms like "There's no point" unless you've really done your research on the use cases.  
@_date: 2018-08-28 16:23:15
If somebody is going to have &lt;1k in BTC do they really need wallet security, or can they just hold it in an exchange?  Depends what their time is worth, I guess - and maybe interest level in learning the technology.
@_date: 2018-08-23 14:23:03


No it isn't.  There are many things that could cause it go poof away, like the crypto being rendered useless, or large governments making it highly illegal, or another crypto-currency just being vastly better for some reason. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 16:18:44
So you're wealthy, have a large income, convert most of your income to bitcoin, AND spend 95% of the bitcoin you convert?  
What in the world are you spending all of that bitcoin on?

An expensive car is the worst investment you can make.

 - Apple is great at security
 - When Apple makes something, it becomes mainstream. 
@_date: 2019-03-05 21:18:09
Exactly.  I treat BTC like any other risky investment.  Good to have 1-5% of your net worth in just in case.  
@_date: 2019-11-19 17:20:56
All of those investments have a high correlation with each other. you want to diversify investments that react differently to market conditions. 
Myself, I hold about 75% stock, 15% Bitcoin, 10% bonds in my portfolio.

He said he has very low electricity costs in another thread, paying hydro prices near Canada, I think.
@_date: 2019-11-15 17:10:55
Easy. Six figures in tech is table stakes now. You can pretty easily make 200k in a low cost of living market.

It's not idiots that think it'll work, or they want free money. It's mostly that people are worried about what happens when we hit 30% unemployment because of technological advances.

For me, its a hedge.  ~5% of my overall portfolio, just in case other things tank or it goes to the moon.
@_date: 2018-10-05 17:37:09
Proof?  
@_date: 2019-03-27 20:28:40
I hedge my traditional investments by having 5% of my net worth in BTC.  I don't have to do a bunch of work to mine.  
@_date: 2018-10-02 15:48:52
sometimes people need fiat to..you know, survive?
@_date: 2018-10-19 21:59:00
Depends on how much wealth you have.  If you have a couple million bucks in retirement funds, and you want to keep around 10% of it in BTC for various reasons, then you'd have maybe around 37BTC.  
@_date: 2018-10-04 21:03:07
you are obviously much more poor than OP
@_date: 2019-03-17 02:58:12
He explained that him existing got him some extra money. His point was that was similar to basic income
@_date: 2018-10-03 23:10:07
How are you prepared
@_date: 2018-10-23 15:41:05
Good comment, this is basically what I did.  CS degree paid off, 2% cash back credit card paid off each month earning hundreds extra in cash a year, no car payments, dream house in good neighborhood with no PMI and lowish payments.  
It wasn't incredibly hard or anything, it just requires a bit of work.
@_date: 2018-10-17 17:14:52
Exactly.  
Also most wealthy people don't flaunt it.  
@_date: 2018-10-04 21:04:56
yeah, most of us can do basic math in our heads..
@_date: 2019-03-23 20:38:29
Agreed. I think spending more than 20 or 25k on a deprecating asset like a car is too much unless you are a millionaire

Anybody with any real amount of money that could push Bitcoin valuations up is not losing a large amount to inflation relative to their net worth.
@_date: 2018-10-02 15:50:44
You're still not understanding though.  You have BTC, you spend BTC.  It doesn't matter how much you bought it for.
@_date: 2019-08-12 15:43:34
having fuck you money.  enough for you and your kids to retire and have fun forever.

So if you bought via coinbase and transferred it to a private wallet, the IRS would send a letter? I've done this and I didn't get a letter.

How will the zombies use it as a currency if people like you that already have someone even use it as a currency?

Obviously they don't want to create too much money as they want to keep inflation in check. But they do create money out of nowhere. 
If you really want to learn, I recommend starting from the beginning with the money for the rest of us podcast.

assuming your half a coin is only like &lt;5% of your total investment portfolio I think you just hold just in case, that's what I am doing, b/c why not.
If it's more than that - you should sell, and shouldn't have bought that much to begin with
@_date: 2018-11-28 20:39:56
not really, you can always buy back the same amount of BTC you just spent.  (yes, which defeats the point of BTC as a currency, but it's how I do it)
@_date: 2019-01-29 20:39:46


Yeah but once you need to turn it into cash you have to go to an exchange anyway, right?  So having your "own keys" doesn't really do anything here.

It's probably the opposite of what you are saying here, because of cost-basis as you mention.  Lower cost basis means you're paying much more in taxes.

Hi, fellow Indiana person.
Right ballpark, maybe - depending on your mortgage rate and your faith in the market.
My mortgage is 3.7 APY.  I am earning more than that on average in an index fund.  So while I do pay extra on my mortgage, I don't try to pay it off immediately - rather I put money into index funds and it works out better.  
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:27:42

There's no correlation but there's definitely causation there.  The rich people I know are fairly smart people.  
Yes, with BTC there is a lot of luck, but working in tech and saving money, or starting a business - you know the way most people get rich - being smart and hard working makes those a hell of a lot easier.
@_date: 2018-12-14 19:51:33
The other use case, the one that I use, is basic spreading of assets across different types of things.  I had already had my money in stocks, bonds, real estate - it just makes sense to take maybe 3% of my portfolio and put it into BTC just in case the dollar or the market crashes or BTC goes to the moon.  Just basic investment strategy.
