This still in reality doesn’t do much until we have blocks full of segwit only transactions which could take a few more years

Because of that I subscribed to both subreddits

Oh no! Someone who supports something you don’t decided to help the project with his money by providing a few nodes that happen to run on aws instead of any other vps provider. What an evil person.

Why would you say 2X is a scam? No one wants to loose money and “bring down bitcoin” or some shit like that. 2X is a block size upper limit upgrade (part 2 of the NYA with part 1 being segwit which no one complained about) to get more transactions into a block if needed, to then make mining more rewarding and transactions go through faster. Core could do it too but they decided not to. 
A counter argument would be: why does core have authority over bitcoin? I personally think this fork is good. It will show which version will get more support as a decentralized decision. 
I will continue buying bitcoin and don’t care which version it is. If transactions go through faster I’m going to be more happy. But I also understand why miners want 2X as they are the people who invest a ton of money into running mining equipment.

That’s precisely it. I unsubscribed from both subs because of how biased they are. It’s impossible to have a reasonable discussion without people shouting “bad actors with deep pockets” or some shit like that

All culture aside (don’t know enough about both sides), having a 2X upgrade sounds nice especially if the user base grows in the future (ignoring lightning). Plus if block rewards half more, having bigger blocks with more transactions would be pretty sweet for miners to keep their stuff running.

I am very happy to own a ledger. Way to go! Very objective way to treat the fork with a great explanation. I prefer this way over what trezor does

What incentive would a normal person have to run a node nonstop? 
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:11:31
My view is: Satoshi is gone. It doesn’t matter what he said years ago because today is not then. This is a decentralized project and that’s how it should be treated: without a leader.

Yet the most recent hard fork flew through without any problems just a couple of days ago. I doubt most people even noticed that it happened

They have simply corrected their previous statement because of the uproar it caused from people who actually want 2X. Saying from the beginning that 2X is going to get called B2X was the un-neutral thing as it directly picks a side without giving the community a chance to decide

“I already send her pocket money in bitcoin” - and how / where can a kid spend it when even most grown ups can’t

In japan I just go to a convenience store and 10 minutes later the money is on my exchange, ready to use. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:14:32
Precisely this. I think coinbase is doing the right thing by trying to stay neutral. This sub is obviously against 2X but it doesn’t reflect all bitcoin users, and other people might prefer the 2X fork. 
I wonder why ethereum mostly doesn’t have these problems when hard forks happen (ignoring ethereum classic)

Couldn't even save a single bitcoin together yet. No 50k for me :(

I bought monacoin (alongside some other alts) at 0.9, now it's at 0.45. Tell me about it.

Not just btc. I put some money into other coins too and they also tanked

This is calming me a little down. I lost 50% of my initial investment in the past weeks. Not THAT much money so far (maybe $500 USD loss) but I still invested more than I invested into any other things previously. It's a nice initial slap in the face.
