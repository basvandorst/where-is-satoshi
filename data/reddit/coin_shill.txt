What if OP actually wants to transfer 1.8m and 180k is actually already one of many "small" transfers? Money worth is relative.
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:47:55
I still don't get it. You were browsing and suddenly you wanted to try the username call thing so you copied the first name you saw and then came to and pasted it on a random thread? Why Why this thread? How would you know if it worked if ignored it? Your account is 1 year old, why only today?!
So many questions.

This is not something you should be celebrating. The only reason fees are going down is because there are less people making transactions, not because SegWit adoption has increased. Whenever we see higher market volume the mempool will grow again.
Since 2016 there is a sequence of huge backlogs separated by periods with no backlog. During the backlogs, the fees and delays are completely unpredictable, and a large fraction of the transactions are inevitably delayed by days or weeks. During the low transactions period, there is no "fee market" because any transaction that pays the minimum fee (a few cents) gets confirmed in the next block.

Your comment history is weird as fuck too.
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:44:10
I always write SPAM in CAPS LOCK (CAPS LOCK too) for some reason. The plot thickens.
The quotation marks are meant as it's not actually SPAM, you just do it a lot.
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:36:19
Lots of one liners, single words, and subreddit "SPAM".
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:13:03
What's going on here? @_date: 2018-01-27 12:12:38
I'm not trying to be an ass, but did you look at the SegWit usage chart?
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:54:09
It it were to take this long you can be damn sure an alt will overtake.
@_date: 2018-01-27 12:07:15
You mean the constant 2 or 3 posts on the front page with exclamations points all over the place isn't celebrating?
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:48:37
"SPAM" subreddit names.
@_date: 2018-01-26 22:07:51
That chart clearly shows it's decreasing since Dec 20.
Here's the 60 days chart: 
90 days: 
SegWit usage still under 15%:

Fixed: Larger blocks ~~will be~~ **are** required ~~at some point in the future~~ **right now**

Someone please tell them to STOP spending funds after every single donation. Just look at the address, they are wasting a ton of money on fees!
They should wait until a nice sum is donated and then batch it all up.
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:41:12
It's unacceptable that we live in fear of using our own money.
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:17:20
Weisst of time.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:03:56
Obviously the block reward would have to be adjusted along with all these changes... I don't know why this needs to be said.
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:09:40
It's not an average, it's the fee required to get into the next X blocks.
You want an average and mediam? Here you go:

I think is a bot. His comment history is fucking weird.

Yeah, 18 transfers. EZPZ.

I can't find the damn quote. Maybe I'm dreaming... but I'm pretty sure I'm not.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:52:41
Guess I was wrong then :D
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:02:09
I'm waiting.
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:14:42
Network fees are higher than your balance.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:10:52
They decreased the amount has time went by. I think they were giving over 100k initially, since I got about 200k total from 2 accounts.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:32:57
I do SegWit transactions using TREZOR on daily basis. You're a **LIAR**.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:12:10
That's obviously you.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:56:48


Literally impossible. Sorry, but you're lying.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:27:48
I keep hearing about a whole lotta magical shit but no actual progress. Why is that?
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:07:48
People said the exact same thing about SegWit yet here we are. You won't see wide usage of SegWit or LN until 2021 at the absolute earliest.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:31:53


This is false. There are several comments of his on bitcointalk which he talked about pooled mining.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:09:50
lmao my comment is in the first page of that thread. I got nearly 200k ripple for free but I sold it right away for about 4 BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:25:57
 You are such a fucking liar. That transaction only confirmed becasue its child has a higher fee. It's called Child-Pays-for-Parent.
That 10 sat/B transaction was stuck until you spent the unconfirmed funds with another transaction of 374 sat/B. They were both included in the same block.
Not only are you a liar but also a scammer. You tried to fool me but I'm not an idiot.
And I'm the one with an agenda, yeah right.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:16:56
I bet you also treat people differently based on their skin color.
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:47:48
I didn't.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:08:18
Mate, I'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt here as it seems you're genuinely confused.
You can input ANY number on that form, you can set it to 1 or 0 satoshis per byte. That doesn't mean it will confirm.
I guarantee you that transaction will NEVER confirm and will be dropped from the mempool.
Fees now account for over 50% of the block reward: 
There is 0 chance that transaction will ever confirm. ZERO.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:40:13
Yeah I think that's the one I saw at the time Mike Hearn sent those emails to that guy making the archive. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:50:12
This makes no goddamn sense. Someone please give me one use-case for this.
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:34:02
I didn't even know Android wallets don't have this feature. I've always used desktop and TREZOR and it has always had this feature.
I just don't understand the upvotes here, you'd be lucky to see 1 person use this per day...
