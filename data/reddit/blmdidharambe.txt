You’re delusional if you think there’s a guarantee that it will always be something with any worth. You just said it’s a bet. If you somehow knew that it would always be “there” then it wouldn’t be a bet.

This is obviously going nowhere. It’s not simply the meme posts, it’s the entirety of the childish comments within the posts that illustrate that the majority of this community isn’t necessarily “investing” in a safe manner. Almost no one acknowledges that the entire thing could fall at any moment. The vast majority of people here are circle jerking each other and creating an aura of winning that can never fail. You might not see this, but it’s there.

They’re pretend billionaires at that point, which should tell you something about the market.
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:08:31
You know, I’ve yet to see that on one of these front page memes. It’s not what the sub is selling everyone on. They’re selling everyone on getting rich. Period.
Maybe some users are responsible and try to urge people to be responsible, but that’s not apparent.

And he’s actually contradicted himself in many spots in this thread. A fiduciary wouldn’t say shit like he says to clients.

When you think reality is fear mongering and that a sub based in facts is “leaking” when you don’t agree with the facts...you’re probably a Donald enthusiast.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:53:41
And if you’re wrong, you stand to lose everything. It’s a bet, like you said.
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:28:45
Good luck with that

If the stock market crashes, enough people will likely sell their Bitcoin that it will fold. The entire thing is built upon a sense of scarcity and people holding. If just one of the major holders sells their entire stock, the market will crash. They won’t though, because they know that, but when an entire market can hinge on one person’s actions, it’s volatile as fuck.

Just another example of people trying to artificially increase the price of BitCoin by driving hype.
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:54:29
No, it couldn’t. We’re at a time now that the actual “investment” the regular Joe’s are throwing down is big money for them. Years ago if someone had a couple hundred in Bitcoin, and it crashed, no big deal. But because of its past, people are putting down their entire savings into Bitcoin. If it crashes, they will lose everything. That’s the difference and it’s something you all seem incapable of admitting, or realizing. The hype that got you to these numbers could also be the downfall, and a downfall that wouldn’t be recovered from.
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:02:25
It’s a gamble. I see this is a bubble that will eventually burst and never recover. The fact that this sub exists, and is in the state that it is, should tell you something. Would you trust these people with your money? I, for one, wouldn’t.
Or it could keep on keeping on and become the new world currency. But I highly doubt that. This seems like a fad more than anything, and when it inevitably crashes, I just can’t fathom it recovering. Too many people will be burned in such a way that they will not be able to recover. A lot of people “investing” in bitcoin are putting almost all of their money into it because they see others making insane amounts of money. Problem is, when it crashes hard, a lot of people will be left with absolutely nothing. At that point the hype train will be gone, and it will never return, because of the crash. That’s my theory at least. Everyone here will disagree with it though, because they’re not legitimate investors and they didn’t diversify worth shit, and this idea scares the living shit out of them.
Edit: Also, the stock market is likely going to take a fucking nosedive if the tax bill passes. It’s a complete repeat of the 1920’s leading into the Great Depression. If that happens, Bitcoin will fold.
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:05:06
Taxes aren’t reduced in the way you’re imagining. Seriously, compare this to the shit that went down in the 1920’s. It’s freakishly similar, and we cannot expect something different to happen this time around, especially given the fact that the market is so artificially pumped up right now. It’s not going to be good.
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:51:15
This is the problem. You all are treating this as an equal, or actually a lesser comparison, to trends in the past. Percentages are not all that matter here. When people without great savings have a ton of money on the line, it doesn’t matter if trends when it was near worthless (compared to now) show one thing. The game has changed.
@_date: 2018-08-28 06:01:42
Lol, let us know how you feel when it hits $1k.
@_date: 2018-08-28 06:03:23
@_date: 2018-08-28 06:02:31
That’s one of the dumbest statements I’ve ever read regarding markets.
@_date: 2017-08-13 10:47:54
I was simply explaining to you why most people you know don't own any.
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:02:33
It's hard for people to justify investing in almost anything that was 1/4000 of its value less than a decade ago.
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:22:01
Are you trying to show that it could easily hit rock bottom for a long time span before skyrocketing again? Because that’s what I see in this comparison, except that if Bitcoin crashes to the bottom, it’s not going to recover, faith in it will be lost.
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:00:47
Sorry but people shouldn’t take investing advice from anyone who doesn’t understand the difference between passed and past.
@_date: 2018-02-17 12:18:23
The problem with BTC right now, as a currency, is that for a business to accept it and not be taking a risk, they must immediately convert it to another currency. That makes the entire premise of it as a currency really fucking stupid.
