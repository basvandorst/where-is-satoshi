Thanks, do you have any recommendations of traders?

Very true, think I might just do that. Just wanted to see if there was anyway to build on what I already have :)

But again you're missing the point, it's silly in itself to decide to join a community so actively against you. Its constant. If you were insulted on a daily basis based on your gender and told repeatedly you weren't adept enough, its pretty fucking grating. Its not something that people even get offended about anymore because its always present. I wouldn't want to get attacked in real life and then again online. **Age** isnt the same as gender by any means.
Sexism isn't just something to look over if you really wanted women to join in, in the tech world.

Looking at developed countries who are actually going to be inclined to use bitcoin, the population is [equal.] (
@_date: 2015-12-10 02:19:35
Pretty much in my opinion. A lot of bitcoin is catered towards males, its only logical therefore that more males are going to use it. 
But then again, even on this thread you've got males bashing females saying they're too simple minded to use it, so I don't even know why they're asking the question. Stop the abuse and stereotypes and maybe more people would be inclined to use it.

Do you mean like as in the appeal of whole big numbers? As in 1btc being considered in a higher number eg 100, to make people think they're getting more?

It's more the community that disheartens women from diving in. Saying that all women aren't into computers, not risk takers, or even that women aren't evolutionary adapt and are simple minded, which has all been posted on this thread, makes the aspect of bitcoin less appealing. Why join an environment that go against you, just for being a different gender? 
Not all people are dicks, but for the few that are, it definitely doesn't motivate you to explore bitcoin at all.

1. Might as well use normal currency. A lot of easy access products like games are catered to a male audience = less females interested.
2. Considered a hassle to exchange it to a currency, a lot of people, men and women I've found, generally think trading is something scary and only professionals can do it to get a good price.
3. General lack of knowledge. My teacher was telling us that 28,000 bitcoin was around £250,000, I nearly laughed in her face. Some also think it's taboo with how it's being used for terrorism and literally think they'll get arrested if they touch it. There's also the issue of people not knowing how to get bitcoin in the first place, thinking that the only way is to mine. Moreover, it's still considered where I'm from to not be a legitimate currency and a lot of people who use it are considered geeky. 
4. Leading on from the last point. Get picked on. This is true guys too, one person I know gets pick on by guys thinking he's a try hard to be cool and edgy. It's up there with pretending to code on command prompt. Girls think this too, but are way more bitchy about it. There is still the stigma that girls can't be computer savvy, bitcoin comes under this.
Obviously this doesn't mean for every girl but I think these are just basic thoughts. 
Sorry for the poor writing, too tired to correct it right now.

I see what you mean, but I feel like it's also down to people not really knowing what value Bitcoin has, or even is. If more people were educated and saw a Bitcoins worth on the market they would be more interested. There's also the issue of Bitcoin being so volatile. 100 one day could turn into 10 the next, like 2013. Also the majority of Bitcoin purchases are big, with the whole black market stigma, so for those main transactions the value is around the 100's. 
I do get where you're coming from though definitely, I just don't think Bitcoins in the position to change like that; in many ways it's still a niche for the general population.
