Back when CPUs reigned king, Satoshi himself outlined a super secure, self-reinforcing system seldom implemented correctly called merged mining.
If you haven't heard of em, Verus is actually still rather profitable for CPUs and many people in their community actually do mine on their laptops, the lead dev is a former VP at Microsoft and they designed their own 51% immune algo that equalizes hashrates across hardware types meaning right now they have CPUs competitively mining on the same network as FPGAs!
The big news that miners may be interested in is the concept of Merged Mining, predicted to be the future of mining by Satoshi himself (his/her post about it is in the article), this is a grouping of info related to a live testnet for a planned full scale, few clicks, multi-chain creation ecosystem.
Merged Mined projects offer unique reward potentials and should be of particular interest to miners, pools, and exchanges alike. (PBaaS now allows miners to mine or stake up to 15 coins all simultaneously and at no additional energy cost)

Verus and the Verus Coin project are community driven, all open source ( and they are also now currently running a test net of their all new protocol, PBaaS (Public Blockchain as a Service) with merged mining of up to 15 (including Verus) fully independent, secure, scalable chains that all share the properties of the parent chain.
This is an overview of their new PBaaS with merged mining-
