I don't follow your reasoning. Why would anyone sell a bitcoin miner which is guaranteed to mine bitcoins?
It is possible for an ASIC run and never generate a coin, ever. Much like a shovel.
The difficulty may become so hard your ASIC cannot hash fast enough to be worthwhile. Much like a shovel.
There may not anything left to mine. Much like a shovel.
By the time you finally get your ASIC Bitcoins may not be worth the energy and capital much like any mined metal.
Why would any reasonable person sell a machine guaranteed to make a quick profit?
BTC could crash below $1 tomorrow. Would your ASIC be worth anything when you finally get it?

Bitcoin is based off HashCash which in essence is incrementing a number till the first n bits are 0.
Bitcoin uses SHA-256 which is a cryptographically secure hash function which by definition it is computationally infeasible to generate M for a given H(M). It is also computationally infeasible to find M,N where H(M) = H(N)
Even if you did 2^256 iterations of SHA-256 you are not guaranteed to have 2^256 unique outputs.
Thus your ASIC may never find a hash which means bitcoins hashcash-esq requirements. It is very unlikely if the difficulty is easy and static. But it is possible^ that tomorrow the difficulty is so high you never find a coin or even all coins are mined.
^notice I never said probably
Hey it's even possible by the time (if ever) you get your ASIC no one is using BitCoin anymore.
These are possibilities, I never attached a probability to them. You said guarantee which means a probability of 1.
Put another way it is possible for me to mine all the coins left in &lt;1s on my laptop. Negligibly probably but possible.
A reasonable person would not call a box you plug into your wall that more to run than you earn an income. Advertising like this is misleading.
It does not even guarantee your coins are worth anything.
I could sell you a pack of carrot seeds, advertising this as a guaranteed income is misleading at best.
BitCoin is a speculators market which I assume you know a lot about, statistical analysis gives evidence of a ponzi scheme.
Maybe not pragmatically but the result is no different.
BitCoin is not anonymous, every transaction is public which makes it pseudononymous. Link one transaction to a person and every transaction ever made is linked.
Mixers and other fluff just increase the difficulty of analysis but not enough to bother even an entry level statsition.
Transaction fees exist both in the system and with payment processors.
There are laws about holding and transferring large amounts of money but I'm sure you will just reply with "BitCoin is not a currency it is a digital good".
If BitCoin was the only currency we would see an income gap far greater than that of USA.
By promoting BitCoin you are bringing new players to the game and well... that's good... for ~~you~~ sum.

Visa and MC charge me 1.1% for each transaction.
I thought BitCoin had no fees?

But later you say:




If something is guaranteed it has there is no risk.


And your true colours are now revealed.
**Just admit buying one of these ASICs is *not* guaranteed to make you a profit.**

neither does this

It is charged in USD, your bank does conversion for you the buyer.

I wrote a really long reply but hit backspace and bamn it was gone. Why must browsers use backspace when input is not focused as a back key?
TL;not writing again 1.1% is for transactions usually &lt;$10
Non-profit I direct: 30c per transaction for transactions usually &gt;$20 and regularly &gt;$100
2 or 3 cases fraud with charity, easy to refund, not a big deal.
Business see small amount of fraudulent purchases, goods are digital not a big deal as easy to refund.
Just because the payment system doesn't have chargebacks as a feature doesn't mean you are not morally and legally obligated to return the money to it's rightful owner.
e-Gold had no chargebacks...
