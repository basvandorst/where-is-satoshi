@_date: 2018-01-14 06:24:53
A lot of people said the same thing when it rose to $10.  Then $100.  Then $500.  At $1000, people swore up and down it couldn’t go any higher.  Here we are a year later.  You don’t think we got here in a straight line, do you?
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:26:44

While this seemed interesting, I just checked the app and noticed two things.  
1.	There isn’t any way to move the BTC you buy.  In fact, the only thing that you can do with it is sell it.  Or buy more.  If you can’t move it to your own hardware wallet, what’s the point in getting any BTC other than to daytrade it?
2.	The price chart is useless.  All it shows you is a average price curve without any lines, nor any high low info.  
This is not gonna replace Coinbase anytime soon.

There’s no risk - money or time - to switch when you were on MySpace.  If Facebook didn’t work out, you could go right back to MySpace.  In fact, you could use both simultaneously.
There’s a lot of risk switching in cryptos.  You have to sell one in order to move to another, or sacrifice future purchases in one for another.  Both move entails risk.  And if Bitcoin continues to be the most widely accepted and recognized coin, most people will not take that risk.

The US isn’t the only market for Bitcoin.  It’s not the largest market.  It’s not even the second or third largest.  
I don’t think it will jump higher forever.  But the gold market cap is over $8 trillion.  Bitcoin is only at $250 billion.  Conservatively, it will be able to get to $800 billion which is 10% of gold’s market cap.  Best case scenario?  It surpasses gold.  
As for “dropping off”, please.  It’s been what, 3 weeks?  Bitcoin has been around for almost 10 years.  You know how many people keep calling out Bitcoin’s death every time it “dropped off”, for far longer than the current 3 weeks.  I expect it may even stay in this zone for months.
The only people it’s dropped off for are the people who only started buying in the week before Christmas.

No it doesn’t.  Purchasing power of domestic goods remains the same.  Purchasing power of imported goods decreases (they get more expensive).  Domestic prices become more “competitive” because of others rising prices, not because theirs become cheaper.

It was sort of a bittersweet coincidence that Hal passed away because then it leaves room for the possibility that Satoshi is dead.  I don't think he is.

You can’t directly short Bitcoin.  Where are you going to borrow Bitcoins to sell?
And if you’re talking about dumping enough to drive down the market, that means you would have had to buy up enough to drive up the market. So you just end up right back where you started.  And if you actually do drive the market up, you risk more people piling in and driving it so high that you go bankrupt.  
All that’s moot anyhow.  No one with that kind of money would be stupid enough to risk that much of their money.  Bitcoin market cap is too big for anyone but Warren Buffet and Jeff Bezos to manipulate.

Part of investing is putting money into something with potential -  *before* it becomes reality.  By the time it becomes reality, you're too late.  I'm sure you've been waiting awhile for Lightning, but 1.0 RC got released last week, which means it really is very close now.  I'd expect first half of 2018. 
The TPS is not what compels people to buy it though.  Look around.  Even though it's rare, you can find merchants who accept Bitcoin.  A lot fewer that accept Litecoin.  Even fewer that accept Ether.  All the others are nearly nonexistent.  What use is 50,000 TPS if you can't find a business to accept it?  It might as well be 1 TPS.  
Current technological superiority is not a guarantee of success.  This has been shown over and over throughout all of history.  Yet, people still make the mistake in concluding that that's the only measure (or at least most important one) of what to invest in.  I suppose because it is objective, concrete, and quantifiable.  But that's only part of the equation.  The other part (and I would argue the bigger part) is mass psychology.  And that has to do a lot with social acceptance - "what do other people have and use"?
When Google+ came out, I tried like hell to convince my family and friends to set up accounts there.  From my point of view, it was more elegant, more user friendly, and faster than Facebook.  Plus, everyone I tried to convince already had GMail accounts.  I thought it was a no-brainer.  Turns out, being entangled in the social network that is Facebook is a HUGE HUGE disincentive to leave.  I myself eventually had to go back to Facebook because it got awfully lonely on Google+.  I still have my account there but I don't remember the last time I checked it.  Same thing happened to the few handful of people I knew who were on there.

This article underscores the primary reason that I am moving a significant amount of money into Bitcoin.  The tax cuts that were just passed by Congress was one of the dumbest monetary policies ever passed and I believe will precipitate massive inflation in the US that will be compounded though not caused by Bitcoin.  Of course, the GOP members responsible for this disaster of a bill will pin the blame on Bitcoin and the people who bought it.

@_date: 2017-12-14 01:52:31
Think of cash.  You can pay cash to someone else without middlemen too.  But you need a bank to first obtain the cash.  Or for someone else to pay you cash.  
Bitcoin is the same way but better than cash because you can store it securely online yourself without needing to take it back to a bank for safe keeping.  
IOW, once you get the Bitcoin from Coinbase into your own wallet, you don’t need them anymore unless you want to convert it back to USD.

Do you understand that socialism isn’t an all or nothing proposition?  You can have a capitalist society with socialized aspects, particularly education and healthcare.  No one but extreme leftists are arguing that everything should be socialized.  
Socialism wasn’t why Venezuela went to shit.  They fell apart because of a combination of an oil price collapse, incompetent government, and corrupt businessmen.  Does that sound at all familiar?  If you didn’t know this, it means you have read absolutely nothing about Venezuela.  And yet somewhere in that head of yours, you decided you knew exactly what caused it? 
If you’re going to make the simple minded argument that socialism was the reason for their collapse, then why are countries like Canada, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway doing just great with extensive socialist policies.  
Uninformed armchair “analysis” of complex system failures made by people who have clearly never even set foot outside the US make me want to scream in disgust.  This is proof of how shitty our education has become and how complacent our country is.

I’m sure it’s partly that but also, Litecoin was designed to be 1/4 of Bitcoin’s value.  It will have a max of 84 million (vs 21 million Bitcoin).  So if you extrapolate and believe that Bitcoin is worth its current price of $17k, Litecoin *should* be at $4.25k.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:49:26
Is LN development being hindered by lack of money though?  If it’s simply a matter of sufficient testing, simply throwing more money at it won’t do much.

I guess this is where your point of view all depends on the analogy you pick.  I would argue that this nothing like a pager vs iPhone since Bitcoin can be improved/upgraded to be as good/useful if not better than [insert currently technologically superior blockchain], and a pager can never be upgraded to be as good or useful as an iPhone.  The same applies to all the other technological creations that you listed.  In fact, you could argue that Blu-Ray is merely an upgraded version of DVD, which was an upgraded version of LaserDisc.  Streaming was the true "superior" technology *because* it was a paradigm shift.  I don't see any of the other non-Bitcoin cryptos being paradigm shifts.  If the talking heads at CNBC start talking about Monero, ZCash, IOTA, Dogecoin on a daily basis, I'll consider changing my mind.  If any of them start showing up on my Reddit front page, I'll start considering the possibility.  But until then, nope.  
As an aside, I distinctly remember being on AVSForum when people were complaining loudly about Apple not building Blu-Ray into their Macs or AppleTV.  I posted that streaming was going to supplant Blu-Ray because the convenience outweighed decreased audio/video quality.  I have never been so angrily rebuked for my point of view.  Not even here on Reddit.  That's because most technophiles only assess technology by quantifiable factors.  But they ignore the fact that 99.999% of the population doesn't give a shit.  I believe that Lightning and Rootstock will make the public not give a shit about the other coins.  Some will continue to exist - probably Litecoin and Ether.  But most will simply fade away from lack of use.  Great technology is useless if the masses don't latch on.  
Then there is the added benefit of history.  Bitcoin has been around for longer than everyone else.  There's the assurance that in spite of its high market valuation - it has never been hacked.  The same cannot be said of any number of "other" cryptos (see Tether for the latest example).  I would argue that peace of mind is another important factor.  
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:29:43
Fully agree.  However, it would have done a lot for public perception if the CEO hadn’t dismissed it recently as if it were unimportant. Timing and momentum are critical to Bitcoin’s success.  A lot of people who brought their money into Bitcoin are likewise going to leave if transaction times take too long and cost too much.
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:08:26
It has to get to a certain point where the price is stabilized for it to become a currency (and for Lightning Network to work flawlessly).  Just because it isn’t doesn’t mean it won’t.  It can’t keep going up forever.  To some people that means it will crash.  But I think it will eventually just plateau when it reaches “equilibrium”.  From there, it’ll continue to increase but at a much slower rate.  That’s when it’ll become viable as an everyday currency.

Someone help me understand SegWit better.  What I understand so far is that SegWit was implemented into the Bitcoin blockchain code in August.  
However, in order to take advantage of it, my wallet itself needs to be compatible with the code?  
What about if I transfer BTC?  Do both wallets need SegWit compatibility?  So then why do I read about people complaining that Coinbase hasn’t implemented SegWit compatibility yet?  Once you transfer to coins to your own wallet, isn’t Coinbase irrelevant?
Also, I’m still trying to understand the underlying tech of SegWit, but as an end user, why do I care?  How does it help me?  Faster confirmation times? Lower fees?  Or is it just that it sets it up for Lightning?
On a technical level, why is it needed for Lightning?  Is it the code that allows for level 2 “apps” (is that the right term?)?
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:49:30
Imagine Bitcoin as a city.   Now imagine the blockchain as a highway.  Right now in Bitcoin, there’s a single highway.  It does connect you to everything, but you always have to use it to get from point A to point B.  Even if it’s just to a coffee shop two blocks away. The problem is that it’s quite congested and the fee to use it can be high.  So there’s very little motivation to ever go anywhere.
Lightning Networks would be a teleportation device that gets you anywhere in the city instantly for pennies.

Relax.  It’s a derivative.  These people are betting on the price of Bitcoin.  They can’t actually short it unless they buy up massive sums and pray that they can sell it off and cause the market to drop lower (that’s not really shorting).  But there’s always another person on the other side of the bet who could just easily buy up even more and basically squeeze the living shit out of the person trying to to dive it down.  
Let them play their little games.  Focus on the long term.  Bitcoin will continue its march upwards as more and more people become interested.  Anyone shorting it is a massive moron and deserves to lose their shorts.  Pun intended.

Re: Lightning Network, yes.  Much faster (seconds) and much cheaper (cents).  A credit card charges 2-3% and you have to wait until the end of a month cycle to actually receive the money from the processor.  Sure, in the next few years, most people have credit cards and most people don’t have Bitcoin wallets.  But when that changes, what’s the incentive for a merchant to take credit cards?
Re: potential.  Can you name any investment that’s a guarantee?  From my experience, it seems that the level of doubt from an individual about Bitcoin is inversely related to how much they know about how it works and the implications.  You admit you don’t understand Bitcoin all that well.  But you’ve concluded that there’s no proof it will succeed?  Do yourself a favor and delve into it.  Google and YouTube are all that you need.

I like your sense of style.  It definitely looks cool, but I have to agree that it needs to have easier recognizability like the Nike and Apple logos.  From a distance, it looks too much like a grid.  
(Side note: the Apple logo has a bite in it because without it, the logo designer felt it looked too much like a cherry.)
I will say that I agree the current logo could use a bit of a fresher look.  I hope you take these posts as constructive and keep at it.  Very few people hit success with their first attempt.
Edit: I also wanted to add that you don’t necessarily have to go with a wordless logo like Apple or Nike.  There are lots of successful brands that incorporate the name itself into the logo.  Amazon, EBay, Google, etc.  Most notably and relevant to Bitcoin, Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover all use their name in their logo.

The problem with analogies is that if you choose the a flawed one, you can project incorrect characteristics onto the thing you’re trying to compare.  A lot of people are saying “bubble” which gives the impression of something popping and becoming nothing.  I think the more appropriate analogy is a sponge.  Sure, it can get saturated.  But then you squeeze it out go back to soaking up more water.  
A crypto is worth as much as the network of people who invest in it.  The question one needs to ask is how many people in the entire world are willing to put how much money into whatever crypto you’re interested in.  If you believe $300 billion, then we’ve already reached that limit.   But if you believe it can be much much higher, then this is absolutely not a bubble.  More like a tire.  It can deflate after awhile but it can be pumped back up.

Is that a rhetorical question?  
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:49:14
That’s not how it works.  45,000 daily volume means there’s demand for 45,000 BTC based on current pricing.  Only part of it is lack of supply.  So yes, if 200,000 coins hits the market, there’s suddenly a lot of supply.  Price would go down BUT the demand will also rise to meet it.  The lower the price goes, the higher the demand.  You’ll notice that with the small price dip we had yesterday, the volume went to 55,000.  With millions of people eager to get in, 200,000 would be snapped up without the price coming anywhere close to $100.  I would be buying up a hundred coins myself if it hit $1,000 even and I’m not even “wealthy”.  Would you get some panickers?  Of course.  But we’ve seen it time and again, there’s more than enough hodlers to prevent the price from sliding that far.  
All of this is also ignoring the fact that they would never be stupid enough to dump all 200,000 at one time.  It would only hurt themselves as they would get a lot less for it.  Plus, if the price goes to 25k in the next few months, they’ll only be hurting themselves.  We have to assume their finance minister isn’t a total moron.

Oops.  I replied to the main thread...
Oh I agree.  I think perhaps I could have worded it better.  What I meant was that $4.25 is where the price should be based on just technical merits.  But the fact that it’s not means there are other factors.
Just like AAPL technically should have a higher PE ratio when you compare it to tech peers.  Though you could look at it the other way around and say that AMZN, FB, NFLX, and GOOG *should* have a lower PE ratio.  All things being equal.
But of course all things aren’t equal and human psychology (branding, hype, etc) plays a big part in affecting differences in technical valuations.
There are other factors as well but even so, one could theorize that *if* there ever is a more widespread diversification beyond the Bitcoin “name brand”, Litecoin is a good case for being undervalued.  We kind of saw that effect coming into play in the last several days.

I look at it as kind of like Steve Jobs and Wozniak.  Steve Jobs is widely given sole credit, but I wonder if Apple would have even gotten off the ground without Wozniak.  
In the case of Bitcoin, it would be more like Wozniak became the recognized leader of Bitcoin.  But still, I think the analogy is still somewhat apt.  Recognizing his ingenuity, Hal Finney encouraged Satoshi and he contributed to the security of hard wallets.  Without that security, we may not be where we are today.
While it obviously isn't *his* legacy (suggesting that he alone was responsible) it's fair to say that Bitcoin is part of his legacy.  He was one of the original believers AND contributors to the project.

And yet, some endure.  It doesn't need to be the best.  It just needs to be "good enough".  For the purposes that we talk about when referring to currency, it can get there through level 2 implementations such as Lightning and Rootstock.  Ultimately, Bitcoin's greatest asset is the recognition and large ownership base.  All the other underlying tech are distant seconds to this.  Facebook and Google are evidence of this.  There were multiple times in their histories that other social networks or other search engines were as good if not better.  Yet, they still prevailed.

Like him or not, Krugman has a wide audience.  His acceptance of Bitcoin would be a big boost to the validity of Bitcoin.   
I happen to think he is actually a really good economist but that doesn’t mean he’s right about everything.  And even very intelligent people can be wrong about certain things sometimes.  Especially when they start out without a full understanding of how something new works and with flawed base assumptions.  His assumption has always been that Bitcoin has no value because he doesn’t see it.  Thus, it’s unlikely to have value for anyone else.   Therefore, the logical conclusion is that it is worth $0.  
However, it looks like he’s coming around to the fact that it does hold some value for many people and that it could have value even for him if there is continued progression of the technology that makes it easier, faster, and cheaper.  Which there is.  So, look at this as positive news.  Even the public cynics are coming around.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:45:35
If you’re afraid that any Bitcoin you spend will be worth 50% more next week, that’s no different than if you convert it back to USD as you said you planned to do.
Also, if you spend the Bitcoin, there’s no tax to pay on it since Bitcoin is still counted as an asset by the US government.  Tax is only due on any gains you have if and when you convert it back to USD.  
I agree it’s not currently viable as a currency.  But I can see how that could change in the next 4-5 years.  The speculation right now is counting on that change.  If you don’t believe that it can or will, then you shouldn’t be invested in it because if it can’t function as a currency, then it really isn’t all that useful.

That’s only because we’re in the early stages, there’s exponentially rising interest in it and just as equally there’s controversy because people don’t know what to make of it yet.  
Eventually the volatility will stabilize.  The only question is where that will be.  If you do a calculation of its market cap and compare it to the amount of money that exists in the world, a price of $1,000,000 per Bitcoin is not unrealistic.

“no one can borrow money”. This is not exactly true.  Nothing technical about Bitcoin prevents people from borrowing money.  It’s just that the overlying framework to allow this to happen hasn’t been built yet.
If you go back to the earliest days of the Internet when email on Pine and Usenet were the only “applications”, you might think that the Internet was incapable of streaming music, video, or even having secured credit card transactions.  All of that was true at the start of the Internet but it wasn’t because IP didn’t allow it.  I remember being blown away when Google Maps first came out because I had no idea that that kind of real time Internet app was possible.
The real problem with the Bitcoins naysayers is a lack of imagination for what the future could look like. You can’t compare it to anything that exists now.  That’s exactly why it’s amazing.

When something comes along that’s completely new and they don’t understand it, people always try to compare it to something familiar to them that seems similar.

And when they don’t bother researching it all, this becomes the extent to which they understand Bitcoin.

It doesn’t need to be *just* a currency.  It can also be a store of value like gold.  These aren’t mutually exclusive.  In the sense that it can already be used to buy a lot more stuff than gold in a real world situation, I’d say it’s better than gold.  And that’s not even counting its other advantages - portability, anonymity, transferability, etc.  IMO, its market valuation should be at least gold’s ($7.8 trillion) if not more.  
If and when Lightning Network is successfully implemented, I can see it eventually being a very useful form of travel currency and I would venture to guess that there will be widespread acceptance in places with high numbers of international tourists.  SE Asia would be prime.
Smart contracts would then take Bitcoin to the next level.  This is the thing that most people haven’t really wrapped their minds around.  Bitcoin is upgradeable.

None of the things that you mentioned are inherent limitations of Bitcoin.  It CAN do literally everything that cash can do (and much much more).  In the first years of credit cards, you couldn’t buy many things with them either.  Most merchants didn’t trust them and didn’t want to pay the 3% fee.
The price is only volatile because it’s the early days.  When we approach saturation (of people who would ever use Bitcoin.  Naturally there are many who won’t just like many people still don’t use credit cards), the price will stabilize.  Furthermore if the use becomes widespread enough, we may start thinking of Bitcoin as the reference price rather than USD.
These are not problems with Bitcoin itself.  They’re simply the growing pains that literally every big thing has contended with when they first started - credit cards, the Internet, cars, airplanes, etc, etc.  
To understand the potential of Bitcoin, you need to clear your mind of the way the world is and instead imagine how the world could be.

Same goes with news information.  Look at various sources.  T_D is not a source.  T_D is a shitcoin.

What I mean is BTC’s relative value.   Years ago, 1 BTC could buy you a keyboard.  Now, 1 BTC can buy you a maxed out 5K iMac.  Ergo, the value of 1 BTC increased.
I am wondering if the rising popularity of crypto currencies will lead to a dilutive effect on a BTC.  BTC’s limit is 21 million but when its number approaches that limit (in 2032 they say), an increase in its value  requires an increase in demand (increased acceptance).  However, the existence of other crypto currencies decreases that demand. Wouldn’t this hold back the growth in BTC’s value?

My concern about Bitcoin is the competing cryptocurrencies.  Do they present a headwind to Bitcoin's appreciation?  If they improve upon it, could it actually hurt BTC?  (eg Ethereum)
The broader question is can they co-exist?  Or does the existence of one threaten the others?  BTC was designed as a deflationary currency because of the upper limit of BTC that can be mined.  However, if countless numbers of other cryptocurrencies keep popping up, it's not truly deflationary anymore is it?

But in order to pay for the bits, you'd have to somehow provide ID verification along with the financial info, no?  Don't the exchanges all require this?   Are they any more reputable?  I'm new to this so all of them look the same to me.
Bitcoin is going to have issues being widely accepted if it's this difficult to find a reliable way to buy them.

This kind of makes sense doesn’t it?  A cryptocoin’s value comes from how useful it is.  There are a decent number of goods and services you can buy with BTC online (and growing).  Far fewer options with Ether and Litecoin.  And hardly any with the others.  
The current climb in price is simply a function of the increase in number of new people buying BTC relative to the rate at which it’s being mined.   New people buying a crypto will mostly buy BTC.

Yeah, comparing BTC to cocaine is going to totally legitimize it.  BTC owners like you are the risk of BTC.  
I never said it would be worthless but it’s going to put a limit on its valuation.

So then is it really a deflationary currency?

So you consider it South West?

How does this affect Bitcoin?  I’m noticing that there does seem to be a correlation between Bitcoin and the US stock market but I cannot understand why there would be.  Most BTC ownership is not by Americans.  Plus, you would think if anything, there would be a negative correlation.

I own Bitcoin but I think there is a very obvious risk that many Bitcoin owners overlook or dismiss.  If governments get the sense that it’s starting to affect their currencies, they may outlaw it.  That means no legitimate businesses could accept it.  If you can’t use Bitcoin to buy anything, it doesn’t have as much value anymore.

I love the idea of Bitcoin but this a bit silly.  It's like someone claiming they found God and it's changed their life.  It may have changed his perspective or outlook, but it didn't change anything from an objective measurable viewpoint (other than dropping 80% of its value in the last year).
When it truly becomes useful (and "changes your life") is when they have a functioning, scalable, easy to use, second layer payments system AND it becomes widespread in usage - your average local coffeeshop/grocery store/gas station accepts it.  When Bitcoin has arrived is the day that you can live your life without any fiat currency.

Say what you will about Warren Buffett, but I don't think he's ever misled people with his views on any investment.
