It's the word "explain", with the word "man" awkwardly jammed in there. 
Please tell me I don't have to elaborate on why it holds zero credibility.

Funny, there are a lot of reasons to dislike/disbelieve James Dimon, but "is a man" doesn't rate very highly for me.

Thanks. Let's never manshare from that manhole manspam site again.

When something evil happens, and some douchenozzle tries to turn it into a gender or race thing, they deserve every bit of disdain.

This thread: Why I haven't got into Bitcoin. 
What is it? Does it work? Does anyone know?

What (the actual fuck) are you going on about?

As an end user... we don't care.
Make it so we can buy coffee with bitcoin.

Got it. Unsubscribed.

Straight up. This is a flaw not a feature

Cool. A currency that can't be used be the average person. That's worked in the past. 
That aspergers is really working out for you huh.

Could / couldn't someone run Satoshi's writing style and Craigs writing style through a semantic learning algorithm to derive a signature, thus lending evidence one way or the other?

Democracy doesn't require participation or demand permanent membership.
Your argument appears to be 'the core ruleset can't be changed, therefore it's not a democracy, (?) But this would simply be analogous to a constitution.
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:49:56
If you've been around and you know how things work, you'd know how market manipulation works and you'd know how a camera works.
That's our dichotomy. Help us choose which story to believe.

welp. works for winrot. /s
@_date: 2013-07-07 23:58:16
I think you're confusing things here.
Yes that would absolutely be a democracy if:
1) It wasn't in conflict with any other social contracts (eg nationality/trade regulations etc) you were engaged in
2) Others were free to participate in that system as equals.
It's probably closer to constitutional anarchism, but it's definitely demos kratos. You're getting confused because the democracy of the USA (which is a representative democracy... and a weak one at that) doesn't like it. That doesn't have ANYTHING to do with whether or not the model of communication that underlies the bitcoin system is democratic.
Bitcoins don't remove the capacity to add additional laws - it just establishes a very clear constitutional method of exchaging information and adding to the ledger that cannot be broken.
@_date: 2013-07-08 00:31:14
The social contract conversation is perhaps a different topic for a different time. I'm just saying that this system needs to be discussed in isolation, NOT how it fits within an existing governance paradigm.
You might be closer still by calling it laissez-faire capitalism. I think the reason I would shy away from saying that is because it's no more inherently laissez-faire than coin money. We built rules upon that untracable, totally free currency, and are free to do the same here. 
Perhaps what OP is suggesting is that it's a currency that is truly demos kratos. It's controlled and owned by the people. It's also egalitarian. Anyone is a currency mint. Anyone is an exchange. Anyone is a bank. 
It's the democratisation of currency, no matter how you look at it.

Why can't I buy bitcoins anywhere without verifying my id?

Sure  work for junk mail.
@_date: 2013-07-07 11:58:05
I think that's still a form of constitutional democracy
@_date: 2013-07-07 11:59:18
Sorry OP, some people have difficulty comprehending the common structures of different communication systems.

Is this a confirmation block chain?

Proof of work systems haven't stopped spam. 
Stamps never stopped junkmail.
I don't know what other options might be out there but the solution appears to be intelligent filtering and trust networks.
