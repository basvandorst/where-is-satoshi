I encountered a fairly serious bug over a week back, where I received 25% less BTC than purchased. As a result I lost several BTC and screenshots of my account clearly show the error.
Nobody replies to support requests, even the live chat disappears once I explain the issue.
Something unusual is def occurring. Either they have 1 guy doing customer support (who is not accountable) or they have canned customer support while they focus on a bigger issue.

Be thankful BTC is up 50% since you bought. So your $ losses are prob less than you state.
Ultimately you were unlucky to invest in alts just before Segwit was activating on BTC. (or more accurately ignorant and stupid, but then lots of people randomly bought coins in the past 6 months and made money).
Suggestion: Hold the best 80%, then when BTC calms down they will shoot up. DO NOT SELL AT THESE LOW RATIOS - BTC could correct in price (while alts go up) and you will be rekt a second time if you put it all back to BTC today.
Alternative: Just hold everything and prepare to wait. Most likely in 1-2 years you'll be in profit.
Future advice: Research!! Diversifying is great but better to stick to 3-4 projects you can keep a close eye on and understand price movements etc. inside out.
All IMO (watch prices every day for 2 years. currently x10 profit but screw up all the time - mostly by playing too safe)

Exactly the same here (Europe)

Thanks for posting, good to know you're on it.

You also have to consider that these are market caps and not in any way “valuations” though.
I.e if I create a coin with a supply of 1 billion coins and sell 10,000 coins (or even 100,000 coins) for $1 each — that doesn’t mean my project is now “worth” $1b, although technically the market cap would be.
This is essentially low liquidity. 
Therefore you have to consider that most alts are worth considerably less than their market caps. The lower the daily volume (I.e further down the alt list you go) the further below their market cap the true valuation is.
So for example a “valuation” of Tron is probably in the hundreds of millions, which is less absurd.
A lot of shitcoins are already near worthless despite the market cap giving a misleading perception otherwise.

When I select to transfer to my GBP wallet it instructs me that I can transfer in GBP, hence no FX rates.

FWIW Natwest charge me £10 for the transfer, which seems reasonable.
Where I used to get stitched up is that Coinable EUR rate was always heavily in their favour. In theory a GBP wallet should remove this fx cost.

I just did the same. Glad to see a post on it.

Hello. Thanks for your reply. Yes I contacted 36 hours ago - no response. Bit disappointed it means I have to be without my BTC until you guys decide to get around to my ticket (114311)

Lol seems my replies were 2 months late :)
I read 2 months as "2 minutes" hahaha. Glad you got it sorted!

I cannot answer all the questions, however you can no longer load Mastercards as they are switching to Visa.
Weird you cannot send BTC to another BTC address though, I will try now to see if I can...

Hi there,
I've had similar issues, my account is completely ******. Nothing works and any currency exchange I make fails and the funds have just gone missing. I've sent a few emails - could ask the you look into reference 121350e3-8c0a-44e0-8b56-98e4b7d4e9b4 ASAP?

I used Wirecard a heap during 2016 and it worked really well.
However...just transferred 1 BTC to my Wirex account and then tried to load my card.
It came back with "Transaction Failed" and now the BTC has disappeared from my account.
Hopefully just a temporary glitch, but pretty alarming.
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:19:03
OK, just tested my account 100% can send BTC our from Wirex.
I suspect there's a glitch with your account where some of that 3.241 BTC is actually on your card, but the interface isn't showing this.
Maybe try sending smaller amounts of BTC to at least get out what you can?
Edit: Sure you know, but you need to click an email link (or pass 2FA if setup) before the BTC transfer will go through.
