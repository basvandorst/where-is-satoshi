This statement makes zero sense.
My point is that since bitcoin’s history is so small (not a lot of data available to analyze) it cannot be used to reliably predict how bitcoin price will behave and what patterns it follows. OP is implying that it can.
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:01:12
No they do make sense to me. Your statement is what didn’t make sense. And I think you misunderstood - I’m not saying your statement didn’t make sense to me... I’m saying it didn’t make sense. Objectively. It’s not coherent in English. Read the part I quoted again.
Nothing you have said contradicts what I have said. I don’t know why you think it does.
And yes I have taken statistics classes and done a lot of work with big data and AI, some of which was with bitcoin.

Your own definition disagrees with you, along with every definition you will find anywhere. Nowhere does it mention anything about an objective in the definition you yourself provided.

@_date: 2018-01-12 00:53:31


I never said it wasn't a currency, you made that up. I said it's not usable as one, which is true.


You are really grasping at straws here. If something can fall 10% in a day and 80% in a matter of weeks (and then take months or years to recover), as we've seen bitcoin do time and time again, it is NOT a good store of value. By your logic, ANYTHING could be a store of value so long as it can be redeemed for ANY value in the future. For something to be useful at storing value it should not fluctuate wildly on a daily basis.


Nothing that young should be considered a reliable store of valuable. There is no problem with that logic. If something better than bitcoin were to appear tomorrow I wouldn't say it's a good store of value, but if it stuck around for another 30 years or so, I may change my mind.


Actually you are wrong again, believe it or not. Just because Jewelry itself is subjective doesn't mean its VALUE is subjective. If you take a gold ring with a certain quality diamond in it to 100 different jewelers, they will all likely give you appraisals within a smaller margin than the typical price movement of bitcoin in one day. This, however, is irrelevant to the discussion.


Yeah you don't know much about computer science or cryptography do you? There will be a flaw in SHA256 the day that gravity stops working and the laws of physics and math cease to exist.


While I agree that this is among the less likely ways of bitcoin collapsing, it is not far at all from impossible. Just because it would be detectable doesn't mean it couldn't happen or that anybody would do anything to stop it. Also, you are showing here how new you are to bitcoin. I'm guessing you haven't known about it for much more than a year otherwise you'd know that this has almost happened before multiple times, once reaching 50%.


These are not comparable at all. I would argue that bitcoin's intrinsic value is actually zero. I don't think there is any use case for the ability to use the bitcoin network in particular for the purpose you described. If you disagree then please provide a use case and say why bitcoin is better than any other cryptocurrency for this purpose. Gold definitely has a significant intrinsic value that is FAR greater than that of bitcoin, if it even has any.
Literally every point you've made has been wrong or misleading. You don't have a leg to stand on.

When I say an equally damaging event could occur, I don't necessarily mean an exchange being hacked specifically - it could be governments banning bitcoin exchanges, some successful ddos attack on the network, or something neither of us has thought of. If China or the US decided to ban bitcoin and implemented that ban, the price would definitely plummet, and I think it would be on the scale of what we saw in 2014, if not greater.
Also I agree that 2014 isn't indicative of future bitcoin price behavior. Honestly I don't think any prior year of bitcoin is indicative of what it will do in the future because it's so young.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:12:29
Wait you literally don’t know what the word “objective” means lol...
Seriously go look it up. It has nothing to do with having an objective. The adjective and noun have COMPLETELY different meanings. Rofl sorry you just lost all credibility there. I don’t expect a response.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:40:06
First of all, you just completely changed your understanding of the definition of the word “objective”. I just wanted to start off by saying you’re welcome for that. I’m glad I was able to teach you something.
You are almost there. You almost get it. You are right about the definition of what objective means, but you are wrong that it doesn’t apply to semantics. There are rules in languages. If I say a sentence that is not correct in English, then it is objectively incorrect in English. The rules are well defined and there is no room for subjectivity. Your statement earlier was, objectively, nonsense. Not only was it nonsense semantically, but it was nonsense logically.
I’m glad you understand what the word objective means now. Previously you said it had to do with the noun definition which it seems you now realize is false. Just don’t try to pretend like you understood this all along because you clearly didn’t.
Lastly, my original argument is still 100% correct and you’ve said nothing to even remotely refute it.
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:53:23
This is false. When you sell, you are just selling. You’re not selling to a short seller.
1. That’s not how short selling works. Short sellers are selling, not buying. You can’t sell to a seller.
2. Institutions cannot invest in unregulated assets like bitcoin. Also they don’t want to invest in bitcoin because it’s just a bad investment.
3. Most people are selling on coinbase, and coinbase does not support short selling anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:02:16


Just because it happened recently doesn't mean it's not a major problem. You say it will be worked through - how? Also bear in mind that the number of transactions occurring on the bitcoin network even now are insignificant compared to what they would be if it became a mainstream method of payment. Visa alone processes over 1700 transactions per second, and bitcoin is doing 6 right now. Add in mastercard and amex, and bitcoin is probably at like 1/1000th of what they do. It has a LOT of distance still remaining to scale, and it will undoubtedly run into even more large problems, not the least of which will be the energy usage of the bitcoin mining network.




I don't own any gold. The ban on gold under Nixon was insignificant to the market. It was still trivial to buy, own, and sell gold during that time.


I was taking your post somewhat seriously until you wrote this. This is laughable and shows you know nothing about the real estate bubble. The real estate bubble was absolute insanity on par with the great depression of the 1930s. If you really think these things are comparable then you don't understand the nature of bubbles or the facts of what happened in 2007/8 at all.


I don't know anything about gold certificates but if they can't be redeemed for physical gold then I would agree with you here. Physical gold is better for storing value than p2p ledgers.

Until someone describes a logical way to determine a fair value for any cryptocurrency, bitcoin and all alt coin investments are 100% pure gambling.
@_date: 2018-01-12 03:02:07


You can argue semantics here all you want but the fact of the matter is that you cannot live a normal life using bitcoin for your every day purchases, nor will you likely ever be able to.


I wanted to jump back to something you said earlier that just really demonstrates your lack of understanding of this subject matter. Even you won't be able to argue with the fact that this is just 100% demonstrably false, and requires only a tiny amount of critical thinking to see why. Printing off a paper wallet and giving it to someone is not giving them bitcoin - it is giving them access to a wallet that you have access to. The person accepting the bitcoin has no way to verify that you don't still have the private key. Once you get whatever goods you gave them the bitcoin for, you could just send the bitcoin to another wallet, and now that person's paper wallet is worthless.


This shows me that you are VERY new to bitcoin, like less than a year. Let me tell you something as someone who has been involved in bitcoin for many years now - it does not always go up, and it consistently crashes HARD. Just because you bought something and it appreciated significantly over a VERY short period of time doesn't mean it is a good store of value. When people talk about stores of value, they talk about something that is resistant to economic downturns, news, and TIME. Something you can buy that will still be valuable in 30+ years. Bitcoin is a speculative asset and nobody is buying it because they think it's a safe and stable asset to hold over the coming decades. Stores of value are meant to be safe investments. If you think bitcoin is safe then you are delusional and this conversation is pointless until you learn more about finance.


I never suggested a flaw in the encryption algorithms for bitcoin. There are none. Encryption is only one aspect of the software. Suppose people find some other issues. There could be brute force attacks on the network. Someone could submit bitcoin transactions for other people's wallets with extremely low fees and invalid private keys so that the tx is in the mem pool but it doesn't get picked up and rejected, causing the bitcoin to become unavailable until the wallet owner does an rbf or doublespend or something. 99% of bitcoin owners have no clue how to do either of those things. IDK if this would work but I'm just throwing out some ideas off the top of my head. Someone who puts a lot of time into this could definitely come up with many more potential ideas, and eventually someone could come up with one that causes serious problems for bitcoin.
BTW I also have a CS degree and work in the field, dealing with this stuff every day.


We never established this. You incorrectly stated this. Just because quality is subjective does not mean it has no intrinsic value. Like I said before, find a valuable engagement ring or something and take it to 100 different jewelers, and I 100% guarantee you that the difference between their appraisals will be less than today's bitcoin volatility.


You still have not mentioned a use case outside of bitcoin itself for the BITCOIN blockchain specifically, that would give bitcoin itself intrinsic value. You are trying to change the argument here to say that bitcoin's intrinsic value is that it is useful for tracking bitcoin transactions. Obviously this makes no sense.
Seriously though, how can you read what I've written here and still disagree with me? It makes no sense at all... think about these arguments before you write them. Really consider what I've written and what you are saying. Also consider the fact that you are very new to both CS and bitcoin, and I have been involved in both for many years - in fact, decades for CS.
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:06:37
Yes, an asset can trade for billions with no intrinsic value. That's exactly what is happening with bitcoin right now. Its intrinsic value is zero and it is trading for billions. Why is its intrinsic value zero? Well it has two potential uses: 1, currency, and 2, store of value. It is 100% useless as a currency due to transaction times and fees, which means that it has zero value in this area. It will never be usable as a currency. As a store of value, it is pretty bad as far as its intrinsic properties go. Beyond the transaction fees and times, it is too volatile to be a reliable store of value. Furthermore, crypto in general is infinitely inflationary as more and more coins and forks are created, and investments start to spread out across all of the coins. Bitcoin is among the worst cryptocurrencies out there, so it's not likely to remain valuable for a long time.
There is no reason to think that bitcoin will capture 10% of gold's market cap when it serves an extremely different purpose (gambling) and has no intrinsic value. Gold, on the other hand, DOES have intrinsic value.
Like I said though, there is no way to determine its value other than to say that its value is zero for the reasons I described above.
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:05:37

Lol really? You’re linking Kant when all you need is the google definition? Or honestly any other dictionary. Even by the definition you have selected, I am still correct.
You seem to also misunderstand the definition of empirical. You are correct saying that it implies something is observably verifiable, but you are 100% wrong to say that this means it needs to have an objective. Using YOUR OWN previous example, 2 + 2 = 4 is a verifiably and objectively true statement, but it doesn’t have an objective. Likewise, it is observable and verifiable that by basic logic, your statement was nonsense. That doesn’t mean it had an objective.
All that being said, you STILL haven’t made clear what you meant by that original statement, nor have you refuted my original arguments. You just keep insulting me because you think it makes you seem smart. Clearly it’s not working lol you’re grasping at straws here bud.

Jumping to personal insults of course. That’s how you know you’re debating with a well-educated person.
Your statement implies that “sample sizes” have a purpose by saying they are “for” something. Furthermore, you then go on to describe them as being “for” a type of dataset (a noun) where it actually should be a verb or action. It would be like if I said “numbers of pixels are for cameras that don’t use film”. It doesn’t make sense. And beyond this, I still have no idea what you were trying to say, which shows how inarticulate your statement was. Not only was it incorrect semantically AND objectively (they are not mutually exclusive), but you weren’t even able to adequately convey your point.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:28:49

@_date: 2018-01-11 23:13:41
No you are completely wrong. Just because you can buy things with it doesn't make it usable as a currency. Buying a $5 beer with bitcoin is going to cost you like $15 in transaction fees, thus making it useless as a currency since you can just pay with a credit card or cash and avoid that fee.
No, you are demonstrably wrong again. If you buy bitcoin today, you absolutely cannot reliably sell tomorrow and keep its value. In fact, you may not even be able to sell at all depending on the service you use. One of the most popular ones (Coinbase) crashes whenever volatility is high, and volatility can change in a moment's notice.
Bitcoin is down 10% over the last 24 hours. If you bought yesterday, you'd have lost a LOT of money today, thus, it did NOT store your value reliably. For something to be a reliable store of value, it should have FAR more than a tiny 8 years of history that bitcoin has.
Comparing the ability to write something to the blockchain to gold's intrinsic value is a joke. I'll give you that you are right that a lot of gold's value comes from public perception and this lifts it beyond its intrinsic value that comes from its use in jewelry and electronics. That being said, gold has these properties that allow you to pretty much say with 100% certainty that it will never drop to 0 in value barring a complete apocalypse. Its intrinsic value is part of the reason for this, as well as the fact that it has been considered incredibly valuable by humans for thousands of years. Bitcoin, on the other hand, could easily fall to zero for many, many possible reasons. Governments could ban it easily, another alt coin could eclipse it, a loophole could be found in its protocol, somebody could control 51% of the network, etc.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:19:55
“We’re” or “where”? Rofl
Something being “objectively” true is the opposite of it being “subjectively” true, meaning basically it is fact and not opinion. For something to be objective, it just means it’s not based on opinion but rather based on something deterministic (facts).
This has nothing to do with and object or goal. I don’t know where you got that idea but it is wrong. Your own definition doesn’t even say or imply this.
Your original statement was objectively nonsense because it is not an opinion that it doesn’t make sense, but rather a fact. It’s not like I personally don’t understand it - it’s that you wrote it in a way that doesn’t make sense to anyone other than yourself.
Keep the insults and name calling coming bud!

Yea Bitcoin has been around for a whole 8 years. Wow! What a long time! It must keep doing what it’s done before since it has such a long history of success.
Sarcasm aside, come back when bitcoin has survived for over 4,000 years like gold. Bitcoin’s history of success is tiny and is not a reliable indicator of what it will do in the future. This drop in price is 100% justified. Maybe an alt coin will rise to these levels again one day but bitcoin is intrinsically worth nothing due to its scaling issues, among others.
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:39:49
This is just flat out false. Look how much money people make in the stock market. Stocks can be valued through processes that involve analyzing financial reports and industries, but bitcoin has nothing to differentiate between whether $5 per coin is fair or $5 billion per coin, or $15,000. All of these options are equally illogical. This does not hold true for stocks.

It’s so insane to make this argument. You are essentially leaning on bitcoin’s history as support for what it will do in the future, yet it’s history is so tiny and insignificant. It’s 8 years old, and going up because people think it’s a store of value. Your argument might make sense if it had been around for four thousand years like gold, but bitcoin has no significant history to indicate what it will do in the future.

What do you mean you don't understand why bitcoin as an investment is relevant? Bitcoin as an investment is exactly what we are discussing. This thread is saying you should hold because your bitcoin will be worth more in the future, which makes it an investment.
If you don't see bitcoin as an investment, what do you see it as? Obviously it's not usable as a currency or even remotely useful for transferring value because:
1. It's incredibly volatile and can significantly change value even while a transaction is processing
2. Transactions take enormous amounts of time, and the platform isn't even 1% of 1% of the size it would need for global adoption. Consider that Visa alone processes over 1700 transactions per second.
3. Transaction fees are insanely high, to the point that it's virtually impossible to send anyone any amount of money under like $30, and even at that price point you are paying fees in excess of 50%.
Bitcoin is useless as a currency, and useless as a store of value, so what do you see it as? Maybe there is a place in the world for an alt coin (probably something like IOTA) but bitcoin is an insane bubble right now and it will never achieve anything remotely close to global adoption IMO.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:11:35
It's a long time when you are talking about technology... but we aren't discussing it's maturity as a technology, we are discussing its behavior as an investment. In terms of investment history for something that derives 100% of its price from being a store of value, 8 years is the blink of an eye. It is not a currency, nor can it ever be due to the transaction times and costs, in addition to many other reasons.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:16:45
1. I never said it has to exist 4,000 years, but 8 years is a very short time... even on the scale of the past 100 years.
2. Bitcoin is rising because people are seeing it as a store of value. One of the most important factors in determining if something is a good store of value is how long it has been around. With gold, for example, we can say with near 100% certainty that it will not lose all of its value in the next 10 years, or even 100 years. With Bitcoin, we cannot make that claim even on the scale of 1 year. Part of the reason we can say these things with confidence is because gold has been around so long and bitcoin has not.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:20:45

Hey guys,
This is a project I've been working on for several months and I just put it up online. I wrote software that analyzes patterns in the rise and fall of bitcoin prices over the past few years, and tries to predict future prices based on these patterns. It's surprisingly accurate actually, with an average error of about 1.35% for prices within 24 hours and 2.62% for prices within 5 days.
This website displays the predictions and is updated every hour on the hour. You can learn a lot more about the project on the website's "about" page.
Anyway let me know what you guys think! I would greatly appreciate any comments or feedback!
@_date: 2014-03-13 03:20:13
Also another point to note is that the 5 day chart shows predictions of the average price over 6 hour periods, and the 24 hour one is average prices over 1 hour periods. This can account for some differences sometimes, though probably not in this instance. Usually this would explain situations where the short term is changing more than the long term.
@_date: 2014-03-24 12:00:55
To the people who think there is no neural network and that I am trying to manipulate the market:
I've spent a huge amount of time learning about neural networks and programming this one to be as accurate as it is. To think that I am arbitrarily making up 84 different prices every hour 24/7 and updating this website is ridiculous.
For those of you who are skeptical of the accuracy:
This is reasonable. It is not 100% accurate and news stories definitely will cause changes in price that the software will not predict. However, it does seem to perform pretty well generally - especially the 24 hour chart. The 20 day chart is definitely unreliable though. I think you would have trouble finding a better means of predicting bitcoin prices than this software, and I certainly don't think you would come close to this accuracy with a human guessing.

@_date: 2014-03-13 03:25:04
The prices contradict each other in the long and short term charts a bit, but not enough to make one 100% correct and the other 25% correct. That would be the case, for example, in a situation where the short term chart predicted $1000 and the long term chart predicted $250, which is far from the case here.
I explained in a few posts how the average error is calculated, and it is explained on the about page of the website. The error is basically how far off the predicted prices are from the actual prices.

Yeah that is one funny "issue" I noticed. I don't really have a good explanation for that, although I would trust the 24 hour predictions more, since they have a lower average error.
The error is calculated by trying to predict the price on historical data and then seeing how far off it was. It does this at a few tens of thousands of points throughout the data's history and averages the errors.
@_date: 2014-03-13 03:11:06
I think calling this a license to print money is a bit of an exaggeration =P
If you don't believe me on the figures of accuracy, I can explain to you how I got them. I don't really see what I would stand to gain by lying about them. I get those figures by having the program attempt to predict the price of bitcoins at tens of thousands of points throughout history, and comparing its estimates to the actual data. The average errors of those tests are where I got these figures.
And when I say I don't have the time or money, I mean because I am in college, in debt, and have been spending a large portion of my time working on this project.
I really hope you believe me, I am not trying to scam anyone here. I don't even see how I possibly could.
@_date: 2014-04-04 00:46:06
I don't explain it because almost everyone either doesn't care or won't understand. But if you want, here is a brief explanation. I have to go in like 5 minutes but if you really want you can email me and I'll explain it in more detail. btcpredictions
The neural network looks at only % changes in price, not actual prices. I came up with the idea to do this after implementing a NN that looked at actual prices and didn't work very well. Looking at % changes works WAAYYY better. For the 24 hour prediction it takes 60 inputs and outputs 24 future prices. It trains on the historic price data, containing something like 4 million transactions that have occurred over the past 3 years. I know that it can generalize because in order to attain the error that it does on a data set this large, it HAS to generalize. A 3 layer neural network can only represent a continuous function, and nothing more complex than that. No continuous function could possibly become specified to training data this large and complex to the point of being incapable of generalizing. This is how I can say that it's accuracy on the training set is indicative of its accuracy on future prices.

Believe it or not this is the first time I've ever used reddit. And this software doesn't steal anything from anyone, all it does is make predictions.
@_date: 2014-03-13 03:00:00
If I did this correctly, the time zones displayed on the graphs should be whatever time zone you are in. I just have javascript ask for the current month, day, and hour, so whatever time zone your computer clock is set to should be what the site displays.
@_date: 2014-03-24 22:41:36
I'm not sure what you're showing in that picture. But also to be completely honest, I kinda messed up the first few days I had this software running... I accidentally had it making its predictions against the wrong file lol. It's reading the right data and working properly now though.
@_date: 2014-04-03 23:47:51
It is far from hocus pocus. I don't think you're understanding what I'm saying about patterns, or maybe I'm explaining it poorly - there ARE patterns. That is objectively true. You do not need to know what causes the patterns to occur, as long as you understand the actual pattern. I'll repeat, it does not matter the SLIGHTEST bit what factors are affecting the price, as long as they are affecting it in a pattern (which we know that they are).
What the neural network does is it learns this pattern. Then, when it sees a piece of that pattern, it knows what the next part is. That is how it predicts future prices. It does not depend on any kind of mechanism in the market itself, nor does it depend on the irrational behavior of market participants. It only depends on the outcome of these things, which is a predictable pattern.
Just because a human doesn't understand something doesn't make it hocus pocus. Neural networks are known to be able to perform recognition tasks that people even have trouble with sometimes. I once wrote a neural network that could recognize hand-written digits. It was able to recognize some digits that were written so poorly that even I, a human with eyes and a brain, could not definitively classify.
Also, just to reiterate, if any of what I was saying were false then this neural network wouldn't be able to predict prices for the next 24 hours with under 1.3% error.
@_date: 2014-04-03 23:13:29
I will give you that it is incapable of seeing how relevant real-life events in the news will affect bitcoin prices, but when there aren't big real-life events occurring what else would determine bitcoin prices? Regardless of what it is, there is guaranteed to be some pattern to it. Nothing in the universe is random - especially not something like this. Just because you or I can't see patterns doesn't mean they aren't there. There is no way that the neural network could learn to predict the price 24 hours out with an average error of under 1.3% for 3 years of data if there weren't some pattern. It may be (and probably is) a wildly complicated pattern, but it's a pattern.
@_date: 2014-03-24 22:32:08
Yes, since the beginning of bitstamp, which is about 3 years
@_date: 2014-03-24 12:42:16
Well first of all, the amount of people who I would need to follow me if I were to try to manipulate the market would pretty much be insurmountable. Second of all, there is no way I could arbitrarily make up that many numbers and update this website every hour 24/7.
I PROMISE you there is software behind this. I use a 3 layer forward feed neural network with backpropogation of error, sigmoid function as activation function, and % change in price as input and output. I calculate the % error by having it make predictions at some tens of thousands of points throughout the historic bitstamp data and calculating how far off the predictions are from the actual price (on average).
I don't know what else I can say to prove to you that I'm not arbitrarily making up numbers.
@_date: 2014-03-28 00:15:41
I'm sorry that you're having so much trouble understanding this
@_date: 2014-03-13 04:15:12
Yeah I might do that, I had thought about that before (showing the average margin of error on the graph). 2.62% isn't exactly free money, but I like to think it's more than "almost useless" for trading. It tends to be pretty accurate at determining trends even if it's off on the prices sometimes.
@_date: 2014-03-24 13:33:42
You are right and you'll notice that I am not sharing the source code - that is still proprietary.
@_date: 2014-03-13 03:13:33
That's what I'm planning to do at some point, possibly as my next step with this project. I didn't have the time because I was still working on what I have just produced so far. This has literally been online and updating for 2 hours and 15 minutes so far
@_date: 2014-04-04 00:31:39
Except I explained to you in our conversation why what you are saying is false and that these errors actually ARE indicative of the error of future predictions, and you've yet to respond to my last point :P
Also I can assure you that this type of network is far from trivial. It took a very long time and a huge amount of work to get it as accurate as it is, and the fact that you don't see every trader using it proves this.
And yes I am interested. What is my implementation in your words? lol
@_date: 2014-03-24 12:07:57
If you really think there is no software behind this and that I'm arbitrarily making up numbers to try to manipulate the market then you are way too paranoid and need to try to think about why your theory actually makes no sense...
@_date: 2014-03-24 13:01:22
I don't think you're right about the number of people who would be needed to manipulate the market but whatever, that's irrelevant.
I've never claimed to be a "pro trader". I've also said repeatedly that the prices here are not guaranteed and they are sometimes wrong. I shared this because it's a project that I'm proud of and to keep it all to myself would be boring. People have been finding my project interesting and maybe even useful. I have no reason to keep this a secret - there is no benefit to doing that. If you want to see how accurate this model is, just track its predictions against actual prices. Like I've said, it's far from perfect, but it does perform reasonably well.
I can understand your suspicion if people try to manipulate the market often. I can assure you that I am not trying to do that though. If I were, I wouldn't have predicted for the prices to stay so flat for the next 5 days :P
@_date: 2014-04-04 00:34:58
This is extremely far from what I am doing lol... I did not base my implementation off of anything. I made it up after experimenting with a ton of different options. You're presuming a lot about my project and its accuracy and I don't know why.
@_date: 2014-04-03 22:57:07
It's interesting that you compare an artificial neural network to a human neural network - the original inspiration for this computational model!
It is true that a human's brain is more complicated than the artificial neural network used to make these predictions. However, they are really difficult to compare. A human brain is more complicated than a calculator, but a calculator is WAY better at math than any human.
I could talk all day about the comparison between human brains and computers, but I'll try to be brief. Computers can store WAY more data, and computers are WAY faster (like literally millions of times faster). However, brains reign supreme when it comes to parallel processing. But anyway, the point is that a computer is more capable of analyzing large amounts of data and finding patterns that there is no way any living human could possibly see. Humans don't need to see these kinds of patterns in order to survive/reproduce, so there is no reason we would evolve a brain that is wired to see them. We wire our brains efficiently, pruning out what we don't need and keeping what is necessary.
I seriously doubt any human can consistently predict more accurately than this software over a long enough period of time. Neural networks are pretty amazing in their ability to find patterns and understand data that humans cannot.
P.S. This is my website and I wrote the neural network that makes these predictions :)
P.P.S. Thank you for sharing it, OP!
@_date: 2014-04-04 00:38:36
It's the error rate of predictions on ALL PRICES THAT HAVE EVER HAPPENED. Obviously I can't tell the future, otherwise the average error would be zero! And this IS indicative of future prices, and I've explained why in our other conversation.
@_date: 2014-03-24 15:18:34
Thanks, I really appreciate it!
@_date: 2014-03-13 04:26:53
I mean, yeah it will change sometimes. It's not always accurate. However, to be fair that's like less than a 2% change. Sometimes it will get the price wrong, but it certainly performs better than a human. Either way, it's usually pretty good at showing the general trends. I think you would be hard pressed to find any means to predict more accurately than this. I spent a lot of time getting this to be as accurate as it is.
@_date: 2014-03-24 12:47:18
I want to keep the source code proprietary at the moment, but I can tell you a bit about how it works:
I use a 3-layer forward feed ANN with backpropogation of error. Sigmoid function is the activation function. The inputs and outputs are % change in price rather than price itself (I found that doing it this way was a HUGE improvement over using the actual prices). The 24 hour prediction ANN uses 60 inputs, 24 outputs, and 200 hidden nodes. The 5 day ANN uses 80 inputs, 20 outputs, and 200 hidden nodes. The 20 day prediction uses 300 inputs, 40 outputs, and 350 hidden nodes.
If you have any more questions I'm happy to answer them!

@_date: 2017-11-27 17:56:43
It’s intrinsic value is absolutely not insignificant. People would not by gold jewelry if it were too expensive, and this would absolutely push prices down. The impact of its use in electronics may be smaller but it is not completely insignificant. It’s used in other applications as well.
Bitcoin may be more scarce, but crypto is significantly less scarce as a whole. In fact, crypto is infinite. Precious metals have a finite quantity on earth, but more and more crypto currencies can be created indefinitely.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:09:59
Lol you’re hopeless 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:35:30
All coins will likely move together, the same way stocks in the same sector tend to move together. For example, if Verizon goes up then so does at&amp;t, tmobile, sprint, etc. some may move more or less than others though, but likely in the same direction. It’s highly unlikely that bitcoin moves one direction and other crypto moves in a different direction.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:45:28
But gold has more intrinsic value. It is used to make jewelry and it has many applications in electronics and chemistry as well. Bitcoin is like gold but it is not yet as good a store of value, and it doesn’t have any other properties that give it value like gold does.
Also I don’t see why bitcoin warrants such a high price compared to other crypto, other than being first to market.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:24:18
I was responding to a post claiming that bitcoin is no more overvalued than Amazon or Microsoft... did you read the thread?
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:28:51
I don’t think it will panicsell to another currency either. I do think it will panic sell though, and that the whole crypto market will crash. I think when it recovers, bitcoin will not be the leader. Look at MySpace for an example of someone who was first to market and not the winner.  It gives bitcoin a head start, but others can catch up and surpass it very well quickly. Look how fast bitcoin went from being scarcely known to being talked about every day on the mainstream news.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:34:04
Yeah I would wait... futures plus institutions could cause insanity. It will give a lot of people a lot of power to short bitcoin and pressure it downward, which it is long overdue for it we are being realistic.

If you plan on investing in bitcoin then the only viable way to do this is hold long term. Buying now would not be a good idea, you will definitely have much cheaper entry point opportunities, possibly as low as $2,000 or lower. Also, I would choose a different crypto currency than bitcoin. Being first to market has made it the biggest and most popular, but not the best. If crypto does become widely adopted across the globe, I don’t think bitcoin will be the winner.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:16:16
No, you absolutely won’t. They are not up 1900% in 12 months, and they have income statements and balance sheets to support their valuations.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:11:44
Why do you think it would be so much lower? Based on what? Clearly consumers are more than happy to pay current prices for gold. Why would any jewelers sell it for any less than that?
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:40:41
If you are talking about a model for trading that would make sense, but we are talking about a method for determining value, the same way an analyst explains exactly how they come up with a price target for a stock. Maybe you didn’t understand that. I’d go back and read more carefully if I were you.
Btw congrats on your performance reviews! You must feel really good when your boss praises you!

You have not explained how you calculated its fundamental value to be over $10,000. What intrinsic properties of bitcoin warrant that price, and how do you know they warrant that price? Please explain the math you used to come to this conclusion.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:25:08
The fact that people store it does not mean it’s value isn’t defined in its industrial uses. Look at diamonds - there’s tons of them sitting in safes to keep the market from flooding. Look at opec, cutting oil production is essentially doing the same thing as storing gold or diamonds to reduce supply.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:13:34
But why do you think bitcoin will be one? Because it is first to market? Momentum will only take it so far. I can see crypto playing a major role in the future, but it is not there yet, and there is no guarantee that bitcoin itself will be part of that.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:23:02
Do you know anything about efficient market theory? I would recommend reading about it. While what you are saying is possible, it seems unlikely.
Basically the idea is that market prices tend to reflect all available information about the underlying assets, meaning that something can’t be under or overvalued for very long. In a perfectly efficient market, those concepts don’t even exist. Real markets are not 100% efficient, but they are pretty efficient... efficient enough that an asset doesn’t remain massively undervalued for 8+ years.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:26:58
But why do you think the “real value” is over $10k? What is the value and how did you calculate it? Why is bitcoin worth that much but ether, Ltc, and other crypto are worth so much less?
IMO the market is efficient enough that bitcoin would not remain undervalued for 8+ years. That seems like a stretch.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:59:54
Lol you are so dumb dude. “I can promise you that bitcoin is worth a million dollars per coin. I can’t tell you why because my valuation methods are secret but they are really good, I swear!!!” How do you not see how idiotic your argument is?

There are places where bitcoin can be shorted but not on the scale that will be offered by CME group that will attract hedge funds and other institutions. Whether institutional investors will be going long or short is another question, and I think there will be a lot of short pressure.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:42:20
If you have a method of valuing bitcoin that suggests it is undervalued and you hold bitcoin, why on earth would you not share that? You would only stand to benefit. I doubt your method is any better than the ones that you claim suck.
Don’t expect anyone to take you seriously or give you any credit when you make ridiculous claims if you provide NOTHING to back those claims. Asking you for your reasoning behind your fanatical claims is not being demanding. What you are doing is like claiming that you can bench press 2,000 pounds but only when nobody is looking, and then calling me demanding when I ask you to prove it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:14:32
Why don’t you think this will just be a mechanism for institutions to short bitcoin? It seems like most institutions are agreeing that bitcoin is flying too high too fast. Some $100+ billion fund could just decide to throw some pocket change into shorting bitcoin and send the price plunging. Most people in bitcoin now will jump ship easily because they have never seen it in a bear market and weren’t around in 2013/2014. A selling snowball effect could be triggered effortlessly by these giant institutions.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:15:32
I am not mad about bitcoin at all, I was mad that you made such a stupid comment. It’s like asking someone to prove that there is NOT an invisible Flying Spaghetti Monster that controls everyone’s mind.

They absolutely should be hated on, they are a garbage service that takes advantage of people for their own profit. Their fees are insanely high yet they consistently crash during periods of volatility. They are making a TON of money and they can’t afford to scale up their system to handle traffic? They could charge 1/4 the fees they charge today and scale their system up, and still have money left over.
They were doing a live demo of coinbase on CNBC yesterday and they tried selling some bitcoin, and it failed with an unknown error. They then tried to buy immediately after, and that worked fine. That is just ridiculous... what kind of so-called software engineers are working on this? There should be virtually no errors ever with financial software...
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:19:10
No, the burden of proof is on you to prove that it IS warranted. Why do you believe that bitcoin’s fundamental value is 1900% higher today than it was 12 months ago? What has changed about bitcoin inherently? Or do you just believe it was undervalued the whole time and the market is just insanely inefficient?

@_date: 2017-11-27 18:05:14
Absolutely, 100%. Gold could NEVER be $10,000 per ounce today because tons of suppliers would be willing to sell it for far less than that. It’s driven by supply and demand, and the demand comes largely from its use in jewelry. It also comes from its long history of being a safe store of value.
For the record, it doesn’t make sense to give so much value to the ceo or one bank if you are going to ignore the ceos of others. Remember when Jamie Dimon called bitcoin a fraud? And remember when Nobel prize winning Robert shiller called it a bubble?

The potential downside is literally the roof over his head. The most you can lose gambling is however much you spend. They are no different in that regard... and they both have unlimited upside potential.
Actually yeah, the downside and upside potential are exactly the same in these two scenarios. You take out a loan. You could lose it all gambling or lose it all in Bitcoin. And in both you have unlimited upside potential.
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:54:39
As has been stated here already, the guy who took out the home equity loan is an idiot. It was a bad decision. It's not even a debatable topic. There is no wiggle room here for an opinion. If you don't think he's an idiot then you are objectively wrong. Taking a home equity loan to invest in Bitcoin is insanely reckless and the risk vs reward makes it not even close to worth it. Even if you feel it is worth risking your HOME in order to get some money, Bitcoin is not even close to the best investment to do that with. You would have better chances doing something like trading options.
Taking out a home loan to invest in Bitcoin is essentially like taking out a home loan to play slots or roulette - it's an objectively bad decision.
@_date: 2017-09-02 13:53:38
Gambling has unlimited upside potential because you can just keep playing.
The one thing you've said that is correct is that in gambling, you know the odds are statistically against you. The point I am making is that both are based on chance - profiting in Bitcoin vs gambling. Both have the same upside and downside potential.
