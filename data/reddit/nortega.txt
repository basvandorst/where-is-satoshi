As much as I like free money...

From and investment/speculator perspective, it could be viewed as very exciting. Here are some quasi-famous business men that have claimed to be sitting on a fortune in this gold 2.0. Or it could be a forced lecture where you listen to them tell you how much more valuable they are now. Peasant.  
Best keynote speakers? Maybe. They do represent large players in how we digitally interact with the world. I'm trying to think who else would bring this much press?

This sort of information is key right now, for people like myself that are trying to figure out a brand new business model in real time. Look at it from a biz owners point of view, we need information on how to structure a system to accept and **value** a brand new currency. It makes sense to talk to people on this sub to crowdsource ideas quickly because if your going to adopt this new model, you can't wait around for it to become common place... we have to construct the system. I think it is interesting reading about how the different types of businesses are adopting to a *currency in search of goods and services*. I don't look at it as if a jewelry company that posts is trying to pedal me 2 chains, but how they are solving a bigger problem and how some of their solutions might allow me to sell you on making a new animated series, commercial... or maybe you wanna make a comic book? Come on man, just buy one cartoon from me! 
Just kidding, but remember, the more commercial viability the BTC has... the better.

Depends on how you watched the movie I guess. I can imagine them as men with ideas and foresight, that maybe trust too much and put their faith in the wrong... waitaminute... fuck-

So do you see yourself ~~daytrading~~ *minute trading* (this market moves too fast for the old terminology)? With more volume in your control it would seem you could create small ripple effects now as opposed to later as the overall market is starting to stabilize (or so it seems).

Wow, both feet as they say. Congrats! I found [this post on volume]( to be particularly enlightening on the stats. I would think that having more market power to ride the extreme waves that are occurring now would be great. Unfortunately I do not have the expendable investment money to be as deep as you just got. But it would be exciting!

It would be real nice to be able to scroll back historically in 24hr view (or other 'zoomed in' views). Few if any charts allow this. Could be one other thing to help set you apart. Great work!
