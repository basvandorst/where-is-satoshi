More realistic ones :
1. Bitcoin gets persistent bad image for whatever reason, it becomes uncool to be associated with bitcoin, majority of people moves away
2.another, yet-unknown technology overtakes and phases out bitcoin
3. Governments press for more kyc and aml, exchanges comply. Then customer protections and reporting regulations follow, exchanges comply via mechanisms that do not involve blockchain. Eventually some sort of mass embrace-extend-extinguish scenario happens, where "bitcoin on exchange" loses all resemblance to "bitcoin blockchain", yet majority of users keep using exchanges because they are convenient (now with government protection! If you make a mistake, you can charge back and recover your money! With PayPal buyers protection if you link your email), and hardly anyone cares about "not your keys, not your coins" anymore

Cloning is difficult : they need to know piece of info called Ki that only a handful of people inside operator company know and have access to and once you get a clone you need to convince the victim to turn the phone off or else your clone will not register on the network.
 Much easier is to a)request replacement sim (but old sim will stop working and it might not be easy); B) request number porting when it is available (but he number will stop working and there would be multiple confirmations; c)just try to log in and then call the victim in the attempt to phish the code out of him or get him to change the password. I think they tried to do (c)
