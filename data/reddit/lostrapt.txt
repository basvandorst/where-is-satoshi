It’s just a message associated with the transaction, I’m not exactly sure you understand what those messages are, what exactly do you mean by “clear my shit”?

Also, you should not use that website, lots of misinformation in there, that website is a bait and switch trap that wants you to buy bcash instead of bitcoin (at least always have that in mind when reading there)

Reddit is a good Source, beta.cent.co has cool stuff also, you can use that one too just keep in mind the agenda they are trying to push (they are bad for the ecosystem)

Blocks don’t interact with each other, when you send a message in a transaction you are basically broadcasting it to the world, for example, on the miners case they were broadcasting their stance in the vote.

she used an analogy as in bitcoin addresses are as "anonymous" as IP addresses

1 confirmation should be enough, but some exchanges requires about 10 confirmations so I’m not sure. But 10 confirmations could take a while, Id say 1 is enough, maybe do 2 to be sure
