These last two months have had the most crypto related bullish news in history IMHO. The list goes on and on. It's stunning that BTC is not rallying here. I'ts one of two things 1) Large investors saw the green light and want to get it cheap. I don't see them driving price below $5000. I see them just accumulating. So they will do this until Oct-Nov when the ICE contract goes live and Nasdaq launches it's own type of channel. This would make BTC go sideways for a few months. Or 2) Futures has killed the market. The only thing that helped gold go up was the ETF launch. If it wasn't for that, it would have stayed in the gutter. Futures was designed to decrease volatility and create more stable pricing for commodities. So there is a chance that the large investors will channel their money into other projects such as Tokenized securities and Exchanges. This way they make all the money on fees and let the newbs get REKT. -But the fact that asia didn't jump in today is not a good sign. Just a thought guys...i could be totally wrong

I forgot to mention Toshi...when you click on the Trezor website link, make sure to scroll down and read the FAQ section...it will answer a lot of questions about how they separate themselves from other competitors like LastPass and Roboform....cheers

Absolutely Tosh....it is by far one of the best solutions out there right now....here are a couple of links that might help you
One is Trezor's site which explains in detail
The other is a basic walkthrough of how to use the device...keep in mind...back up your data to both Dropbox and Google Drive. This way if there is a data issue with either company and all info is lost, then you have a back up of everything....all usernames and passwords are encrypted on Dropbox and Drive, so don't worry if they are breached...they need the Trezor device to de-crypt the info
Hope this helps

So sorry to hear that brother.....i use Trezor wallet and it has a password manager feature as well which IMHO is the best in the industry...you can also use it as a U2F security key, so you need it plugged into your mac or pc in order to access your wallet or passwords...it also doesn't allow hacking even if your device has a virus or malware....I also use a dedicated pc laptop that i use only for wallets and crypto related work-offline...thanks for sharing your story...this will help others be safer...i think this is why an ETF or physically settled custody solution is needed for people with sub par technology skills
