I tried one of the free numbers out and it worked for registering with the site i wanted to.  I had to use a UK number.  Im thinking of using the pay service.  WOuld you say the the free numbers give an idea of what countries work for signing up to certain services?

or buy citizenship elsewhere.  St kitts and Nevis  for example.  it costs 250k, but if your taxes are above that, its worth doing.  especially because you now have another passport that is almost as good as an EU passport

whatever, you must love the government and its thugs.

Well it depends if you bought on an exchange.  If you didnt, then you just sell for cash (in person) and then just live a cash existence.  
If you did buy on an exchange, you could still do this, but maybe eventually it could catch up to you, but you could say you lost keys, or whatever.  Yo, fuck the IRS and their war taxes.  the federal govt spends 50% of taxes somehow directly or indirectly on WAR.

yes ive been around since 2013.  A sell out is someone who was once down, and now buys in, or sells out.  Facebook and zuckerberg are one of the driving forces behind big brother everything.  FB is a privacy nightmare and as a technology, it's prolly brought more harm to humanity than atomic weapons or biotech

If you are going to use a mixer.  There is no point in using shared send as the mixer will eliminate all taint.  
So send coins to mixer, then use mixers wallet to send to your desired place to spend them without any taint from where you bought them.  
@_date: 2014-05-18 04:52:06
  is better b/c they don't list "coins" like ripple &lt;-centralized

I am interested in nubits, Is there a way to hold them securely like I can keep bitcoin in paper wallets or offline cold storage?

I have a question about the coinmixing strategies in darkwallet.  I have read the wiki : 
But I am still wondering what taint would be left if I used the various mixing strategies and the stealth address.
@_date: 2014-09-27 20:02:44
Lets say I only use the "send from" option.  and only send available funds from that address? Like I send all at once from that address  so there is no change addresses created 
@_date: 2014-04-23 04:07:15
It's not about laundering money.  There are many reasons other than darknet transactions.  Like using bitcoins and not wanting my balance known on the address I use it from.  Simple privacy reasons.

Try not to go long at when it tops out.  wait for a dip.  It tested 237-240 a few times and always got rejected.  
Also maybe set tighter stop losses
@_date: 2015-01-07 19:36:09
so technically if you are holding then you are long (bullish) because otherwise you would sell.  Right?

A few questions:
Does chainalysis look at the other forked BTC blockchains to gather intelligence on split coins?
How good is  for looking at one's coins to see if they have had taint?  There was a period when I was buying from an LBC trader and recently when I looked at some of my coins that came from him I saw one set that had taint to a DNM.  I'm wondering what I should do if I ever want to sell these on an exchange and don't want them to get flagged.  I guess use coinjoins and wasabi?
edit:  Also Does the company have agreements with exchanges to get the exchanges internal ledger of transactions.  For instance, If I used a gambing site and withdrew BTC from them, then deposited to an international exchange that only requires email and PW (say Binance) for trading and then withdrew  LTC and deposited it to Gemini .  If you had contracts with these entities, would CA then be able to say to gemini "yea that customers LTC was tied to a gambling site"

Nopoint,  I have entered semi-retirement where I work a job that I love to do and I volunteer my time a lot.  
You can better yourself, the world and all that by donating your time to someone or somewhere that needs it.
Every now and then I will set up BTC wallet install nights with people who have asked my about it.  
Doing things to help the network are great

If i only use the address once and spend the entire amount recieved (so no change addresses) is there any way to link it with any of my other addresses from my HD wallet?

Hopefully it was to a segwit wallet.  It's not a bc1 address but it could still be segwit

[wasabi wallet](
for amounts below .1  try join market or [moneromixer](
@_date: 2019-09-01 03:20:09
try   its free.  it will show you if coins came from a known place
@_date: 2019-09-09 23:09:42
[moneromixer]( mixes a bunch of cryptos.  It does have a trusted part which is sending and receiving from non-kyc exchanges.  
I would prolly just use wasabi
The days of Bitcoinfog and bitblender style mixers should be over.
@_date: 2019-09-08 22:07:35
Does anyone know of a template to print these your self?  I would print them, and then on the other-side have instructions on how to get a proper wallet and how to sweep these.  I would rather print these myself then have someone else do it and know the private key

Unless he transferred it to an exchange and bought  BTC.  That would be a nice fomo candle

@_date: 2018-12-26 20:21:41
To bad it's not a segwit wallet (starts with 1, instead of 3 or bc1)
@_date: 2016-07-14 20:38:01
Is the site down
@_date: 2018-12-29 19:45:10
Why?  Because he isn't even using a SEGWIT wallet.  He deserves all the hate he is getting for clogging up the network with his legacy transactions
@_date: 2019-05-19 23:16:44
Dont cash out through a KYC exchange.  In fact do a cash trade and then just spend that cash.  The US spends way to much money on wars abroad and oppression at home.
Local bitcoins still can be a place to find traders who do cash trades.  Just dont kyc through LBC, there are traders that leave their phone numbers on their offers.  Sure you might have to pay 5% below spot, but thats better than paying 15 or 30% taxes to the empire
@_date: 2019-05-21 00:36:01
maybe not a dollor,  but 1k instead of 8k.

only if you are buying from a dealer.  If you buy from a person there is always ways to arrange the selling price btwn the two of you
@_date: 2019-05-19 23:19:32
Thats why its best to keep it out of the back.  Cash out 8k in a cash trade via some non KYC trader on local bitcoins.  Spend it on all your daily expenses: food entertainment, this of that nature.  Then when cash is dwindling, hit that same trader.  
There is also local monero, and local bitcoin cash.  Just convert your BTC into those
