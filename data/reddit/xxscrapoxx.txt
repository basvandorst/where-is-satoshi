Due to the myriad responses, I’m clearly seeing the flaws in my logic. And seeing how people lose panic selling as well. If we were clairvoyant it would all be so much easier lol. Now I’m wondering how long I should keep holding the bag on iota. I’ll give em some more time though. I don’t have enough invested to make day trading profitable yet. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:42:13
I bought eth at like 400. Not to jynx it, but it’s still doing way better than that. Besides, I knew I was going to the roulette table when I started.  
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:12:22
But still they’re making enough money to hire on and expand. People shouldn’t be losing 10s of thousands via transfers. 
Personally when I went into crypto it was woh the expectation to lose everything, but I’d hate to lose it that way. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:44:23
Also it’s opened the market to investors with hundreds of dollars vs tens of thousands. So, you have a lot of amateur investors. (Myself included) 
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:32:41
Good point. But then that’s how people get screwed too I guess. Wish I was clairvoyant lol.

I just sodl 100k btc and bought Intel gpus?!!!
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:35:54
I bought eth at like 500 a few weeks ago. If 900-1000 is tanking then I’m a happy man. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:22:18
I’m new to trading and I don’t get this. People really do that? Like, how could you sell at a loss? Unless you really think the stock or coin is never gonna comeback. And even then, it’s gambling at the end of the day, win some lose some. Selling at a loss is a guaranteed lose. I’d rather hold out on the hopes of a miracle. Also, I wouldnt invest something I wasn’t willing to gamble. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 05:26:08
Nice snark. Helpful. Thanks. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:05:46
So, where can I use that’s better? I was under the impression coinbase was the best one? 
@_date: 2019-07-06 16:43:57
Eth was down to 75$ at one point. It’ll be back over 1k Eventually, I’m thinking of getting more now at 350 or whatever it’s at.. but learned too many hard lessons last year, scared to spend money still.
@_date: 2019-07-06 16:47:17
Hello me! I bought a few months earlier though, I’m almost broke even right now.

Nope. Just a statement. Very observant of you!

Having the value of each of your coins move 9$ is different than having it move 14,000$ 
It’s not that hard a concept. If you think 20k is ever coming back you’re delusional.

@_date: 2018-08-14 18:17:07
I’m aware, but my argument would be they aren’t comparable. Going from 10$ - 1$ can be effected by 1 person. 20k to 6k is the bubble popping for good.

I just need one, you think accumulating debt is comparable to slavery. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 13:14:38
Comparing working and having debt to actual slavery? Man you must have had it good in this life. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 15:32:19


Nope. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 17:57:04
In 2014 btc was at its peak of global popularity and fell from 20k to 6k? I dont seem to remember any of that being true.

This whole post is dumb. They banks will be up and running before the web will be. Linking my pc to someone else’s doesn’t grant us access to the block chain magically. And with the isps down, there’s no access, banks will get priority over personal access. And it’s not like you can spend your bitcoin at the store for water, it’s virtually worthless. 
@_date: 2019-03-12 11:47:48
Gold is worthless when there’s no water. Copper will always be needed. So will alcohol, all three worth way more than gold in an end of days scenario. Crypto is a joke, it’s practically worthless now. You buy it and your investment halves daily. The exchanges fight you to access your coins, there’s fees for every transaction too. Pretty much gold can at least be used like lead and is great for circuitry.  crypto is nothing more than an abstract thought when you get right down to it. 
@_date: 2019-03-13 01:39:03
That has nothing to do with the topic at hand. What’s your crypto worth in Venezuela right now without electricity? Zilch. 
Fwiw you shouldn’t be insulting people if you can’t follow along for a few paragraphs. 
@_date: 2019-03-19 13:18:37
Well that’s good to know. Too bad the radios aren’t working either. And neither are satellites. A country needs electric to run those things. 
@_date: 2019-03-13 05:08:24
Look at the post we’re on. These people have no electricity. They are tossing paper money in the streets. No one wants bitcoin there, they want food and water. I’m not trying to tell you crypto is a bad investment, but the conversation was based around using crypto as an alternative to cash in these situations, and you can’t, because there’s no electricity and no one wants it. This shouldn’t be so difficult for you to grasp. 
@_date: 2019-03-13 11:21:50

All good, just figured I’d let you know since you were correcting people. No shame in not knowing something.
@_date: 2019-08-17 14:10:49


Nope. “The Chinese government are bullies” is the correct way to say this. Or “China is a bully,” or even “the Chinese are bullies” 
Just figured I’d point that out if we’re playing grammar police.
@_date: 2018-06-25 18:26:53
Your graph is fake af. It jumps 1000$ in like 10 rows, then like 10,000$ in the last two. The whole thing is faked to make it look different than it really is.

TBH I don’t understand people’s regressive tendencies. Why do so many men want have issues with women’s lib? Imo it can only be that they feel threatened and somehow inferior. Personally, I think playing is more fun when everybody has an even footing. If I don’t earn my wins legitimately, what good are they?

I don’t see the problem with buying crypto on credit. I buy lots of crypto, and get rich, or it crashes and I don’t pay the credit card company and it erases from collections in a few years. Literally no risk.

Latching onto obvious hyperbole it would seem. Still though, it has fallen 6 times over the year, way more than six, I had to stop keeping track because it hurt too much, I bought at the wrong time sort of. Not ath but btc was around 10 when I bought, I spread my portfolio to alts when it hit ath I thought I was such a genius about to be rich and watched my portfolio get decimated literally 8x lol. I never panic sold though, but I did panic trade. Now I’m just waiting for it to come back. Should probably be buying. I think that dip of btc to around 3k and eth at around 75$ was the bottom. But fuck if I know what I’m talking about. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 13:41:23
Like this?
@_date: 2019-01-06 17:15:16
I trust the financial institutes more than some
totally unregulated free for all. I’m just in it for profit, fomo. What happens if the guy who made btc actually has all the keys? What happens when the tokens you buy turn out to be a scam? Crypto is just a way for shady businesses to avoid regulation, there’s money to be made off it though. If it transforms the financial landscape one day then so be it.

Is hustling crypto fraud? Op admits to user error. I don’t think it’s illegal tbh. There’s a reason the whole market is in the dumps after gaining so much popularity. It’s because everyone realizes it’s an unsafe investment vehicle. You might as well just sell guns and drugs, less risky. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 13:39:59

Look up the Dunning Krueger effect. Because no ones an expert in block chain, and op, you’re displaying it royally. As they say, a fool and his money... 
If you think 3k a share is a good buy in (it may be) then by all means, enjoy what you did. But imho 3k a share is super high for anything and btc is not going to be the long term winner. 
Good luck... hope it goes back up one day, we all do...

Demand would need to actually increase though. Just reducing supply doesn’t mean much, and if they are more difficult to sell for people in hard storage then their value will decrease. I see this killing the potential run. But I guess we’ll see.
