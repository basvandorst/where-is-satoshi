Were you even alive when those protests were going on?  You obviously don't know what you're talking about.

They don't allocate to the "best".. they allocate to the highest perceived financial risk/reward.. So if a risk or reward doesn't easily lend itself to being translated into a balance sheet, it is ignored. 
In practice this means banks give money to those who already have it because they can put money into giving off a perception of reduced risk and increased reward.  And financially this is the right thing to do.  The best predictor of success is how much money some entity already has.  This isn't because of some greater inherent value, but because of the exact point that I just made--it's a positive feedback loop.  (money/investments/assets/revenue) &lt;-&gt; (perception of success/advertising budget/time spent on pitch deck/time to polish presentation/etc.)
But don't act like banks are doing us a favor.  There's already a tendency for people with money to get more money thrown at them.  Banks are just another entity trying to ride those coattails.

But yes, you're probably right, the basic idea of a bank will still be around in some form or another

Not true.   You can buy 9 or 10 sheep for an ounce of gold
@_date: 2016-06-20 16:11:56
So you could buy 10 sheep per oz in the Islamic empire?   Or you're saying an  order of magnitude is insignificant?

What is your evidence?

I see... you were asking a question.   I thought you were making a statement

I was behind it back when it was $100.. I've just never had money to put into it.  The little money I've made off of it and eth have gone to rent.

Lol, I totally forgot about that.  What a hilariously surreal future we live in.

I wish there were some way to indicate "this rider will be tipping you in proportion to how little you talk to them"  Would be nice for restaurants, too.  I wish there were a way to indicate that without seeming totally unfriendly.  Then again, I guess it's pretty much the definition of unfriendly.

Sell for dollars and use the dollars to buy it back on the cheaper exchanges
@_date: 2015-07-23 18:36:19
That's what I'm saying.  I wish there was an option on the app that let you indicate that.   Saying that is fine,  but it comes off as rude a lot of times and makes the rest of the ride awkward

Not only that but as block rewards diminish, if they started cracking down on the large mining rigs and the prices are low, couldn't they pretty much remove all incentive to mine and reduce the transaction rate to something unusable?

Yeah, i mean, there is no society without some rules and there are no rules without some enforcement. It's just necessary to get beyond the tragedy of the commons issue.  We are bonded by mutual constraint of actions, and mutual investments offer better returns.  100 individuals investing $100 each can do less than all of them putting it together and divvying up the returns off the collective investment.  The problem is how to trust that you will get your fair share.  That's where regulation comes in. 
There are some shared investments we don't even get a choice in, so it makes sense that you are born with certain societal obligations even though you never asked for them. Neither did anyone else, and they have to breath the air, too, so don't fart in the car. 
When a company makes a risky move like putting a pipeline over a river, that risk is farting in the car.  We can't hit the company. We can't hit each individual employees, when no 1 individual shoulders 100% of the responsibility.  That's why we need regulation.  We also need a death penalty for companies... Total liquidation of all assets added to an unemployment fund. Investors lose 100% of equity. (maybe the board will stop pressuring management to make short-term decisions). 
This is really the only solution that will work IMO.  Imagine if all of BP's US assets were liquidated when they killed those 11 people with their negligence.  How different of a world would that be?

I don't know if I buy that.  It's really tempting to do things yourself when you have the time. Even things you shouldn't necessarily do.  Imagine if we weren't artificially forced to work 40 (-60) hours a week.  How much of that time would be spend doing things for yourself that you otherwise pay for?  For instance fixing your own car?  Sure, it's a nice skill to have, but it's not very efficient for everyone to be a jack of all trades, and it can be a hazard to others on the road if people are doing all kinds of amateur car maintenance. Specialization is good to a certain extent, and that requires getting people to pay for others to do things they might like to do themselves.

Seems like if you include the cost of learning how to deal with it, and the volatility, you can see why someone would charge extra.  It's convenient and anonymous for you, but not a lot of companies want to mess with it.
