I verified my info including a credit card as "backup"
There was nothing that should have raised a red flag....i waited the days required to verify the bank account. 
The buy request was small as a test, only 1.15 BTC
A company that really cared about its business would scan for "High Risk" earlier and not wait till 2am right before you should get the bitcoins....a simple email could have resolved any issues.

Same thing here!
Ordered on Monday but only 1 btc
All my info was verified but come Thurs when it should have hit my account they cancelled it as "High Risk"
All my info was legit and was a small amount so looking more and more like they mass cancelled ordered due to the surge in the rate....my order was at $217 but should have closed at $324
No response from their customer service to my emails.
Very poor experience

To make it worse after they cancel your order as "High Risk" they will not respond to your email asking how you can avoid this next time.
I am taking my business elsewhere for sure

Coinbase is really starting to look like a bad idea
Hearing a bunch of people saying they had their ordered cancelled for no reason after the Bitcoin right spiked up

Funny how you can not post to Coinbase Facebook page....the sure sign of a company that knows people are going to bitch at them often
I am sure all of use that got cancelled as "High Risk" after the rate jumped up this week would be blowing their Facebook page up right now.

Add me to the list of people that got canceled for ordering Bitcoins before the surge in price this week

I had the same problem around the same time frame
Coinbase seemed to have cancelled on a bunch of us one the rate jump happened

They finally responded....said my account was "Whitelisted" which I guess is nice
but still lost out on like $120 and the item I was looking to buy will most likely be sold by the time I get the bitcoins sometime next week.

The same thing happened to me
I placed an order on Nov 4 at $217
Was due to hit my account on Nov 8 which at the time the rate was $324
They freaking cancelled my order!   All my info is legit and I only ordered 1 BTC but they called it "High Risk"
It is really looking like they mass cancelled people due to the huge rate spike

Can not recommend Coinbase -
They cancel orders and do not provide details on why
If you email them they do not respond in a timely manner

I did email their customer support...twice
The first one was just to know how I could avoid this happening again on my future purchases
No response
