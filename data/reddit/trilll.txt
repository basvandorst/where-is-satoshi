fook me im all stuck in ltc from buying at 360 last week. fml
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:34:29
how long does a wire transfer take to clear for GDAX?
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:26:23
if you have gains of over 37k though, for example 40k profit from btc, does this push you into the 15% long term bracket then since its income? or the cap gains rate you fall under only matters on what your gross income is before the gains?
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:32:17
does anyone realistically see a major drop in the next half year or not at all? just curious what thoughts are. seems like it's gaining exponential momentum in the last month especially, but is btc due for another more significant hit, or does it simply continue to gradually and consistently rise from here on out
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:26:10
does anyone actually think that once a massive dip occurs, that it wouldn't re-correct and stabilize a bit and then continue on to new ATHs? i think thats what will happen..nobody is concerned that a massive dip will lead to a 1-2 year stall/decline on price right? im a noob and am trying to learn more about markets but clearly btc is unpredictable
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:34:48
starting on the 10th or wont really hit hard until a week later on the 18th? is CME going to have more influence or both will be major regardless
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:52:53
^this. im hoping to buy back in at 13. i see it breaking 20k in either the next week or next 2 months. but im not even sure if its going to dip down again now. i feel like it may just correct at 15. it just keeps getting crazier in the past couple days/hours
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:41:35
soon. on their way right now
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:06:41
50k by end of 2018
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:48:42
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:23:35
Ltc!! is this gonna slow down. what’s driving this exponential burst so hard. can it really keep up $50-$100 daily gains or is it gonna explode soon
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:44:12
i think it'll drop soon but after a little while it will recover and start soaring towards new ath through the new year
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:36:59
its kinda crazy how gemini is always hundreds cheaper than gdax..
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:24:08
wtf bch is selling for 9k
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:44:22
you might be right. ive never used binance before, sorry for the confusion
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:58:26
you can actually stay on your ass to do that
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:02:05
UNLEASH THE BEAST
BTC/ETH/LTC PUMP SOON
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:31:50
yes and yes
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:58:45
big dip needed. i still havent gotten in. funds taking forever to clear sigh. wanted in at 9500 days ago
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:42:45
are the fees listed or how am i able to see what they are and what the difference is in using btc vs eth? does it just warn you what the fee amount is before placing the order?
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:47:11
how long will a wire transfer to GDAX take to clear?
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:07:27
im sending those kitties to the moon
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:27:32
im optimistic in the long term that a 1k coin price difference wont matter much if im going to hodl but it still sucks to know its 1-2k more than i could've bought in days earlier. and im still waiting for more funds to clear which is the annoying part. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:06:48
god i wish i could've bought in 4 days ago at 9.5. was waiting for funds to clear into gdax
i know i should just finally get in right now, but it sucks to see 11.7. wondering if i should just hold out a bit to see if another nice dip occurs or not
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:28:46
screw it I just bought in at 300. I’m hodling
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:59:48
can i send bitcoin to someone's gdax? does that make sense at all. is there a 'gdax address' that they have i could send to?
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:56:28
i think so tbh, at least to a small extent. all the newcomers throw money in on payday
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:53:31
you think because of that it was a one time pump for ltc? did the eth pump occur because of its better tech? im still trying to understand things. im wondering if these 2 alts will pump again due to cme futures this weekend, i feel like it could be a similar weekend to last but thats just speculation without fully understanding the game still
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:50:45
i think similar will happen to last week. dip on btc and a small pump for the alts (eth/ltc)
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:26:20
i have my binance at lvl 2 now so if i want to get alts asap should i just buy btc directly on binance or is it going to be more cost effective/better idea to buy on gdax and transfer into binance
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:09:43
ltc to 500 eth to 900 ^^^^^^^^
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:40:07
if there is a crash
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:31:48
will ltc have another volatile day or is it likely stable for the weekend 
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:07:38
should i just go in right now. im telling myself to wait for another 'dip' down to sub 11k now. i finally have some of my funds in gdax and am waiting on more funds to clear as a deposit. my funds weren't in 5 days ago when the price was 9500 so im already bummed. but all i see is it climbing right now. im not trying to time it but it sucks to see i couldnt get in earlier because i was waiting for gdax to clear and now the price has risen over 2k
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:25:14
but are buys and sells really going through
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:37:51
do you hold your alts on binance or move to a wallet? im a noob and just wondering how to store all the alts if i end up ultimately deciding to diversify and get a lot of different coins
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:19:11
why bch...cmon coinbase. i bet its gonna pump, i hope it withers away afterwards
cant believe how hard a dip btc/eth/ltc took 30min ago
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:43:13
are ltc and eth going to fade away or will they likely stay around? i ask simply because these are the 2 alts on coinbase. what caused they're huge run ups last week? will they get back to those amounts over time? drop offs are hard right now on those 2
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:00:08
if i have no skin in the game yet should i just wait at this point? i know time in is better than trying to time it..its just a hard pill to swallow buying in at 16k when it was 9k and i was waiting for my funds to clear only a few days earlier. i know its unpredictable but i figure it will go back down to 10-12k before it makes a run to 25, 30, 50k? i just dont know 
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:08:55
just sucks you have to wait days for funds to clear into gdax to use, but coinbase locks in the price at the time you buy.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:58:45
eth/ltc will get a pump too as a side effect 
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:57:44
i know the purchase is instant. but can you sell your coins back like an hour later or do you have to wait days for the actual coins to transfer to you?
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:48:36
if i buy on coinbase using bank account/credit card to lock in a price, i cant sell until the transaction is confirmed which takes days right? so same day trading isn't possible on coinbase, or am i wrong? (i know gdax is instant, just curious about coinbase)
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:45:06
meh nah. 50k in 2018. entire 2018 will not fall. maybe after another year 
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:09:53
i want to do the same exact thing =/
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:01:32
bought in ltc at 180. i am ready for it go surge over 200 today
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:43:21
is there a good reason to use eth instead of ltc?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:21:02
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:38:26
things aren't going how you hoped. what else is there to say man. you can't guarantee yourself to jump in 4 days earlier and get rich. it goes both ways
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:25:07
HAPPY HODLIDAYS
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:55:29
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:50:01
maybe starting this weekend?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:39:13
hardly. btc maybe, ltc/eth among other alts are fine. they're all just following same trend atm because of coinbase/gdax sales on btc
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:11:39
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:22:22
itll happen again
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:32:26
you owe 15% on $4,100 ($80,000 total income including the 20k gain - $75,900)
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:30:50
id lean towards agreeing with you. i think it'll happen again but yes, likely not quite as strong as last week. nonetheless it was a big run up on both coins a week ago
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:04:36
id be more comfortable buying in sub 15 again today, but thats probably just picking hairs at this point. i wonder if we could see a run up to ~20k in the next couple days with futures before a drop occurs. and im curious to see how hard that drop will be (if it even happens).
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:49:42
fml i keep telling myself to wait now to buy in. i couldnt get in at 9500 because funds were taking too long to clear. im psyching myself out. i feel if i buy in now and price drops to 10k ill kick myself. i know its all in my head but it hurts to see it skyrocket 6k in a week and not get in
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:59:09
is it safe to buy a wallet from amazon?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:28:56
im waiting until this weekend to see what happens. so much fomo for not being able to buy in a week ago. but im scared ill buy the ath and then regret. i want to hodl long term regardless, i feel like value could reach 25, 30, 50k, but its scary to get in now with this massive gain over the last 24 hours. i guess since i still have 0btc, i rather not buy in right now and protect myself rather than getting in and seeing a massive dip hours later
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:51:56
if they hodl their ltc they'll be fine. who knows if it'll be a week a a year but it'll recover
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:53:04
i have to send btc from gdax to binance to be able to buy ripple right?
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:27:22
you missed two 0's
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:51:48
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:33:37
how long are you going to hold out for? is there an amount you'd like to buy back in at?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:12:53
huge bch dump and i think btc and eth/ltc will all pump hard soon after on gdax today
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:18:14
i just wonder what this dip (if one even happens) will go down to. of course hindsight is 20/20 but if only we knew back then 5.5k was the low to buy in. it seems like even 10k now is unlikely but obviously thats just because its skyrockted the past 7 days. a 4k drop could happen. but i guess im hoping to buy back in at 12k. even though i wish i got in at 9k days ago...
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:03:59
holy shit i didnt actaully know it went that low. good stuff!
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:06:07
tough call if i should get in now at 15.5 and hope for a run up in the next day, or if i just see how this plays out and if it drops down hard to ~10. im having fomo and emotions are tearing me right now whether to jump in finally. no way to know what'll happen
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:28:56
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:48:15
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:59:00
8k? it went that low yesterday? what time
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:28:10
mother rat too
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:59:00
i think all in on btc 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:34:32
what caused the ltc jump?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:27:59
if that happened, does anyone think it would recover again and re-reach ~15k levels? or would that kind of decrease just kill btc. i know the true supporters would stick around, but the mainstream and new ppl, would they lose all confidence and would we never get back to where we are right now? or would it ultimately recover and would we be on our way to 20k, 30k, 50k longer term still
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:13:39
my god it’s been a couple hours and you’re all crying about some stability. as if it hasn’t shown this level of stability for a few hours time in the past. give it a couple days to see the real futures impact, if any. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:30:57
whats causing the drop right now. any thoughts?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:23:27
thanks. i guess without advanced knowledge, my personal thoughts are that value could very well reach ~50k so long term i think im comfortable regardless. its just hard to figure it out in the interim on when to get in and emotions are taking over
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:47:30
lol when do you think its gonna get to that price level. few years? or are you more optimistic than that
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:44:41
thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:22:20
back on the way up
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:27:00
but if you are a maker then you pay 0 fees on gdax. do most sellers just not realize that? im surprised everyone hasn't just cashed in for usd on gdax and then bought btc. its just 2 steps instead of 1
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:26:26
trade ltc to btc when btc takes a bigger % dip than the ltc? is that what you're saying you do to increasingly gain a bigger portion of btc?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:46:32
is coinbase adding more alts this month/early 2018, or was there plan just to get one additional and now thats bch is on thats it for now?
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:37:56
still a nice cash out and you can get back in. dont feel bad at all
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:46:04
not at all. i think its going to crash or stabilize after this 9.5k artificial unfreezes. ltc and eth are quite strong imo and i see them doing well going forward
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:11:56
is the tax free benefit still outweighing the massive premium? i feel like i would rather just still have btc unless im not understanding something obvious
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:34:57
it will
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:52:56
i think a lot of people are holding long term but there's certainly risky opportunity to make quick cash right now. that's my goal to be honest - i'm new as well
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:17:47
why, any reason given?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:36:39
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:05:33
so would that technically be 3 different tax reporting transactions to disclose on your tax return? just curious
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:36:45
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:17:53
lol that was unbelievably silly.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:44:56
why did all my coinbase limits decrease?
i had ~4,500 left to use this week for bank account and 1,250 for credit card last night. i didnt make any purchases. now im checking 12 hours later and my limits are only 1,900 bank account and 300 for credit card.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:51:55
wow im new but didnt know gdax was so damn slow to get your funds in. if i knew this i wouldve just not bothered and paid the 1% on coinbase to do bank account lock in...i have 5k tied up pending from my bank account and its been 4 days. would love to buy right now but gdax is still showing $0 funds which sucks...
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:16:01
oh maybe i did it wrong then. i just deposited 5k from my bank account on GDAX. so i am assuming i locked in nothing and will have to buy at current price once my funds are avaialble on GDAX right?
could i have locked in on GDAX, or was that only possible on coinbase?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:30:41
i think it iwll bottom out at 8.5 very soon then stable and go up again past 11 and continue slower rising
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:34:17
no way to buy instantly on gdax if we dont already have funds in the account right?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:34:26
post of the day
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:35:58
you get what you paid for when you submitted the deposit? im probably misunderstanding. you only get what the current price is once you buy when your deposit is cleared and funds are ready right (im new, have a bank account deposit pending on gdax)
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:05:29
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:58:07
~3 hours
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:32:51
its dipped close to 9k in the past 20min. since theres no way to time it how do you recommend? buy in around 9k now and just wait for the rise past 11k again?
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:42:36
coinbase still down
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:11:05
if i buy with my bank account on coinbase is it not instant? i nkow credit card will be instant but bank account doesn't say "instantly" on the buy option. what will happen if i press buy. will i be stuck with funds waiting to transfer to coinbase, or will it lock in the current BTC price when i click buy?
