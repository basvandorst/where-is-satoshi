At the value of BTC and mBTC, they are not. This could be the problem.

Yeah first time I seen mBTC, I always deal with just BTC :) 
Anywho, from your screenshot, I can't see your BTC address to double check but maybe do that. 
Otherwise your a bit helpless. Banks normally can't help on this matter especially if the holding account is in a place like Nigeria.
Also try reach out to changelly publically. They have an active Facebook. This would look bad on them so I bet they will help. :) 
Going to look a little closer at the transaction details and confirmation see if I can spot something 
Please confirm the address for your wallet.

Is the address you sent it to the mBTC or ?
In future use coinbase. Established and trustworthy imo

Worst.... For what? xD how are you measuring? Any facts or just speaking some words you heard? xD
@_date: 2019-08-18 08:16:46
Have you tried to contact changelly? They are who was meant to transfer to your wallet.
Is mBTC same as BTC?

Not saying changelly is banking in Nigeria xD just personal experience with fraud in this area with FXLeader who shutdown and rebranded to trick more people :(

Thanks for not reading the thread. As I stated :P

Another side note. What if your phone breaks? Falls? Buddy spills a drink. You lose your wallet. I rather use a cloud provider. I use Blockchain wallet. Means less chances of errors. 
If the address is correct the question is your phone app not updating or not working then. 
BTC address is like bank account numbers. There's no magic behind it. If that address is yours then... Changelly has nothing to do with it and the problem is on your end. cloud wallet would resolve this conflict issues.

Your so funny! And specially challenged xD you clearly didn't read the tread as I stated what mBTC was before you reply. Best of luck with your trolling! xD

Never mind. Their the same from what my 5 min googling says
