First question : A bill will be made by the legislative authority of your country.
Second question : The bill will be passed by majority votes. (remember who still has the power at this point, no, not bitcoin) and reinforced by consequences. Like all laws are (ask yourself what stops people from frauding?)
Third question : Well the way you will be affected is that you will no longer be able to purchase your bitcoin without breaking the law by putting your money on an exchange (which is very easy to prove).
This is obviously very "dumbed-down" so its easier to understand. Theres alot more to it, but obviously a very real thing.
Your analogy hardly makes sense.

Ban it in enough places for it to no longer be a store of value/worth anything/get any traction. Happens slowly over time by legislation.

Implying bitcoin CAN be banned.


I dont think this is worth my time anymore. Good luck to you.


You are literally trolling, I've repeated myself many times now. Are you just chosing to ignore my previous posts or is this not even a debate anymore? Im talking to a wall


This is the most illogical thing I've heard in weeks

Banned =/= inaccessible. Try to understand..

Just make exchanges illegal. Boom, done.
