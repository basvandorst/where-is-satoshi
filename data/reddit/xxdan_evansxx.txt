It is in large part because this event undermines the perceived safety of this investment for most people.  Finex was a huge exchange... so if they aren't able to keep bitcoins safe, can anyone?  If they can't be kept safe and traded safely, how valuable can they be?
I want bitcoin to succeed, and I believe it still can, but it really is time to figure out how to build a safe exchange.

I got a FB invitation (I thought, it was an ad) to a Crypto meetup here in Knoxville, TN.  I went.
It was their first meeting and there were about 50 people.  Mostly under 30, 90% men.  There was a great energy in the room.
The people hosting the meeting introduced a couple of guys from Chatanooga who manage a sort of crypto trading group there with a membership fee.  They were sharp guys who have had success trading crypto.
The meeting lasted about 2 hours.  There were numerous cryptocurrencies discussed by name, symbol, and price movements.  In 2 hours I don't remember any discussion about what any of them actually do or what the need for them is, long term plan for usage, etc.  If anything was said about the developers, it was generic, like... they have a good team who has had success elsewhere.
The entire appeal was to get rich buying mostly ICOs and to join the club to know what to buy.  Lot's of phrases like "I got in at xxx" or "This is a X dollar coin all day" etc.  Even, "Who cares as long as you are making money?".

I would recommend using Coinbase which connects to your bank account to move bitcoin back and forth from dollars in your bank to bitcoin in your Coinbase wallet.  Then have a second wallet (there are many options).  Move bitcoins from coinbase to that other wallet then send to the sportsbook.  Coinbase could close your account if you send directly from them to the sportsbook and they realize it.
I have found it so much easier to get money onto bovada using bitcoin.  Hopefully you will find it easy as well once you get set up.

Localbitcoins and libertyX are great, but certainly not more convenient.  And Localbitcoins is going to mean a pretty big premium.  Circle might be great.

It depends on the amount of business a merchant does.  I think smallish merchants who negotiate a decent rate pay 20 or 25 cents minimum fee for any transaction.  I'm sure some pay more than that and I believe larger merchants would pay less.

If you will refer to my post, I said "long term store of value."
You may be joking, but the entire post was in response to a question about the difference in the tech between various cryptos.  If you bought at a recent price high, I hate that for you, but it has nothing to do with what we were discussing or the long term value proposition offered by bitcoin, and by no other crypto.
As far as short term speculation, almost all crypto can be fantastic for that.  Even downward price movements in bitcoin can be profitable if you trade them effectively.  That has nothing to do with the question I was responding to though.

There are umpteen times the bitcoin price dipped and did not recover?  I'm having trouble finding any more than 2 months old.
@_date: 2018-01-24 12:54:47
The story is completely credible.  I don't know the OP, but I know of similar situations.  I personally ran about 19 BTC into over 300 and lost it all within about 6 months (built over 6 months, lost in one DDOS attack over about 5 minutes).  This was when the price was much lower though.  The next time I ran my stack up I started using a lot less leverage.
I know of several stories which I find credible of 3000%+ annual gains.  I mean just holding bitcoin through 2017 was a 1500% gain.  So it shouldn't be hard to imagine crazy gains using even just a little leverage and buying some dips hard and selling some of the rips a bit.  Individual swing trades for 20x, 40x, or 50x the investment are really common.  But someone is losing on the other side as well.... there are more than a few that experience both outsized gains and outsized losses. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:07:01
This is obviously sound advice, but when do you take half out?  Serious question I end up dealing with myself....
Some say take out what you put in and then you can't lose.... Well say you do that and then what is left continues to grow....  maybe you sell enough to pay all your debt.... done, but the remainder is still life changing money.... well buy some cars and build a house with some of the profit..... ok working on it, but the bitcoin still is lifechanging money and still 80% or more of your net worth...  And it's hard to sell when you believe in it and you can't get much return elsewhere and selling creates an enourmous tax consequence.
I think a lot of people would take a lot off the table a lot sooner than the people who end up having millions in bitcoin.  If you had $200K in bitcoin around a year ago when bitcoin was $1k/btc, would you suggest selling half?  Well you got $100k, but now you would have $1.1M just by waiting a year.  So now at $2.2M, do you sell half?  That will net you around $800k after taxes, not exactly set for life money... and we are in a dip pricewise.  I don't know the exact answer, and these things are easy to analyze in hindsight, but I do feel for the OP.  It's easy to say after the fact, why didn't you take the money off the table when your stack was at it's highest.
@_date: 2016-04-18 17:33:34
Is there a less expensive option?  Anything even close?
@_date: 2018-01-24 11:49:02
Some of what you are saying is correct, but as someone else wrote, you are misunderstanding some key points.
The public trust in bitcoin does give it value.  What excited me about bitcoin was the fact that it was stateless money, which couldn't be shut down by any government or large institution.  I also loved the technical properties and when I began investing the fees were lower.  Those fees, even then, were not lower (for me) than credit cards or cash though... that was never the main value driver.  Security and decentralization are paramount.
No centralized project, regardless of the tech properties, can replace bitcoin as a new form of stateless money.  It will be nearly impossible to recreate the genesis story and get to this point with a new tech.  Even though many products work toward decentralization, it is very hard to achieve enough to really be hardened against government action.  If a handful of people being put in jail would dramatically affect the project, it's not awesome as decentralized sound money.
I'm not against other crypto for other purposes.  I am cheering for the entire space.  But it is extremely likely that these cryptos will be priced in bitcoin and bitcoin will be around long term as a value store at the very least for people who value security and decentralization above all (and there are many).

If you have enough money and don't need anymore, why sell all your bitcoin?  It's not binary, you can sell as much as you need to or want to and hold some as well.  These guys have all they need either way, but I do think they really believe in the long term prospects for bitcoin and they want to be a part of making that happen.  They were talking on television to serious minded reporters about a $40K/btc valuation years ago when bitcoin was only a couple of hundred dollars.
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:44:01
That is a very good question.  No, it's not just based on popularity.
The genesis of bitcoin is really unique because of the anonymity of Satoshi Nakamoto.  Cryptocurrency was basically just a science experiment for a few years.  There was some really truly organic growth for years without any obvious effort from the founders to get rich on the project.
It will be nearly impossible to duplicate a similar genesis story with a new project.  All projects naturally start as centralized.  Even Bitcoin was just a few people at first.  The fact that Satoshi Nakamoto has over $10 Billion in bitcoin that he never moved means he is likely dead, or perhaps the group that is Satoshi made those coins intentionally unretrievable forever for the good of the project.
The idea behind bitcoin was to create money that could be moved peer to peer that no government or large organization (banks, etc.) could stop.  If a project has a handful of people that could be jailed which would effectively stop the project or destroy its value, it doesn't meet that objective.  I really think Bitcoin is the only project that passes that test right now.
The arduous process to implement the SegWit upgrade really demonstrates how difficult it is to make protocol level changes with bitcoin.  It is very easy to make major changes on more centralized projects.  The difficulty to change things is actually a feature and not a bug with respect to what we are talking about.
It is not impossible that another project could become as decentralized as bitcoin, but it is very unlikely.  I don't think it would happen simply because of lower fees or faster transaction propagation.  If you think about it, those things can almost always be improved by whatever coin is the newest, but it makes no sense that the newest coins would be the best for long term value storage.  You need one long term stateless ledger to price things.  Analog, that is gold, with little real competition for thousands of years despite other metals with more rarity, etc.  Time itself makes it stronger in it's role.  First is a really big advantage for this specific application.

Anyway.  I definitely don't keep much on my phone.  I break my BTC into increments of 21 or so and store on multiple hardware wallets (backup hardware wallets for each private key) which I keep in safe deposit boxes.  So for anyone to get over $1M USD worth of my Bitcoin we would have to go to a bank and access a safe deposit box.  I am not advocating going around bragging about how much bitcoin you have, but I don't think people should live in fear because they are multi-bitcoinaires, at least if they live in the US in a safe area.

Where would you suggest a new person in the US, who is nervous but interested in getting into Bitcoin, buy their first bitcoin?
IMO, there is no better answer than Coinbase.  I wish they were better in many ways, but I still think it is by far the most appropriate onramp for friends or family who aren't tech savvy, and who would never use localbitcoins, to buy their first bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:30:10
At least in the US, I find this idea that the only thing that can keep a rich person safe is anonymity, ridiculous.  It is extremely easy to locate people who have money.  Most of them aren't afraid to share their name, live in a nice house, drive a nice vehicle, etc.
When you come into wealth quickly, there can be issues with friends and family though.  Sometimes they will expect/hope for you to share the wealth with them, especially if they think you just got "lucky".  For example I think many would expect someone who hit the Powerball jackpot for tens of millions or hundreds of millions to spread millions around to family and friends.

Problem with silver is that it isn't really rare.  People used to think so and that is where the gold/silver ratio came from.  It's industrial use would value it much lower.  It's honestly not a precious metal and in the long run the market may figure that out.  It looks cheap, but it only has value because people believe it does, and much of that is because they think it's rare, but it isn't.
Gold is legitimately scarce on earth.  Different story there.

Interesting quote that 3 out of 4 Americans haven't even heard of Bitcoin.  In my experience, most who have heard of it, really don't have even a basic understanding of it.  That's where I was for the last few years.
I actually remember a friend who was talking about considering starting to mine bitcoin a few years ago.  I couldn't put my mind around it (he didn't explain it well honestly), and I think if anything I was discouraging toward him pursuing it.  I hope he went for it anyway (we have lost touch).

I honestly can't see much reason to buy bitcoins to hold right now other than you expect their value to be higher in the future.  Why are you saying that people should buy and hold bitcoin?
You could have a wallet like Coinbase or Circle and be ready to buy if you need to for utility, but why actually hold coin other than anticipation that it might increase in value?
The belief that the technology is sound and worthwhile in the long run is the reason to expect the value to increase, but I'm at a loss as to why you feel it's wrong to be straightforward about the real reason people buy and hold bitcoin.  I do agree that saying buy these to get rich is a little over simplistic (as well as tacky, and uncertain), but I pretty much think the site says that anyway, just in a better way.

It's like Apple in 1976, but the guys who say it is going to be worth $10K+ in X years are nuts?  
Seems to me that if what you say is true, they will be right.  If Bitcoin is like Email or Apple in terms of growth, those numbers aren't silly.  I'm not saying it will be like that, but you were, except you seem to think that would only mean modest price growth somehow.  I think it could be something like that.  But really only modest adoption in the long run is needed for this price to be very cheap.

Speculation playing less of a role is subjective, and yes it is probably true.  The price is still mainly driven by speculation though (my opinion).  Maybe instead of 99% speculation it's 90% speculation.
That said, it seems that organic growth in usage is getting closer and closer all the time.  I think things look pretty good going forward, and there seems to be less and less risk of bitcoin being a totally failed experiment in the not too distant future (still could happen).  So it may be a bit safer to "speculate" and pick up a few coins at current levels.  It's still so early with this technology.

He is saying that the miners expenses are going up (electricity costs) and so they are selling coins to cover their expenses.  I think it is a reasonable hypothesis.  When the coins were much more valuable than the expense to generate them, perhaps more coins were held.  Right now, there is little profit in mining, and probably many more coins are sold to at least cover the expenses.  I think there is evidence to this effect.

The exchanges won't help the PayPal issue as far as I can tell.

I hope the core devs can reach a consensus solution and communicate it to the community soonish.

Similarly, everyone shouldn't have to jump because of whoever says it's time to go the soonest or for the biggest blocksize.  Please, talk this out and communicate a consensus solution which will be implemented under whatever timeline you can agree to collectively.  I am certain that you can do it.  Everyone should offer what they feel is the right solution both now and for the future, then reach a compromise incorporating as many good ideas as possible.  Thanks in advance!

I think there has been an increase in bitcoin adoption in Greece, but that is not the main reason for the increase in transaction volume.  It's mostly related to an increase in trading volume.

If 10% of the wealth of Greece was converted to Bitcoin, you would see Bitcoin values over $50,000.00 USD.  This currency is extremely small in it's current adoption and the total value of all Bitcoins in existence is only a few billion dollars right now.  View that as undeveloped potential, or as a testament to it's failure, but it is what it is.
In truth, just a few of the wealthiest in Greece deciding to diversify some of their wealth into bitcoin would make a significant difference in the price.  Or even 0.1% of all Greeks savings would be a huge influx.

Your question presumes they are not.  The price movement has changed from basically down to fairly flat.  Smart large scale investors know how to buy without moving the price too much.  They don't just jump on an exchange and put in market orders for thousands of bitcoins.  That might help you, but it doesn't help them.
Real big buyers do not try to force the price up.  They try to move in quietly, but there are signs if you know where to look.  The OTC market is also very important.

This is not the same as government trying to regulate bitcoin directly.  Expecting exchanges to not cheat their customers or allow blatant cheating is reasonable in my opinion.  I am skeptical that the SEC can be very effective in eliminating the manipulation across the board, but even shedding some light into the darkness could be a benefit.

The miners are bullish on bitcoin despite recent price drops... most of them understand the bigger picture and don't watch the charts minute by minute to decide if they want to build a larger position.  And even with the price declines, they can mine profitably at this price level.

I agree.  Time is needed.  The general public does not understand this at all.  I was in that category until about a month ago.  I had heard of bitcoin, but never really investigated it.

Price should precede adoption.  That's a high bar both ways though, so it's close.  Obviously it could be that neither ever happens.  Assuming 1 does eventually happen, I am going to guess that 2 happens first.  Purely a speculation.  Kind of interesting question though.

There are a lot of coins being sold right now related to mining.  Just paying for electricity using bitcoins mined would lead to most of the bitcoins being sold.  Approximately 3600 coins mined each day, with most being sold, creates some downward price pressure.  Less coins mined will almost certainly take some of that pressure off.  The price effect may not be seen at the exact time of the halving.  This is only one factor of many, and markets tend to anticipate these types of events, especially when it is a known event like this.  It could be that the market will run up ahead of the event and then retrace after, for example, because the market overestimates the effect that the supply reduction will have.

The way to make money with arbitrage would be to sell GBTC and buy bitcoins or BIT at the same time.  It really doesn't matter that you have to wait a year before selling more GBTC (if you go that route with the bitcoins), you make the spread immediately really.  As volume increases, the premium is going to come down.  Either the BTC price will rise, or GBTC will fall, or both.  May take a little time, but if there is volume in GBTC there will be correlation in the prices and a tighter spread.  And the GBTC volume is obviously already picking up some.  It's wrong to completely dismiss the GBTC trading, although really it's still very early and the volume is still relatively light.

You would not.  But they say they aren't selling them, but instead just giving them away.
There are people who mine with old technology even though they aren't breaking even.  And I don't think their target customer would be an existing bitcoin miner.  Probably just people who have some curiosity about bitcoin and technology in general.
Some people would buy them for the novelty of it.  I think it sounds pretty cool.

Anyone advising not to pay for the house in full to save the bitcoin should also advise people to mortgage their house if paid off to buy bitcoin.  It's the same thing really, but I think many people would not advise borrowing money to buy who are advising borrowing money to hold.
There is value in not being in debt for anything.  I don't like to part with my bitcoin either, but if I had 1,000 I think it might make sense to not be in debt and to diversify.  I expect bitcoin to outperform real estate, but that is a lot of eggs in one basket and if that represented 90+% of a persons net worth they really should diversify.  Save some bitcoin by buying a less expensive house perhaps.

The gap will close a good bit in the next few weeks/months.  I'm not saying that the gbtc price will fall, but I am saying the gap will close a good bit in my opinion.  Honestly, the gap has to shrink if gbtc trades with any volume.
For the most part, people would probably do better to buy bitcoin directly, even if they later sold that same bitcoin and bought gbtc for the tax benefits later when there is not as much of a premium.

If bitcoin is validated by NASDAQ, and more people understand it and believe it to be a safe and stable system, more people will be comfortable owning bitcoin.  It is more important for the image of bitcoin, in my opinion, than for the bitcoins required to operate this type of validation system.  But I do think it is important, especially if they move forward after their experimental stage.

His point: Bitcoin went wrong because people tried to get rich off it.... but digital currency and digital transactions are definitely the future.
Could someone tell me how these currencies of the future will be developed without anyone involved with a profit motive?
His other point is that bitcoin hasn't been widely adopted, therefore it is a failure.  I have to agree that it really hasn't been widely adopted.  Personally, I just bought my first bitcoin this year.  It wasn't very easy and I don't expect to use it much for purchases yet.  I am more interested in bitcoin as a store of value and as a speculative investment, but I realize that the technology is amazing and expect infrastructure to develop and for adoption to improve.  It's actually not too hard to see that happening.
Thank you for posting this video.  I really do think it is important to hear from all sides.  Bitcoin still has a long way to go, but I am impressed with it and think it is probably just a toddler right now.

That analysis is purely technical and automatic.  It changes constantly and it has technical analysis for a variety of timeframes.  It's pretty interesting if you enjoy technical analysis.

We are getting closer... but... you are still stating things as facts that are actually unknowable.
Increasing the blocksize might not directly attract adoption, but do you allow for the possibility that a small increase (as well as a civil discourse and perceived compromize) could alleviate the fear of many and drive speculative investment sending the price higher.  The higher price could lead to more spending of coin, more merchant adoption, new speculators and investors, press, etc. etc.?
I'm not saying that would happen for sure, but I don't understand how someone could know that would not happen to any extent.  You would also lose some users and maybe some nodes or miners.  So would the gains in users, nodes, miners from increased adoption be more or less than the losses?  What is the perfect balance?  It's not really knowable honestly.  
I think when prominent key developers talk openly about selling their coins and giving up on the experiment if this or that isn't decided in the short run in the way that they believe it should be decided, that is not good for decentralization (there were threats on both sides).  Listen, I think they should totally be able to sell out and move on at anytime, but the public discourse was so bad....
I totally agree that there is alarmism.  I see it everywhere.  It isn't helpful.  I think there is also too much certainty expressed on both sides.  I would love to see more open mindedness.  For example, I think that it would be helpful to know that if the network really became crippled by transaction load from massive adoption or from a new pricing bubble, and if the more elegant long term scaling solutions were not yet in place, that we could quickly come to consensus around a simple small block size increase.  It's hard to have confidence that would happen though because of how inflexible some appear to be based on their communication.  Maybe that scenario never plays out.  People should be open to that possibility as well.

Look, as volume increases and/or enough volume is traded over time the prices of bitcoin and 10xGBTC will come much closer together.  This doesn't mean GBTC will come down to 1/10 the current price of bitcoins.  That's not the only way for convergence.... just sayin'

As an investor and bitcoin believer, I honestly want both.  But if I could choose only one, I would choose $5,000 per coin honestly.  Self interest over the greater good I suppose.  I don't see how they could ever really be accepted and cheap at $5 per coin though.  I can imagine another price bubble even if the technology is ultimately replaced.
@_date: 2016-03-27 05:49:04
If there is massive interest in Bitcoin, more people will host nodes and more people will mine, etc.  If there is little or no interest in Bitcoin, even if it requires very little computational challenge to performing these tasks, less people will perform them.  If bitcoin becomes worthless, or even simply declined tremendously in value (say $2 per coin), you would see a lot of centralization in my opinion as many leave the space entirely.  Does this help in explaining how coin value and adoption have a lot more than "literally nothing" to do with the decentralization of the network and its nodes?
It is amazing to me that so many can't understand that there is an economic component as well as a technical one.  Demand for the cryptocurrency is not a given and it isn't constant.  It is clear to me that Satoshi and others understood this and wanted to encourage adoption and not discourage it.  This means how communication is delivered as well as the code implemented are both important.  Even the idealists and purists should realize that bitcoin usage matters.  The world will not be changed by a brilliant technology used by only a few.
I think it will all work out, but there is some merit in things being said by many on different sides, and its not as simple as some make it (on both sides).

What is the perfect size block for maximum decentralization?  Is even a possible slight reduction in decentralization ever worth considering for massive improvement in utility?  Do you believe adoption and the coin value are also important for decentralization?  
This issue is more complicated than to reduce it to the idea that any blocksize increase would hurt decentralization.

The GBTC premium going away does not automatically mean the GBTC price would collapse.  The BTC price could close the gap very quickly and I believe the announcement of an ETF would be quite a catalyst.  I do agree that the gap would close and I also am surprised by the size of the premium.

I am really not the person to ask.  I do think this all could have been coordinated and done by now in a way which would be more satisfactory had everyone been working together toward that end.
I personally don't have a problem with 2x now.  I have a problem with moving forward while most of the technical experts are warning that it is reckless and too fast.  I know that many dismiss their warnings as for political reasons, and perhaps that is true in some cases.  It is hard for me to dismiss all the warnings from so many of the key developers.  There is clearly not consensus about moving forward at the proposed pace within the development community.
From what I have read, the logic behind more time is this:
We need to see how SegWit and lightning impact the scaling for bitcoin.  How much demand can be shifted?  Are there unexpected issues?  What type of congestion and fees develop after some relief to the system?  What do peak demand times look like and how quickly is the mempool emptied during low demand times? etc.  While SegWit exists on other coins, you really can't simulate the level of demand that exists on Bitcoin.  It makes sense to want to see how it works for a bit and to see how the larger blocks created by SegWit impact the network before going even larger.  I don't know how long this would take, but it is probably significantly longer than 3 months.  Maybe 12 to 18 months at a minimum.
Also, since contentious hard forks should be avoided, and there are many potential upgrades which would require a hard fork, it makes sense to get as many desired upgrades as possible into this fork.  I know there is a wish list out there, but that list isn't exactly the same for everyone and some of the code doesn't exist yet or hasn't been adequately tested.  I don't know how long it would take to get a reasonable amount of this done, but right now nothing is going into the 2x fork besides the blocksize increase.
I personally understand the frustration with seemingly open ended delays.  I do think many core developers tend to err on the side of conservatism and I would like to see more scaling sooner than later.  That said, I am loathe to impose my judgement on them, and I am not confident that I know better than basically all of them at this point.
You mentioned Bitcoin Cash.  I think it is becoming very clear that even though only a few changes were made in that fork, at least one of them has created unintended and ridiculous consequences.  Just look at  and tell me you think the EDA was set up in the best possible way for something intended to replace bitcoin as the future of money.  This stuff is complicated and the people who talk about certain proposed changes like they are no big deal are increasingly losing credibility.

1. LOL
2. Really with the knowledge of a certain drop of 25% you should back up the truck and short bitcoin for everything you can.
3.  In case you are serious, there are tax consequences to selling even if you are able to buy back lower and there is absolutely no guarantee you will be able to buy back lower.
4.  Right now I would definitely sell some for $4300-$4400 and buy lower.  I don't think I would hold out for $3k.  Unfortunately those prices aren't being bid at this moment....  So yeah, if I could go back in time and sell that local top, I would, but I would be adding here.

Or, by the time the block reward expires, we would need 60 MB blocks with 5 cent fees.  I don't understand why that might not be reasonable at that point in the future.  I can understand not presuming it will be reasonable, but it is possible that size will be trivial to handle by then.

"If you have suggestions on how to further increase SegWit2x support, please
let us know.  Let’s get to 100% consensus."
I think the best way to increase consensus would be to delay the 2x fork and try to incorporate other upgrades at that time.  Of course this will not guarantee 100% consensus, but it would very likely lead to more consensus than currently exists.  Allow time to see how scaling develops with SegWit, what the market decides about Bitcoin Cash, lightning implementation on some level, etc.  Perhaps you could reach out directly to key Core Developers to see if there is a roadmap for a future fork that would make more technical sense that they could support.
It is really hard for me to see how you feel there is currently broad consensus without the Core Developers, most of the exchanges, and clearly a large number of users.  I would like to see more consensus before another fork which would potentially change Bitcoin significantly forever.
I personally want to see additional on chain scaling on a consensus hard fork as soon as reasonably possible.  I wish you the best in working toward that.  Please do not give up on obtaining more consensus!

Your edit is correct.  You come out ahead in terms of btc by withdrawing when btc is lower than when you deposited it.  Btc is trending up pretty strong right now though, so you might not be able to do that.  You could wait for a level that never appears.  
There are many better ways to try to trade bitcoin than timing your deposits and withdrawals.  Generally I like exposure to bitcoin more than to USD, so when I am not using the $$$ on bovada, I move it into bitcoin.  If you can pick a dip in BTC price for withdrawal, all the better.

If you liked circle I believe you are likely to like Coinbase.  I know that many here are against Coinbase for political reasons and they are KYC/AML compliant (but Circle was as well).  Not a great wallet for use in illegal activity, but a very simply platform to buy on.  Save a little by using their GDAX exchange.  Coinbase will be the most similar to what you are used to and they work well for many people.
If you are comfortable with buying on an exchange, Bitstamp works well.  I believe Gemini is fine as well if available where you live.  These are options for purchasing near the market rate with a lower fee than you will experience many other ways.

You are correct.  These types of events do help people realize the value of owning an uncorrelated asset like bitcoin though and highlight the potential issues with fiat money.  I think in that way it reinforces beliefs held by existing bitcoin bulls, perhaps causing them to buy a bit more.  It also exposes potential new users and investors to the idea of bitcoin.  Clearly there has not been a mass exodus out of any national currency into bitcoin though (what starts as a trickle, can grow though....).

I don't understand why discussion about xt is banned, but you go into great detail with your thoughts about it.  It's like you just think one side of the argument should be banned.  
You have a lot of opinion here which you represent as fact and as the last word on the subjects.
I am undecided on the debate about xt, blocksize, forks, etc.  I don't agree with your decision about how to censor this.  It definitely seems like (based on the tone of your post here) you are censoring people because you disagree and think their ideas are bad for bitcoin. That really shouldn't be the standard.

I don't have a problem with discussions of some altcoins if it is related back to bitcoin.  For example a comment like "bitcoin could learn x from how y handles that" should not be stricken in my opinion.  If someone begins to spam stuff like that, maybe, but I don't think the mention of an alt coin should be automatically deleted.
Where do you think the line should be drawn?  Should your post be deleted because it mentions alts?
I don't think xt should be treated the same as those alts anyway though.  Creating a coin through a fork (or changing bitcoin through a fork) is not the same as creating one from scratch.

Were there people telling you to sell it for USD or for BTC?  If you sold for BTC, you shouldn't be very far behind where you would be had you held, unless you sold near the absolute bottom.

"There's nothing in the fundamentals of the bitcoin market that point to a real uptrend. The only possible change in the market is the New York regulations that will be enforced in late August. Aside from that, nothing has changed."
What timeframe are you talking about here?  Over the last 12 months I see a lot that is different fundamentally (with the landscape of investment and development in this space.).
Honestly I don't think this move is nearly as related to Greece as you think.  If it is related, it is just that it has made some people really think about money and value storage and has given exposure to bitcoin (it's not because Greeks are buying lots of bitcoin).  Technically, there have been many indicators that this could happen.
I appreciate your thoughts... it's just that mostly I have been reading so many posts over the past few months basically saying "with all this good news, why isn't the price higher" so that sentiment is contradicted by the idea that nothing has been changing.  
Price discovery is not instantaneous.  New money, especially smart big money, tries to enter without moving the price up.  That can only go on for so long though, before sellers become exhausted at a given price level.  It really looks to me like bitcoin has been under skillful accumulation by people who realize that the foundation is being built and who have patience to see price momentum build over the long run, instead of through impatient buying based on fear of missing out (they let others do that later).
I'm guessing a pullback here, stabilization for a few days, then up again.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:25:07
How do you understand this will work in practice?  Put another way, when is the "settlement price" that they reference here going to be considered?  If only on the actual settlement each month, these are waaay to restrictive.  They call that price the "final settlement price" somewhere else, so I am thinking these limits are recalculated more often, but it's not super clear to me.

My Dad was falling all over himself to have me buy 10 for him this weekend.  I was like, I'll do it, but I need to have the money to lock in the price.  He was like, "How much is it?"  $253, $258, $263 at different points we were together....  He didn't have cash on him, but will be sending some to buy "at whatever price it is at when you get the money".  He's not really a major risk taker, and actually this represents only a very small part of his savings.  His plan is to buy and hold long term, hoping for a huge return down the road, but willing to lose it all as a speculative bet.
@_date: 2015-07-06 01:40:21
It's still mostly speculation.  That doesn't mean it isn't real.  Speculators are increasingly confident about bitcoins long term potential.  Price increases will continue to anticipate future adoption, not the other way around.  Actual usage really isn't driving the price fluctuations much except to the extent that the trends influence investment.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:21:57
If the futures were deliverable instead of cash settled to an index, that would solve the problem created by price explosion.  You would still need to keep margin requirements high for something this volatile.
Segregating the pool would at least localize any problems.  This would probably lead to lower margin requirements by some brokerages.

When someone buys something, does a fraudulent chargeback (done all the time) then buys something else, to me that is a double spend.  I really don't see the difference.  Both types of double spending require dishonesty, and in my experience it is extremely easy with credit cards and fairly difficult with bitcoin.

You are assuming the bitcoin price is constant.  If bitcoin price more than doubles every four years the block subsidy will be higher than it is now.  If you want to make an assumption about price, it makes more sense to expect the block subsidy to be higher than it is now after the next halving based on historic price performance.

I noticed there were several prominent ads outside Golden Gate about accepting Bitcoin on Fremont Street.  It's sad that they would spend the money on the ads and not take the time to educate the staff.  I was thinking of trying to stay there in the future.  It would be nice if they would let you take a marker against bitcoin as well, perhaps transferring it to a wallet they control but not converting it to fiat unless you need to do that to settle up.  I would think there would be some bitcoiners interested in that proposition because you might not have to convert any if things go the right way.

My impression is that he would be fine with layer 2 if it was in place right now solving the problem.  I do think there is a trust issue with core and Roger.  
@_date: 2017-04-27 20:00:47
I remember Roger talking about introducing people to Bitcoin by hanging out at Starbucks and telling people about how they could save money buying coffee by using bitcoin and an app that bought Starbucks gift cards for 80 cents on the dollar.  The giftcard was loaded onto your phone and you sold back whatever you didn't use.  I never used it, but it was a pretty cool use case for Bitcoin.  It was a solid example of Bitcoin saving people money with relatively little hassle on something they were buying anyway.  This might have been Purse, or if not it was something similar.
Anyway, Roger was quite a Bitcoin evangelist and some of what he preached about Bitcoin is really not true right now.  The use case I mentioned wouldn't work well now because of the transaction fees.  I think Roger really believes bigger blocks would work well to allow Bitcoin to still be useful for small payments.  I think he also really believes that bigger blocks are being thwarted because of the Blockstream business model and influence on Bitcoin Core development.  So even though he believes Segwit would help, he opposes it because he doesn't "trust" Core and he thinks adopting Segwit makes it less likely for larger blocks to be adopted as well.
Obviously there could be more sinister motives, but I don't know why there must be.  Both sides tend to assume the absolute worst about those on the other side of this debate.  I don't think that is helpful overall.  There is a ton of confirmation bias in Reddit conversations.
I am not endorsing Roger's analysis, but I think this is where he is coming from.
@_date: 2017-04-08 04:13:23
$2k if it simply does not self-destruct.  No major changes needed, just no bad changes.
If consensus was reached on scaling, I think $2k would be very low.  The odds of strong consensus being reached is extremely low though.  If it happened you could see a price spike like in some of the alts (2x to 10x).  That can still happen in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-03 02:01:58
It's not identical, but it is similar.
The periodic table does not limit the number of metals.  You could say the laws of physics do, but not the periodic table.  Heavier metals have been created in particle accelerators and discovered in nature over time resulting in amendments to the table.  Individual elements have isotopes which have properties which differ from one another even though they have the same number on the periodic table.  There are a virtually infinite number of metallic alloys as well, which combine elements, but are unique materials.  There are certainly alloys which are more valuable by weight than the constituent metals.
All that said, I think gold is unique and has lasting value.  I don't think the value is destroyed by the variety of other metals and alloys available.  The supply of gold has impact on its value, and while that supply is certainly finite, it is not completely known.  Gold is legitimately rare on earth (unlike silver, for example), but there are scenarios where gold can be produced from other materials in a lab.  This can't be done economically right now, but that hasn't been done at all with bitcoin.
I also think bitcoin is unique and will have lasting value.  Alt coins aren't bitcoins.  Trust creates the value more than physical properties with money.

Yeah.  Both would pull in new money from different places.  It's hard to know for sure which would bring in more.  I think either would provide a similar sort of credibility for bitcoin.  I'm pulling for both.  I think bitcoin becomes more interesting and effective for many use cases with a much higher market cap, and it would benefit me personally financially as well.
@_date: 2017-04-25 23:27:46
You share the risk this way.  When you borrow the money and mine yourself you take on all the risk.  I don't know about the math in this case, but I have some experience with mining.  Difficulty changes quickly and your profit margin can drop a lot faster than you anticipate.  There are people who offer cloud mining who could get loans instead who are not running a scam.
I'm not sure what his motives are or whether this will be a good investment for anyone or for Roger.  I do think it is not helpful to automatically assume the worst about everyone on the other side of the scaling debate.  At some point we will need to come together and constantly labeling people crooks and liars really is not as helpful for winning others to your cause as redditors seem to think.

Too many people put too much stock in the mood, for lack of  a better word, on Reddit.
I think there are a lot of serious people in the space who spend little time reading Reddit, and even less time posting.

The issues aren't limited to Bitfinex.  Other exchanges with similar banking arrangements are having the same problems.  Outside of the wire issue, I'm not sure there is any evidence of major problems.
The situation is causing additional buying as people use their fiat to buy bitcoin and pull the bitcoin off the platform.  Some of this bitcoin might be moved to another exchange and sold, but some will be stored off exchanges entirely.  This action will result in net buying and upward price pressure.  As long as fiat can't be moved by wire and significant fiat balances remain on bitfinex (as well as significant short positions) the upward pressure should persist.
@_date: 2017-04-02 22:57:28
Are you trying to say that gold is more easily spendable than bitcoin?  You might want to research that.
Your question about the creation of altcoins and their affect on bitcoin is a legitimate one.  It is similar to considering the mining of other metals and the impact on gold.  So long as gold continues to be the one people consider to be the best store of value it will continue to be just that.  
Gold is not nearly as rare as rhodium.  There are shinier metals (prettier to many), metals with greater industrial demand, etc.  I'm a fan of gold because of its history, and historically it has been excellent money and a good value store, but your analysis comparing gold and bitcoin needs an update in my opinion.

Other coins may prove super useful for certain use cases.  Some may immediately be significantly better than Bitcoin for certain things and may find rapid adoption and price growth.
That doesn't mean Bitcoin will become irrelevant though.  There will always be value placed on the coin which is the most decentralized, and that quality in Bitcoin is almost impossible to replicate with some new centralized project.  It would take a long time.  Also difficult to beat will be the perceived security (and actual security) of Bitcoin due to its longest history.  The genesis of Bitcoin is unique and really can never be repeated.  It makes a lot of sense to have at least one long term crypto ledger which remains in place because of the trust people have in its history, not because of the tech specs or new bells and whistles.

Other than signalling NYA, which seems to mean different things to different people, have you seen statements from miners that they will completely abandon mining bitcoin and solely mine the 2x fork?  We saw with bitcoin cash that many chose to mine what made financial sense.

I don't know for sure if we are near the short term bottom.  Maybe, there has been a lot of selling, so at some point you have seller exhaustion.

@_date: 2017-09-27 09:00:28
You are interpreting signalling "NYA" to mean that they will devote 100% of their hashrate to the 2x fork coin for an extended period of time regardless of profitability.  I don't think many of the miners who signed believe that is what they are committed to doing.  The BCH fork and shifting hash tells the real story.  Miners will mine what is profitable.
But I do agree that if 95% of the miners mined 2x indefinitely with all their hashrate, it would create a huge problem for the legacy chain.  I just don't agree that will happen (or even that they think they agreed to that).

Some precious metals merchants charge a lower fee for using bitcoin instead of a credit card.  I have used bitcoin with moneymetals to save some.
There are some things that are difficult to buy online with USD for legal reasons.  Bitcoin is popular for that.  I haven't made any purchases of that nature, but I have funded poker accounts and the fees were much lower and the process much faster than attempting to use USD (very hard to do with a credit card, and expensive and cumbersome to use MoneyGram).  
I used bitcoin to buy some trezors after trying unsuccessfully to use 2 different check cards.  The charge was in Euros and without telling my banks first, they declined the international charges.  So bitcoin had an advantage for an international purchase.
I have used bitcoin to pay at a restaurant and buy movie tickets, but I don't think there was any benefit to me.  The vendors saved some money though because their fee is lower than what a credit card company would charge them.

Depending on the future prices of gold and how much more demand there is in the future for Bitcoin vs. gold you can pretty easily imagine a forty-fold to one hundredfold increase in price over the long run.
@_date: 2018-02-20 07:39:31
Yeah, bitcoin would only be valued like gold if major institutions like governments, banks, large funds, etc. hold it.  Be on the lookout for signs of that.

I'm not for 2x, but I don't think someone is an "enemy" of Bitcoin simply for being in support of that route to scaling.  Some of these issues are complicated and there are many different reasons why someone might support 2x.

CME and CBOE Futures.  You access them through traditional futures brokerages.  Even ETrade has a futures platform, although there are many better options.  You can find a full list on CMEs website or just ask a few brokerages you are comfortable with.
These aren't the most liquid places to trade, they aren't 24/7, and they don't allow much leverage.  That said if you are wanting to trade short as a US citizen with almost zero couterparty risk and without deceit, I think the new futures products are your best option.

You are supposed to have a Money Services License to sell bitcoin.  Being on LocalBitcoins doesn't change anything about the existing laws.  The laws are rarely enforced, but they are very clear in my state (and probably in most).
It's not an enormous task to get a proper license, but obviously many don't bother.  These aren't new laws, so I don't see any reason for you to panic sell or attempt to create panic about them.  They will not be the end of bitcoin.

I think it is definitely worth it.  No matter what the price of bitcoin does (I expect it to continue to rise over time), you will benefit from practicing saving and investing.  These are disciplines few have.
As far as this particular investment, I think you are getting into something relatively early that is possibly going to be very significant.

Really though, why would this be the time?  I mean this is basically a correction because the price got ahead of itself, especially in the alt market.

What are you going to do with 81 Euro?
To me, I basically hold until I can sell a small percentage and buy something worthwhile for cash, like a new car or a house.  I do convert most of my trading profits into cash as well to pay bills and buy stuff or diversify into other asset classes.  I converted all of my Bitcoin Cash and more than half of my free Byteballs.  I also look for opportunities to get return on my bitcoin through lending, etc.
Basically I hate the idea of selling a lot of my bitcoin for a small short term return if I don't need to do that.  It's still very cheap if it has long term relevance, and right now that seems more likely than ever.
Whatever you decide, good luck!

It is hard for people to understand that while cryptocurrency is not scarce, Bitcoin is quite scarce.
Similarly, the crypto space is full of scams, but Bitcoin is not a scam.  
These concepts are not easily understood and embraced, even though they are true and objective research will allow someone who wants to understand the ability to realize these things.  The fact that so many people will continue to have trouble creates an opportunity to front run their investment.

I remember talking to one of my 8 year old boys about the condos in Dubai that were for sale for like 72 bitcoins (at the time around $80k total).  He said, "That's too high.  Who wants to spend that many bitcoins for an apartment."  
He's only 8, but he was right on that one.  Now it would only take about 10 BTC.  Probably still too high long term.

How much new money per day do you reckon it would take to go over $20k/btc in a sustainable way?  How much would you think might be coming in now? in the future?
I think you might be underestimating the amount of money with interest in the space, or might misunderstand how much is needed.
@_date: 2017-09-27 12:49:14
I don't think it will come to that anyway, but any real solution for losing almost all hashpower all at once would require a hard fork.  So you would have a legacy chain, a 2x hard fork, and a core hard fork.  In the short run, I think that would be bearish for price.

If you had simply FOMO bought every so called bull trap for the last 2 years then held, perhaps taking some profit at 2x your entry (like sell half and free roll with the rest after 100% gains), you would be killing it.  I realize there are a few buys which would be underwater right now, but overall you would be slaying it.
Obviously it would be better to buy dips instead, but the "bull traps" in bitcoin are almost always only short term.  You want to be a bull, trapped or not, in bitcoin long term.

I don't think it is a bad idea to put some of your profits into other investments, and I used to get excited about buying gold and silver with some of my BTC as well.  So seriously, congrats on your profits!
For me most of my metals were purchased when BTC was around parity with gold.  I'm ahead on my gold which has moved up around $100/ounce since then.  My BTC has gone up around $10k (nine-fold) over the same time, so the gold feels pretty expensive if I think about it too hard.
Similarly now my wife and I are building a house I would never have dreamed we would own, paying in full with cash from bitcoin profits.  We are still keeping most of our bitcoin but this seems like an enjoyable way to diversify some.  Still... I can't help but think this house is going to have cost us tens of millions equivalent within a short period of time.

It's hard to move enough volume to make billions even if you are very accurate at predicting price movements... but yeah self made millionaires in short order.  And that does happen a good bit more in this space than any trading environment I have ever seen.
@_date: 2017-10-06 09:02:12
No.  It won't trade at 1.  But you are correct about this pricing being important.
Basically the key is to see if there is enough market support for the 1x or legacy chain to entice enough mining to keep it from becoming unusable.  There is enough support.
It is interesting that the 2x coin doesn't even seem to have majority support in the market.  When people put their money where their mouth is, it does not seem there is a real expectation for 2x to become bitcoin and see the legacy chain and the core devs go into a death spiral with no miner support etc.  You can choose to believe silly narratives on social media, but that futures market will tell the basic truth in the end about actual demand.
@_date: 2017-10-06 01:44:20
Well, you are not simply betting that S2X will exist, you are buying that coin.  So in your example you would base your offer on the expected price times the chance of it happening.
For example, if you think the chance is 50% likely and that the price of a single S2X token would be $2,000.00, you might be willing to pay up to $1,000.00 for BT2.
With the previous chainsplit tokens there ended up being an artificial floor on the minority token.  It's easy to make a market if a token goes cheap enough and simply hold the other side hostage.  My advice is to be prepared to hold until the end, because the market for this type of product can go illiquid and doesn't always reflect the ultimate pricing.  That said, I do like these and think they help with price discovery.  So far this reminds me very much of the Bitcoin Cash chain split token trading with respect to price action and volumes.
@_date: 2017-09-12 07:31:39
Still early.  Investing any amount is fine.

Not the ones I'm most concerned with.  And not in equal amounts.  The Wall Street money is weighted significantly toward bitcoin.  Bitcoin is actually scarce.  Cryptocurrency is not.  I do agree there is spillover and I do agree that there are people who prefer to invest in alts.

There are investment pools which will not consider investing in assets under a $100B USD market cap, so this is actually a relevant threshold to break and maintain.

I saw a lot of this.  Well done.
One thing I would like to see is more effort to combat the 95% of hash will mine S2X narrative.  Based on statements from F2Pool, Bitfury, and Slush we really know that isn't the case.  It's also reasonable to assume other miners will mine S2X to honor their word but also mine Bitcoin to make money.  As was rightly pointed out, in the long run the miners will mine the chain demanded by the market (reflected in price).
I think hashpower is important, and I personally think if 95% of the hashpower instantly flipped to S2X and stayed there no matter what the financial consequences, it would be extremely bad for bitcoin, especially in the short term.  The thing is that doesn't seem likely at all based on what miners are actually saying.
In a way the false narrative can be profitable for me personally.  The so called "free money" is only available if people believe they should pay for some alt because it might become the real bitcoin. As a believer in this project on a more fundamental level, I would like to see this campaign of disinformation about what the current signalling actually means be met with facts more often.

The miners don't think that signalling "NYA" means they must mine S2X exclusively, forever, no matter the financial consequences.  Many will mine S2X some to honor the agreement, but they will mine whatever the market pays for them to mine as "Bitcoin".  This narrative that high signalling on "NYA" means the legacy is DOA ignores what many of the miners are actually saying with their mouths and their keyboards.

What do you mean no censorship is occurring?  I'm not sure if you are referring to something more limited than this sub.
@_date: 2017-10-07 06:22:33
Bitcoin Cash has an EDA which prevents it from becoming worthless through a death spiral.  Bitcoin and S2X will both use the same POW, but likely will not have the same value.  So if miners mine what is more profitable and largely abandon the other, the minority chain could literally die.  This could happen to either chain, but it looks like there is more market support for Bitcoin (legacy) right now, so it is conceivable that 2x could crash hard.  There is also the chance that miners don't care about money much and will mine 2x because they just hate core and really don't like censorship or something, but I find that unlikely.
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:48:10
This is correct.  One thing to be careful about is exposing your private key to an unknown wallet.  A single key will work for multiple addresses.
So, for example, if you move your BTC on a Trezor from one address to another on the same Trezor (two addresses using the same key), then put your private key into some online wallet for the fork chain - you could be at risk.  So to be totally safe if you are going to put your key somewhere which could create a risk, move the bitcoin to an address with a completely different key (like a different Trezor for this example).
@_date: 2017-10-07 06:39:00
To honor the agreement, do you think they must mine 2x exclusively, at a loss, forever?  If they can mine both for a bit and then eventually follow the more profitable chain.... I think they will.

I am in favor of the version of Bitcoin currently supported by Core remaining Bitcoin after any near term 2x fork, but I am not in favor of anointing Core the permanent keeper of the brand.  I think it is constantly up to the users.  Right now it is clear the users prefer not to rush an upgrade when the majority of the technical experts warn against it.
I think even many from Core would not want the responsibility of determining what is "Bitcoin" for the entire community.  But they know that many respect their opinions.

That is completely subjective.  Have you studied the other fork communities?  They are all minority forks.  There is a lot more technical merit behind some of the others.  I have definitely looked at the BCH community as it represents itself on Reddit, and while I agree that there are ideologues, I don't think that means it is the "real Bitcoin". 
It's fine to say Bitcoin sucks and Bitcoin Cash is an improvement and will be the future of money or whatever.  I totally disagree with that, but it's not outright lying to people.  The Bitcoin Cash community is the only one insisting on doing that.

Once I got everything set up I was able to complete a purchase from HodlMonkey with a network fee of 0 Satoshis (ZERO!).  To my eye it was instant.  Really, really cool!
It took me some time to get the channels set up right so that I could get this done.  Ultimately I think adding the vendor channel directly is probably what made it work and probably why the fee was 0.  There were fees to get the wallet funded (9 cents) and a few cents to get each channel set up.  Overall fairly trivial expenses to get set up for nearly free and instant lighting transactions going forward.  Thanks for making this a reality!!

I agree that those altcoins would probably not even exist without Bitcoin, but I don't agree that they gain value because of Bitcoin.
First of all, most really don't have much value at all.  Long term the price of most will approach or equal zero.
I think the market phenomenon is that actually people buying and holding alt coins has put a net positive pressure on Bitcoin.  People exiting alt coins into fiat (often through bitcoin) has put a negative pressure on Bitcoin.  People trading alts see it as the other way around (bitcoin's rise pushes them higher, bitcoin drops are why they are dropping), but on a fundamental level I don't think that is what happens.
So we have a situation where there was/is a huge crypto bubble, even though Bitcoin itself is probably pretty cheap long term.  The market has been sorting that out and it has been a painful process, but a necessary one.
I don't think encouraging people to invest in alts actually is helpful to Bitcoin's sustainable long term price growth, even though I do think it has a positive effect short term.

In lightning channels.  You have an option to paste an address to add a channel, so first you need to copy the address then select that.
@_date: 2018-04-04 22:44:48
I got it figured out.  Works if you open a channel directly with the vendor.  You need to allocate a certain amount of funds for each channel you open, so be careful not to allocate everything to your first channel or you may have the problems I had.
I have since initiated closing my first channel with ACINQ and it seems to take some time.  It says CLOSING (uncooperative).  I'm just hoping to close that in order to distribute the funds over a few more channels.
Overall I am super excited about seeing this roll out further.  It's only going to get better!

If something like this were implemented, it would show confidence in the longevity of the blockchain and it's long term security.  It would not directly result in mass purchase of bitcoin though.  Even the fact that it is being studied or considered shows a level of confidence that bitcoin is here to stay.  That may already be obvious to some, but others are skeptical.
This is just my opinion about why things like this matter.  I agree with generally about the Reddit community, although some are helpful here.  I think this community also really underestimates how large the community of bitcoin users and investors that are completely unaware of Reddit or rarely visit is.  There is a lot of information that ends up here, so I find it useful, but all should be careful to overly concern themselves with the opinions here.

GBTC has generally traded at a significant premium to BTC because of the process used to create additional shares.  I don't want to get into the weeds, but you can research it further.  It doesn't act as an ETF.  The GBTC volumes aren't sufficient to move large amounts of money in and out without significant slippage either.  That said it can be held in many retirement accounts, etc.  The fact that it trades at such a significant premium to Bitcoin shows that there is demand for a product like that.
The CME and CBOE futures products are more liquid, track the price more closely, etc. but they are settled regularly so aren't ideal for buy and hold long term.  These products are still significantly less traded than the spot markets which have much tighter spreads, etc.
There is a bit of institutional money invested directly in spot.  The OTC markets and various BTC exchanges are different from what fund managers are used to dealing with, so there are only a handful who are pioneering into this new animal.  So there is a trickle of money which I believe personally caused much of the price rise last fall, but there is still a wall of money waiting for a more appropriate onramp, like a proper ETF.

Should Bitcores, Bitcoin Private, Lightning Bitcoin, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin God, etc. also be thought of in the same way?  Should they all promote themselves as simply "Bitcoin"?  Should they tell people they are buying "Bitcoin" when they buy their particular fork coin?  Why is Bitcoin Cash the only fork which should be able to call itself "Bitcoin" and why should supporters of that minority fork be allowed to rename Bitcoin as they see fit?
The way consensus works is not that everyone gets their own version of Bitcoin to do with as they please and tell everyone it is the "real" Bitcoin.  There is only one Bitcoin.  The rest is deceptive.

I use it for online gambling.  Much, much better than any other method to move money onto and off of poker sites.  I've used bitcoin to buy stuff as well, but it really has only had a legitimate practical advantage for me personally with online poker.
I think it is a nice store of value as well, "digital gold".  It's an asset not correlated closely to other assets which has some advantages in a diversified portfolio.
It is still good for doing things your government might not like.  Examples would be moving money out of China for a Chinese Citizen, or donating to Wikileaks for a US citizen.
I agree that it isn't great right now for microtransactions and I wish it were more anonymous.  Those things may work really well with further development though.  I would think sidechains and the lightning network would provide some functionality in those areas down the road.  I really believe that over time there are a lot of possibilities which aren't even discussed much now because of limitations which will not always exist technically.

You can open up a channel with some of these vendors directly.  There are addresses at 
It may work for you if you just try periodically, but I didn't have success until I added the vendor channel.  In my case it was the one for HodlMonkey.  I had trouble getting the wallet to take the address for Blockstream, but it may have just been a copy paste issue.  Also, I put all my funds into the ACINQ channel so then had to add more funds to open new channels.  If possible it may be best to spread funds around.
One last note... I tried to close the channel with ACINQ in order to distribute the funds into multiple channels.  So far it hasn't closed the channel and I don't have access to the funds at all anymore.  I added more, but this is either something that just takes some time, or maybe is a bug of some sort.  It says in yellow "CLOSING (uncooperative)".  It's been a few hours now.

Tried HodlMonkey as well.  Still failing in the same way.

The price you can buy at right now will very likely not be the lowest price ever available.  It will also very likely not be the highest price for bitcoin in the future.  It is almost impossible to time a buy perfectly.
Dollar cost averaging will make it less likely that you make a very poorly timed buy but will also limit the likelihood of making a very well timed buy.
I would recommend making a small buy and then watching closely.  If price pulls back hard you may want to buy with a larger amount of fiat.  If price continues to rise, average in on the rise.  This way you will not miss the entire run if we keep going, but you give yourself a chance to buy a dip.  If it never comes down to these levels again you will not have made the optimal purchase, but I don't think you will mind.  If it pulls back hard you will not have bought too much at the top.

There has been communication on Reddit and elsewhere.  No real new developments since the last announcement though.
@_date: 2017-05-22 08:05:29
I remember reading that at the time and I appreciate the time you put into that explanation.  I thought it was an excellent plan forward.  I guess the key part to answer your question would be:
"Bitcoin will be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the risks of not deploying them. In Bitcoin Core we should keep patches ready to implement them as the need and the will arises, to keep the basic software engineering from being the limiting factor."
I had the impression that you may feel the risks are too great to help with the 2MB HF part, but I may be misreading you or imposing others thoughts onto you.  Your response to my question seems to indicate that you would be willing to help with that, which I think is fantastic.
You mentioned trying to have patches ready, which is also encouraging.  Do you have something ready to go which might be helpful?
I understand that there are risks associated with any blocksize increase and with any hard fork.  I know there are some who would not take those risks under any scenario.  I don't believe that is your position.  I would love to see us risk a modest blocksize increase and well planned and well developed hard fork in the future if there was broad consensus to do that (I believe actually there would be if you said it was safe).  I believe that you can be a hero of sorts in a scaling resolution and I hope that it works out that way!
Thank you for all of your efforts on behalf of Bitcoin and its users.  It is clear that you are brilliant and passionate and that you have worked very hard.  We are better off for your efforts.
@_date: 2018-04-06 19:14:49
Can you tell a little more about the closing of channels.  At least a couple of us have them sort of stuck open.  They are labeled in yellow "CLOSING (uncooperative)"
I'm thinking that may resolve on it's own after some period of time... days maybe?  If anyone knows I am curious.

It seems like the strategy of 21 is to increase the userbase of bitcoin overall to reach a critical mass where some of their other applications will be more effective.  It seems like a fairly long term strategy which may not be especially lucrative for 21.co in the short term but is probably good for bitcoin overall.  Their efforts alone will not get bitcoin where they need it to be, but if bitcoin becomes significantly more mainstream they may find themselves well positioned.
@_date: 2017-05-09 18:56:07
The price doesn't go up because of technological progress with the protocol.  The price goes up because there is more demand than supply.  
While some people may be waiting for the scaling solution to be finalized before purchasing more bitcoin, obviously many are not waiting to buy.  Presumably this is because they are either unconcerned with these issues for their purposes or they speculate that it will be worked out at some point and they would rather buy at a lower price now.
Bitcoin is used more now and is more in demand now than at any time in its history.  It makes perfect sense that the price is at the highest point as well.

Would you be willing to help write and/or test appropriate code to get Segwit implemented and create a 2 MB HF at a later date?  Probably further out in time and possibly incorporating other important features that require a hard fork.  I feel like if you were willing to do this we could move forward with broad consensus.
@_date: 2016-05-03 20:49:02
He might be trying to decide whether or not to move some coins.  If so, I think I know what decision C. Wright is rooting for.
@_date: 2016-05-06 23:59:50
Withdrawals are available in bitcoin.  You must make a bitcoin deposit first though, I think.

I don't see how you could accomplish multiple transactions with a single vendor with zero fee right now without the lightning network even if you open a channel directly with them.  So it would still improve the current situation and take transaction load off the main chain.  But yes obviously the networking needs to fill in.  I'm assuming that as more nodes are added and online with more capacity and routing software improves in the lightning wallets it should get much better over time.

Bitcoin is by far the most secure, protected by far by the most hashrate.
Bitcoin has by far the most real world use, and has proven itself in this area.
Bitcoin is the oldest.  This can't change and the other two are not likely to change anytime soon.
Money, especially when used as a store of value, has value because of the trust people have in the money.  I think there are many reasons why people would put the most trust in bitcoin both now and in the future.

I actually appreciate the restraint in not responding to every accusation that they are lying and scheming and will not do what they say.  The back in forth on that isn't productive.

If you can't give the price for Peak on this Bubble, please at least give the exact date.  Car gives a range for the price peak, but I am not sure I will be able to sell the exact top based on what I am seeing here.
In all seriousness, thanks for this!
@_date: 2017-05-10 02:34:59
Why not use some leverage as well?  Say 20x short from the top and 20x long from the bottoms.

I agree that the decision the exchanges make is the most important.  Obviously they will listen to their customers and the larger community. No one "owns" the name, but I think if the exchanges were in agreement about what is "Bitcoin", that will be key.
@_date: 2017-05-21 15:31:00
I don't think it will drop at all.  That would be bullish.  The exchange prices will converge very fast.

Right now it looks like nothing.  SegWit will be locked in safely before that and there will be no split.  Miners will need to signal for activation as they have indicated they will.  Many have started already, but we aren't at the activation threshold yet.
@_date: 2017-07-17 13:44:25
Higher fee per transaction does not necessarily equal higher fees overall.  You could have higher fees overall by including a much larger number of transactions at a slightly lower fee.
Also, miners want bitcoin price to rise as their main source of income is still the block reward, so they make more from the value of bitcoin than the fees.
Miners want bitcoin to be relevant long term and competitive against alts.  There is clearly a need for more capacity.  Miners would like to see as much as possible that the scaling is on chain directly where they can profit instead of only in secondary layers.
@_date: 2017-07-06 23:00:33
At least one says it should be smaller.
@_date: 2016-05-10 00:30:36
In my opinion, the current price is much closer to "nothing" than "a lot".  I still think he is right in principle, but maybe off a bit on the timeline.
@_date: 2017-07-28 01:53:05
It will not dilute the amount of btc.  It could dilute the value some depending on what value the market places on bcc.
@_date: 2017-07-18 00:15:46
That was literally the biggest dollar gain for a single day in bitcoin's history.  You don't think it has anything to do with the FUD around SegWit activation dissipating?
@_date: 2017-07-17 02:49:56
They are signaling NYA at a huge percentage (like 90%).  It's not their job to try to tweet the price up.  All they need to do is what they have said repeatedly and consistently that they will do and SegWit will be activated in about 1 week.
Buyers and sellers who rely too heavily on social media are easily manipulated and that is often exploited.
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:02:16
most have started signalling early.  The date you are thinking of is July 21st.
@_date: 2015-10-28 23:54:53
You can't really speculate yet in a big way (at least not in the way traders are used to doing in volume).  If that infrastructure is built, the traders will need enough bitcoin to gamble with and it will almost certainly drive the market cap up.  $4B is really nothing.
@_date: 2017-05-09 11:32:24
That is a sound strategy.  I was just joking with you.
@_date: 2016-07-04 15:32:18
What investment vehicles/stores of value do you think is more "fair"?
@_date: 2016-07-12 23:07:48
The supply isn't unlimited, but coins can be added.  Bitcoin is fungible and it will not create a subset with a different value.
@_date: 2017-06-11 23:24:07
Rules are different for a hedge fund vs mutual fund.  I would be surprised if any mutual funds own bitcoin and if they exist we should know by now.  Hedge funds have more operational flexibility and it makes sense for them to enter this space first.  I agree with your assessment.  There is soooo much money still on the outside, but with increasing interest in crypto.
