How are Gates (a software guy with a company that did well) and Zuckerberg (a website guy with a company that did well), financial investment geniuses? Aren't they more like businessmen with successful products?

You could sell half of it and still have double what you put in if you sell at around 16K. Take some profit and reinvest that in something less volatile? 
I mean, if you want.

I'm fine to hodl with what I have for the time being.

Tell yourself that a month ago when BTC was at 8K USD.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:21:34
I have no idea. I just do it. Maybe because I use Coinbase?

You should also have 5 bch then. Sell it on gdax and have a little mad money for yourself! ��

So what you're saying is that I should quietly sneak up behind my wallets while they're just chillin' and place some cucumbers just outside of their peripheral vision?

I have a family lawyer that I'm sure will help for a fee. But I think his endeavors won't be required if I'm reading the tax code right. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:30:04
Oh yeah. I'm not disagreeing with you. It's happened way too many times for me this last couple weeks to be a coincidence.
I used to be a casual holder. I have an automatic buy of btc set up on a weekly basis. Every once in a while I'd open up my coinbase wallets and redistribute my crypto to be more even between btc, eth, and ltc but I didn't need to go on an exchange.
Then day after Thanksgiving my SO winds up in the hospital. Gets out, can't work for who knows how long. I gotta sell some of my crypto to pay bills. Kills me to do it, but the timing is pretty good so I go to gdax to save a little on fees and this shit keeps happening and happening to me.
I'm exactly the kind of small time customer that gets screwed over by them. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:44:57
I've always felt this way about BTC, but I've been small potatoes as a buyer/holder for a couple years now. I've used Coinbase because it's convenient and the interface is really simple for someone like me.
It's only really been a month now where I've been beginning to realize that I need to move my coins out of coinbase and store them properly. I think this is the case for a lot of people.
It's important to not just educate people on treating their crypto with care and being their own agents of change with it, but to also provide alternatives that work just as easily for the average yokel as coinbase does but without the bank-backed centralization middle man.
Do that, and the revolution will be full sway in an instant.
But right now, things are pretty stagnant for BTC.
Don't get me wrong here. I'm pretty sure a nice Nano wallet is on my Christmas list and I look forward to to having my own keys to my own coins, but if bitcoin is to truly become a viable currency, it's going to need to have an entry-level interface grandma can access. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:59:37
Shouldn't be happening here. There *is* a sub for it, though: r/bitcoinbegging/.
I dunno. Take a look at all the people posting today realizing they have bitcoins from back in the days when the tipbots were around, hoping to recover them. It's a thing, it happens. People have a need, or otherwise offer something another finds worth handing out some BTC for.

Why didn't they do it when the fork happened in the first place?

I tried to buy during that dip but GDAX took a big old crap and my order didn't go through. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:35:29
It never hurts to diversify. Just, like everyone says, don't put in any more than you're willing to lose. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:50:53
Omg don't fret over it. Buy now and HODL if you're in for the long run. My advice, such as it is, is get in there, buy what you can, don't overestimate what you can afford to kiss goodbye to and hold on for a few days. Surface for a breath of fresh air, and reevaluate then 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:16:49
I'm pretty sure that's just because the listing is alphabetical.

@_date: 2017-12-11 03:16:24
I'm wondering the same, but my alts really haven't moved too much today, so I'm hodling it all. A rising tide lifts all boats and all that. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:11:57
Funny thing was earlier today I was thinking that I oughtta get away from these guys then lo and behold this crap happens. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:52:58
You sure can. Coinbase and GDAX aren't allowing trades for BCH right now, so you'll want to move it out of coinbase to a different exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:54:53
Alright, here's your capital gains tax question of the hour: 
I made less than 16k usd this year in wages (like, just under that). I've been buying and selling coins willy nilly all year but I don't have any gains over 5-6K usd for the whole year. Will I owe anything at all? I'm thinking that my petty investments in crypto still keep me under the threshold to pay capital gains taxes.
Am I wrong here?

And LTC. Thought I'd buy me some cheap LTC while waiting for things to unfreeze on GDAX, but nope.

I think the dip is now. Pre 17k USD. Where were you when btc was pre 17k?

Sure. Come to Michigan. I can wrangle some people. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:36:44
It's certainly beginning to look like that's the case. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:00:48
I went through this a few months ago even though I've been using Coinbase since 2014-15 and none of my account info changed. Took two, three weeks after contacting customer support to clear it up.
Good luck!

Yes, Cartman's coin would have some kind of truly reprehensible name and go really big for a while, eclipsing bitcoin, resulting in all the characters saying his coin's name repeatedly along with news reporters, etc, then go bust when someone (maybe someone unexpected like Butters) hacks all of it away from Cartman and dumps it on the market for a fraction of its value, using the profits to buy some toy Cartman is lusting after.
And Randy panic sells all his BTC, buys something stupid with it like a boat he doesn't know how to pilot, wrecks the boat because he's drunk on some insanely expensive craft beer and everything returns to the show's status quo except for Wendy, who bought a bunch of Chickcoin, and it's doing okay. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:57:40
Well, if you're just getting started, IMO coinbase/gdax have their drawbacks (mainly crashing every time volume goes up), but they're easy to use and once you iron out getting accounts on other exchanges you can easily move on at that point. 
And just getting started, I'd stick with just a few coins for now anyway. I went altcoin crazy back in 2013 and didn't really get anywhere with it. Right now I just have BTC, ETH, and LTC. Thinking about maybe getting some Monero, but it's not that pressing for me. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:51:44
I've bought as little as .0025 BTC on GDAX many times.

[Doug Flutie Jr. Foundation](
The Doug Flutie Jr. Foundation provides grants to groups and individuals in order to help children with autism lead fuller lives. I like them because there are tons of research organizations out there, but very few that actually aim to do anything to help those that already have and are living with autism. 
Unfortunately it doesn't look as though there's a means to donate with BTC... 
EDIT "Flutie" not "Glutie" lol

Why does this ALWAYS happen when I'm too fiat-poor to buy more? 
Just gonna HODL what I got, I guess.
