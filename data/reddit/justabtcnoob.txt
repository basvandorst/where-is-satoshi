Well, I've read probably a couple of hundred pages on bitcoin over the last two weeks as well as listened to around 20 hours of podcasts and youtube vids and read many hundreds of reddit posts. Despite having an IQ of 133 (decently above average) and a reasonable general understanding of the big picture issues in I.T. I must still rely on my 'instincts' when commenting on or otherwise judging bitcoin. If I wanted to *really* come to entirely my own educated conclusions I would have to learn the following to PhD level:
Elliptic Curve cryptography;
Keynesian economics;
Contrarian economics;
Finance law;
.... and goodness knows what other tricky subjects!
I'm not sure *reading* would cover it even if I had 20 years to dedicate to it!

The first two transactions resulted in me having a balance of 0.0063btc in my hot wallet. Balance is now 0.0013btc and the third tx wasn't me. It wasn' ME! lol

Some systems don't automatically add the transaction fee. If the fee is not added to the transaction miners have little to no incentive to confirm it hence the delays.

I think it's its own monster right now. Fundamentals are being defined for btc for the first time and on a daily basis.  Intraday trading would be only for the very risk-loving or ultra-skilled traders right now! However, a small stake might be worth a flutter provided you remember to place a stop on any open positions!!

Yeah, the *fear* is real but the severity of the *actual threat* in real terms is limited to potential double-spending within a 10-min window of opportunity...which kind of eliminates the chance of a 51% attack *for the purposes of making profit* - at least that's what I understood from listening to Andreas answer that concern! lol

Dude, the price fluctuations are still incredibly small given the novelty of btc and the uncertainty of the regulatory environment / ongoing MtGox case etc. 
All 'stock prices' are subject to the two key price-motivators: fear and greed. Greed motivates purchases when 'bullish' and fear motivates selling when 'bearish'. Buying --&gt; Increase in demand = increase in price;
Selling --&gt; Decrease in demand = decrease in price.
I wouldn't worry about it at this level of fluctuation!

Oh, and something bitcoin something something.
@_date: 2014-03-13 16:27:31
Ah! Ok... so, buoyed-up by the possibility I'm not as thick as I thought, I'm wondering: Both public and private keys are currently only on paper, if i receive btc to one of the public keys and then want to access those btc, what system is it that asks me for my private key and / or how do I decrypt it?! &gt;.&lt;

Mining's 'sexy' cos it's a pure tech solution to making money while sitting on your backside. Unfortunately, like all highly coveted jobs, there are many applicants and many of those are likely better qualified than you to gain a foothold in such a limited market....
Meanwhile, there is an entire universe of new possibilities emerging thanks in part to the efforts of the miners... 
I know I've missed the boat for becoming a mining-millionaire and my mind is already beginning to invent ways to be part of the new paradigm in some other way. 
I think buying and holding a % that you can afford to sit on is good. ALSO good is spending them, tipping small amounts to scared noobs so they can experiment and, of course, EARNING them! 
In short, i think the best way to participate is in as diversified a manner as you are comfortable with and that allows you to take proper care of each aspect. Damn! It's full of exciting possibilities!! Good luck!

In a possible universe in which the blockchain reliably proves transactions? 
@_date: 2014-03-21 17:41:16
No cos the public key is enshrined in the blockchain as an integral part of the ledger.
@_date: 2014-03-18 12:09:28
Thanks. Seems a little costly at present in that case? 
@_date: 2014-03-13 23:37:06
Blockchain.info need to sort this out as it's been raised a few times now and causes unnecessary distress. automatically includes the fee and reminds you about it if you try to withdraw ALL funds with no margin for the transaction fee - so it's definitely do-able easily. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 21:35:31
Hear ya, dude. The *trustless system* is a bit of a chimera: 99.99% of users will **not** understand how bitcoin actually works and so will have no choice but to trust in the (human-designed) system. Anyone who puts themselves in the position Andreas has will be criticised as a 'self-appointed demigod'. My judgement is that he has balls and i really hope that what he says is 'true'...like most of us I lack the ability to analyse the bitcoin ecosystem in deep technical detail for myself. I have little option but to trust...
@_date: 2014-03-13 16:15:32
Hi - thanks for the reply. What I meant by 'where does the decryption occur?' is 'I'm incredibly thick and struggle to visualise things from descriptions!' lol

By 'downloaded' I take it you mean 'paper wallets' ? They are more secure provided generated fully offline and the private keys never go online until the moment you transfer the funds somewhere. 
Keep only a small amount in online hot wallets - like your pocket wallet.
Re 'days to update' - did you include transaction fees with each tx?
I think key differences are that you retain 100% control of funds in paper wallets at all times but relinquish a degree of that security and control for any funds held on an online system (even if you have 2 factor authentication in place). Online funds can be spent quickly whereas offline funds will be a little more of a palaver to access.
@_date: 2014-03-13 16:22:56
Wow! How does this work?!? (This bitcoin stuff is the best fun I've had in ages! lol)

This. 
I would hope that a masters thesis on bitcoin, at this stage of its development, would explore the potentially revolutionary nature of the underlying technology of which bitcoin (and altcoins) are the first applications. The emergence of a *trustless concensus distributed* asset ledger whose reliability is based on *cryptographic proof-of-work* presents so many paradigm-changing  opportunities whilst at the same time throwing up a wide array of potential problems that must be properly addressed...
Good luck and keep us updated! :-)

Where did the chart come from? Bitcoinwisdom shows the lowest recent dip as 578 at 1430hrs on 20th... ?? I've noticed a few $$ differential between btcwisdom and zeroblock but literally $2 or $3... is there another ticker I should be watching?!! 
@_date: 2014-03-13 16:35:39
Great advice! Thanks for helping to clear this up for me! 
I'm definitely taking the advice of starting v small, verifying my familiarity with the systems and proper functioning of the encrypt/decrypt sequence and the various hot wallet options before investing more than a very few $! :-)
@_date: 2014-03-18 20:31:00
It's a good point you make. Thing is, with btc, just as with any new technology, if you're just one page ahead in the manual than the next person, you seem like a bona fide expert! Andreas is a good few further pages ahead than most of us and we're all desperately playing catch-up! 
@_date: 2014-03-13 20:00:00

The resiliency of the btc price has been remarkably high *despite* the various recent 'losses'. 
If a person or group 'knew' that their theft of massive amounts of btc would harm the price, they would also likely 'know' to hold onto the coins they steal until the price recovers *sufficiently* and then trickle-sell to cash in on their victory.
The average person (whatever that really means) was afraid of / indifferent to the internet 25 years ago...
Why steal a whole exchange of coins? - Because they **could**!! It's not as if they could only fill the one lorry with so many btcs and then had to leave the rest - a small usb drive would accommodate the whole lot! 
I actually believe that all publicity is good publicity at present as each instance provides a public platform for elucidation as to how centralization does not engender trustworthiness and, conversely, how distributed systems can prevent future abuses...
@_date: 2014-03-18 20:56:29

*" Also his site severely damaged the reputation of bitcoin. "* 
Absolutely not the case! Quite the opposite in fact. SR *proved bitcoin works as a payment system*. The bitcoin community is indebted to Ulbricht, whether they care to admit it or not. [edit: if he is, indeed, the DPR of SR!]
As to him being a 'criminal' - how would you like to be tried and convicted in a kangaroo court?! His crimes are 'alleged', not proven!

The current price fluctuations don't signify a 'crash'. The movement has been in the order of approx 12%. For **such** a new instrument this is hardly a major concern, especially as the general trend is one of *daily increasing adoption*. Personally I am pleased to see this type of fluctuation. A really serious drop at this stage would be down to something like $400 or below, at which point I would be **buying** a lot more than I am right now!! Enjoy the rollercoaster dudes!
