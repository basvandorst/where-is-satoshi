That’s not going to cause sudden, mass unemployment.

The problem with this analysis is that CC debt isn’t a bubble. This debt has a fairly predictable level of defaulting which is being accounted for by the banks. It’s not like houses either, where banks loan people hundreds of thousands of dollars and then acquire an asset on default that is maybe not even worth the amount of money they paid out.
Most credit card default begins in the 1-2k range, people on their first or second card. People who build up good credit ratings to get the bigger limits are far less likely to default, which is why they get the higher limit. So say Sally buys 2k worth of stuff and spends a couple years paying off the minimum at 19% a month before declaring bankruptcy. Say her minimum was 100$ for that bill. That’s still 400$ of profit based on the initial cost of the loan to the bank. It’s not like all the sudden hundreds of millions of dollars of credit cards will suddenly be not paying their bills and cause the banks to go under like nearly happened with houses. Credit card debt is stable due to its relatively low value and volume.
Most of these figures are also massively inflated by people who end up owing 200-1000% more on their credit cards than their original expenditure.

There were plenty of people who were posting when it hit 12.5k that they were investing heavy as a good buy spot. Those people have just taken a 25% hit on their investment, and that’s best case.
So yeah I wouldn’t be surprised why people are kind of upset, even if these swings have become predictable and why bitcoin is hella fun and shit your pants terrifying at the same time.

Yes, but the factor that could trigger that calamity would be mass unemployment or runaway interest rates. At that point, credit card debt is not really your biggest concern.

That’s exactly it, banks and lending institutions are making money off the credit card business and it’s extremely unlikely that would change. It would take a massive, sudden mass unemployment type event to actually break the market. 
I think a lot of people get caught up on CC debt because of the ‘08 crisis. No doubt debt is bad on a personal scale and one should always avoid it as much as humanly possible within your means, but credit cards are not going to be the downfall of Western culture unless something crazy happens, like banks forget about risk scaling and give high-limit credit cards to high risk users, which is pretty much what happened with the housing crisis.

Realistically does bitcoin have legit users though? I feel like we are a long way off. The only goods I’ve seen bought with BTC are illicit things, and I know some people in digital trades will accept them instead of pay.
Personally I’m not so sure that BTC is viable as a currency unless we see a split that brings its value back to a realistic comparable to other currencies, but I’m not sure how that works with the way supply of BTC works.
I just can’t see mass adoption when most transactions will take place in the thousand/ten thousand/hundred thousand decimal Range.

Inflation would imply that the relative value of the currency had been diminished, deflation is the opposite.
If you think a currency where the difference between typing .0050 and 0500 can cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars is viable as a mainstream currency is viable, you’re crazy. The average person is too stupid to do basic arithmetic, there’s no way in hell they will be able to make basic transactions dealing in the tenth million, which was my point about it being untenable for its original purpose(which was to create a worldwide, decentralized currency independent of banks and national interests). 
That doesn’t speak to the core underlying concept as much as it does the current state of the market pricing and long-term outlook.

My favorite thing about these posts is the sheep who don’t realize Bitcoin is the ULTIMATE FIAT currency, by its very nature.

I’m under the impression that a good bulk of the altcoins and the volatility of bitcoin is entirely decided by the established financial institutions realising that the crypto market is their wet dream in the sense of being able to manipulate the market to generate millions of dollars in wealth in ways that are simply not possible in the highly regulated securities market.

I never said I don’t believe in it, I just said I think that it’s current market value is driven by low supply and high demand from speculation. I think it’s overvalued in terms of conversion rate to other currencies based on this, and thus why I think for it or another crypto currency to truly work, the price of bitcoin is due for massive correction or replacement with another crypto, as it’s just not scaleable. 
Why would I come here to troll? I don’t get how that analysis indicates I “don’t believe in bitcoin”.

What makes you think it’s super undervalued? If anything it’s super deflated, which is nice for holders until it corrects itself, but makes it untenable as an actual currency rather than a speculative market.

I disagree, it highlights Bitcoin as a volatile investment for wannabe day traders or people who heard about it at Xmas and figure they can ride the waves.
What will be good for Bitcoin is less Wall St. speculators looking to manipulate an unregulated version of the stock exchanges and sucking in middle Americans into their wake, and more functional uses for people who want to use it for its intended purposes.
As long as it’s as volatile as it is currently in terms of /USD it will not be useful to pay people for stuff online, so the less speculation as a way to get Rich the better.
Unless of course you are just here for the gainz and you think that because more people will be aware/buying bitcoin it will help your position.
