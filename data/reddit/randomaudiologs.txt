How long do you imagine that would need before it is able to work full time on understanding the stock market/cryptocurrency market? Also, how do you think that it would work out how to work the system?
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:10:21
How do you think that will affect the larger coins, if I may ask?
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:25:35
I was actually joking but really? How do those kinds of undercover systems work, if I may ask?
I see what you mean. So, it would affect some trading as there would be less trading between bitcoin and other coins? Or would people just try and skirt around that?
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:21:49
So, there would just be a lot more care and a lot fewer exchanges, simply so no one has to reveal that they have secretly had millions of dollars hidden away on their personal hard drive?

Well, I linked a company that was trying to actually give out its bot for the greater good because they simply wanted to take the learning curve out of the cryptocurrency game as they personally simply wanted to help people get into Cryptocurrency and be able to invest in it properly.

The company that I linked is actually trying to do that; their data collection captures social media and press releases for market analysis indicators and predictions.
I imagine if they would be able to do it, that Google DeepBlue would be able to do it as well because that is really what could happen in the real world. 
I like your idea though. It should be noted that; in 2013, the Associated Press's twitter was hacked and tweeted out that two explosions at the White House had injured the then-president, Barack Obama. However, before they could rush to retract it, the stock market dropped by one percent. In four minutes, the stock market dropped quite far. So, monitoring social media and news reports isn't a bad idea.

Live in denial that the bill won't pass or live in denial that everything is going to be just fine?

I may have had a bad example given to me personally but this is the one I am [talking]( about.
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:38:30
Well, CryptoCurrency was founded on the idea that we were all going to buy drugs and dance around as we shot illegal guns into the air. Why pay taxes when you can have more fun doing that instead?
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:37:12
Yeah, I have to admit, that does sound like it is a lot easier to track than around 365 transactions and all the hopes and prayers you have had to make. Well, I hope you don't personally get tripped up, my friend.
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:35:41
I wish it did. That would be pretty cool personally.

You can have Tesco brand vodka (which smells like paint thinner) and that's all you are getting. :P

Why would I be shilling for a tax bill when my language makes my point of view against it negative?
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:40:02
That is... well, I am not going to say I like it but I am going to say that at least they are trying to catch people who are trying to dodge out on giving their fair share at least. 
Aye. I imagine there is going to be a lot more non-US exchanges that are going to strangely hold onto your coins for all of the tax seasons when that bill passes.

If you were to perfect a system like this, it wouldn't have any flaws but that is like saying "if the boat was perfect, it wouldn't sink". You would have to keep fixing it and hoping for the best.
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:12:51
Well, they may not want it but what is to stop the average civilian from trying their damn best to try and get its wings off the ground? I don't see bankers running around, smashing up computers because people wonder if they could simply use a bot instead of a banker.
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:20:17
Oh, I apologize. I didn't know that this was an altcoin issue. I thought it was going to affect bitcoin as well. 
You know how there are undercover cops that try to catch people selling drugs? Prepare for undercover wallet addresses or narc wallet addresses and I had no idea where I was trying to go with this joke but anyway. I am going to say that I personally agree that this doesn't seem like much of an issue... unless you are shipping off millions upon millions of units of these things.
I hope you're not-worrying pays off ten-fold, sir.

Well, that's deep mind, isn't it? Deep Mind does everything from health care to energy efficiency to the water to the- hell, there is probably no real limit to what Deep Mind would be trying to do if we let it go for a few years on its lonesome but there is really something to the idea that we could easily have a civilian trying their best to make it.
I mean, hell, it doesn't to be as complex or intelligent as Deep Mind because Deep Mind is just that, Deep Mind. Deep Mind is a needed intelligence that is probably going to be used in every single kind of place you can imagine, from schools to hospitals to Google to probably Facebook. I imagine a much smaller bot would be able to be done for a fraction of the cost.
Hell, [this company]( here only really asked for half a million, which is a hell of a lot less than half a billion. If we can fund fifty-grand potato salad, I imagine we could fund something like this.

I really don't have any idea. The tax bill seems to be confused and not really focused. I think it is like when the British parliament tried to ban encryption and really had no idea what they were trying to talk about.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:04:22
I believe there is a place for AI within the cryptocurrency world and especially the Bitcoin world as it would be able to do things that the human mind simply wouldn't be able to do or the human body I should say. Using a combination of different optimized systems that can share those learning algorithms and
capabilities, you would be able to have an AI that could plan like a human but work like a bot and that is clearly the best of both worlds.

You weren't very good at copying my post �� you had to edit your own name out.
I hope this gets some more attention. I would love to talk about this more.
