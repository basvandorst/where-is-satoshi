Just got mine, and like the convenience of spending. I keep larger amounts coin in an offline wallet and only move spending amounts to coinbase as needed - there is no need to trust Coinbase with all your funds. 
I was concerned about the push vs pull at first, but I can set the max spending limit a day via the coinbase api, protected by 2-factor, so even in the event of a breach, the loss is manageable - and maybe reversable. 
It will be interesting to see how refunds/chargebacks are handled. I imagine the refunds are processed at market rates at the time of the refund?

This articles explains how bitcoin needs to scale. Also mentions we are no where close to the 7 t/s limit current, not even 1 t/s. The limit is artificial and the main crux is making sure minors don't mine artificially large blocks to 'annoy people'. In fact I think it's in miners best interest to mine smaller blocks as I understand it.

This, because a bitpay invoice expires after an hour. I use bitpay for a poker related service. Most customers pay by withdrawing from a poker site to my bit pay invoice. The problem is that the bitpay 'invoice expires' while waiting for payment, because poker sites process withdrawals slowly. When the poker site eventually makes the transaction I still get the btc, but the callback method to my backedend from bitpay fails, and my automated fulfillment never happens. So I have to process manually. I wish bitpay had a setting for 'invoice never expires'. Not sure what the security ramifications are but it would help in my case.

Just be careful when u try to spend these coins. I found the whole change address stuff can be confusing to users not familiar with how bitcoin transactions work. I've found the electrum wallet to be best with cold storage and making offline transactions.

Same here. Anytime I learn a new aspect of bitcoin, I really have no one to discuss and appreciate it with. The most common reaction, if I bring it up at all is what a risky 'investment' it is, akin to gambling. Talking about the payment/signature/decentralized part gets a glazed look.

Agree with everything except that this brings in new investors. I think it scares new ones away. Veteran bitcoin investors will know this peice is a steal and will scoop it up if they have funds. But new investors won't be around for some time I think.

I think we will see a new pattern where the price holds steady in a channel between 525 and 375 for 4-6 more months. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 13:34:12
I agree, but would add it would probably stabilize the price. Merchants who immediately convert to fiat will create more liquidity in the exchange and stabilize the price of btc.
It's my opinion that bitcoin's value increases when coins stay within the bitcoin economy, or off exchange transactions, because bitcoin is extremely efficient and cost effective at moving value between people.
@_date: 2014-03-20 14:24:52
Time is a flat circle. Sure, we can find correlation in any graph, but I laid our last 6 month runup with the previous 6 month runup, and the languishing pattern is consistent. For whatever that is worth from a guy who just got into bitcoin so he could play poker.

'The need for a payment history' ... Say hello to my little friend the block chain.  'It's best to build a credit history' within the existing financial structure - agreed. What I want to know is what's the best history to build in the new structure? Or is simply signing a message with and address I own simply going to be enough?

Wouldn't purchases be available via the blockchain? Just upload all your public wallet addresses and mash the date stamp with historical trade data... should be sufficient to show fair market value at the time if the purchase (and income if you are a business)

I can only answer for myself, but in the summer of 2013 I bought 10btc ($1000 a the time) worth of ASIC miners. I did the math and figured it to be slightly profitable. Back then the math didn't factor in the exponential increase in the network hash rate. It was more of a set increase month over month. I want to say diff was 18 mill or something. Within 3 months of mining it was clear it would not be profitable. I sold my miners on eBay around August/sept. The whole venture was about a $300 loss for me. I was happy with that, even though if I had hodled I would have an extra 5k right now. Looking at difficulty charts right now makes me chuckle, the point where I started mining in indistinguishable from the bottom line of the chart. Mining is insane these days.
Tl;dr you can't predict future. I made mining decisions based on available data. Btc exchange rate was 'steady' at time. Both price and mining diff went exponential after I started.

This was taken at my booth and  you're right about the calculator. I plan on incorporating suggestions in this thread (make it simple!). Thanks! 
That being said, it's very rare to be paid in btc. And it's a real eye opener hearing what the mainstream public thinks of bitcoin, if they have even heard of it. This was at an outdoor craft show, typical comments are... mind numbing. I do my best to explain.
The good part is, I usually have one person who is genuinely interested in it and I get to demo the wallet on my phone, send a transaction to myself etc. When they understand the transaction goes straight to each other like cash and no middle parties, they get it, and it's pretty cool.

I still play on there, it's pure bitcoin... btc in btc out. Cash outs happen in less than 12 hours, usually within 2 hours.

A node will hog all the wifi bandwidth. I had a nose running on wifi. The minute i opened up port 8333 to accept more connections, my family started complaining the Internet was slow.

I'm going to try a ELI5 for this... I hope I understand it correctly as well. 
Johnny and Sally set up a payment channel between themselves (think of it as they both escrow some bitcoins). The initial transaction(s) are "on-chain" and verified on the bitcoin blockchain. The initial transactions also have timelocks, so that if the inputs aren't spent in a certain amount of time, the inputs go back to the two parties to addresses they control.
Once the initial transaction takes place, Johnny and Sally can exchange signed transactions between themselves (off chain). They create the transaction as if it were real, and they sign it and everything with thier keys, but they only send the signed transaction to each other - the transactions are not broadcast to the network at this point. That being said, since they are signed, either Johnny or Sally can broadcast them at anytime prior to the timelock expiring. This allows them to continually modify the outputs of the initial anchor transaction as often as they want. 
Eventually, either a signed "settlement" transaction gets broadcast to the bitcoin network - or the "timelocked" refund transaction. This final transaction is on chain and verified on the bitcoin blockchain. 
How'd I do?

Always a big fan of Electrum! 
Question... I only use electrum for cold storage on an offline computer. Do I need to upgrade that software? Or can I only upgrade my online/computer wallet and still sign offline transactions with the older wallet software?

They only need to comply with AML when exchanging btc for fiat. Sending btc to btc is not a money exchange... It's like a merchant and a merchant isn't classified as a money transmitter by FinCen.

[ughh on mobile accidentally hit submit] 
... It was an email from Coinbase, she had to sign up with an account with them before being able to get the refund - which she then had to transfer back to her bread wallet. 
Unfortunately she signed up with Coinbase on a computer, do you know what a pain it is  to transfer coin from computer to phone? Either type in the address or email yourself your receiving address. 
Yes she could have installed the Coinbase wallet to transfer it, but a return should go back to the wallet it came from. You shouldn't have to sign up for a whole new acct and wallet to get your money back.

It's a pure BTC site - different than how PS will implement it. PS will likely exchange your BTC for your native currency and play on tables denominated in your currency. When you play on SwC, there is no exchange, all tables are denominated in BTC.

Some may argue that poker is gambling (or not), but I feel it definitely is worth it to play poker with bitcoin. Easy, fast cash outs. Sooo much better than the current sites that you have to wait 30 days to get a cash out.  
Oh, and since you aren't playing against the house, you just have to beat the rake.

This. You can send/buy/sell bitcoin via SMS text messages on Coinbase and Kipochi. Cell phone adoption in a lot of the world (even third world) is huge. Many individuals who don't even have a bank account can obtain a simple cell phone with text messaging, not to mention mobile banking is more common place in developing nations than the rest of the world.
