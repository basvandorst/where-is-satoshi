I understand your explanation, but LTC already exists.  Is side chaining just a value-add for BTC that aims to *replace* other coins?  
Other than attracting the base that favors LTC and getting them to work with side-chained BTC instead of LTC proper, can you really say that this tech would "replace" anything?
edit: bonus question: are you saying that you can "craft" LTC that is legit on the existing LTC blockchain?

This might be the best thing to ever happen to me.

Oh sure.  I have to agree, name recognition is name recognition.  It's a shame about the connotation but connotations can fade over time
I still believe crypto is the future

Case in point:  Fedoracoin, with the symbol TIPS.

I'm not sure what your goal is, but if you could not make the BTC people hate us any more that would be super

"To the moon" is a tongue in cheek rallying cry, at least for me.  I certainly don't mean to be poking at BTC, which made it all possible.

To be fair, its been around a lot longer.  What's more, the most prominent stories of that media attention have built mind share but not confidence.

What if I wanted some penises?

I'm new to cryptos, Doge in particular, and I just want to say that this thread has made me understand that you're not just some faceless, soulless corp.  I'll be doing some exchanging and it's thanks to this post.

Please enjoy this thread, I *just* read it last night so I'm glad I could put my useless knowledge to work.  Thanks @_date: 2014-04-02 19:34:40
Well look at the first guy.  You can't trust him.  I mean, that's a snazzy mask but he's bald-faced.  I wouldn't laser-money that guy.

I don't think anybody said that it wasn't...
