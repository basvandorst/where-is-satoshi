No. The answer is no. It only speaks to the amateurishness of the people in this market in that they worry about every single price fluctuation. You don't see people in the investing subreddits posting price updates every ten minutes for their favorite stocks. You also see intelligible discussion over there instead of people saying, "HOLD YOUR NUTS!" when bitcoin moves.

Is it really necessary to make a post every single time bitcoin hits a round number?

First-time investors who for some reason thought bitcoin was a good first venture think the earth is shattering every day because they've finally been taught the meaning of volatility. Carry on.

I did indeed see it. Large trades move the market. Groundbreaking. Tell me more.

If only market rules were as applicable as they are to other markets! The market is full of helpless noobs because bitcoin is like the craft beer of currency.

Volatility is still volatility regardless of the percentage. Would saying "SUPER volatility" settle you?

So, I lost.

I didn't say indicators aren't useful. I said it's not good to make posts every time the price moves. Things like, "Watch the crash live!" only create panic in the market and don't facilitate reasonable discussion.

Congrats, now we know trades are being executed in a financial market otherwise filled with amateurs. Ground-breaking news. Astonishing. Tell me more.

No one asked for your opinion on a comment that was not intended for you in any way. Move along.

Excellent analysis! You'd be surprised - some users there take *months* to figure that out.

I provided no opinion on BTC. Move along.
