Yes it certainly can, however there are potential issues that can come with raising the block size such as the blockchain becoming uncontrollably large meaning only very expensive nodes can broadcast it. Some people are instead in favour of trying to find "layer 2" solutions which can perform transactions without putting them on the main chain.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:16:00
Sorry, my bad
@_date: 2017-08-18 11:59:55

And this is still completely trustless?
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:16:15
There is something else to consider however. Let's say bitcoin cash goes to it's old hashrate, that'll mean 1 hour blocks, and being stuck with 1 hour blocks for three months until the next difficulty adjustment at that rate. Three months is quite a long time for a three week old coin
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:33:29
This is a bit misleading, 90% of hashpower is still signalling NYA support
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:35:02
You can also make a transaction with a lower fee now, and it'll just get put into the blockchain at a later time after those who are using higher fees. What wallet are you using to send the coins?

However, in past times where hashing power was lower, block times were still 10 minutes, because the difficulty was also lower. The last few days were difficult because mining dropped 50% but difficulty did not adjust, meaning 20 minute blocks
@_date: 2017-08-16 01:53:01
Wouldn't someone with SMS access likely also have access to 2G, thus not needing to use the Blockstream satellite in the first place?
Not trying to diss this, this is super cool. Just don't know how well it fits in with the satellites.
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:36:12
Yes, but if we saw block size increased by 800%, there would not be enough transactions to fill blocks, so fees would be very low and overall miners would make less.
@_date: 2017-08-16 21:56:36
Yeah, so at worst the security is reduced to the security of reusing passwords across different platforms. 
However, most hacking is done through credential stuffing (password stolen from one website used on other websites) and not physically stealing passwords from people's PCs, so it's safer.
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:48:29
This is wrong for two reasons:
1) almost all transactions are currently non-SegWit and so do not benefit from the additional block space
2) Bitcoin is mining at 60% of difficulty right now due to miners mining Bitcoin Cash, so capacity is almost halved right now
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:46:11

BCH has already lost half of its hashpower on ViaBTC, don't assume it still has 45% ;)

Not the case. When blocks aren't full, there is no fee market. You can use a 10 sat/b fee and it will be included in the next block even if everyone else is paying 100 sat/b.

Tldr; 45% of funds were siezed, everyone will be given back 55% (in a variety of crypto) and then receive tokens covering the other 45% of their funds which can be exchanged at a later date.,


Update5! Important! 08/09/2017
Exit from the current situation with the arrested Fiat:
1. Last 14 days we were engaged in struggle for your means, it was possible to gain control over 55% of funds (depends on the course), the remaining 45% are arrested funds, the most part in fiat. As the arrest is withdrawn from the accounts, the amount will decrease.
2. What is the way out of the current situation we see:
2.1. Work under the current BTC-e brand is not possible due to unresolved issues from the Office of Financial Crimes of the US Treasury.
2.2. At the moment, we are negotiating with a group of investors (an investment company), about buying and prompt launch of the service and repaying debts to customers. Further, the process of repayment of debt obligations will be described in more detail.
2.3. After we transfer all balance sheets of the investment company, we will recalculate the balance sheets.
2.4. The conversion procedure, taking into account the available 55% of funds:
2.4.1. All liabilities for fiat (USD, EUR, RUR) will be transferred to BTE tokens (1 BTE is 1 USD) at the exchange rate on the date of conversion. Probably, for more operative closing of promissory notes, ICO will be held on BTE tokens.
2.4.2. If you have on the balance the amount in koin, then you will be written off 45% of the balance of coins and credited with 45% of BTE (1 BTE is 1 USD). At the exchange rate on the day of conversion.
2.4.3. If you have a balance in BTE, then you will be credited with 45% in koin (the amount will be divided into 7 different coins equally BTC, LTC, NMC, NVC, PPC, ETH, DSH) and write off the amount of 45% in BTE.
2.4.4. Upon all recalculations, all users will have the opportunity to withdraw 55% of their funds from the system.
2.5. The investment company works in compliance with KYC, AML and the licenses required for this activity, so all users will need to undergo verification.
2.6. Tentative start dates end of August.
3. All debt obligations will be closed primarily from operating income from the investment company's commission, as well as from the funds we plan to sue from those who illegally arrested them.
The closing of the debt will be based on the principle of buying BTE tokens from the market.
The next update will provide more details on the procedure for accessing information on your balance sheet and when these funds can be withdrawn.
From the BTC-e team we officially inform that all the funds that were in the reserve fund (including all our income) were transferred to pay off the debts.
P.S. A warning! The cases of posting fake links on allegedly our new domain have become more frequent. All official information about our service is placed only in our twitter and from our official account on the forum.
Sincerely, BTC-e team

Okay, I got bip39 tool setup. But I'm not sure how to get the seed from Electrum in a form that I can use in the tool. Straight up putting Electrum's seed as the mnemonic doesn't work (I guess Electrum uses a weird format) and as far as I can see there's no way to extract the xprv from Electrum :( I'll keep looking
EDIT: I was able to figure it out!
In Electrum, `getmasterprivate()` returns the xprv which I was able to put in bip39 tool with the derivation path `m39/1/&lt;n&gt;` to get all the keys of my change addresses.
Thanks for the pointer, I sent the donation to the EFF.

Next block given a rational miner.
I also have never paid above a dollar a tx, but sometimes I need to spend some BTC urgently and having to wait 5 days is a big PITA.
When the tx rate is permanently above capacity instead of oscillating like it is now (just on the border of reaching capacity) then the fees won't go back down every few weeks. Hopefully we'll have some solutions by then
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:05:18
It's much safer than coinbase because you own your own bitcoins, instead of on coinbase looking after your coins for you (where they can do what they want).
It's safer than electrum because with electrum, a virus could steal your private keys (they need to be loaded into memory when signing transactions, and there's nothing stopping a virus from taking your keys then and then taking all your bitcoins)
Ledger/trezor are more secure in this regard because your keys never touch your computer, so no matter how compromised your pc is, your coins are still safe (unless a USB exploit was found in trezor/ledger which would be insanely hard to pull off). The way they work is that the pc sends the hardware wallet an unsigned transaction, the wallet uses the private key to sign the transaction  and then sends back the signed transaction, so your computer never sees your keys and they cannot be stolen.
If they released compromised signed firmware as well as a compromised application, then it may be possible to steal your keys as you describe (I'm not sure). But this still puts it miles ahead of the other options in terms of security. There's nothing stopping the same happening with electrum.
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:10:02
The next block fee hasn't been like this for months, only certain points in the months.
During the BCH antics last week, you needed to pay &gt;1000sat/byte for a next block confirmation. But that's cleared up for now. A 10sat/byte fee tx made 11 days ago would only have just confirmed now (if it wasn't dropped from the mempool first)
We should have both cheap and fast. Luckily both are possible right now.

Japan just has high trading volume because of their zero-fee exchanges
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:43:43
If you're shorting BTC on these exchanges, and the price increases to the point where you don't have enough cash in your 'margin' to buy the bitcoin back and return it to the lender, then the exchange will "margin call" you. This means it automatically buys btc at the current market price and returns it to the lender - ensuring that the lender gets their btc back, although you end up with no money.
This can lead to a situation where one short gets margin called (which increases the price as it buys bitcoin), leading to more shorts getting margin called due to the price increase - essentially causing a price increase avalanche. That may have happened here.
@_date: 2018-04-25 18:38:43

So if lock-in occurs, miners will switch to also signal bit 1?
@_date: 2017-07-17 20:09:24
I actually agree with you on that point - however I dislike other aspect's of ABC's design - for example Bitmain's 2 day premine which I think is repulsive
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:23:54
Yep, but the chance is small anyway. If BIP91 activates, I would say we would probably see 90% of hashrate switch (to avoid being orphaned), which would leave 10% probability of non-BIP91 getting the first block.
Of course, it's a serious issue if that does occur. Thankfully the fix/workaround just involves the miners being connected to each other for the first few blocks to ensure BIP141-enforcing gets the longest chain. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:14:06
Thanks, but when I asked coin.dance hadn't added it yet
@_date: 2017-07-17 15:48:05
Why are so many people signalling BIP91 without signalling SegWit? (Wouldn't this cause the miners to fork off?)
@_date: 2017-07-22 09:51:11
It's not really free because it requires you to freeze your BTC, requiring BCC to unfreeze it
@_date: 2017-07-17 15:49:05
People not running around screaming on r/bitcoin mainly - there will be a lot of discussion about it if BIP148 goes through
@_date: 2017-07-15 22:53:34

@_date: 2017-07-17 14:38:09
Where are you getting these stats?
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:02:54
From my understanding, if the BIP91 chain is longer than the non-BIP91 chain at any point this will not occur. I.e. if the first block mined after activation is BIP91 it will be the longest chain and related by all the standard nodes.
@_date: 2017-07-17 20:10:14
Could you elaborate? I don't disagree, but I haven't seen anyone explain this point yet (i.e. what makes it unsecure?)
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:46:57
No, because right now if you buy 1 BTC you are really buying 1 BTC + 1 BCC. So when the split occurs, the price of BTC should decrease by the value of 1 BCC 
EDIT: actually maybe I misunderstood your post and we're actually agreeing with each other?
@_date: 2017-07-23 00:33:22

@_date: 2017-07-17 16:48:08
Why are you with ABC?
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:46:57
If you want BCC from your BTC, **withdraw BTC** into a wallet you control before the split. Then you get BCC. I never said anything about trading BCC
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:04:26
That won't continue. On august the 1st it'll definitely have a big shakeup, but who knows where the price will end up
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:49:35


Wouldn't this require the SegWit hashrate to go below 50% to create a fork? 80% -&gt; 50% is quite a big difference
@_date: 2017-07-24 09:39:17
Just enter on August 1st after BCC launches
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:17:42
Could you elaborate?
@_date: 2017-07-26 23:21:24
If you have the private key it allows you to put it in any wallet, so you're safe. Even if your wallet won't support it there's nothing stopping you from switching to another wallet which does when a fork happens
@_date: 2017-07-24 20:07:34
If you want BCC, withdraw it from coinbase before August 1st

Officially, the pools that agreed to NYA are supposed to start on the 21st. However, nothing stops them from starting to signal earlier using the beta code (which is already released)

That's the key of what you just said. With extremely low liquidity market cap can be misleading. If I create a scamcoin with a billion tokens and then sell one to my cousin for $10, I technically have  market cap, but this can be misleading.
While that's the case, of course it will cause some damage to the price of BTC. Right now if you buy 1 "BTC", you actually obtain 1 BTC plus 1 BCC. On august the first, 1 "BTC" will only give you 1 BTC, so logic follows that the price of 1 BCC will be subtracted from the price of BTC when the fork occurs.

Note that was the solo CKPool:  as per the coinbase text

I'll believe it when I see it

Where does the 14 come from?
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:51:44
Yeah, I was surprised by this (I thought my initial interpretation of a split only on Segwit2x fail was wrong)  
@_date: 2017-07-23 00:32:40
I feel the same way as OP. I've never heard the arguments from the other side, only shit flinging and ad hominem from each side to the other.   
@_date: 2017-07-23 07:03:01
Yes. The same person was doing this yesterday too

BTCC is taken by an exchange: 
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:46:36
Yeah, I have also been out of the loop for a couple years. From what I have heard though, SegWit reduces the size of transactions 4x. Why not combine the two methods - i.e. have a 4MB block size as well as SegWit, allowing for 16x more transactions?
@_date: 2017-07-24 21:05:47
Estimatefee also seems to give wrong estimates :(
@_date: 2017-07-22 17:39:00
Yes, you are right
@_date: 2018-12-21 11:25:39
How does proof of keys work? Surely an exchange with a fractional reserve could just not participate?
@_date: 2017-07-24 19:57:15
High risk for sellers -&gt; Low seller supply  
Low risk for buyers -&gt; High buyer demand
Therefore the price is high

In incognito, it's mainly just based on country

If you buy on August 1st, you don't get any BCC, only BTC. If you buy now, you get both - I don't follow your logic
@_date: 2017-06-13 20:54:26
I think the point is that the price drop continues even after you have finished selling, and the price rise continues even after you have finished buying (due to other people following the market momentum). This means that your average sell price may be higher than your average buy price, giving you an overall profit.
I've tried my best to explain it here: 
@_date: 2017-06-07 15:42:39
Do you have an adblocker on your phone? That was the cause for me
@_date: 2017-06-17 13:00:28
What do people dislike about SegWit2x? I don't know much about it and I haven't heard any arguments against it
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:10:55
Some wish it was for coffee
@_date: 2017-06-19 13:38:52
Mempool just shows the number of pending transactions though, not the fees involved
@_date: 2017-06-14 12:33:48
Can anyone give me a serious answer to this: Why do people oppose BIP148? I've read the blog post and it just seems to say "it will do bad things" without giving an explanation I can understand. Sure, it might not be a very long-term solution, but I don't see the immediate issue people have
@_date: 2017-06-03 20:42:26
I'm pretty sure you can select a local port, and that local port gets forwarded to a random external port on their servers. The entire point of their servers is that multiple people are on the same IP address (anonymity), therefore it would be impossible to provide people with the ports they want because of multiple people wanting to forward the same port.

I was referring to consensus in this sub specifically
@_date: 2017-07-24 09:42:58
Each address can have more than 1 txo, hence number of txos &gt; number of addresses. Also, I think number of addresses only counts addresses which currently have bitcoin in them, not all addresses that have ever had bitcoin in them
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:22:08
Is there anywhere I can read neutral discussion? might as well be @_date: 2017-06-13 17:00:36


Pretty sure that's actually 4,000 satoshis, or 40 'bits'.
@_date: 2017-06-23 22:18:07
I didn't want my comment to come across as against Segwit2x, which it might have sounded like. I don't think I know enough about them to form an opinion on them myself.
@_date: 2017-06-15 10:56:42
Do we have an estimate of how much hashrate bitmain has?
@_date: 2017-06-23 18:54:12
Serious question from a bystander: why is everyone here suddenly supporting Segwit2x? Just a week or two ago it felt like the consensus was strongly supporting BIP148 and strongly opposing Segwit2x
@_date: 2017-06-05 18:40:07
What is Bitcoin for, in your view? For investors? For miners? What is it useful for?
@_date: 2017-06-23 22:22:42
Thanks for the explanation, that makes sense.
@_date: 2017-06-05 19:07:12
But worse than fiat if you can't use it for the sort of transactions fiat are used for, such as coffee
@_date: 2018-12-24 14:58:00
Not in 2013, when things cost multiple bitcoins
@_date: 2017-06-13 17:05:12
The reason it works is that it causes other people to automatically stop loss at a certain price, or causes other people to sell during the panic, trying to get out before it drops lower. This means the price drops even lower than just the effect of the dump, allowing them to buy in at lower than their average sale
@_date: 2017-06-05 19:40:53
Except that some people want to use bitcoin not just for investment, but also as a currency
@_date: 2017-07-24 06:18:22
It's already supported on Viabtc for fiat
