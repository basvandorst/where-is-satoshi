I got paid 100% in bitcoin for almost a year starting in the middle of 2014. Sold it all to pay rent and bills. You're all welcome.

The decision has been made already. It's no. Just like the Winklevoss application they won't confirm until the law forces them to.

"It may as well be gold" - What?
The only reason this guy is still in Bitcoin is because earn.com (previously 21.co) had $110m invested in it. Coinbase had the same investors, they paid themselves the $110m back by having coinbase buy earn.com... even though it was a failed startup. That moment would have made a bunch of early earn.com employees rich too - ugh.

Maybe they have so much money that a lamborghini has the same impact on their budget as a used toyota - effectively zero impact. When that is the case, you just buy what seems cool at the time and don't worry if that's a lambo or a lego set.

Yep, a use-case of Bitcoin that taps another market is useful. The 'not your keys' crowd are only one target market for Bitcoin and need to accept that others will do what they want with bitcoin - those of us capable of securing our own keys are a tiny group.

I know people that made hundreds of millions or tens of millions. Early adopters and people that started crypto hedge funds have done pretty well.

In the current system this is attempted via sanctions, freezing assets, money laundering rules, etc. It doesn't work. There's no reason to think it would work, or even be desirable, with Bitcoin.

If you think a Bitcoin ETF is getting approved this time around, I have some bad news for you. Decision has already been made. It's no.

Really, where will you buy the BTC to put in your wallet? That's the part they're solving for, making it easy to acquire BTC.

1 - From a customer pov in your fidelity account this will look just like buying and selling stock or mutual funds in your portfolio. 2 - you won't be able to withdraw the BTC, that's the custody part. 3 - they'll use a third party for storage and acquisition of BTC (like circle or coinbase etc)

Agreed. Brian's not wrong, he's just an asshole.

I'm surprised people think this. Mining doesn't live or die by the price alone. They have VC funding, hedged investments, business plans... It's not like they are run by high-schoolers.

My experience differs. But as per the explanations in this thread citing 'govt money bad, Bitcoin good' that doesn't solve a problem anyone over 60 has. Bitcoin unfortunately doesn't solve the fed. If you want to convince people it's a good idea, start with something Bitcoin could be amazing at even if the fed didn't exist.

Did you even watch the video? Wall Street is setting themselves up as middlemen for important trading infrastructure. They don't need to make a new Bitcoin, they will just take a slice of this one every time you touch or move it.

Like most businesses, miners are funded either by debt or venture capital. Nobody runs a business the way you describe it.
