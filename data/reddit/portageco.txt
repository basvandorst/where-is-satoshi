Have to get rid of that Fiat cash somehow

It is one of the vendors within the App.  The store personnel had no clue they accepted it.  Gets processed as a gift card in their system. The teller just scans a barcode on the phone.

Call it whatever you like.  I transferred BTC to my SPEDN wallet that holds it as BTC (price fluctuates as BTC price changes) with no transaction fees.  Of course the merchant will have a mechanism to get it back to USD, they’re not bitcoin speculators they are running a coffee shop.

Couldn’t help trying it out.  I’m a sucker for coffee and breakfast.  HODL the rest.

Apple App Store SPEDN by flexa.  Took a while for them to register my account to add funds but works now

I’m not able to send invite codes...that I can tell.  It took several weeks for them to activate my account once I signed up.

 Nope, it was the SPEDN app.  Do some research, it processes as a gift card.

The store personnel had no clue they accepted BTC.  It processes as a gift card in their system when they scan the code from the SPEDN app.
