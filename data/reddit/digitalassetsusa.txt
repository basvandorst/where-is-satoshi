Hey thieflar,
Thank you for the feedback! We'll make some adjustments to add clarity.


This is true. While we have accounting partners who worked under the interpretation that because cryptocurrency is treated as property for federal tax purposes, then U.S. Code § 1031 *previously applied*, this cannot be confirmed without specific guidance from the IRS. -- **As always, trust your accountant(s).**


So far, our team has been pleasantly surprised by the feedback from Congress. They generally seem happy to work with us as we've been told we're the only group approaching them with the intention of protecting cryptocurrency consumer interests.


Also true. You only pay capital gains on what's considered profit. We'll clarify that.


While cryptocurrency provides incredible benefits outside of facilitating payment, we do specifically believe there's a great deal of monetary value in cryptocurrency that has the direct potential of benefiting the economy. Though "market cap" is the most direct, albeit imprecise, metric of quantifying this (to our knowledge), we'll work on being clearer.
Thanks again!

In the US, if you want your business to work with USD to transmit/convert payments, you have to a registered money transmitter in every state your customers are in. Coinbase is one of very few, and so they have a pretty strong hold on the market.

This is pretty cool. Are you tracking historical data at all? Comparing daily sentiment averages with trading averages could be insightful.

This is just the start :)

Heads up: Looks like this was proven to be fake.

Close though. They're only missing an "o".

It's powerful to see nations take cryptocurrency this seriously. Akin to the space race we had a couple of decades ago, I think we're seeing the start of the crypto chase.

Recently I've had a significant increase in the amount of incorrect password attempts across multiple exchanges. I wonder if they're related.

You can actually. Some states' registrations are more lenient than others, but most share the similarities of being expensive and slow. Another thing to note is you still have to be registered on the federal level through FinCEN as a Money Services Business and follow Know Your Customer as well as Anti-Money Laundering regulations. -- As always, consult through your legal counsel.

Also looks like it's always been sad :(

Now that's a great conversation starter. I love seeing Bitcoin signs out in public.

This video makes me miss the past but also makes me really optimistic about the future.

It's a good sign that major financial institutions are opening up to cryptocurrency.
