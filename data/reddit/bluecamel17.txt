Everyone's making this more complicated than it needs to be.  It's not so difficult to build a CMS with solid auth and dole out permissions from there.  Or even simpler, only allow deploys from git, and only allow trusted people to commit to master.

So is mine :/

I just got a Trezor, and now I'm paranoid that I wrote the seed down wrong, even though I checked it multiple times.  Or the fact that I don't understand how the seed recovery works (if I can lose my device and still recover the wallet, what does that mean?  Is my wallet really stored with them and I'm trusting them to get things right, similar to an exchange?).  But that's obviously because I just haven't learned enough about how it works yet to feel confident that I'm doing the right things.

Well, duh doy.  Even if you get your fancy HSM working on a web server, the person(s) controlling the network, DNS, CA, etc. could subvert it in different ways.  There's always some level of control at the system level, and there are multiple systems involved.
@_date: 2016-08-19 17:12:13
Cool, thanks for that!
@_date: 2016-08-28 07:18:38
Thanks, I didn't realize others could do that.  Looking at the nano s, it's pretty sweet.  I was considering getting another Trezor as a backup (and to learn and test), but now I'm thinking of grabbing one of those.  If I understand what I'm reading, both Trezor and Ledger use BIP39 for the mnemonic, meaning one device could be used to recover the loss of the other.

Thanks for explaining!

I'm not talking about stock WordPress, but it sounds like that's all you're thinking of.

Related, how do you guys deal with the delay to purchase?  I bought my first BTC a couple of weeks ago.  The purchase finally went through on the day of the Bitfinex hack, so I got substantially less than the value when I made the purchase.  I understand why it takes so long, and I'm in it for the long haul and not worried, but I don't understand how other people are dealing with that.  It just seems really risky to buy, not knowing what's going to happen several days later, and not having any control if things change in between.
@_date: 2016-08-19 05:46:40
That doesn't invalidate the point, since they got access to his private key(s).
@_date: 2016-08-19 05:43:35
Why are you so optimistic?  And why BTC, specifically?

Maybe my parents, but someone who's buying a hardware cryptocurrency wallet?
@_date: 2016-08-28 06:43:19
Thanks, I was looking at that.  There's also some code in one of the trezor repos for testing the seed.  Maybe I'm being super paranoid, but once I've typed the seed in, I feel like I've reduced the security.  Unless I had an airlocked computer, which I don't, but this may be my motivation to set one up.
@_date: 2016-08-17 22:14:08
I have to admit, I think half of my motivation to learn more about bitcoin and ethereum is fueled by the weird drama, so I can better understand what they're doing.  It's so weird and interesting and also exciting, because everyone's still figuring out (or at least arguing about) how these sorts of things should function.

Shit just got way too serious on Reddit about Wikipedia.  If you kids don't calm down, I swear to Google I'll turn this internet around!

I like how you do pessimism ;)
@_date: 2016-08-19 05:27:58
I've looked at the site and read all your replies here and I still have no idea what you're proposing.  Are you wanting to create a platform like Mechanical Turk that pays workers in BTC?  The site says something about how it's to "discover Bitcoin".  WTF does that mean?
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:06:17

That's true.  I was just objecting to someone paying for thoughts or opinions.  It's how you end up with douchebags like Geraldo.

That's because it's not even remotely a justice system.  Even if it were, justice is a ridiculous standard.  Regardless, it's a vengeance and profit system.

Nobody is doing the bipolar thing except for you.  Expressing concern about something is not the same as giving up on all of it.  Geez.

It's traditional startup thinking.  Hire a pretty face to push your product.  Most people don't know the difference and buy the shiny new thing.  For Dash, it's kind of sad, because it suggests less legitimacy than I think they deserve.

Basically, if the user input isn't one of two things, the logic is that the program will abort.  So, it's "trusting" that the input is valid in order to keep running.  Good code would make sure that even invalid input wouldn't kill the whole show.

As far as I can tell, you're bringing no substance to this conversation and are just being a contentious dick.  Thus the downvotes.

I'm with you, buddy.  I also think it seems uncharacteristic of him.  It might be, but it would be nice to know.  Regardless, it's completely reasonable to ask for validation when someone posts a Twitter DM attributed to anyone, much less a huge voice in cryptocurrency.  FFS, people, a Twitter DM.  Give a kid with even mediocre Photoshop skills a few minutes and they can send you an image of any Twitter handle saying whatever you want.

Wouldn't this set precedent, though?  If a couple of more cases also rule that bitcoin is money, wouldn't it be hard for another to rule otherwise?

Not if you also use PayPal.  They've updated their terms to disallow this type of thing.

I'm curious, why did you choose to build your own smart contract system instead of using something like the Ethereum platform?
