But what price is "Low"?

So on a laptop mining is a bad idea. To little airflow and prolonged mining will cause damage. There are these fun little hacked together things called eGPU's that you can build which consists of an open air external graphics card. I kinda want to build one and run it with my laptop and see how it works. I think this or a dedicated open air rig is your only option.

Some windows systems support ram disks also. Think it would work there too?

You remove all plastic shrouds and heatsink components and get down to the PCB itself and put it in the oven. You realistically can do it in your home oven but they have precision temp controlled ovens that do this too.

The whole part about simplifying refunds for accidental payments is cool.

Some people on Bitcoin-OTC are willing to take them, I've also done some trades with people on the Bitcoin forums for paysafe cards. People are happy to accept them just got to find someone interested. I would avoid the exchanges and go with a person-to-person trade.

They were talking about it on the bitcointalk.org forum. Someone said that with the update to the btccharts.com site caused all the btc to usd prices from MtGox were inflated 1$ by mistake. It was an error.
@_date: 2012-12-17 22:05:09
No it expired like 2 days ago. There is a bitcointalk thread as well. I'm sure whoever manages the site is working on renewing the cert.

He's talking about his name yes. The last bit of his username are "firstbits" which correspond to a set of bitcoin addresses. You can look them up in a block explorer like blockchain.info.

Yeah I would have thought so. Just wondering if Linux had some other difference in how it wrote the file that made it different in another regard.
@_date: 2012-07-18 18:04:16
I like this idea. It should happen.

Additionally transfers take a while but this is because they use ACH transfers and at the moment this is really out of their control. You can expect to usually receive your coins 3 days or so after purchasing. Made a 100$ purchase there the other day and it was very easy.

They likely are trying but the supply is rapidly shrinking it seems. There has been huge demand recently if you haven't noticed.

Not exactly. So more people mining means more distribution of network power. Bitcoins are generated at a somewhat constant rate as determined by difficulty and such. The more miners there are the more difficulty goes up so the less profitable it is for each individual to mine, but it also makes it less profitable for one huge individual. That is what we want, lots of people making it more difficult for one entity to control a major portion of total hashing power. So with ASIC's power consumption is so small that any old person could do it "for fun" and make a little money and not spend a bunch on electricity.

Technically there hasn't been an official release yet. I mean they probably just finished putting together all the payment backend stuff. So with time I'm sure they will begin promoting it some more.
@_date: 2013-03-14 16:56:37
They could be from the automated fudging system. Or just people pouting.
@_date: 2013-03-06 17:28:18
Yeah I think applying an retroactive transaction fee might be a good idea. But the canceling part sorta is counter to the whole non reversible idea.

Yeah Coinbase is slowly picking up their customer service game. Right now I think it's still just the two of them, but I believe they are planning on hiring a somewhat decent sized customer service staff in the next few months.
@_date: 2013-01-24 23:35:23
That's not the point. It's about distributed network strength.
@_date: 2013-01-25 20:35:40
I would go with a pool and let it sit on your desk hashing away. Supporting the network and generating a few bitcents a day. You could make a few bitcoins a year like that. Not sure how many but a couple I would think.

No the transactions included in a block don't have bearing on the difficulty of solving the block. The two are unrelated. There is a page in the wiki that explains the problem that is being "solved" when a block is found. It addresses what factors in to the difficulty of solving a block.

Woot! Know who my new registrar is, at least for new domains till it's time for a renew. Maybe I'll even transfer my existing ones.
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:35:34
yeah well lots of people have been warned. so they know what they might loose. and others know what they might gain. so you know, what happens, happens.
@_date: 2013-02-21 05:40:51
Coinbase is still in what seems to be a development phase, but this is true of many ycombinator projects. But one thing they do right is customer service because they seem to understand that when your product isnt perfect, you are responsible for it. I've been very impressed with them thus far.
@_date: 2013-03-06 17:38:52
I understand but that's not exactly how coinbase works, they don't just buy all their coins off Mt.Gox. Demand is still very high though and they are having trouble keeping up. 
@_date: 2013-01-11 14:39:49
They buy from a bunch and conglomerate their price from multiple places. 
@_date: 2013-02-01 00:26:30
I agree but they will say what they want and there isn't much we can do to stop it.
@_date: 2013-03-25 14:43:27
Yes, because avalon doesnt do fab. They buy from a manufacture in the idustrial area of China they are in and do assembly at their facility. I do believe Avalon's owner does have a partial ownership or something in the fab plant though as well.
@_date: 2013-03-20 16:20:03
Seconded. When my renewal comes up its bitcoin time.
