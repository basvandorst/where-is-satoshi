And here I was thinking you were making fun of me for having a dollar.
It's true

Well one 'optimistic' scenario would be that the guy wanted to sell his bitcoin, but to not crash the market, the exchange gave him the usd amount in tether, basically exchanging the coins without them ever being "official" on the exchange, so the market isn't affected.
But it's pure speculation.. and what the point of the remaining 700 million would be i have no idea.

Because the China trade deal will impact most industries while in blockchain it doesn't say anything since they're making their own. Comparison's shit
@_date: 2019-11-11 11:00:37
The Bitcoin Cash forks still have value though, so comparison's not accurate.

We're still in the downward trend that started in the summer. Until we break that this is still bear and going down towards 5k.

Oh pump and dump groups in crypto are unheard of.
@_date: 2019-11-25 17:58:13
Yes, by "groups" i mean groups of people or entities, not chatrooms specifically. And besides, they've already brought us the 2017 megamanipulation and everything thereafter.

Check out if there are any ATM's around you. Otherwise Kraken

From what I've gathered, it will go up. That being said, it might go down, or sideways.
Glad to help

Zimbabwe wants to know your location

Estonia most realistically. They have a young government with e-citizenship and coin already.

This is the kind of information I pay to get. The first one is subjective and highly relative, as that 'slightly down' could still count as such even if it goes down 80%, and it is backed by literally no data or precedent.
The second statement is 3rd grade math. If 50 billion dollars are injected into my daughter's flower stand, it will rise far more than gold percentage wise as my daughter's flower stand is a tiny market compared to gold.

8.3k -&gt; 8.4k OBVIOUSLY 
Better than the S&amp;P
@_date: 2019-10-12 14:58:23
But not impossible, also I would call it unlikely rather than *very* unlikely. If btc drops below 8k soon we might see that.
@_date: 2019-10-15 22:35:24
Never tell me the odds
@_date: 2019-10-26 19:35:34
10.8k to 9k barely anything
@_date: 2019-10-26 19:37:15
Oh please "the amount of interest in BTC has been seriously underestimated", who do you think is driving this? This is market manipulation pure and simple, barely any new people in crypto as it is. Whale/ETF wars is what it is
@_date: 2019-10-27 00:18:03
This is good for Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-10-27 23:07:57
I see you are a man of culture as well
@_date: 2019-10-24 10:18:24
There's no way it'll go tits up lower than $69
@_date: 2019-10-30 02:45:00
God forbid people start asking themselves what the current priced is based on realistically. \*shudders\*

What's the difference between the two other than convention? If btc was at 4k with double the supply you'd have a full btc. Would that make you happier even though you had just as much cash and potential growth?
@_date: 2019-12-18 02:31:07
There's actually a good chance it just bottomed out. 6.6k was the bottom called by most of my TA friends, although nothing is certain. I wish you good luck!
@_date: 2019-12-10 09:57:58
half that in the air somewhere as well. Just wait and enjoy the market manipulation!
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:44:10
If I have 50% of the company, no matter how much the other shareholders trade their shares I will still retain my 50%.
If they have enough market share to do this now, they'll have the same market share at 100k - probably more actually since the whales can accumulate way more easily.
@_date: 2019-09-25 10:58:36
if a small group pumps/crashes btc like this, then what is this market?
@_date: 2019-09-25 08:46:45
Research is crap when the market is this manipulated. Get used to it, everybody calls bullruns and alt-seasons every week or so. If you believe in it, invest in it for the long term, and if not, don't.
