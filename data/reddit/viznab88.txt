Letting house money ride as if that's less of a risk is a trader's fallacy though.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:05:41
I'm up 140% since this time last year and didn't lose a dime in this dump. Your turn.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:13:56
I assure you, the vast majority of people who bought pre-2013 looooooooong sold their coins since.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:29:38
People laughed in my face when I told them to take profits during the bull run. Karma is fun.
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:12:23
'Back then' Bitcoin actually still worked as a currency and wasn't plagued by insane fees and confirmation times. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:02:34
I am very very much in the green since I actually heed my own advice and take profits when the price has risen considerably. But thanks for your concern.
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:13:05
Sure, any mental gymnastics to make you feel better about how gravely in the red you are will do, right?
@_date: 2018-01-26 14:29:22
- People taking profits  
- People avoiding losses  
- People shorting
- People needing usable fiat for daily use  
- People who don't believe in bitcoin  
- People who have too many bitcoin and want to rebalance  
- People who are not utterly brainwashed into a HODL-OR-YOU-FUCKING-DIE mentality  
Need i go on?

You make it out to be a good analogy and the conclusion you draw is flat-out wrong. It is not relevant to the situation, **at all**.
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:59:22
Derivatives by definition do not 'flow industrial sized money' into bitcoin. Not a single bitcoin will be bought or sold when someone opens a futures contract. You're purposely spreading misinformation.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:29:04
As said in the other subreddit, your analogy is garbage since the child is **guaranteed** a second marshmallow while you're not guaranteed another 20k price increase by any means.
In essence it's still a gamble, find me some research where gamblers are the most successful people in life pls.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:28:28
Go all in then, go on.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:21:37
It does. You don't need physical bitcoins to offer a futures sale. You'll never have to 'go get them' to settle your contract. The 'supply and demand' argument is completely moot. There's theoretically infinite supply of futures contracts - someone can short for &gt;21 million bitcoins worth if they wanted.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:38:37
Have you calculated what the total bitcoin value will be if it continues this exponential trend for 3 more years?
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:27:08
Get fucking rekt bitch :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:03:22


So there hasn't actually been any adoption of Bitcoin as a currency, is what you're saying then?
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:53:58
I have taken those into account. State obligations as well.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:11:47
If you want to actively create a movement that actively allocates effort to working against bitcoin, this kind of bullying is a surefire way to do so. That's OP's point.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:07:48
Exponential growth for the next 3 years continuing the current means Bitcoin in total will be valued at thousands of times "all the money in the world".
I don't even need my bullshit detector for this.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:59:33
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:43:59
Your PC is basically chuck full of it. Just because you're uneducated about the matter doesn't mean gold has no practical properties.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:52:22
I stopped investing in bitcoin once it became clear it wasn't going to work as intended. That was about a year ago. Though what made you think I stopped trading this thing into oblivion? Lots of money to be made on mania, you know..
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:01:10
Wait. Wasn't the whole pitch talk for bitcoin "buy regular old things everywhere instantly with lower fees than current payment processors" for years?
Now the network has gone to shit, this suddenly changed into "oh yeah this is actually fine who the fuck needs to buy daily shit with bitcoin".
So bitcoin failed as a currency then? Is a commodity after all?
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:27:15
No. It's a sidebet on bitcoin price. All contracts are settled in cash. Bet wrong with an underwater long or short? You pay the difference in cash. Never will a contract end up with actual BTC being bought.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:52:15
You're talking bullshit and are just narrating your book. Bitcoin has always been about 'replacing fiat'. It simply turned out incapable.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:18:22
Shh. Don't educate them on something they don't want to hear. I much rather see the disbelief in their posts when they come back to reddit complaining how the events that happened where "total bullshit" and why they "didn't understand this earlier".
Can't wait, tbh.
@_date: 2017-02-17 10:34:17
Go all in right now.
@_date: 2017-02-17 10:06:29


Lol what a load of crock. They sure as hell didn't do that when they were leading 100$, but now that they're trailing 20$, OH NOES!
@_date: 2017-02-09 16:44:15
Made the wrong trade there, buddy? Buy and hodl, right?
@_date: 2017-02-09 15:10:13
Also means your bitcoin are losing value. That's harsh man.
@_date: 2017-02-09 14:12:30


If you already don't understand how this works, you shouldn't be in bitcoin. The exchanged ARE supply and demand.
@_date: 2017-02-09 15:01:22
So you're saying exactly what I'm saying but worded it like you disagreed with me. Now I'm confused.
Step 3 is prohibited, yes. That's what I was saying. So Chinese will be way less inclined to buy BTC because they can't transfer it to another exchange.
@_date: 2017-02-08 01:26:30
@_date: 2017-02-08 01:49:16
@_date: 2017-02-09 13:23:56
Most delusional thing I read all day. "Oh they can only withdraw Yuan. Guess they will just hold their BTC" Where is the logic in that? What do you think when people want to get their money out?
Historically, what happened when other exchanges halted BTC withdrawals? Do you remember Mt.Gox? You think nobody will be scared? :) 
@_date: 2017-02-16 22:38:07
That's some shit math, cause transferring a million by wire transfer doesn't cost all that much either, and you'd get a similar number of "weight moved in gold"
@_date: 2017-02-09 16:50:03
So why are you so mad when your coins are in cold storage anyway?
@_date: 2017-02-09 15:46:43
They literally blocked exactly that for at least 1 month. I mean, are you dense?
@_date: 2017-02-08 10:26:55
The time to file claims in the Mt.Gox bankruptcy have long gone afaik. Doubt there's any grounds for her to retrieve them.
@_date: 2017-02-17 12:51:39
I was being sarcastic lol
@_date: 2017-02-17 10:33:07
You're bullshitting yourself and here's your downvote back :)
@_date: 2017-02-09 13:44:03
You've got your logic twisted. **They can't get their BTC out**. There's no 'transferring abroad', BTC are stuck there. There's no converting to USD.
They ban BTC withdrawals, not yuan withdrawals.
@_date: 2017-02-11 16:44:08
One logical explanation would be that the company/entity that's putting massive amounts of hashing power on the board currently, is not backing segwit. As his non-supportive market share in hashing power grows, the signaling percentage will drop.
@_date: 2017-02-04 02:19:25
Is it not down 9.75% then?
@_date: 2017-02-09 14:24:48
Because China is a cancer to BTC that needs to be chemo'd hard. And PBOC seems to do that now - once chemo is finished and Chinese traders are no longer invested in Bitcoin and/or using it to transfer Yuan out of the country, BTC will behave much more normal.
@_date: 2017-01-26 01:38:31
Yeah don't act like all western exchanges weren't blindly following whatever arbitrary chart China drew because they could pull off fraudulently backing them with millions of artificially bloated volume.
@_date: 2017-01-11 17:15:32
Wager me 50btc that it won't within the next 48 hours? :)
@_date: 2017-01-11 17:17:53
Whatever you do have then?
@_date: 2017-01-07 03:04:11
You're obviously new to bitcoin. This has happened every single time bitcoin bubbled. Major exchanges 'drop the ball' in prime time, because that is profitable.
@_date: 2017-01-25 08:52:39
Ding ding ding we have a winner! 
@_date: 2017-01-19 15:24:23
So where is this magical money coming from then? What's stopping that sketchy site to just keep my BTC and who says you're not a shill?
@_date: 2017-01-07 11:16:24
Not really. It's not something you or I can change.
@_date: 2016-12-23 22:38:00
Delusion my friend. "Not this time" didn't apply for the bubble, nor will it apply for all the FUD that comes with it. China will ban bitcoin again.
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:12:22
I am a 'formercoiner' but never bought back at or close to ath. I stopped buying anything for long-term past 3k since I don't think it's legit. Downvote me, do whatever makes you feel safe, **but in the meantime I still more than tripled my total net worth over the last two months alone** by day-trading all the FUD, crashes, bounces that this lovely volatile asset and their shit-variants have. Without shorting even, since my platform (bitstamp) does not support margin and I'll never send a penny to Bitfinex or Kraken.
I will not buy back above 3k, so maybe even never, but I'll be damn sure to keep making significant profits by gaming the collective panic or exubrance.
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:39:43
Aight mate :)
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:30:09
My money doesn't care about whatever subreddit you link, fucking pleb. Get on my level. Yes, i have the money where the mouth is, feels good, smartass.
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:43:36
In the end it doesn't matter. Money = money, so get shit bro :)
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:39:24
Yet people hate me anyway. Oh, the toxic bitcoin community. Just in case; fuck you too.
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:35:00
I'm reacting to the guy that said "They'll buy back at 30k".
You can be both a day-trader and x-coiner, you know.. I'll never be back to hold coins unless it drops low enough.
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:55:45
You're living in a fucking mirage if you even think that's a remote possibility. Fucking idiot.
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:26:53
Oh I've held cold coins long-term before, so definitely an ex-coiner. It gave me my starting capital with which I now day-trade.
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:38:44
Think whatever you want bro. In the meantime, thanks for your money.
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:35:47
I know, but on an online messageboard it doesn't really matter, so better safe than sorry. When you come here with sane arguments on why people should sell when the price is high, you get shit on as well. So I've defaulted to being an asshole on here, for sure rofl. Let the dumb money burn.
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:40:38
In the end it doesn't matter. Money = money, so get shit bro :)
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:29:53
It always bounces, and usually with ~10% within 10 minutes.
