They'll be fine, since zero point nothing percent of people use Bitcoin. You can always sideload apps anyway.

Not conforming to your preference of decimal mark and thousands separator makes one illiterate? Are these numbers' values not unambiguous to you, you who are so numerate?

Yes. Currently have some old electronics for sale at friendly prices, bought a few things there myself. Buying is a great experience, although it's mostly pretty weird/shitty stuff. Some enterprising people have a whole line of doge products (which is pretty shibe if you ask me).

Agree on the annoying UI limitations. Watch out for fees when withdrawing CAD e.g. with paypal, Quadriga doesn't list it. Kraken is a much better exchange except for the CAD aspect.
I wish Bitsquare was more popular (read: had any CAD liquidity). Many Canadians will have free interac e-transfers, so the fees are just the 0.0005/0.001 BTC maker/taker.

If you didn't make a copy of your wallet ID you'll have to ask whoever owns the email address to send you the wallet ID. They shouldn't be able to reset your password, though.
Alternatively, You could try emailing blockchain.info's support people. The wallet ID is stored in a database alongside the email you used. It'd probably be best to explain your situation, otherwise it might look like you're trying to hack the email owner.

OpenBazaar + TOR = Silk Road to Valhalla. It's still a thing because it's decentralized and work on the software is ongoing.
