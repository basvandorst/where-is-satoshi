Ppl are talking about "major dip" when market opens on Monday, Dec 10.

By the time you reach Switzerland and setup an account, BTC will already cross 12.5k usd. Don't consider these little profits, see the bigger game. The currency gap will only be considerable if BTC is trading at low price in Switzerland than where you are living right now. For instance, BTC is trading at 12.9k usd in India right now whereas its only around 10.6k (right now) in majority of countries.
Its all supply and demand.

They did give me my Bitcoin Cash though.

Forked coin = bitcoin gold.
Bot was redirecting my post to other sub, so i didn't use "BTG" in my post.
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:00:07
Wow. So much of free money for the exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:32:53
At binance i can also directly transfer to ether. But thing is high fees to send on coinbase initially.
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:29:14
You piece of shite.
Stupid bot.
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:30:53
Try "Bitcoin Checker" on play store if you are Android user.
You can pin notification on notification bar its clean simple and has almost all exchanges listed.

I finally transferred. Ended up paying 0.0004 BTC. That was set by default. Got 2 confirmations in less than 10 mins.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:06:07
Sad part is, my local exchange only supports btc. No way to get some ether. :(
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:37:56
Do you expect a price spike after CME's official announcement today? Or that spike already occurred 3 weeks back when CME initially announced BTC futures? Your views?
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:06:11
If you can buy immediately than you might consider the Switzerland option(do check at what price are local exchanges trading in Switzerland) if gap is significant, then buy from there, or else start with USD and get on the roller coaster before it reaches a new ATH. Still a lot of uphill climb left before year end.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:37:20
NO NO NO NO
You don't get it.
Its not about currency, its about demand in Switzerland.
Suppose I am in India, 
1 USD = 66 INR indian rupee
So if demand in India is equal to USA
And suppose BTC = 1 dollar
Then in India it will cost me 66 INR
But right now demand in India is so much that worldwide price is 10.5k USD but in India its 12.8k USD (829,000 INR)
Its all about demand and price at local exchange.
Nothing else gonna make the difference whether you buy with Dinar, Dollar, Pound or what ever currency.

Gotta admire that determination!
I am always lured for a day trade!
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:56:45
Wish I was Satoshi Nakamoto.
Or wait, maybe I am.
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:36:45
I ama just a basic investor, no huge amount, well below 600 usd (but thats all btc i had)
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:15:18
Before the end of this year?
I am missing the rollercoaster ride that's going on right now. ��
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:34:53
Just dont wanna end up being called that "guy who sold at low and bought back at high"
It lures me a lot to buy back tho
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:03:49
Ok so here's the thing
I am Indian.
Right now the buy rate at my exchange (Zebpay) is 1600 usd more than the rate I bought at.
That's too much.
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:13:59
But the rise to 10k was too much and too fast.
Instead of correction it increased by 2k usd overnight. :(
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:19:40
I know that might not be true.
We live in a crazy world.
But all I need right now is ppl saying me that it will fall back to 9k.
Helps me
Thanks mate.
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:32:34
Yeah thats the only thing I am scared about.
Once it crossed the 10k mark, every fuckin news/ blog on social media who don't know a thing about BTC are posting about it.
So more and more investments going on right now by newbies.
