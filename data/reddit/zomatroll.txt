tbh LTC is actually one of the few decent cryptocurrencies out there.

We are so far away from that point. A lot of the technology is still being figured out and is currently bleeding edge, but yes you bring up some good questions. No one knows yet how stability will be brought to a decentralized system, but there are many projects in the work.

There are a bunch of btc/altcoin merchant services out there. Some include:
*

Google something along the lines of "merchant bitcoin payments"

Coinbase. It lingered in around 10,020 for me for at least a hour, but not on any other major exchange where it was around 9,950.

Sold at 11300, bought back at 8800 all in a hour. I was sweating at work.

You have some companies now that pay smokers less due to this. I forgot what company started doing this and where, but the article highlighted how much time an employer loses on employees smoking cigarettes each year and the numbers were astounding!

Yeh no shit because their job is not the care or know about Bitcoin... The ECB will take care of that, not individual European governments. They can't do shit really when it comes to this and they don't! Why would you when it is bringing all this innovation and money into the country.

This is pretty sad :( I wish you and your family the best of condolences. If it makes you feel a bit better, I think your brothers actions where the result of something deeper (eg: depression/bipolar/OCD?), but it was the Bitcoins that triggered it? Thousands of people, including myself, made the same mistakes your brother has made and I still sometimes want to kick myself when I think of it laying in bed... At one point I had 100 BTC that I purchased for $9 each and I sold them all for around $50 and never looked back at BTC until last summer. Of course I regret it and sometimes I wonder too what would of happened if I kept it, but to be honest, no one would know. They could of gotten lost, hacked or I would of probably sold them at $2000. Anyway... I'm not sure what my point is, other than like you stated "1 mistake doesn't define you future". Again I'm truly sorry for your loss; what an awful story :(

Dude it's not a national newspaper -_-.  "landelijk dagblad" = a tabloit that is available nation wide. It's an opinion piece written by a economist who writes for a private tabloid owned by a Belgium family. This has nothing to do with the government. It does not even include any statements from the ECB or Dutch government and its entire premise is based on that blog post that claims its a bubble. It's a shitty ass article, with an even worse title. I think you're misleading most of the community here with this title man.

Welcome to the club! 6 weeks without buying a single pack of cigarettes here - only smoked maybe up to five ^ . ^ Next goal is to fully stop the weed too, another easy 150EUR :)
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:16:56
This is a Belgium tabloid and just a fucking opinion piece by an economist. The title is completely false lmfao.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:15:15
Uh sorry but let gets some facts straight:
* This is **not a Dutch national newspaper**. In fact, it's [owned by a private Belgium family media company](
* AD is a tabloid paper 
* This is an opinion piece by an economist who has little experience in the field of infonomic nor international finance risk management.
* The article is based on[ an analysis]( created by an financial risk broker for the firm Ritholtz Wealth Management in NYC posted on **his personal blog**
* This article simply highlights the problems that could occur, which are very real, if Bitcoin does crash and does not recover from a bubble. They are valid threats and possibilities that should always be taken into account when dealing with funds and investments.
* The Dutch government has not said anything regarding this subject, but in general is neutral and supports and funds innovation in fintech and regtech.

lmfao this is going to be such a shitcoin. Anyone who thinks a government that can't even run their own country can develop a successful cryptocurrency is delusional.

Inexperienced traders, Coinbase/GADX, lack of understanding of underlying technology, whales and bots are probably all factors.
