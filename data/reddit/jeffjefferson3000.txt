You can buy and store the bitcoin all in one place. Imagine buying bitcoin from your online bank account and keeping it right there. You don't need a ledger or a cold wallet. Your funds are secured and insured up to 100k euro

In Germany you can sell them tax free if you hold it longer than a year 
@_date: 2015-06-23 17:09:02
I doubt they check it at all. But you could provide them with the address where you have been storing your btc for longer a year. And in the blockchain is the proof that you just moved them now after over a year.

Hi aus ludwigsburg 
@_date: 2018-05-04 07:40:00
besides it's on top of the welfare money poor people are receiving anyways in germany. the more they collect the more they get. it's also taxfree
@_date: 2014-08-07 19:39:16
ID selfie is totally unprofessional. There is something called PostIdent in Germany. Verification is okay but I'm not giving my ID card to someone on the internet. How many IDs are there in the Mtgox data dump? What is going to happen with them?
@_date: 2014-09-11 16:14:58
it's a different service. and Kraken are scared as hell of the german regulation. You have to provide a selfie with your ID only if you live in Germany. As if all Germans are freaking scammers.

@_date: 2014-10-19 19:13:26
the beta was working perfectly for a couple of months. as soon as the servers are running again it will be awesome.
million dollar transactions costing about 4 cent "fees"!
@_date: 2014-08-21 22:39:04
i just see the last 15 transactions. or am i missing something? where is the rest?
@_date: 2014-08-07 17:35:06
i was confused too and it took a while before i found this thread. it's really a joke. Germany a high risk country for fraud. Yeah, right. i won't use kraken anymore. there was i reason why i wanted to stay tier 2 and not 3. it's really a shame because i liked kraken for it flexibility and volume.
can someone recommend another exchange for trading with euros? a real exchage with instant buys/sells. bitcoin.de is great but it is too slow for real trading.
@_date: 2014-08-21 21:58:37
why is the transaction history incomplete? i want it ALL!

Thanks but that wasn't my question. I know that he just needs a wallet on his phone for that. I wanted to know what the current situation is for bitcoin users in Israel 
@_date: 2017-03-10 12:40:01
So he needs to register at one of the exchanges? I don't want to force him to do so in order to cash out the coins which I send him. Is local bitcoins allowed in Israel? Are there any buyers?

There are many super easy lightning Android wallets out there. No node required. Bitcoin lightning wallet, eclair wallet, blue wallet, wallet of Satoshi. Just try them! Also here is a little lightning tip for you!
!lntip 100
@_date: 2019-03-26 21:29:36
No you don't. 
@_date: 2019-03-26 14:27:23
Just use a lightning wallet like eclair or bluewallet ! It's actually same as paying with bitcoin only really faster.
!lntip 100
@_date: 2019-03-13 13:33:17
Wow, great news! 
@_date: 2017-01-23 14:31:48
Without a sick premium you can't. You can use a prepaid credit card. But the prices you pay are really higher than at bitcoin.de 
Give bitcoin.de a try. AFAIK you can buy smaller amounts without the need to send them a post ident. However you need to give them your real name 
Ofc you could use an atm in Switzerland or another neighbor country ��
@_date: 2019-03-11 04:51:00
I have an old note 1 lying around. Would love to be able two run a node on that one! Looking forward to your tutorial!

Used bitcoinde back in 2013 to buy my coins. Switched to kraken pretty soon. Kraken is better in every way possible. Better prices, better liquidity. Also you can deposit and withdraw directly to and from kraken using sepa. Your money is there next day or even on the same day.
Just use kraken
@_date: 2018-06-01 12:09:29
So is it possible to have more than 2 default routing servers? To minimize the risk of all of them going down. And is there a guide on how to make ones own routing server somewhere?
@_date: 2018-06-01 05:47:17
Here he explains what he has modified. Maybe you guys could somehow get in touch 
@_date: 2016-11-08 05:50:10
@_date: 2018-06-01 12:08:14
Ok thank you for the explanation! So is this also a reason why it isn't possible to receive ln payments with eclair right now or is it something completely different? 
@_date: 2018-06-01 00:56:35
So how come it is possible to receive lightning payments with this wallet? While eclair wallet doesn't allow that? 
@_date: 2018-06-04 10:50:18
I was using eclair wallet and had a channel open with hodlmonkey and was able to pay via lighting at bitrefill.
You can also try the bitcoin lighting wallet from Anton kumaigorodski from play store. You can even receive lightning payments with that one. Can definitely recommend that one 
@_date: 2018-06-01 10:28:56
So what's the negative aspect of having the routing on the external server like it is done within this app? 
@_date: 2019-10-23 13:56:11
Cme Futures expiring in 2 days. As usual price gets dumped couple of days before that.
@_date: 2019-10-23 13:52:40
What do you mean? It's a common pattern sadly. The theory is that big players buy otc large amounts of btc without moving the price and use the cme Futures to go short. Then they sell their btc and profit from their future shorts. There are lots of articles on that. Just Google bitcoin futures manipulation
@_date: 2018-06-03 06:42:01
Really beaut designs! Have you considered accepting lighting payments? Would really give you an extra exposure. I know I would definitely spend some btc via lighting to buy couple of shirts! 
@_date: 2019-10-23 13:55:24
Cme Futures expiring in 2 days
@_date: 2018-06-01 05:09:37
Yeah, tested it too. It's kinda complicated because you need two make place for receiving first. I sent some to the coin panic faucet. After that I was able to receive my lightning payment without any problems. I also took some out of the faucet. Btw great service providing that faucet.
All together i must say that this wallet works better than the eclair one. Will definitely stick with it. Maybe the developers could add a donate button somewhere. I'm sure lots of people would donate to developers today make some space within the lightning channeling in order to be able to receive lightning payments. 
Great job! This is definitely a huge leap of forward! 
@_date: 2018-06-01 06:34:58
Oh sorry if I got it wrong. I thought it was related. Great work nonetheless!

hopefully more sites will enable LN so I can spend my sweet btc on things!
@_date: 2017-05-11 06:58:58
Please buy a hardware wallet like Trezor or ledger nano s. It's really easy to use and it's safe. And there are not expensive. There are a lot of vids on YouTube how to use them. Never keep big amounts on an exchange

what do you mean lose? yes, it does cost a bit of fees to transact. xmr is kinda stable so you won't lose that much exchanging btc to xmr and back. but you have to pay some fees whether you exchange them on polo or via shapeshift/xmr.to
@_date: 2017-05-24 07:28:20
It seems you have made up your mind. Just do it. Besides I'm sure we'll see much lower prices soon

Get yourself a hardware device like Trezor or ledger. It's really user friendly and that way you can be safe. You also get a seed that way which you could store just like a paper wallet

U do know eth is traceable right? Best solution is in my opinion btc- xmr-btc via xmr.to 
@_date: 2017-05-26 08:37:21
Sorry I misunderstood. No,  at Polo you can trade for more than 2k usd without verification but you have a daily withdrawal limit of 2k. So to withdraw 10k usd you would need 5 days.

That's also my dream, bro. How have you been able to deposit bigger amounts? Bigger payments fail for me. Or do you have a channel opened directly to the tip bot?

They have a traditional crypto exchange with fiat pairs called Nagax.com
Also they have a full social trading platform like etoro which has been running for years. But you can use your cryptos to bet on stocks. Like bet your bnb that Apple stock will rise and get more bnb if it really rises. 
They even have a debit card you can use your cryptos with 
They also are integrating trading of gaming items in their ecosystem. So soon you will be able to trade the items you get within games for fiat and cryptos
Their coin is called ngc and is available on bittrex for example
