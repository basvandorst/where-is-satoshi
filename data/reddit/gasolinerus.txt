0.000129btc(around 0.80$) ? I'm quite surprised.. the lowest fee Electrum advise is 0.00149 (around 10$)
Your transaction will probably go though in 1 or 2 days if the backlog doesn't clear.
you are at the bottom of that graph
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:26:25
Yep, tough luck man. 100% your fault.
Take it as a lesson, and be thankfull it didn't happened with more than 130$
By the way, does anyone know if OP can sue Google for showing ads that point to phishing site ?

Reddit admin have enough information to know exactly what account is linked to what account. Hopefully when they investigate these vote manipulation they will find out that some of the key players in promoting bch is involved.
Finger cross!

satoshi / byte. it is the price you pay for every byte of a transation. If i recall atm the average size of a transaction is 226 bytes this means OP paid 37.166 * 226 = 8399.516 satoshis (0.00008400 btc)
OP transaction might have been more than 226 bytes because he says he paid 1.54usd which is around 0.00020 (20000 satoshis)

Last week I sold all my bch for ltc and btc (1bch were 0.4btc). I went on r/btc (because my post was censored on here)  and asked what was the best wallet to send out bch, among with the answers I got laughed at because I was selling the coin of the future

Yet Shapeshift still has a 20$ miner fee.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:10:58

Exchanges 
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:15:14
They can yes. Only reddit super admin know which account as upvoted or downvoted. They can also know if some account are linked to one an other. Usually when there is enough proof they ban the account 
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:21:27
Well if OP finds the money to pay a decent lawyer I can guarantee you 100% than this kind of scam is perfectly suited for a suit against google
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:15:42

@_date: 2017-10-27 16:28:26
Let's assume yes :p
