Financial reward is the lowest common denominator, and is thus the most broadly appealing of all the miscellaneous incentives that drive participation in the Bitcoin [experiment.](  
Were Bitcoin not to become accepted as a "money-like commodity"  it would lack the necessarily universal scope only by which it can be a useful measuring stick for valuation of all other values, and thus the entire motivation for making and maintaining a universal ledger would be deprived of axiomatic basis.

More and more of this argument is being crafted for VCs and other forms of professional money who are not as familiar with the nuances in these issues, but *are* under pressure to allocate funds as fast as possible to get the scoop on competitors, and whose regard for the allocation of said funds focuses on who seems to have the best team and exhibits strong leadership, not whose hair splitting argument is technically superior.

The payment is for a premium delivery service.  The cost of the content (whether it is $0.00 or some other amount) remains the same.   This is an interesting use case for digital currency because it plays to its advantages in many ways, and would be impractical to do with any other payment system. 
Bitcoin can only directly mediate the efficient allocation of resources that are able to be moved entirely within its domain, such as digital content, storage, bandwidth, memory, processing power.   Bittorrent, as a resource distribution model, checks all of these boxes. 
It's remarkable that it hasn't been tried already.

You only see a small cross section of what is done.  This is superficially an improvement on non-blockchain approaches, but it is certainly not transparent. 
Superficially because in some ways it is worse than other approaches with less visibility because of unsubstantiated confidence in the additional data, when this additional data is technically trivial and cost effective to carve into any shape desired through automation. 
Believing that the blockchain cannot be used to lie in greater and more convincing detail than previous systems, in order to more effectively misdirect the confidence of the market, is simply magical thinking.

A 10-minute consensus snapshot for the whole planet is not going to fit in a goddamn mempool of any single node, ever. Nor is the entire blockchain DB created by this blast of a million data firehoses going to fit on any storage media that individuals can afford to maintain. Moore's law/Nielsen's Law aren't answers to anything, they are educated projections based on observed trends made many years ago and are starting to unravel as non negotiable physical limits begin to make their presence felt (anyone who knows where I can buy a 16ghz general purpose CPU feel free to correct me here. Multi core per die is a concession to, not a defeat of, these limits). 
It seems plain that Bitcoin either has to compromise on full decentralization (and fall into a fee-chasing race to the bottom that will spiral it towards either no decentralization or the usual 2-horse race that these contests always become) in the form of allowing the creation of trusted subdomains of local autonomy (something like Bittorrent or one of those masternode-based altcoins, or sidechains), or else it has to compromise on being the world-conquering cash replacement that some wish to see it as, and accept a more limited role as a nifty bit of back end plumbing for other contract systems. Which is really just a rewording of "compromise on decentralization".

Agree so far


Why would they be debased?  What if the old coins were nullified and not replaced at all so that there are simply, say, 20% fewer coins altogether? Or every remaining non-nullified address coin gets a proportional split so that you end up with the same money supply but every remaining address holds 20% more? 
What if there was a very good reason to expect that the value of the coins you hold would go up considerably if you went along with a change to the money supply that had very favorable conditions attached to it?   Would you, a rational bitcoin holder, care what happens to a minority of old coins with no title claims on them, that are at best worthless to you, and at worst, pose a volatility risk to your investment? 


This would increase the economic utility of that chain, not decrease it.  Remember, the "debased" chain (which isn't debased) is the one the majority of people wants to use.  By spending on it you've now transferred what small influence you had on this majority-backed chain, to another party who (odds slightly favor) already is a member of the majority that backed switching to it in the first place.  You've undermined your own economic power.  Also, even if your clever plan had any actual teeth, the "other guys" can do the same to your chain, and there are more of them to do it. 
You are thinking like a Bitcoin holder of today, who cares about (and perhaps is unaware of how much you discount the service costs of) "bitcoin the ideology," not like one who just cares about whichever Bitcoin will get the most investment from the most people, even if the reason for the investment is "wrong" by today's Bitcoin ideological standards.   


This is the crux of your argument, really.  First, miners can't stop this. The "other guys"  can mine too, and if they want to underwrite their chain with mining support, they will - it's much easier to influence 51%  of all the hashpower on earth through forming your own bloc, than to fight it.  Second:  Long term, mining itself grows less and less relevant and will give way to a complex, multi tiered fee market anyway. In fact the new chain could dispense with PoW altogether as one of its selling points (yes I am aware this would mean it is no longer "Bitcoin", but again..  be aware of how much ideological, as opposed to economically rational bias you are being influenced by). 
Majorities will act in their own best interested, regardless of whether the current Satoshi/Voorhees/Szabo/Popescu/Matonis/Ver/etc bitcoin bilderbergers would be royally screwed by its decree.

I would hardly call the banning of a handful of hecklers from buttcoin (along with the usual crop of generic shitposters who pop up in every community everywhere) a victory, nor even an explanation of the changes in the tone of this sub.

"decentralized" has to be contextualized to be a useful term in these discussions. 
"decentralized trust root"  vs.  "decentralized transaction queue" have different implications, and that's just one case. 
In fact, decentralized and distributed are, at the extremes, antagonistic terms.   Strong decentralization (devolution of control or authority to end nodes from central ones)  means weak distribution (because you cannot specialize work to fit advantageous local circumstances, and modestly advantageous circumstances tend to snowball into significant ones once a race to the bottom spiral gets set in motion), and vice versa.

They don't have to answer you. They *can* use the network. 
Bitcoin is worth whatever someone who decides to acquire it is worth. Bitcoin can be used, abused, re-purposed, forked, for whatever motivations or reasons they like. 
Whether that is for helping the poor, or dealing drugs, revolutionizing banking, building Bitcoin up or tearing it down, or screwing earlier Bitcoin adopters over by stealing their movement from them and nullifying their coins, all is fair game.

How can this actually work? If the consensus is on smaller blocks, the big block is orphaned and the first spend discarded with it. Hostile miner thus wastes their attack. If the consensus is on larger 'BU' blocks then the big block is accepted and smaller one includes a tx that is recognized as a double spend and thus invalid. Hostile miner is forced to spend only once, and legitimately, in the first 'BU' big block.

I know what you are saying, but I don't think most people in this community would be satisfied if Bitcoin turned out to be an interesting technical showcase that has little or no economic viability because the mainstream finance world is far more interested in cost savings (which is what drives markets toward centralization) than in "decentralization."  
Satoshi likes decentralization, so do most of the early Bitcoiners. So do a majority of Bitcoiners today. The design of Bitcoin, naturally, aligns with the priorities of Satoshi as described in his whitepaper, and with that segment of the population who have priorities similar to Satoshi's. 
He/they have a bit of a blind spot to the cost premium that decentralized systems exact because they implicitly believe decentralization is "worth the price," but few others (as a percentage of the population) would agree. This is why adoption is stagnant. The pro-decentralization movement called Bitcoin has attracted about as many natural fans as it can, and newcomers have to be convinced of the ideology (in the absence of a speculative bubble) before they commit. 
Maybe their perspective can be changed, maybe they can persuaded to buy in to the importance of decentralization for the sake of a better world. Maybe not. This is the fundamental existential challenge for Bitcoin.

What's the "wow"?  This is trivially automated, would be optional anyway, and could be set to respond to a simple slider in the wallet indicating a user's tolerance for upping the ante (expressed as a percentage over current highest fee) in order to get a premium spot. Similar to how Priceline's name your own price feature works, or numerous eBay auto-bidding systems. The user wouldn't have to know what's going on minute to minute. 


I also don't see what the problem is with this if it is optional, there are plenty of use cases where the recipient might know more about the urgency of prompt confirmation than the sender does, and wish to pay more for faster service.
The only trouble I see in these ideas (and I haven't looked at the code, so maybe they don't have this problem) is the potential for abuse of the network by creating zero-cost backchannel noise with cascading storms of outbid fee notifications.  These should be made expensive somehow in order to defang such a DDOS attack.

Congrats on successfully missing the point in every single sentence.  Reading is hard!


Didn't say that, although now that you put it that way, it's something I would generally agree with nonetheless. The thing that runs like shit is the greed-driven incentive pump. Bitcoin's flexible ecosystem has many incentive 'fuels', of which greed is the crudest and least energetically efficient grade, the dumpster full of used french fry oil.  Its chief benefit is that, being co-morbid with stupidity, it is a nearly infinite resource. 


This isn't even an answer.  


You should be so lucky toots.  :D  Much worse than that. I like Bitcoin. What I don't like are cancerous ancap parasites incapable of understanding Bitcoin as anything more than a feeding trough.

@_date: 2015-06-21 00:56:21


The fundamental question of Bitcoin is approximately "do you think decentralization is worth the cost?"  Every other question precipitates out of this one. 
The waste you speak of is part of the cost of strong decentralization. People who support Bitcoin by investing in it (buying it, blogging about it, mining it, selling solutions based on it, etc.) either aren't fully aware of the cost and the implications of it for total utility, or are fully aware of it and think that it is a necessary expense to discourage fraud and subversion and to maintain a strongly decentralized network.

What you want is Bitcoin, the blockchain with a self-referential trust root.   Blockchains with external trust roots (whose security is derived in part through off-chain incentive/reward mechanisms for practical or cost vs. benefit reasons) are probably not going to be as interesting to a generalist pro-decentralization ideological standpoint. 
Some blockchains aren't trying to take over the entire world, but that doesn't mean they won't revolutionize specific parts of it. 
Bitcoin does not have to "own" the term "blockchain" to stay relevant, there is no need to defend this position unless your talk-up with your VC is contingent upon them believing that if they invest in "Bitcoinville" mental real estate with your company, they are getting some land over in "blockchainville" thrown in for free.

Sorry I was making a more general point about your comments, not specifically about the parent comment.  You maintain in a few places that you are referring to the capacity of the entire network, regardless of block size (which is a somewhat arbitrary sized capture frame of "now" to fit all Tx into the limits of a single node's RAM given assumptions about a single node's link speed).  
I think people are missing this nuance, that there may be no optimal combination of block size (and confirmation time) that will handle the volume of Tx that the network at even a 20-fold scale up from where it is now (still ridiculously inadequate for global cash replacement system), because the network is ultimately bound to the capabilities of a single PC/server, and that is never going to be sufficient to handle that volume.  
Bitcoin distributes the work of securing the blockchain, but doesn't distribute anything else. Not storage, not memory state, and it only distributes messaging in a very inefficient manner to serve the goal of 100% node cohesion with no local autonomy. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 00:02:09


This means he has no votes. The other BTC owners have no innate reason to preserve his interests over their own, where those interests conflict.  


This is a scenario where the new majority's interests conflict with the old majority, who is now the minority (assuming they aren't out of the game altogether due to how dead/jailed/MIA they are.)


I don't think we're talking about the same things yet. What actions 'rational behavior' actually manifest as, are entirely dependent on market at the time 'rational action' is being considered.  This is not about total active coins. It's about who has the numerical and political initiative to steer the protocol to suit their interests.  If you can't defend your stake, your interests are at risk of being subordinated to the interests of those who can.  The longer bitcoin lasts, the less the interests of the increasingly aging, anonymous, marginalized early adopters will matter.

The institutions you are referring to do a helluva lot more than just secure the fiat network.

You seem like an informed observer.  Can you explain how it is possible that Bitcoin will be able to absorb and record even 1/10th of the Tx/s that VISA handles and remain a fully decentralized model, where every full node stores exactly the same information, and there is no ~~parallelization~~ work distribution in any way whatsoever except for securing against sybil attacks and coin emission?  These latter two functions are significant accomplishments but by no means do they encompass the entire work domain. 
The entire 10-minute consensus front for the whole planet is not going to fit in the goddamn mempool of any single node. Nor is the entire blockchain DB created by this blast of a million data firehoses going to fit on any storage media that individuals can afford to maintain. Moore's law isn't the answer to everything, and it's just a figure of speech anyway.

Irrational doesn't mean "disagrees with your reasoning." Participation in a market isn't inherently rational.  Rational action is informed by context and the goals of the one who is taking the action. If you don't know what those goals are, you cannot gauge how rational the action is. It's not unreasonable to speculate that the objective of apparently irrational action is to change the context surrounding it until it becomes rational.  
They have their reasons, and the fact is, if we agree with those reasons or not they are able to do what they like.

Looking at both histories I don't agree that is a troll, unless by troll you mean a skeptic, and skepticism is one of the checks and balances of a healthy community just as much as support is. I'm pretty tolerant of smartassery so maybe his style doesn't read as trolly to me as it might to someone else. 
I was asking because it's not the first time I've seen someone imply that linking to a blog post for further explanation is bad form, as if it's some sort of etiquette no-no.  
I can see how someone could abuse this tactic but you'd have to go about it in a pretty blatant, redundant and "punch the money" lowbrow manner for it to be a real nuisance, which is not a pattern of spamming I have seen much of on Reddit (thankfully).

It definitely meets the criteria for being a brand, though as it lacks a defense against trademark erosion I'd say it is on the way to becoming a metonym for "decentralized money." 
It is easy and tempting for the newcomer to this space to confuse the cloud of (often irreconcilable and incompatible) abstract notions of decentralized money all trying to crowd under the umbrella term Bitcoin ("Bitcoin-the-meme") with the specific and far more limited complex of software, hardware, protocol and network that actually constitutes Bitcoin itself ("Bitcoin-the-thing"). This confusion tends to help sustain Bitcoin because of people's tendency to give the benefit of the doubt to things they find attractive from a distance, an attraction which compels them to draw closer to get a better look - and then.....

Whether it is gambling (or not) is kinda missing the point.   A lot of things that are "gambling" are not considered particularly scandalous.  
The point is that there's a moral hazard created when Alice can (behind a screen of anonymous, alternate or proxy identity) get rewarded by an unwitting Bob for correctly predicting X will happen, when in fact it was that same Alice (under a different identity) who was the cause of X happening, just as Alice "predicted".  Bob has no way to tell if Alice is predicting X, or causing X, or both.

How can a decentralized anything ever approach the speed expected of an exchange?  Unless someone develops faster than light communication, decentralization (strong bitcoin-style decentralization especially) has very high irreducible link costs, and this limitation cannot be overcome with on-chain approaches, ever.

The flaw is not this sub in particular, it is that Reddit rewards in-group bias via downvote censorship power, where you can visit the most punishment on opposing views, with the least effort.  If you downvote a dissenting post below -5, it becomes invisible, whereas even 5000 upvotes has no comparable benefit.  Once a post is hidden it's far less likely to get the attention needed to resurrect it.    Why take 10 minutes to refute in writing what you can take 1 click to censor? 
Again, this is not a problem limited to it's a major part of how Reddit works its social engineering user stickyness magic: It turns out people respond very well to the self-gratifying illusion of participating in an egalitarian forum with a spectrum of different views which also has this convenient one-click risk-free censorship button to punish the views they don't like. 
Eventually the frustrated dissenting group splinters and makes their own subreddit and another useless echo chamber is born.  In this scenario, no matter who "loses", Reddit wins.  
Its probably too late to remedy this using something like Slashdot's meta moderation system.

Depends on whether the network is supposed to do: 
A: replace cash and cash-regulating institutions altogether (strong decentralization, 100% redundant, no local autonomy, expensive, complete internal trust root means it needs to be adopted completely or will ultimately collapse, perhaps inflation exists for inevitable structural reasons and not just 'greed' after all), 
or B: augment cash to overcome cash's inherent implementation shortcomings. Will exhibit weak (a.k.a. partial)  decentralization / local autonomy models like DNS and bittorrent and email, is nicely cost-resource tradeoff flexible, is more immediately useful and thus "sellable," but will require spiralling complexity in the form of external trust scaffolding.
Bitcoin is quite literally made out of ideology.  But which one?

The fundamental pass/fail existential question for Bitcoin is whether "decentralized-ness" has some universal intrinsic benefit to anyone using a system that exhibits it. If so, the next question is whether this benefit outweighs the "decentralization premium" - the substantial overhead costs of doing "X, decentralized" vs plain vanilla "X".

The growth numbers from 2009 are very misleading when presented out of context (as they usually are).  
All business ventures, even dull and mundane ones, can post spectacular growth metrics even if they are only moderately successful -  especially if you start measuring from zero. Yet despite this, many ventures eventually return to zero for many reasons. 
When I was in high school I started a lawn mowing job in the summers to make a few extra bucks.  The start of my first summer I had one customer (a relative who loaned me their push mower and gave me $5 to fill it with gas and oil so I could use it on other jobs - in exchange for doing their lawn for free). So technically I had $5 in revenue that first week.   By the end of the first summer I had just over a dozen regular customers and bought my own used mower which was much more efficient than the jalopy I was borrowing.  After expenses I was making around $180 a week.  My revenue grew 3,600%. 
Three summers later I was working at this 'side' job almost full time, all year long, having bought a riding tractor and expanded into snowplowing in the winters.  I used my trailer to move pianos and other large things when I didn't have lawn work on tap.  My weekly average take, after expenses, had grown by this time to around $670, a further 370% above my $180 mark, and 13,400% over my first week.  
Yet somehow Forbes keeps forgetting to call me for an interview.
tl;dr   Measuring gains starting from any venture's pre-bootstrap period is lying with statistics.

There's no reason for them to use a blockchain. We in decentralville like blockchains because they accrue their store of trust from a consistent, well-attested process of algorithmically corralling millions of random interactions between thousands of unaffiliated users.  Trust is placed in the network to discourage mavericks from defection through a balance of incentive rewards.  
A body that derives its trust from a charter to govern that has been granted by the people being governed already has all the trust it needs, there's no reason for it to undermine that trust root by setting up an entirely separate trust root in the form of a blockchain. 
Doing so would either devalue the trust granted to them by political mandate (or, in the real world, whatever mandate they deem to be 'good enough' to be defensible), or would amount to just creating a central e-Dollar which would be just as 'mostly traceable' as a cryptocoin, without needing a blockchain and all the drawbacks that bitcoin-style blockchain-backed decentralization has in terms of complexity, cost and performance.

After the various and sundry multinational plaintiff's lawyers get their cut, and Gox's defending lawfirm gets its cut (win, lose, or settle they get paid), and whatever fines and fees are involved in keeping accounts open at MtGox for its banks in Japan, USA and Poland get paid, and after fiat losses are somehow made whole, I predict you will be lucky to see half of that percentage.  Even if Gox found every last satoshi out of the missing 650k, expect to see at minimum a 50% return offer due to the overhead costs involved in this mess.   
Especially the people suing are going to be goaded by their attorneys to press for a better deal than the rest of the unrepresented people are getting, which can drag out proceedings and costs even if no such deal can be struck.

HFT trading shops do not work in lock step nor are they out to steal from mom n pop main street investors. If they did, we'd all be raped by them non stop until the market ceased to be liquid altogether, which would probably take less than 10 minutes (disregarding settlement).  Rather, their platforms spend nearly all of their resources battling *each other* into a state of near equilibrium, with little net effect on the markets they operate within. Yes there was a race condition that led to a flash crash exactly once, but this was an accident that revealed a corner case which has since been addressed by those regulators you claim are doing nothing about HFT.  
FWIW, Bitcoin, with its pathetically slow transaction speeds and attendant scalability problems, is a non-starter for HFT (unless it is done from inside an exchange).

Exactly.  This is another excellent point that makes this theory improbable.  The only way this plan could work is if Gox customers transferred fresh BTC from their cold storage into their Gox accounts to sell (while that was still possible), and who in their right mind would do that when prices are 1/4 everywhere else? Yet I think  I heard this absurd theory a dozen times in the post Feb 7th slide and crash.  It's like how people always attribute large-scale trade behavior they don't understand to "stupid whales" or "hurr dur stupid bots buying/selling" as if anyone would leave a bot in control of $100k buy/sell orders.  
There is only 1 ways this scenario makes sense, and that is if the other exchanges were in on the plan.  Only this way could the friction present in the BTC-FIAT-BTC cycle be eliminated to the point that this could be done smoothly and without arousing any notice.

I don't have time to explain in detail at the moment, but you can get a sense of where I am going with this by reading this thread:
FYI:  Average unconfirmed transactions at this moment is 2150.  It has hit as high as 6000 (maybe more, that's just my own checking)
at 7 per second = 307 second delay, 5 minutes, for *one* confirmation.  This still has not been fixed and it is not a software issue alone or of course it would have been fixed already.

pretty much yup.  most of this this told you so shit is probably from latecomers who bought above $500 and are losing their mind over nearly being underwater here, and think if they pile on the anti-gox  bandwagon they kill monster and shove the rest of the skeletons back in the closet with it.  Gox had a lot of benefits as you list above plus a few more unique facets I have cited in other posts.  
But its so much easier to act like people wanted a $100 higher sell price and thus were greedy, when 2 seconds thought reveals how stupid this POV is, because if you are moving coin on to gox to sell it, then you are going to have to either buy it back at the same relative spread, gaining nothing, or else you aren't leaving coin on there at all because you are taking a one way ticket out via fiat, and should have no significant coin exposure at all.  There's no way that anyone left with significant coin on gox was doing it because of some special extra greed level vs other exchanges. The spread would have arbed away to nothing if that spread were ever exploitable at all.

Also, the db leak shows balances that are current up to the last day of public operation on Feb 28, but the transaction records stop after November 2013.  That means the hackers had access to current data up to the 28th of Feb 2014, but for some reason left out the transaction paper trail from Dec 1 2013 onwards.

I see this as clarifying that Bitcoin is not a currency in the long term, but a sort of generic abstract bartering unit - the first of many in what ultimately becomes a global bartering market where all commodities traded within it have a price that is denominated in other commodities, of which Bitcoin only one. 
Today we have Bitcoin markets.  A bitcoin is nothing more than a globally unique piece of a tradeable commodity with a floating value relative to other commodities with similar marketability (i.e. altcoins, fiat). It's a piece of unique, but otherwise useless data with a market-defined pricetag.   
Tomorrow (the figurative 'tomorrow'), all digital property has a floating market value.  Want to download a new song? It has a price, not against dollars, but against other songs in the market, or other versions of the same song, i.e. a FLAC encoded remastered version of Pink Floyd's "Money" is worth 2 copies of a 128kbps MP3 version of the same song.  If you have no songs to trade to get the FLAC version then you can use the universal tradeable good, Bitcoin, instead. 
You don't have Bitcoin?  Well perhaps you can sell some of your upstream bandwidth to a streaming TV aggregator in exchange for Bitcoin, or in exchange for access to the latest episode of House of Cards - or in exchange for that FLAC encoded version of Money.

Thanks, that makes sense. Although that's not what people who are not familiar with the blockchain-specific use of the term 'spending' would interpret from this graph. 
 Not sure who MIT expect its target audience to be:  
A- People who use the technically correct blockchain-context definition of 'spending' this is a meaningless metric because you don't stimulate commerce nor create value by transferring your money from your checking account to your savings account and calling that 'spending,'  
B- For people who aren't familiar with that usage, this looks like "Buying non bitcoin goods by trading them for Bitcoin, establishing a value for one by association with the other". Even that is really misleading due to the main thing bought with bitcoin these days, altcoins, is just another form of self-spending.  I suppose exchange fees (and their ultimate use in real-world salaraies, servers etc) allow some real-world spending to evaporate off the event horizon of this self-contained little crypto universe.

People need to know that the Bitcoin network can only process 7 transactions per second, and that this is not only not easy to fix, it does not appear to be a concern nor a priority for the people promoting Bitcoin to the public and to professional investors.  
As someone who was attracted to Bitcoin in large part because of its potential for pervasive microtransactions, a real problem in search of a real solution and a major selling point of the brand, I am concerned that we are sitting here, billions of dollars in market cap come and gone, and come again, yet Bitcoin is still not a solution for this, and the higher the price goes, the farther we get from it being one.  
Bitcoin's valuation is is still composed of 1 part real world utility, to 3 parts promotional huckster "sell the headline today, retract on page 4 tomorrow" thinking.  Following the money in this small and young community reveals that this should be no more a surprise to anyone who cared to look, than MTGox's fall was. 
MtGox has prompted me to reexamine the motives of a lot of people in this industry - most especially the ones who are trying to pin all of the negative karma around bitcoin solely and exclusively on Mark Karpeles.

Gox did not pay customers or in any way compensate them for the deposit of Bitcoin. In fact quite the opposite - Gox charged a storage fee for the coin upon withdrawal. 
Gox customers did not ever in any way enter into a contract of sale for those coin to Mt.Gox when they sent them there.  Thus Gox does not own the coin.  End of story.  No contract of sale or debt: no ownership.  
The court cannot liquidate assets that do not legally belong to Gox, effectively stealing property from Gox's own customers, who were *not the parties at fault*, to pay debts of the party that *is* at fault.

i didnt say they were.  The point is that just because something is good for business owners in some superficial zero sum sense, does not mean it is remains an advantage when all of the contingent factors it will influence (like how your legitimate customers will shit on you in reviews and not recommend you to their friends, leaving the door open for your lunch to be eaten by your competition who does allow chargebacks) are considered.  
There are economic pressures motivating Visa and friends to implement and maintain the nontrivial complexity required to support a chargeback mechanism at all; it would make their lives much simpler to just take it away and play by 'Bitcoin rules', but they don't.   No other company has seized this brilliant gap in their strategy to sell a competing card network that does not allow chargebacks, and this isn't because nobody thought of this idea before. 
There are a small niche of businesses that may net benefit from 'no chargebacks' as a policy, the same way that a small niche benefit (or simply cannot realistically operate without) a 'no refunds' policy. For the vast majority of the rest it is not a feasible policy.

I believe Bitcoin can fail* if it keeps being pressed into an ill-fitting role as a *new form of currency*, when it is really the first example of a *new form of property* that is at once a commodity and a globally valid contract for the socioeconomic value of that commodity.  Bitcoin is a new kind of property in a really revolutionary way, much more so than as a mere replacement for fiat and payment systems.  
\* I don't mean fail in the sense of complete obliteration, which is extremely unlikely, but in the sense of "it won't become a functional currency" because it is actually too flexible for that. Bitcoin is the archetypical good of an emerging post-currency property ecosystem where all goods circulating withing it are valued not only in terms of one unit of account but in terms of each others' relative blockchain-backed value.  
Ex: I can ~~sell~~ trade you a 128kbps MP3 of Pink Floyd's last live performance of "Money" for, say, 0.01 Bitcoin, or I can ~~sell~~ trade you a lossless FLAC encoded version for 0.02 Bitcoin.  *OR* I can ~~trade~~ sell you that FLAC encoded version in exchange for that e-ticket you won in the office pool for the Wiggles concert next week, without involving any 'currency' at all -  or if the spot market values of these goods don't quite align then one of us gets a few millibits in change, and all of this happens seamlessly, automatically, immediately, and (optionally) anonymously. 
This can happen when my Pink Floyd MP3s and FLACs, your Wiggles ticket, and Bitcoin are all goods floating on a globally tradeable blockchain-backed ecosystem with constant real time values shifting in response to real time market forces. In this scenario, Bitcoin becomes a special form of commodity that performs the social benefit of universal fungibility.

This very neatly illustrates one problem with trying to use a unit as both a currency and a store of value.  It's nearly impossible to price things in a useful way without first comparing both to another, independent pricing unit.

You do know that HFT shops special 'cheat code' to see market data before the rest of the market is nothing more than physical proximity, don't you?  Most of their expenses come from building out server capacity that is as close as possible to the servers that run the exchanges they are trading in, and this means paying nosebleed-inducing rates for real estate, colocation, and operating costs.  
Some even resort to line of sight laser links between buildings to get around physical or territorial obstacles preventing a straight copper/fiber path, all in an effort to shave an extra microsecond or two off of RT latency.  There is nothing wrong with that, it is optimization, not foul play.  And they all do the same thing so one HFT shop's gains are quickly mitigated by a competitor building out capacity just as close, if not closer.  
If one HFT shop were to gain a solid, unassailable advantage over its peers in this area they would quickly shut out all other traders and we'd have headline news stories 24/7 about the catastrophe that would result.

Just saying "bitcoin isn't like anything seen before so you cannot compare it to $example" is fundamentally broken logic, because by talking about percentage growth rates in a fractional unit exchange price (i.e. one Bitcoin, one share, one dollar) or in market cap (or M1, or what have you)  at all you are already conceding the point that Bitcoin *can* be compared to other business investments even if you only wish to do so when that comparison reflects favorably on Bitcoin.

As far as I can tell, Japanese law (going by what I can glean from the Companies Act of 2005 and the older 1896 Civil Code and Commerce Code which the Companies Act largely supersedes) would seem to categorize Bitcoins (the ones held at Mt. Gox) as goods held on consignment, and Mt.Gox was never an exchange at all, but a kind of specialized consignment shop with responsibilities to handle goods deposited within it similar to that of a commercial warehouse.  
Mt.Gox is set up as a KK, and in their (actually their parent, Tibanne) KK registration certificate (which, being dated post 2005, appears to conform to the Companies Act) I did not see any indication that they applied to be either a Member Commodity Exchange nor an Incorporated Commodity Exchange under the Commodity Exchange Act. I could be wrong here for sure, and the application to be a MCE could have been filed separately, but again this should have been listed on their website if so.
This means a few things:  
1:  as a warehouse holding customer goods on consignment, they should have had Bitcoins insured as client property.  Obviously this was not done (and probably not even doable, to be fair. how could anyone underwrite the risk of Bitcoin losses without affecting the market as a result of declaring a replacement value for them?).
2:  As consigned goods are the sole property of their clients, there is no possible way they can be transferred to corporate ownership or be otherwise subject to corporate-directed disposition without a failure to perform a required duty (i.e. failure to pay a storage or consignment fee or some other duty) on the part of the client. 
3: as a corollary to 2 above, there should not be a way to return Bitcoins to their clients in any other form than the one in which they were entrusted to MTGox's care - that is, as Bitcoins.
disclosure:  I am not a lawyer, japanese or otherwise.  I'm also not party to any of the current lawsuits or schemes to rehabilitate or save MT.Gox, though as Mt.Gox client I have a vested interest in seeing things made as close to whole as possible.

considering a lot of people used BitcoinBuilder to buy goxcoin at well below 0.25 'real' (a lot of them bought at half that, or less) BTC, plenty of people would be just fine with this plan. I lost a couple play money coins in Gox myself, but considering that between Feb 5th and Feb 28th I was able to trade them up over 400%,  even 25% still puts me about even on my original deposit (not counting the stupid amount of time spent in front of charts trying to ride the insane death spiral volatility).  
But realistically speaking, I doubt even half of that is what will ultimately be offered.  I expect the first proposal to be a "take it or leave it" 15% of your original BTC guaranteed, otherwise you can sue us and see how far you get.  I'd still lose money in that scenario but I'd consider it.  I'm sure people with much more lost down the Goxhole would not be as open to this plan though.

well, one of the options is definitely Hold, per the status quo.  So that leaves the other option...  At this point it doesn't matter if one bitcoin is moved from his original stash, or 1,000, or 100,000.  The immediate effect on the market will be the same:  large-scale reaction selloff as people realize the guy is still around, still alive and still in control of his wallet(s), and definitely capable of liquidating some or all of the rest of his coin.  
I think Satoshi made a mistake by not keeping coins in some kind of periodic circulation cycle, even if just a portion of them moved from wallet to wallet every few months, because now he/they can't move any of them without negatively destabilizing the skittish market until the final disposition of his/their coin holdings becomes apparent.  Because of this, in terms of impact on prices, unlike a normal investor, even a large holder like Draper, there is no "sell" option for Satoshi, there is only "Dump".

I am willing to bet that many of the smaller exchanges (and probably the big ones as well) had BTC in mtgox for a number of reasons.  The small ones will start dropping like flies soon (and already have) because they are now insolvent themselves.  The bigger ones will probably find ways to absorb the loss and not mention it (though this is "MtGox will make it through" thinking at work here).  I have a feeling Karpeles knows this, and maybe &lt;tinfol&gt; is trying to wait out the carnage to resuscitate Gox after many of the other exchanges die of starvation and a reborn Gox with lessons learned and changes made looks good by comparison&lt;/tinfoil&gt; 
850k bitcoins is a *lot* to lose if you only are counting noobs with a handfuls of expensive coin, people who were trying to arb (a tiny fraction of the bitcoin population would be in a position to do this) and a few traders with small high risk amounts in there 'just in case'.

Do you understand the concept of either/or?
Bitcoin used to be in failure condition A the 'too cheap' era, back when it was only hobbyists and geeks mining it for so long at a loss (CPU mining days, and some periods during GPU mining era).  
It now is in condition B, the 'too expensive' era and it will either stay here indefinitely or fall back to condition A which could quickly turn into a systemic nosedive scenario as it would have to compete on more equal footing with an armada of altcoins that didn't exist the last time Bitcoin could be mined on GPUs.

The internet already went through a dress rehearsal of the Bitcoin vs. Credit Card show over a decade ago, but standing in for Bitcoin back then was a centralized currency-like token system called Flooz.  Not only did Flooz naturally enable new forms of scam activity unique to its own business model, it made old school credit card scammers' lives considerably easier.  
What we collectively learned from this, and hopefully haven't collectively forgot (though we rather prefer not to discuss):

I, personally, don't care who Satoshi is but I can understand if professional investment analysts evaluating the risk profile of Bitcoin for their clients would like to know what his plans are, or at least have a working idea of his personality and objectives.  I doubt anyone in finance cares much what kind of a person he is; given the kind of people who inhabit the finance world it would be hard for Satoshi to out-scoundrel any of them and they know it. They just want to know, for practical reasons, if he's planning on dumping some significant portion of his holdings at some point. 
In fact I think Bitcoin would be a lot healthier if Satoshi would just cash in already and clear the air of the spectre of them/him doing it out of nowhere someday. It would nuke the price for a few weeks but once that is digested, the rebound would be spectacular, particularly if it turned out Satoshi was someone already known.

What I don't understand is, what happens next? The practical problems with this scheme make it seem extremely far fetched: 
1. Does Bitstamp, et al somehow not notice a gigantic cumulative sale of freshly deposited coin from a handful of user accounts that just so happen to be connected to MtGox / Karpeles?  
2. Why would Karpeles risk putting his scheme and fortune at the mercy of his own competition's discretion - when they could decide to freeze his / Gox's accounts at any time for even the slightest suspicion of fraud?  
3. Also how could this not be seen in the blockchain - multiple immense tranches of coin have to move from Gox to the other exchanges in order to be sold and this would need to be done right in the full view of the bitcoin network. 
4. IF Karpeles is selling the coins for cash, how could the accounts payable staff at these exchanges not notice something a little odd when they were making, again, a sudden series of enormous wire transfers to bank accounts that all say ROBERT MARK KARPELES (or one of his close associates) on them?  
I find this "selling customer's coins on other exchanges" scenario very hard to believe for these and other reasons. You'd have to have the other exchanges in on the scam for this to have ever had a chance of succeeding.

These services exist as scaffolding to support a protocol that is unable to withstand the weight and demands of the network it has created.  This means the protocol has succeeded as an experiment because lessons were learned, but failed as a tool because the lessons can't be applied without grafting and patching. 
Keep the blockchain, scrap bitcoin, recreate it with these and other critical solutions designed in to the protocol itself and we'll have a real chance at replacing the need for visa, western union, and paypal, rather than just reinventing all of the existing currency systems piece by painful piece.

This is more or less the idea that got me excited by Bitcoin last year, before I even bought a single Satoshi.   Yet no easy to use (or even 'not easy to use') microtransactions platform exists for Bitcoin, despite that application being the most obvious killer app of this technology imaginable at this stage of adoption. "Obvious", as long as you don't have more than a general grasp the concepts of Bitcoin and the blockchain, mining and so on, at least.  But the closer you look the more the business case falls apart right before your eyes and that is why there is no traction for Bitcoin in the nascent 'internet of things' economy.   * edit - note that I said Bitcoin, not 'the blockchain'; the trustless distributed public ledger is not the same thing as Bitcoin, and has a much happier life of its own ahead.
The problem is that it will never work due to the way mining incentives and speculation together cause the costs of running the bitcoin network to be too high, and too volatile even when low, to sustain the hashpower necessary to process microtransactions at a price, in terms of TX fees, that would make microtransactions economically feasible on a widespread basis.  
Could you cobble something together that appears to work -*and not lose money*- for now, by using using zero fee (or extremely low fee, say 1-10 sat) transactions?  Probably, in fact you could likely even find an angel to fund your idea if you got them exited enough to jump in without waiting to learn the entire story.  But you cannot bet your entire business on hoping 'free' transactions will make it through the network on a timely basis forever.  
*  edit 2 - I would also like  to add that I don't consider tipping to be the same as microtransactions, more of a specialized case where the tipper isn't necessarily interested in profiting from the transaction.  That being said it's probably the best approach right now to tackling the "what do I need this for" average user question.

I think something similar to this, though I don't ascribe it to Bitcoin specifically.  Blockchain technology stores information in a way that creates an inseparable bond between location and value. It's a form of space for information where the potential of every particle is the sum of all of its prior causes, and causality is defined by two irreducible, non-overlapping properties: location, and value.  No two particles can exist in block-space which have an overlap of both of these properties without there having been a collision of their causal chains and subsequent merger into one particle (or else split the space itself, creating a multiverse, and the bitcoin implementation of the blockspace concept prunes minor multiverses; though it is conceivable that other implementations could specifically encourage their creation).  
I concede that this isn't nearly as straightforward as your way of explaining it though :D

This update page appears to be running on a different system than the main MTGox site was, so perhaps 2FA is not linked to it, and may not be necessary since you cannot make any changes to your account.

Billions?   Maybe things will be different in a year but I doubt there are billions of dollars worth of cost basis in the entire bitcoin market right now, all combined.  Just because one Bitcoin is valued at $630 doesn't mean all 12.5 million of them are.  Also you don't need to throw the entire market if it's close enough to push over (like within $20 of the cutoff valuation) with a small rally.

Why would you think a company that specializes in Bitcoin would go out of its way to avoid using Bitcoin to handle the one use case that suits Bitcoin the best: mass transfers of funds at very low cost to several hundred thousand people across the globe? 
I can't see how converting BTC to cash would help Gox in any way as they are already short on fiat, and converting a non-valued 'good' to a cash equivalent and then setting up some kind of service to allow withdrawals in fiat for the great many Gox account holders who do not have fiat accounts set up with them means they have to wire tens of thousands of tiny payments that could be worth less than the wire fee and processing costs themselves. 
 Plus this would trigger unfavorable tax consequences for your firm as well as for the the claimants, and since you don't own their goods in the first place (Gox doesn't own their users BTC, it held them on consignment), you can't "sell" them for whatever price you please, you have to return them in the form they were given to you or get approval for the sale from the claimants, which is another complicated, costly and impractical logistical mess.

I have called the call center number twice, once using English and once using Japanese, and both times the attendant confirmed that this update was placed here to satisfy a legal request for a method of verifying balances in anticipation of an upcoming claims filing process.  
I don't think it likely that hackers would be able to take over and then staff a call center with competent (though minimally familiar with Bitcoin) attendants without incurring significant costs and exposure to discovery.  
It could very well be the case that Karpeles didn't even want to do this. The benefit of using a web form is that there is no implied expectation of a reply as there would be with an email notice, and creating an email system would both be just as hard to trust as well as being even more dangerous since 
1. you could send financially sensitive information to an old, disused email account and 
2. the Bitcoin world is full of phishing scams - I am getting them from my Bitstamp account (I use separate email addresses for all my accounts), and even from a Coinbase "account" which I don't even have, but which was sent to the address I use to set up with BTC-e.

He did not say all of the coins were lost to hackers IIRC.  I have to check the press conference again but I think he (or perhaps his lawyer) chose his words carefully by stating there was a hack that resulted in loss, and stating separately, that 750k coins were the total lost. 
The BK filings were probably not part of the original plan (or at least, the original timeline), and they were forced into seeking protection on Monday because the first of the multi-plaintiff suits were to be filed that coming Wednesday, and they needed to go into extreme damage control to fend off the suits which certainly would have nuked any prospect of recovery for Gox and for the vast majority of it's account holders, with only the plaintiffs and their lawyers picking the remainder of the carcass clean.

I'd advise reading comment histories before doing this; I've come across more than one user who posted what looked like an unhelpful negative comment and was tempted to tag, but reading deeper revealed that I wouldn't disagree with most of what they said in the past - the comment made more sense in the larger context. 
I find tagging to be most useful when it tells you something about the context of someone - for example people who complain about what the Bitcoin Foundation is or is not doing, but who have shown support for one of its members but appear to have a beef with one or more of the others.  This is the kind of context that helps you figure out what a given comment they make later on may really be aiming at.

This would be true if Bitcoin were considered money by Japanese law.  But it isn't.  It's considered property.  Bitcoin held by Mt.Gox are consigned goods owned by their customers and for which Gox charged a fee for holding which was exacted upon withdrawal. Gox does not and did not ever 'own' them so they are not legally corporate assets at all.  Nonetheless, as they say possession is 9/10ths of the law in practice.  
Also Gox does not even remotely resemble nor would it ever fit the legal description of a bank. It's nothing more or less than a specialized consignment system combined with a cloud storage warehouse service to hold the goods being traded.

The merchants that have come in are largely speculators (short or long) themselves. Overstock Man has come right out and said so. There are people who fit both descriptions, and many of those are the ones signing up for Bitcoin as merchants. The rest are minor fringe case businesses looking for any possible means of drumming up new income ( or savvy opportunists (Branson) looking to capitalize on the media attention to Bitcoin.   
There is no trend (yet) toward adoption by ordinary people who have no interest or concern about Bitcoin-the-cult apart from its advantages as a payment processing system, because right now, it has no net advantages.  
For the new, would-be Bitcoin user, all of the positives are offset by negatives, so some other bait must be dangled inside the church doorway to draw them inside - that bait is currently "OMG 500% returns! Don't think, just act!" Crypto pricing will succeed in some form, some day.  Bitcoin (or any "coin") is not going to be that form.  It won't die, like IRC didn't die.

Right. There's always a pool of bids available to purchase unreasonably low asks, and likewise there are always asks waiting to sell to unreasonably high bids.  The sense of having sells outnumbering buys isn't in terms of total transaction counts not being balanced, which of course they are. It's that excessive sell orders execute below the market price, and there are not excess demand pressure to bring the price back up.  Also in MtGox we had a very unique situation in that there was a finite amount of Fiat and BTC in circulation, as there was no way to withdraw either for a couple days.  So there should have been a point reached where there was simply no longer any incentive to sell BTC any more, since it would be impossible to make a profit (or even break even after fees) for the seller, it's time to slow down and wait for demand to catch up. Yet this never happened.

 "The amounts involved were small enough, not more than a few entire counties on a daily basis, that anyone could be expected to miss it until they were neck deep in the Atlantic ocean as we are here in what used to be Washington DC"
The agency is now working on a plan to restore the missing land using raw materials mined from the Moon, a project to be financed by arbitraging valuable remaining real estate parcels in Hawaii and Alaska, and by asking Russia and China, very nicely, to donate portions of their unused terrain for the sake of the greater good of humanity.

Andreas Angelicus specifically blasted MtGox for taking transactions off the blockchain. 
Third party dependency is the opposite song of what Bitcoin "trust thy faith in the holy protocol and not in 3rd parties" choir is singing.
The cracks are getting hard to ignore here. 
I got interested in Bitcoin primarily due to the potential for microtransactions, and let's just say the bloom is off the rose for me on that front, and many others.  This is not an easy problem to fix and there is no coordinated way to address fixing it without forking the client and the blockchain.
Hal Finney's work with payment channels looks promising but still early stage and seems to require too much endpoint cooperation. Ethereum is elegant looking, way too complex with all sorts of unexplored corner cases to get snagged on at this stage.
Bitcoin is becoming the God of the Gaps of crypto.

Not all, and probably not even most, of the transactional data that impacts Bitcoin can be derived from the blockchain.

People can also just trade possession of wallets, moving bitcoin ownership, without ever touching the blockchain itself.

If you were so sure that MtGox was going to fail then your Bitcoin was never worth what it was before MtGox tanked anyway. You never had that value and you should have priced in the certainty of a MtGox failure that you *knew* was coming and discounted it the whole time.

If the number quoted is true and confirmed, then that is about a 6% writeoff of all BTC in existence.  
In a sane world, that would cause about a 6% rise in market price. But this being bitcoin, I would plan for at least a 15-20% rise, perhaps higher momentarily. It's also possible that this rise was already priced in to the "post-Gox-is-closed" bounce we had.  
It's also possible that we'll hear about another scandal in a few weeks and we are back at $400 again.  We're using complex-sounding financial language, economy 2.0 memethink, and the reliable logic that past performance either is or isn't an indicator of future value depending on the timescale you choose to use, to make ourselves feel intellectually comfortable with what is in fact little more than a bet on the horses.

I think this is not really the right way to look at it.  What really separates Bitcoin from a typical investment is that Bitcoin-the-network lacks any sort of balance sheet. It has no reportable earnings, nor expenses. It does have both, there's just no realistic way to get anything like accurate numbers on what they are, so it's impossible to figure out if it is actually profitable (apart from speculation) or not.  Yes, this even applies to mining.
Which brings up the second major problem with valuation.  Bitcoin is a made out of a unique (maybe the first?) form of economic matter which i am not even sure we have a name for yet (I've heard DAC thrown around):  It is an asset that is at once a ~~product~~ service *and* the asset that represents a share in the profitability of that service *and* a capital investment in the infrastructure of that service, all at the same time.  It's very hard to model predictions with Bitcoin because these three facets are usually distinct from one another in a normal business.

Not everything that is good in other cryptos can be patched in to Bitcoin by a software update.  It is very unlikely that any change to Bitcoin's protocol or behavior that would require a hard fork of the client and a splitting of the already enormous blockchain would be implemented.  The more traction Bitcoin gets, the *less* likely it is that it can be improved because of this inertia.
The solution to many Bitcoin protocol shortcomings is to implement services on top of it, but this can lead right back to the place we don't want to be to begin with: dependent on third party companies to keep the spice flowing.

Mining works fine to incentivise the initial bootstrapping of the network when there are few if any places to use the coin in an economic capacity, but it is an expensive way to keep it running after it has scaled up to the size that Bitcoin has.  
Proof of Stake (introduced first for Peercoin, I believe) and more recently, Proof of transaction (introduced by Fluttercoin) are alternative blockchain confirmation and securitisation systems that shift the incentives and work from mining alone to a hybrid of mining as saving and mining as spending, respectively.  It may be worth considering a look at both as possible ways to spread the costs and rewards of securing the network beyond the scope of dedicated and costly mining farms.

Don't forget they are still missing something like $30m in fiat as well, and that a number of lawsuits have been filed against them in various venues, which even if claims get settled or thrown out (extraordinarily unlikely) still will result in Gox paying some staggering legal bills.  That 200k BTC, if legitimately available and not a rumor, is likely to be cut in half by legal and reorganization costs.  Also trusted level accounts will probably get paid first, verified accounts second, and unverified accounts third.  Before all of these, missing fiat will probably be compensated ahead of missing Bitcoin.

The bots cost someone something.  Money already buys votes, so that part is not new.  But attaching a means to buy more of them with no indirection layer at all, just buy, vote, buy, vote, removes all the friction entirely.  People with money to buy votes will buy them, people with no money (or ethics above vote-buying) will not trust the vote counts, and the effect is that the forum or poll becomes a mere echo chamber for the interests that buy votes.  Which is useless to them as well.

All of the mooninites love to talk about their plans when they sell their coin for 5000, 10000, 40,000 each. They never seem to ask themselves who will buy for that much, and what would their motives be? Also if you need bitcoin to conduct any serious financial transactions in a post fiat economy where bitcoins are valued and fiat is not, selling your bitcoin for 10,000 means you are only going to have to buy it back for 10,001 at some point in order to function in that economy.

I think this bankruptcy move reveals that he has finally come to a conclusion about the realistic chances for recoverability of those coins. The number of coins is again off a bit from the leaked number, but of course in the wrong direction.  This implies that coins were continuing to be lost after the crisis draft doc was made.  Or they weren't there to begin with and Gox was selling ledger coins in hopes of generating profits off fees while they worked on solving the original lost coin problem.  
Never say never, and maybe somehow the original coins can be recovered.  Or maybe the air will be let out of the balloon a lot more and he can buy them back on the dark market for $50 each or something.  Who knows.  not really important in the short term so much as all the liquidity and more importantly, goodwill and enthusiasm that is now gone form Bitcoin. I think people are being a little optimistic and naive thinking that the only drag on Bitcoin from this is a few burned traders.

Regulation will happen one way or another if Bitcoin continues to cause harm to people.  We inside the community can blame it on this or that actor but that nuance will  be lost on the majority of observers (and it's spoiled by playing favorites anyway).  
The best thing that can be done here is to agree upon and implement passive regulatory structures in Bitcoin itself, like a requirement that any reputable exchange agrees to use a system that tracks the balance of coin flow inputs to outputs without revealing the addresses involved. That way no direct reporting on cold storage or hot wallets is needed, it would be a matter of just subtracting the total ask orderbook from the difference in input and output traffic and you should balance out to 0 if everything is above board.  Like a solvency windsock. As soon as that needle moves off 0 more than a handful of BTC, something is wrong and trading should stop automatically until adequate explanation is provided. No selling ledger coins, no use of unknown addresses. The only risk that remains in this arrangement is offline swaps of wallets. That would need to be addressed some other way.
I've suspected for a long time that many exchanges are undercapitalized in fiat, but I never imagined an exchange as old as Gox could have been short on bitcoin.

This depends on who you are dealing with.  Bank to bank ACH is usually a next day availability window, ACH with federal reserve is same day and in practice this is as good as instant because of float. At a technical level it doesn't even have to take that long, and it will get there.  
For retail banking yes you can see 3-4 day availability windows due to funds being put on security hold, policy, semi-manual (or totally manual) ACH initiation procedures used by many smaller banks. These same smaller banks would likely handle Bitcoin transfers the exact same way, should they somehow be persuaded to adopt it in place of or as an alternative to ACH.  But I would not expect this to be a concern for Coinbase.

They know who has what account and who they are wiring BTC-sale generated fiat to. Especially if it's hundreds of thousands of dollars worth all in a short period of time.

It seems to me that programmability and fungibility are mutually exclusive properties:  programmability would enable different units of the same currency to have different utility, and thus no longer be interchangeable at the same value unless the unique programming of each unit is reduced to the default state as part of the transaction.  
If this is the case, the units are not programmable as they have no better means of preserving unique state across transactions than any other form of electronic currency, including electronic representations of plain old fiat. 
Therefore either Bitcoin is not  programmable, or it is not fungible. Thoughts?

I wrote an analysis in mid Jan that concluded that a certain exchange (I left Gox's name out because I thought it was obvious who I was referring to) was on dangerously thin financial ice.  But even then I would never have guessed that they were low on BTC as well.  
If anyone can link to a detailed analysis that concluded that any exchange, MtGox in particular, was critically low on BTC any time before Feb 1, I would love to see it.  Not a one sentence guess, but with some rationale to back it up.  That writeup by Peter_R is great, but hindsight is 20/20.  I want to know who said this 'suddenly no BTC left' scenario was on the horizon, and when they spotted it, so I can frame their nick and hang it on my wall for inspiration.  Because clearly if they had a substantial chunk of BTC left, Gox could have played their way out of this disaster eventually.  Emphasis on 'could have.'

MtGox is not a financial institution, and Bitcoin are not securities nor currency according to Japanese law (and pretty much everywhere else except a few isolated cases).  There is a special type of entity that you must register as in Japan called a Member Commodity Exchange, and MtGox nor its parent Tibanne KK did not appear to be registered as such.  This leaves Mt.Gox as little more than an cloud-based consignment shop specializing in one particular type of consignment.  Fiat deposited with them may be a different story.

Thanks, I wasn't sure if I had missed the part where the decision logic was stored within the blockchain itself.  It sounds like that is still external to Bitcoin.  Also, the 10 minute consensus window (mempool) and permanent consolidation of that elected memory state as that window closes means "program" flow (such as it is) is effectively one-way, right?  
Sorry for all the questions,  I am trying to understand how it can be that Bitcoin is any more 'programmable' than, say, PayPal, when portions of essential state control apparatus (comparison logic and executive agency) are still external to the blockchain. It's not like you can map a certain set of UTXOs to a simple decision tree, close your wallet, and wait for the transactions to be triggered on their own, your client (or others made aware of your logic through a channel external to the blockchain)  have to perform this action.

"March 20, 2014
To everyone concerned
Mark Karpeles
Representative Director
MtGox Co., Ltd.
We inform you as follows with regard to the balance of bitcoins (BTC) held by MtGox Co., Ltd.
1. MtGox Co., Ltd. had certain oldformat
wallets which were used in the past and which, MtGox
thought, no longer held any bitcoins. Following the application for commencement of a civil
rehabilitation proceeding, these wallets were rescanned and their balance researched. On March 7,
2014, MtGox Co., Ltd. confirmed that an oldformat
wallet which was used prior to June 2011 held a
balance of approximately 200,000 BTC (199,999.99 BTC). MtGox Co., Ltd. investigated the presence of
these 200,000 BTC, immediately reported it to its counsels in the application for commencement of a
civil rehabilitation proceedings ("counsels"). A hearing took place on March 8 where a detailed
explanation of the situation was made to counsels. Immediately on Monday (March 10), counsels
reported the existence of the 200,000 BTC to the Court and the Supervisor.
2. For security reasons, the 200,000 BTC which were at first on the 7th moved to online wallets
were moved between the 14th and the 15th to offline wallets. These bitcoin movements (including the
change in the manner in which these bitcoins were stored) has been reported to the Court and the
Supervisor by counsels.
Further, the bitcoins held today by MtGox Co., Ltd. amount to a total of approximately 202,000 BTC,
including the above 200,000 BTC and the approximately 2,000 BTC which existed prior to the
application for commencement of a civil rehabilitation proceeding.
3. MtGox Co., Ltd. had previously reported about the disappearance of bitcoins which had
triggered this application for commencement of a civil rehabilitation proceeding that MtGox Co., Ltd.
had lost almost all of the approximately 850,000 bitcoins it held (approximately 750,000 BTC
corresponding to the balance of bitcoins belonging from users as seen from transaction records as well
as approximately 100,000 BTC belonging to MtGox). Taking into account the existence of the 200,000
BTC, the total number of bitcoins which have disappeared is therefore estimated to be approximately
650,000 BTC. (Please note that the reasons for their disappearance and the exact number of bitcoins
which disappeared is still under investigation and that the above figures may still change depending
on the results of the investigation.)"

I really cannot understand why this is so hard for people in this thread to grasp. 
Japan came out with an official legal position declaring Bitcooin as property in March.  It is not currency, it is not a 'deposit' or a loan in any financial sense.  
It is no different than dropping off a bunch of silver dollars at a pawn shop.  If the pawn shop gets robbed of 75% of its customers' consignments, they do not automatically get to liquidate the remaining 25% to pay the pawn shops own past due rent or the lawyer fees. The onus is on whomever is representing the claims of the MtGox Bitcoin customers to make this abundantly clear to the court appointed receiver.
Just because Bitcoiners think Bitcoin is a currency and should be treated as if financial rules apply to it doesn't mean the rest of the world agrees.

A: too cheap to be cost effective to mine nor useful for large transactions and nontrivial stores of value 
B: too expensive to be used for microtransactions - the very domain where it the protocol is in its natural environment and could have completely revolutionized the entire industry with new payment models, mesh sourcing, microcommisions, etc.

here, let me give you a punchline from a story I wrote about MtGox (though I didn't mention them specifically, but that was the exchange I had in mind when writing it) on Jan 19th.


[Original post, warning, long]( which was written to explain why exchanges would self-trade and at the time, the weirdness of the day were drop bots, which people thought were outside-run but I speculated were inside-run to frantically drum up business to escape a trap coming from balance sheets.  My assumption was at the time that exchanges were low on fiat. I didn't imagine they'd be low on BTC as well... 
I didn't specifically name MtGox in my story because I believe strongly that all exchanges are a different degrees of mess and mismanagement, and MtGox will not be the last to fall.  Thus the immediate and amazingly well coordinated unified front of them trying to single out Karpeles as the black sheep and thereby implying they are everything he is not.  Cool story, bros!

Bitcoin mining, as a whole, underwent an early and unexpectedly powerful hysterical positive feedback loop which drove the minimum threshold for profitable mining quite high.  
@_date: 2015-08-08 20:46:49
But realistically, they don't.   You must be quite familiar with all the password db leaks that overwhelmingly demonstrate that a lot of people just do not have (and will never have) the wide contextual awareness required to put the necessary effort into memorizing a password, or even a simple 4 digit PIN, let alone an arbitrary list of 12 or so nonsense words.  
The bitcoin zeigeist likes to talk about "being your own bank", but just leaves the discussion at that bumper sticker sales pitch level, letting people fill in their own implications for how it can be used.  And those implications are informed by decades, if not centuries of habitually trusting a network of specific fellow humans not to screw them even when given the opportunity, and by only interacting with that trusted group for important matters.  And guess what, for the most part this works.  Society hasn't collapsed because Suzie shares her debit card PIN with her husband and because or grandpa once shared a checkbook with his business partner. 
A 4-digit PIN is only somewhat safe to use because it is enhanced by one's own common sense personal privacy practices (or lack thereof) plus a 16-digit card number backing those up, plus the entire combined support infrastructure of the bank itself, plus the further support of law enforcement behind that, plus the average negative reaction of humanity to the behaviors of theft and deception behind everything above.  
Now, setting aside how secure all of that is in reality, the point is that people are conditioned to think they don't have to worry that much about losing their password or their PIN, or even their card itself, because of the hidden safety nets that underlie the security of those tools even if they are compromised by the user. 
Take someone conditioned to think of the importance of local security in the context of various shells of external security, and give them a tool that, unbeknownst to them, removes all trusted layers of security except their own efforts, and you will get people using "happy birthday password 1234" as their brainwallet phrase because they still habitually think of a bitcoin wallet in terms of an account at a bank even if they know, in principle, it is not.

I think the context of this tweet and the interest surrounding it is that the attack is *not* new, but for whatever reason, brainwallet.org seems to have facilitated a deceptively easy way to make very insecure keypairs which apparently allowed a lot of people to gain a false sense of security by using BW.org's tools.
BW.org should have made excessively simple and insufficiently random word combinations impossible or at least very hard to use, but there is a lot of sensitivity in the Bitcoin world over how hard it is for newbies to get started, thus their money can't enter the ecosystem and maintain the price. So this creates an overall bias against support for criticising a tool that is perceived to have given Bitcoin one of its greatest elevator pitch bullet points - you can store money in your head with a simple passphrase.  Technically this is true, but what "simple" means varies a lot among the general public.  
The matter had to be forced onto the stage, literally,  by someone proving that this was a risky and short-sighted way to handle Bitcoin's usability experience.

I'm a neutral observer in this soft fork hard fork, big/small block debate. I don't care whether XT wins or Core "wins" because I think Bitcoin's evolution is going to be ultimately informed by its contact with fixed natural boundaries and self-limiting pressures, and will end up looking the same one way or the other. 
What I really would like to know, again, as a non combatant who is useless to either side as a foot soldier, is:


what defines "enough" discussion?  There seems to be a disconnect between the way consensus is supposed to happen in Bitcoin (algorithmic refereeing of measurable, quantifiable economic assets)  and how it actually happens (human communication channel control,  a.k.a. the "conversation").

As things currently stand (and maybe this is an irresistible force of human nature), individual opinions do matter.  The Bitcoin system is not a self-governing intelligence, the "wisdom of the crowd" turns out to be the wisdom of a few well informed and well connected people who stand at the center of gravity and can push it in whichever direction they think is best, their push rippling out to the edge of the entire mass and shifting its center in that direction. 
Denying, rather than confronting, that this is what really controls the direction of Bitcoin is naive and short sighted.

Now we're seeing the community turn it's paranoid and excessively defensive in-group bias on itself, with much worse consequences.  
Bitcoin needs, among other things, a managed, non-code based forum for establishing the working mission statement of it's purpose, or these debates will turn into little more than popularity contests, mudslinging, vote-buying and finally balkanization.

Hey remember when you called me out some time ago for posting "confusing" shit about enough people being persuaded to tip the balance and all that?  
This is what I was talking about.  The definition of Bitcoin and the broader concepts it is a manifestation of are really not bound to lagging indicators of consensus like the snapshot of the code or hashpower or longest chain at the present moment.  They're bound to how many people can be persuaded to buy in to them.  For people to buy in to something there has to be a meaningful definition of that something to begin with.  
Whoever controls the human signalling sources that broadcast that definition the strongest (POW in meatspace) sets the direction for the rest of the POW mechanisms that most bitcoiners seem to think direct the consensus, but in fact are following it.  There's no Byzantine fault tolerance invented yet that can be an effective check on charisma and connections. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 08:43:24
A discussion breaking down and acknowledging all of the moving parts that contribute to how the entire systemic consensus is formed in Bitcoin would be useful-  Instead of endless circular arguments attributing it all to cut and dried, readily quantified inputs like hashpower or the current state of the code in Git or who has mod control of the bitcoin subreddit, as if these do not all play a role, and as if there are no other consensus signals contributing as well - including those that are hard or impossible to document or trace cleanly, and as if all of the above are not only inputs but also outputs feeding back into a rather messily organic hysteresis system. 
Everyone wants to win one for their side in a 3-post showdown (figuratively, not literally 3 exactly), and this creates pressure to oversimplify the premises so as to arrive at a slam dunk conclusion which fits that format.
@_date: 2015-08-13 21:38:19
I agree very much - though I would add that the scope of consensus extends even beyond the ledger, the size of your wallet, or hashpower, or control of Git levers.  It's about how much mental real estate you hold in Bitcoinland, by title or by proxy, and there is no up to date registry of who the major landowners are.

You're just clarifying my terms in a particular way, which means I didn't make them clear enough when I wrote them the first time.  
"Normal, non-ideologically motivated" in the context of Bitcoin refers to people who do not have any specific opinion about things many *Bitcoiners* commonly think are *super important* and which constitute a reason to participate in the ecosystem in and of themselves, regardless of whether Bitcoin is actually helpful or practical to use, or is even inconvenient compared with the default alternatives. 
Things like being against "the banks" or "the government", or having an acute sensitivity about surveillance, or a particularly high-minded notion of what freedom means, or feeling the need to eliminate centralization because of reasons. 
The people in the checkout line at the grocery store, dropping their kids off at daycare, looking for a promotion at work, playing a round of disc golf with their friends, organizing a family reunion - normal people doing normal things that you would see in a snapshot of any given gathering place on any given day, they are never going to "believe in Bitcoin" in any ideological sense of the term, no more than they "believe in the dollar" right now. Only Bitcoiners and members of neighboring clans such as gold bugs, think in these terms.  Normal people just *use* the dollar because its there, because it is convenient, because it works without excessive fuss or hassle, and because it is ubiquitous, and that is all.  
In a hypothetical world where Bitcoin is the dollar, it has to be as transparent and nonpolitical as the dollar (or euro, pick a currency) is for the majority of people at the majority of time. It cannot depend on people "believing" in it, it just has to work without getting in the way.  Right now that is a long way off.

Yes, I get that the people who held the coins essentially "invested" in the coins even if they hold them.  My comment was that it is commonly assumed, when this "where do all the mined coins go?"  issue comes up, that miners must sell all their coins to stay profitable. Obviously there is no reason to assume this, they could just as well be expected to hold them. Granted the last time I got into this conversation myself it was in not here, but this is still a common assumption. 
I wondered why I was getting upvotes at first, because I definitely expected 'truth hurts' downvotes for my original comment, which I now see was interpreted differently than I expected. 
My point is that just because $1m worth of coin is not being dumped on the open market every day, does not mean that $1m of in new demand is appearing every day. It could be speculators or miners (same thing in my book) doubling down on losses trying to call a bottom.  It could be the same old gamblers quenching their just-dice fixes.  It could be market makers getting ready to rig another bearwhale episode. It could be honest to jebus fresh-faced new mom n pop Bitcoin buyers just getting into the game.  It could be professional investors doing actual investing.  It could be (and probably is) all of these things in different proportions. Who is doing the buying matters, because it suggests different fundamental market inputs in each case.  Some are a lot more positive, in the long term, than others even if they all "buy" at the same price.

Your illustration was really very intuitive - The rules of the game are defined by whoever is winning it. 
Bitcoin has it's own rules, like baseball, but they are subject to rules from forces bigger than they are, and then are forced toplay the larger force's game regardless of what their own rules say. 
The universe has one big all-encompassing rule: that stronger forces will, on average, engulf weaker ones when the two are brought into conflict.   If the NY DFS were to be confronted by the UN and the federal gov and forced to change it's rules to suit those powers, it would most likely to succumb to this pressure. If the UN and NATO and every other country together were faced with an invading fleet of aliens with the ability to destroy earth, they are going to either be destroyed or integrate into the aliens's plans (assuming "destroyed" wasn't the only plan they have).  If that fleet of aliens is swallowed up in a freak supernova of our Sun while in the middle of playing their own little game with us,  they'd have to succumb to it.  
POW is profound because it acknowledges how the universe actually works, and rather than fighting it, it models it on a flexible, predictable and quantifiable scale.

You don't own it (money) anyway, nor are you your own bank.  It's like a giant co-op cash system: Bitcoin only works if other people also own it, and agree its worth owning. Likewise you are your "own bank" only insofar as you are using a system others also think is a suitably bank-like.  If you are on the wrong side of a hard fork (even unintentionally: don't get sick, go to jail, or otherwise tune out from the Bitcoin world for more than a couple months) you won't own much of anything really quickly.

Consensus is formed via control over the channels that humans use to talk about Bitcoin, everything else is secondary and consequential to this.  Network consensus follows from changes to the code, and both follow the narrative consensus.  Soft fork vs hard fork is a total red herring discussion here.
Bitcoin follows the path people want it to follow, and that path is dictated by the same old human group dynamics that have dictated the direction of every shared ideal since the dawn of human culture.  
Not advocating this, not even liking it, but I think it's the most pragmatic way to contextualize this impasse.

I understand, and I agree that he, like so many VC-funded blockchain projects, is trying to get a gravitational assist from Bitcoin, and so they all play fast and loose with terms like decentralized, database, blockchain, uncensorable, immutable. 
I don't like it, because technically it is inaccurate and comes across as being lazy at best, and deceptive at worst, but you won't get very far raising money if every pitch starts off with a preamble debate over exactly where, for example, bitcoin ends and blockchain begins.  The guy who chisels his pitch into a message that will resonate with casually-informed investors will get the money, and you won't.

Stop telling yourself this. It is not true, and you aren't giving anyone any useful tools to think about the problem of adoption with false and misleading histories of the internet.
It's hard to find anyone 30 years ago (1985) who wasn't in one of two camps on the internet, never heard of it at all, or using it every day.  Internet adoption in 1985 wasn't bound solely by public awareness, as Bitcoin is: If you tell someone about bitcoin in 2015, they can go get bitcoin and use it within a few hours.  If you tell someone about the internet in 1985, no matter how interested they were in trying it out, getting access to it was extremely difficult if they didn't work at a large academic, military or government institution, or one of a handful of private companies like BBN, GE and Tektronix.  
Internet had a good 'excuse' to be a topic restricted to a specific and small group of users and unfamiliar to everyone else in 1985. You either used it for work or school, or you didn't have access to it at all (unless your circumstances were extremely lucky). Bitcoin does not have a similar explanation in 2015, it lacks all the technical and infrastructural barriers that held up the internet in 1985. 
By 1993, the internet was already a huge topic and nobody wanted to be left behind.  For reference, Yahoo! didn't even exist yet, and we were already seeing things like **[this on mainstream TV]( and AOL had started drowning much of N. America in free trial CDs, but had already existed for several years alongside compuserve and prodigy, each gradually building up their dialup POPs as fast as they could.
As soon as there was a definable thing called the "internet" to connect to, most people were already interested in, if not actually capable of connecting to it.   
Just because someone's mom rolled her eyes once at their kid's request to run up the phone bill relaying the weekly FIDOnet mailbag doesn't mean the internet faced some kind of nonexistent uphill battle for public sentiment the way that Bitcoin does.

Do you foresee Bitcoin's change management process ultimately crystallizing into into a de facto political campaign?  
I do.  Do I like it? Not really. But it doesn't matter- complex systems in which human group behaviors supply the primary chaotic inputs tend to evolve familiar, convergent traits over time. 
What technology disrupts, human nature restores. 
Note to passersby tempted to read too much into this, "foresee" doesn't mean "want to see." Also a disclaimer: I won't be greatly affected personally by what happens to block sizes or the fork proposals.

Devil's advocate here:  The whitepaper was a consensus-derived  founding document (a consensus of one person is still a consensus) setting out the fundamental policies that constitute what is and is not possible for behavior that takes place "inside" the parameters of the Bitcoin universe.   BIPs, when "ratified" into code, are analogous to amendments.  We have an electoral college (miners' consensus), but it is not clear how the larger population of Bitcoinia comes to understand the finer points of proposed policy changes, nor how they can be represented in their implementation.  
It's tempting to ignore them as irrelevant, but consensus will form opportunistically wherever it wants and wherever it can, not necessarily where it is "permitted" by consensus rules or expected by experts.  It will always get what it wants, however.

If you want normal people to take Bitcoin seriously, you need to consider how the world works from their point of view.  Eventually, if Bitcoin is successful, its use will be dominated by the mindset of the people that make up the majority consensus today, so it's shortsighted to use language that alienates them, in addition to being needlessly controversial. 
If Bitcoin is going to become the norm, consider what a normal non-ideologically motivated persons motivations will be for using  Bitcoin.  Trying to radicalize everyone will not work.

No shadow conspiracy, it's Reddit choosing a community moderation model that encourages the creation of factions.  It's really simple: You can downvote something 5 times and make it disappear (taking it off the vote radar and out of the conversation), but you can upvote it 500 times and all that happens is ... it stays visible.  Downvotes are much more powerful than upvotes, which invites abuse and makes censorship brigading far too easy. The result is guaranteed echo chambers of groupthink. 
This peculiar and arbitrary arrangement has been pointed out plenty of times and yet hasn't been changed, so it is obvious that Reddit is well aware of the subreddit balkanization dynamic it sanctions, and prefers it that way because fomenting antagonistic tribalism is good for stickyness.

I think they will have to be forced into this approach by circumstance and market pressure, because they are not inclined to do it out of self interest otherwise.  There is little upside to do this from their POV.  
It's hard work, it makes them reexamine basic principles instead of setting them aside for now, for the sake of "progress on $my_pet_project", it removes many useful rhetorical tools, bluffs, and threats unique to the academic and priestly cartels (alumnus of both, personally) which are primarily used to play a sort of chess game wherein one's goal is to conquer and hold as much of the territory of expert influence and peer esteem as possible.  
Worst of all, it would invite, rather than ward off, the participation of the muggles in the process, who while not necessarily unwelcome, are untrustworthy and seen as a dangerous wildcard factor.

Authoritarianism is still authoritarianism even when it baked into infrastructure.  
People, that is, politics, will route around it in the long run.   
Decentralized governance requires agreement to cooperate. Coercion is fruitless, you will just get local domain bubbles of authority - a trust "black market" - and that's the beginning of the end.    To limit this you have to make that which is shared by all regardless of self interest, something agreed on by all.  And that means your system has to be extremely simple in what it signals, and thus dependent on a shit ton of external channels to have any value relative to them.  This is a system that does not resemble the fluid and sometimes ugly way reality allocates rewards, and reality will incessantly push back on it, pervert it, or sideline it until it does.  Sounds familiar?

You answered your own question with one good example. They can also sell existing assets for cash and buy bitcoin with that (or more cleverly, buy mining gear - and even if this gets seized by court order its very hard to prove how much coin was mined with it and where that coin currently is)  
You used to be able to send money orders to many exchanges (maybe you still can to BTC-e or some chinese ones) without KYC checks, and in the early days there was no KYC at all, anywhere.  OTC market and people who do business using WOT don't check who you are either, as long as you meet "vouched for" criteria specific to those places.

"Nanashi" took credit for leaking the original transaction logs linked only to account IDs IIRC, and there was a second leak of more data which connected a slice of actual contact info along with fiat and BTC balances to that account data so that a limited correspondence between real people's names and account activity could be generated with some effort and guesswork.  
My memory of these events is a but rusty now, but "Nanashi" (or someone under a different alias) further claimed (in an IRC session and I think in a handful of Bitcointalk posts or maybe even here as well?) to possess another, far more damaging cache of data containing all the KYC details and bank account details of verified users - but declined to release this as proof that they were a white hat who only wanted the truth to be revealed (through analysis of the transaction logs, i guess), to punish Gox but not its users.   
Shortly after this "Nanashi" (or possibly a copycat trying to capitalize on the opportunity the chaos presented) started threatening to release more data if they weren't paid 100 (or maybe it was 300) BTC but I don't think anyone seriously believed this was a legitimate threat.
This latter cache of information has not been leaked to the best of my knowledge. "Nanashi"  (the original and the opportunist copycat, assuming they are not the same) sort of just dropped off the radar.

The interesting thing is that these so called private blockchains are really the same thing, it's just that they are trusted by far smaller, far more niche communities who have no need to pay the high decentralization premium required for full interchange of trust between the entire unaffiliated world and themselves. 
Limited decentralization has a much smaller [decentralization premium]( that full decentralization, and a cost/benefit that makes sense at a scale and scope that where shared consensus over very niche-interest data needs to be established with a small pool of partially trusted niche peers. There are some interesting (and overall beneficial to Bitcoin) reasons to do this with a private blockchain instead of, say, a distributed database over a VPN.

I think having a sense of where the demand is coming from does make a lot of difference.  Not all buys are equally rational just because they pay an equal price.  There are different implications for a price supported by $1M in coins being bought to double down on prior losses by people underwater vs.  $1M in coin being purchased by brand new first time investors new to Bitcoin.

Right - the decentralization premium isn't fixed, it's a variable corresponding to how much of the resource budget of a given system must be committed to achieve the minimum degree of decentralization deemed sufficient to eliminate harm from counterparty risks native to that system.  
At one end, you have full centralization, with no decentralization premium and all counterparty risk is borne by all users. At the other, full decentralization, with the maximum decentralization premium.  How much your users are willing to pay for decentralization is related to how much risk they are willing to bear themselves, vs. how much they can be persuaded to pay for (in cost, ease of use, convenience, speed - not just money) through protections offered by decentralization.  
The premium doesn't model or indicate how efficient a given decentralization approach is, only how much of a systems resource budget is committed to whatever decentralization approach is taken.

Again you are 100% right.
The proof of this is so obvious it's painful.  Why does Bitcoin have a value at all? Because the ultimate economic majority, that is, "the rest of the world"  decided on a value for it.  
The only opinion that matters is that which is held by the economic majority, and Bitcoiners, who seem to want a world governed only by a sterile, spotless set of easily understandable mathematical rules, chafe against this fact.

Maybe I am just missing something obvious that everyone else having this discussion sees, but I have to point out that this way of referring to consensus seems to presume that there exists some means for all interested parties to know what that probability is at any given moment.

This is exactly the kind of explanation that I am talking about, of course acquisition expenses (which is what all those costs boil down to) have to be paid.  If you buy from an exchange, rather than mine, all those costs are abstracted into the spread price plus the exchanges' own fee structure.  You end up with the same equation.  Non-bitcoin in, Bitcoin out, less acquisition cost load. 
You did qualify your explanation with something that helps though:


I wouldn't argue that eventually, the miners will sell some of their coins. In fact that's precisely the point I am making - estimations of Bitcoin's market cap almost always imply or directly claim that the market cap is holding because the entire fixed rate of mining issued coin is being sold at market price, and the price isn't dropping at a steadily corresponding fixed rate, thus (hyperspace jump to conclusion goes here) it's all being purchased on the open market by new demand, every day.   
Strictly speaking, even miners holding on to new block rewarded coin is still 'investment', but it implies that different incentives are at work sustaining the price in that scenario, than in one where non-miners and other new investment interest is absorbing most or all of it, and the latter is the one that is the prevailing assumption.

The internet was still a relatively complicated thing to use in the early 90's, and in an era where everything was still largely dialup, had usability downsides especially in homes where one phoneline was shared by everyone.  People generally did not have a philosophical problem with the internet (a few opportunistic moralizing pundits aside), it was mainly just hard or impractical, or too expensive to use - and in many cases, simply not available in your area.  Techy people of a certain age group tend to remember resistance to the internet from others at the time as lack of interest, but this is only one facet of a much bigger complex of practical infrastructure obstacles it faced, most of which have no counterpart in the resistance Bitcoin faces.

This is a wry phrasing of what is in fact just a tautology. Of course it's inversely proportional, because all the irrelevant or uncontroversial aspects have been settled already and only the human factored ideological or functionally essential implications of the change remain.  And those are arguments about what the feature will be used for, not how it works. 
Being a "developer" (a label that gets nitpicked into irrelevance even if it applies) does not have any inherent bearing on whether one's arguments are valid (except as a means to obfuscate one's agenda in a cloak of jargon to sound authoritative to casual stakeholders) once the discussion reaches this point.

This is a very insightful clarification of what hashpower really means.  It regulates only those behaviors and actors that exist entirely inside the economic space carved out by a given network.

I don't think stating it as a problem (or a non-problem) is a useful characterization here. There are good things to say about both kinds of buying, at very least because both support the price *today*. 
I'm saying that existing believers buying $1/M day more means they are merely placing fresh bets on the same gamble that bitcoin will see wider adoption and demand.  It increases their exposure to risk, without diversifying it. 
But if new adoption (thus new demand from buyers in previously untapped markets) is where the $1M/day support is coming from, it means the gamble is paying off.

Speaking from somewhat baffling experiences with around a dozen interactions of my own, I can tell you that the interesting people in crypto (as in people who have unique, nuanced and insightful stories to share, not the circus of cookie-cutter hucksters looking for free PR or a VC introduction) are unusually reluctant to talk about anything at all.  Strong undertones of concern over possible negative reprisals and suspicion of being "set up" or having one's words taken out of context to support or undermine some crypto tribal agenda.  Plus a lot of people are simply unable to discuss their situations due to ongoing legal engagements or because they have some questionable skeletons in their closet they'd rather not risk being discovered. 
The net effect of this is to produce puzzling interactions where, to cite one strikingly consistent pattern,  conversations exchanged over multiple emails, PMs, DMs, IMs will inexplicably stop and go unanswered for days or weeks, and then just as suddenly, will pick up again as though nothing unusual happened. Or there will never be another reply at all.  Tracking people down by phone can be dicey as well, even if the number is public, because many of the motives for doing so are rightly viewed with suspicion.  
Honest reporting requires trust, and trust takes a long time to earn (and is easily lost) - this is more true in the crypto world than many other places.  A lot of 'journalism' that happens here decays into pay-to-play very quickly - even if it began with high standards, because of the inherent misalignment between the time and effort required of quality journalism vs the convoluted and rapid pace at which the trends, players and facts evolve.

Bandwidth improves the rate  sequential tx can be issued by one endpoint, Alice to another, Bob.  It does not improve the rate that an unaffiliated Alice and Bob can independently send tx to Charlie unless Alice and Bob are coordinating or are on the same link. When you have 100000 Alice's bobs and Charlies all in different locations, all originating separate tx, some with competing time sensitive claims on their tx, bitcoins's minimum guaranteed consistent state interval with respect to tx order drops to the best case interval for a single tx to reach the most distant node on the network.

After they are confirmed and the order is finalized.  The bandwidth available to block propagation is not relevant to my point, which is why I said block size has no meaningful bearing on this issue even though you want it to be about that.
While they are waiting to be included in a block they are not done being "transmitted" yet for the purposes of record, even if they have been sitting in everyone's mempool for the past 48 hours.  Nodes originating Tx near the edges of the network geographically farthest from the highest concentration of hash power at any given moment (and thus highest probability of not being included in the next block all else being equal) will always be at a disadvantage to those nearer to it, even if they pay a higher fee than everyone else.

^ this.    The block size is also a function of latency.  A simulation was done but IIRC it was strangely set up to assign transmission speed a delay of 0, as in infinite speed of light. 
I suspect that even taking block sizes out of the picture altogether, and modeling the network as a bunch of simple FIFO queues with no confirmation CPU time required, and Tx's as being conveniently preassigned unique order IDs, with "confirmation" being as minimal as possible, by simple numerical sequence, you will reach a dynamic system limit bounded by the speed of light (latency) propagating across the entire graph before the system can scale to 1000's of Tx/sec.

@_date: 2015-07-24 18:09:56




I assume we now agree that yes, they must be processed one at a time.  Doing 10 million Tx per second, sequentially, would still be doing them one at a time. They are explicitly ordered.  This is important in a system that has non-negotiable performance limits because it means you can calculate an upper boundary on the guaranteed delivery time of any single transaction, and this is where the cost/performance compromises I referred to in my original post begin to be felt. 
I later elaborated that the 7.5tx/sec (or double that, for a lazy ACK model) number represents an upper boundary on Tx processing as constrained by this parameter. Since Tx *must* be confirmed in an explicit time-dependent sequence in order to establish priority, I chose to illustrate this with what I expected to be obviously simplified ideal conditions where all technical limitations and obstacles are removed except for the one that cannot be removed - the speed of light - and applied this in the most extreme yet realistic case, with nodes situated on opposite sides of the planet. 
The best time resolution (and since Tx as now established DOES have to be processed one at a time, this also means the best consistent state resolution) such a network can guarantee is therefore constrained by this parameter. It doesn't even matter what the block size is or confirmation time is. In fact the entire concept of blocks doesn't even need to exist to understand this.  
You are the one who referred to a 3tx/second hard protocol limit, and I think you projected that on to the rest of this discussion. I am not talking about lifting an arbitrary protocol limit or advocating any "side" in the block size debate here.  I am pointing out that 3000 Tx/sec is not going to happen in "real time" (which as the other troll arguing with me on this pointed out, is a loosely defined concept, which is true and rather convenient for you), ever, in Bitcoin, without compromising on one or all of the rest of the characteristics I laid out in my original statement: full decentralization, globally consistent valid state, full redundancy.

This is with no CPU time used, only two nodes, no intermediaries, no switching, no confirmations, no geographical obstacles, no minimum block time, no mining. Just a ping, basically, under thought experiment-level optimal conditions. In reality conditions are much much less favorable.
Bitcoin processes transactions serially. Like I said, without a way to defeat the speed of light you cannot have anything close to real time plus full redundancy, globally distributed decentralized state propagation.  compromise in one or more of these parameters is fundamentally unavoidable

I'm afraid that Bitcoin, being an attempt to found a novel universal philosophical system at the atomic level - as a self-trusting social value signalling platform, is 'about' the science of distributed systems only about as much as astronomy is 'about' the science of optics.  A holistic model and framework cannot be derived upwards from a chosen set of physical parametric limits and constants because it privileges those same limits and constants and only acknowledges others when they can no longer be ignored ("our models didn't account for X" - and the universe has an infinite supply of X's).  This is why technocrats do not last long in leadership roles.
Complexity theorists (i.e. Santa Fe institute &amp; friends) have largely ignored what is going on with Bitcoin, if they are aware of it at all, which is unfortunate because that is the field that addresses (or at least attempts to understand holistically) the chaotic, fluid system of social and resource signaling channels that ["Bitcoin" is increasingly being forced to acknowledge are far stronger forces governing its fate than its own tidy clockwork economy.](

Every transaction depends on knowing the final state of previous transactions, they have to be explicitly ordered thus processed one at a time. You cannot confirm Bob can take possession of Alice's coin unless you are certain Alice still has the coin to give him and hasn't spent it to somewhere else already.  This is a pretty a basic Bitcoin 101 concept here.  I think you're deliberately trying not to agree with anything, whatsoever, at this point.

Was it for a sierra?   I nearly bought two of those in the first preorder block back in Dec 2013 / early Jan 2014, but my suspicions about the overall sketchiness of the "Bitcoin ecosystem" were beginning to develop into full blown doubt around that time, so I held off on putting the required deposit down until I personally talked to someone there, and if possible arranged a tour of their facility.  
I called their number and was pleasantly surprised to get an actual human being instead of voicemail.  But the stilted and awkward conversation I had with 'Eduardo', who gave the impression of being a temp employee (would not have guessed he was the CEO) convinced me not only not to buy anything from this shop, but to take a hard look at what I really thought Bitcoin was worth (these were the days of $1000 coins) given the considerable practical drawbacks it had and who benefited from the prevailing "alignment of incentives". 
Ultimately that phone call was a turning point; it tipped my bullshit meter just enough that I liquidated most of my holdings shortly thereafter, and I have not purchased a single coin ever since.

It's even worse than that.  Pools are great stalking horses to hide large scale concentrations of centralized mining power behind.
The biggest miners don't need to centralize behind pools they don't control (and the risk of being outed by that pool's traffic analysis), when they can set up and control pools of their own to obscure that they are already centralized to start with. 
Big miner has 51% of all hash power on tap, but wants to hide this, so they put a third of their assets behind one pool, a third behind another, and a third behind another.  All three pools appear to be "competing" for hash power from the outside, when they are really one large pool mimicking the behavior of several smaller ones. Until the right time.  
@_date: 2015-08-05 20:00:28
Why is the assumption that miners sell all their coins still so common?
I have never seen a good explanation of this.  Professional miners are in a position identical to professional speculators, they just go about their buying differently, and their operational costs are slightly offset by Tx fees. Casual miners are likewise in the same position as casual speculators.  Not profitable?  Don't buy any more coin (turn off your rig).  
"But miners have expenses to pay, they must sell every coin or they lose money!"  Gee, thanks sherlock.  I didn't hear that explanation the previous 100 times. 
Except their expenses are essentially the same as an investor's: They convert non-bitcoin capital into bitcoin. So what if they pay their fiat to their electricity company (mining equipment seller, etc) instead of to an exchange?  Why would this compel them to sell all of it, or half of it, or any of it?  Without knowing what their current production costs are, or their lifetime cost basis, there's no reason to assume they are pressured into selling. 
How does an outsider know that any given miner is not running at a profit even by holding (by lending their coins as collateral for leverage), or are willing to take a short term loss because they think the price will improve long term if they don't sell coin (which is a positive incentive in a miner's case even more than in a speculators case, because witholding newly minted coin from ~~inflating the supply~~ circulation on the market directly influences the price to improve even better than holding existing coin)
tl;dr  miners are professional speculators, there is no economic basis to assume they liquidate all or even most of their coins immediately upon receiving them any more than a speculator must immediately sell their coins upon buying them.  Especially in a flat market. 
p.s.:   is there some straightforward way to determine from the UTXO database a running count of unspent mined coins, or does the distribution of a block reward to individual pool contributors make these coins difficult to identify?

Because that's not even close to the mainstream basis for interest in the internet during the early 1990's.  Interest in the internet in the early 1990's was driven by direct government research and investment in academic and private research at one end, and at the other, by the undeniable practical usefulness of email even on 14.4k dialup, breathless "cyberspace" writeups in Wired magazine and its precursors, and by expensive, high-end national recognition investments like [AT&amp;T's impressively precognizant You Will campaign](  
And why doesn't anyone ever seem to remember Eternal September and the landfill-crushing suffocating crapflood of free AOL trial subscription CDs role in all this.  Enormous, GDP-of-multiple-countries-scale amounts of money and resources were directed toward the building both the internet itself as well as public awareness of it.
Yeah, porn, gambling and illegal goods trade were of course contributing to growth as well. But in proportional terms they were irrelevant compared to the other factors listed above.  Their outsize impact on the media was almost entirely due to being accessible story angles that reliably generate sales. Porn, gambling, drugs, and crime are among the few loosely internet-related (and long proven ink-selling) subjects that the largely pre-internet journalists and pundits of the early 90's could talk (or rant) about to a largely pre-internet audience of the early 90's.  This is almost the opposite situation to Bitcoin, where "vice" usage supplies most of its economic growth, and the "normal" content is nearly irrelevant by comparison.  
Comparing the contribution of porn, gambling, and illegal trade to the growth of the internet in the 90's and the growth of Bitcoin in the 10's is like comparing a fart in a hurricane to a hurricane of farts.

Having been accused of being a troll in both places on multiple occasions, I think the main difference between and is not how much they support Bitcoin but the way both react to opinions that do not fit neatly into the default POV of the respective sub.  I've found that handles "off script" submissions much more objectively than here.  I don't mean blatantly confrontational attitudes, but ones that come from a position that is not quite at home in either community, but would be in a community that was a stable mixture of both. 
Alas on Reddit, we can't have nice things like this; instead we form self-segregated prison cliques, especially where ego and money are both in the mix.  
I chalk this up to the way Reddit's moderation setup invites communities to self-censor through downvotes, and as a corollary, the ease of creating spinoff subreddits where the marginalized dissenters go to avoid such censorship, leaving the original community even more reactionary and inward-facing than before.  
Tired of having your efforts to articulate a contrary position wasted by -6 Curse Of Invisibility (even if it was an OP comment, not yours, that collapsed the entire thread)? Go make your own subreddit and take all your unwelcome friends with you.  It's like a reverse osmosis filter for opinions. 
The only situation this can lead is to a sprawl of blinkered echo chambers, each distinguished by ever-higher levels of canonical dogmatism enforced by local posses of religious police.
This could be addressed to some degree by balancing the relative power of upvotes and downvotes more evenly, such as changing the minimum default post/thread visibility threshold from -5 to -10.  I think Reddit's admins are well aware of this dynamic and continue to enable it because the desire to see energy one spends on building up and defending one's "tribe" being paid off (in karma, even if nothing else) is a powerful dependency-forming stimulant.

I'm afraid I can't cite any single source for this, but if you can be specific about what it is you don't follow I can try to explain more specifically here.  Generally speaking I am pointing out that there is a minimum guaranteed propagation delay for any message on a global network. Since bitcoin is it's own trust root, it can only guarantee consistent state representation of  in an interval equal to or greater than the minimum time it takes for any single statefully significant message to close, that is, traverse the distance between the most eccentric vertexes, on its graph. This works out to a state update interval rate of 7.5 tx/sec of that graph is wrapped around the surface of the earth.

Consider taking some time away from Bitcoin to clear your head and get rid of the knee jerk fight or flight response you seem to have conditioned yourself into invoking in response to conflicting opinions.  
The question of whether people can be persuaded that decentralization is "worth the cost" is one that will make sense to people who aren't steeped in emotional attachment to Bitcoin on ideological grounds.  Which is, basically, the rest of the world outside this community.   
You should try talking to people who aren't ideologically invested in Bitcoin or decentralization as if it were a fundamental good, and who thus see the cost of securing a completely trustless decentralized network - even if it is"cheaper" than banks in some cherry picked comparison scenario - as a wasteful use of resources.  
It's possible to understand and even appreciate how Bitcoin works while disagreeing about the relative significance of the priorities that are implicit in its design.

I am establishing what the best guaranteed performance of the network would be, and that has consequent limitations on the cost/performance envelope of its scalability.  
In fact, on the subject of the block size I am actually more in favor of it (I think it is a pragmatic, if not not a perfect solution) than otherwise. That said, it has fuck all to do with what I am pointing out in the post you linked, misleading title notwithstanding.

I doubt they are planning to bolt mining chips into toasters, or even heaters, even though this seems like a place Bitcoin itself could evolve to in one of the possible futures that present conditions could be extrapolated to fit.  It's the kind of thing that is plausible if you don't expect your target audience to think about it too closely, and if they do it will give your project and your brand a ton of free mental real estate as they argue with each other about how feasible it is or is not.  
That's why I personally think this is a classic Silicon Valley red herring story to obfuscate and misdirect competitive investigation into the nature of their real plans, which will end up being loosely related to the theme of the cover story but very different (and much more nuanced) in practice.

That is a good question.  On Reddit, minority views get censored by downvotes from the majority, driving them into invisibility once the "enemies" have been identified and are automatically attacked every time they make a comment.  
The only way to continue having a conversation is to shard the discussion by making your own subreddit, and of course the equal an opposite attitude prevails there, with the result that both the old sub and the new one are far more of a polarized monoculture than the original one was.  
On here,  the "opposing" sub is and you will get a different take there than here for sure. However that sub is not so much anti-bitcoin as it is anti which is an important distinction, and people there tend to be more objective than here (with  few extreme exceptions).  but I honestly don't know of a better place than the dev mailing list and github for staying abreast of the most important issues.  
Twitter, amazingly, can be a better place than here sometimes, if you are flexible in whom you pick whom to follow.  Also somewhat contrary to what I said above, in some very rare special cases there are good IRC channels to lurk in, though they tend to be extremely biased as well.  But the quality of discussion is better managed in some of them because of the immediacy of /kickban moderation.

Others here have that one pretty well covered :D   isn't so much a Bitcoin thing as a Reddit thing.  It's how the system has been designed to deal with conflict - by actively encouraging factionalization and being OK with the echo chambers created as a result.   It means more legwork to get an objective out of the system.
I have never asked a question on the Dev list, I am just a mere lurker.

@_date: 2015-07-24 07:12:38
What you are proposing can be done, I believe, but Bitcoin would have to evolve a means to extend and rescind persistent trust to self-selected entities or groups, in order that these trusted entities could form ad-hoc zones of local autonomy, self-policing consensus within their zone, and thereby removing the burden of consensus-making within their zone from the rest of the network, with periodic checkpoint settlements of the balance for the entire zone's internal Tx history with the rest of the network.  The rest of the network should have the ability to audit any such zone on demand, though this would cost the auditing client a fee proportional to the bloat the audit would encumber the rest of the network with.  
Obviously we're way outside the scope of the globally trustless one-tx-at-a-time-verified-by-everyone approach we have right now, so this would be a development that would make Bitcoin into something few would recognize as "bitcoin" today.

Never existed.  maintaining a global state is expensive and ultimately constrained by limitations of physics even if incentives are optimally aligned and Moore's Law continues indefinitely.  
Bubbles, mining subsidies and race to bottom in resource cost cutting, on a sandbox scale ecosystem, are factors that have until relatively recently, merely concealed the reality that propagating global state in a fully redundant decentralized network is going to entail unavoidable cost/performance compromises. It's unfortunate that some otherwise bright people are having a hard time confronting this rationally.

Unless Namecoin uses some different means of initial peer discovery than Bitcoin, you will have the same conundrum getting Namecoin bootstrapped as Bitcoin under a default port blocking scenario: there's no way to find the first peer without "cheating" with a centralized mechanism such as the old IRC meet-me channel or whatever it is Bitcoin does now with DNS seeding.

Thank you, this is extremely under represented in scalability discussions.  Scalability will ultimately be constrained by the minimum  boundary defining the time required to close the global network graph. Then there is the other problem that the graph needn't be closed globally, just majoritavely.  Blocks broadcast close to latency-minimal concentrations of mining nodes have a natural advantage over those in more sparsely connected regions.

You have to point to a canonical hostname,  I don't think an IP will ~~work~~ be standards-compliant.  The hostname further has to point to a real A/AAAA record too.  
But if nothing apart from Bitcoin needs to understand what is going on, some light RFC abuse won't hurt. You could stick an IP where the hostname is supposed to go.  Or just stick it all in a TXT record instead, you can put whatever the heck you want in those.  SRV is just the Right Way to associate ports with their respective service hosts.
There's also HIP (Host Identification Protocol). Services located and identified by cryptographic keys rather than named hosts or IPs or ports, exchanged over a new namespace layer which lives in a DHT (like Bamboo), DNS-to-HIP onramp done through special HIP record type in DNS (or local config bootstrap file) and a couple daemons.  
It's a much more "Bitcoin-ish" approach to peer lookup but a bit of an undercooked hairball presently, however it's just recently been given [official RFCs](  so it's finally made it to the standards track.

TweetDeck makes this a little less painful, but basically agree.   
Reddit already suffers from a peculiar format-inspired pressure to go for the slam-dunk on one's argument in maybe 3 posts or less, and the "reward" of karma (or punishment of censorship) combined with the short shelf life of active posts discourages considered and open-ended discussion.

The problem with citing daily Tx rate changes is that it doesn't have to be faked completely - just enough to push it up marginally over whatever the real base rate is - to serve the purpose of showing prospective VCs and other investors that bitcoin is "growing" just enough to cover the costs of goosing it.  
Miners (either when seeing direct investment or through proxy in other companies they have a stake in) are in an excellent position to do this since Tx fees are already an insignificant revenue stream, so "donating" some of this by including needless Tx they themselves generate (and thus forfeit the profit form legitimate Tx) is a plausible and rational strategy that serves their self interest.

The only thing you are correct about is that taxes aren't voluntary, and if Bitcoin took over the world, its own tax system of Tx fees wouldn't be voluntary either.   Technically taxes are voluntary under specific circumstances, for example, if you want to immigrate to a different country one of the things you have to agree to do is pay its taxes.  If you think the taxes aren't fair for the basket of services you get, then you don't immigrate.

All true, DPI is wire speed only for somewhat narrow definitions of that term. But it needn't be always on, on all connections - only pointed at those which match a 'red flag' state or traffic profile and warrant a closer look. Bitcoin's network behavior, as you noted, has a pretty distinct fingerprint. 


This is a great anecdote, and I don't doubt it's true and possibly indicative of interesting trends building just under radar.  But I think it would be very optimistic to act on the belief that all such trends will end up working in Bitcoin's favor. It's worth considering what to do if, on average, they do not.


On that note, I am closely following the timely (more like long overdue) devlist discussion between Peter R, Daniele, bluematt, etc.  regarding (in my own summary interpretation) the need to develop a complete network model for Bitcoin that can discover all emergent natural dynamic limits and parametric families which inform the maximal scope of the Bitcoin system's "attractiveness" (or at least the significant component term of "attractiveness" called "utility").  The problem with making this model seems to stem from fundamental differences of opinion on exactly what constitutes the minimum definition of "attractiveness" necessary for "success," which is itself a nebulous concept. 
It seems like much of the discussion takes contorted pains to talk around this issue; as if everyone involved believes they all generally agree on these fundamental terms - yet nobody defines them to the satisfaction of everyone else - and consequently try to hold what is in fact a broad existential discussion in the extremely confined space of an implementation disagreement. 
Under these conditions the Bitcoin roadmap amounts to "whatever direction we can all agree (or be convinced/coerced by forces of superior influence to agree) to pave the next 10 meters ahead."

If you think ChangeTip is bad, OneCoin is much worse.

While the former could arguably be construed as an astroturf campaign tool for BitCoin with dubious real world functionality, the latter is an outright confidence trick with zero attempt at a plausible use case and a sales pitch that goes directly for the jugular of a gullible mark.

None of this stuff is going to happen on any apocalyptic scale, not without a correspondingly dramatic disruption in the fundamental wiring of human nature that serves as the foundation of civilization, something that dramatically changes humanity's natural-born periodic table of incentives and constraints (i.e. if we can rapidly change what it means to be human through a quantum leap in genetic engineering, strong AI, or some other transhuman development)  
 If you were around (and a working adult) before the internet went mainstream you would know that life before the internet "changed everything" is not drastically different in any qualitative sense than it is now.  Yeah, people connect more fluidly and their social spheres have enlarged in some ways, and a few rice bowls were broken but they were supplanted by others. But there's no seething masses of "left behinds" who "didn't get it" and are wailing in lament because they weren't BIG THINKERS and are now paying some sort of moral price for ignoring the internet.  Nope.  Everyone who was here then is still here now, still more or less exactly the same soup of good and bad agendas, just on different street corners and corner offices. 
The Bitcoin revolution (or whatever it may be called if it is not Bitcoin specifically that causes it) will be the same. It is still a figment of human behavior, and that changes very slowly and imperceptibly. The same fundamental human interactions, motivations, and incentives are the core of civilization, technology is scaffolding.  That's why the same people are always in charge after every major societal disruption.  Or more exactly, the same *kinds* of people.  
What does change, a little less slowly than human behavior itself but by no means overnight, is the particular set of shared priorities we have as a species. Maybe Bitcoin and its kin can introduce some new talking points into the global consensus dialogue and if by so doing it expands our set of basic assumptions about self-governance, decentralization, and post-state models for civilization that may be its most lasting "disruptive" effect. But people themselves will still take generations to catch up to and internalize these ideas, if ever.  World-changing technologies (such as democracy), which were introduced centuries, if not millennia ago *still* don't enjoy global acceptance.

They got an expensive lesson, and are now out of the crypto currency demographic pool indefinitely. Rather than sneering, the Bitcoin crowd would be wise to think about what this interest signifies: that there are many people casually probing around the edges of the virtual currency world who nonetheless cannot find a way in without being shown, and are willing to pay for a shortcut if one is presented in a confidence-inspiring package. 
OneCoin exists because it (pretends to) fill a niche BitCoin does not: The main appeal of OneCoin is that the representative who finds their mark presents themselves as a personal investment guide to show them the ropes and this 'education' is part of what they think they are paying for. Since they have no idea what this knowledge is supposed to cost it's all a matter of how good the shill is at convincing them of its value. The shill, if they are new to the scheme themselves,  may not yet even be aware that they are perpetuating a con.


You should consider that people often will have friends who come from very different demographics, age groups, and different perspectives than themselves.  Not everyone is internet savvy enough (or comfortable with a major global language enough) to do thorough research with it, many rely on personal social networks to discover, evaluate and navigate among potential opportunities and as a result are occasionally misled by someone who has become a bad apple within their meatspace web of trust, which was the major contributing factor here. 
Greed is also factor, but it's far from the only one in play and it's lazy and self-serving to superficially reduce people's motivations to "greed" or "not greed". You cannot fault people from trying to get in on what they think is the ground floor of something big.

I wonder if anyone in Bitcoin has ever thought about how this pure decentralized system has no counterpart in nature?  None.  
Energy loss, signal propagation limits, information entropy,  nature itself abhors decentralization (of the Bitcoin sort) and will tend to centralize due to self-signalling feedback effects, or lose signal integrity due to entropy.  Consensus, when confronted with the hard limits of signalling in the medium it is sustained, must specialize by losing least significant inputs or decompose into fragments.
Bitcoin cannot scale while remaining fully decentralized unless the criteria for "decentralization" are loosened (which, abstractly, is what larger blocks and overlay/sidechains both do).

The farther message travels from its origin, the less it can carry with it on the trip.  Messages thus get compressed into extremes in order to compensate for the need to demand fewer resources of lesser-interested carriers, yet remain distinct enough to not get lost in the crowd of other messages. This tends to narrow them down to binary simplicity at the wavefront.

Ideas can survive the destruction of the vessels that carry them; in some cases it may even make them stronger by freeing them from constraints. 
This is definitely, and perhaps uniquely true for Bitcoin.
The question is, how much of Bitcoin's perceived value is vested in "Bitcoin-the-idea" vs. "Bitcoin-the-thing?"
@_date: 2015-10-12 08:12:28
On several fronts it is being forced.  
First, if widely implemented (which it will be, for though it requires informed voluntary action to do now, it will require informed voluntary action to *undo* later) it will have the the effect of suppressing the agency of those who wish to "spam" the network. In this regard it is forcing them to change tactics or cease such activities altogether.  This is ostensibly desirable for the network as a whole but that doesn't diminish the fact that it is an attempt to force behavioral change on certain users of it. That isn't an incidental side effect, it is the entire point of making the decision.
Second, it means a lot of people, in order to stay current with the de facto reference client (which we're not really supposed to have, but hey, we all agree decentralization is a nice idea, and a nice idea is good enough right?) will be forced to update their proprietary implementations, which is an imposition that is not zero-cost for them. 
Third, it means that in a sense, the spammers have won, because they forced the central Core team to effectively raise the minimum cost to issue a Tx for everyone.  
Lots of people are being forced into reacting to this decision.

1. You asked for a location, not a phone number, so you don't have the right to accuse anyone scamming based on their not giving information *you didn't actually ask for*.  Even if you did, good luck finding any exchange with a live customer support telephone line. That would be impossible to pay for unless it was only implemented for user accounts with a high minimum level of trade activity and people would scream "scam" about that as well.

Subatomic particles do not make decisions about how to behave in their "self interest", so this analogy has limited relationship to decentralization (of the Bitcoin sort).  You will notice that the last time the universe was a sea of identical particles it lasted only a few moments before these began to centralize due to those very same local conditions.  
You really are proving my point though. An atom is nothing if not a perfect example of natural tendency to form centralized structure.
@_date: 2015-10-08 19:24:24
No, it cannot.  You will either give up least significant inputs (dropping unique nodes that cannot cope with larger block size, forcing them to delegate consensus to larger nodes) or fragment consensus into domains (sidechains, overlay networks, arteries, federations).

Bitcoin's rate of growth from formation to peak isn't really that remarkable.  All shares of ownership in anything that grows, undergo the same phenomenon. The difference is that it was possible for a total stranger to get in extremely early on Bitcoin if they happened to be in the right place at the right time. 
Likewise if it were somehow possible for some random clown named Fucko to buy a share in AAPL from the day that Jobs and Wozniak first jotted down ideas for the Apple I, that share (like those of almost every other company given the same circumstances) would also have had astronomical growth percentages every bit as amazing as Bitcoin.  
This does not mean that AAPL, nor Bitcoin, nor anything else has any particular reason to experience the same scale of growth. Drawing a line from par value to ATH makes any investment look good.

There seems to be a theme among some Bitcoiners that its cost is somehow intimidating to "the masses" and that's why they aren't buying it; almost as if Bitcoin is a luxury item or a prestige symbol. 
Not once in almost 3 years of hearing the topic of Bitcoin come up, have I ever heard someone cite the cost as being "too expensive".  This has nothing to do with being loaded or broke, it's just a question that makes no sense to ask until you have a satisfactory answer to the one they actually do ask, which is "what is it useful for?"

From Investopedia:




Emphasis mine.  is labeling this cache of coins as stolen property. Labels are used to distinguish things from other things, creating or signalling a difference in their value. 
Further, in the context used, it's a morally charged label applied in an attempt to taint the appeal of acquiring this particular set of coins.  
Even though this remark will not stop the coins from being sold, it may stop some people from bidding, or at least from revealing themselves as bidders. 
That he thinks it necessary to make such a remark at all reveals that he does not really believe in the concept of fungibility in the absolute, only when convenient. 
If it were possible for his remark to be permanently associated with this cache of coins or with the buyer (and it is, even though it's unlikely anyone will bother with the considerable effort of doing so) then their fungibility will be compromised.

Can "scale", yes. But at the loss of decentralization. 
Lightning Network is, abstractly, a second consensus domain with the ostensible purpose to shortcut the signal propagation limits inherent to its underlying bitcoin network. It is a hierarchical system (which is perfectly natural, mind you), and thus an ideological step away from the completely flat (and sadly, thus unscalable) "pure" Bitcoin network. 
Hierarchy and specialization are unavoidable, perennial features of self-organizing complex systems. Any body of entities maintaining a shared coherent signal can only grow until their node graph becomes too big for competing signals generated within that body to completely propagate across the entire group, preventing objective evaluation of them by entities in the group. The result that each signal forms its own domain within it. Enough of this and sooner or later the consensus splits and fragments.  
Think of a giant flock of starlings in murmuration, moving in coordination until spread too far out, and subgroups (self-signalling domains) shear off to form separate patterns of flocking behavior.

Is this a yes/no condition?  How decentralized is decentralized enough to be secure? 
Bitcoin itself is only as decentralized as the number of people who use it, which is a lot less than everyone who could use it.  Yet those who use it, trust it, because they agree that the amount of decentralization it has presently is "good enough".
Remember, Bitcoin didn't always have thousands of nodes.  The nature and level of trust necessary to use a blockchain has a lot to do with being a member of the set of people who self-select as users of that blockchain to begin with. 
@_date: 2015-10-03 18:13:07
This is a great observation.   Even assuming you can trust Bitcoin enough to store and transfer the funds to the destination, it doesn't on its own alleviate the problem of ensuring the recipient is who they say they are, or that they have been known to be reliable partners in the past.   
People keep touting various web-of-trust solutions for this (and really, WoT isn't a new idea, in fact it's probably the oldest idea in human history)  but I am not sure why this helps Bitcoin specifically.  It would just as easily help the current system, but the current system has its own preferred set of trust webs, why would it switch to a new one?   Many chicken and egg problems in these situations.

This is why Bitcoin doesn't change, improve or evolve at a rate anywhere close to other technologies.  Its incentives are structured such that a consolidation spiral is inevitable. Those who benefit from this are not incentivized to fix something which, from their POV, isn't broken.  
The protocol being 'open' is a diversion.  Just because everyone knows the rules of the game and can watch it take place doesn't mean it cannot be cheated or fixed. 
The most harmful illusion about Bitcoin is the unwarranted amount of trust placed on (or encouraged to be placed on) 'the protocol' as if it is a blind, incorruptible, self-sustaining mechanism.

Shows may issue prizes denominated in actual Bitcoin but that is a another facet altogether and isn't any different than sending a check (the usual way cash prizes are awarded) from a legal and tax standpoint.

Thanks. I've run across your name in posts before, and you seem like you know your way around the subject fairly well compared to most of the people in this sub, so it's quite encouraging to have caught your notice with this idea. Bitcoin, in my view, seems to be bringing us a step closer to a world where any piece of non-random data can be assigned a traceable unit of value relative to all other pieces of data.  I hesitate to stretch this to far, but I am tempted to suggest it may be a technology not for a digital currency-backed economic system, but for a post-currency economic system.  Like, you could barter and trade all digital goods as easily as trading a digital currency, since "digital goods" and "digital currency" would be on equal footing, in terms of liquidity. If we can enter records for value-weighted digital goods transactions in a shared public ledger, wouldn't this situation obviate the need for a separate system of currency counters?

I work in network TV on game show development. Though we're a small (tiny) niche of the overall entertainment business economy, there is serious talk going on right now about developing something Bitcoin-like that can finally merge the viewing audience directly with in-show game mechanics.  Open Transactions is one of the frameworks we're examining to facilitate this.  It's a start?
@_date: 2013-12-22 05:54:34
Not as straightforward as "watch ad &gt; get money" (this model was tried in the early 2000's and never really panned out), but the net effect is that some of the cost of the promotion will reach the hands of the people being promoted to, rather than all of it going to middlemen. 
The motivation to do this has always been there, but thwarted by the discouraging expense and hassle (for all people involved) of setting up a totally separate fiat-based payment and accounting relationship to pair with the audience and advertiser relationship.  Since a Bitcoin-like system would allow for the ad and the payment to be one single flow of data. Microtransacting rewards for advertising networks are a killer app for Bitcoin; as they are something that there is a phenomenal demand for but which is impractical with the current "serve information with one system, get compensated for that information with a different system" model. The most attractive Bitcoin innovation is essentially that it can unify "something valuable" with the ability to be compensated for that value by simply exchanging the "something of thing of value" itself, without needing to perform a totally separate value transaction which must be tracked.  
tl;dr  Bitcoin technology can be applied in a such a way as to enable any piece of data (not just a 'bitcoin') to be "price tagged" with its market value. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 02:01:06
I can't reveal much due to the omnipresent NDA spectre (not to mention professional courtesy to my partners), but TV game shows have been itching to seamlessly bridge at-home play with the shows in a live or simulated live scenario. Think "Who wants to be a millionaire" but with a live internet and TV audience in addition to the studio audience.  Up to now, we mostly make do with test messaging, but text messaging is only a one-way flow of information.  People can easily participate, but they can't be rewarded for 'winning' apart from the good feels.  With a system like bitcoin, where a message and an associated exchange of value are one and the same, this changes everything.
Practically speaking, the main problem is that TV is prerecorded and broadcast at different times in different markets. This means that you can't syndicate across a national or international market without invalidating the "undisclosed" factors in the game mechanics.  But if you could give your audience some kind of credit system, and allow them to play off each other with the TV game's known outcomes being an input into the audience's game play, it would work. To effect this you need a store of value that they can exchange with each other in between and during the various air times.  
I can't go much further than that here, other than to say that the prospect of using this store of value as a means to promote advertiser brands is what is really driving this. Bitcoin (in the form of something similar to colored coins) has created conditions to grow an entirely new mechanism of marketing to an audience - and one which which, via their association with a store of value - has a vested interest in being aware of the brands promoted to them, rather than trying to avoid the promotion through ad blocking or skipping commercials etc.
