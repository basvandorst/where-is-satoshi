Hmm okay. Coinbase wasn't a problem for me either but on GDAX it doesn't work at all. It always says there it takes 3-5mins but its been days now

How long did verification on GDAX take for you?

Yeah I actually started the verification now for 3 days in a row anew because i don't know if it's coming through to them. It's automatically restarting after some hours. Anyways, I think i will just wait. I won't get in a lot more fiat right now anyways so I won't need CB/GDAX and can just trade on binance for the moment. Thanks for your help though :)

gotta see it in percent though

I can't choose "Deposit", because my GDAX-Acount has to be verified first. So no gdax trading for me right now

I hope no one here actually believes such reasoning lol

Experts don't give accurate predictions. You just can't accurately predict a market, especially not Bitcoin. Imo experts just see when the market is moving and use such signals to ride the wave for a bit and make profits. Everything else is crystal ball magic.
