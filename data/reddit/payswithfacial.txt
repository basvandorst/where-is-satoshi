That raises another question.  Suppose a huge flaw was found in bitcoin and people were making/stealing bitcoins.  Would the price tank and everyone just move to dogecoin or something, or would the problem be fixed?  I don't know much about programming but would there be any saving it if it was some basic flaw, or is fixing things, even a core problem with it, completely the norm?

Well like px403 said there's ways around that, you don't have to take literally every step.  Many of those possibilities are impossible so can be easily eliminated.

Couldn't somebody use them, since it's a known account and not just lost?
@_date: 2014-11-12 09:03:59
I think they'd be likely to lose it or forget all about it, it's easier when someone sets it up with you.
@_date: 2014-10-31 11:33:52
Sounds simple enough!

Also take out the service charge of 1 cent, there's no service charges for bitcoin right?  I send and receive bitcoin without anything taken off the top.
@_date: 2014-11-04 10:24:29
Well I was kind of experimenting around but you're right it's a total waste of time.  The only time I go to the faucets is if I'm doing something like this and wasting time anyway.

He seems to think it's going to fizzle out when something better comes along.  Well bitcoin does have momentum going for it.  I wonder if that's true about only 200,000 people holding bitcoins.  If it is, that would have two sides too.  It means they could really go up in value.

Ah OK thank you!  I do however see that as maybe thinking inside the box.  I suspect some smart cookie will figure out how to skip some of those steps and do it don't you?  They always seem to!

Well I know every company in the world can know anything about me if they want to pay for it.  I'm saying that bitcoin, to be used as cash, should have the benefits of cash.  Just fast and totally anonymous.

The heck?
@_date: 2014-10-31 07:50:30
What does the heat of the universe thing mean?  I've heard that before but don't get!  OK, so generating the same keys must be what I'm thinking.  So it's just the length of the address that protects the key?  Because I can definitely see computers getting exponentially faster anyway in the next coming years, even without a breakthrough in technology which will come as well.

Well the fact that you got paid by microwallet is a good sign.  Mine was way over the minimum and all it ever says is you will be paid in 7 days.  More of the same I figured but maybe they will eventually get around to it.  Even if they do though that's not good enough from a business perspective.
@_date: 2014-10-31 11:04:32
Yeah that doesn't mean much to me.  Why do half the people on this forum speak in computerese.
@_date: 2014-10-31 07:19:15
The bitcoin addresses are long and complex but that's kind of a brute force way of protecting stuff, I remember when 64 bit encryption came out and the thing was "nobody will ever be able to break this."
@_date: 2014-11-05 20:14:45
Bitcoin doesn't need a foundation or anything like that, the internet regulates it.  All these companies and wallets popping up are just people trying to cash in.  Bitcoin is untracable so people use it to scam and make cash, that's what's going to be the downfall of bitcoin, no good will in the transactions.
@_date: 2014-10-30 00:25:20
Cool, this one's better than the ones I was using, they pay way more. Thanks a lot.  It says they pay within 7 days, hope that's true.  The other ones said they pay within 8 hours, but didn't pay at all.
@_date: 2014-11-04 23:50:24
When was that?  Because that's what everybody says, but I've had a big balance there for weeks.
@_date: 2014-10-31 11:19:23
Ah I see.  So I guess since the private key is what generates the addresses, if you could get any two of those addresses you could use the known formula that the bitcoin system uses to find out what the private key is?
