Nothing, but the blockchain can quite easily be copied as a sidechain. What would motivate users to invest in a new altcoin, rather than just  use the drivechain version of it? There's no reason to believe an altcoin is better than bitcoin + a copy of the altcoin.

Drivechain comes with a soft fork for blind-merged mining, which is something that allows miners to merged mine without maintaining another blockchain.

I'm not a dev, but here's some answers as I understand it.


To some extent yes. Each new sidechain needs to be soft-forked in. This ensures that sidechains do not negatively affect bitcoin's value, as miners/users will only allow chains to be added that increase their profitability. For example, it is theoretically possible to create sidechains that attack other sidechains. This is the type of thing that might be prevented from happening.


Sending funds to a sidechain from the main bitcoin chain can be done exactly like a normal bitcoin transaction on chain. Sending funds on chain from the sidechain back to the main bitcoin chain takes a few months. However, going to and from the sidechains off chain can be done instantly with lightning network and atomic swaps.


Miners don't need to run the software of any sidechains. They are asked to vote (each block has one vote) on withdrawal transactions (side-to-main) in order to allow them to go through (which happens after about 3 months of voting).


Softfork to implement drivechain in general, and technically a new soft fork for each new sidechain created.

A drivechain is essentially an altcoin with the exchange rate pegged to bitcoin. The benefit is that you get the safety of holding a bitcoin-backed currency (and not a more risky alt-currency) and benefiting from its hashrate while being able to have the features of the altcoin. Plus, you're also able to easily switch to other drivechains or the bitcoin mainchain if you decide you want those features instead without having to worry about exchange rates changing.

Drivechain uses blind merge-mining, which means miners don't need to run any sidechain nodes to merge-mine.

Lol, Sztorc agrees that BMM is pretty much pointless. But he made it to satisfy people who make the argument you're making. Miners could already be adding extension blocks to blocks in secret if they're profitable, so there's not really anything you can do about this. Not that I think it's a real problem anyway.
Miners also don't need to upgrade to being sidechain nodes when someone tries to steal - it'll be obvious that that's the case without needing to upgrade.

Anyone stuck with a completely illiquid yet absurdly overvalued cryptocurrency? This is your chance to act as an intermediary for everyone using Venezuelan government services and get rich.

It is not real.

Ummm; this is clearly fake.

This is true. When there is a profit to be made in mining, more people mine. This increases the difficulty up until cost = benefit. This also means everyone who has above average electricity prices is constantly kicked out as they become unprofitable (being replaced by more miners with cheaper electricity).
Of course if the bitcoin prices rockets up unexpectedly, all miners would earn more than anticipated and make a large profit. But if you're hoping for that you should just buy bitcoin instead.

No; you get paid in dollars probably by anyone who needs to pay the Venezuelan government. You just provide them a discount and then send them some of your crypto, then they can pay with it at the "market price" even though irl nobody would ever trade at that price. 
There's some weird tokens out there that have no volume but once upon a time someone bought a few at a very high price. Thus according to this policy the Venezuelan government would have to accept that price.

Much of the electricity supply for miners actually comes from previously shut down/underused hydroelectric power plants. Also, the energy is not wasted anyway as it provides security.
