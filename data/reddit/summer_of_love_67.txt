The intrinsic value of bitcoin is Freedom. All other alts are just imitators of this value while not actually possessing it. The Freedom value is secured and protected in Bitcoin’s Blockchain. Bitcoin’s price is a wave function representing global anxiety. What price do you put on Freedom?  We can only hope we aren’t in a country that has to put the Freedom contained in Bitcoin to test. But knowing it’s there let’s me sleep at night. Peace.

all the fork wars and attacks on it the past 9 years including the current shitcash one where bcash is stealing its hash power.
The US economy was in the tank from 2007 - 2014.  It is why we had QE quantitative easing by the FED where they printed money as fast as they could to keep interest rates artificially low so our economy hopefully would avoid a depression.  and it worked but now we have QT which is quantitative tapering and it is not known what will happen.  This is why the bond market tanked and is now entering a bear market while stocks still roar ahead. this is why bitcoin becomes more important than ever as a store of value.

Warren has a simple rule: don’t invest in anything I don’t understand. He is BF with Gates since 1980s but never invested in MS because he doesn’t understand technology. He just bought Apple because he thinks it’s a service business model now vs computers and is also a bond fund having $200 billions in cash paying interest every day. He bought ibm but sold most bad investment technologies burned him. His wisdom is valid. Financial markets guru don’t like him because he’s like New England Patriots. Sustained excellence.

What does warren buffet DJIA and Bitcoin have in common?
Warren says one thing is certain over time: the DJIA is always higher than previous decades since 1900s. It’s been thru wars and depressions and ends up higher than where it started. That’s why he buys stocks. Me too. 
Bitcoin has been through wars and recessions and ends up higher than where it started. That’s why I buy bitcoin.

I like your argument.  a correction though:
Sony beta max was better technologically speaking but VHS marketing did a smart thing in licensing the technology to manufacturers rather than keep the technology in house (like sony did) for their sony brand products.
Bitcoin has marketing muscle behind it with 10 years of track record. This is why it will prevail. I like your format analogy.

the issue is crypto presented a way to make money without the IRS having visibilty as to how much you made.  The IRS found only 800 tax returns had coins in them which is less than the 14,000 accounts that coinbase said had bought and sold Bitcoin.
Hence, the IRS went to Coinbase and asked for all your detailed info including your darknet purchases, (ha got ya. just joking) of US based Coinbase customers. To which CB said no. 
Not to be denied, the IRS went to court and won. Coinbase has to provide the info on annual transactions over $20,000 for each year from 2013 - 2015.  The real reason: this is the time frame where the megabitcoin millionaires stemmed from and the 15% tax on the profit will earn the IRS quite a bit of praise as Trump dislikes the IRS and wants their budget cut.

probably value at time of transaction.  $600 and less transactions need not be reported. Property loss is only $3,000 max.  I assume most here are capital asset, not counting bitcoin to bitcoin merchant transactions. Here is the IRS  brief summary:
The notice provides that virtual currency is treated as property for U.S. federal tax purposes.  General tax principles that apply to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency.  Among other things, this means that:
Wages paid to employees using virtual currency are taxable to the employee, must be reported by an employer on a Form W-2, and are subject to federal income tax withholding and payroll taxes.
Payments using virtual currency made to independent contractors and other service providers are taxable and self-employment tax rules generally apply.  Normally, payers must issue Form 1099.
The character of gain or loss from the sale or exchange of virtual currency depends on whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer.
A payment made using virtual currency is subject to information reporting to the same extent as any other payment made in property. 
Further details, including a set of 16 questions and answers, are in Notice 2014-21, posted today on IRS.gov.

It adds confusion to the market place. If I am an early pragmatist and go to bitcoin.com why am I on a site that is anti bitcoin. Why is bcash leader promoting the death of bitcoin in six months. Why do the symbols look identical
Nothing good comes from copying a Blockchain for personal wealth accumulation. Nothing good comes from sharing hash power 
Every bcash purchased lessens the value of bitcoin. For what purpose?  Bcash is a better name for this shitcoin. Avoid it at all costs as it fosters deceit with its short term solution. I have yet to see a bcash accepted here sticker anywhere

the most important point is that the SEC is telling us that:
**"It has been asserted that cryptocurrencies are not securities and that the offer and sale of cryptocurrencies are beyond the SEC’s jurisdiction."**
They have no say at this time! The question is, who does? And his next sentence suggests political jockeying is going on as to who does regulate bitcoin in the US. Read between the lines!
To cover his ass, or to better his political chance to have SEC gain control over crypto's he is issuing this statement. Smart political move.
ICO's are different because they involve raising money which is always under the SEC's jurisdiction. Thank god, becasue i have some ICO's that as soon as you give them your money, the founders can split with it.
But once an ICO is legally funded and produces a cryptocoin, the coin is not under the SEC's rule.
I posted this on r/bitcoinmarkets and should have cross posted it here but forgot. so instead I dup'd it.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:47:49
Have you read it?  How could you miss the definition.  "virtual currency is treated as property." i read the IRS documents and it says it is a property not a currency.  property like stocks, bonds, art, etc.  with gains and loses (can't exceed $3,000 a year for loses)
"And is says virtial currency is not treated as currency"
you will be liable for back taxes and interest.  Better see an accountant dude cause you don't know what ur talking about.

@_date: 2017-12-13 00:09:23
i disagree.  definition: state a fact or belief confidently and forcefully
asserted means someone told the SEC not your turf and he's relaying that.  It's the little nuances that are important in statements like this.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:43:50
i agree with that as I expect most people buy things under $600 which does not have to be reported or they sell bitcoin strictly for profit/loss and should be reported.  It would be interesting to know how many people pay people with bitcoin.  Probably a small number. but in paying people its better to be classified as a currency use than property.  
But the only thing i can't agree or disagree with is the currency issue.  seems the IRS is not clear. The words in quotes I took right from the IRS site contradict what you took from their site.  This could be why in some forums I am hearing that the IRS needs further clarification because their statements are not clear.
Anyway, I haven't sold any for capital gains only used it purchase stuff under $600.  And if coinbase never acknowledges my wire transfers I am never going to have any more capital gains.

my wife would have been furious with me for not telling her and no amount of money would change that.  This alone could trigger divorce, mistrust.  Also, in the US setting up a swiss account will get you in trouble for it will show you deliberately tried to hide money and the judge may give it all to her.  If you did it before marriage that would be ok.  And sudden wealth can be disastrous like posters have been saying.  Best friends 45yr old brother won a $10mil scratch ticket ($500k/20yrs) sold the future streams and 4 years later is bankrupt, divorced, living in car. No one understands how this happened.

This sub and everyone's contributions have been very helpful. Not only have I bought BTC now, but I defend it constantly in the Wall street journal &amp; Barron's comments area.  If it hadn't been for this sub, i wouldn't have been able to sound like I knew what I was talking about to beat back the Tulip ANALogy lovers and the coin of criminals.  It is still scary to ask noob "dumb" questions because you guys/gals are so into it that you forget educating beyond your club is critical for that is how you grow bitcoin (without software), for the masses and me.  It's not easy to learn the ins and outs of crypto and I'm not computer illiterate at all but I'm not a programmer either. So thanks to all for educating us.
