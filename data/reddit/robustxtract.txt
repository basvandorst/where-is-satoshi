Hey, don't worry about it, dogecoin and bitcoin are together! 
@_date: 2014-05-29 20:56:16
I like that statement, that is a nice statement +20 doge

Now that I look back, i'm not to sure either. I think I first heard it actually on the radio, something about an online currency. Then I saw a coin being made of the doge meme on the front page. I think I had a general idea of what a bitcoin was, but dogecoin appeared to me as "money you can make on your computer". After a while i realized it was so much more then that. Then eventually I further understood what a bitcoin was

Oh cool! Thanks stcalvert! Bitcoin is already a friendly community to me!
@_date: 2014-06-17 05:52:08
This looks like a great site to use! What kind of stuff do you sell?
@_date: 2014-05-29 10:35:31
Well, I mean, one of the big things Dogecoin has is the community. I personally agree that the price is not going to have any kind major skyrocket. whilst 1 dogecoin is virtually 0 compared to a bitcoin, the community has the power to collect up quite a few to put towards projects like the Bobsled team, the NASCAR, etc. I do think though compared to other cyrptos, dogecoin has higher publicity then quite a few of them.

Just saying it theoretically, but still thanks for that conversion, mind if I ask for a link?
@_date: 2014-05-29 21:10:45
Head on over to the sub, there's heaps of guides and people who can help you out!

Well actually when I first started out, I actually began mining on my laptop (not a great idea, i know) I actually never heard of bitcoin before joining dogecoin. I vaguely remember, but it was something on the front page which incited me to join. After mining dogecoin for a while, racking up about 300 doge, I heard of bitcoin, and never found the incentive to mine bitcoin, as I preferred having 300 doge, compared to 0.00000001 BTC (just an estimate)

May i have some bits?
@_date: 2014-05-29 20:58:19
Much thank, such nice. :) 
@_date: 2014-05-29 11:06:50
I completely understand your point of view. I do agree that many dogecoin people do not own much or do not contribute to donation appeals. However I do believe that you shouldn't talk about Dogecoin in such a negative way. It is just another coin in the community. You already are apart of the biggest crypto by far, you shouldn't have to bag out other crypto currencies. Anyway you did make some good points about Doge and Bitcoin, so take this +25 doge

Awoken in a cloud of smoke and dust, Satoshi Nakamoto wearily rose to his feet from the cold floor where he landed. Looking across the room, there was not much that remained. He thought all was lost. Destroyed. His work all gone. Until... 
Through the haze of the smoky cloud which filled his room was a single pinprick light. Nothing definitive. But when he stumbled towards it, it grew bigger, and  brighter. The pinprick grew intensively to which the time he reached it, he saw its true potential. 
His computer was the only thing which remained after the calamity. He drastically attempted to readjust his eyes to see the screen but it was no use, the explosion had rendered his eyes useless. Using his knowledge of basic keyboard commands, he turned on text to voice, and even Bill Gates himself could not even begin to contemplate what it would say 
*Bitcoin created, would you like to publish? *... He had done it. His computer was borderline destroyed by the work which is had done to create the coin. The smoke and dust left In the air reminders of the sacrifice Satoshi had made, risking his computer to create bitcoin. 
With a smile on his face, he pressed enter, and with bitcoin published, the world was changed forever.
