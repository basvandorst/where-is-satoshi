Sorry, I didn't proof read.
@_date: 2014-02-04 14:48:55
I do. But what you said made it sound like doge has been around for a while/btc ASICs haven't been around for long. I realized it was too late to get into BTC when the first generation of ASICs came out, and that was a while ago.

I don't know what your problem is; Bitcoin is a fucking genius name for it.

Spot on!

I wasn't being sarcastic :I
@_date: 2014-03-20 13:55:02
Yup, so I tipped him 100 doge
@_date: 2014-04-27 06:07:36
I deserve this
@_date: 2014-03-20 12:16:28
I never said I was speaking for the dogecoin community, I said that I was speaking for myself.

You realize dogecoin has only been around since December, right?
@_date: 2014-04-27 02:40:09
Yeah. I rarely watch actual TV anymore (it's all about Netflix for me), but I was watching a movie on FX and saw it and got the biggest grin ever.
@_date: 2014-02-04 15:53:57
Oh true.
@_date: 2014-04-09 19:54:00
You emphasized the wrong word. Sorry for being a grammar Nazi...
@_date: 2014-06-10 16:51:41
I did not! 
@_date: 2014-03-20 12:11:03
You'd think they would know how much they have in their wallets. I've only tipped one person, and that was because they spent like two hours helping me get my AMD card and nvidia card running in the same rig.
@_date: 2014-06-10 21:51:52
People put up signs like this all the time around here
@_date: 2014-03-19 20:12:00
No, fork. The 1.6 fork. It was also a halvening, but it was still a fork.
@_date: 2014-03-19 20:19:52
I just want to personally say sorry, as someone invested in dogecoin, for all the tipping and stuff in this sub; I feel that it is getting out of hand. Shibes don't understand that the bitcoin community doesn't exactly like the dogecoin community.
I for one don't like the lack of seriousness that the dogecoiners have. Granted, the currency was never supposed to be serious, but it could have easily been taken seriously and turned into the dollar bills of cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2014-06-10 16:25:56
I didn't do this...
@_date: 2014-04-10 02:38:13
Why would you name something that is directly related to technology and money something NOT related to technology and money?

I never said anything about the health of the coin, I was just saying that the guy wasn't wrong in saying fork.
@_date: 2014-03-21 02:31:04
So you asked a thousand people?
