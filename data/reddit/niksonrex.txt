But like i said i dont think ill do it daily just because i love my gpu.
@_date: 2018-05-18 01:04:56
Im legit using this to earn like $10 to buy a game. Im not a miner lol. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 01:05:47
I didnt know what to call it other than mining. And like i said im a gamer and the pc does nothing during he night so why the heck not.
@_date: 2018-05-18 01:20:13
?? Thats not an answer to my question. If ur suggesting im not making shit, like i said i dont care. Im fking 15.

You are completley right. I agree with you. Im making more money than id be making while playing a game so yea xD. But like i said imma do it once a week i guess cause i just wanna make cheap change to buy a game or for a microtransaction in wot or wt. Thank you for replying.

Burning it up at 60°C fells kinda impossble. I understand if its at 80°C but 60. It gets much hotter when im gaming.

So you mean the room should be cool too? I think i got it covered. I also gathered 2 friends with gtx1050s and one with a radeon 200 series to mine with me. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 08:35:41
Thank you i will xD.
@_date: 2018-05-18 08:34:20
Lol ok.
@_date: 2018-05-18 08:37:54
Oh so im speaking with a professional. Alright, alright.
@_date: 2018-05-18 01:10:46
Dunno what im mining. The nicehash miner just turns everything into bitcoins. Im not actually planning to build a mining farm or even a single pc just for that. Im 15 and if i could make my dad money to buy me a game with my pc id be damned. All i wanted to know how long the gpu will live. Also tell me what subreddit should i use cause if its of topic imma be gone.
