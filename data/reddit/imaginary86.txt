I'm talking here as a normal user, not an expert on the topic in any way, but as far as I understand,  Luno has the keys.
Regarding double spend, from another thread,  I understood that it's quite expensive to exploit double spends and thus "safe" for small transactions like you expect at a retail store.

Compatibility with existing hardware :-)
No additional capital outlay required for the trial and no awkward bending over the cashier to try and scan code on their screen.
But I agree, for bigger rollout printing the QR is silly.

I can't remember where, but I read that the costs of exploiting BIP70 to double spend is very high and doesn't make sense for the amounts transacted at grocery store, so it is thus 'safe'. Can someone confirm this?

I bought stuff yesterday using Bitcoin. Fees amounted to ZAR 1.20 (less than 0.08 USD)

Our country isn't corrupt, but we certainly have a few corrupt people in power. Our _government_ however, was one of the first to publish an official position paper on Bitcoin making it very clear what their view is on virtual currencies (they accept that it has potential to disrupt the status quo and that they can't monitor any money entering/leaving the country through Bitcoin,  so for now, they only observe).

I'm still here. And I get to travel for work, so I frequently get to compare what we've got here with rest of the world. So far, none really compare to South Africa. Maybe Malaysia in terms of food and cultural diversity and environment. But the humidity is a bit too much XD

It's the Luno app (South Africa's biggest Bitcoin exchange), they're also the backend, so in the case of the the demo it's Luno to Luno address.

Yep, it's a trial. Though mobile/alternative payment systems are spreading like wildfire here. At Pick 'n Pay I can already just tap my phone and go at checkout as FNB's (my bank) Android app supports NFC 'tap and pay'.
Edit: point is I'm hopeful this will be rolled out.

I suspect most businesses that just want to go on with business will have a similar stance. However, with all these "smaller" businesses playing wait and see the pressure is again back on the large "reputable" exchanges.
Edit: I'm just glad that as a "normal" person I can keep my few satoshi's with Luno and whatever happens I'll still be able to make most of my online purchases using Bitcoin.

Genuine question intended for promoting discussion, besides potentially getting rich quick and sending money abroad: What makes Bitcoin better than a R5 a month bank account with a chip and pin MasterCard/VISA card that can be used to spend anywhere in the world?

I just double checked. No fees only apply if you send to e-mail address or cellphone number. So not sure how how they implemented it for Pick 'n Pay

I don't think in this case there'll be any transaction fees if you use the Luno app. Luno is South Africa's biggest Bitcoin Exchange and they've got 0 fees for sending from one Luno user to another. But I plan on going there to do my weekly shopping tomorrow,  so will update with my experience :-)

Another South African here. There's lots of amazing stuff happening here. I'm also passionate about the social benefit aspect of bitcoins. But I'm also realistic about the current state of Bitcoin.
My feeling is that with the current insane growth the perception is that it's a get rich quick scheme and I fear that people who can't afford to loose their savings will most likely be the ones who end up loosing their savings.

Hehe, timezone's hey. I was up untill 3:00 in the morning and then decided I probably need some sleep if I was going to make it to the office today.
@_date: 2018-04-19 00:22:39
Awesome, thanks! Will keep on trying :-)

Hi, amazing game! Though I'm stuck on level 85. Can you confirm wether it is possible? It feels like I've brute forced every possible combination of moves..
