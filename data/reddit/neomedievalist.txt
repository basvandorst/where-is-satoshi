A) Bitcoin cannot be a viable alternative to fiat if the total market cap is too low. there needs to be enough liquidity to make a currency viable.
B) Wanting something to become a currency (medium of exchange) is not mutual exclusive or in conflict with viewing something as a speculative investment. The first reason for this is that there are transitional stages. Bitcoin may become a currency and become stable, but in the mean-time there is speculation potential. Secondly, the economic reasoning underpinning Bitcoin is that medium of exchange and store of value are not mutually exclusive. Hence the supply cap and method of distribution (and Genesis Block message!).

Libertarians (in the american sense) and classical liberals are still "left-wing" from the perspective of reactionaries and from the standpoint of history. It's only in the last two centuries that somehow ideas which are radical breaks from tradition and authority are somehow considered "radically" right. Just shows how deep into insanity we've plunged.
All these views are materialistic and individualist where the economic role of humanity is seen as the fundamental role and society is at root a conflict. This is opposed to the pre-modern view, which existed prior to the past few centuries, that is traditionalist, authoritarian (respectful of authority), communitarian (in a hierarchical sense, not in an egalitarian one), and sees society as kinship based on rituals wherein the economic man is an inferior role.
All of modernity is left-wing.

The deflationary spiral is a) misplaced because it's an argument which assumes the current financial regime, but changes one variable  (price deflation) and then concludes that this causes issues (it would) and b) it is otherwise a slippery slope fallacy that ignores the continually rising consumption floor of people over the long-term and also ignores the mechanism by which savings to spending ratio is self-correcting.
Governments want to to keep their ability to manipulate the money supply. That's how they pay for shit they can't otherwise through taxation. It has nothing to do with economic theory, it's all just a way to work-around taxation. Devaluing the coinage is not a new tool in the tool box for empires starved of funds.

Saving money isn't hoarding indefinitely. It's a rejection of the current array of spending opportunities in favor of anticipated future opportunities. That's how economies evolve. Forcing people to illiquidate into investments and consumer goods traps the economy into systemic malinvestments. 
@_date: 2019-02-12 13:09:34


Savings aren't idle. They represent a purposeful choice by the saver. Savings are eventually spent on services and investments. Nobody saves indefinitely. The deflationary spiral is a slippery slope fallacy. Forcing the market to spend prematurely biases current investment opportunities over potential ones. That creates systemic malinvestment and bubbles.

Yawn. Deflation would discourage debt, particularly consumer debt. So your point would only be a transitory effect but not a permanent one.

People cannot save indefinitely. Not only do humans have a baseline of consumption to survive (food, shelter, etc.), but they have social, status, and entertainment baselines as well. So as more and more people saved, we'd eventually reach the aggregate baseline, pass it, and the process would stop because people simply couldn't save any more.
And what are they saving for exactly? It must be *for something*. So unless they are doing it for some indefinite inter-generational wealth transfer, they are going to spend at some point and bigly. This isn't a video game where people will just save money to rack up points for a high score.
The anti-deflation myth relies on a slippery slope fallacy. In reality, there is a ceiling to the rate of savings, a floor to spending (which is always rising as civilization evolves), and a floor to investment also.

He was storing and sending them improperly and putting others at risk. Someone who leaves loaded guns around their house is also being irresponsible. Pretty much every responsible gun owner practices proper storage of firearms. What Roger did was incredibly irresponsible and shows a lack of regard for the safety of his neighbors.

"Discrimination" will be defined in a way that suits far left-wing politics. It's an inherently nebulous term that the left has already shown willingness to stretch and contort.
