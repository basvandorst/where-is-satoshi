The lightning network is the opposite of decentralization...
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:11:44
you are talking about decentralization on a bitcoin sub... just telling you that bitcoin is trying to move away from that, and centralize transactions off the chain
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:05:18
What are you saying? The Chinese know which coin is the best?
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:32:14
BCH could keep up with all of BTC's transactions in addition to its own.
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:00:38
that is not fud... anything can be done in a hard fork
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:52:56
sure, if Bitcoin traffic gets blocked, you could mail HDDs to update the blockchain... but then transactions would take a while to complete.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:19:13
just place bets for and against bitcoin.... that way, it won't matter much if it sinks.
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:07:54
if you look at the bible, the current one is referred as the bible, but it has been re-written/modified multiple times ... same could happen.

The downsides of having your Internet Service Provider decide who you can connect to on the Internet?  It basically breaks the internet as we know it...   They could decide to implement a $0.01 fee per kilobyte to download the blockchain or to watch youtube. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:24:35
litecoin had this for a while, no?
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:23:17
does he have 50% of the mining power yet?
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:06:19
Double cheers to the ones who bought using BCH while it was high.
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:30:14
nothing catastrophic yet...
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:56:52
net neutrality doesn't give any control to the government.... it just means that the ISPs have to treat all internet traffic equally.
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:51:22
The problem is that there is laws that prevent competition in this market...  It is currently a legalized monopoly in many areas.
@_date: 2017-11-23 11:54:06
Bitcoin traffic could be blocked... try to make bitcoin work without the internet.  You really underestimate the importance of net neutrality.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:40:09
so, at what point will you buy? $4500/btc?
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:52:38
Bitcoin already forked (in the past) ... The most popular fork is called Bitcoin, that's all.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:00:42
but this is not the worst spike ever
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:29:53
that's good news for bitcoin-cash
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:43:58
it should drop a lot after the fork...
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:43:51
Bitcoin's nodes IP addresses are basically public... you could block those and I think that this would prevent users from downloading/sharing the blockchain.  There is ways around that but they are not foolproof.
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:06:49
and without net neutrality, ISPs control the internet...
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:45:24
litecoin is like bitcoin-core, it has segwit and supports the lightning network ... it is not like bitcoin-cash ... pretty much every else that you said is also false.
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:24:43
Bitcoin could do a hard fork to change that maximum number of coins
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:45:12
doesn't do that on my computer... but I use an ad blocker and firefox...
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:24:03
they are trying to prevent people from selling to stop the crash?
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:23:06
markets are adjusting
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:14:49
sounds like bitcoin-cash
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:06:54
They would have added support for bitcoin cash if they did...
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:20:23
by the time this happens, Bitcoin will have forked so much that it will have became just like a bank...
@_date: 2017-10-06 12:25:56
If VHS did the same thing that Bitcoin has been doing, you would have to change your VHS reader once in a while to still be able to read your VHS....
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:54:52
it's a little bit like MySpace... you don't know when it's going to get replaced by something "better"
@_date: 2017-10-07 19:27:36
Just like you should always trust the binaries that BoA ask you to download at every update
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:09:26
Doesn't the miner also get something like 12 free bitcoins from the block that was mined? (in addition to transaction fees)

Bignum squaring may produce incorrect results (CVE-2014-3570)
Severity: Low
Bignum squaring (BN_sqr) may produce incorrect results on some
platforms, including x86_64. This bug occurs at random with a very
low probability, and is not known to be exploitable in any way, though
its exact impact is difficult to determine. The following has been
*) The probability of BN_sqr producing an incorrect result at random
is very low: 1/2^64 on the single affected 32-bit platform (MIPS) and
1/2^128 on affected 64-bit platforms.
*) On most platforms, RSA follows a different code path and RSA
operations are not affected at all. For the remaining platforms
(e.g. OpenSSL built without assembly support), pre-existing
countermeasures thwart bug attacks [1].
*) Static ECDH is theoretically affected: it is possible to construct
elliptic curve points that would falsely appear to be on the given
curve. However, there is no known computationally feasible way to
construct such points with low order, and so the security of static
ECDH private keys is believed to be unaffected.
*) Other routines known to be theoretically affected are modular
exponentiation, primality testing, DSA, RSA blinding, JPAKE and
SRP. No exploits are known and straightforward bug attacks fail -
either the attacker cannot control when the bug triggers, or no
private key material is involved.
This issue affects all current OpenSSL versions: 1.0.1, 1.0.0 and 0.9.8.
OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1k.
OpenSSL 1.0.0 users should upgrade to 1.0.0p.
OpenSSL 0.9.8 users should upgrade to 0.9.8zd.
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 2nd November 2014 by Pieter Wuille
(Blockstream) who also suggested an initial fix. Further analysis was
conducted by the OpenSSL development team and Adam Langley of
Google. The final fix was developed by Andy Polyakov of the OpenSSL
core team.

As per our previous announcements and our Release Strategy
( support for OpenSSL versions
1.0.0 and 0.9.8 will cease on 31st December 2015. No security updates for these
releases will be provided after that date. Users of these releases are advised
to upgrade.

details over time.
