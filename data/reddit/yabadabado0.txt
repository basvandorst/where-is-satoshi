To the moon?
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:31:46
New here. Why does every real-time chart show a slightly different price? Shouldn't everything be in sync?
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:07:38
What is wrong with calling it bcash? Honestly, do not understand..

Does anybody else have trouble seeing graphs on gdax?

Cryptonaire showing tether across the board??
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:41:12
On the far right, there is a drop-down menu with a link to helpful articles. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:31:31
Coinbase.com 
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:42:47
The app "Delta". Much better than Blockfolio. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:25:54
When was the fork exactly?
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:31:42
You might even say they have no fees?
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:16:45
Help me understand the gdax order book?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:17:12
Fuck that. Im out. Moving to Binance/ Gemini. Fuck coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:21:08
GOING DOWN WITH THE SHIP! HODL
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:46:28
The best time is now. Well, the best time is a dip. Watch gdax for a few hours. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:38:05
When trying to set a limit sell order at 1599.99 I get a post only error. Any idea what that is? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:47:25
LOL @ Ripple being up 21%. You go Ripple
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:50:23
Where can I look at charts for a specific day? For example what if I want to look at October 5th between 10am and 2pm?
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:59:25
ELI5: Stop order vs limit order? When I make a sell on gdax where does it fund? The USD account? Sorry, I was only using coinbase before this.

@_date: 2017-12-20 01:26:59
Im not mad they gave us options. Im mad they did not announce this. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:51:19
What time do Sundays futures go live?
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:53:59
ETH right now tho 
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:59:16
How long does Kraken take to verify?
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:46:50
So so close....
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:15:27
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:45:42
Don't use coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:55:52
Do you expect a large dip when all the newbies who bought with a bank account have their coins/funds released from limbo after their eight days is up?
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:29:48
Sure its possible but who knows. Its been holding fairly steady for the past 5 hours. Unless you're buying a very large amount I would say just go for it. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:24:04
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:50:10
Good luck buddy!
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:26:49
Helpful! Thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:22:28
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:13:36
Maybe I missed the fucking memo but I didn't even know bcash was coming to Coinbase today. Incredibly shitty of Coinbase if they did not announce that. I had a sell order at $15,000. Completly fucked me over. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:03:04
Why is that?
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:05:41
Confused on sell walls. Is this a good time to buy? or is it about to drop even more?
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:37:23
+1 for Delta
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:26:31
This is perfect. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:37:38
Don't invest anything you are not willing to lose. Nobody knows where this train is going.
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:57:15
What wallet will support BTC ETH LTC XRP IOTA and Bcash?
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:20:42
Yes? Watch for a few hours and buy when you feel its close to the bottom of a dip. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:19:47
Ohh the irony. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:43:50
No, I think its fucked they didn't give us a few days notice. I'm not mad about not being able to buy BCH. I think having options is a good thing. I'm mad I had very low sell orders filled unnecessarily. I am mad that they knew this would affect the market and did nothing to prepare their customers. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:45:17
Read the sidebar. I would recommend moving your coins to a wallet. The market fluctuates alot. Dont panic sell at the first sign of a dip. Hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:58:46
You don't want to become a target for hackers. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:05:01
Buy before or after the wall comes down? Or buy Sunday before futures? What time do futures go live?
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:34:07
Ill start to worry below 14k. We are fine. HODL
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:03:17
Same. Ended up buying this morning at $693. We'll see what happens. The next 48 hours will be interesting. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:36:31
God damn, what a wild ride this has been.
