Work in a coin tumbler or a truly anon crypto transaction and I would be closer to satisfied.  I have been mining since 2011.  Uncle Sam gets his twice off me.  First rewards declared as income then sold/spent declared as capital gains.

The IRS then checks the blockchain details and sees the transactions of the same funds moving between all 3 wallets...

@_date: 2018-01-19 14:33:11
Pick a coin tumbler or two.  Trade to multiple wallets or exchange to different cryptocurrency blockchains.  Either of those will result in suffering the hit of transaction fees plus risking volatile price movement for the point in time.
Or sit on them for over a year and just pay long term capital gains rates.  Low risk, low reward...sure...but slow and steady ain't so bad

Faith has nothing to do with it.  Crypto math and the proof of work are what give bitcoin value.  As long as someone is willing to pay for something it will have value.  Tell your friend that cryptocurrencies are not for him.  Build a miner and mine what is profitable.
@_date: 2017-08-19 03:16:47

$600 is alot to spend for something that has no other use and is slated to be obsolete in less than a year.  5850's can be had on ebay for 140, 7970's can be had online for 370.  (I grab mine at Microcenter with $50 extended warranty - they swap dead/dying cards with no questions asked in my experience)  
At least with the video cards they have another use and you can sell them later to recoup funds.  The low watt consumption is nice, but I'm not sure the watt consumption based savings would eclipse the hardware savings.  With BFL they have a trade up program, but the details have been sketchy.
@_date: 2012-09-23 19:58:33
You could mine litecoins on your cpu cores.  They're not worth as much, but they can be exchanged for bitcoins.  If the machine is working anyway, why not make an extra bitcoin or two every once in a while?
My hashrates are 4466 mhash/s for BTC and 200 khash/s LTC.  Started BTC mining in August, have about 73 BTC as a result.  Sold some to friends, arranged for a laser to be shipped to me, generally trying to sit on them.

This one million times this.  I build machines out of habit and have five 1155 based desktops at home.  Last month I decided to pick up a few 7970's when the price dropped to 369.  Put extended warranties on them at microcenter and have returned two already.  currently have 7 of them going in 4 machines. 3.2.2.  Through pooled mining since I've earned 48 BTC.  I intend to keep the miners running 24/7 until the difficulty drops.  At this point I'm considering myself behind as one of my pooled miners (a XFX 5850 BE) did find a block.  Steady and slow wins ... right?  My hashrate is 4.5Ghash/s at best.  This winter I'll likely sell the miners cheap to friends.  Recoup a bit of funds.  Only selling BTC to personal friends for cash in hand.  Hoping the next round of GPU's beats the ASIC/FPGA'S so I can do it all over again.  Starting in August kinda sucked thanks to fighting the heat with the A/C.  Damn the torpedoes they're mostly overclocked.  Microcenters replacement service is 50 per card but implemented as no questions asked return swap.  So many cards have the serial number stickers on the heatsinks.

Mining since 2011 and have sold cryptocurrency on Coinbase through GDAX and then transferred to savings account with zero fees.  They are fine to use.  However I would not leave any more crypto on an exchange than you can afford to lose.  This comes from being burned by Gox and BTC-E through the years.
Gemini is well recommended but they take forever to verify accounts.  I applied to Coinbase at the same time as Gemini and am still waiting for Gemini to approve...but given the choice of a low fee vs zero fee....gotta give the edge to Coinbase 
@_date: 2018-03-06 16:54:56
Which then has to be declared as income eh?  Pretty sure this would be considered mining.  Then you will need to consider capital gains.

Arguably it already has.  I used to mine with 12 7970 each pulling 450W back in 2011.  Now I mine with more modern cards which are far more efficient.

Same here, also on Slush.  Was using GPU's, now Avalon ASIC.
@_date: 2013-04-09 04:50:36
The cards have paid themselves off.  To date I've earned 234.68 BTC.  I ordered an ASIC from Avalon's 2nd batch.  Have ordered from Bitcoinstore.com four more 7950's and two celeron builds (case/psu/mobo/ram).  As the difficulty increases my hashrate is less impressive against the total network hashrate and thus my earned amount of bitcoins has fallen.  My hashrate is now 6 Ghash thanks to adding a few more cards, and will continue to increase over time.  Last month I earned 23 bitcoins, this month I expect to earn about 16.  However last months were worth less than 100, and this month... looks good so far.

Exchanges exist to provide a service and earn their Fees for thr convenience.  Any market that restricts a cryptocurrency is only limiting their ability to profit.
I have been mining since 2012.  First with CPU/GPU, then with ASIC, then back to GPU.  Over 500 BTC mined and spent, over 600 LTC mined and held, a bit of other smaller crypto coins too.  Never exchanged for fiat.  Spent online at retailers who accepted cryptocurrencies (soylent, memorydealers, newegg, bitlasers, etc.).  Now it is easier than ever to spend with purse.io facilitating Amazon purchases.

I started mining in August, have added more cards over time.  Currently using seven 7970's and two 6850's.  Hashrate is around 5Ghash/s.  Microcenter has 7950's for $319 and I'll probably pick up two of those this weekend.  Expect doing so will bring me to around 6Ghash/s.  I can't see the point in ASIC mining since they're essentially worthless once they fall behind a profitable hashrate.  At least with the GPU's I can sell them to recoup funds.  The trade up program on ASIC's doesn't interest me.  The bitcoin machines heat my place and provide noise to help me sleep better at night.

"In April last year, the FBI detected instances of an online game's virtual currency being used to purchase in-game virtual items, which were then on-sold to other players for ''clean money'', in a cycle of exchange that legitimised dirty money."

It has not been profitable yet.  I build machines out of habit, but normally stick with nVidia.  I started switching over to AMD cards to play with bitcoin mining.  Long story short, have spent roughly $3000 in hardware, electric bill about $200 higher per month for August/Sept/Oct and $100 higher per month for Nov/Dec/Jan.  That pegs costs at $3900.  I've earned 187 btc thus far which at current value is worth $3319.25.  Fortunately I know people who are willing to barter for the bitcoins and because of this something which used to cost me around $350-400 cash now costs me much less in bitcoins.  I've also spent more than a few at bitlasers.  My hashrate is a bit less than 5Ghash which results in around 24 btc per month.  Not quite profitable on paper in a way which I can easily show to others, but it's worth it IMO.  Electric bill increased by about $100 per month, earning roughly 24 btc per month.  The 7970's are paying themselves off and soon will be paying the electric bill for me.

That is a solid collection of links.  I've been mining since August.  Seven 7970's provide noise and heat for my place.  Have bought lasers, coffee, and sold plenty of bitcoins to friends for cash.  
@_date: 2013-03-09 07:57:38
I started mining in August of last year when many said it was 'too late' to bother.  What started off as a few GPU's has changed to 8 7970's, 2 7870 (Tahiti LE), and 2 6850.  I've earned enough to buy burning lasers for myself and sell to friends.  Paid for Avalon ASIC miner with bitcoins I earned.  Despite the value, I consider them to cost 4.16 each.  My electric bill is about $100 higher than 12 months ago when I wasn't mining and I earn about 24 bitcoins per month.  
Very excited about bitcoinstore.com and all the buzz on Forbes lately.  The noise of fans lulls me to sleep each night, and my place is warm and dry with the windows cracked open to let some cold air in.  I'm still recommending GPU mining, I expect there's at least a few months left before GPU's become unprofitable.
