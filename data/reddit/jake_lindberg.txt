Got banned from interac for life. Tried a shoddy story about selling goods online, RBC manager didn’t buy it. Printed off transaction and chat logs and tried again, got everything back in 2 weeks.

That’s what I do mostly. Have one with my phrases and keys locked away mostly but people are starting to know I do this too much and I don’t wanna continue without security. I also work at a place with little internet security and there’s no service so I’m at the mercy of the wifi.

Figured so. Just started there last week too.

Ahh I get it. Because green address raises the fees and rebroadcasts till it's accepted. So my transaction was accepted by 2 blocks basically, and actually could be double spent, the chain just wants to pick one to run with.
I thought this would be resolved quicker, I mean most transactions on green address take 6-24 blocks, and I'm sitting at 90 now on the funds but the output hasn't been spent on the fees yet in the chain.
So just wait it out? Last time I had to wait it took 48 hours. It's not life threatening or anything I was just curious but it makes sense.

Depends how long you wait to cash out and how you decide to report it but I have to play by the rules because I have a financial services license. I’ve never cashed out any crypto I’m just looking for someone who’s used an exchange with a bank who hasn’t ran into any locked accounts or had their account shut down and wanna know what bank and exchange they’ve used.
As far as I’m looking, I’m best off to open a business account at my bank and do it all through there.

I've logged in and out and restarted my wallet hundreds of times I originally thought the wifi security at my work site was the issue but I'm back to society with cell phone service again and it still isn't showing.

What do you mean fresh off memory

It shows it in the top corner of my Blockchain app like I have it, but when I go to send anything else it is missing from my balance. It does not show up period in my other wallet either.

Hasn't sent?

I sent from my green address wallet which raises fees till it's accepted, and that worked totally fine but when I went to send it out of Blockchain.info it gave the warning that there may be a double spend, and that wallet worked fine last time, it automatically sets the rate. There have been almost 100 confirmations on the transaction as it shows as spent but the miners fee hash has not been. I'm relatively new to crypto but I'm not retarded with this tech stuff I just get alarmed since I've just started. Just looking for an answer.
