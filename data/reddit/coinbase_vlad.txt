Hi there! Sorry to hear about the issue.
If you believe your deposit is lost, I highly recommend contacting your bank and request they run a trace on your transfer. This will enable you to locate your funds and uncover the reason for a failed credit.
If your question remains unanswered, email us at support+reddit and we'll do our best to help.

Hello and thank you for the details. Since this falls out of scope of Coinbase, I'm not sure we can help.
However, I was under the impression that unless you used BIP38 checkbox to encrypt your wallet, BitAddress only gave you pub/priv key pair.
If you believe you have NOT encrypted your wallet, then it should be possible to move the coins using Bitcoin-QT.
If that fails, it might be worth trying decryption services:
I'm sorry that we can't be of more help.
