I own a small business that is capital intensive and my community bankers are invaluable to me.  I don't see bitcoin replacing this function.
However, I agree there are a lot of improvements for efficiency.  I think bitcoin will do to banks what the Internet has done to newspapers.  They still perform some very valuable functions, but they are smaller, leaner and more efficient than they once were.  
Newspapers also got kicked completely out of some things like low value classifieds that were taken over by Craigslist/ebay and job listings that got taken over by Monster &amp; CareerBuilder.  
Similarly, who needs a personal checking account when you have a bitcoin wallet on your phone?  Who needs a savings account when you can use a hardware wallet?

I have my own brief Purse Marketplace review.  Yesterday I ordered a t-shirt from Marketplace seller "allthingsbitcoin" to try this service out.  
I had a few problems.
1.  Not sure if the fault was with Purse or my wallet software (Mycelium iOS) but I had trouble paying.  When I scanned the QR code and sent the payment it arrived, but Purse showed an error that my payment was not complete due to being short 0.00001167 BTC (less than a penny).    
2.  I thought about just ignoring the above short payment since it is less than a penny.  However, I could not communicate my t-shirt size to the seller because the buyer-seller dialog box only shows up AFTER you pay!
3.  So I sent another payment for 0.00001167 and of course the mining fee is larger than this size payment.
4.  Then the dialog box showed up so I could communicate my size to the seller.  Note that an hour has now passed since I started my checkout due to waiting on two payments before being able to communicate the size I needed.  Should be able to do this during checkout and not have to come back later to do this.
5.  Unlike Amazon or most sellers, Purse sends no email with sale or shipping confirmations.  Maybe privacy lovers prefer this, but I like email confirmations.  With Purse, one must log into their Purse account to see status updates from the seller.  It would be nice if there were a feature to turn email notifications on/off.  This way privacy nuts can get less email, but normal buyers can receive email notifications from the seller.
6.  Also, I could not find any means of contacting the seller BEFORE buying to get questions answered, which I think is odd/lacking.
Overall, I am happy to see this Marketplace service available as another option to bitcoiners.  However, my first experience was only marginal.  I hope improvements are made to this service, especially in the communications area.

US banks don't have to report large transactions.  They report a series of transactions less than $10,000 if they suspect "structuring" to avoid the $10,000 limit on **cash** deposits.  A USD transfer from an exchange is not cash so this would not apply.  
The bank may file a SAR (suspicious activity report) if they find a transaction suspicious for any reason, but this is only a report.  Most of these lead to nothing.

That's not correct.  You absolutely can own bitcoin in a "checkbook LLC" style self-directed IRA.  I know because I personally have one.  
The "custodial style" self-directed IRAs like Equity Trust don't allow bitcoin because of the complications of bitcoin custodianship.  However, with the LLC style IRAs you just open up a checking account under the name of the LLC and then use that to send money to the exchange.  No problem.  Legally, your IRA invests in the LLC  and the LLC holds the bitcoin.   Check out Broadfinancial if you want to set one up.

If that is true then a legitimate Amazon gift card holder would be much better off to sell at a 15% discount at Gift Card Granny than at a 20-30% discount at Purso.io so you are proving my point.
Any highly marketable gift card such as Walmart, Home Depot, etc. should fetch more than 90% of its value on resale.  If the discount is more than that it is too good to be true and you are probably contributing to credit card fraud.  If you don't understand this, I can't really help you.

I think that tax offices in some countries refuse to categorize it as a currency because that would force them to admit that it is equal in some ways to the fiat scrip their government issues.

I mostly agree with all of this.  However, I think the analogy of movie torrents is a poor one.  These have successfully avoided shutdown, but they have never faced an adversary as powerful as a state actor with full cyber warfare capability.  
Pirating movies doesn't threaten national security.  Toppling a country's currency does.  Once bitcoin knocks off a third world currency or two, powerful organizations will take notice.  I'm not convinced bitcoin could avoid being crippled if attacked by a nation state (or several of them) skilled in cyber warfare, but I'd love to hear arguments in this direction.

However, since Amazon ships so quickly you will probably receive your item and the fraud will be discovered later.  When this happens you may be investigated by your local police for fraud.

I travel internationally for business.  When I go to countries with closed currencies (such as Angola, Algeria, Argentina) I usually hand carry a few hundred USD into the country so I can exchange for local currency at a better rate to pay for my travel expenses.  It would be just as easy (or easier) to do this with bitcoin as USD.  You might ask around in expat communities, tourist spots or people who travel internationally a lot to see if someone can help you out.  This could work for smaller amounts if you are paying in Kwanza.  If you have access to hard currency foreigners can export up to $10k USD last time I checked.

Yeah, good example of Occam's Razor.  
Why would it be credit card fraud when there are apparently hoards of disadvantaged Mechanical Turks that no one has ever heard from in some third world country that are tripping over themselves to unload cards at unbelievably huge discounts?  It must be that their generosity exceeds their poverty so that they are willing to sell them so cheaply!  
Not only that, but since they are so poor and need to convert their wages to spendable currency immediately they can apparently take bitcoin since it is so easy to convert bitcoin into food and rent in third world countries.  /sarc

In my opinion this is what could save bitcoin from state sponsored cyber warfare.  Basically one state that saw an advantage to adopt Bitcoin could help defend it from other states that sought to destroy it.

I think this could happen, but probably as a last resort.  I see it like this:
* Bitcoin catches on, national currency starts falling in value
* Country considers bitcoin a threat to its currency and attacks with regs, cyber warfare, spies, etc.
* Fiat currency continues to fall
* **IF** bitcoin survives cyber attack, country could adopt bitcoin as currency to replace their failing currency.
Note that this requires bitcoin to be able to survive the cyber warfare assault to begin with.  Capitulation by the government won't happen until they've tried everything else and failed.

I hear what you are saying and you have some good points, but what happens when it's not just a "stress test" that lasts a few days?  What happens when demand regularly outstrips block space supply?  If there is no regulating mechanism, what happens when transaction  demand surges naturally due to buying patterns?  A transaction that costs $0.10 on Sunday might cost a $1 on Monday.  This could result in a poor user experience.  
None of these may turn out to be actual deal breakers in reality, but it seems like a huge risk to take at this stage in bitcoin's adoption cycle.  Approximately 99.8% of the world's population does NOT currently use bitcoin.  We have a TINY toe hold in the market.

Money that is slightly deflationary or slightly inflationary is good for everyone, including young people.  Sound money creates incentives to save and saving is the foundation of capital formation.  Capital can be used to invest in factories and tools to improve efficiency and productivity.  This makes the economy more competitive and makes jobs for everyone, including the young and lower skilled.
High inflation, on the other hand, reduces incentives to save and increases incentives to borrow.  This starves an economy of capital that it needs to grow and leaves it heavily indebted and non-competitive.
High deflation should also be avoided as it makes debts difficult to repay.  The payment may stay the same every year, but if the value of that payment keeps going up it could lead to a default.

I am purely guessing, but I suspect that the originator of any unnecessary (high fee spam?) transactions did not intend to bring the network to its knees.  It looks like someone wanted to make a point and when the point was made they stopped to give the community time to react without actually crippling it.  If they really wanted to cripple the network why stop when the attack was working so well?  To me it smells a lot like the earlier "dust" stress test except this time no one claimed responsibility.
However, if this "shot across the bow" is ignored the next attack might be much more malicious.

No, this has been thoroughly debunked.  Some make the argument that a deflationary currency would discourage investment because one can just save (not invest) a currency that is appreciating.  The reason this is false is that by investing a deflating currency in productive assets one can earn investment returns that are also paid in the appreciating currency as well.  Basically, the economy would adjust and continue on.  
The reason why many government types will tell you that deflation is bad is that *it is bad for government finances.*  If you are heavily indebted such as the government a deflating currency makes it harder to pay back the debts since the payment keeps getting more valuable over time.  Also, the government gets a lot of tax revenue from capital gains which are often times just gains due to inflation.  If inflationary gains are removed, taxes on capital gains will go down.  This cuts government revenue at the same time that their debts are getting harder to service.  This is why everyone from the government will try to get you to accept inflation!

No.  The value of the money may have gone down due to mismanagement, but the money was not stolen in the literal sense (perhaps metaphorically "stolen").  


Correct.  However, the same number of monetary units were still held by the same owners.  Only the value had changed due to policy decision.


Correct. The issuer of the currency reneged on it's promise to redeem each unit for a certain quantity of gold resulting in a devaluation of the currency.  Currency holders have little recourse at this point except to switch currencies.  Remember, the value of the currency before the devaluation rested only on strength of the belief that it was convertible to gold, but in practice this was almost never tested.


Correct.  There were winners and losers as there are with any currency policy decision.  It should also be noted that the currency was not abandoned following this policy change.


Still not a larceny for the reasons I listed in my original post.

Anyway, if there is consensus that we need more than 5,000 then we should figure out what the target number of nodes should be and then find a way to incentivize the network to add nodes until the target is reached.

This is perhaps an arbitrary figure, but if I take it at face value it can still be easily justified and extremely beneficial to society.  The large rate of return in this case is not really justified as a reward for delayed consumption.  Rather it is a reward for taking a very speculative risk to replace one or more fiat currencies in the world with bitcoin.
Fiat currencies cause incalculable damage to societies.  They allow for government theft by inflation and enable excessive government deficit spending with only delayed consequences.  They also make wars more likely since they can be more easily financed by printing &amp; borrowing rather than direct taxation.  If bitcoin were more widely adopted and reduced some of the damage to society caused by fiat currencies, society would benefit greatly.  The high rate of return for bitcoin speculators would have not only been earned, but also a net gain for the rest of society as well.

Of course.  I am thinking about a future time when bitcoin is THE currency and dollars are gone or no longer viable.
 


During a slow transition this might be possible (as it is today).

The loan maturity would be short and the interest rate very high to compensate for the collapsing value.

"Hoarding" is a loaded term.  All capital formation begins with saving.  Once excess savings are acquired beyond one's day to day needs and a small emergency fund the savings can be invested in productive assets as you mentioned.  So stating that "saving is the foundation of capital formation" doesn't necessarily have anything to do with "hoarding" or criminals.


This is not true at all.  Successful speculators are extremely beneficial to society.  They help society by providing accurate price signals to the economy so that scarce resources can be allocated in the most beneficial manner.  By selling or shorting things that are overpriced and buying things that are underpriced good speculators help to provide early price signals of a coming surplus or scarcity of goods.  This allows production to correct before things get too far out of line.  
When applying these principles and a little logic to agricultural commodities it's simple to make an argument that the successful speculator actually reduces starvation and world hunger.  Read [this]( for a longer explanation.

I think speculative investment is a better term than gambling.  You may not realize it, but you are also speculating in currencies.

Nothing would diffuse tension better than making a firm commitment to a block size increase in the road map.  Trust between factions can be restored by making commitments and then living up to them.


Money is a social construct.  Bitcoin only has value if others believe that it does and use it with other people.  The term "politics," obviously has negative connotations, but to ignore the social element of money is to misunderstand its very essence.  Maximizing the value of a currency requires consideration of the needs of all of its potential users which is an inherently political process.

The lack of dividends is a key difference from stocks, but there are still future expectations that can be discounted to present value.

The country subsidizes the cost of electricity making it attractive for bitcoin mining.  However, the government has not invested in or maintained their power plants so they are facing a critical shortage of power.  To make matters worse there is a drought which has crippled production at the nations primary hydro plant.  It's to the point where Maduro considers this a serious threat to his rule.  So now there will be crazy rules to further ration power consumption and I'm sure they will target bitcoin miners as well to reduce power consumption.

There are some good points in this article, but unfortunately the main conclusions are incorrect.
Specifically, these conclusions are incorrect:




The author makes the argument that if the currency is managed in a way that lacks consensus (100%?) then there will be winners and losers for each decision.  Since the currency owned by the "losers"  *may* have less value after a particular decision, the decision is claimed to be unethical because larceny was committed. 
The reason why this conclusion is false and not larceny is that a currency offers no guarantee of future value to any holder (or if there is a guarantee, it's only as good as the word of the issuer).  If there is no guarantee of value, it is not larceny if the value of a currency declines any more than it would be larceny if the value of a stock declined.
Granted, a currency that is routinely mismanaged will fall in value over time.  Also, it is generally a good idea for a currency to be managed in a way that is *fairly* consistent over time and aligned with the expectations of the holders.  However, that does not mean that a change in policy direction is larceny or that a currency would never benefit from a change in policy direction.
A currency gains in value relative to other currencies not because it never changes any policies (forks), but because over time it's changes (or lack of changes) are preferred by currency holders over competing alternatives.
 
Currency is a social construct and has value only because others agree that it has value and will accept it in trade.  Any currency widely used will be held by millions of people.  The idea or expectation that any change must achieve unanimous agreement (consensus) from all holders is not only unwise for the value of the currency and its role in society, but impossible in the first place.

I feel bad for the miners around the halving.  This is how I see it:
* Market anticipates the reduction in supply of new bitcoins and moves the price up before the halving
* Mining is very competitive driving Marginal Cost to equal Marginal Revenue so the higher bitcoin price causes more mining and a higher difficulty level even before the halving
* This makes it just as hard for a miner to "save" or "stock up" on bitcoins before the halving
* Halving occurs - block reward gets cut in half, but difficulty is still high so mining revenue gets crushed until block reward is adjusted downward.
This could be messy for a few months around the halving unless I'm missing something.

OK, great.  I've seen a lot of comments suggesting that core could/might just carry on with a minority of the hash power and that just wouldn't fly.  
Even if the Classic miners played nice and didn't 51% attack them, the core chain miners (if they grew) might try to threaten the classic chain.  It wouldn't be acceptable to allow this threat to even exist.  Therefore, the classic miners would be forced to attack the core chain even if they were "nice guys."  
This is why it's not acceptable to have two chains using the same PoW.  Game theory dictates that the larger chain should immediately attack the smaller chain as soon as possible.

The winning coin will be the "coin of the land" due to network effects and its inflation policy will be whatever it is.

As far as wine shops accepting bitcoin - it all starts with the holders of wealth.  If wealthy people are holding bitcoin there will always be merchants eager to increase sales by accepting it.

Sounds like BS to me.  Many commodities DO settle with physical delivery rather than cash settlement, but the physical delivery listed in the contract is typically to a warehouse or storage facility in the specified location in the futures contract that is suitable for that particular commodity.  For example, crude oil futures delivery is at the storage tank farm in Cushing, OK.
If you didn't read the settlement details of the commodity futures contract a long trader at expiration could become an unwitting owner of a large quantity of a commodity, but it just ends up a warehouse somewhere and they charge you storage fees until you make arrangements to move it or sell it to someone who actually wants to pick it up.  They aren't going to send it to your office!

I would definitely be worried about that.  One thing that suggests that it is real is the ridiculous rates.  If you assume about 1,000 VEF/USD these guys are selling BTC at $629 and buying at $470 - a 33% spread!  Although if this is black market trading they'd need a large spread to make up for the risk.

Eventually there will be demand for actual loans and CDs denominated in bitcoin (other than to fund margin trading).  When this happens Coinbase would be a good partner to a bank.

[Broadfinancial]( has a great service for self-directed IRA's.  Fees are around $1500.  GBTC premium has been hovering around 60%-80% the last few months.  This means that if you are considering putting more than a few thousand into GBTC you'd be better off with a self-directed IRA to avoid the GBTC premium and their 2% management fee.  The self-directed IRA also allows you to hold your own bitcoin without trusting a 3rd party.

Nobody will wake up with two sets of coins.  Existing holders with pre-fork coins (trunk coins, if you will) would be able to continue holding them or spend or move them to either branch once.  
After the "trunk" coins are moved to one branch or the other they are stuck on that branch.  If you later changed your mind and wanted to move to the other branch you'd have to sell the coins of one branch (if they still had value) and buy back in to the other branch.

Fair enough.  Here is how I saw bitcoin and Brexit playing out from my perspective as a trader.  The rally was already underway from 6/26 due to normal reversal from the Bitfinex outage crash.  Then the news about Brexit came out.  This gave a small boost to the existing rally from traders *expecting* Brexit to be a big deal for bitcoin.  Within 24 hours it became clear from exchange volume that Brexit was not going to have an immediate impact on BTC price and the rally reversed.  We are currently just oscillating in a consolidation zone.
I think Brexit could eventually have a big impact on bitcoin especially if Brexit triggers a collapse of the Euro or the EU, but this is going to play out in the long term.  It takes the average person months to wrap their heads around bitcoin and then get accounts opened so they can start using it so it's unrealistic to expect a surprise event like Brexit to have an immediate impact on bitcoin.  
Also think about the suggestion that British people would suddenly decide to get rid of one of the strongest currencies in the world because of a ~9% move and buy bitcoin that makes moves that big or bigger on a semi-regular basis.  For most people that doesn't make sense.
Short term, I am trading the halving and Yuan devaluations that have been much bigger price drivers in my opinion than Brexit.  Opinions of other traders may vary!

That stuff is all fine, I was referring to your explanations of the bitcoin price moves.   
Greece had almost no effect on BTC price during Grexit talk and recent moves have been much more about the halving than Brexit.  The recent rally started about a day before the polls made it look like Brexit would win and were simply reversals based on extreme negative sentiment.  Also, contrary to recent reports from Kraken, exchange volumes in BTCGBP show nothing of any significance relative to Brexit.  
There were some recent big weekend rallys ahead of Monday morning Yuan devaluations where Chinese insiders were trading before the devaluation hit, but nobody mentions those.  Also, Chinese leadership apparently wised up because the last two devaluations did not seem to be leaked in advance.
I'll give you a break, however, since CNBC always wants to put people on the air to give reasons for recent price moves.  Even though the reasons given have little to do with reality people apparently want to hear them anyway.

Decentralization is not binary, there are degrees of decentralization.  Decentralization often provides benefits, but there are also typically costs - a common one is reduced efficiency.  Currently I trade on a traditional exchange because the speed and price are superior than on a decentralized exchange.  Most other traders do too and so they have the bulk of the volume.  
If the regulatory climate changes it may tip the balance the other way, but for now the only people that I think benefit from the decentralized exchanges are those who require maximum privacy for their purchases.

Don't you think people will begin selling in expectation of an approval?  Unless you see the approval notice before everyone else the premium could collapse before you can get your trade executed.  With a 2X premium I'm thinking today is the sell signal.
Edit:  Thought about this some more.  Let's say the COIN ETF gets approved and there is an announcement after the market closes on a Friday.  Everyone panics over the weekend and puts market sell orders in.  GBTC is thinly traded so it could go from a premium of +200% to -10% as soon as the market opens on Monday morning.  You'd be stuck in a gap down with no exit.

I think this is a good idea.  I can think of a few things holding this back.
* A bank could do this at a reasonable interest rate, but they would probably be afraid the currency might develop a flaw (or just crash) where its value could evaporate more quickly than they could liquidate the coins.  This risk could be mitigated if the borrower also had strong credit and the LTV ratio of the loan was low (say &lt;50%).
* The problem above could also be resolved by using a fund that has a higher risk tolerance profile.  However, this would raise the interest rate of the loan.  Also, fiat loans need to meet all the legal requirements of every jurisdiction where they are offered.  You couldn't just have a one size solution for the whole world.  There probably aren't currently enough customers in each jurisdiction to make it worthwhile.
Eventually such loans will certainly exist, but I think you are a bit early!

I think Bitcoin is superior to gold in most ways and that it will take some of gold's "market share" in the years to come.  However, there are a lot of people that will NEVER switch from gold to bitcoin.  They will literally die first and then their heirs will have a chance to make their choice.

If Ledger memory fails I recreate the wallet from seed.  The seed is easy to copy by hand on paper.  I write it in clear text and put it in a secure place.  It might be safer to encrypt the seed, but then my heirs probably couldn't figure out how to access my stash if something happens to me - they aren't crypto nerds like me so this is a tradeoff.  
Is my plan 100% secure?  No, but no plan is and I think it is secure enough given my threat matrix.  Everyone's situation is different and more than one security plan is likely to be acceptable.

You're right - I was thinking of equity on the balance sheet (what I normally look at), but that's not what this is.  I retract my original statement.  
However, I'm still uncomfortable that they seem to be speculating in currencies by not matching the BTC reserves with the obligations.  I'm even more concerned that they appear to be betting against BTC by being under-reserved there.   Although, if they think it has no use cases as they show in their pitch I can see why they are betting against it.

There are always people looking to trade good currencies for weak ones.  You just need to find the right price.  I know because I travel for business a lot to developing markets.  I usually hand carry a few hundred USD cash into the country and either exchange it for local or pay with it directly to get a better price/rate.  Bitcoin would work too, but is harder to find a buyer typically.  
It saves me a lot of money on my travel expenses.  If you use Visa you get the government rate which is often well below the actual free market rate.  Many developing countries don't even take visa anyway.  I know this from personal experience, yet I've been flamed by many fellow bitcoiners who refuse to believe that anyone would trade their precious bitcoins for some weak currency.  
Just because someone is trading or making a market in a weak currency doesn't mean they think it's going to appreciate in value.  They are either a market maker and just making money on trading spreads or they want some currency to use in the near future to buy domestic goods &amp; services.

I thought this was a great article since it provided detail to the cultural differences between the Chinese and the Western bitcoin players.  However, by the time I finished the article I was horrified by comments like this: [my comments in brackets] 
*  this kind of stuff, the Chinese people don’t care about. It’s not in the vocabulary. Chinese people don’t grow up thinking about democracy and decentralization and individual freedom and liberty. [the founders of bitcoin thought about these things extensively and decided they needed to overthrow the current monetary system]
*  while the West wrings its hands over how to upgrade the network, the Chinese Bitcoin community’s attitude is, “Don’t bother me, I’m trying to make my money here.” [ok, I understand, but maybe we should re-align miner incentives]
*  Chinese are used to this one power system — one political system, one political power. [bitcoin is designed to be decentralized with no central power system and will eventually attack the power base (money creation) of existing power systems.]
*  We’re not going to jump ship and vote and create a new political party for ideological reasons. [bitcoin would never even have been founded with a belief system like this]
*  bend with the grass, in Chinese culture, if you stick out, you’re the one that gets run over. You don’t want to be the one that speaks up. You want to be in the crowd, anonymous. [If successful, bitcoin will be attacked/discouraged/banned/vilified by many governments.  This is the opposite of being anonymous and not standing out.  What will they do then?]
*  People in China are not very interested in this decentralization thing [then why are they involved in the project at all?]
*  In Western culture, people tend not to trust authority … but in China they tend to trust.  [Then why not keep using the Yuan and forget about Bitcoin]
*  they are educated to trust centralized power
*  some don’t really understand the protocol at all. They don’t really think about what is the reason of mining or why Bitcoin is interesting
*  in China, the word “vote” is taboo. “No one votes in China,” he says. “You’ve never grown up or lived in a Communist country, but voting is just — we don’t vote. We let the leaders decide. [If they don't realize Bitcoin requires them to vote with every CPU cycle they will have a rude awakening at some point.  They had better get used to the idea of voting or find something else to do.]
*  I never knew I had the responsibility to vote. All I cared about was trying to make my money
I know these are selective quotes from a smallish sample, but this makes me wonder why they should be trusted to mine the network.  The way they are portrayed they might as well be making auto parts instead of mining bitcoin.  
It's just a job for them - there is no support for the philosophical underpinning of this ambitious project.  **They don't want to stand out or challenge authority, but we are planning a currency revolution! The belief system is completely incompatible with Bitcoin's fundamental ideals.**  
Maybe it's not their fault.  After all they are just responding to the economic incentives in the existing protocol.  The comments above, however, make me think that these economic incentives need to be realigned to match those of the users and holders of the currency.  **It makes me wonder if switching to Proof of Stake might be a good idea.**

I work in the CHP (combined heat and power) field and this isn't as simple as it sounds.  The biggest problem is that the waste heat is low quality (low temperature heat).  Due to entropy you want the waste heat temperature to be hotter.  For example, gas turbine exhaust is often above 1000 F and is readily usable. 
To convert lower temp heat back into electricity Rankine Cycle systems can be used, but they are very capital intensive and not very efficient.  
Anyway, I agree that work needs to be done in this area, but there aren't any slam dunks that I can see which probably explains why it's not being done already.

There are probably other risk factors they look at as well.

No one knows for sure.  The simple way to look at it is that fewer new coins being mined reduces the supply.  If the amount of buyers stays the same and supply goes down the price should go up to re-balance supply and demand.  
However, efficient market theory suggests that since the halving event is well known in advance that the price effect should already be "priced in".  To some extent I'm sure this is true.  The real question is whether it is 100% priced in or not...
@_date: 2016-02-25 22:42:57

Yes, oddly enough the dollar and US Treasuries are still considered safe havens even though they are both issued by a bankrupt country.    One can see that now as they rally due to problems in China and Europe.  
Other country's currencies are likely to fail first leading to a rush into the dollar and corresponding price rise, but don't fall for this trap as it will only be a temporary safe haven.
It's hard to tell when the dollar will fail as it is all based on confidence and purely psychological.  One day the confidence will be there and the next it won't.

You are right about the wire.  I was looking to move a larger amount of money so was going to use a wire anyway, but for moving a "few coins" worth ACH is better.  Hopefully now that they are expanding more in US &amp; Canada ACH will come soon.
Regarding verification to Tier 3, I got it recently in two days and Tier 4 (business account) in 5 business days.  This is much faster than the similar levels at Coinbase.  Coinbase's automated systems seem to work fairly well, but if there are any issues and you need customer service they are horribly slow (understaffed?) based on my experience.

Exactly.  If adoption explodes, so will the price.  When block reward drops to 1/2 BTC, the BTC price could be $40,000 each so the block reward of $20,000 would be more than it is today.

The power cost in MA is far too high - looks like 10-12 cents/kwh.  Even if you recovered 50% of your waste heat it can't compete with cheap hydro power at 2-3 cents/kwh.  Also, at 50% heat conversion efficiency with electricity at 10 cents/kwh you are effectively paying 5 cents/kwh for heat which is more than the cost of natural gas in many areas.
Seasonality is also a problem.  Home heating season is only about 4-5 months per year.  What do you do with the investment the rest of the year?  The equipment costs too much to leave it idle, especially when it is obsolete in 18 months.  There are adsorption chillers that can convert waste heat to air conditioning, but with further conversion losses.
It might be possible to try to find a use for waste heat that one could locate close to cheap hydro power and bitcoin mining rigs, but I don't know what that might be.  The best consumers of waste heat tend to be in populated/industrial areas, but the power cost also tends to be higher in those areas.
I saw the article about the liquid cooled mining rigs, but I haven't seen any tech documentation on them so can't comment.

Maybe a very small premium, but the effect would be limited by the fact that you can just use 2 $50 notes instead of a hundo.
I saw this effect personally in Argentina.  When you sell dollars at the unofficial "blue rate" you get a slightly better rate on $100 bills compared to $20s.  The hundos are easier for Argentines to smuggle over the border to deposit into their bank in Uruguay.

Fundamentally people's willingness to accept the dollar, gold, bitcoin or anything else for payment is based primarily on their belief that others will also accept it when they are ready to spend it.  
As time goes by bitcoin's resiliency and scarcity will continue to be demonstrated leading to greater acceptance and higher value.  However, as the US continues to pile up debt at an ever increasing pace people will begin to realize that it will never be repaid or that politicians will be forced to repay it with hyperinflated dollars.  That is the reality that today's illusion of dollar normalcy will correct to.  To deny it is to deny math.  The debt can't be repaid.  That which can not be repaid won't be.

The idea was to intentionally devalue the USD against gold.  This was a means to ease monetary policy and the deflationary effects of the Great Depression and most importantly - to save the banks.  The price of gold before confiscation was $20.67 and $35 afterward    - a whopping 69% devaluation of the USD!  Basically the government chose to throw gold investors under the bus to save their banker friends.  
The government saved the banks again in 2009 with TARP, but it was much easier because we are no longer on the gold standard so they didn't have to confiscate anything.  They just printed dollars. Not much has changed today!

I use bitcoin anyway to support it where I can and I think it will get better in the future, but it is not fun for me to use at all for purchases right now.  Until we get fast/instant confirmations and improved privacy I'll use it primarily for investment purposes.  Hope I don't get down voted to oblivion for a contrary perspective.

Sure, agree with that.  However, many central banks try to hold reserves that roughly match the currency make-up and share of transactions that the country is involved in.

I believe that too.  However, few merchants accept bitcoin yet and only a tiny fraction of those offer a bitcoin discount.  Even when bitcoin catches on, why would merchants regularly offer a bitcoin discount?  
Brick and mortar stores could offer a cash discount over credit cards, but experience over the last 20-30 years has shown that almost none do.  Sometimes on a large purchase at a locally owned place one can negotiate a cash discount, but that's about it.  
Why would bitcoins convince a retailer to offer a discount when cash didn't?  The fact is that most retailers PREFER you to use credit cards despite the fees because research has shown that customers buy more when paying with credit than when using cash.  The retailer makes more money accepting credit cards and paying the fees than when accepting cash.  I don't foresee bitcoin changing this aspect of human behavior.

Guilty or innocent he has reasons to fear for his safety.  I'd pack heat if I were him, too.

This early in the game a lot depends on the individual judge.  My parents and several of my in-laws don't think Bitcoin is tangible wealth either.  They are intelligent college-educated people, too.

I think this is a fallacy.  If deflation was small and consistent loan terms would adjust to take that into account, otherwise no one would borrow.  Deflation is only a problem when borrowers lever up expecting an inflationary environment and then can't repay the loans when the environment shifts to deflationary.

I think it's more likely that one or more of bitcoin's early creators was a disillusioned NSA computer scientist/cryptographer.  He saw the potential for Separation of Money and State to change the world for the better, but this view was not compatible with his day job.

Anticipating it is one thing, but hiring a bunch of people in advance of a bubble when you don't know if or when the bubble is going to occur doesn't make a lot of business sense.  Then, once the bubble gets going it takes off faster than you can scale up and hire people.  If you hire them in advance, everyone is sitting around with nothing to do and you go out of business for having a cost base that's too high.  It's a lose-lose situation.

Buffet only buys businesses with the following traits:
* very well established 
* earn lots of cash with a steady earnings history
* durable competitive advantage (he calls it a moat)
Bitcoin clearly does not have the first one - it's too new.  Bitcoin will never have the second one - it pays no dividends.  The third one is arguable due to network effects.  Anyway, unless he bends his rules I would not expect Buffet to ever buy bitcoin as an investment.

The time to switch to Bitcoin is BEFORE your fiat currency has gone down the toilet, not after.  The average Jose in Venezuela can't afford enough food - why would he buy Bitcoin?  It might be useful for the regime leaders that want to smuggle wealth out, though.

Much of this will be wiped out or inflated away regardless of what happens with Bitcoin.  That which cannot be repaid, won't.  This is inevitable despite the desires of the legacy power structure.  The only question is when &amp; how.

Agree - the bitcoin maximalism is one thing I think should be updated there.  The network effect is very real, but I see room for several coins that are optimized for different purposes.  This includes store of wealth/digital gold, fast/easy transactions for everyday commerce, highly programmable for machines/IoT, maximum privacy, etc, etc.

If governments finish the war on cash by replacing cash with fiat crypto-tokens, then how will the CIA and other security services transact clandestine payments?  Shell companies work OK, but if you can track every token publicly it gets trickier to hide. 
Remember when the CIA was handing out million dollar cash duffel bag loyalty payments to warlords in Afghanistan?   These guys will have to use privacy tokens like Monero or whatever black market tokens are being used at that time.  I would find that oddly ironic if the CIA used the same tokens that the drug dealers use to avoid law enforcement.

I know.  My point is that based on his previous experience he has the skill set to run a software business.  Why not stick with that and try to start another software business?  
Bitcoin mining has to be one of the worst possible businesses to go into - high fixed capital costs, extremely competitive, most success variables are completely out of your control, thin margins and no durable competitive advantage can be maintained.  The difficulty algo is basically designed to keep miners just barely out of bankruptcy most of the time.  It's literally one of the worst businesses I can think of in any industry.

It's my hope that Bitcoin displaces fiat and achieves Separation of Money and State.  I know that this also eliminates Central banks for the most part.  However, the need for basic banking services such as borrowing and lending will always exist.  Banks can go back to doing what they did 40 years ago before the funny fiat business took things over.

They have a long history of working with drug dealers, money launderers, authoritarian despots, Islamist rebels and other unsavory characters.  
Why wouldn't they hide money movements with online drug money?  The biggest problem today is that there isn't enough online drug money to hide their movements in.

Agree.  Borrowing and lending are critical functions of any modern economy.  If bitcoin displaces fiat then banks could lend bitcoin and pay interest for bitcoin deposits.  
I don't understand why so many bitcoiners have trouble wrapping their minds around this concept.  My guess would be that they are young and/or have little experience in business.

I think the "circuit breakers" only work when it's the main exchange with government regulation.  Currencies trade globally and you don't want to implement a circuit breaker on one exchange if the others stay open without a breaker.  You'd end up stuck in a trade and not be able to get out of it.  For this reason I don't think global currency markets have circuit breakers.

Agree that the new paradigm will be an improvement over the old, but it's the transition period that's a real bitch.  There will be a massive depression when the fiat/debt/central bank bubble pops.

This is how I see it as well.  Tokenized fiat on a private blockchain offers all the weaknesses of fiat (unlimited printing) coupled with big brother loss of privacy.  It's the next phase of the war on cash.  
I'm in favor of it anyway.  While it appears that governments are attempting to co-opt crypto tech for their own nefarious devices I think it will only hasten the demise of fiat.  People will get used to using blockchain tokens as money which will help with adoption, but will long for hard money (non-fiat) that is accepted in any country and that offers better privacy.
