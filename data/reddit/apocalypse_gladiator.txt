Can i ask why did you say not to trust ghash? Also, do you think my info might get stolen (such as cc info, etc)?

How does your website get notified that the purchase is done?
@_date: 2015-01-22 07:03:29
Is the amount transferred to the changetip acc in usd or btc?
@_date: 2015-01-25 20:28:26
Pretty cool. So far the site looks fine, and if this works i'll start doing bigger transactions :)

Ok, so i just tested it and made a quick purchase of someone's wishlist. How long does it take to confirm? (I know you say in less than 24 hrs but how much does it really usually take?)
@_date: 2015-01-20 19:55:11
Thanks for the suggestion! I already tested it with the tips from and so i wont need it anymore, but i appreciate the help!
@_date: 2015-01-26 06:57:39
What are you basing that on? Just curious!
@_date: 2015-01-20 18:26:39
I'm not looking for tips. Thanks for the info, but i cant buy btc yet from my country, and was actually expecting some recommendations for good faucets.
@_date: 2015-01-20 19:08:37
Hey! Thank you!! I really really meant it when I said that, so people don't think I'm begging or something, but this is awesome! My first bitcoin transaction ever, thanks :)

i can't use circle because they dont accept credit cards, and so far the only legit-looking website i found that does is cex :/
Edit: oh and im not from the US. So i cant even if they did.
@_date: 2015-01-22 07:45:06
Cool. I sent a request but havent got any email yet. Do you know how long until i am accepted?
@_date: 2015-01-22 07:27:54
Ok so, this is a way to buy lets say, $15 and send them from changetip to your wallet? Is that possible?
@_date: 2015-01-22 10:17:56
What's ghash? I think its something about mining but i'm only looking to buy btc.
@_date: 2015-01-22 10:16:48
Why do think that?
@_date: 2015-01-20 19:24:13
Holy shit!! Thank you too! You guys just made my day :D
@_date: 2015-02-02 02:42:07
I use  because i cant buy in my country and coinbase doesn't work here. Downside is there is a % they take :/

If you didn't place any ticket, then it has to be a phishing attempt.. Or someone you know used your email address i guess.
