I agree there should be consortium like linux foundation that would promote bitcoin and work as a bridge between different parties. Blockstream/core devs is not adequate for the job.

Well the payment request would work in irl environment and could be done outside bitcoin network. The payment request needs only contain:
some ID for payment, public address where payment is sent, payment amount
Then customer would confirm the payment with a button press, which would send it through bitcoin network. When accepting the payment, customer could check that the sum and recipient are correct.

All phones don't have NFC and won't have for some time. Also nfc needs special terminal in shop. Bluetooth is quite cumbersome to connect. QR codes are too complicated because you need camera/point/accept payment. Every phone has mic and it might be possible to make receiving payment info one click event like apple pay.

I have used kraken an bitstamp. They are both fine, but lately I have used kraken more. For storing most of my coins I use bitcoin-qt wallet and for spending blockchain android wallet. They probably are not easiest ones but work for me. Also I usually move the coins out of exchance asap, as I have done since Gox times. Maybe thats why I still have coins :P

Bitcoin was missing protocol that should have been invented among the internet. However decentralized concepts, some experimentation and one brilliant Satoshi was needed for it to materialize.

I watched it too couple weeks back and got the same feeling. 
I can remember back in the 80's when I was biking back from my friends place where we played some C64 game and I thought, we can make _anything we can imagine into reality with this_. Funny thing that in the start of the 2k I saw Lara Croft character ad that covered whole side of the apartment building and thought, damn this is not small thing anymore.
Same happened when internet came. In the beginning of 90s we waited 1h to get one B/W picture to load from internet with some shitty modem, after installing tcp/ip program (trumpet or something), and connecting to my friends university account. 
In the start of 2k napster came, I watched first movies with my pc and learned how to rip music and movies and compression technologies. 
I tell you it is happening again. The napster documentary is worth watching too btw :) Keep dreaming. Things that we want will happen.

Well said. Changing between FIAT/BTC needs to become _transparent_. There needs to be cell phone app that buys bitcoins with one click and pays in bitcoinf straight from credit card when needed instantly. Then we have something.

Some people say Bitcoin doesn't have intrinsic value. I have been thinking that Bitcoins intrinsic value is somehow linked to information. In the end, everything is information...

This reminds me how Linux was back in the 90's. I was very excited about it and was absolutely sure that everyone would in time come to their senses and dump Windows. In some way it actually happened with android and everything else where Linux is hidden behind, but not in the way I thought or hoped it would work out. I'm still waiting that I could play for example games with Linux desktop. Almost 20 years and still waiting. When Linux got to mainstream it also got sort of boring to me. I still think it is great invention among the GPL licensing and a way it is being built and maintained in a decentralized way.
I think this will happen to Bitcoin in time. When it is integrated more to how we use money, it will be boring. Maybe it will not be used the way we think or hope it will either. One thing is certain, cryptocurrencies and technology is a great invention that is going to evolve, and it will take more time than enthusiasts, me included would hope. Actually so much that most of us will lose interest.

Well I wasn't thinking primarily about mining, but vertical farming. I know couple guys who are growing mushrooms in a ship container. They told that they generate a lot of extra heat that could be used growing vegetables. I have been thinking about growing/farming for years. I am an engineer working on IoT solutions so I know measuring/building/coding/analyzing data. I already grow vegetables at my balkony during summer. I have build automatic watering system that can be monitored and adjusted from web interface. It would be really cool if you could or would be willing to share any details of your setup.

Thanks for great wallet. However starting to use Mutlibit HD with Trezor was a bit confusing for me. Why do I need to create multibit wallet, passwords etc if I am only going to use it with Trezor? I mean would it be an idea to ask if one is going to use it with trezor during installation process? Then it could skip the password creation and multibit wallet creation.
