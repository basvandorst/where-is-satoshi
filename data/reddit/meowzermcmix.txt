I've been into this for a while and I haven't seen a reason why I would want to pay anything with BTC either. (Minus drugs)
One thing it is good at is moving money from one country to another. If you can convert back to fiat right away it beats using the old banking transfers that take days.

Boom and bust baby, yea. That's how the fat cats roll (all over the rest of us).

That's a big step into the space by a national financial firm.

The value is in an ever increasingly powerful, decentralized, immutable, and secure network for a seamless exchange of value across country lines and bullshit regulations.

The argument the he wouldn't do it because his business would get hurt is shaky. He's already filthy rich and if his rumored holdings in BCH are true, he could make $1B+ easily from sabotaging BTC and pumping up BCH.
Plus, I wouldn't let anything past the realm of "not possible" with an extremely smart person that also finds it ok with his conscience to pair up with Ver. All he cares about is money. Jihan is going to play the optimal game towards accumulating more wealth even if it takes years to get there and who knows what kind of strategies.

Oh look another random price prediction by someone who most likely owns some bitcoins.

In Malaysia you can pay an electrician to rig your meter to reduce your costs by 80%. It's really risky for miners though because the national electrical department now looks for zones of really high electrical consumption for them. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 04:36:51
You got it
@_date: 2018-05-05 14:26:06
That sounds good in theory but debts have interest rates higher than inflation usually. Unless you have a mortgage in Canada where rates were close to 2% as of last year.
@_date: 2018-05-25 15:42:15
This person gets it. ^  the cost is way more than a billion.

Maybe so but a lot of people don't want and don't like to deal with the risk of handling their coins. I'm a veteran and I still get really nervous sending coins with decent value.

Oh look! It's red. Like a piment that is sometimes used on a pizza. That's cute. Did they make red ones that they needed to offload somehow?

Yea it's not bad but a lot of countries don't have international transfers done online or that don't take 3-5 business days.

I've been running numbers on miners in Malaysia for the last 6 months. Small miners are getting rekt, only people with lots of machines and prepaid costs are making money. There's a ton of s9 machines on the market going for below cost. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 10:13:21
At the same time bitmain put their s9 miners on a serious discount sale. My wild bet is they have a new chip they're "testing".
@_date: 2018-06-29 17:27:52
I'm not an expert on this but from what I understand the devs would change the way the mining algorithm works slightly just to make asic miners not able to work anymore. Since asic miners can only do asic things, it would essentially brick them.
Doing that is easy, but getting the de facto decentralized network agree to interfering against market forces is a whole different bag of coins. I highly doubt it would happen. Forks and things have happened before but not for those kind of reasons.
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:23:37
I guess you don't know that the banking system of most countries are different from one another, and often nonexistent.
You can't wire online in Canada but you can send money via email and max of 3k. There's all sorts of restrictions and limits in place. In other countries it can be much worse.
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:17:23
They had access to the accounts at a random date and were given sworn and notarized bank statements. I'm not sure how much more you need. Bitfinex said official audits are not legally possible at this time because the processes of doing so are not caught to the crypto industry yet. This seems like a sensible position but I'm sure others will disagree and find faults in anything Bitfinex says or does.
The undeniable fact is that today Bitfinex went a long way into proving Tether is fully backed by USD. How about we celebrate this as a good step for the community instead of trying to cannibalize each other?

No it's not, the fees are really low and you can get confirmation really quickly.

That's a small price to pay for controlling your money and your future IMO. I'd love to see a form of protection for entering the wrong address though!

Or you can just not be black and white and invest in both because there's good reasons for both. Then you adjust the money you put in with your ability to handle the risks.

I haven't read anything conclusive about this paper. It's not even reviewed and from what I've read of it it just confirms what tether is used for: a bridge between fiat and crypto. The biggest question still is: is tether really backed by USD? 
@_date: 2018-06-09 02:22:48
Let's crowdsource a list of massive crimes banks worldwide haven't been able to hide from the public (there's lots more we don't know)
- HSBC: money laundering for druglords (2017)
- 9 major Canadian banks accused of rigging rates (2018)
- HSBC, JPMorgan and Credit Agricole: fined 400M+ for rates rigging (2016)
There's lots more, add one or two to the list and then when we've got a big pile of poop we will post it in a new thread called "This is why Bitcoin"

It's a pain in the ass and unless you have great power costs and great location to set up in, it's not worth it. Buying and holding is so much better. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 15:45:31
Yes it's super annoying. It takes an hour+ out of my life to get a wire done. And then you have to wait days to have the money fully sent. Bitcoin takes 10 minutes.
@_date: 2018-06-03 16:39:36
I'd argue that riding the macro story of an "investment asset" while simultaneously building the infrastructure of the new financial system is a much stronger strategy. Bitcoin is a revolution disguised as a get rich quick scheme - perfect to dupe the system into buying into it.
 Every drop of sweat that goes into building decentralized systems can and will be used for the greater good in some way at some point in time when it is right to do so. The cat is out of the hat. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 03:59:25
This is super bullish for the ecosystem. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 04:00:48
You must be new around here. First, no one tells honey badger what to do. He just badgers on and doesn't give a F$ what you want it to do. Bitcoin will probably crash tomorrow just to show you what's up. 
Second, you're going to go *nuts* with crypto if you're focusing on daily or weekly swings. You're going to be eaten alive if you keep doing that, son. So step back, stop looking at the price and find a hobby for the next few years. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:48:38
I believe he means that Bitcoin could put in asic breaking code in and make all of those machines in China useless. See Monero recently.
@_date: 2018-06-23 19:54:20
You're missing the point? It's not about my situation it's about how banks are years behind and billions of people in the world have either no banking or old school banking to deal with.

That's what it took for me to send a wire yes.

Yes or you send a transfer and you can associate a password to it. If it's not entered by the recipient within a time period, the transfer is sent back to you.
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:35:09
It's 3k a day max and like 10k a month max. That's for between participating banks. And yes any wires outside the participating banks or international ones have to be done in person.
@_date: 2018-06-27 15:20:00
If it happens it will trigger a massive wave of aquisitions from big tech companies into crypto.
@_date: 2018-06-20 14:19:12
For those who have arguments saying it's not a full audit, you're right. But the fact is that a legit legal firm is stating "there's enough USD to cover the USDT". That's highly positive and makes me feel way better about Tether now.
@_date: 2018-06-23 12:44:27
That's great, I didn't know that. I've had accounts at 5-6 different banks and I've never seen that.
@_date: 2018-06-07 14:59:52
There's so much debate going on about his comments in ETHtrader right now. Personally I think for sure some hammer fines are coming to some ICO players. I think ETH will be safe because of the nature of their network (the return on money was created by non-central entity.) Thoughts?
@_date: 2018-06-25 00:25:06
Well not really because they own a *lot* of BCH. Like billions worth at its price peak and most of it has never moved out of their wallets. So while it would be bad for BTC, it could be great for them if they can use it well as an opportunity to pump bch. 
Crazier stuff has happened before, it's just overly discounted because we don't make enough space in our minds that something outside the norm can happen. There are a multitude of non-zero possibilities where bitmain can abuse its power and turn it into a positive.
@_date: 2018-06-30 05:13:19
This whole rumour is based on a third party saying it could make sense. That's nothing to run with..
@_date: 2018-06-22 15:33:07
Can't do wires online in Canada. Europe has a much better system in place. We're still behind here but Bitcoin is better than any other system to move value across borders and people.

I understand your ethos and most likely a lot of us early supporters got into the space for certain ideals and values. Those things still very much exist today but there will be some expanding of the network where things will be seen in a different light.
All the things like Custody are great for the values we got into this for. Bitcoin can and should disguise itself into whatever shape it needs to take to enter the financial systems in all the corners it can find. Once it's in, it's in. We should welcome every way Bitcoin infiltrates the system because in the end its underlying guiding principles and way of operation can never be changed. 
@_date: 2018-07-02 21:56:58
Well I guess you can be extreme in your view. But in the end what is truly going on is that the decentralized ideas that come with "Bitcoin" or whatever you want to call it, still spread into the world regardless of the shape it will take. It's a step forward. If anyone wants to deal with your "pure Bitcoin", they can still do this and will be able to in the future at all times.
