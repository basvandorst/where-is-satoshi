Thats the problem with btc companies, products are sl easily replicated it's hard to monetize. I think bitpay is feeling some of this currently

Mostly disagree, makes some good points. Nothing that will kill it though

There is nothing innovative about an incomplete project
@_date: 2015-12-03 18:36:42
Yup the best way
@_date: 2015-12-08 02:04:44
So much censorship!!!!!
@_date: 2015-12-12 02:30:46
Yes yes and yes

what are your thoughts on ethereum?
Your thoughts on pow v pos?
Why is it taking so long for more adoption?
@_date: 2015-12-13 00:41:32
Yes and no, it does make it more usable but not much for the ecosystem or value.
@_date: 2016-01-29 00:45:44
Big move imo

That just outsources the risk to another chain that can be more easily be manipulated to commit fraud on the main chain. And if you think about altcoins they are almost all based on the bitcoin source code, and if fundamentally different, they are at the very least idealogically based, effectively making them hard or soft forks. I would rather have an altcoin with a clear differentiation point relative to bitcoin on another coin that self contains its risk/innovation within that own chain and network. If it proves to be successful great, that will be reflected within the exchange rate between the two. If it proves to be an utter disaster it will be contained within the network and not effect the rest of the ecosystem. I beleive this will limit fraud and will give crypto the necessary breadth to scale. Risk cannot be completely eliminated but it can be mitigated and contained.

Lololololol 
@_date: 2016-01-21 22:33:43
True, hopefully a decentralized exchange comes along.
@_date: 2016-01-21 20:36:47
They already do,  they're called alt coins
@_date: 2016-01-22 21:54:19
Thank you for clarifying. I guess the issue for me then is if zero confirmation sidechains are implemented, is there not the ability to commit fraud on that sidechain and then sneak those changes into the main btc chain?

Pulling my money out right when i get back on. Kraken lost my business
@_date: 2016-01-21 21:05:52
The pegs are the exchanges

My quam with sidechains is that they are just hashing transactions on another chain, why not just use that hashing power towards the main btc chain? Dont really see how it solves the problem

I don't think it would hurt the fungibility of bitcoin. Being that crypto currencies are merchant or reciever favored, wouldn't it be valuable to have a website that can alert users if there is a bad actor behind one of these accounts?
Lets say that for some reason you were to make a purchase online for some sort of good or service, what if after you send your bitcoin the person on the other end decides to withhold their product or service? Or even worse, it was just a scam the whole time.

Right on bro. I'm not putting all my eggs into it but I have a substantial amount of my income dedicated to bitcoin. The famous commodities investor Jim Rodgers said that commodities (which I see bitcoin as, not so much a currency) drops 50% multiple times on its way to market success. Goes up 200%, down 50%, up 150%, down 50%...sound familiar?! ;p
To the moon!

Not so much uberization as it will be decentralization

Bitcoin is revolutionary in terms of value transfer, the sole purpose of money, big problem is the volitility. Exchange rate garuntees can work, but when it comes to a bigger scale the price fluctuations cant be covered by the bitcoin exchanges. Mass adoption or increased applications may have to come first before banks can use it as their backbone money transfer 
@_date: 2015-10-03 23:26:25
I disagree and say it is more likely because of the hyperinflation of their currency 
@_date: 2015-10-24 06:29:14
What sectors are you guys looking at which you think bitcoin will have the biggest impact? And also how are you guys plan on implementing bitcoin into your operations?
And thanks for doing this!!

My question with 21 is how will it be at all profitable or reasonable for the average joe, or anyone without bitcoin for that matter, to have a 21 computer/miner. Its so hard to be the first to reach a block nowadays and will be even moreso in the future. How will anyone make any bitcoins from it?
