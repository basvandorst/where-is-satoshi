Which dispensary takes Bitcoin? I'm in Colorado and I'd love to visit, but I've been unable to find the name of the business. I would seriously go there today if I knew where the place was. Is there a better source than the brief mention in the video linked by this article? I don't want this to actually be nonexistent.

Also, one of the panelists mentioned Colorado Springs being so cash-strapped that they were forced to turn off the lights for awhile... Colorado Springs city council voted against allowing recreational marijuana sales within city limits, so they'll be missing out on tax revenue (and tourist dollars). Not very smart of them. On the bright side it will be allowed in adjacent Manitou Springs.

It's a shame, especially considering that a slim majority of voters in the COS/El Paso County area were in favor of Amendment 64 (to legalize). As such many residents of the city are understandably upset about the decision. The military sent a few doomsaying representatives to townhall meetings leading up to council's decision- it was pretty ridiculous. It's still going to be legally grown in the Springs by individuals, there's a thriving decade-old medical industry already in the city, people can easily drive to Pueblo/Denver/soon Manitou to purchase it recreationally... marijuana will always be there anyway. Military personnel from the bases and the Academy will avoid it, just as they always have. After seeing the revenue already made elsewhere in the state I bet some members of the city council are already beginning to reconsider.
