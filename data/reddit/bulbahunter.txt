You understand that 0.01 to 10,000.00 is literally a move that multiplied the value of bitcoin by 1,000,000x. 
If we were to multiply Bitcoin now by that, you're looking at $10,000,000,000 Bitcoin right? 
We will never see 10 billion for a Bitcoin unless 600 years pass and it still is popular. By then the technology will outpace the cryptography and there will be something else.

Fair enough.

From the literal beginning when it was pennies a coin, sure. Now? Nah my guy. Not unless BTC hits 500,000k. You're lucky to get 30% if you do it over a ten year period starting today.

But you can't make 1000% returns DCAing.

Unicef is one of the worst charities. They're not doing it for the kids. They're doing it for themselves.

I believe UNICEF is 2nd worst in how much money goes to the actual causes behind Red Cross.

Good. Eff him and his scheme with Bitcoin cash. Loser. He took billions off people as a scam.

This guy here acting like Ver didn't cause mass chaos for a profit on the Bitcoin community over BCH. FoH.

Please. Sell me your BTC then. No use for it if it won't be valuable in 100 years. You must fall in the AOC camp for special kids.

If any one thinks fiat will replace Bitcoin in 50 years, they're delusional.
