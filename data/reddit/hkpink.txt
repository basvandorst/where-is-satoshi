Nothing that I’ll be posting on this stupid app. The disrespect is overwhelming so everything will be dealt with via lawyers. Sorry

They announce his death a month later because it was a tragedy for my family. He was on his honeymoon. Show some respect please.

It is very sad news, and is 100% true. He was on his honeymoon while also visiting their orphanage in India. No exit scam. Everything was done privately. No obituary was made for Gerry. His funeral was held with loved ones that needed to be there. Not everything has to be made public especially something so tragic for my family.

I am far from acting like a child, especially compared to the messages and posts I have been reading. I am so offended because it’s disgusting humans act this way. The company is in good hands with Aaron. His death is a private matter, especially when its still so fresh. Do you even think the wedding pictures were done and complete and sent to the couple before He died??? Do you think she wants those pictures being floated all over the internet for the world to see her fairytale turning into a nightmare?

Wow. If only you knew the real Gerry and the pain and suffering he went through in his last moments. I will pray for you.

His own personal money is his own personal money. He was a good man and helped others. You are a disgrace of a human. Wow.

You’ve got to be the biggest low life I’ve ever had an interaction with. Posting this under a post in relation to this young mans untimely, painful and tragic death is just disgusting.

He sponsored an orphanage with his wife (my family) in India. I 100% know he’s not alive. And the lack of respect of a family and questions of if he’s alive or not are absolutely disgusting and you should be ashamed of yourself.

His body is where he was laid to rest just mere days after he was brought back to Canada you insensitive jerk. Funeral arrangements were kept private and everything remained private for my family. He died on his god damn honeymoon. He and his wife sponsored an orphanage in India and were visiting which is when he passed away from his horrible disease. My family would only dream that this was all fake. But the reality is... that it isn’t. And we have suffered a tragic loss and all you care about is tearing it apart and being entirely disrespectful.

His death is not suspicious whatsoever. He had chrons disease. The man suffered. He got married two months before his death whilst on his honeymoon. His company won in court with all the money. Good try at attempting to degrade someone who has passed. I hope it makes you sleep at night. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 02:14:35
Unfortunately his death is not related to that. So for your other posts.... they are disgusting. And you should again be ashamed. I hope and pray nothing tragic happens to your family as it has to mine.

The sad part of all of this is that someone should not have to prove if their family member has passed. It’s called living a private life while having a company. Not everything needs to be made public. Nothing needs to be proven. Chrons can be fatal. Especially when there’s complications. If you and all these other people want to think this is all fake... go ahead. I’ll continue to grieve with my family, his wife, etc. and pray for you to learn to have respect for a family. This is a nightmare for my goddamn family and these messages are absolutely disgusting.

It’s called privacy. There’s pictures of everything. But fortunately, they aren’t made public. The people that are deserving of wedding pics, plaques of their orphanage, etc., have access to all.  Losing a loved one is hard enough to deal with, let alone while in another country, and right before the holidays. You are nothing but a piece of trash with the words you speak. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 02:06:50
Show some damn respect for my family during this time of tragic loss ffs. Grow up
@_date: 2019-01-16 02:27:00
Cool! Hope your hurtful words that you’ve said make you feel better knowing you’ve said it to a grieving family member. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 02:18:00
Wow. Seriously jackass?!?!?!
