Thank you thank you. I no longer want to return my unopened Trezors. You were quick to move away from OSS at the first threat, but you were also quick to move back once you realized it was important to us. I will fully stand behind your project and point folks to your hardware. I hold no grudges.

Right. However, those that complained loudly (I was one) that they felt betrayed when the change was made should now be the loudest proponents. The only people who do not make mistakes are the ones not breathing. Anyone who claims that there is nothing the SL team can do to regain their trust probably didn't have it to begin with. 
Kudos to and for pushing back the fear and moving on their convictions.

Browsing the source on github reveals some shoulders the team stood on in order to bring this device to market. The STM (libopencm3 LGPLv3) library made it possible bring up the microcontroller quickly. Some of the crypto files were derived from external sources and are OSS (to be fair: they are still OSS in the repo). If all of those were "view only", how long would the development cycle been? I say this as a customer of 2 "first editions" and 4 purchased devices. I'm not defending the rip off element, however, every OSS project has that potential and must choose to remain grounded in OSS principles or cease to be an OSS project. The number one reason I supported the project from the beginning was because it was advertised as OSS.

Not open source and not OSI approved. It's a shame that you feel threatened into abandoning your principles.
Edit: SatoshiLabs has reversed course and reverted the license change back to LGPLv3; and there was much rejoicing! THANK YOU. Let's pretend this never happened.

The link in their news article has the TREZORs for $89.00 (25% off) using code "opensourcematters89". That is a kind gesture and an opportunity for us  to put our money where our mouth is.
Edit: I also purchased 2 more using the code.

I'm in the same boat. People that claim that the "OSS" part of Trezor was not a big selling point or the change is no big deal do not understand why. Sure having the code available to inspect for auditing and security is nice, but that isn't the reason for OSS. The reason is so the community can adopt, extend, and support this product long after the inventors have moved on or lost interest. Had it been closed or "reference only" from the begining, I wouldn't have given it a second thought.
Edit: TREZOR has reversed course and reverted the license change back to LGPLv3; and there was much rejoicing!

I hope so as well. Here was nostalgic moment I was hooked:

Your response is encouraging. OSS is inheritance to future generations.

According to their website FAQ: The wallet is not open source because they need to protect 10 years worth of patent pending research and development. I'm not interested.

However, the android app is OSS.

From their LICENSE file:
















Here is a thought excersie: What if each of the components were licensed using the MS-RSL instead of the Apache license by their respective owners? How would have Mycelium been able to distribute their app?
@_date: 2015-01-30 02:25:28
They may have no interest in doing so. I haven't found any info on their site about their current license situation. Perhaps it is embedded in their apk. I do not use it.
Edit: The source code hosted at GitHub does state the license for mbw as MS-RSL.

Thanks for the tip about Mycelium. I'll make sure to steer clear of it as well!

I'm going to ask for a refund of my unopened purchased units. They were angry about the knock-offs. I'm angry about the 180 degree turn of events over the last couple of days. Your open source project turned out to be a scam.
Edit: Since SatoshiLabs has reversed course on the license (back to LGPLv3), I also will reverse course on requesting a refund. Thank you very much for doing this!

The GitHub ToS states the following (


I suppose you can fork a Ms-RSL licensed work. However, I'm not really sure why you'd want to!
