Why does the fee for transferring btc change? I asked around and they said because the miners switch to mine something else with easier mining difficulties. Why those this make the fee increase ?

I have only been putting money in bitcoin for the last half year and reading about the block chain technology. And I can honestly say it’s very difficult to understand everything. But everyday I’m trying to learn a little bit more of this fascinating technology.

Guys i have a question: Im going to buy bitcoin with large sums more frequently. My local bitcoin seller/buyer dosent have really friendly prices. Which exchange do you guys recomend with friendly fees and good reliability?
 I live in Norway and this is my plan. I have a trezor wich i try to put in as much as possible to hodl. Is there a exchange with good fees where i can transfer the crypto currencies to my trezor and have some left on the exchange to trade with?
I heared that coinbase have refused to pay out people that have had large sums in theire wallets. So this is why im a little bit paranoid. Which exhcange do you recomend to trade large volums of cryptocurrencies with?

With the price of bitcoin and other alt coins decreasing. Is it smart of me to buy ltc and eth with my btc ? I’ve never watched the prices in btc value and only in usd prices, something I regret now. Would it be wise of me to buy altcoins now with bitcoin ? Or should I wait ?

Thank you for a simple and good explanation. Is there a book, documentary or website that provides learning and information of bitcoin ? Because I have a friend who is pretty deep in the BTC world. But every time I link him something related to BTC he answers ah no, not the Chinese corporate miners. Oh no not John McAfee again, he supports bch and is a corporate douchbag. And I don't want to be a nagging asshole spaming my friend with basic noob questions several time daily 
How can I now what I'm reading is actually good information and not some brainwashing propaganda

The way ive been doing it so far is like this:
Im watching the price almost constantly
I read on tradingview what the analytics thinks will happen, i buy form what i thik is the mon ths cheapest price and sell for what i think wil the be months highest value.
So far so good, but the fantstcis think with bitcoin is: if youre in minus just hodl and w8 for it to go to zero
