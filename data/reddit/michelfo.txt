Here the goal seem to be to determine how various people will react (miners, nodes, users) in a situation where the network is saturated with transactions and find out how much disruption it causes. There's no other way to do it than on the real network.
When you do a fire drill, you do it in the real building while people are doing regular activities. Any other place or moment would make the drill pointless.

I think a better comparison would be the transition IPv6. We've been out of IPv4 addresses for some time, but things continue to work mostly because many people/devices are behind a Network Address Translation. Many things are tricky to do when you're behind NAT, but it's rather hard to see when IPv6 will become mainstream at this point.
Similarly, we could extend the block size, but this is a protocol change. Changing a protocol implemented by many systems all around the world gets trickier and trickier with time (especially if it isn't a trivial change). If we can't figure out how to make the block size higher, we might be condemned to workaround solutions (sidechains, side channels...) for a long time, like NAT is essential for IPv4 right now.

Actually Bitcoin Core 0.9.0 dropped the standard fee to relay transactions to 0.01 mBTC, at least the [release notes]( say so, making such transactions acceptable to the network. But that doesn't mean it creates transactions with this new fee structure yet... they are waiting a few months for this change to propagate before actually lowering the fee I'd guess. That would explain why it's very rare to see such a transaction on the network: no wallet does it by default at this time, not even Bitcoin Core.

You know, if you are a small software developer there's a chance you can easily discount your apps 50% and still make a profit. Development is mostly all sunk costs and new users generally bring a minimal load of support work.
If you are a big retailer selling a lot of things of various kinds, you can probably make a big discount at a lost and recoup that with sales of other things people will want when they see it next to the discounted item. Or at least customers will now know what kind of things you sell and are more likely to come back later, so it might be only a temporary loss.
But if you are selling one specific kind of item, one people don't need to replace too often (such as gloves, if they're any good), you can't sell it at a loss just to attract customers. I don't know what is the bill of materials and the wages necessary to make those gloves, but I can understand not wanting to make a huge discount if the margins are thin. Those are made in USA and competing with products from Asian countries, I can't imagine the margins being huge.

The most natural way PayPal could integrate Bitcoin would be to treat it as a currency and like other currencies you'll be able to hold and convert inside your PayPal account. They could of course integrate it as a payment mechanism without the possibility of holding bitcoins in your account, but I feel that would be quite confusing.
The biggest question is how do you move your bitcoins out of the PayPal network without making it easy to fraud. Say you refill your account with a credit card (or someone hijacks your account and does it for you) and then you then send (or the hijacker sends) bitcoins somewhere outside of the PayPal network (an irreversible transaction). What happens then if you go to your bank and tell them you never purchased this and you get a chargeback? I guess they could somewhat lessen the problem by making it very slow to move bitcoins out (a few days, like when you withdraw to your bank account).
Another interesting question: will PayPal users be able to pay directly a merchant with Bitcoin? If allowed, PayPal customer protection policies and arbitration procedures won't be enforceable (can't reverse a Bitcoin transaction). If not, the merchant will still be required to have a PayPal account to receive the bitcoins, but that still requires the merchant to trust PayPal with its money.

Coinpoly seems a little opaque to me. What country is it from? I can't even find a postal address on the website. The domain's whois points to WHOISGUARD, INC. P.O. BOX 0823-03411 in Panama.
Anyway, I made a small BTC purchase. The Paypal account it is paid to is named "Paycoin", is outside of the US, is non-verified, and the email address is coinpoly at gmail. That's what Paypal has to say on the transaction page. The Paypal receipt is very clear about what is sold (x.xx BTC will be sent to address 1xx...).
The Coinpoly site has no list of pending purchases. So right now I have to trust they have correctly received the purchase on their side and will be sending my coins in 4-5 days (which is slow, although not slower than sending money to my bank from Paypal).
The site would be easier to trust if it was running over HTTPS. I don't want a man-in-the-middle attacker trying to substitute my bitcoin address for his own when I make a purchase (even though I know I can double check it on the Paypal receipt before payment).
I hope this little review will allow the site to improve. Now waiting for my coins.

That screenshot is interesting. While the message they gave you is about cryptocurrencies, the screenshot shows a different violation of their rules.

Which makes sense if you want to protect your economy from foreign industrial espionage. You have to break the model where some companies centralizes all the information about your citizens in foreign hands and instead store this information within your borders.
But you know what won't be affected by this? Email. Because email is a protocol and it can be hosted by anyone and still interoperate with other email providers elsewhere. And Bitcoin is similar to email in that regard. So perhaps Coinbase and BitPay won't be able to operate in Russia and elsewhere, but that's an opportunity for local entrepreneurs to fill the void.

If you pay via PayPal, you'll eventually hop to the PayPal website which will show the email address, or the company name, you're sending money to before you make the payment. The PayPal website is always served using HTTPS. And if you didn't double check the receiver name or email and you become aware later that you've been tricked, you can probably get PayPal to reverse the charge.
So in short: yes, compared to Bitcoin addresses transmitted unencrypted, it's safer to send money with PayPal because it all works over HTTPS which is encrypted and authenticated with a security certificate. If you want to use Bitcoin like PayPal you can use an account at Coinbase, Coinkite, or Circle and you'll be able to use an email as the destination address, all over HTTPS, just like PayPal... and with some of the drawbacks of PayPal too (centralized entity holding your money).
It's always best to establish authenticated communication channels. For instance, I often transmit Bitcoin addresses over Apple's iMessage (which has end-to-end encryption: not even Apple can decrypt the messages). Even Twitter or Facebook private messages are more secure than email (only Twitter/Facebook could tamper with them). But unencrypted email and unencrypted HTTP will always make me want to double-check the address.

Apple Pay is just a client-side interface for payment networks. Currently it only works with credit cards form participating banks, but there's no reason they can't extend this to other kinds of payment networks. When Bitcoin becomes mainstream enough, they'll add support for it.

The way it's supposed to work is that both parties lose their BTC deposit as well as the transferred amount if they can't agree. This will work if you assume the other party is acting rationally and wants its deposit back and the other party isn't maliciously trying to cause you harm (the same deposit amount might be disposable pocket change for one party while it is a significant sum to the other).
Probably not a fatal flaw however.

On the other side, if you get robbed and someone else steals your friend's private key you're keeping a backup of, you'll have to explain to your friend why the funds aren't there anymore. That won't impress them at all. (Not that it's very likely at the moment though.)
@_date: 2014-11-21 13:21:01
This is indeed a valid concern. I'm suspicious of any Bitcoin address I see on a HTTP page too.
You have no control of where your packets travel to on the path from your ISP to a distant server. There's many hops, and it only takes one malicious/hijacked router along the way to substitute a Bitcoin address in a packet for one of his own.
HTTPS is not only to protect secrets, it also protects integrity of communications. You can never be sure on a plain HTTP page whether the content was altered or not in transit somewhere on the internet.
Email, which often transit unencrypted, is also something to worry about. As Bitcoin becomes more mainstream, the incentives increases for those in a position to tamper with addresses in transit.

Interesting. Seems like I overlooked the signature part. That said, I don't see why JSON would be a problem: just put the PaymentDetails JSON structure serialized as a string inside the Payment JSON structure, and sign this UTF-8 string.
Also, the signature isn't necessarily the hard part if I can use a "none" pki_type and serve it from an already-authenticated HTTPS server. I'm not sure how clients would handle that though (not tested anything yet). And I'm aware this doesn't scale to other protocols than HTTPS, but it's not like my website can reach you over bluetooth anyway.


Perhaps. Depends on what it provides and what are its dependencies. I'd be happier with a PHP library though. And I'd be even happier if it was easy to implement with less third-party code.

But are you sure your email provider admin person can't access the email either in transit or when stored on the server? Unless the content is encrypted using client-side tools, emails are generally easy to get at if you have the right privileges on the server.

Consensus must be implemented exactly the same way by all full nodes.

It just didn't fit into my time budget. It's also more components to trust, more things that could break.
With JSON I could have read the spec and implemented it with json_encode/json_decode in a heartbeat without looking at any sample code. Now I have to integrate the protocol buffer parser within my system before I can do that. Nothing terribly complicated, but definitively more work and more time.
I really wonder why the protocol has been defined in term of protocol buffers.

My point was that such an attack on the network can only inflate the block sizes proportionally to your hashing power. With 2% hashing power, one out of fifty blocks can be be maxed out to 20 Mb by a bad actor while other miners are likely to keep using the default value. With a default value set to 2 Mb (at some point in the future), with all blocks filled, that would make the average block size be (20\*1+2\*49)/50 = 2.36 Mb. That average increases the more hashing power you get. But it's unlikely most miner will want to max out their blocks because of the slower propagation time.

That's correct. But keep in mind that big blocks are going to happen anyway at some point if only due to growth of the transaction number. All an attacker can do is make it force things happen sooner.
Fun fact: in  if those maxed-out spam blocks really become problematic for the stability of the network, there's always the option for honest miners to collude to start rejecting blocks that go beyond a certain threshold. If those miners have more than 51% of the hash power, they can force all those blocks to be orphaned and dropped, despite them being valid blocks. But that'd be quite a desperate measure me thinks.

Not entirely. If you buy an asset and it increases in fiat value because of inflation, then you'll eventually have to pay some tax on the capital gain when you later sell that asset. But capital gain is generally taxed less so indeed it's better to horde assets.
Of course, if you buy an asset for consumption (eggs), then you have no capital gain because you never resell that asset. But nobody is going to horde eggs as even without inflation they lose their value quite fast.

Another problem is that it inflates the money supply by creating virtual dollars, pushing prices up and forcing more people into debt to purchase things they could afford otherwise.
And yet another problem is if later a big bank defaults and all those virtual dollars disappear, then the money supply shrinks abruptly and the economy crashes because wages and prices won't adjust fast enough. So then the money supply has to be adjusted by the government and/or the central bank to save the economy. The less disruptive way to do that is to bail out the failed bank, essentially making those virtual dollars into real ones. Resulting in a situation were banks can create money at will, money on which they collect interests.
With Bitcoin this could happen too if people's perception makes those virtual bitcoins valued as much as bitcoins you control yourself. This would enable fractional reserve, and eventually economic crashes. Although in such a crash, no one will be able to bail out the bitcoin bank and the economy will suffer proportionally to the size of the bank. And eventually people will learn not to trust banks. Better to learn that now though.

It is interesting to note that even if the hard limit is raised, the soft limit can still be maintained lower. Therefore, blocks won't necessarily inflate easily to 20 Mb instantly when there is a sudden transaction storm. Raising the hard limit just allows miners to set their own limit higher, and most of the miners seem willing to follow the default the developers have set.
Another observation: there is no reason for miners to rush to be the first with a block over 1 Mb and start the fork. Quite to the contrary, the fork brings some uncertainty to the values of the mined bitcoins (new bitcoins are backward-incompatible), so there is a disincentive to be the first one mining such a block. That means there's a good chance it'll take a while for the blockchain fork to actually happen, even if the majority of the network is ready to accept it.

I'm pretty sure if it happens it'll happen by the user being offered to pay through an app he has installed on his device displayed alongside the available credit cards. I don't think Apple is going to enter directly into the "bitcoin wallet" market: better leave the liabilities of securing funds to third party app developers.
As for how it could work... I guess somehow Apple Pay could be upgraded to understand other payment methods (including some standard protocol for Bitcoin, I think there's already one) so that at the sale point it could list the compatible payment apps and forward the request to it.
The most important question is: how does Apple get their cut of the transaction?

The traditional way to do it is for the merchant to automatically charge according to the policy he sets and for the customer to contest (chargeback) any payment he did not agree to. Clearly another approach is needed for Bitcoin where transactions are not reversible.
Someone should design an extension to the payment protocol for recurring payments. Then seek reviews by publishing a BIP. Then, at some point, the protocol will be defined well enough that wallets will be able to add support for it.
Here's an idea: one way it could work is akin to a RSS feed: the wallet periodically checks for future payments for each subscription, and when the time comes if the next payment is within the time and amount boundaries the user has previously agreed to, the transaction is made, otherwise the wallet app somehow prompts the user for what to do. If the users so choose, the wallet could prompt the user for every payment (I personally would want that option). If the merchant changes billing amounts or schedule, it'll be reflected in the feed and the wallet will know and inform the user if necessary.

What Circle needs is a way to read a QR code or bitcoin URL with an amount in bitcoin, then take that amount from the wallet and send it at the right place, all in one operation.
And as a bonus, if not enough bitcoin is available in the wallet, offer the user to complete the bitcoin amount using with the credit card/bank account they have on file. If the user says Yes, then the payment is handled all automatically. This is not unlike how PayPal goes to your credit card when you don't have enough fiat in your PayPal account.
But the current process of copying amounts and addresses is error prone, doubly so when everything is shown in dollars by default and when Circle doesn't honor the chosen bitcoin amount when you purchase bitcoins (it rounds towards the nearest cent).
