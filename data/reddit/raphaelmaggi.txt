Have you ever had any problems with any business? If you hava a problem and the company seems to ignore you you try to be vocal about it to try to solve it

You can't just use a lack of adoption to complain about bitcoin, it's like complaining of the internet in the begining because there is nothing to do there.


To me this is a problem of adoption too, when bitcoin become more widespread its fluctuations will become just like another currency


If the costs to the merchant is lower, it can lower the price to compete


There is a lot of services that do not need to deliver anything to your door, any virtual good is an example

Only if you have fiat. If you start receiving wage or acepting only btc you will only spend btc too
@_date: 2014-09-11 13:34:54
It doesn't make any sense to offer a discount greater than what would cost you to buy btc with the fiat price
@_date: 2014-09-23 17:00:23
If your income is in bitcoin you don't have do convert to your local currency.

I think when you pay with CC, you pay the costs of the CC chargebacks. If you trust the company, paying with BTC could be cheaper.
@_date: 2014-09-12 17:11:45
It's it costly to me to keep converting brl-&gt;btc and btc-&gt;brl. I'll start using btc more when my employer be able to pay me with btc, which will be easier if he accepts btc, not having to convert either.
@_date: 2014-09-10 12:56:26
The problem is that you have to keep converting usd-&gt;btc and btc-&gt;usd. When you start receiving wage for example in btc and you can keep it to buy anything, there is no need to convert anything anymore and we can all start using btc only

Imagine you discovered a machine that can build things for nothing, no fuel, no electricity, no nothing. Is that bad?
Now imagine one person working and not consuming anything, no food, no computers, not buying nothing. Isn't this almost exactly like the machine above? How this suddenly becomes bad?

100 bits

It's not exactly a fair comparison. Bitcoin is a currency, credit card is a service. You have to compare bitcoin to dollar, and to me bitcoin is undoubtedly superior to dollar.
@_date: 2014-11-21 19:31:53
This is not exactly a fair comparison. Off course it will have some advantages to receive dollar if you want to send dollars because you don't need to do any conversion. You will have extra costs if you have to convert to bitcoins, euro, yen, gold or whatever.
But if you don't need to do any conversion, if you want to send and receive bitcoin, then bitcoin is obviously better than fiat.

Which countries were more easy to spend bitcoins?
@_date: 2016-06-16 12:41:54


No, I think miners should be the ones who decide how many transactions to include into a block, not you
@_date: 2018-10-09 15:17:56
Why bother with step 2 then?
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:17:20
Bitcoin used to attract mostly libertarians. It doesn't seem the case anymore, full of socialists here.
@_date: 2017-08-28 13:36:05
So only the miners who agree with you matters?
92% of the hashrate is supporting Segwit2x, but that part you ignore, right?
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:26:02


Yes I will.
@_date: 2017-08-07 23:23:38


Nope. Miners wanted 2 MB blocks since long ago. See hong kong agreement.
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:02:12
I think it's a valid and very important point that really should be tried. But you have to understand:
THAT IS NOT BITCOIN.
That's why we are in this perpetual conflict. You guys are trying to force this idea on everyone else: those who wanna try this other idea, that we can in fact increase the blocksize and still be decentralized. And that what bitcoin originally is. I think it's a perfect valid position to try to make a cryptocurrency as low resource as possible, but this IS NOT BITCOIN, you'll have to create an altcoin and not take bitcoin and force this change on it.
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:22:13
You don't have to invent you own definition of bitcoin, we have the whitepaper, we have the inventor himself saying exactly why and how it should work. Don't like it? Create your own cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:40:01
You don't have to agree with satoshi and the whitepaper. Create your altcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:57:11


Isn't exactly this what people are doing? You tell people people to go to an altcoin and when they go do you call it an attack?
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:38:32
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:50:57
You are way off here. If you lower prices, demand rises. If the bus ticket decreases, there will be a lot more than 200 people. The fee will in fact decrease, but will be a lot higher that 0.
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:28:24
No, you can't even say you support s2x, you get in the blacklist
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:24:33


You are being childish. Miners can use their hardware to mine whatever they want, they can buy whatever coin they want, whenever they want. You are just pissed because they are not following your prefered coin.


I agree with you, but it's not clear other coins are less immutable than bitcoin. To me, today, they are as immutable as bitcoin, but cheaper.
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:02:38
In a compromise both sides cede something they didn't really want. What did Core ceded?
@_date: 2016-09-13 14:33:44
self owning car? Really? This is getting delusional..
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:31:58
Read both and take your conclusions. FAQ may be a good introduction to why it exists.
@_date: 2016-10-18 13:09:40
Did you use just the current price for your calculations? I see you have transactions since july, since them the price has increased
@_date: 2018-04-25 17:23:02
As I said, those were Satoshi ideas. So it's not Roger who doesn't get. Those are exactly the original bitcoin ideas.


@_date: 2018-04-25 17:19:48
No. He always wanted to remove the cap.


@_date: 2018-04-25 19:28:37
You don't think increasing the block size was a consensus? What about deploying SegWit, was that consensus?
What about your lie "until Satoshi realized it was an attack vector and fixed it"
@_date: 2018-04-25 01:09:02
It's not Roger who wanted a big block. It's Satoshi and the original Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-20 18:06:57
Its you who should hard-fork, its you who don't believe in bitcoin the way it was designed, its you who want to rewrite the whitepaper, its you who don't believe the true vision of bitcoin, its you who don't believe anymore in the fucking definition of bitcoin: "A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System".
@_date: 2016-10-21 16:05:05
Why is MimbleWimble on topic here? Isnt it an altcoin? /s
@_date: 2017-05-17 14:09:25
ALT COIN
@_date: 2017-07-06 20:51:47
Some people don't want BU, other don't want Core. Easy.
@_date: 2017-07-27 20:12:19
Read the whitepaper, and understand it. If you don't, some people will manipulate your mind and make you think bitcoin is something it is not.
@_date: 2017-07-03 18:00:34
It's really a shame seeing such condescending messages when every now and then we have a system that is over capacity and too slow and expensive to use.
@_date: 2017-07-04 20:12:55
One would follow Satoshis vision, the other would not
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:37:28


Following majority hash rate is a takeover, but following majority of nodes is not? Read the whitepaper..
@_date: 2017-07-12 12:33:17


If miners and nodes don't agree on what rules to follow, who gets to decide? What is proof of work?
@_date: 2015-02-24 16:59:00
If I had bought them at $1000 I would cry
@_date: 2017-06-18 02:01:11
If nodes are the ones who ultimately decide which chain to follow, why have mining in the first place? Let nodes build the ledger themselves
@_date: 2017-06-22 00:15:15
He is obviously saying that the tech in the whitepaper was already capable of handling it.
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:42:28
They actually understands what bitcoin is. That's exactly what Satoshi designed.
@_date: 2017-06-18 01:47:57
Do you know what proof of work means?
@_date: 2016-05-25 19:22:34
It seems obvious to me that plenty of storage is wasted on many HDs around the world. Do you think we should impose a limit on the size of HDs worldwide to try to force everyone to use their capacity more efficiently? This is a small blocker analogy, is you imposing artificially the maximum size of HDs.
Or do you think HDs manufacturers should build HDs the size they want and charge the price they want for the costs they have? This is a big blocker analogy, letting the manufacturers decide what are theirs costs and what prices to charge.
@_date: 2017-06-21 18:57:56
Stop trying to make these convoluted reasoning to make satoshi words fit in your propaganda. You're fooling yourself only.
@_date: 2017-06-21 19:38:58
The whitepaper is Bitcoin bible. You don't have to like or agree with it. You can always create your own altcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-30 14:52:08
Wasn't the original mechanism hash rate?
