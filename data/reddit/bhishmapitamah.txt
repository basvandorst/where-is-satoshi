The futures market was too small to do this. This was/is just another natural thing for BTC to do
@_date: 2018-01-23 09:18:49
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:52:57
Because some people want to have only a certain % of their money as BTC. When you use and rebuy you maintain that % and help your coin get adopted.

What do you think of EOS? The men behind it gave experience with other similar projects and the ICO method looks like a genuine attempt to be fair and avoid rapid price rise. Also, technically I don't know much but it sounds like scaling won't be an issue. I'm worried about how decentralised it will be. What do you think?
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:04:11
It won't break 10,000. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:45:53
This example should make it simpler for you. I have an upper limit of £1000 that I am fine putting into BTC. I want to keep it as an investment so I don't want to buy anything with it. I use cash to buy everything else. What I am saying is that you use £250 worth of BTC to buy stuff you'd buy just using cash and then immediately replace the used amount with a new purchase of BTC. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 08:36:19

relaaaaax, there is no huge dump, unless you talking ´bout....
rememerb the hodl memes, they came into existence for a reason. bitcoin is the one coin that WILL survive even if (and that s a yuuuuge if) all other cryptos die. decentralization was the name of the game, alts made us forget that.

Selling on markets which have a higher price and buying back in from the cheaper places? I've got advice for you..
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:09:52
Use and replace immediately, this way even the volatility doesn't affect you.
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:40:30
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:17:04
Imagine how wide and strong a network would get if they declare they are releasing a only-minning coin (like btc) and miners get free coins. Then make it so as it doesn't become hard to mine like btc is. Err, does something like that exist already? ...can I buy it?
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:01:19
True. All weak attempts just prepare us for better attempts

So you think 2mb will not be enough. Let's forget about how difficult it will be for independent users to run a node and the logarithmic manner in which the nodes will reduce with increase in blocksize. Let's look at miners and what it means to their decentralisation. While the propagation of small blocks is fast, i.e., every miner gets to know a new block approximately at the same time, this is no longer true for large blocks.
Large blocks will take a lot of time to be forwarded to every node in the network (including miners) these miners will be unaware that there is a new block and they'll continue mining on top of the old parent, i.e., they will work on a competitor of the newly found block. This means that they are actively wasting their computational resources on an obsolete solution if the propagating block gets accepted into the blockchain. (And if by chance enough miners do the same obsolete block then congratulations, a new fork is born )
Big miners are likely to have a better connectivity with the Bitcoin network, resulting in them losing less of their computational time due. This in turn puts small miners at a disadvantage since they are now less competitive.
The extreme case would be one strong miner, with close to a majority of the computational resources making such big blocks that everybody else learns about its blocks very late, while it already has spent considerable time finding the followup block.
Basically, individual node runners get reduced and thus lower decentralisation and the same thing occurs with miners. Bitcoin is the best because it is the definition of a trustless system, it is the most decentralised. I agree the fee and slow transaction storm is a horror right now, but the answer is to implement solutions which do not compromise the aim of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-02 09:37:01

I think you should pass and just buy solid coins, bitcoin, factom, decred and some ICO like EOS. Bitcoin fell 15% 3 days back. You know by what some of the new coins and alt-coins fell? ~90%
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:03:13
That's excellent advice. Bitcoin will survive this phase, the question I have is out of the 99.99+% coins that will fail (there being more than a thousand) which other coins have you taken a stake in?
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:04:33
They should, and you should pay them.
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:41:02
We think we fancy

It seems they have plans to implement greg Maxwell s solutions to this. Saw a recent post about it, that monero already did it and now BTC will

Bitfinex has only a 10% stake in tether. Also, how would they influence the price? The market fell more than 60% recently, people took out all their money and nobody said "I can't take money out, no liquidity". So remain calm.

@_date: 2018-01-19 07:57:32
Lol, ok.
@_date: 2018-01-22 10:10:43
Because it wont be decentralised. All these alt-coins today think they are cool cause they are fast and cheap (whic bitcoin has again become), but what they are and cannot become is decentralised, becasue no one is spontanously running nodes. If it isnt decentralised, its not secure, its not irreversible, its not immutable. Its shit.
@_date: 2018-01-24 09:23:59
Cool fact!
@_date: 2018-01-23 08:45:25
Maybe you didn't understand what I said. Or you're a troll. Every alt is down compared to bitcoin means all coins are losing value faster than bitcoin. Exchange you alts for bitcoin if you wanna survive crashes.
@_date: 2018-01-11 10:58:35
That's why you should only use exchanges which use Segwit technology 
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:57:47
THE LINK DOESNT WORK MAN
@_date: 2018-01-03 09:55:10
Nothing is planned or talked about to solve this? Dear friend, really? Bigger blocks will lead to centralisation and the most important feature of bitcoin will be lost. It will be a fast PayPal with bigger blocks, and lightening is almost here. Listen, bitcoin is not a company, the Devs don't have to say anything, you can be a Dev too. If you want to have Devs be answerable to you, then you need to be paying them, and that again becomes centralised. Think about why bitcoin exists, how can it keep existing and not get compromised. Think about the hundreds of coins that exist and why bitcoin is the safest and largest network and how this is what makes it a trustless system, not like centralised or psuedo CEntralized coins. Now, losing the most important feature or having to wait for some genuine problems to get solved in the right manner, what would you choose. Instant gratification ain't always good.
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:08:16
Oh yes, my bad
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:57:36
It blows my mind how many people don't care if their coin is centralised but will dance around if it's got good scaling. Using a 'centralised blockchain' should be on top of the list of oxymorons.
@_date: 2018-01-23 10:54:29
thats good advice and youre right. i mentioned the dominance of segwit and for a few blocks it was at 20% i wonder why its gone back down again

you dont know SHIT about LN.

@_date: 2018-01-24 11:28:16
of course bitcoin comes out on top. when 99.99%+ coins will die you know which will remain? thats right, bitcoin (or did you say dogecoin?)

@_date: 2018-01-23 11:59:41
they are afraid because they are thinking abou tthe the short term, evryone EVERYONE knows the long term prospects are good. They are scared cause the are yet to get in for the techmonology, right now they are here only for the moneez. yeah.
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:47:16
i see i see. i couldnt even entertain the thought that bitcoin wouldnt survive some fud
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:46:44
So you think 2mb is the solution?

*+4 in fact ive already left when i was 3
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:39:27
And banning something they don't like is like banning a certain fad. Who the fuck are they to decide what I want to buy and what I want to sell something for? Doesn't that alone make you want to lodge your protest? And nothing protests better than money. Get in, the future is cheap. But we're cheaper.
@_date: 2018-01-15 10:16:02
Good question, though perhaps it's better suited at the investment subrredit for a proper reply. Also because traditional market analysis has never worked for bitcoin, or any other altcoin.

You've paid the fees forced on you by your exchange as well as because the tx fees are high. Lightening is already here and it's wider implementation will get rid of this. Use exchanges that batch transactions and use segwit, this saves everyone time and money.

No alt will gain over bitcoin in a ~~~bull~~~ bear market. That's because bitcoin is the only true decentralised immutable irreversible cryptocurrency there is. When problems come that's what'll count.

I think we need you to submit a post on the 9th (day before futures starts) telling people about your previous experience and warning them what "pro traders", huge institutional players and deep pockets can do to trigger panic and how US, the people should do. What to expect and how to react. If the futures super short bitcoin and we don't sell, the burnt fingers will learn a valuable lesson. They sure as hell will test the waters this way. Thoughts?

Indeed, if the govs have already gotten databases of who has what and how much of which crypto, then they could well kill the anonymous part of the cryptos? Except perhaps those designed specially with anonymity in mind? I think this could be one result but I am not really convinced that this would work, in sure bitcoin too will come up with layers where it's pseudoanonimity gets turned to absolute anonymity. So basically, no worries :D

@_date: 2017-12-15 21:24:26
Yes, the miners are benefiting, and they always will. And I agree the fees are high and transactions slow. But what I agree far more with is that bcash is not the way I want problems to be solved. Supporting S2X then deciding not to do it...all this by a small group of people. No, fuck that, I'll pay more for a decentralised system that does things proper although slow. I would feel very odd having at the helm one guy, who uses money as a shaming method. Few if any good programmers. I mean cmon

@_date: 2017-12-15 22:41:47
What position of mine do you dispute? Did we even mention fees? Did I say they were very low? Core _is_ bitcoin, bitcoin _will_ change, you cannot call evolution to be the reason why bitcoin is not bitcoin but bcash is. Fees are high, so what, every crypto will have growing pains if they survive long enough. Fees have to go back low, yes, and they will. Singing ethereum? It had its trouble too, with kitties no less. I like ethereum, I like litecoin (now that's a fork) but bcash is just a grab and run attempt.

I am not saying the legitimate tx fee problem should be ignored, just that the issue is artificially exacerbated by proponents of bcash. I am all for waiting for a solution to be implemented, not using a weakness to play the kind of games that are on display.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:47:29
I know. What I said was ver supported s2x and then it being ditched by 5 other people he decided to adopt bcash. And I'm not talking about centralisation of development, because bcash doesn't really have any. I'm talking about node and miner centralisation. How easily bcash tx fees were manipulated to Rogers and jihans end. Yes, client implementations are the same and if somehow bcash were to get the same traffic as bitcoin, it's issues would be the same as bitcoins.

According to various reports, still more surveys are in the process of being sent out to India’s cryptocurrency exchanges, asking about the trading habits of its high-net-worth individuals (HNIs), roughly half a million customers it suspects of failing to pay tax."

You move them so that the coins are "yours", you have to hold your private keys, otherwise the coins and any forked coins will be the exchange's to redeem. You move them to yourself by first making a wallet that you own. Like electrum, then you get yourself some addresses and you send your coin from the exchange to this address that is yours.

Don't condescend. First, I already I know that. Second, proof? Third, the majority hash rate was achieved by manipulating the difficulty of mining bcash which was a rotten Dev job and a rotten thing to do overall, also showing how centralised it's pathway has been. Fourth, bitcoins fees were low too before blocks began filling and five, we'll never know since bcash won't be capable of filling them + how do you know the fees wouldn't be high if bcash had same traffic?

Futures will mean big gains but also huge attempts at shorting and when they sell big to try trigger panic sells (so that they can buy your coins for cheap), what should be done is just buy the coin they try and sell to trigger an avalanche. Nerves of steel, the "pros" are coming.
I can't really say much about other coins, don't go for profits, if you like a coin, buy it and don't try to speculate too much, there is no reason why Wall Street can't learn their lesson @ bitcoin and take it to the moon

Setting a precedent doesn't make ethereum a scam, god, read your own comment. How the fuck is ethereum responsible for someone promising excessive returns to catch greedy shits offguard? Just because you're pro bitcoin doesn't mean you have to be unreasonably biased and short sighted. You make this community look stupid. Stop the ridiculous blaming.
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:24:28
coinbase will put its own tx fees, and they have not added segwit technology yet which was designed by bitcoin develpers to make cheaper transactions and faster. so, 1. write to coinbase to tell them they should implement segwit and 2. you have no option so just send it to bitpay, who have a worse % but if thats the only option..

On a similar note, switch to segwit enabled exchanges, bitstamp is one. They also batch withdrawals making things easier, faster and cheaper for everyone.

Well I agree with you on that. Just like the separation of state and religion (albeit incomplete), we need the separation of state and finance. I will pay my tax and the governments will manage that money responsibly and on a transparent public decentralised blockchain and they will not have any other control over money. Fiat has to go.

Last 8 minutes of this video. Roger calls bitcoin cash a business. He says he is trying to save the world and help the world with his work, referring to bitcoin cash. He says calling bitcoin cash bcash is insulting _his_ projects. Let's even forget about the actions/reactions for a bit.

Bitcoin core is not necessarily a group of developers who have been working on, and own bitcoin since it's inception. It could be a developed deciding to work on it from today and not holding any bitcoins. These people have decided to work on bitcoin instead of any other coin or making an ICO. Also, don't donate money if you don't want to, but be aware of the work, make others aware of the work being put into bitcoin. Bitcoin will quickly lose its no.1 spot if all developers sell their bitcoin and stop working on it, appreciating this doesn't need to take a ton of convincing.

Basically mining bitcoin becomes harder and thus miners get lesser incentive, they mine other altcoins and don't mine bitcoins and thus tx fees, time and backlog goes high leading to people shouting bitcoin is dead/useless synchronised with pumping of altcoins (looking at you, bcash) which is enough FUD to make the trick work once (see the dip of 10 days ago)

@_date: 2017-11-15 22:42:21
That is so true
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:11:12
You guys are crazy, all of you are saying you will not sell any bitcoin till it reaches 1,000,000,000?
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:40:05
No, the bitcoin doesn't really have to drop in price, it could, the upcoming fork and free forkcoin could also mean more people want the extra forkcoin and drive the bitcoin price up. Many ways for it to play out. It's calculated by the market as you might have guessed by what I said above. A worthy coin could get zero market attention and shitcoins could be artificially driven up. You have to decide for yourself and look at what the community says to know if a forkcoin is worth is
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:05:29
That it's bcash but tries to get called bitcoin. Amongst others
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:00:58
Or dip the tip?
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:09:43
Keep your own private keys and Keep them safe. Forks and all will take care of themselves

Nice catch there. A network based on trust suffers deeply by such abuse. If everyone does this, what do you foresee?

Then you are a fool and a greedy one at that to regret doing what you did
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:20:29
Exactly, but too many aggressive noobs to even think that I was sarcastic. No bitcoin cash lover will call it bcash. Except Jihan.

@_date: 2017-11-05 08:31:28
Don't be silly, you are part of the reason bitcoin is where it is today. If people like you didn't spend it and use it and spread it, bitcoin would never have gotten where it is now, a thing to be held. Thanks, don't worry, and buy a little :)
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:34:16
Well it's being worked on!
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:40:44
It was a valid question and I think you got valid replies. You may or may not agree with them though. There are some people who are tired of all the paid trolls that come to this community and raise questions and repeatedly state nonsense to create FUD and so they spontaneously call out ANY question as FUD. You're going to see a lot of such posts in the next 48-72 hours

You'd be surprised, they might not dable in shitposting and memes anymore, so you might see them in bitcoindiscussion or other proper subrredits
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:49:56
I had extra cash and leaving it in a bank was a waste of resources, best investment idea was bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:31:37
Ah, and no hurry, no need to do it before s2x, you'll get your forkcoin as well whenever you do it
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:14:59
Bcash, didn't you see the YouTube interview? 44 minutes long. Just watch the last 5 minutes and you'll know what's up with Mr CEO
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:06:35
Hey, thanks for the excellent explanation. To me, this sounds terrible for bitcoin. This will add crazy volatility to an already volatile asset. On top of this don't you think this will just make unfair manipulation of bitcoin prices simpler and a common occurrence? What do you think? Sounds like this is how markets were when they were born leading to the necessity of regulation and with bitcoin we've come a full circle.
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:59:00
Thanks :) I hope the software engineers are doing just as hard and good a job as you. Kraken is becoming infamous for being laggy and orders not generating.
Good day!
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:30:08
Lol for real?
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:12:34
Indeed. But leaving a bank means being your own bank. Get control of your own private keys. Use 2FA, get hardware wallets and don't go around the internet telling how much you've invested. Careful of phishing attempts and don't reuse addresses. Delete this part which suggests you've invested big.
@_date: 2019-02-19 13:34:27

Umm, why are we getting downvoted?
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:05:07
Nothing like that before the fork
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:45:40
It's called a savings account for a reason Mr troll. I have ethereum too, there's no need to bash bitcoin if you support Eth. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:14:04
Kraken is shit. But that's no news, it's been like that for months, if not years. Orders don't go through, 404 errors and duplicated orders, you name it. Basically,yesterday was like any other day for them. 
Case. The CEO has said that by 2nd week of Dec they will update software and things will be better. So we wait and see, for the one final time. If it shit, me go go.
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:13:10
Yes, let them have bcash as Jihan so vocally wants
@_date: 2017-11-24 12:58:54
It's better than bcash! 8mb blocks! Will all bcash supporters go there now?
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:56:25
I see
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:29:42
I think by then there will be enough services to completely prevent error and death based loss of coins. Too expensive to go that way

It is obvious that bcash is Rogers short term project, he doesn't give a flying fuck about bcash's future as long as he manages to be a CEO . He hasn't thought things out other how to hurt bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:28:31
Very simple, but follow best practices
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:10:16

@_date: 2017-11-02 09:38:27
Depends on the exchange, coinbase took an eternity with bcash, and many didn't give anything for the bitcoin gold fork. Best is to hold the coins yourself.
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:41:42

@_date: 2017-11-14 20:01:34
Well, theoretically a hardfork should take a chunk of bitcoins value depending on how worthy the forked coin is, but it hasn't really gone like that, so basically it is as you say, and people have a name for it, calling it airdropped money and stuff like that :D
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:09:11
You'll regret having said that

You are ill informed. The flak about orders not going through is true. But they have no limit on accepting money? Lie, they have a limit, for every tier. And their support not replying? Untrue, I have made 3-4 tickets and have found problems resolved or explanations given in 24-48 hours. What was your support ticket about? The lag? Then there is no replying that helps. So yeah, their orders software sucks but the rest of what you say is bullshit. 
Also, they are one of the most trustworthy and ethical exchange around, so yeah, your ire about the orders is legit but don't be petty and spout nonsense.

@_date: 2017-11-15 19:07:26
A future won't be secured by that sum. Buy 2 each of bitcoin and ethereum. Store them in a hardware wallet with keys on yourself+wife/trusted person and do this while they are still this cheap, really, will you buy one when the price gets 10k+?
But first, buy bitcoin worth 5 dollars and get comfortable with it. Be proactive, download electrum now. Check out  for succinct technical details you might take time to get to while reading mastering bitcoin, which is an excellent read but too detailed for an assessment.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:21:48
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:20:12
Not really. If you have 1 bitcoin, the after every HARDfork, you will end up with 1 bitcoin + 1 forkcoin. (Like bitcoin+bcash on Aug 1, 2017). So now you can hold your new coin, bcash, or sell it if it is supported by exchanges etc.

None, to be realistic bitcoin isn't yet as mainstream and functional as fiat. But the point is to keep savings in bitcoin and only necessary grocery amounts in fiat.

Kraken wake up
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:17:52
I think so too. I suppose people temporarily sell their Eth to get BTC+forkcoin and then dump forkcoin to get back into Eth and other altcoins that they sold.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:21:27
This. And there would be no risk to your coins as they would be on ledger
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:06:10

Kraken is bad technically right now, but it is the most ethical and trustworthy too. You can really trade on it. But the CEO has said that by the 2nd week of Dec they'll have things fixed and also transfering fiat in and out of kraken is a cakewalk, so I'd wait and see.
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:49:12
@_date: 2017-11-24 13:05:56
It's better than bcash though, but without a millionaire CEO backing it like Roger it's shit, which is what bcash is
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:21:25
That's on sale
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:30:41

@_date: 2017-11-02 16:14:21
Price will dip after fork, but you will lose the forked chain if you buy bitcoin after the fork and not now. So your call, but be quick and keep the private key with yourself

Yeah, also, did you do a SEPA transfer? Since those are the fastest and can take up to 5 working days to process, so perhaps you are still within the time range the warn about.
Back in the earlier days it would be weeks and you didn't even know if the transfer had an error or what :D

If price is the only barometer you use to gauge bitcoin core developers' contribution then you are doing a huge disservice to yourself and to everyone involved. Go to bitcoin.org and see what's up! Tomorrow the price may fall but that doesn't mean the long-term future of bitcoin has taken a hit, that's because the core developers and not improving its price, they are improving the technology! (Although a lot of people are clearly investing only due to the price and the  way it climbs)

Maybe the word you were looking for was comprehension, but you can try convincing yourself that saying perception makes sense, since it's obvious you think you are very articulate.
As for technical analysis, check the website called coindesk, a poor guy called Godbole posts chart analysis articles there everyday, I've read them for the last 6 months, the number of times he was wrong might make you believe TAs actually do work, you just have to turn their conclusions upside down and make decisions based on that.

Fractional reserve is countered by the public ledger nature of bitcoin. They can censor (read steal) your money if they have your private key but they cannot censor transactions as it is a distributed/decentralised ledger. I don't remember your third point, so I'll consider it moot. :D
@_date: 2017-09-02 23:31:49
Im sorry. Heres what i found. Yea their engine is misbehaving badly today. They have done a few things lately to try and make their engine run smoother, mostly in the form of cutting services and making it harder to trade smaller amounts. It seemed to help for a bit... but it looks like the load has caught back up to them.
Not sure how new you are to kraken, but the poor performance of their trading engine has been a known issue for some months now. Supposedly they are working on a new trading engine to handle the increase in volume. Until it is deployed and working as intended expect things to get worse before they get better.
My 'favourite' kraken idiosyncrasy is the 'your order MAY have been executed' error message. From past experience I'd say this means there is a 33% percent change your order went through 33% chance it did not and 33% chance it WILL go through in about 10 minutes. It really helps liven things up, gives the whole experience that 'lottery' feel.

No, first, nobody knows the connection between the famous address and the private key that has the money.

When you wanna buy that emergency 30 day food storage supply pail at overstock (dont know why you wanna buy that) buy bitcoin worth the amount it costs to buy that thing on overstock, and then spend it. Basically you just spent your dollars cuz your 10 BTC are still gonna remain untouched. id suggest buying a little more than you need to buy the products, this way you ¨build¨ your bitcoin store :D cheers!
@_date: 2018-11-04 16:36:24
No, the primary use case wasn't using bitcoin for purchase. It was an investment first and foremost, then when I read and think I understood more I liked how it helped add a much needed facet to current economics. I liked it was independent, homegrown, everyone's and nones's and it's original aims rung with me.
I have never had issues making purchases since I've never used it such. The most I'd done was transfer money to friends via bitcoin.
Making a purchase was a struggle since I wasn't a fan of hotwallets and I had to move it there to do the actual purchase. But much earlier than that, the real struggle was finding places where I could simply use bitcoin, something like Amazon, if it were to accept bitcoin I honest to god would only use it, I can only assume many more exist who think like me. This feeling is shared by most I personally know.
I am quite satisfied with the resources available when I came to know about bitcoin. I wish the real importance of decentralisation were reiterated at various times and made clearer. Security was always grilled into crypto enthusiasts so that was good, and necessary.
The beginning learning experience, not for me but for most people who now already know about bitcoin, albeit via a biased and negative viewpoint, would be necessarily ideological. Abuse of bitcoin, the attacks towards its image and the genuine use cases and potential of the currency need to be the first step and much clearer, now that the mess of skewed interests has planted opinions into people's heads while no one has defended bitcoin at the same time (no leadership and company has its advantages and disadvantages). So, I'd say believing in bitcoin is the hardest part for anyone now. The rest then takes care of itself.
Good luck

Yes, you can still transfer them to the ledger.
Paper wallets are literally just that. You save your private key by writing/printing it out on a paper. This way, there is no copy of the key on any computer/device. The safest way for long term storage of bitcoin. Of course, you should make 2-3 copies of the key, leave one with someone you trust and you can laminate the paper so water damage doesn't occur etc. It is a hassle to then use them though, since you will have to import/scan them onto the ledger any day you want to spend them. Inform yourself and decide what you like best, Ledger is good anyway, but for super long storage I'd use paper wallet(or printed on plastic even) AND the same keys in ledger. Dunno, your call :D
