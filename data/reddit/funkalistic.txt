What you say is true. No one would recognize it since then you're not a true believer. It's called cognitive dissonance.

Ugh "you guys". Sorry, I'm not a part of a camp(other than crypto vs fiat). I'm trying to understand and spread what I read and see. 
Could you please elaborate or provide a link to why this is a bad thing?
Otherwise I'll search for it when I get home.

The thing is that bch is for peer-to-peer transactions, low fees and fast transactions. Btc is slow and expensive to send.
Bch follows bitcoins white paper while btc chose to scale through LN and segwit.
That's why bch claims to be the real bitcoin.

Everyone - call your grandparents! This one have clearly cracked the code!

Ugh. This is not rocket science. It's just putting lines on previous resistance/support.
Don't shame anyone if you don't know what you're talking about.
If you think you need as much knowledge about TA as Kirby to do this, you surely must be James from the watercooler.

1. It's hard to say exactly, there's alot of speculation that CSW, Calvin, jihan &amp; co. is dumping BTC to pump their coins. Meanwhile there's some speculations that  exchanges have pumped  the crypto market with bots and fake volume. (Note that I don't claim this as facts. It's just what I've read through this past month.)
There's ALOT of FUD out there atm, so People get scared and sell.
2. Not to shill another coin but if I understand you  correctly you're talking about something that resembles Veritaseum. (Or the VEAdir trading bot)* Check out reggie Middleton on Youtube if you'd like to know more!
3. Well, there's alot of doubt in the market. Many feel like it's heading towards 1k while others are calling the bottom at 2.5ish or 3k.
I'm really no expert, but this is my understanding of the current market. Take it with a bucket of salt.
Fun to see that an older man like yourself hang out here, best of luck to you!
