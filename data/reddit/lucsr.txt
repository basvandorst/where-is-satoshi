Market fluctuates. To discuss the transaction fee shall be in average term rather than at a specific time spot. See below for better understanding.
Denote the following:
* A is the world population or number of base users
* q is the ratio of preferred transaction fee per second to the BTC balance
* f is the fee per transaction.
* n is the average number of transactions per second for a person
* F the average block fee
* N max number of deals per second for the coin
* T 600 seconds
Empirically the wealth distribution follows exponential distribution. Because the average BTC balance must be 16800000/A, f is of exponential distribution with average mean 16800000q/A/n.
While nAT transactions compete for the block space who has the capacity of NT transactions, F is contributed by the higher-fee NT transactions among the nAT transactions. In other words,
F= NT * E(f | f &gt;=p )
Pr(f &gt;= p ) = NT / nAT = N / nA
E( f | f &gt;= p ) = 16800000q / nA * N / nA * (1 - Ln( N / nA)
with a multiple factor of 1-Ln(N / nA) to the preferred fee and F as a monotonically increasing function of N / nA:
Put into the relevant data and you can read the results.

Long ago I read about something similar at btc-hedge . biz/?page_id=EstimateBlockFee for my first time.  This post is great and points out people shall think "scale" as a better-to-have side effect instead of the goal.  The same reasoning can decide the number of base layer users (an exchange or an LN node or other traditional bankers) conversely (rather than being 8 billion) who may, say, help the 8 billion for daily payment by exchanging bitcoin to other less secured money or tokens.  The block size shall be as large as possible only by the security consideration so that the number of base users can be as more as possible.
Luckily one day tech is so advanced that 8 billion people are covered and no need for the exchange/LN node/banks, who knows.  Or otherwise, we have done at the best as possible.  Either way, bitcoin completes the most important mission: nullify the stealth of the wealth of inflated fiat.

Promote vague/subjective words in rational reasoning will limit the territory of a knowledge.  This happened to Austrian school and prevents its progress for decades; when they start using the words "value" and it can be wording simply as "preference" or "surplus" or "expectation of price in a future", the fuzz starts.  I don't want the same story happen to bitcoin.
Economics never says price should be in term of a typical money.  Marx said the price in term of "human labor hours" for example.  When we talk about the price of any typical stuff in term of money other than X, it is because X has no the "store of value" property or equivalently the purchasing power of the money is more stable than that of X; the information amount to conduct a transaction halves being not like a barter, people can focus on info exchange of the goods/service only.
Based on axiom of purchasing power that one shall pay the same amount of money to boil water decades before and after, the price of a money shall be in term of energy.  One caveat is that energy is such a crucial stuff for the society that many nations have some energy subsidy policy so that USD price in term of kwh may be not 10 if 1 kwh is 0.1 USD and there is a strong subsidy behind it.  The statement that a money price is 10 kwh is pretty much a rephrase of concept of proof-of-work and the demand-supply doctrine where supply curve is horizontal; economics know price in a competitive market is the production marginal cost and this is also why price of a money is so much related to the cost to produce (protect) it.
So, everything is no vague.  People describe typical price in term of money and money price in term of energy.  I believe some advance civilization will describe all price in term of energy simply because energy is the money of the universe.  All famous phrase about money is a rephrase of its physics counterpart.  "you cannot create money from thin air" is simply a rephrase of law of energy conservation for example.  Also, you know precisely it is depreciating USD or appreciating bitcoin if the price of bitcoin in term of USD is getting bigger.

As long as the society can not process huge amount of information, there is always some externality where the need of taxation emerges; people want a road (or want to be covered by a social security) but tend to be freerider who claim don't want to construct the road (or don't want to enjoy the benefit).  Unless there is a information tech which helps block those freeriders, the people as a whole (presented by the president or prime minister) will enforce the taxation.

So, it is equivalent for a group of individuals (the group can have only one individual) crowdfunding a LN hub and earn the channel fee as interest and the interest may be higher if the deals of the users of the LN hub tend to be risky.

 Am I right?
Also.  Let's assume the bitcoin and other coins are already matured away from the early price appreciating stage and therefore remain a stable price.  Given the LN channel fee must be smaller than bitcoin on-chain fee, what is the difference for a user to exchange the bitcoin to a lower price coin (who must be smaller block time or large nominal volume or less mining power) and therefore a lower fee, compared with using LN hub ?

Impressed that an economist claims the idea that money needn't be 'backed' by something while the mainstream economists don't.  But money is really backed by something: proof-of-work.

Assuming 1 kwh is priced at 0.1 USD, then without the caveat of energy subsidy and profit margin of the power plant and energy distribution, 1 USD costs 10 kwh to secure after taking into account of all relevant cost.  Otherwise, say 3 kwh to secure, one producer could scam the user of the USD by 7 kwh per USD.  For all USD, assuming the real term risk-free rate 0.5% and the narrow money volume V, you calculate 10 \* V \* 0.5% to get the overall cost (in term of energy) to secure USD per year.
After that, you get data of all world wide narrow money and get the overall cost to secure current fiat system of the glob.

I don't need the concept of "intrinsic value".  The definition of proof-of-work of a money is "a public understanding or proof about the work to get 1.0 unit of money".  Not everything that exists has proof-of-work.  This is a rare property which contributes to store of value.  If you show me a modern art work, I am not sure it is a kid graffiti or something of painstaking artist work, therefore the modern art work has no proof-of-work property.
Also note that the physical unit for work and energy is the same, joule.  The concept is physical and universal irrelevant to subjective preference.  Just like law of energy conservation, money shall not be created from thin air.  Imposing the purchase power axiom of "a same amount of money shall pay for boiling 100 gram water in a remote past and future", you conclude money is isomorphic to energy.  Sound money does exist; anything with a constant proof-of-work and "many other apparent physical properties we all wish about money" is a sound money with which people won't be "getting rich quick" and lazy because of coin appreciation and won't get robbed (stolen wealth) because of coin depreciation by increasing coin volume.  If someday homosapiens contact E.T. for some transaction, something battery will be the money for the transaction.  By definition, the proof-of-work of one battery is  ideally the energy it contains and everyone can measure it objectively.  In famine out of power, this battery money can even help to feed or warm a person.  In case that there is constant energy inflow, the constant proof-of-work artifact needn't contain energy to be a sound money; it is then an ledger accounting system about energy to help social cooperation.

@_date: 2019-07-02 01:30:23
There are two different questions relevant to this topic.  Question 1 is "how much cost to establish a trust", question 2 is "what kind of energy the miners want to use".  You may be interested in one than the other but allow me some brief answer to each of them.
Question 1.  You seem to think it is possible to establish a trust worth of 10000 USD by the cost of only 100 USD.  It is not.  Imagine the 10000 USD is in a box and you pay a guard to secure it.  If the payoff for the guard is only 100 USD, someone can easily bribe the guard with cost 200 USD and make a profit of 9800 USD.  You might claim there is legal system to help you get the money back, so you realize the cost is not only by the guard but also by other players.  Hypothetically, assuming overall you spend only 6000 USD to secure the 10000 USD trust, there will be inevitable events to lower the value of that 10000 USD to only 6000 USD, be it the judge being bribed or the guard is too tired (you hire only one guard) and take a nap and the thief comes to get the 10000 USD sometimes.  In short, "trust cannot be created from thin air".  Money as the trust tokens used by a cooperative society, the cost of issuing and protecting of the tokens shall be the same as what it costs.  In fact, by axiom of purchasing power that one shall pay the same amount of money to boil water in 100 years ago and after, sound money is like an energy battery and you cannot charge a 10000 kwh battery only by 6000 kwh energy.  This addresses to your 5th argument.
Question 2.  You are correct that miners are about to earn the most money and not to save the planet.  Miners, being private and selfish individuals everywhere, want free and abundant energy to do the mining.  In this regard, they may choose Sun light (everyone can get the Sun light) or the existing (wasted) energy generation surplus due to mismatch of production and consumption.  The case of a dam or a gas mine is far away and the electricity grid is not ready enough.  You could still argue that Sun light to the underlying grass is blocked by the solar panels, though.  In this sense, no energy is "good".  But sustainable energy definition, it means there is no environmental materials composition change while in the energy production operation, not energy without any damage even in the construction stage.  One major reason for centralized fossil energy generation is that people don't have enough incentive to generate the energy locally with the Sun.

A question that helps you to think it over.
At year 2200, humans start migration to another planet with a giant spaceship. It takes possible hundred years in the spaceship therefore a sustainable economy is established.  The money of the economy is gold and from time to time recycled gold are produced from electronic waste or whatever containing gold at the cost that 1g new gold requires 100 joule. You agree with me a service that I pay you 10g gold and you charge for me a big battery.  Now, the recycling technology advances.  With the new tech, we human can get 1g gold by 50 joule.  My question to you is "are you willing to do the same deal with me by 10g gold ?" even all the gold physical properties remain.

KT/F where:
* K is global energy power input (hashing energy input of miner can be read in the product spec, cooling energy input needs some interviews with miners) for mining
* T is 600
* F is average block fee in term of coin
Don't have block reward in the equation not because today is year 2140 but because the long term average block reward is zero and "2x for investment gain in 4 years because of halving" is not logical in eyes of finance.
But, people are not much logic however the world still needs to obey physics.  Therefore we see miners keep jumping in and buyers in a wide range of time interval get rich; if all miners follow the pricing and not short-sighted for block reward since today, only the buyers before today get rich and bitcoin becomes a currency if scaling tech is ready .  Update the calculation as K and F change due to:
* K increase or decrease. miners jumping, new mining rig competition, or miners ban
* F decrease or increase.  all alive coins are held in mass thanks to mass adoption or small population.
The price in term of energy and price in term of fiat are related by fiat fee per 1.0 kwh.

What I mentioned in 3 is to demonstrate the meaning of no variance, not a way to quantify "how fat is the fat tail?". It is difficult to spot fat tail in 4 or in a typical graph of probability density/accumulated probability with x-axis being the realization samples. As mentioned in that twit, a typical graph to spot fat tail is Ln(Prob(X &gt; x)) against Ln(x) (or Ln(Prob(X &lt; x)) against Ln(-x) ) if you care the right (or left) fat tail and regress the data over a threshold; Ln(Prob(X &gt; x)) = c1 - c2 \* Ln(x) is equivalent to Prob(X &gt; x) = C1 \* x \^ -C2. When C2 &lt; 2, you get the fat tail. In the sense of relocation and rescale, when C2 &gt;= 2, the sum of iid random variables will approach the stable distribution with alpha = 2, aka Normal distribution and Central Limit Theorem. When C2 &lt; 2, the sum of iid random variables will approach stable distribution with alpha = C2. Note that when C1 &lt; 1, the tail is so fat that people shall not even apply Law of Large Numbers.

\&gt; Don't pay more than a couple percent over the cost of mining for 1 btc
This statement is not precise. To conduct a view-neutral argument, let's not speculate on any change of context except time is moving forward; no new miners, no jurisdiction blocking, ...etc.  Because the halving, the cost of mining for 1 bitcoin depends on the time horizon a miner plans for his operation; the average block reward in the cost of mining calculation could be (a) 12.5 if the miner plans to mine till 2020 only, or (b) it could be lower as 5.290556 if the miner plans to mine till current block height reaches current height plus 630000, or (c) it could be 0 if the miner plans to mine always.  As you can see, cost done by (a) &lt;&lt; cost done by (b) &lt;&lt; cost done by (c).  Therefore, let's say current price is much higher than the cost via (a) and around the cost via (b), the profit you claim irrational is in fact a reserve for the mining loss of coming years which the miner will not treat as profit in his own accounting and go for a lambo.
Three numbers, which one is correct? To get the (rationally) correct answer, it must follow that no miners and investors could have a capital gain.  The price done by (c) is the correct number and there are different plan horizon miners such that the overall mining power reduces gradually to the forever-plan miners’ mining power and the price is around the cost done by (c) all the time.
After the above is understood, then people can start speculate the non-view-neutral context.  It is not rational to assume all people are well-trained rational and I wonder how many counts of “4-years cycle boom” needs to teach the people.

The word "volatility" is used in realm of variance existence.  I would not use the wording "much volatile".  If you like to have a good sense about it, you can conduct the experiment this way by yourself:
1. Define the variance statistic V(N) as Sum(X\_i - average(X\_i))\^2/(N-1).  This is always a number for whatever finite integer N.
2. Choose a probability distribution of no variance and start to simulate realization samples.
3. Graph the V(N) against N
4. Graph the X\_N against N
You may feel that the graph of 4 is not that volatile however the graph of 3 becomes larger and larger whenever a "fat tail" event happens.

\&gt; The problem with this chain of logic is that 1/2 of bitcoin was mined at or before $50, and there's really no way of knowing if the bitcoin you're purchasing was mined at $50, or mined at $15,000
I would say most miners of early days never plan a business for multiple halving; if it was the case that all miners would never plan after the first halving, then the rational price would be zero (because the mining power of forever-horizon miners is zero) as no investor would buy to hold will-be-zero coin. The coin price is about future cost expectation, not the past realization, so the 1 coin cost of those early miners is irrelevant. I think the logic is sound and the only unknown number is the forever-horizon miners' mining power. I could regress the historical mining power data to have a guess but the data never shows this no-arbitrage pattern, therefore the most educative guess of it is the overall current mining power and treat current price as highly underestimate.
Typically (let's rule out the thief), miner's coin selling price is the first price for a coin which the following investors of the coin will trade around. If (1) price higher and new short-horizon miners enters or (2) price sidewalk and short-horizon miners exit, so that the no-arbitrage pattern shows up, then the price would be much stable because it is rationally correct.

In term of money value, any fork might not be that horrible.  Suppose you have a crypto currency of 100 notional and the current price is A and a fork happens.  Among the whole energy for a pre-fork block, suppose that fork1 has p of it and fork2 has 1-p of it simply due to miners choice.  Then you are in fact get two crypto currencies and the old currency is history, each with 100 notional and the currency on fork1 will have price Ap and the currency on fork2 will have price A(1-p).  Summing values together, you still have 100A.
However, beyond computer science or software arch,  being an old man and see too much about world, I would say "absolute power absolute corruption" and people shall take a look at the Satoshi message on the genesis block to think deeply in addition why we are here.

once again, it shows that a sole understanding of technology without physics and (non mainstream) economics is never good to bitcoin. The trust and the value come from the proof-of-work by which the public can understand no other ways to establish or produce. By meaning "work", it means the definition in physics, not a casual meaning. By proof-of-work, the value of 1 gram gold is the Joules number necessary for the digging, the proof-of-work of 1 BTC is the (Joules number of 10 minutes electricity of bitcoin network) / (12.5 + fee in a block). You can never convince someone to do a job for you by 1 BTC where the job overall demands his 30M Joule energy while 1 BTC is less than 30M Joule. You can never save 30M Joule (with your hard working) for personal demands years later while 1 BTC is less than 30M Joule.
The proposed approach will destroy the numerator and therefore destroy bitcoin. If you really want a greener money, try to convince the central banks to peg their fiat currencies volume with the volume of bitcoin then the fiat currency is then a real money and very green, a.k.a, a light coin something.
PS, 30M Joule is the energy (estimated by the electricity bill) to produce 1 USD if USA stop printing new money. Details see some posts in btc-hedge.biz

for "pay from multisig address" transaction, the fund can not be in one of your typical address, you (and possible all involved users) need to move fund to the multisig address first away from your (and possible their) typical address; effectively, this fund belongs to no ones.  you can not start a "pay from multisig address" transaction while there is no fund in the multisig address.
To prepare "pay from multisig address transaction", one needs the business knowledge to prepare about the payment.  And I think a generic web service may not know this detail simply because the service provider is "generic" as your hope and not dedicate to any specific business.  Therefore, it is always one of the users involved in this multisig address to prepare this "pay from multisig address transaction" to be economical design in bitcoin.

People in the cryptography currency eco debate about this issue again and again. On one hand people want the cryptography currency to be a trustful store of value, on the other hand they want it to be a vehicle of all transactions of typical daily life. This conflict leaded to the "civil war" of bitcoin in 2015. However, it can be avoid if people have the following understanding. Once again, it shows that a sole understanding of computer science without physics and some (non mainstream) economics is never good to cryptography currency.
Since real money in fact represents energy (to boil 100 gram water requires the same energy amount thousand years ago and after but not the same "money" amount due to inflation), we can reason in energy term to have a clear whole picture. Suppose these notations:
* K denotes the energy power for a block
* F denotes the fee coins in a block
* N denotes the average transaction numbers per unit of time
* T denotes the average time interval for a block
* D denotes the average size of a transaction
* R denotes the number of blocks so that the transaction is highly confident not able to reverse.
Therefore, take BTC in 2015 as example:
* the energy for a block is KT
* the (value) energy of 1 BTC is KT / (25+F) which shall results in energy arbitrage if it differs a lot from the market price
* the average transaction fee energy is KF / (25+F) / N which is (KT-25KT / (25+F)) / N / T. For example, suppose people have a typical transaction fee of 0.05 USD in their minds, then equivalently people are in fact having a typical transaction fee of 0.05 / 0.15 * 3600000 Joule where 0.15 USD is the electricity price of 1 kwh. In other words, to express people's expecting fee in real term, it is 1.2M Joule for a typical transaction fee
* the energy to guard the trust is KTR which is huge in real term and that is why we trust the results deeply buried in the blockchain
* the block size is roughly NTD
We know that the new mined coins (if any) and F is to support the block generators' energy activity. We also know that NTD shall be equal to some lower percentile (not higher percentile like top 1) of network propagation speed otherwise we are going for a centralized high-speed-connected block generators and it will be simpler and better by using a centralized Oracle(tm) database to keep people's money amount. So you can treat NTD as a constant about the current internet; you may think it 2M or 20M or whatever you justify by some reports from ISP.  But the following arguments remain. To get cheap fee, there is one way people can do by simply put F=0. But there are only NT transactions for a block and block generators will include higher fee transactions and people are facing prisoner-dilemma and therefore this approach is impractical. Therefore we rule out the possibility of lowering fee by lowering F. Further, the 25 will eventually become zero and the transaction fee energy will be simply K / N which is irrelevant to F. Therefore, the only way to lower the transaction fee is to increase N or decrease K. For K, it can not grow always, it must be stable sometime in the future because the energy influx to the Earth is constant and we don't expect block generating is the major activity demanding energy on Earth.
So many what-if:
* T can be smaller to have same size block and allow more transaction, but then K needs to be larger to guard the value and R needs to be larger to guard the trust; for example, litecoin must be worthless than bitcoin and its R must be larger than 6 which is BTC's R.
* ...
Given NTD and K are bounded. Just playing the formula around and an elementary math can understand that it is impossible for any specific cryptography currency to have the following goals at the same time:
* it is valuable and trustful: larger and larger KT / (25+F) and KTR
* it is high throughput and low fee: larger and larger N and lower KF / (25+F) / N
Also, after all the 21M coins are mined, the value of 1 BTC is KT/F therefore the only way to cope with economic growth (if any) is a bigger and bigger KT/F, meaning, the transaction fee F will be lower and lower in nominal term and constant K/N in real term. In fact, at that time, all prices shall be lower in term of BTC and constant in real (energy) term.
We can imagine a counter part where we use gold (BTC) and the paper money (LTC). A fast food restaurant hardly accepts gold for transactions, but the staff always finds some counterfeit currency money in monthly revenue review and this is the unavoidable evil to have a large throughput.
"Different cryptography currencies of different goals" is the only way to go. What people shall really debate is the goal. If people emphasize the first (or the second) goal for a specific cryptography currency, then there must be some other cryptography currency emerging to fill the goal left behind and there are always the needs to exchange the two cryptography currencies occasionally.
so, which goal you want for XXX and YYY ?  where XXX and YYY stands for the symbols of two cryptocurrency

Then that RSS mechanism seems to serve this generic purpose in a working way; mayby ugly in UI, i laughed when i saw its google form.
Preparing the redeem script is easy (any one collects the public keys can do this); signing some message and sending it to the redeem script preparer is sufficient for this; that google form/RSS does this.  For "pay from multisig address transaction", it is wild to handle the "state" of the transaction; after one party prepares this payment by an agreement or contract whatever, some party may decline to sign and this is where some counter party risk might emerge and the transaction is technically allowed to never broadcast; if simply omit this risk, then the whole show looks funny because we can argue that these users, at the first place, can simply wire their money to user1 and user1 will pay the whole money eventually for the planned transaction.

Hash rate is a proxy of mining cost but not always.  Say, a new mining rig with 2x hash per second per Joule is introduced, and let's consider following cases.
Case 1, new miners start mining with the new rigs.  Then the global mining cost per coin increases as well as the global hash rate increases.
Case 2, all old (greedy) miners replace their old rigs with the new ones at the same electricity bill.  Then the global hash rate 2x but the cost per coin remains the same.
Case 3, all old (conservative) miners replace their old rigs with the new ones at the same hash rate and save the electricity bill 0.5x.  Then the cost per coin 1/2x.
In between, it is possible the global hash rate 1.5x and the cost per coin decreases with the new rigs.
Last of all, an estimation of cost per coin is related to the time horizon of the miners in addition to the global hash rate.  A miner who plans to run 50 years business has a much higher cost per coin (not talking about the fiat's depreciation in 50 years) than a miner who only plans to run till the coming halving.

After reading the whole, I think the wording of "privately issued" of the author is somewhat misleading.  What he means is "money issued by private sector not obeying the property that the value it presents matches the cost to issue" in which sense any issuer, central banks or the said private households, can easily bail the failing lending since they can create a coin representing 10 dollars but at the cost of 2 dollars.  The property is just a rephrase of proof-of-work.
For the money (bitcoin, battery, gold, ...etc.) with the proof-of-work property, suppose Alice lends to Bob then:
Case 1, Bob is a person who never defaults.  The lending interest rate is the time-preference rate of Alice which Alice considers her own risk after setting aside the money.
Case 2, Bob has some probability of default.  In addition to the time preference, the lending rate will be the risk premium to offset the loss of the principal.
Over all, it means a lending of the money of this desired property cannot on-average make Alice more money.  Hence, the wealth inequality is lessened that otherwise the case of money with bail by printing more money where the lenders get higher percentage of money stash gradually.  Many early bitcoiners started some "blockchain investment hype" and lose money to Cindy, David, ... (they are the contractors of Bob); this is good in the global view in regard with wealth equality.

The paths shall represent personal economic activity interest rather than the block chains ID and BIP44 is not necessary.  For example, before 2017 bitcoin split, Joe may define the path m/12345 to represent bitcoin stuff and all the key pairs and addresses derived from a path starting with m/12345 are all about bitcoin.  Then the 2017 split occurred and Joe is facing two chains, one is named bitcoin core chain and the other is named bitcoin cash chain.  To avoid address confusing, in addition to the path m/12345 now represents the coins recorded in both the chains, Joe can then use path m/12300 to represent coins recorded in only bitcoin core chain stuff and path m/12399 to represent coins recorded in only bitcoin cash chain stuff.  Therefore, there is no way to lose the fund or mix coins of different price or tricked by currency code scammers after the split because the keys/address of the three currencies are disjoint: bitcoin by m/12345 as before, bitcoin core by m/12300, bitcoin cash by m/12399.

Even assuming the same mining energy power across all eras, the production cost does not double at every halving.  Say, the block fee is 1.5, then the era-specific production cost is x ( 12.5 + 1.5 ) / ( 6.25 + 1.5 ) this time, approximately 1.8 and smaller and smaller to 1.0 in the future halvings.

I think people running nodes can conclude their wishful blocksize or internet capacity by linking their wishful price/fee ratio.

For example, given the transaction size D 500 bytes, block fee 1.5 coin and wish a fee of 0.75 USD while price 4000 USD, the total block size is 3.81 MB and the internet capability shall be 5.08 M per second.

This explanation is lively.  Love it.  I think too the correct way to distribute the new money is proportional to one's cash and saving account (no checking account or risk-premium-earning account).  Then it is mathematically the same as no need to increase the money volume and the coin is in fact appreciating, therefore print-new-money to foster economy growth is not necessary.  
Btw, the total energy people can harvest on Earth (eventually sourced from the Sun if using only sustainable energy) and the energy efficiency technology may not improve 2\~3% per year.  Therefore, to expect a real-term economic growth to be 2\~3% per year may be irrational.

It seems to me that you confuse (1) the conditional probability of the block time if a block is not found at time 3 minute with (2) the probability of the block time at time 0.  Or I confuse your 3 minute context.
Let T be of exponential distribution with average 10 minutes.  For (1), the block time is 3 + T.  For (2), the block time is T.  In a sense, the 1.5 is to cover the coming T.
For the plain vanilla miner, you understand why the additional fee is required.  For your miner, with capacity issue (based on block size data, this is true) it is the same as the plain miner.  As mentioned, the block time of your miner at time 0 is still T; no need for "software algorithm forces compliance", the Pr(T1&gt;1) * Pr(T2&gt;1) * Pr(T3&gt;1) * Pr(T4=0.2) =0.1 * exp( -3.2/10 ) stuff.
Put another way in the 1 TX per minute simulation, let's bypass capacity issue and this is a perpetual mining business where P = K * 10 / 1.5 instead of P = K * 10 / (12.5 + 1.5).  For a block, your block revenue is 0.15 * T coin and your cost is 0.15 * T coin and there is no need for additional fee for that 3 (or 15 if the simulation is that the block is not found at time 15 minute then double spend) minute kwh.
Precisely speaking, you still need a tiny additional fee 0.15 for your miner but I pardon what you state because it can be obliviated in the simulation of 1 TX per 0.001 minute where the additional fee is 1.5/ (1000 * 10).

Ha! So you finally understand our math and all my explanation to your questions?  =)




Neh.  A fork or a drastically change of infrastructure is not required.  Because of that equation of C1(t) and C2(t), the market force will eventually have these two numbers IF there is a market.  Being a serious market, the producers are always serious about the cost.  And as mentioned, my conjecture is that it will be C1(t) = C2(t) = t; psychologically (not mathematically), it is hard to practice that TX1 has been in the block template for 300 minutes and a block is not found yet but a TX2 needs no additional compensation.  That said, currently miners are not mature enough in many ways and capital gain/loss eclipses everything and is much much influential than franchise gain/loss in the speculation reality.


If you carefully follow this comment thread, you know it is false too.  Recall the 10000-bitcoin pizza case (or the 6-seconds block case where TX1 of 1.0 bitcoin) and it is easy to convince miners to trash the blocks (of TX1) they have mined.  10000 bitcoin means a double spending budget for 10000 / (50 + 1.5) *10 minutes.  Without modifying the software, there is an API in the bitcoin software (undocumented, though) to mark a specific block invalid and force the growing of a new chain.

Here "honesty" is in the sense that a double spender and you cannot conduct the double-spending business smoothly/honestly unless there is clear advertisement/instruction.


This is not what I meant.  What I meant is that to answer the necessary compensation cost problem you need to take into account the two scenarios simultaneously because you cannot foresee the coming scenario, rather than you focus on one single scenario only (DEF2).  You need to think DEF1, not DEF2 only, to have the equation.


That equation is the result of DEF1, not related to "that particular type of double spend" only.


As mentioned, economics of cryptocurrency is not widely understood.  The problem RBF likes to solve is really not a computer/technical problem.  That said, we have been focusing on mining cost mostly and it is mining nodes' business to recognize other cost; maybe it is not free to park a TX in mempool neither (search "auxiliary" in the comment thread).

If you follow the topic here in our comment thread closely, remember the 10000-bitcoin pizza?  Economically I and all the merchants who are afraid to be double spent will not define "inclusion in a block" as "confirm".  Instead, it would fit in the daily life experience with definition of "confirm" as "safe to deliver the pizza" not necessarily "inclusion in a block".  Recall the BTG reorg?  It is the wrong "confirm" definition that Bittrex lost huge money.


Lose no future expected mining time but lost a past mining time about TX1 in the sense of compensation1.  Don't you see you don't have the commitment to replace TX1 with TX2 while the double spender insists you do have a block of TX2 rather than TX1?  Also, your behavior is described in "adopt DEF2 and compensation2" already where C(t) is zero.  But to honor the double spender's intention, you must come to "DEF1 and compensation2" and therefore t = Pr[T&lt;t] * C1(t) + Pr[T&gt;=t] * C2(t) where you can set C2(t) arbitrarily (be it t/2 or 0 or whatever) as long as this equation holds; this calculation of C2(t) has nothing to do with the calculation of C(t) in "DEF2 and compensation2" - totally different math equation.


I have provided you all the required math.  You can conclude C(t), C1(t), C2(t) in DEF1 already.  You can even conclude your C(t) in DEF2 if the distribution is not exponential.  An analogy.  If you insist you have a theory (with tons of strange vocabularies) proving there are finite prime numbers and I have proved to you by another simple theory that there are infinite prime numbers and you realize my prof too, I don't bother to debug where your theory goes wrong.


"0-conf TX", as your definition, corresponds to DEF2 or compensation1.  DEF2 is not merchant-interested while "instant TX" is much merchant-interested because the double spender wants a commitment not a contingency.  You can derive everything about DEF2, though.  While we both already agree that C(t) in DEF2 is zero in exponential distribution, what else do we need to argue about DEF2?
You just cannot use DEF2 as the base of the pricing for that double spend commitment.  You need compensation1 and DEF1 as the base to reach merchant-interested conclusion.


What I mean by "remine" is the mining task after the block template changes, nothing to do with a block is found or not.  Remember the 4 (search "context" in the comment thread)?  The mining task is launched at every minute and the block template changes at every minute, then I say "remine at every minute".  On the other hand, if the block template is fixed at minute 0 and never changes and I simulate T0, T1, T2, T3....Tn being T0,...Tn-1 &gt;=1 and Tn &lt; 1, then I do not say "remine at every minute".

Whatever the rhetorical wording is irrelevant.  Forget about all cliche, can't you just honestly publish an advertisement and put the C1(3) and C2(3) number within:
"If I have committed my mining work for your TX1 for three minutes already, I will accept your TX2 to replace TX1 if you pay C1(3) in addition and a block is already found during the 3 minutes" and "If I have committed my mining work for your TX1 for three minutes already, I will accept your TX2 to replace TX1 if you pay C2(3) in addition and a block is not found during the 3 minutes".  You cannot avoid either one like bury your head in the sand because both are likely to happen.
You can put C1(3) and C2(3) whatever you prefer (even zero) and we have discussed all the aftermath already in the comment thread.

Isn't it because they expect much help will come from big government's welfare program (which is highly possible financed by debt)?  Just like kids never grow up until they finance their own lives.  I visit two countries of drastically different culture; one is with many homeless people and the other is not and the difference I observe is that the latter has much less welfare.


Ha!  Quite true.  But I tend to think it is the wealth transfer from a group of people to another group of people.   Let's classify consumption into two categories: normal being financed by saving and abnormal being financed by debt.  Being a transfer, the normal consumption per capita may remain the same level unless energy/resource is much more at that moon time as well.  I think you also agree that the level of abnormal consumption per capita will be lower with a non-depreciating currency.  Combine both, the overall consumption per capita may be lower slightly.


I tend to think wealth shall not increase indefinitely.  The reason is as below.  By the axiom of purchasing power of sound money that one shall pay the same amount of money to boil water long before and after, therefore sound money in fact represents energy.  Where does energy come from?  the solar power for most part of sustainable energy (be it PV or hydro or wind tuebine) and the fossil which is in a sense the energy storage of ancient solar power.  It means human and nature share at most a finite budget of 342.5W per meter^2 if with only sustainable energy.  It may be abundant or not, but it is a bound.  Alternatively, running the risk of fossil energy or inventing fusion energy may be welcomed by people.
I used to read about a fiction about future bitcoin world here in this sub which I think not unlikely.  The fiction goes like this.  The world is much simpler and the states are much smaller and the energy budget is much lower than what 2020(?) USA people enjoy but higher than the 2020 world average due to the sustainable energy deployment thanks to the greed for the mining for decades and unemployed after many halvings.  The moon time is not really moon though it is 10M(?) USD per coin.  The fact is that the coin in real energy term is lower than it is in 2060(?) and the USD in real energy term is tiny.  The demand for trust, aka mining cost, costs the same about 1% of available energy like before, but it is smaller due to the overall energy budget is no longer supported by fossil.  People survive the climate change ironically because they stop their over-consumption and save in bitcoin and hope for the lambo.  But it turns out no lambo neither and people gradually realize the survival is the lambo itself.  In short, a lower consumption scenario.

It is not derailing.  That is why I rather use the wording "instant TX" than "0-conf".  You agree the math t = Pr[T&lt;t] * C1(t) + Pr[T&gt;=t] * C2(t) then you agree you need the C1(t) and C2(t) simultaneously to justify both; you only publish C2(t) to be tiny zero and it is not enough.  You simply insist the Earth is flat then how can it be possible to convince you are wrong about it in the first place? the "0-conf" concept is the new flat Earth and blind you to see the real problem and the whole picture.  All you shall concern is the cost of a double spender's instant TX, plain and simple and asked by a typical average Joe without knowing any detail about block chain.


Because TX2 is **defined** to be the correct one and TX1 and TX2 **cannot** be both recorded in block chain.  Therefore any committed cost about TX1 is wasted.


The software is to equate the empirical average to the theoretical expectation, not to equate the empirical most likely to the theoretical most likely.  You are really off in probability math.  Can you hire a math guy to coach you?

Typically, that 99.999999% of work is not wasted because the "constantly dropping transactions and adding new ones" does not introduce conflict TX aka the TX1 and the TX2 in the comment thread; they drop a TXa because the block template is full and another TXb with higher fee appears, the work about TXa is not wasted because there is no conflict and miners will include TXa later and both TXa and TXb are recorded in block chain (be it in the same block (because possibly a new found block arrives and releases 90% of the block template except TXb so that TXa can be included again) or not).  Hypothetically, if the block chain would be not about cash flow ledger but solely a meaningless memo, the TX1 and TX2 could then be both recorded as well and the work would not be wasted.

All ideal sound money is isomorphic to energy by the concept of proof-of-work where "work" refers to physical energy work.  Let's let alone other irrelevant requirements about money in this comment thread such as divisibility or fungibility or … etc.  There are two cases about the proof-of-work.
case I, it is indeed a work to store energy, effectively same as spending an amount of work to charge a battery.  Then this kind of money can even be used in famine, to serve the money holder or to move another person to work for the money giver.  Example: the bread, the honey.
case II, the amount of work people spend to get this money is not to store the work into the money but the amount of work is widely understood by the people.  Example: rare shell, gold.  This kind of money cannot be used in famine, but in ordinary days as long as people have no doubt the amount of work to attack/fake the money, it can move people to work for the money giver.  Rare shell and gold contain no the energy work to get it but it served as money for people before.   Their roles as money have little to do with utility (ancient people shall prefer a bigger shell to serve as dinner bowl and have no idea about gold's electricity conductivity).  Note that not all goods have the property of "the work is widely understood by the people", or economically speaking, not all goods have a constant marginal cost in real (energy) term.  This property only happens to scarce goods by the mathematical law of central limit theorem and that is why all case II money is traditionally something scarce.
@_date: 2018-06-26 05:27:21
By axiom of purchasing power that an ideal sound money shall be able to pay the same amount of money to heat a glass of water in a remote past or future and by the middle school physics about specific heat, one unit of money shall represent a constant amount of energy.
Therefore, by the existence of energy arbitrage, it is not justified when 1.0 coin represents 1000 joules and 1.0 coin costs 500 joules or 2000 joules to produce.
Money is not like typical goods.  If you really prefer reasoning money in goods' supply demand doctrine, it is noted that an ideal money has a global understanding of its production cost in real term, aka a horizontal supply curve.  That said, currently bitcoin is not money at all and it is a money-purpose asset who is still on the journey to find its long-term production cost.

You can think it as electricity bill inbetween TX1 and TX2 for the time being.  The word "work" in the concept of proof-of-work is not really hash amount (for example, as the rig efficiency doubles and so does the hash amount, the trust/security/proof-of-work to a blockchain remains intact) but the same concept of the work in the physics (the dimension unit of kwh or joule) which you always commit the same energy amount to boil water like paying the same bill amount in sound money.


Why stopped there?  It is simple.  Say, a miner wants to rollback his TX which is 10 blocks deep, and the electricity amount he needs to do this task is easy if he can afford it because he is astronomically wealthy; logically it is the same as mining attack although all other TXs will be recorded as well in new blocks.  I am saying "affordable", not saying this task is rational.  This task is rational only if that TX involves more than 140 ( =(12.5+1.5) * 10 ) bitcoin.


The economics of rewriting blocks is the same as accepting 0-conf TX, all about the cost is beyond rationally affordable or not.  Continue that thread and you see the "600 seconds chef" example.

With the bottom up approach, in traditional banking system there are too many details accounting for the energy consumption.  A top down approach will be more applicable.
First, a researcher shall equip himself with some theoretical knowledge that in equilibrium P=K/qV where P is the energy-termed price of the money and q is the time preference and V is the money volume and K is the energy power.
Second, survey the data for P, V, q then gets the K by K=qPV.
For example, suppose the worldwide fiat base money plus gold are the only commodity for demand of trust and has market capacity PV as 1.53E+13 USD (count only the base money because much amount in broad money is in fact loan notional, not money), the q is 0.005 annually, the 1 kwh is 0.1 USD, worldwide energy consumption is 5.5588E+20 joule per year, then K shall be 2.7540E+18 joule per year and accounts for 0.495&amp; of worldwide energy consumption.

Where in that simulation do you have question?  I hope you can address where you don't understand and allow my answer.  Otherwise, I feel like a round-earth preacher in 15th century.
Mayby I shall start to address your "Miners don't create a static block template and hash on it until a block is found. It's constantly changing. ".   Remember there is block capacity.   When block is utilized, miners cannot have additional fee from transactions happened during that 300 seconds, the jump caused by fee at t+300+T is 1.5 bitcoin, not 1.5 +0.75 bitcoin.   Pretty much like the case that, to rewrite 10 blocks whose size is 1M each, a miner cannot mine a new single block of 10M; in your mind set, you collect all the TXs in the 10 blocks and replace TX1 (a 10 blocks deep) with TX2 and put all in a single block so that you only commit 10 minutes kwh rather than 100 minutes kwh.
Here is the pseudo code of your miner so that you can simulate where 1 TX is put into memory pool at time 0, 1, 2, .... minute and the seats capacity of a block is only 10 TXs.  You can see how the "full capacity" is reached.  When reached, that any TX is introduced into the block seats must be that a TX is out from the block seats.  In short, 1.5 fee only and someone must pay for that 300 seconds kwh.
The bottom lines are:
* Users won't double spend by the compensation pricing table (whatever rational to have that table is not the users' interest)
* Business cost is irrelevant to revenue.  When a block is not found at 600 seconds and a miner receives double-spent TX2, the miner can not be drastically different at the cost due to the luck of a block is found at 600 seconds (you agree there is a compensation of 14 bitcoin) or not (you think the compensation is zero).

It was a long way in  the comment thread that you finally realized "why 10 not 7" and now you are trying to cover your position by irrelevance again.
If your C2(t) is such that t &gt; Pr[T&lt;t] * C1(t) + Pr[T&gt;=t] * C2(t), then your TX2 doesn't pay more enough.  Simulate for your financial sake.
You get a point that a specific arrangement of C1(t) and C2(t) is not anti-fragile in the sense that it depends much on the assumed distribution.  This is indeed why people facing situations like this will evolve to have the anti-fragile setting C1(t) = C2(t) = t psychologically which manifests compensation1 and DEF1.

If the market is efficient then the mining energy power time series after rig efficiency adjustment shall have the arbitrage-free pattern.  It is not however, meaning it is not completely "price-in" yet.
Volatility is due to wide range of unit cost recognized by the miners.  Say, assuming dollar never depreciates, the unit price of apples is $1 this year and knowingly increases one dollar every year up to 10th year and remains $10 afterward.  A 1-year farmer would recognize the unit cost at $1, a 3-year farmer would recognize the unit cost at $2 treating the $1 ( = 2 - 1 ) as reserve which offsets the higher cost in a future than as profit of year 1st.  A 1000-year farmer would recognize the unit cost at $10 practically.  As the composition of farmers changes, the shape of the supply curve changes as well with steep/flat slope and lower bound $1 and upper bound $10.

I totally understand what you mean by "It's constantly changing" and "random nature of mining" but it is irrelevant.  It doesn't matter an irrelevant transaction enters the block template at a later timestamp.
Do you try a simulation spreadsheet already?  It is simple.  Allow me to recap as below:
* x-axis is time, y-axis is your money
* double spend at 300 seconds with X additional satoshi compensation if a block is not found yet. Set X=0 to see your path to go broke:
* assume mining cost 0.1 per second aka per 1.0 bitcoin P = 60/(12.5+1.5), B(t) the balance at time t, B(0)=1000
* rand() returns uniform 01 random variable, u
* -600 * Ln(1-u) returns exponential random variable, T
* if T&lt;300, draw a line from (t, B(t)) to (t+T, B(t) - 0.1 * T) and a jump from (t+T, B(t) - 0.1 * T) to (t+T, B(t) - 0.1 * T + 14 * P)
* if T&gt;=300, get a new exponential random variable T, draw the balance line from (t, B(t)) to (t+300+T, B(t) - 0.1 * (300+T)) and a jump (X * 1E-8 +14)* P at time t+300+T
All a receiver party needs to do is to wait a length of time before the delivery by consulting the compensation pricing table and the timestamp of the TX1 in the block template of miners.  Although the economics of crypto is not yet widely understood and implemented, for a typical USD 100 transaction and bitcoin at the price USD 10000, the said length of time is 0.428 second and traditional miners never bother to replace a typical TX1 with TX2.  Our 2 bitcoin or 140 bitcoin TX1 is for the purpose to explain the economics here in the thread only; both are obvious not typical transactions unless cheap bitcoin price of the old days; it was a great risk to deliver that 10000-bitcoin pizza only with 3600 seconds aka 6 blocks.

\&gt; I'm exclusively taking about DEF2, since we are exclusively talking about 0-conf transactions, which is where this all stemmed from.
Note that the now of DEF1 and DEF2 is at 0 minute, not at 3 minute.  At time 0, no one knows T is greater than 3 or not.  It seems you think DEF1 is "If T&lt;3" and DEF2 is "If T&gt;=3".  It is not.  DEF1 and DEF2 have both "upper path" and "lower path".
Here in this comment thread, I am always thinking the problem: "I, as a double spender, TX1 at minute 0 in block template and mining starts, how much do I need to pay/convince TX2 into mining at minute 3" therefore it is DEF1 "If T&lt;3 then 3+T1 else 3+T2".  You can of course have DEF2 as the cost calculation.  But then it is weird to the average Joe in the sense that:
1. To change the blocktime algorithm with the same 10 average has a different answer although everything outside the black box is the same.
2. All he cares is to replace TX1 with TX2, not concern about the block is found or not. "yes! yes! I know there is a block at 6 second but now at 3 minute and I just don't want TX1" is not described by DEF2.
Anyway, I think people/merchants are more interested in trust level of "instant TX" rather than trust level of "TX not yet in a block" because they don't even know a block is found or a 6-second block could be orphan or else.  Also, if you come out another compensation table for case of block already found and set the compensation table for case of block not found to be zero, after average the two tables, it must be the same as DEF1's result: 14/10\*3 coin.  After all, people/merchants may simply demand miners to publish a compensation table of "delay-time ==&gt; coins", refuse any jargon and don't care miners find a block or not.
\&gt; would argue that the 3 minutes of compensation1 doesn't get paid for until a block is found
It is already mentioned in bottomline2 that the revenue shall has nothing to do with the cost and its compensation calculation.  When you calculate cost compensation, you don't need to know where revenue is.
\&gt; Keep in mind that a single miner isn't getting every block, so there is a massive amount of variance to what they're doing.
For simplicity here in the thread it is assumed all miners have the same boss.  If you adjust the work/cost with the block finding probability, the same expectation math formula will appear.  Further, with risk-averse preference, the variance is helpful to more conservative (higher) pricing of compensation.
\&gt; 3 minutes of compensation1 doesn't change their stance that having 7 (or even 10) minutes of TX2's compensation1 is more desirable than TX1.
I don't quite understand what this sentence means.  When the now is at 3 minute, the coming block is expected to be found at time 13 minute.  All the cost from minute 3 to minute 13 is covered by TX2 and all other TX.
\&gt; Additionally, it seems that you think that changing a transaction out for another one resets the 10 minute average. It doesn't.
Not sure what context you mean.  Any way there are five contexts I can think of in the comment thread.
1. In repeat simulation, X be any constant. If the "changing a transaction" is conditional on "if T&gt;X then remine at minute X else accept the block", then the average block time is still 10 minutes.
2. In repeat simulation, X be any constant. If the "changing a transaction" is always at minute X and remine the block, then the average block time is 10+X.
3. E\[T | T&gt;X\] = 10+X
4. Repeat mining at minute 1, 2, .... until T&lt;1, then average block time is 10 (search "the stuff")
5. Conditional at any minute of the 4, the expectation time length of the new mining is 10
It seems you have trouble in 4 and 5 being both valid.  Here "changing a transaction" must be well-defined constant event otherwise one would think 4 and 5 contradict; you cannot always "change TX1 at minute 3" in 4 and think “see! 10! It doesn’t” because not all simulation of 4 can reach minute 3.
\&gt; The "work of last three minutes cannot be right because it contains TX1" is incorrect, as TX1 is still valid, but so is TX2.
In the movie, TX1 is assumed seated 0\~3 minute.  The "valid" of signature/inputs is irrelevant here in this discussion.  TX1 and TX2 cannot be both in a block.  The now is at minute 3.  The miner can ignore TX2 and all the 0\~3 minute work is right. Or, the miner can ignore TX1 and all the 0\~3 minute work is wrong.  Here the miner accepts TX2 and that statement "work of last three minutes cannot be right because it contains TX1" is born.
\&gt; we get out of DEF2 and into DEF1
See above by search "It seems"; there is no such concept of "get out of DEF2 and into DEF1".

Just a method to convince you.


When the block space is utilized, the average block fee is irrelevant to block size limit and always the same.  This issue may be a little bit off the topic of the thread but I can credit you where I learned about it long ago  .  In short, if I accept that author's assumption of 0.5% per year for time preference/real term risk-free lending rate, the block fee is estimated to be 1.9977  ( = 21M * 0.5% * 600/( 86400 * 365 ) ).   Here I take 1.5 is basically being lazy for an integer of block revenue.  You being a miner can estimate that number based on historical data too.


In this simulation I set each TX the same fee ( =1.5/10 ).  You can pretty much enhance that code to simulate different fee.  But as mentioned, the block seats are all occupied and "one in" must be with "one out".  I don't do that simulation yet, but I think the conclusion is the same with average number for all.  Many parts of crypto using average number, you don't lower the selling price of the coinbase coin even that coin is from a 6 seconds block with 1% of average mining (energy) work due to good luck.


First of all, here the 3 minutes are not necessarily the time the miners already commit the mining work.  Currently in the thread, we only consider the cost due to mining and no auxiliary cost such as "parking in the mempool".  As mentioned in the bottomline 1, miners may have different cost opinion, one may think staying in his mempool is a cost, one may think the block reward is for his reserve not in the cost base (for a miner who plans to mine till next halving the cost base of a block is 12.5 + block fee, but for a miner who plans to mine forever the cost base of a block is only block fee).
Therefore, let's consider two cases (1) the miners' business are mining till next halving and no other auxiliary cost (2) the miners' business are mining forever and no other auxiliary cost.  Also, let's assume what you mean by that 3 minutes is the time related to the mining work, no internet speed variation issue.
case (1).  The fee schedule is 0.023333333 per second ( = (12.5+1.5)/600 ).  After 3 minutes, the additional fee shall be 4.2.  But you will never do that rationally, I feel safe to deliver my service to you because no miners accept your TX2. 
case (2).  The fee schedule is 0.0025 per second ( = 1.5/600 ).  After 3 minutes, the additional fee shall be 0.45.  Still, no miners will accept your TX2 at time 3 minute.  But you are possibly to do another TX2 rationally (you have a total budget 1.0 bitcoin for that task), I feel not safe to deliver my service to you at time 3 minute neither.  And, I will wait additional 220 seconds to assure the miners commit 400 ( = 1.0/0.0025 ) seconds mining work on your TX1.  If nothing strange happens, I will safely deliver my service to you at time 400 second.  If you indeed launch another TX2 during these 220 seconds, I will laugh at you and never deliver my service and even report you to credit agents about your behavior if our business has some KYC.

eh?  no, nothing new, no need to change any protocol/consensus about mining.  At most, it suffices to add some API code in the mining node for users to get the info about timestamp of TX1 in the block template for mining and a miner's web page explaining his compensation pricing table.




To be fair, some miners are not crystal clear about the cost.  As miners gain easy profit, they won't calculate cost seriously.  Even to be conservative and therefore assume all miners plan their business forever, the additional fee 0.01 can only buy 4 ( =0.01/1.5 * 600 ) seconds which means if TX2 is received later TX1 more than 4 seconds, miners will reject TX2.  For many miners, they simply play the rule of thumb of accepting the first TX only no matter what; otherwise that infamous 6000 bitcoin hack should have been handled smoothly/economically instead.  Another explanation for your observation is that, your TX1 is parking in the mempool and miners don't commit the mining work for it yet; when miners construct the block template, they collect TXs from the mempool based on fee and don't care it is newly put into the mempool or not.


No, it is not 7, it is still 10.  For mining time of exponential distribution and you already mine X minutes and find no block, the expectation of the mining time since this time spot is still 10 minutes, no matter how big X is and you replace TX1 with TX2 or not.
Btw, forgot to mention. The time to find a block of your "special" miner is of again exponential distribution: say, you add 3 new TX sequentially and finally get a block at time 3.2 minute, the probability density at time 3.2 is Pr(T1&gt;1) * Pr(T2&gt;1) * Pr(T3&gt;1) * Pr(T4 = 0.2) which is exp( -1/10) * exp( -1/10) * exp( -1/10) * 0.1* exp (-0.2 / 10) = 0.1 * exp(-3.2 / 10)


You can replace 300 with a number greater than 4 in that excel simulation and see what you get, the 0.01+1.5 jump, is not worthwhile by witnessing your money balance goes south as the trial repeats.

Ok then.  But at least allow me to have a closing argument just like in court.
I think the word "compensation" may require more precise scope to avoid misunderstanding.  Given the past and the now and the future, let's define compensation1 as the compensation for the damage/loss since the past till the now and compensation2 as the compensation for the damage/loss from the now to the future.  Compensation1 focuses on the real history and compensation2 focuses on the expectation of the future and these two are not necessarily the same.  For example, a plant has been in operation for 10 years and unknowingly has been polluting a farm.  The plant is here to stay however and both sides go to court and there comes to a compensation package of compensation1 and compensation2, it is possible compensation1 to be huge and the compensation2 to be tiny, or otherwise.
Back to bitcoin.
Here we need to define "double spend" more precisely.  To my definition, named "DEF1", it simply means TX2 to replace TX1, nothing to do with a block is found during this 3 minutes or not; "TX1 at time 0 and a block including TX1 is found at time 3 second and TX2 is launched at time 10 second" is also a double spend to me.  We can have other definition of double spend and it is "DEF2" which means TX2 to replace TX1 when no block is found during these 3 minutes.
So, we have four cases to conclude the compensation, two "we are talking about compensation1" and "we are talking about compensation2" by two "we are talking about DEF1" and "we are talking about DEF2".  For the two cases of compensation2, the now is at time 0 minute.  For the two cases of compensation1, the now is at time 3 minute.
Let's have cases of compensation2 first.
Let T be the random variable of a distribution for the time length to find a block.  Let T1, T2, ... are the iid of T.  To talk about DEF1, the time length to have the wanted block is "if T1&lt;3 then 3 + T2 else 3 + T3".  To talk about DEF2, it is "if T1&lt;3 then T1 else 3 + T2".  The expectations of the time length are 3+10 in DEF1 and Pr(T1&lt;3)E(T1 | T1&lt;3)+Pr(T1&gt;=3)(3+10) in DEF2.  Different distributions of T have different answer for the expectation in DEF2.  If T's distribution is exponential, then the answer is surprisingly still 10; in fact, it is always 10 even we replace that 3 with 300; in your thinking, if a block is not found in 300 minutes, there is no need for the compensation still.  I think this is the reason why you insist there is no need for "additional compensation" and why you recognize the fact that "miners keep changing the TXs during the mining" as an evidence of my being wrong.  Should T be other distribution, say, a sharp 100% probability at 10, the Pr(T1&lt;3)E(T1 | T1&lt;3)+Pr(T1&gt;=3)(3+10) is 13 then you will recognize a compensation2 of 3 minutes' work instead, or compensation2 of any 0-to-3 minutes for some lower sigma/mean distribution.  Another reason I think your double spend definition is DEF2 is that "a block is found between TX1 and TX2 or not" means a lot to you.  The above is the case of compensation2 and DEF2.
The case of compensation2 and DEF1.  The expectation of "if T1&lt;3 then 3 + T2 else 3 + T3" is always 13, therefore 3 minutes' compensation2 is required.
For cases of compensation1, the average work time is always 13 and therefore require 3 minutes' work compensation to compensate the miners.  Let's imagine a "movie" of your miner where compensation1 is adopted.  Being a movie, the now is moving.  At time 0, TX1 and many other TX are included in the block template and mining launches.  At time 1 minute, no block found yet, some TX are out because less fee and some TX are in because higher fee, mining launches.  At time 2 minute, again the same as last minute, so far, the miner has done two minutes work which is not violating the goal.  At time 3 minute, TX2 is received with a tiny-higher-than-TX1-fee fee, the miner says "shit! the work of last three minutes cannot be right because it contains TX1" and TX1 is out and TX2 is in, mining launches.  The now is at minute 3 and the expectation is 10 minutes away in the future (not 7 because the now is at 3 minute), the miner is thinking who shall pay the compensation1 of the 3 minutes "me? TX2? all the other TX? god?".

Let's choose a neutral name instead of "attacker"; as mentioned, that attacker might be a victim trying to get his money back.
The double spender needs to pay an acceptable fee to the miner so it is not "nothing to lose".  Say, the TX1 is in the block template at time 0, and the double-spent TX2 is received by the miner at time 600, also, no block is found yet.  TX2 cannot be with TX1 so the mining work is waived at all the committed cost, why does the miner accept the double spender's TX2 for no compensation?  that 600 seconds kwh is costly.
If you read my invitation thread, you will see you can play a simulation about the situation on a spread sheet.  If the double spender pays no additional fee for TX2, you being the miner will go broke.  I think this is the best way for one to educate himself.
A side note.  This question appears again and again in the community, I have been instructing guys like you about it for years.  And they all finally learn where their minds go wrong.  Be modest and intellectual.

Historically and luckily, the statement "more hash rate results in more security" is true, logically it is not.  Knowing that AntMiner S7 is 0.25 Joule per giga hash and Dragonmint T1 is 0.096 Joule per giga hash, let's say someone replaces a 1000000 giga hash mining farm of old S7 with 1500000 giga hash mining farm of new T1, the whole network security is in fact reduced.

The reason that the assurance is with some probability is because the fact that a user simply cannot ask all miners in the world about his TX.  The genuine assurance is by the economic force of the cost to double spend (aka to rollback, to attack), not by the probability.  For two 6 blocks depth TXs, both are the same "99.9% probability of assurance" in your wording, but one TX is with total input 0.01 bitcoin and the other TX is with total input 10000 bitcoin, they mean quite a lot different in the daily life sense of "assurance".


Ok. I was simply to mean we don't need to bother the route of the thinking BFY, ....etc to save time.


No, I didn't have that intention.  The "remine" is simply to map the mind set of realizing a new random variable of block-found-time for formalizing the math equations or coding the simulation.  It could be a big deal for other random variable distributions and it could rarely change if the block capacity is full and each TX has the same fee, but they are not my concern here in the comment thread.


Typically in exponential distribution, the change of the block template such as replace a lower fee TX with a higher fee TX is not wasted.  But the mining work of block template having TX1 is wasted because we don't want TX1 and we want TX2.  Compensation1 is about real history by definition.


This was already explained before in the comment thread.  Search "reach minute 3".


I would say the math I provide here is simple.  Instead, I think many properties of the exponential distribution complicates this topic and you unknowingly take it for granted; "it's incredibly simple" is false otherwise all your conclusion would remain if we change the exponential distribution to some other low sigma/mean ratio distribution proposed by developers.


Search "reach minute 3".  To get that 7 minutes average, you don't always have "you spend 3 minutes mining TX1, switching to TX2".


It will not be actively vulnerable if miners set C2(t) some non-zero value.


As mentioned, economics of crypto is not widely understood.  After all, we have t = Pr[T&lt;t] * C1(t) + Pr[T&gt;=t] * C2(t) and it is mathematically ok with C1(t) = t / Pr[T&lt;t] and C2(t) = 0 though I doubt this arrangement could be practically/psychologically feasible and I think the best feasible arrangement is C1(t) = C2(t) = t which matches compensation1 psychologically.

First of all, I cannot say this is my theory. I credit my learning from a [site]( and I could never contact that author even I wanted to.
\&gt; Interesting you found yourself a method to predict future prices. What will be the price of BTC June next year according to your endorsed theory?
No, I cannot have a solid prediction.  BTC is not the hypothetical sound money because its energy cost per unit would change based on the total mining power input; you need to speculate on the mining power in an ultimate future to get the number.  However, current energy mining power information, K, is available so one can estimate K / (B + F) as the current lower bound (assuming miners would end the business after the halving) and K / F as the current upper bound (assuming all the mining businessmen would mine forever) and one expects a current crazy volatility between these two numbers and remembers adjusting K as time goes by.
That said, with some material in that mentioned site and my own research in energy industry, I estimate the energy power to maintain the trust (treat it as a typical commodity) is 1.34% of the total available energy power.  It is difficult to speculate the energy consumption in a future.  Assuming the same global energy level as present situation and bitcoin is the only money (note that these two assumptions may turn out false), then P could stabilize at K / F which is 720k USD (today USD) assuming the global average 0.1 USD per kwh.  Speculate on cutting energy consumption (and therefore all the consumption) to 0.01x for the sake of civilization survival or on bitcoin being only 0.01x of all money industry, then K / F could be 7.2k USD.  Speculate on bitcoin being 7.2M USD (assuming the fusion power generator is a thing and people command the 10x abundant energy to recycle resource/production/consumption)
\&gt; And to ensure that your theory statistically holds water, what will be the price of oil, gold, sugar, and iron ore June next year?
The goods' marginal cost is not necessarily constant, many of them have significant slope in supply curve. It is the job of a commodity futures analyst to give the number.  It is typical that farmers expect some hurricane so a futures price becomes higher in summer, for example.
\&gt; Can you source this?
See the site I mentioned.  Basically:
Let m and s be the mean and standard deviation of the daily collected amount of a commodity, then it is expected N = 1/m days to have one unit, calculate the distribution of m1+m2+...+mN and see how it changes when m and s become 0.01x, 0.0001x,..... and ultimately constant unit cost of production.
Anyway, it is natural for people to use their energy budget as money in a spaceship with permanent energy flow and constant amount materials and Earth is a spaceship.

This is what I meant you tend to "rhetorical".  A double-spender is simply asking you a question then you deny the question and claim "that's not possible", then how can the double-spender and you conduct a business honestly in that case?  You being a mining node operator could simply say "In that case, you need to pay me X more coins in addition" but you however deny the business question and bury your head in the sand.


I am using the term "committed" to reference the spent energy reported in my kwh meter, not necessarily spent to a "valid" anything.  This is why I have the wording "the committed mining cost for TX1 is wasted" if the TX1-block turns out to be invalid (because a TX2-block chain turns out to be longer) or TX1 turns out to be replaced by TX2 in the block template.


This is false.  The software algorithm is to equate the empirical average block time to the expected block time 10 minutes.  It doesn't claim the 10 minutes is "most likely".  In fact, the highest probability density of exponential distribution is at 0 and the probability density is decreasing with respect to block time.


This is false and I believe you didn't conduct the research of your claim in any bit.  The "all blocks &gt;15 minutes since the last one" is irrelevant.  As mentioned above, the probability density of block time T minutes is 0.1 * exp(-0.1 * T), 5-minutes block is always more likely than 10-minutes block which is always more likely than 15-minutes block, nothing to do with that "&gt;15" or otherwise "&gt;1".

You are correct in this interpretation.  For this Bob's TX1, if the miners commit the mining cost beyond 86 seconds  ( = 600 \* 2 / (12.5+1.5) ) then Bob has no incentive to double spend a TX2, it means the receiver, Alice,  of TX1 can safely deliver her service even TX1 is 0-conf.

Don't quite understand what you mean.  What I said is as below and there shall be no fuzz in my reasoning.
If adopt DEF2 and compensation2, your compensation calculation is:
10 = Pr[T&lt;t] * E[T |T&lt;t] + Pr[T&gt;=t] * E[ t + T1 - C(t) |T&gt;=t] and your advertisement is "I will remine for you at t minutes later if you pay additional C(t) * 14/10 fee and the block is not found at t minutes later".  Note that this is not a promise to remine and the now is at minute 0; it is contingent on the event that coming block will not be found in t minutes.  BUT, I don't think this is your advertisement.  With exponential distribution, C(t) is zero, though.  
If adopt DEF1 and compensation2, your compensation calculation is:
10 = Pr[T&lt;t] * E[ t + T1 - C(t) |T&lt;t] + Pr[T&gt;=t] * E[ t + T2 - C(t) |T&gt;=t] and your advertisement is "I will remine for you at t minutes later if you pay additional C(t) * 14/10 fee".  Note that this is a promise to remine and the now is at minute 0.  With any distribution, C(t) = t.
If adopt DEF1 and compensation2 and with different fee for cases of a block (of TX1) is found or not, your compensation calculation is:
10 = Pr[T&lt;t] * E[ t + T1 - C1(t) |T&lt;t] + Pr[T&gt;=t] * E[ t + T2 - C2(t) |T&gt;=t] and your advertisement is "I will remine for you at t minutes later if you pay additional C1(t) * 14/10 fee in case of the block of TX1 is found or you pay additional C2(t) * 14/10 fee in case of the block of TX1 is not found".  Note that this is a promise to remine and the now is at minute 0.  With any distribution, Pr[T&lt;t] * C1(t) + Pr[T&gt;=t] * C2(t) = t.  You can of course set C2(t) = 0 and set C1(t) = t / Pr[T&lt;t] accordingly; I thought this is your advertisement though I suspect there will be many disputes between Joe and you where Joe insists no block is found and you insist otherwise.  
If adopt compensation1, your compensation calculation C(t) is to count the work done on TX1 already because the now is at minute t.  Say, TX1 as being committed the work since minute 0, C(t) = t.
The above is the standard business analysis.  In my opinion about average Joe, compensation1 shall agree with compensation2 in a long run, therefore I think he expects "adopt DEF1 and compensation2" though you disagree somehow. 


I assume you mean the word "confirm" by "include in a block".  Why not?  6-seconds block or 3-minutes block is not rare.


Can you being a miner imagine a block whose block template contains TX1 is not found for 300 minutes already and TX2 is only tiny higher fee than TX1?  Your DEF2 mind will be overruled by the compensation1 mind.  No? replace 300 with 3000.  It is always zero if you are religiously stuck in DEF2 mind.


As mentioned, there is no revenue in the consideration, let alone profit.  In practice, that revenue is even 100 blocks far away and a new block can be roll backed without impact on the block reward of the total 100 blocks if the TX2 price is right.  If the price is not right and some miners accept it, I expect those miners go broke eventually in the promise of replacing TX1.
@_date: 2019-08-08 19:09:10
I wish there is a software where an additional fee pricing table can be established about TX in the block template to profit the possible double-spending transaction.  Say, TX1 appears in block template at timestamp A and a double-spending TX2 appears later at timestamp B with additional fee C.  Then I can replace TX1 with TX2 in the block template based on B - A and C where B - A represents the forgone mining cost and C represents the cost compensation.
For example, when Bob gets scammed his 2 bitcoin and he knows it after 1 minutes, he could still get back 0.6 bitcoin, 2 - (12.5+1.5) / 10, by setting an additional fee 1.4 bitcoin.  This mechanism also helps 0-conf confidence too.

We are not talking about cost parking in mempool; we are talking about mining cost and 10 minutes' cost is represented by 14 ( = 12.5 + 1.5) coins.  You are just anything but a modest learner.
Say, you commit the mining cost for TX1 and a double spender sends TX2 after 3 minutes and you remine the block. Also, let's say you imperatively collect the "lost block revenue" if a block is found before 3 minutes, i.e. you set C1(3) to be 10.  We have Pr[T&lt;3] = 1- exp(-3/10) = 0.2592 and Pr[T&gt;=3] = 0.7408 so mathematically C2(3) shall be (3 - Pr[T&lt;3] * 10) / Pr[T&gt;=3] = 0.5510, aka 0.7714 coins ( = 0.5510 * 1.4 ).  However, you are so stubborn/ignorant that you allow TX2 to replace TX1 at only additional 0.000014 coins, aka C2(3) = 0.00001. You can simulate the double spender against your mining business; sometimes he gets caught in C1(3) and sometimes he gets caught in C2(3) and you will have higher TX2 block revenue (be it 12.5 + 1.5 + C1(3) or 12.5 + 1.5 + C2(3) ) and the law of large numbers will bankrupt you.

This explanation is wrong.  The correct reason is simply that many TX are waiting due to block size limit and do not participate in the block header hash calculation.
Suppose the TXs are coming uniformly as OP and block size capacity limit is not reached, then the block time length also represents the number of TXs.  Therefore the average block time being 10 minutes also represents the average confirmation time of a TX being 10 minutes.

Public choice is a function of people's preference to an aggregate preference. By Arrow's impossibility theorem which is a formal mathematical proof, the function of public choice with all the 6 conditions is a pipe dream. In other words, holding 5 out of the 6, the last one will be sacrificed:
1. Preference of each individual is free in all possibility
2. As long as the ordering of individual preference remains, the public choice function has the same answer.
3. Transitivity
4. Binary independence
5. Unanimity
6. No dictator
So, which one you like to drop so that the public choice mechanism is possible? Some examples, Nazi drops 1, US/West European's political pendulum drops 3 or 4, China drops 6.
My personal taste is to drop 2 aka ordinal utility. For example, three people and four items (or policies or president candidates): A&gt;B&gt;C&gt;D, A&gt;B&gt;D&gt;C, B&gt;A&gt;C&gt;D. The outcome is dependent on how "much" the people's preference on A, B, C, D, not on the ordering only. In fact, free market supporters might drop 2 too, say, to decide the aggregate preference by the method of "pay the candidates money or vote by money" so that A or B is the aggregate best.
Suppose you prefer drop of 2 as well.  The problem is then how to avoid wealth inequality.  Traditional fiat money system causes a few people's advantage of access newly print money and therefore wealthier as time goes by.  So, the answer to Arrow's impossibility is sound money.

Say, an TX1 is already in a block.  After 3 minutes the double spender's TX2 arrives, how much do you charge him for the replacement?


As you can see the pseudocode (I sent you before) about block seats and mempool, I intentionally distinguish the TX being hashed on (which there is serious cost going on, aka the mining electricity) from other TX parking in the mempool (which there is little-or-non cost going on and not our main concern in the comment thread).  So, you are saying that you will charge the double spender the same (the tiny near-zero) for the both?  Any way, you are saying that you will charge the double spender tiny-zero if a block is not found and you have spent the mining electricity for TX1 for 3 minutes.  Then, it is ok with respect to business contract (but not ok economically as explained).


Exactly.  That is why many people claim "it ruins 0-conf" but I would rather say the ruin is due to the lack of (double spending) market and the understanding of crypto economics.


You are totally wrong about the block time (I am curious who/where told you that wrong info) math.  For a single mining rig, the block time is uniformly distributed.  However, there is huge number, N, of rigs and the block time is the 1st-order statistic (the min among all N iid block time) and the end result is then the exponential distribution via the math (1 + 1/N)^N approaches e ( =2.71828301 ) as N approaches infinity.  What I said about the "18 = 8 + 10" is the property of the exponential distribution, nothing mysterious unless you are not familiar with math.  The difficulty does not change because the expectation is still 10 while the conditional expectation is 18.  The difficulty will change only if rig efficiency or number of rigs changes which is irrelevant to the comment thread.

In competitive markets, the price is the marginal cost of production.  When the supply curve is (nearly) horizontal which can be implied by scarcity thanks to the central limit theorem in probability math, the market price becomes indeed the cost of production.
The caveat is that, when we talk about price of an apple, we describe it as a number in term of money, but now we are talking about the price of a money, we shall not describe it in term of money itself tautologically.   Then, you come to accept (or do not accept) the axiom of purchasing power that one shall pay the same amount of money to boil water decades before and after.  If you accept the axiom, then you describe the price/cost of a money in term of energy.  A difficult truth AE can handle due to their hate about Marxist.

There is still 21M bitcoin if people follow this practice. I think you misunderstand what I said and you still define the currency ticker by the chain.

Nations have different endowment about surplus, one may spend 1 Joule to get 10 Joule with 9 Joule surplus, the other may spend 1 Joule to only get 3 Joule with 2 Joule surplus.  The surplus is the welfare of the citizens, the higher it is, the higher reward for the same task of a citizen.  For example, nation A has more surplus than nation B, be the surplus due to robbery of other nations (blunt violent war or civil money trick (nation A prints money from thin air and purchase the fuel from nation B with that money) ) or honest abundant domestic fossil fuel, citizens of nation B will always wish to move to nation A.
You see sound money can be helpful to ease the situation because the only way to get richer in sound money economy is to harvest more new energy/resource or to improve the efficiency such as another Earth or economic efficiency or technical efficiency; no more easy robbery as mentioned above.

Sort of this but three clarifications are required:
1. "attempted to mine" is committing the mining cost or not?
2. "drop from the mempool" is not the issue with respect to mining cost; a TX can be in mempool for a long time but the miner does not commit the mining work about the said TX.
3. "mine on your TX1" means to contribute the mining work about TX1, include finding a block on top of a TX1-block or not?  When a miner is trying to find a block on top a TX1-block, he is reinforcing the trust/security of that TX1 and indeed contributes the mining work about TX1.
Think yourself as a double spender.  What clearer statement about the double-spending business offered by miners do you expect?


We are back to square zero and you just don't realize what "conditional probability/expectation" means in math, do you?  I thought you realized where you went wrong with that "3 + 7" and now you come again with "8 + 2"!  If the block is not found yet at minutes 15, ironically, would you think the expected average block time since the minute 15 after the switch is -5?
2 minutes is never the answer.  You can collect all the historical data for blocks whose block time is beyond 8 minutes and calculate the answer, the answer will be 10, not 2.

Trust without cost is an empty promise.  With miner's fee, mining cost per unit coin is the necessity to quantitatively measure the cost of trust (aka the cost of rollback, attack) represented by the coin.  Mining operation needs to be costly to make sense and miners get the compensation in term of block fee (assuming all the halvings are over) accordingly.
Block fee also relates to the efficiency of a hypothetical battery and the time preference of the money savers.  Say, let q be the inefficiency loss rate per unit of time in the battery discharge/charge process, it means that discharging a battery of 100 kwh to empty and recharging to full 100 kwh causes some energy loss which demands an offset from the operators.  You can play the math around dP/dt = K - q \* P to have a taste where K is the energy power, be it positive or negative.  Within a same period of operation time length t, calculate A the energy power for consumption and B the energy power for charging, then B/A = exp(q \* t), just like a risk-free interest rate.
With axiom of purchasing power that one shall pay the same amount of money to boil water decades before and after, money is indeed like an ideal battery and the purchasing power of a money is indeed like the energy amount contained in the battery.  It is also not lunatic that a lender demands some interest rate even it is a risk-free lending when the borrower claims he does repay in full every time.

If one can commit energy more than this "proof-of-work" number per coin, he can rollback the blockchain ledger for his interest.  As long as this number demonstrates the cost of trust and cost of security and the price of the coin, I don't think I have rephrased anything.  Also note that work and energy are both physics terms with the same measurement units.

OP simply doesn't understand proof-of-work and trust is in fact the cost of attack/alter a commitment.  Let X be the effective equivalent work of all the tasks to protect the trust worth of 100, being so-called "energy-efficient", X is less than 100.  The attacker therefore could attack/bribe/alter the trust and gain 100 - X

Alice won't lose the on-chain 2-of-2 coins by being in coma for more than two weeks.  The states of the LN channel will change from time to time and either party could submit a pre-state to claim the settlement if Alice doesn't care or doesn't hire someone to care.  This differs a lot in the two coins.


I wish you care for your economic interest.  But feel free not to if you don't.  As mentioned, it is ok if there are many separate small lightning networks around the globe so people don't need to be too serious.  But if there would be only a small number of huge LN, it is you that would face the inconvenient consequences.  Besides those as mentioned in comments which results from the non-stoppable economic force.  There are many other possible inconvenient treatments.  Possibly a license fee to LN operator so that their cost of per LN coin is raised higher to match that of the on-chain coins.  Possibly the LN operator would require a final adjustment while closing channel...
Keep in mind in a free market of no-arbitrage condition the exchange rate is K * V' / K' / V LN coins per on-chain coin where K is the on-chain mining power and V is the on-chain coin volume and K' is a LN (watch tower) work and V' is LN coin volume and this number is 1 by LN design.  Knowing that K' is small compared with K and quote from AA "people will have the vast majority of their funds on Lightning all the time. The only funds that are not on Lightning are the funds you keep in cold storage" implying V' close to V, you can see the contradiction from the point of view of economics.

Glad to know that.  I was just to point out that treating money as energy is not "wrong chain of thought".  In fact, by the law of energy conservation and the axiom requirement that a same amount of sound money shall be able to pay for "boiling 100 gram water" in a remote past and future, sound money is indeed isomorphic to energy.
For your interest of "translation", you may: "gold" to "bitcoin", "searching and mining and recycling of gold" to "proof-of-work of bitcoin", "all gold are mined" to "all 21M coins are mined", "recycled gold from electronic waste" to "block transaction fee of bitcoin", "new mined gold" to "block reward of bitcoin".  It is the gold's proof-of-work characteristic that makes it special; I believe the painting of my kids are rare in the world but people will not treat it as a storage of wealth or media of exchange much because they think it is highly possible a graffiti.

No.  The definition of "Alice informs Betty remotely" is "Betty can conduct a physical measure which is statistically related to a physical action Alice does" therefore there is no information method faster than light speed.  The common wording of quantum entanglement's "infinitely fast information speed" is a miss leading because Alice or Betty can only have measure in her end and has no way to know the measure on the other end (otherwise no need to "inform") hence no way to enjoy the infinitely-fast correlation of the measurement of both ends.

It is not "it is done".  Should no more gold recycling/mining assure the mining cost as the cost of trust and the proof-of-work, no one dares to measure the exchange value in gold amount.  What if there is a tech improvement that the mining cost of gold x0.5, and nobody knows this except Joe.
Or you are asking the huge energy consumption in a future?  Then, the fair price of a money in terms of energy is K/qV where K is the permanent mining energy power and q is the time preference rate per second and V is volume.  Assuming the global M1+gold 4.45E+13 USD and q 0.5% annually and 0.1 USD per kwh (3.6M Joules), the energy power to satisfy the trust demand is 2.54E+11 Joule per second.  Compared with all energy consumption, it is 1.4% of global energy power.  People consume the energy for entertainment, manufacture, farming, transportation, ...maintain trust token, and the usage percentage of each class remains stable.  People will not maintain too many trust tokens and too little entertainment, for example.  All kinds of money compete the 1.4% and bitcoin cannot consume more than this percentage even it is the only money in the world.

I think few people question the 3 properties in crypto so OP argument about bitcoin volatility seems not justified.  On the other hand, the production cost plays a big part because marginal cost of the producers is the market price in a competitive market.  However, with halving design, the cost estimation is drastically different among producers; the cost could be very low if a producer plans to mine in a short business horizon, or it could be very high if a producer plans to mine eternally.

If someone could move that coin to your address, X, say, "from (	1B61xAMy1T3PgqHm8D55UN162rrkNn6o3L, 300000000) to (	1B61xAMy1T3PgqHm8D55UN162rrkNn6o3L, 199999000) and (X, 100000000)" and this record is recorded in all the three chains, how much USD shall you pay by the current market?  It is the sum of market price of BTC coin and BAB coin and BSV coin.
The coins recorded in all chains, aka bitcoin, enjoy 100% proof-of-work of all miners not BTC chain miners only.

Alice's wallet software is a simple shell script who wraps around three "official" software each of which is for one specific chain of the total three chains.  The shell script internally composes the three relevant messages and broadcasts to the three relevant chains behind the scene.
Alice operates her wallet to transact with Bob.  Assume A be Alice's address and the coin, represented as a tuple (A, satoshi) nothing to do with its history, is already in the UTXO of the three chains.  Let B be Bob's address and P be the payment of transaction and F be the fee.  The message "(A, satoshi) pays to (B, P) and (A, satoshi - P - F)" is then recorded in all the three chains.
Now the price of the coin in question is the sum of all the three coins.  The coin also requires highest cost to be attacked.  Alice never uses the wrong key/address because she uses different secret seeds for different ticker.  The coin is also immune in the swing of mining powers among the chains.
What is the problem with the above?  Why do you just cannot recognize Alice's coin is the bitcoin and the truth that coin's ticker is defined by the ledger records, not by the chain?  bitcoin is the mentioned tuples in all significant chains; it cares nothing about the death of any specific chain.  B1 is the ticker for the coins only recorded in chain 1 and B2 is the ticker for the coins only recorded in chain 2 and B3 is the ticker for the coins only recorded in chain 3.  B23 is the ticker for the coins only recorded in chain 2 and chain 3 if you like.  If chain 1 is dead, "the coins recorded in all significant chains" is naturally the same as B23, economically and technically.
In a parallel universe, the development of the three chains is for specific feature, no dog fight and no confusing ticker who hurts merchant/investment stability.

The smart contract has nothing to do with this issue.  Suppose you have a coin which miners need to commit 100 work per coin.

The both are not contradictory.  One unit of money could depreciate a lot while the wealth increases.  Say, 1.00 USD can boil 10 gallon water 100 years ago and the same amount 1.00 USD can only boil 0.1 gallon water currently.  The case that a person is with USD 100 100 years ago and a person currently with USD 100000 is for you where the wealth becomes x10 and the money depreciates x0.01.
You can measure how living standard improves by energy consumption per capita and it is indeed improving on average (the mathematical average, not 50%-percentile or else) over time.  But you should also understand that 1.00 USD can boil 100 gallon water if money volume remains intact.  With regard to wealth distribution, this is much better for the society because all persons (even the 1%-percentile person) enjoy the fruits at the same ratio; one does not have to be the lucky/dirty one (the ones who can get the new money in first hand) who has USD 100000 to enjoy the x10 wealth.

You can estimate the Joules per coin in the proof-of-work to know the real term price and the answer.  By axiom of purchasing power that one shall pay the same amount of money to boil water in 100 years ago and after, you can treat sound money as a conceptual battery and the contained energy as its real term price and purchasing power; the coin appreciates when the Joules amount gets higher, the coin depreciates when the Joules amount gets lower.

Sadly people do blame the collapse on the last grain of sand rather than the big picture.
I used to know about catastrophe theory, a branch of math analysis of states points of a system.  Though the "tipping points" or bifurcation points are measure zero among the states points and are critical to define the realm of the states points, it is somewhat unfair to claim much of common science are linear domains.  For example, a civil engineering will take into account the wind to the structure's stability parameters to avoid something like Tacoma Narrows Bridge 1940, and admittedly, most of the time the structure responds locally linearly to the wind, safely away from those bifurcation points to keep its desired state.
Any way, I do agree volatility is necessary for a neural network or a collective wisdom (a market for example) to convey information then to find the answer when people are not clever enough.

To my concern about being money, a coin is a tuple of address and satoshi.  Let's say, a ledger stating (addr1, sat1) is consumed to (addr2, sat2) and (addr3, sat3).  If this ledger is recorded in all the chains, it enjoys higher proof-of-work than ledgers only recorded in one specific chain and therefore the coins (addr1, sat1), (addr2, sat2), (addr3, sat3) are more valuable.
My question is, why do people not give coins that are recorded in all significant and alive chains and are most secured, highest price a currency ticker, say ₿, independent of the chains?

There are two prices for any financial asset and any theory/model.  One is the market price and the other is the model price.  While market price is sometimes volatile and crazy, the model price is consistently stable according to the latest information and a theory.  Believing some theory and being a trader, Alice will long (or short) the financial asset when the model price is higher (or lower) than the market price.  The rational pricing is to describe a model price in that an apparent gap between two model prices of different time horizon, for example current and 1 year later, shall not appear.
If a model's 4-years-later model price will double (or halve) the current price and sound too good (or bad) to be true, this model price is not rational pricing; if that will be indeed the case and sufficient people hold this theory, why not a huge long (or short) position and then the current market price should be adjusted at the first place to nullify the "will double (or halve)" statement.
A theory of rational pricing example in bitcoin is [here]( but noting data there is out of date and bitcoin is defined as coins recorded in all significant chains and price/mining power as sum of all the three chains to be neutral on the final winning chain if any.
Rational pricing has nothing to do with Austrian economics.

Knowing that it could be the fiat is depreciating or the money is appreciating or both, measure money's price in term of fiat is not wise.  Because money's real term price is proportional to K / V where K is the energy power work to maintain the trust and V is the volume, thanks to the property that energy is conserved and cannot be created from thin air, it suffices to keep the moneys' number proportional to its volume to keep the wealth if there is no special view or speculation toward each money:
Let K = K1 + K2, P1 = k \* K1 / V1, P2 = k \* K2 /V2,  n1 = n \* V1, n2 = n \* V2
then  n1 \* P1 + n2 \* P2 = n \* k \* K no matter which money wins the battle.

The nature of POW is not any specific algorithm (sha256 or not) or device (ASIC or cpu), but the real physics required energy work.  Suppose all people today use CPU for mining with the same required energy input and consequently a much lower hash rate, the BTC value is the same.
However, it is difficult to monitor/evaluate/assure the real energy consumed for the POW for any specific miner.  Therefore we can only agree on one specific algorithm and even one specific same device (the most efficient device) to make sure we cost roughly the same energy for 1 BTC.

It is true in the sense that PoW is like charging a battery.  But OP is false in the sense that the finding difficulty of a typical scarce commodity is determined by Mother Nature mostly and bitcoin is not.
However, both being the constant volume, the flexibility of the energy amount of the 1.0 bitcoin battery allows bitcoin to appreciate (or otherwise) to cope with economy expansion (or otherwise) while a scarce commodity cannot support the economy if the economy is too large.  This means a scarce commodity cannot be used as money forever while bitcoin can.

For money, the demand will invite more money volume rather than higher real-term money price if the searching difficulty is kept the same by Mother Nature.  This is why the amount of rare seashells or gold was not enough as economy advances beyond a level and people find some new stuff as money rather than increase the rare seashell price.  Suppose its universal constant cost is 1.0 unit of shells at 1.0 month hardwork and the market real-term price is 3.0 month hardwork.  Then I deal with Alice that Alice searches 1.0 unit of shells for me and Bob will serve Alice 1.4 months.  I sell the shells Alice work for me in market to Bob at 2.8 month hardwork who will work for Alice and me 1.4 months; everyone is happy that surplus of Alice, Bob, me is 0.4, 0.2, 1.4.  The energy arbitrage will force the market price to the cost thanks to its "universal constant cost property". 


Without mentioning some off-topic properties (for example, easy to move, no decay, ...), ideally a currency-purpose asset is an asset with the property of constant production real-term cost (aka a horizontal supply curve) irrelevant to time and space.  Mathematically, the scarcer an asset, the more "horizontal" of its supply curve.  Gold is the store of value because scarcity contributes in a delicate way toward a universal constant production real-term cost.  But by your reply it seems to me that you don't agree "in a competitive market, the price is the marginal cost of production" and the corollary from the imposed property of "constant production real-term cost per 1.0 unit".


I don't agree in this regard with [some simple google]( and my personal experience in movie theater.  You can see a lot of "no outside food" which hints the high profit margin is simply due to monopoly.
For typical goods with increasing marginal cost of production, price is typically above average cost where price minus the average cost then times the quantity is the supplier surplus.

It looks like fiat in the sense that the more stake for Joe, the more money would eventually flow to Joe.  While in proof-of-work, assuming the coin is correctly pricing (which is KT/F as [claimed here]( all the coins eventually flows out of Joe to exchange the energy.
I think OP mentions that PoS is equivalent to a PoW after taking into account the cost of "punish" or "rent seeking".  Say, the "marketing legal price" of USD is "30M Joules for 1.0 USD" (assuming 1.0 kwh is 0.12 USD) and its mining cost (preparing the base materials for the coins, for example) of equivalent PoW is "1M Joules for 1.0 USD" and after taking into account the "policing cost" against the fraud/counterfeit the PoW is "10M Joules for 1.0 USD" which is less than 30M and "more efficient" as claimed by the PoS proponent, then there is either 20M Joules accumulating in the stake holders or someone can spend 10M+ Joules (including mining the base materials and bribing the police) to take the profit of 20M- Joules.
Historically, the money appeared as the PoW coin where people can not fake the effort to dig the gold or search the shells.  However, their searching difficulty and PoW is determined by Mother Nature.  As economy advanced and the demand of the money increased and the money's price (PoW) was constant, the volume which is also determined by Mother Nature was not enough.  Therefore, people invented the fiat where the fiat's PoW was secured by some artificial laws such as death penalty for counterfeit (which increases the cost for 1.0 paper to the cost for 1.0 the original sound money, for example).  PoS is muddy; things went well until one day the government realized that it could be sneakier in these PoW effort, the rest is the history we all know where the biggest stake holders are always the government or its criminal complicity.
Understandably, since PoS and PoW are equivalent, they share the same phenomenon: 51% stake holders and 51% miner.  Joe may claim it is a bless (if he belongs to the winer coalition) or it is a weakness (if he belongs to the loser coalition).

Let’s design a sound money in a thought experiment.
The axiom of purchasing power is to pay the same amount of money to boil water in a remote past and future; recall the middle school physics that to heat 100g water from 25C to 100C requires the same amount of energy always.  In other words, being a sound money, 1.0 coin shall represent a constant amount of energy always.
Economy can not be advanced without more or efficient energy input and this is why a modern worker is richer than a landlord hundred years ago thanks to industry revolution.  Currently, the energy per capita of the world is around 70G Joules per year which is also a measure of current worldwide economy size.  Since 1.0 coin's value is constant, money volume shall increase/decrease to be compatible with better/worse economy condition.  
By Paris's agreement, people shall eventually use the constant energy influx from the Sun instead of harvest energy from the "ancient energy container" coal and petro.  Since only constant energy available yearly, the economy size can not change in the measure of energy, therefore the sound coin for the economy shall be constant volume and allows a speculation period for people to find the final correct price because no one is sure how big the economy could be.
The sound coin's value doesn’t need the approval of an authority because it is done by proof-of-work meaning "a public understanding of energy amount to get 1.0 coin" which is also the public understanding of the energy amount to fake 1.0 coin.  Seasonally, coin value may appreciate/depreciate value in summer/winter due to better Sun light in summer.  But years over years and with better battery technology, its value is stable.  At the same time, Tesla may set up subsidiary in different countries and maintain a centralized so-called Teslacoin whose 1.0 coin represents 1.0 kwh and people can fund their account by electricity generators to handle micro payment or scale issues locally.  When Joe migrates to another country, he exchanges the local Teslacoin to the global sound coin.  Both Teslacoin and the sound coin are sound by design, however Teslacoin is more centralized and less secured (Musk being bad someday?) and the sound coin is more secured and more valuable.  Currently, 1.0 bitcoin represents 2.186E+12 Joules by a guess in arbitrage-free pricing.
Ok, talking too much.  But my point is: "do we really need all the stuff Average Joe praises, the central bank, the inflation of money, the... to have a sound economy ?"

For currency-purpose asset, cost is price.
Suppose an ancient indian tribe where people (except Charlie) have the understanding that to get 1 rare seashell one need to search along the beach for 1.00 month and rare seashells are used as money.
Since Charlie feels disgusting about rare seashell being the money, he thinks a rare seashell is only worth 0.01 month labor service.  Now Alice comes to Charlie and has a deal "Charlie gives Alice one rare seashell, and Bob will do the labor work for Charlie for 0.01 month".  Alice then gives the one rare seashell to Bob who is a rare seashell searcher and has a deal "Alice gives one rare sea shell to Bob and Bob only need to work for 0.90 month under command of Alice instead".  Bob feels happy because he can have 0.10 month for vacation during the next month.  Among the 0.90 month work Bob needs to commit, Alice tells Bob to work for Charlie 0.01 month and work for Alice 0.89 month.  This is an energy arbitrage simply due to ignorance of Charlie and everyone is happy. 
The other case of proof-of-work is 1 month and the price is 10 month per rare seashell, do you want me to elaborate or think for yourself ?

This is correct and the banking system shall be.
The crime of fractional reserve banking is to "add amount of apple with amount of banana together" where Alice claims she has 3g gold even she lend out 1g already.

Interesting study.
But I think it is possible to be more profit to focus on the gap in some case.
The finding time of a mining rig is almost an exponential distribution with pdf g \* exp( -g \* X ). The 1st-order statistic of a set of N mining rigs is with pdf g \* N \* exp( -g \* N \* X). Suppose Alice have N mining rigs and all other people have M mining rigs, then the probability of her finding block is Pr( X &lt; Y ), as fairly expected, N / ( N + M ). Let B be the number of nonce satisfying the block, Alice will find B \* N / ( N + M ) nonce with N rigs. The 'ROI' for Alice and other people is always the same as B / (N+M).
On the other hand. If Alice focus on a gap of nonce with portion A and other people focus on the other portion for whatever reason, then the number of nonce that she will find is now B \* A \* Pr (X&lt;Y) and the number of nonce that other people will find is B \* (1-A) \* Pr(X&gt;Y). It is B \* A \* N / (N+M) for Alice and B \* (1-A) \* M / (N+M) for others. The 'ROI' for Alice and others will be BA/(N+M) and B(1-A)/(N+M) respectively, which Alice is in a favor if A &gt; 1-A. 
For example, from block 40000 \~ 80000 as indicated in the graph, the gap is so wide that the word 'gap' is funny, but any way, we can see that the gap has roughly 80% nonce space. Alice could make a fortune because the buggy focus of other people.
Extremely, if the mining rig would be so buggy that it only tries 10 nonce and repeat by its factory default which people don’t care to change, Alice would earn all the profit.

Two cents here.
1. The stock analog is not quite correct because the bitcoin value, not like a Tesla stock, is linked to the energy consumption behind it.  If you calculate the energy amount for 1.0 coin (after the fork it might be 1.0 BTC plus 1.0 BCH because miners switching), it is a much stabler number than BTC/FIAT on daily or even monthly basis where too much speculation and volatile.  See [here]( for the physical price analysis.  If the price would reach the "correct" number instantly, the BTC/energy number would be stable other than miners' jump in and out.  At that time, it will be no fun for investment (having a gain in real term) as you mentioned.  BUT, before that, we need the fun parts (investment or hedge inflation) for public education purpose.
2. Currently due to internet infrastructure, bitcoin can't be "day-to-day" transaction currency easily; this could improve hopefully.  Or, states might jump in mining and bitcoin becomes the reserve on which fiat is issued, then fiat is no different than bitcoin (other than buying drug and you have to trust the reporting M1 data from the states).

Based on my reading about history and economics and environment, I tend to agree ideas by the [source]( and define the "living standard" as energy per capita and economic growth as the increase of its numerator;  a worker of modern age is quite more wealthy than a king of 16th century simply because people know how to harvest more energy (primarily from ancient solar energy battery, the coal and petro).  Also, I credit this [source]( as my definition of sound money then you can start reasoning about your asking all down the road easily as described there.
Basically the answer is:
* Saving interest rate is zero
* Risk-free lending rate is the lending rate a bank will charge for the borrower who will never default.
* Typical lending rate is risk-free lending rate plus risk-premium rate; the more risky, the higher.
* No much mind bothering about growth or recession and money supply.
Just imagine all people have three accounts in Tesla with kwh balance.  One for saving which Tesla can never move to other customers.  One for lending which Tesla can give a tiny risk-free interest and one will never lose any principal but also one can not move during a timeframe.  One for risky lending or investment which one will possibly lose principal but earn a lot more interest rate.  Economic growth/recession is simply the total Tesla energy inventory increases/decreases.  Whenever a person turns on the microwaves, he enjoys the life and his Tesla balance is decreasing.  If people live in a sustainable way by consuming within the energy budget offered by the Sun at 342.5W per meter^2 (0.25x of perpendicular influx), people live, or people die unless there is additional energy source.  An unappealing corollary is that people shall not grow economics forever if living by sustainable energy.  A good news is any money with finite volume will be sound if people only live by constant energy influx (typically, the Sun).

Money in fact represents energy.  It is simply an extension of law of energy conservation into civilization.  The value of the money is therefore the proof-of-work of its production.  Currently, the value of bitcoin is 3.8661E+012 joule for a block.  Depending on how long a miner plan to run the business and receive the block rewards and fee thereby, the value of 1.0 bitcoin can be estimated.

People have a myth that quantum entanglement can "transmit information at infinite speed or from future to the past".  This is incorrect.  Although the observation results at the two different spots are correlated, yet the observer can not have a statistical significance by the effect of the remote observer setting.
For example, let u be a uniform01 random variable, the 0 or 1 observation at spot1 who sets the A is the random variable if(0.5 &lt; u &lt;= 1, 1, 0) and the 0 or 1 observation at spot2 who sets the B is the random variable if(0.5 * (sin(A-B))^2 &lt; u &lt;= 0.5 + 0.5 * (sin(A-B))^2, 1, 0).  Both are correlated but observer at spot1 can never estimate B without knowing the observed data at spot2.

By google, the production cost of platinum and gold are around USD 975 and USD 700 and market price are currently around USD 970 and USD 1300.  In a competitive market, the price is the marginal cost of the production.  While platinum is justified, gold is not.  The only logical explanation must be one of the following:
* gold market is oligopoly (big holder such as central banks have strong power to manipulate)
* gold market is currently in bubble or a pyramid scam
In fair comparison cases, the scarcity does contribute to higher price for money-purpose asset.  In fact, the scarcity helps to establish a universal understanding of the cost of the production of that asset mathematically.  Then, people may use that asset as a store of value (as your link in statista: the store of value purpose of jewelry, gold bar coins, central bank purchase is a major part of the demand in gold).
In typical production of stuff, the marginal cost is increasing with the produced quantity.  However, ideally, some stuff whose marginal cost is horizontal, it is a good candidate to be the money in which whatever demand curve crosses the supply curve at the same price.

I have some difficulty to comprehend this story.  Since this is 30 years long term story and fiat is always with weird monetary policy, can you express all the price number in real term rather than $ ?  For example, to average the production cost in 30 years, 1 BTC is currently 9.376E+011 joule.  Also note that the average energy influx by Sun is only 342.5W per m^2 (1/4 of perpendicular flux) so a price number can not be too hysterical.

Suppose an ancient indian tribe where people (except Charlie) have the understanding that to get 1 rare seashell one needs to search along the beach for 1.00 month and rare seashells are used as money.
Since Charlie feels disgusting about rare seashell being the money, he thinks a rare seashell is only worth 0.01 month labor service.  Now Alice comes to Charlie and has a deal "Charlie gives Alice one rare seashell, and Bob will do the labor work for Charlie for 0.01 month".  Alice then gives the one rare seashell to Bob who is a rare seashell searcher and has a deal "Alice gives one rare sea shell to Bob and Bob only needs to work for 0.90 month under command of Alice instead".  Bob feels happy because he can have 0.10 month for vacation during the next month.  Among the 0.90 month work Bob needs to commit, Alice tells Bob to work for Charlie 0.01 month and work for Alice 0.89 month.  This is an energy arbitrage simply due to ignorance of Charlie and everyone is happy. 
Charlie and many other bitcoin haters simply shamefully forget what real money is.  Their ignorance has nothing to do with bitcoin in any way really.

It is about scale debate in bitcoin.  But never mind, for the topic in this thread about inflation/deflation, we can bypass the weakness of centralization and assume Tesla set up the Teslacoin business which we use as money happily.


Clever AI automation robots require energy to function.  Additional energy is required to refine materials generally.  An innovative genius would do hunting task instead of innovation by command of his father if the energy for the food production is not enough.  Historically, all civilization growth is accompanied with increase of disposable energy either by more harvesting or higher efficiency about energy.  It is almost an operational definition of economy growth.


Yes.  It is possible to advance economy by what you say.  However, some source of energy may change the material compositions of the environment and possible harmful in a future (the nuclear waste or coal CO2 etc.).  So, the safest sources are the ones that never change the compositions of the environment.  But this is the Paris's topic which we can agree or disagree here in this thread.  We can go for no more energy growth (therefore no economy growth) but with constant money volume.  We can also go for energy growth but with correspondent proportional money volume.  We can also prey for energy like a plague in the universe for our economy growth if we have excellent spaceships.


Not extremely long term.  Based on many global news or events of the decades, personally I think the current life style is good enough and I prefer no more energy growth in which a constant volume money is for; the coming sustainable energy is to replace the traditional sources of energy, not for increasing the total energy.  This doesn't mean bad life style, it simply means I may prefer wash the dishes by hands rather than by the machine or jog in the trail rather than in the gym.


This is where I don't understand about your argument.  While the Teslacoin has no any shortcomings (people won't get rich by holding therefore being lazy for work, people won't lose purchase power, people won't need to know mysterious rates to calculate the real wealth, people won't be fooled to become poorer in real term) and its volume is changing naturally (no need the central bank to control the volume) until people are ok with the economy size, why you desire a depreciating money?
Anyway, bitcoin will not appreciate forever, as long as the correct pricing is reached and people want to survive rather than economy growth, it will be like the Teslacoin who never appreciate or depreciate.

One borrows fiat to buy land or stock or anything with finite amount (even BTC), these finite-volume capital would be more nominal valuable due to inflation later, one can sell part of the finite-volume capital to repay the debt, that would enable them to reap the rewards of debt.
However, vast majority of debtors may borrow fiat to buy, say, a car.
The key of wise debt is whether to get the newly-printed money as soon as possible and position at finite-volume capital before these newly-printed money diffuse to the general public.

The argument about PoS and PoW really has nothing to do with cryotp.  People simply forgot/mistake what money is.  Money is all about cost of trust and the cost is in real term.  You can not tweak around proof-of-work which is part of the definition of money.  All observation about money ever appeared in history leads to the concept of proof-of-work whose definition is a public understanding about the energy amount necessarily for 1.0 coin.  Also, if you agree a good money shall be able to pay the same amount to biol 100 gram water in a remote past and future, you must agree 1.0 coin represents the same amount of energy (this is lesson by middle school physics).

No.  T2 is not meant to be for TX2, that 2 or 3 or whatever number is just an index to distinguish from each other and T; that index is simply to mean another independent variable (a variable declaration just like coding).  T is meant to be the time length of the TX1-block.  The time length of each typical block is highly unlikely the same so they will not share the same symbol in your expression although the time length of a typical block is iid of T. UNLESS you do think the time length of these block is the same.  TX2-block is somewhat special and that is why this quiz for expressing its block time by way of t and T and iid of T.
For example, the two expressions of the TX2-block time are the same (I don't say they are correct): "if T&lt;=t, t+10+T1; if T&gt;t, T2 *2" and "if T&lt;=t, t+10+T5; if T&gt;t, T3 *2"


What I meant was as follow:  imagine two parallel universes, bitcoin is designed to be 10 minutes block in universe A and is designed to be 15 seconds block in universe B.  All TXs are cloned in the two universes too.  In universe A, one TX is "0-conf and the block is not found for already 15 minutes".  In universe B, this TX is "20-conf deep TX already at minute 15".  While every objective observation is the same (the same network mining power, the same price, the same block revenue in 600 seconds, the same orphan rate, ...) except one block of universe A is 40 blocks of universe B.  You were claiming the TX in universe B is much secured than the same TX in universe A, magically.  However, allow us not to distract the quiz.  Maybe it is only a superficial symptom of the root bug.

If the tax is the same amount irrelevant to one's wealth, then the states can get be funding like a "toll bridge" for any utility service to replace the tax.
If the tax must have something to do with one's wealth, then the money system can not be anonymous.  Maybe a state can ba a LN node and all users who want to use this LN node must be identified.  You may ask what-if users don't use this state node; a state may claim all other bitcoin trades in its jurisdiction illegal unless through this node, or sadly the bandwidth of internet is not so improved that users are forced to do off-chain trades.
If no tax for the states but states still need the funding.  Maybe it is possible for this design:
Each government service agency has a donation account
People donate to all their preferred agencies (for example, someone will never donate to Pentagon because he hates it) at free will amount.  A minimum donation amount is calculated.

Then it is cheap in real term.  PoS is PoW in a complex and indirect form.
For the argument here, let's say a PoS where 1.0 coin is marketing at USD 12, assuming electricity is USD 0.12 per kwh, it means 1.0 coin is marketingly worth 100 kwh.  Also, let's say, as your wish, that 1.0 coin use 30 kwh of proof-of-work.  It is therefore highly possible some guy can trick you by costing 30 kwh and sell you the coin to take profit of 70 kwh per 1.0 coin.  In fact, fiat already plays this trick for a long time.

Good, the correct answer, 10 minutes.   This is one side of the inequality.  Before going on the other side, we need to sync some way of random variable's expression.
Say, a dice being the random variable, D, possibly 1, 2...6 and you have one dice, and a deck of cards being the random variable possibly 1, 2, ...13 and you have two decks S1 and S2; the index 1 or 2 simply means the two decks are iid (independent and identically distributed) random variables of S.  You realize a random variable of a number in 1..13 by the rule "if you throw the dice and get 1 or 2 then pick a card in S1, if you throw the dice and get 3, 4, 5, 6 then pick a card in S2".  You express the random variable by the expression:  “if D=1 or 2, S1; if D=3..6, S2”.  Get it?
Now, you are the miner.  A double spender may come to ask for your help at any unexpected time t which may be 1 or 30 or 300 or whatever minute; the double spender, being scammed, may think TX1 is "right TX" till he finds himself being scammed later at any time t and he changes his mind to define TX2 the "right TX" and TX1 the "wrong TX" since minute t. Let T be the block time random variable in the previous quiz.  Let's forget about compensation for a while, just think the spender being your dear friend who you are willing to help about the TX2.  What is the expression of random variable of the block time of the coming TX2-block?

You are wrong.  You need them for the expression of whatever question.  Say, (nothing about the topic of current comment thread) "what is the minutes at which the 10th block will be found?"  The correct answer is T+T1+T2+...+T9, not 10*T.  If you have no these iid variables, you cannot have the correct answer.


eh?  Do you forget the definition of T and its iid T1, T2, ...?  They are time length for a block finding on top of the previous block, nothing "per transaction".


You cannot get away from truth.  You could say P and its iid P1, P2, .... but that is simply meaningless being a change of symbol in the discussion.


The "hardon" is simply to avoid misunderstanding about your answer.  No other specific purpose.

And I have stated multiple times too that tiny "greater than" or “literally 1 Satoshi” (which is "tiny-zero" in my wording and understanding of your intention) may be not enough to compensate the committed cost about TX1.


This is logically false.  Do you have no concept of "wrong TX" in traditional fiat financial system?!  The concept of "wrong TX" has nothing to do with the underlying (block chain) technology.  It is a concept rooted in business.


The reason of so many empty blocks that appear seconds after other blocks is mainly the property of exponential distribution; search probability density in the comment thread.  When a block received by a miner, modern CPU is fast enough to clean up mempool.
 


You are talking a world without second law of thermodynamics which cannot be reality.  When you power the rigs with electricity and a hash and some heat follow, you cannot recycle the heat back to the electricity of the original amount of energy.  The nonce the rigs have tried is not a fit nonce for TX1-block template but might be a fit nonce for TX2-block template and you have no way to know it and therefore the so-called "waste" because all you can do is "remine".  "Flipping a bit is virtually no cost" doesn't mean "no compensation cost"; do you compare the cost of "put a poison in a dam" with the cost of "get the poison out of the dam"?
The chef cannot recollect the lost ingredients/flavor for your TX1 order by the same law of physics and there is no magic in (block chain) other technology neither.

google/educate yourself about T | T&gt;t and t + T1 being the same in exponential distribution.  This is one of my mention about your poor math literacy.  After that, educate/prove for yourself why constantly change of the block template doesn't change the overall average which is like a static block template since t=0.  All these are math in exponential distribution.  Miners may not be good at math and unknowingly accept their mining experience, especially when they are only mining rigs owners and are not mining node operators.  They also forget the crucial role of exponential distribution in their mining experience.  If the bitcoin protocol is changed to pick the 100th-order statistic rather than 1st-order statistic (google order statistic) of the block length time and the ratio of sigma over mean becomes 0.1 instead of 1.0, then they are doomed and they don’t know why.


Are you deaf?  don't say "we", it is only you.  Only, I agree "we are explicitly talking double spending of instant TX" if you say so.
0-conf is "casual replacement is zero cost" here.  "casual replacement is zero cost" and "committed replacement is zero cost" are different.  However, too many people including you think the both are the same because the sayer drops the adjective "casual" and "committed" dishonestly.
In the highest business level point of view, both we are beef noodle producers providing beef noodle to gourmet.  By free will, you choose cheaper beef and I choose delicious beef.  Let market decide the market share.  (in fact in the comment thread, you offer zero price for casual replacement and I offer some significant-non-zero price for committed replacement and the market is about demand of confidence of instant TX)

Yes, but T is a time length, not time mark.  Also, here T explicitly means for the TX1-block event.  If you might use many iid of that T and they don't mean for the TX1-block event, you could use T1, T2, ...etc as the random variables you need for your construction of the expression.


Yes, but t is the time mark.


Sure, I know it is incorrect as demonstrated by the T=3 and t=13 then it means "if TX1-block is found at minute 3 and your friend comes at minute 13, then the TX2-block is found at minute 16" which is laughable.  I was expressing your answer "it is T" which I don't think you mean it.


I disagree the wording "explicitly" here.  The current quiz is about the time mark of TX2-block which is a well-defined question.  It involves 0-conf, though, but not exclusively.  Essentially, you can imagine you are coding a program for the simulation of the time mark of TX2-block and you are asked to show your complete code.  People would laugh at you when you said "I cannot code this" not because your code is incorrect per se (you could simply add "if T&lt;=t, 0") but because you claim you cannot have this code.  Also, your friend might indeed come at t=13 and the TX1-block might indeed come at t=T=3, and there is indeed an answer to the quiz for this case.


It follows the same syntax of Bayes' theorem.  It is not quite a "if".  For example, S is the cards deck then "S| S is even" is {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12} which is not S whose value is {1, 2, ..., 13}.  What is the probability "S|S is even" if it is 2?  it is 1/6.  What is the probability S if it is 2?  it is 1/13.  You could think it is a sharpened random variable than the original random variable with some condition being known.  "if T&gt;t, T" and "if T&gt;t, T| T&gt;t" are the same but I would say the latter is clearer if the interpretation of a noun in a sentence is context-free.

So, you see, your futureBlocks[i].nextBlockTimeGuess() is in fact what we talk about Ti or T(i-1) which is a random value draw from its distribution.


No.  Every call of your futureBlocks[i].nextBlockTimeGuess() must return different and random value because the block time length, nextBlockTimeGuess, is different each time you draw.  There is no such notation/concept/math of "10 * distribution".


It is important otherwise you are unable to code and express your understanding about a random event.  I have given many legit (but not necessarily correct) answer about the quiz.  You could have answer like this "if T&lt;=t, T+T1+T2; if T&gt;t, T+T3".  You are asked to express two events and one of them you have done correctly: the timestamp at which TX1-block is found, it is "T" and the expectation value is 10.


If TX1-block is found at minute 3 (T is 3 by a random draw) and your friend comes at t=13, then you think the answer, the timestamp at which TX2-block will be found, is 3 ?  If you do think so, then you could have a legit answer "T".  But then I will assure you know it is incorrect by "the TX2-block must be found later than 13, how can it be 3?"


I thought the same too.  But then why you can’t have a pseudo code smoothly for the answer of the quiz with our agreed symbols and syntax?  I am not talking about the answer's correctness.  I thought we could have your answer without much burden then (if it is incorrect) I can assure you know why it incorrect and one bug in the understanding about the random or (if it is correct) the bug is somewhere in the following tests.

No.  We set T represents the random variable of TX1-block time length, remember?  its expectation value is 10, though.  Also, because its probability density is decreasing with respect to its value, it is coming sooner than later always.
So, do you want to revise your random variable expression answer about the time mark where TX2-block is found?

Claiming they are equal value is to claim all the time lengths of the blocks found are the same, which is obvious false.

I didn't notice it much.  It seems not relevant to any answer you are going to show.  I mean, at the moment about the minute mark at which TX2-block is found, what can you expect yourself any different answer given whatever "wrong TX" means or "multiple spenders" (TX1 is done by a tumbler and one of the inputs is going to be double spent)?  To the miners, it is a choice problem between two conflict TXs; they don't mind the composition of these TXs.


haha, not possible.  But this spiritual statement is meaningless as we both agree, so let's take it easy, no pressure.


I acknowledge what you mean and I interpret you mean "if T&gt;t, T|T&gt;t" (Am I correct in your meaning?).  But what-if T is 3 and t is 13,  what is your minute mark at which TX2-block is found?  Did you mean it will be found at minute 16 = 13+3? it's fine if that is what you mean, then you could add "if T&lt;=t, t+T".  Anyway, you didn't code your software complete (didn't describe the random variable complete) and therefore I am still waiting for a complete expression of your answer.

0-conf doesn't concern whatever TX is in the block.  When a geek says to you "0-conf replacement is zero cost", do you know what it really means?  Mathematically, it is the expectation of "if T&lt;=t, T; if T&gt;t, t+T1" which in exponential distribution case is the same as the random variable "if T&lt;=t, T; if T&gt;t, T" where the expectation remains 10, not longer than the expectation of typical blocks "T"; the bus does not have Joe on board (if T&lt;=t) or the bus has Joe on board (if T&gt;t).  In this 0-conf mind set, you don't care Joe on board at all, you only care the timestamp of the bus so the statement "Joe doesn't need to pay" is honestly misleading; the timestamp of the bus in this case is also not business interesting.  It might look shocking that the expectation of "if T&lt;=t, T; if T&gt;t, t+T1" is 10 even t=3000 knowing that the conditional expectation in the T&gt;t part is 3010 expensively (for Satoshi Nakamoto's sake, the conditional expectation of this T&gt;t part is 3010, not 10 you insist); the truth is that it is the other part T&lt;=t that finances this expensive part so that the overall average remains 10.  The reason that some customers may treat you as a creepy farmer by reading your advertisement is that the expectation of "if T&lt;=t, T; if T&gt;t, T" is always the same as expectation of "T" so they don't think they shall pay any bit at the first place. Essentially, talking about 0-conf is talking about void or emptiness.
The business interesting question is "how much more Joe needs to pay if the bus company commits Joe on board" and therefore related to "if T&lt;=t, t+T1; if T&gt;t, T" so we have "the timestamp expectation of this very bus is t+10" and "Joe needs to pay t more for this" as corollary.  There are other correct expressions for this 2nd quiz too.  They all represent the same random variable (you can conclude this by comparing the characteristic function; google search "characteristic function").  Answer 1, whatever happen to TX1 is irrelevant so the expression is t+T1.  Answer 2,  the block template for TX2 is re-prepared at t in case of TX1-block is found and in case of TX1-block is not found so the expression is "if T&lt;=t, t+T1; if T&gt;t, t+T2".  Whatever expression, the conditional expectation of each part is t+10.  So, a self-financing-by-each-part pricing is C(t)=t for each part.  If allowing cross-part-financing pricing C1(t) for T&lt;=t part and C2(t) for T&gt;t part, then the preference of TX2-block over TX1-block according to after-pricing lower cost is (let's go with Answer 2) expectation of "if T&lt;=t, t+T1-C1(t); if T&gt;t, t+T2-C2(t)" &lt; 10.  Simplifying, it is Pr[T&lt;=t] * C1(t) + Pr[T&gt;t] * C2(t) &gt; t.  Essentially, with t being reported by kwh meter as committed cost, it means positive profit of double-spending franchise business: Pr[T&lt;=t] * ( C1(t) - t ) + Pr[T&gt;t] * ( C2(t) - t ) &gt; 0 and C1(t) - t is the profit for the T&lt;=t part and C2(t) - t is the profit for T&gt;t part.
Now I disclose the answer of 2nd quiz and maybe possible future quiz, I can conclude something about you by my observation while I do understand everything you said but alas you don't conversely:
0. you fail 2nd quiz for irrelevant reason.
1. you fail to understand the trust model of proof-of-work crypto and you must treat the sentence "with 6 and more blocks the TX is immutable" sacred religiously.  Trust model in proof-of-work is simply the cost to rollback or to commit.  The method is no different for a TX in block already or not.
2. you have poor math literacy to think things in logical or mathematical way.  be aware, you are vulnerable to public opinion engineering.
3. although your claim "0-conf replacement is zero cost" is true, it is not helpful for your understanding about security/trust related to double spending.


See?  you don't help your desperate friend with commitment.  Call me suspicious, but I think you do plan to help your desperate friend until you find out your answer in the 2nd quiz correctly but hesitate to notify me your answer because you notice its expectation is more than 10.


At least respect my statement, do not say "we"'re explicitly talking 0-conf.  It is only you, not me.  However, I do think here the comment thread is concerning double spending especially double spending of instant TX which may or may not be 0-conf by chance.


I really don't know what is the point to calculate "if T&lt;=7, T; if T&gt;7, T | T&gt;7".  Also, if you focus on the conditional expectation of T&gt;7 part, T | T&gt;7, it is 17 more than 10 by 7.


You must be high.  Take care.  Good luck (see!  at least I can "good luck" to you socially although never mathematically/logically) to explain to your utility provider.


I have instructed all knowledge you need.  You take it as an exercise if you want.  For a 5-minutes TX and for me, no matter it is in block or not, if someone wants to double spend it, I would charge 0.75 coins because I would be a permanent mining pool operator and my cost base is totally on block fee.  Don't pay then I produce TX1-block, pay then I produce TX2-block.  I think my pool would be more popular than your pool because TX through my pool gains more confidence in shorter time even it is 0-conf.  When a TX is in your pool but not in my pool, merchants suffer longer time for confidence.

No, you never.  You always refuse putting a number on your advertisement about C1(t) (or put a universal number C(t)) and no double spender knows how to do business with you.


Do you forget for simplicity in the comment thread you are assumed to be the only mining node? And you receive TX1 first and the double spender sends TX2 later by doing:
step 0.  Query you about the how much cost you commit to TX1 already, say, already 60 seconds and it requires at least additional, say, 1.4 coins according to your advertisement.
step 1.  Craft the TX2 with additional fee, say, 1.6 coins and send TX2 to you.  Then, based on your advertisement, you shall replace TX1 with TX2.
step 2.  Sometime later, the TX2 is in the block chain and the TX1-block, if any, is orphaned.  If the mined block is found by you and it is TX1-block, the double spender can suit you; this law suit is ironic because accepting this much higher fee TX2 fits for your best interest as evidence claimed by the published advertisement, though.
If you want to generalize to two mining nodes, then the double spender simply does the above steps to the other mining node.  With your scenario, in the step 0, he finds the TX1 is not yet arrived (unlikely, because there is 60 seconds apart, but allow us for sake of elaboration), then he can choose not to do step 1 and hope his newly-crafted TX2 arrives soon or (being picky) he can choose to craft a new TX2 with tiny-zero more fee and send it directly to this slow miner and expect this slow miner to pick this TX2 rather than would-soon-arrive TX1 from the mempool; wishfully, the double spender hopes this TX2 to be mined by this miner faster than his other high fee TX2 by other miners or even this slow miner (because this slow miner receives the high-fee TX2 from other miners), but it is pure luck out of his control.
See?!  Technically you may argue no way to know which TX (TX1 or TX2) is the wrong TX.  But business is always certain about TX1 being the wrong TX.  Once the double spending market is formed, people learn in advance all term of service/advertisement of each mining nodes and the step 0~2 can be done instantly.  You cannot know the whole picture if you know only about computer science.


See?! I am talking about the compensation cost (where the chef has been already cooking for your special flavor for a length of time but you change your mind before his serving) and you are always talking about cost to cover future operation (the tiny-zero more fee) which is not about compensation I point out again and again.  I bet the chef will be very angry if you don't compensate his committed cost enough and say "hey! I pay a tiny-zero more fee for the replacement".

I only saw you mention "T - t" as the minutes after your double spender friend comes asking for your help, and I read nothing else.  The current quiz is to express the random variable of the minute mark at which the TX2-block is found.  I guess you mean "if T&lt;=t, t + T1; if T&gt;t, T|T&gt;t" for this quiz though I am not quite sure your expression.  You'd better express by yourself and do not lose any "if" not being handled just like writing a software code.
Remind you that you start mining for TX1-block at minute 0 and your friend come asking for your help at minute t and all minute mark is counted since minute 0 and T is the random variable for the time length for TX1-block.  You are genuinely helping your friend so you agree with him that TX1 is the "wrong TX" and TX2 is the "right TX".
@_date: 2019-09-11 02:33:00


Yes, T is the length and t is the timestamp (time mark).  As demonstrated in that funny statement "if T&lt;=t, t+T" where t=13 and T=3 and the TX2-block is found at timestamp 16 = 13 + 3 but the mining task with TX2 in the block template lasts 3 minutes.  Or another example: the next block on top of TX1-block will be found at timestamp T + T1 while it only mines for T1 minutes.


eh? Yes!  I thought we accept this notation already since weeks ago.


I acknowledge you said this before.  But I also pointed out I rather inquire into security of "instant TX" than that of "0-conf TX".  To me, to answer the security of "0-conf TX" pretty much resembles that you survey the cost of traveling from Paris to Madrid by hitchhiking of people's good will; you only need to pay a "tiny more" for it but this survey cannot reveal the true cost in the business sense; the sound survey shall cover all sorts of drivers and transportations.


Actually, it is "∣" not a pipe line; just for sake of easier keystrokes in the comment thread.
@_date: 2019-09-06 23:44:36


I think you mistook something.  The "wrong TX" is defined by the spender and after that, this spender needs to compensate/convince the chef or miners to accept the "right TX".  Didn't you notice the wording "accept or refuse" in my math inequality?  The chef can refuse the spender's thinking about the "wrong TX" and insist the first dish is the "right TX" simply because the spender does not compensate enough for his change of mind that the second dish is the "right TX"; the double spender says to the chef "I pay a little bit more fee already" and the chef replies "you can choose not to enjoy the first dish I am going to serve you soon, but then you still need to pay the bill of the first dish".  In this context, the first dish is the "wrong TX" but the compensation does not pass the chef's math inequality and the convince is a failure and eventually the first dish is recorded as the "right TX" in the accounting system although the double spender thinks it is "wrong TX".  However, the chef needs both the concepts of the spender's "wrong TX" and "right TX" to formalize the math inequality. 


I will go a quiz by quiz approach to assure which math you lost.
At minute 0, the spender sends TX1 and the miner starts mining about TX1.  The miner ignores anything the spender is going to say/do, if any.  What is the average cost in term of minutes for the coming block which is a TX1-block?
Your answer is?
@_date: 2019-09-21 00:57:56


I claimed and claim that 0-conf would be safe if the double spending market would be formed.  I also claimed and claim that 0-conf and 1-conf is currently not safe because people are not assured economically whether the TX1 would be replaced or not.  Why you are still confused about my position after such a long comment thread is mysterious to me.
In a sense the word "0-conf" is very confusing.  If it means a TX which is not in a block yet at timestamp 3, then the timestamp expectation of the coming block having this TX is 3+10, but then many people including you have the mind set "timestamp expectation still at 10 not 13", so 0-conf cannot possibly be this definition in this regard.  This is why I discourage the wording of 0-conf and instead encourage the wording of instant TX which could be in a block already (T&lt;=t) or not (T&gt;t).  As mentioned, the "0-conf TX replacement is X cost" is about the expectation of "if T&lt;=t, T; if T&gt;t, t+T1" which is the timestamp of a block not necessarily having TX2 and this is not interesting in business sense.


Grant. I know you said it already so I was not referring to your thinking anyway.  What I meant is that, with that 40000 coins TX example, if it is 1-conf (typo in my previous comment where it reads "6-conf" but conceptually the same) in a short time, say, 10 seconds, then the committed cost is only 10 sec electricity so this TX is not safe and could be easily double spent with that huge 40000 coins budget for the double spending task; the trust about the TX1 has nothing to do with its being 1-conf or even 6-conf or 0-conf but solely to do with the cost the double spender needs to pay the mining node to commit TX2.

I was just to make sure the way of our expression about random variable.  You can write down what you think about the minute mark at which TX2-block is found by the very expression.  Your expression doesn’t have to agree with the truth per se, but simply a way of expression.  After that, if there is any breach between your answer and the truth, I can assure what math you are missing and show you.  BTW, one notation forgot to mention, if you like to use in this quiz: a pipe line | means "conditional", for example "S|S is even".
Still waiting for your expression of this quiz.  Keep in mind, your answer doesn't need to be the truth but simply an expression that no mutual understanding occurs.

t, the timing of your friend coming, has nothing to do with the distribution of typical block time length T (and all its iid) and therefore the timestamp of TX1-block.  But t does have some impact on the timestamp of TX2-block.  Remember the quiz is about the timestamp of TX2-block.  Also remember we set T to represent the block time length of TX1-block, so the timestamp of the TX1-block is 0+T and the timestamp of the block on top of TX1-block is 0+T+T1 which cannot be the timestamp of TX2-block because TX2-block is not on top of TX1-block.  Did you not understand the mentioned logical proof of "the distribution of TX2-block timestamp cannot be the distribution of T"?


Yes, all typical blocks have the same distribution of block time length.  As mentioned, the time length of TX1-block is T, the time length of the block on top of TX1-block is T1 which is iid of T.


Essentially, your advertisement/term of service being a double-spending service provider is "If you pay me 0.0000001 more fee then I will replace your TX1 with TX2 sometimes and I don't commit to mine a TX2-block".  Knowing that so-called "market" is always to exchange something with some other thing with commitment, your TOS will be nonsense to customers because people might think "What the hell is this advertisement, if he doesn't have the commitment to do my job, I surely never pay him any bit at the first place".  This is what I mentioned to you the analogy "hitchhiking" or the creepy "farmer".  At t=3, there is 26% probability of "no deliver" of your service.  You are not helping the formation of the market; you would better leave the farmer market bazaar and allow the genuine service providers come to satisfy the demand in the market.  Any genuine service providers will go through the 2nd quiz because they need to assess the cost to set the price of their service.  If you are a genuine service provider and you assess the cost wrong, Darwin will weed you out.  On the other hand, you could never provide the service, knowing that if the distribution of block time length is precisely the exponential distribution, you could live with your DEF2 approach with that 0.0000001 without any commitment, bearing the risk that "precisely" means "fragilely" sometimes.  Also, you would agree what the genuine service providers say because you are happier to accept TX2 with much higher fee than 0.0000001 fee, but the genuine service providers would not agree what you say because they think 0.0000001 is too cheap.  After all, market will come to a position which is more attractive in business sense.  You think nothing is wasted simply because you don't have commitment.


haha, bird of a feather flocks together?  well, allow me just a step back, I think many parts of the crypto are currently not mature enough in business sense.  A business's profit is franchise oriented, never speculation oriented.  Knowing that currently major profit is always speculation and the market (the crypto/fiat stuff) is still trying to find the price, I think the topic of the current comment thread is too early.  That said, the claim “instant TX will never be safe without software change” is false as explained and this is why I engaged this comment thread at the first place.


Well, I understand many parts of the crypto, including 0-conf, much more than most people.

Exactly.  In fact, you are just describing "if T&lt;=3, 3+T1; if T&gt;3, 3+T2" which is the same as answer of my asking about the TX2-block timestamp.  At now()==3, there are two possibility for the TX1: the block could be found already before t=3 or not.  The only difference is that, even you don't replace TX1 with TX2 now (t=3), the block having TX1 is with random 3+T1, just like the TX2-block timestamp if you commit to have a TX2-block.
Say, let’s forget about the double spending situation, you can have 1000 trials of TX-block timestamp, the average is 10, but 13 for those trials whose T is beyond 3.


I totally understand hitch-hiking is free.  But are we interested in cost analysis of hitch-hiking?  And my position is that hitch-hiking is not the interesting question of the comment thread.


Some contradiction here I think:  "I'm not going to accept an invalid transaction" (here "invalid" TX2 means TX1 is already in a block, am I correct?) and "I check the fee on TX2 and if it can't cover the expected cost of rewriting TX1-block, I ignore it".  TX2 could be invalid but with sufficient additional fee convincing your rewriting TX1-block, especially when the TX1-block timestamp is only 6 seconds and the block reward is 100 blocks away in the future.

You know deep in your heart you are saving your face, otherwise you could have bravely set a C1(t) and C2(t) or simply a C(t) if you really think you are correct.  Or, you still don't understand the math behind.
Being a double spender, he defines TX1 to be the wrong TX1 and sets a compensation price to convince you in favor of TX2 than TX1.  Miners will accept TX2 simply because it is over all more profit with the said compensation: in math, t &lt; Pr\[T&lt;t\] \* C1(t) + Pr\[T&gt;=t\] \* C2(t)
\&gt; There is no cost associated with dropping transactions, swapping transactions or adding transactions. Any work done on any subset of transactions (provided they aren't internally conflicting) doesn't waste energy and is no different than doing work on any other subset (provided there aren't internal conflicts).
This was mentioned already and this is true; search TXa TXb.  BUT TX1 and TX2 is internal conflict; search meaningless memo.  The work on top of either TX1 or TX2 must be wasted and the "wrong TX" is defined by the spender's intention even multiple blocks on top of the wrong TX are found; search 10000 pizza.  Why miners accept (or refuse) TX2 than TX1?  because it is more (or less) profit with the said compensation: t &lt; (or &gt; ) Pr\[T&lt;t\] \* C1(t) + Pr\[T&gt;=t\] \* C2(t).
\&gt; If you swap at the 1 minute mark (since last block) or the 3 or the 9:55 mark, you'll still find blocks in line with the 10 minute average (swapping the transaction won't reset the "10 minute" timer).
At minute 0, why do you think the 100% future world is in T&gt;=t?  You don't have a complete cost equation to reach the rational decision; search reach minute 3, the scenario of T&lt;3 is of 0.2592 probability and you ignore it bluntly.  If T turns out to be 3, the "swapping at 9:55 mark" vanishes in your mind because you only think of the world of DEF2; this is your blind spot and I mentioned a lot already.

So, your answer is "if T&lt;=t, T; if T&gt;t, T" or "T10" as the TX2-block found timestamp, am I correct in your answer? Then your answer is obviously false because the following reasoning.  Suppose your friend comes at minute 13.  Knowing that the expectation of the random variable expression "if T&lt;=t, T; if T&gt;t, T" is 10 and the TX2-block can only be possibly found beyond minute 13, this means the expectation value of the correct answer of the quiz is at least 13, contradiction to being 10.


If you define work as hash work presented by the accepted hash value of the block, then yes, 0-conf doesn't have any work to be undone.  But as I mentioned to you, the correct definition of the "work" in the concept of proof-of-work is in fact energy work, then no, the TX in both universe A and B spends the same 15 minutes energy work already.  You just cannot let go the committed cost reported in the kwh meter easily in both universe A and B.

Didn't we?  By that t=13 example, how can the distribution of TX2-block timestamp (whose expectation is &gt;13) be the same as the distribution of TX1-block timestamp (whose expectation is 10 less than 13).


No, I try to explain but it seems you stuck in some brain bug.  Look, I am like a medical doctor who provides volunteer clinic on your illness.  You can choose not to come to the diagnostics and live your life in old fashion way and Darwin will show you the answer eventually.  Or you can be modest to accept some tests and know what's going on in your brain. 


No, you don't yet answer a simple quiz about the timestamp of TX2-block which is crucial to assess the bug in your brain.


As mentioned, (you don't recognize you are hitchhiking), it is because your reasoning is incorrect.  It is really weird that you don't recognize your work on TX1-block is wasted when you are helping to have a TX2-block for your dear double-spending friend.


You can go asking anyone about this quiz too.  Unless the one is saving face or totally illiterate in math, he can answer it correctly and quickly.
@_date: 2019-09-11 15:44:13


No, this is the confusion you shall avoid.  Here we explicitly use T for the TX1-block in the expression.  For other typical blocks, you could say their time length are T1, T2, ...which are iid of T but you shall not say "they are T"; just like you cannot use the same (global) variable declaration in your code about time length of TX1-block and other blocks.  UNLESS, as demonstrated in that funny example of t=13 and T=3 where you do think the TX2-block will be found at 16 then you can use the same variable T and express the TX2-block timestamp as t+T.


Note that what I mean "instant" might be not so much instant in time length. I simply mean it is not necessarily only for the case T&gt;t because the most possible T you could observe is near zero (the highest probability density of exponential distribution is near zero) and t can be such that T&lt;=t.  At timestamp t, say 10 seconds, all your friend want is to double spend TX1 and he doesn't care it is 0-conf or not.


We can talk about the statement's true or false later after your answer of this current (2nd) quiz where I can be sure "the bug in your brain lies after the 2nd quiz or in the 2nd quiz".  But don't you think you place the "number of confirmation" in a spiritual/religion position?  If we change the average block time to 15 seconds (and block size, block reward become x1/40 too) so that this 0-conf and 15-minutes TX becomes a 20-conf TX, then it magically becomes more secured although the world in Joe's eyes doesn't change a bit?


It may not be your fault to think this way; the white paper and the software mention the "work" in the proof-of-work as "hashing work".  But this definition is wrong or misleading witnessed by the fact that double of rig efficiency (and therefore the double of hashing work) doesn't double the cost of mining attack and the real security of the network and the price/cost of the coin as long as the whole network has the same energy bill.  The work shall be the same definition of work in physics which is the energy work, the kwh Joule stuff.  In a world of no rig efficiency improvement, these two are the same, though.  In a world where the money follows axiom of purchasing power (search axiom in the comment thread), money's price in term of energy work is constant and money behaves like a battery and its purchasing power behaves like the energy amount in the battery.
@_date: 2019-09-28 04:58:24


Let's set the definition of 0-conf is TX not yet in a block here.  Hitch-hiking is like a no-commitment or 0-conf.  The random variable expression is "if T&lt;=t, T; if T&gt;=t, t+T1" which has also 1-conf part and 0-conf part but no service commitment in 1-conf part however.  The business interesting problem is to travel from city A to city B; analogically, there is always some probability Pr(T&lt;=t) that a person finds no good-will drivers and fails traveling from city A to city B.  Taking into account of this for the sake of service commitment, then the random variable expression becomes "if T&lt;=t, t+T1; if T&gt;=t, t+T2" where both 1-conf and 0-conf scenarios also exist but then a totally different cost.  It would be easier to avoid misunderstanding by associating cost to the random variable expression rather than to the "x-conf" wording; you see, with x-conf wording:
1. both expressions have 0-conf part but one has zero cost and the other has t cost
2. the conditional expectation of 0-conf part of the both expressions are t+10
3. the expectation of first expression is 10 and the expectation of second expression is t+10
Confusing like a hell I would say.


Yes, this is related to 1-conf.  As mentioned, the highest probability density of exponential distribution is around zero block time length so 6 seconds block is in fact more likely than 600 seconds block if you have a sampling graph of every second (or every 6 seconds).
"100 blocks away" is that miners never get the reward at block found time immediately.  All coinbase coins are spendable after 100 blocks deep.  Therefore, if a miner is bribed with more than 0.14 coins ( =6/600 * 14 ), in such a long time 6 + 100 * 600 seconds of average, it is in fact more profitable than saying "hell no!  I have just mined that 14 coins and I don't want to give in to it".

As mentioned, if you casually change any TX before the block is found, the expected timestamp of the block is still 10.  But if you commit to have a TX2-block before the block is found, the expected timestamp of the block is 13.  Anyway, this confusion is always my concern to the typical persons in crypto community about their usage of the wording "0-conf" and their mindset of expected timestamp at 10; the both are not compatible so I don't know why the both can hold true in their brains and then I tend to doubt/laugh at messages coming from their mouths.  If you define "0-conf TX" as the TX not yet in a block, then the expected timestamp of the block having that TX is indeed t + 10, not 10.  Try to do the trials of "if T&lt;=t, T; if T&gt;t, t+T1" to see what this means.  With t=3, there are 26% trials in T&lt;=3 part and 74% trials in T&gt;3 part, the average is 10.  But if you count only T&gt;3 part whose block has TX2, the average is 13.  You can also do the trials by "re-prepare" the block template every 10 seconds and have the same result.

I see a world where a majority of node operators DO NOT have that double spending franchise business which is the current world where 0-conf (in fact all instant TX) is not safe.  I also vision a world where a majority of node operators have the double spending franchise business where 0-conf (in fact all instant TX) is safe.  What is the problem with this statement?  Isn't it a violation of "people who think 0-conf transactions are, ever were, or ever will be part of bitcoin are tragically misled" in my first engaged comment?
Your stuck in 0-conf rather than instant TX will make you believe this trade  is safe at 6-conf in current world.  This is terribly wrong.


This sentence is not what I think; the wording "therefore" is weird.  The committed resource has nothing to do with 0-conf or 1-conf.  As long as the kwh meter is running, you commit resource already.  As to the "committed replacement", I do keep your desperate friend in mind than almost all current miners including you, in which the committed resource is wasted in my eyes accordingly.


Didn't I? I replied it already.  It depends on the double spender pays me more than 0.75 coins then I produce TX2-block.  Note that I don't care when the block will be coming (your setting of "a block is coming in 5 minutes"), I only care how long I have committed my electricity already (your setting of "mining for 5 minutes already"), because I plan my franchise business to be antifragile with respect to the block time length distribution assumption and I choose a universal C(t) pricing approach.

See?!  You don't have the commitment to replace TX1 with TX2 like a business man, pretty much like an apple farmer has a seat in the bazaar but when the customer comes and hands over the price specified on the tag and suddenly this farmer claims this apple is not for sale somehow; this farmer is pretty much wasting people's (producers and consumers) time in the market and shall not have the seat in the bazaar at the first place.  Mentioned already in the comment thread, here "valid" has nothing to do with crypto signature, it simply means TX2 is defined to be the correct TX and TX1 is defined to be the wrong TX and you just are too rhetorical and are trying to save face with the dishonest wording “TX1 is valid”.
@_date: 2019-09-17 07:37:38


ehh?  I never agree "t cannot be &gt;= T"; could you point out where I said that in this comment thread.  Recall the definition of t (the timestamp at which your friend comes) and the definition of T (the timestamp at which TX1-block is found); how can you constrain your friend ask for your help always when his wrong TX is including in the block or not.  t could be &gt;=T in one day as well as &lt;T in another.


"all typical blocks have the same distribution of block time length", not "all blocks".  By typical blocks, it means the blocks whose birth has no intentional delay such as our quiz story.  TX2-block is not a typical block, it can only be found after timestamp t while a typical block's block time length follows the exponential distribution which could have 6-sec block less than the timestamp at which your friend comes.  This quiz is simply to express the TX2-block timestamp.  T1, T2, T3,....are iid of T, it means they all have the same distribution but they are different realization.  All these notation symbols follow math practice and I didn't invent anything bizarre.  You still cannot hand out an expression for the timestamp of TX2-block?
Btw, could you show me your asking of a friend?  I still think it is unlikely for a typical educative person not knowing this answer of the quiz and I wonder what your asking and his answer are.  This 2nd quiz is essentially the same question asking the bus's coming timestamp when Joe shows up at timestamp t and the bus is required to have Joe on board.


You don't deliver TX2-block 100%.  You say to the customer sometimes "TX1-block is found and I don't help".  If you do commit the delivery of TX2-block, you will recognize the whole cost and you will claim in your advertisement "you can sue me if the block is mined by me and it is TX1-block" but you dare not.


If you commit to have TX1-block, then the work on TX2-block is wasted.  If you commit to have TX2-block, then the work on TX1-block is wasted.  Your problem is that you don't have commitment.


0-conf is never a business interesting stuff; people are more interested in the confidence that TX2 is refused and accepted.  Until the double spending market is formed, instant TX will never be safe.  Likewise, until the double spending market is formed, 6000 coins hack will never be rollback.


You never know what will happen at t=7.  If you experiment 1000 trials, roughly 500 trials TX1-block is found which you may need to pay a huge fee to double spend your TX2, also, roughly 500 trials TX1-block is not found which you may be happy that the miner, being your like-mind, only requires almost zero more fee and switch your TX2 with TX1.  What is the average fee you think you will have to pay for your TX2 after the 1000 trials?  Now think as if you are the miners, "why do I need the whole large number of 1000 trials and its large number effect to help me survive my business rather than I charge all the same average fee in every trial so that I don't need to endure the whole 1000 trials to be blessed by the luck?"  You agree you commit 15 minutes energy work in both universe A and B, remember?  Why is some trial with positive profit and some trial with negative profit?  Why cannot all the trials be with the same profit?


The real world is always changing as people are more educated; today people don't know/bother to handle double-spending and stuck in the concept of 0-conf.  How do you think Jamie Dimon say to you "Real business is done by fiat and your crypto sucks.  This is real world!"?

Are you deaf or bot?  We have mentioned again and again that "valid" means nothing in the comment thread.  You also totally interpret wrongly the apple farmer analogy where I meant we agree the business "TX2 will replace TX1" with whatever price you set on the tag but then you somehow spend useless work on TX1 and say "here is your block".
After you are told TX1 is the wrong TX, why can't you, just being like a typical business man, admit you were mining wrongly?  And charge any number you see in your kwh meter related to TX1 for compensation which has been published in the term of service / advertisement?

Follow this definition.  Let's TX1 be 0-conf and TX2 appears at t=3, then why you said the TX2-block is expected to be found at t=10 or why the mind set of 10 for 0-conf?  While the TX2-block is mathematically expected to be found at t=13.  The only case I have a "10" is the expectation of "if T&lt;=t, T; if T&gt;t, t+T1".

Let's say it is 1.5.
Then it follows the fee per TX is 1.5 / 600 / N where N is TX per second constrained by the block size limit.  It can never go lower sadly and it is 0.000357.  Or, to have 1E-08 fee, N shall be 250k which can only be feasible when that 32GB block is feasible.

The only reason of fiat is all about government funding, (over table) tax or (under table) personal wealth devaluation in favor of national debt.  Assuming bitcoin wide adoption, government would face difficulty about this purpose so there are only two possibility distinguished by who come to first realize the rationale behind bitcoin: the people, or the government.
First scenario, people first.  In a democracy government, the people would prevent the government from criminalizing bitcoin.  The government funding is therefore only possible by a reasonable tax and selling government bonds only to whoever is willing to buy.  No more printing money, the M1 volume would be proportional to the energy storage and capped.  As long as you are not buying something illegal, no much difference of holding bitcoin or fiat.  What a wonderful world.
Second scenario, government first.  In this scenario, government realizes funding would be so difficult that bitcoin would be criminalized; domestic miners and holders and users are all illegal.  There might be some miners/users accessible by tor or being foreign, however bounty would be offered to power plants and tax office and even people to get these criminals down.  Holding and using bitcoin would be risky if your address was known to government decade ago (now).
So the answer of "does it matter if the government knows we own BTC" is in fact related to your bet about these two possibility.
And this may be off-topic, but the best action you can do may be something like a preacher, talking and explaining the bitcoin rational to others around you to increase the first scenario probability and the chat is never started by "I invest 1000 fiat and now I get 10000 fiat".

Miners are the consumers of energy and the producers of the trust token.  Being a miner, the desire to have lambo in a future will encourage Joe to create the cheap energy source which is highly possibly clean if he installs the energy source in his house because no one likes his house dirty; or collectively, if the energy power of a single Joe is not enough to run a mining rig, a community sets up a mining rig and using the energy source from multiple Joes, for example.  The block reward halving will also guarantee not all these newly-developed energy sources are mining forever; when the mining business ends, Joe naturally adds an additional clean energy source to support the society to which fossil energy was supporting and can be retired.  Not being a miner, the desire also helps Joe to reduce his typical consumption such as luxury foods or to bike to work instead of drive-to-work.

1.  Announce to all miners: "To compensate your already-committed work in the current chain, I will pay the fee 14 coin for each block following my double-spent 7000 BTC till the length of my preferred chain is longer than that of the chain with the hacked transaction".
2. My first transaction: addr1 7000 --&gt; addr1 6986 in the first block.  My 2nd transaction addr1 6986 --&gt; addr1 6972 in the 2nd block. ....etc
The self-interest miners suffice; those miners will mine the block with 14+12.5+other transaction fees benefit instead of the normal (old chain) 12.5+other transaction fees
In fact, miners shall have already had a pricing table based on the delay-time for those coins who are double spent.  No need the stupid "pre-consensus".  Also, merchants can simply check that table to avoid double-spent coin; when the double-spent cost is higher than the merchant sale price, the goods/service can be delivered, no need to wait for blocks confirmation.

Here in this thread, what I mean "miner" is the owner of a mining node, not the owner of mining rigs.


Knowing that this announced action is not bluffing (who on earth is willing to miss 7000 BTC than to miss 2800 BTC?), if you own a mining node, which chain will you choose to mine?


With sufficient (possibly a huge amount) work, nothing is immutable.  In fact, I tend not to use this word in bitcoin since it is like a religion; I would like to go with the concept of "cost of rollback".

It is not logical that “double spending to reclaim a scammed 0.1 BTC with fee 0.04 BTC” is different than “double spending to reclaim a scammed 7000 BTC with fee 2800 BTC”. Trust in bitcoin is the cost to roll back, nothing to do with the number of confirmations. Mining nodes should have had a pricing table about additional fee for double spending. 1 BTC represents the cost of 600/14 seconds mining cost (assuming 1.5 block fee). If Joe is willing to compensate the cost for the miners, it is all legit and not a bail-out.  If timely, the victim can conduct the task by additional fee of 14 BTC (or more) for each block in his preferred chain to compensate the miner's loss until he runs out of the hacked coin and nothing to lose if that is the case or until his chain wins the fight and reclaims part of the disputed fund.
Let’s name the two chains, chain1 with the hack and the other chain2 without the hack. When the two chains start competing, for irrelevant transactions and users, their transactions are both recorded in chain1 and chain2 so there is no loss of trust for their transactions/coins provided by 100% proof-of-work; whatever the mining power distributes between chain1 and chain2, the innocent coins have the same stable price and currency code BTC, neutral to the fight. Coins only recorded in chain1 (let’s give its currency code BTC-whack) may be less valuable than coins only recorded in chain2 (let’s give its ticker BTC-wohack) because all the self-interest mining powers want chain2 to be true for its richer bribe and devote their mining power while some little strange mining powers bypass the self-interest for some unknown reason. Suppose BTC-wohack eventually wins, the chain1 is dead and BTC-wohack is the same currency code BTC economically and is to reclaim the ticker.
Without any intervention and change of software source code, this fight will be settled very soon at most in 600/14\*7000 seconds beyond which no rational player wants to roll back the transaction and no rational miners accepts the double spending. If the hacker owns some mining power and change the software code to invalidate the first block in chain2, so be it, its ticker is BTC-whack anyway; people need to be intelligent not to be brain-washed that “BTC-whack is BTC” or “BTC-wohack is BTC” and BTC remains the “coins recorded in both chains”.
I guess too many people are afraid of words like “split” or “reorg” because of the fear of price going south. But a true bull market is based on correct knowledge rather than fear. BTW, once people recognize/define currency ticker as coins’ ledger records than its chain, bitcoin’s price (as defined as coins recorded in all significant chains) is already now beyond 7300 USD.

In reality wealthy money never trickles down because newly generated money is not globally distributed proportional to one's stash instantly; in fact the receivers of the new money tend to be the ones complicit to the money issuer.  This is not the case for constant volume money where money appreciation is mathematically the same effect as the fair way of new money distribution in non-constant volume money.
Just like the energy of a molecule in the adiabatic bottle, the molecule energy will diffuse to other molecules and have the same average ergodicity across the time; at any cross section of time a molecule may have higher or lower energy than the average, though.

\&gt; you forgot the investment part that is needed to buy the mining rigs and to create the cheap energy that are necessary
Every miner must have done the cost analysis including the rig purchase and the mining rewards, obviously a negation to your statement.  Then when they come to consider their own energy source for more profit, they will also follow the same logic.
\&gt; it "will" happen but in 10 years of existence that behavior has never been observed
In the first halving some miners did quit mining.  In fact, from the point of view of no-arbitrage pricing, let Ki be the mining energy power of era i and F be the block fee, then the condition shall hold: K0 \* 600 /(50+F) = K1 \* 600 /(25+F) = K2 \* 600 /(12.5+F) = ... = K \* 600 /F, therefore Ki / K =  50 \* 0.5 \^ i / F +1, meaning that at the end of each era there will be some mining business ends and its energy source is therefore released to other activity.
That said, speculation doesn’t end yet (this is why "hold" profits currently) which could be a good thing since it means higher permanent K. Then in a future when people do come to rational, it means higher gap Ki - K in the future eras.

While people believe the victim has nothing to lose and therefore has a budget of 7000 BTC to do the reorg, how many BTC do you think the hacker is willing to bribe the miners if the victim now starts that every block on the other chain has 14+12.5+other irrelevant fee to the miner?

Let's imagine an altcoin with market exchange rate with bitcoin at A such that
1. The altcoin will be created when Alice escrows her bitcoin; if she escrows 0.1 bitcoin, 0.1 \* A new altcoins will be issued to her.  Similarly for Bob.
2. Alice can do many transactions with Bob in the altcoin.  Suppose after a long while, Alice shall pay Bob X altcoin overall
3. When Alice and Bob want to clear out, they both collectively clear the escrows netting the amount of X/B bitcoin where B is the market exchange rate at time of clear. The issued altcoin in step 1 are destroyed as well.
Everything is normal; this is a legit altcoin-facilitated economy activity.
But the trouble comes when the exchange rate is forced at an artificial number by the Lightning protocol design.  Every forced price is not market price, either a real price emerged from the black market or weird rent in the price formulation. If the work of watching tower costs little and cannot justify its 1.0 exchange rate against the coin volume, there must be some rent-seeking activity to balance the exchange rate; for example, an annual license fee to operate an LN node to increase the cost of the coin.
So, I would say Lightning coin is a weird coin.   With some rent seeking possibility if it really becomes a thing rather than a small scale project or luckily its small volume and its watch tower work justify its 1:1 pegged exchanged rate; denote the watch tower work by K and the time preference by q and the volume by V, the coin's price is K / qV
@_date: 2018-12-28 18:29:12
Running a lightning node is like a time deposit about time preference AND a non-stop energy work per second for watch tower K; you put aside coins V for a promised length of time and gain some interest per second q.  Let P be the coin price in term of energy, all you have to do is qVP - K &gt; 0 where you can control V and K except q which is your nature somewhat out of your control.
If you think it is a little risky to put coins in hot wallet and like to charge a risk-premium, then q' VP - K &gt; 0 where q' is higher than q by that risk-premium.

For the block reward part, a miner can simply think it as the average block reward for his business plan horizon, then there is no "jump" at a halving; say, the block reward for a miner's plan horizon is 8.0, then 4.5  is reserved for the future cost when block reward is only 6.25.  
For curve-fit part, do you mean you regress the curve on the data set, say,   with equal weight, aka equal number of deployed rigs?  Assume there are two rigs at Jan 1 2018, 20 T/s and 30 T/s, so the target hash rate at Jan 1 2018 is 25 T/s ?

Any resource is limited and has a price.  As mentioned in that comment, the definition of G is side chain block fee plus block reward (precisely, "era-averaged" block reward).  By the competition of the side chain block space, the side chain block fee can not be zero.  If G is really really tiny to be treated as zero, then the side chain space resource must be very very abundant.  The definition of centralization is "resource possession highly beyond the average of the globe".  Therefore, unless global infrastructures advance, a treated-as-zero G typically means a centralization of bandwidth/ram/disk about the side chain space, a.k.a "why not an oracle database for it".

Assuming miners can get 14 coins in mining a block,  then 7000 BTC is of 500 blocks, aka 5000 minutes.  Suppose CZ is willing to bribe the miners with 2800 BTC, then he can double spend the transaction with 2800 BTC fee to trigger a reorg of 200 blocks, in 2000 minutes.  All legit transactions are simply re-recorded and no impact.

Creating an additional 1.0 USD might take just only an electronic data increment in a database so it mustn't be that laborious.  "1.0 USD is 24M joule" is simply an equivalent statement of "1.0 kwh is 0.15 USD".  Therefore, if Joe plans a small business related to energy arbitrage and do not bother to think further, this statement is valid for calculation already.  However, if Joe really wants to find out how much joules necessary to produce 1.0 USD on average, Joe may need to do some more research.  For example, some hints are:
1. one dollar coin is made of copper and has some specific figures on the head and tail.  Therefore, Joe shall not claim that only the effort about creating the figures is the joule number for one dollar coin; Joe shall take into account the joules number from a copper miner as well. 
2. energy subsidy for power plants is common for many countries where subsidy is usually financed by tax.  Therefore possibly it is in fact "1.0 kwh is 0.25 USD" although "1.0 kwh is 0.15 USD" is on the electricity bill.
After all the research, Joe may come to a number X about "1.0 USD is X joules" which may be not that big number and Joe finally notices that 1.0 USD is not that valuable.  But as mentioned, "1.0 USD is 24M joules" is good enough for Joe's business plan without appealing to producing the counterfeit coins which is also an energy arbitrage business where the producers justify the action after taking into account all the possible cost such as being caught and losing money.  The rationale applies to aliens too.  When there is no "in god we trust" or authority, given Joe and aliens both need the same amount energy to heating that 1000ml water from 20C to 100C, Joe can play energy arbitrage against the alien coin if the exchange rate is not correct.

Bitcoin is permissionless in any way even in the upgrade you are asking.  You don't need to play politics or friended by any elite.  All you have to do is basically:
1. copy some source code and modify it according to your idea and publish your code so that other miners/people can understand what you are doing and recognize it is not vaporware.
2. you decide a block height and an initial difficulty at that block height to split the chain
3. advertise your idea in some place to attract some miners/people
4. no need for replay protection so that your chain can enjoy the network effect of the original chain
5. no need to claim your coin are the true bitcoin because it is hopeless if people don't think as you do.
6. before the split height, your mining node is running along with all original chain mining nodes and has the same block chain 
5. after the split height, your chain is different from the original chain.
Two scenarios after the split height.
First, you don't attract enough mining power and your chain is a pet chain.  Don't be sad, you can keep on mining and advertise.  Bitcoin ran for years before the first pizza.
Second, you attract significant mining power, say 10% of the original mining power.  While bitcoin is defined as coins valid in all alive chains, after the split height, the coin only valid in your chain is worth 10% of the original bitcoin and the coin only valid in another chain is worth 90% of the original bitcoin, the coin valid in both chains is the same worth of the original bitcoin and merchants are happy with the stable price of bitcoin.
Years later, if your chain gradually attracts 99.99% of mining power and another chain is obsolete then you will be proud that you said "my coin is the real bitcoin" before.  If not 99.99% but 20%, you will be happy that your innovation doesn't go to dust neither.  If it becomes 0.01%, you will be happy no one finger point at you for being a trouble maker.

Their method is not that wrong but obviously they fail to put the correct number of block reward in its calculation.  Ask them what the calculated cost is before and after one week the halving date then they will see the blind spot.
A necessary property for anything to be a money is its global consensus of the production cost which may follow as a result of scarcity by way of central limit theorem in math.  In the otherwise case of no agreement of the cost, the receiver of the money can too often argue against the giver of the money in their transaction using that media money.

Let's denote the energy number of digging 1.0 oz of gold by X.  I believe when you said about gold price you were talking about the exchange rate number "gold/USD", denoted by Y.  Note that even there is no human on the planet Earth, X is still there and Y is not.  Therefore it is not logical to get the X by any way of Y.  Just like light speed is irrelevant to any exchange rate of goods/fiat in a human society.  Whenever we discuss "value of gold" or "value of bitcoin" or "profit", we shall avoid the fiat concept and numbers in nominal fiat term.  Otherwise we can have 10x "value" or "profit" by simply increasing 10x the base volume of the fiat.  Instead, we shall discuss in real term.  By "real", it always means "physical".  The "If gold price increases more mines start to become profitable and people start to mine them" is indeed the energy arbitrage in working where two numbers are talking to each other: exchange rate of gold/joule and exchange rate of USD/joule (1 kwh energy is 0.15 USD, for example, therefore 1.0 USD is 24M joule).  Energy is the money of the universe and all scientists understand energy can not be created from thin air while many economics "experts" don't think so .  If homosapiens see some aliens heating 1000ml water from 20C to 100C by spending 1.0 alien coin, homosapiens would have an idea about how much the exchange rate the AlienCoin/USD is.

The aspiration level of the victim and the hacker are not the same.  While the victim has nothing to lose and is willing to have a budget of 7000BTC to do the reorg, the hacker who wants to enjoy his fruit may bribe the miner much less.
After all, it all comes down to "who has the most proof-of-energy work" in additional to the already work (it is more than 100 blocks away now) to define the reality (in a parallel universe, it may be the hacker is the good guy and CZ is the bad guy, who knows, but money is neutral anyway).  Say, the victim is starting the proposed plan after 30 blocks (5 hour), it is your move (imagine you are the hacker) then.  The game theory will play out.

The profit of the short position need not be 1-month maturity, it could be 4-year maturity as well, miner can always unwind the position to collect the insurance benefit long before the maturity if the price indeed goes down. The fun part will start when people see a significant difference of price of 1-month maturity contract and that of 4-year maturity contract.

The equilibrium average block fee has nothing to do with block size or transaction numbers.  It is qVT.

You need the same amount of energy --but not same amount of USD-- to enjoy a cup of tea many years before and after.  Therefore ideally, 1.0 dollar of a real money must represent constant energy all the time.  When you think real money like energy battery, many myths about money disappear.
By the energy arbitrage, the market will force a coin value to be the amount of proof-of-work whose definition is the energy amount for 1.0 unit.  For a battery, the proof-of-work amount is simply the energy amount of 1.0 battery.  For gold, the proof-of-work amount is the public understanding necessary energy of digging 1.0 oz of gold.
Once Joe realizes this, all the rests are simple math Joe can handle.  For example, with infinite base volume, the fee must tend to infinite and the proof-of-work amount must decrease eventually because P=KT/F and K is bounded.
Those proof-of-stack coins must have some proof-of-work behind the scene if they are not religion.

Ok.  Let's simulate it.  I play CZ and you play the hacker and I recognize the hack after 30 blocks.  I do the proposed plan, with some generous to signal to the community, I will pay the fee at 20 BTC.  My first transaction is my addr 7000 to my addr 6980, your move now.
@_date: 2019-05-08 19:13:22
You play the hacker so the sentence "I'm 375 BTC ahead of you" is weird.  In fact, my 20 BTC (or 14 BTC mentioned in this comments threads which is 12.5 + 1.5 block fee) is to compensate the miners for their loss in the old chain.
Since my preferred chain has block benefit 20 + 12.5 + irrelevant fee more attractive to self-interest of moners, if you (being the hacker) don't bribe the miners, people and all the miners will expect 30 blocks in my preferred chain are coming to take over your old chain.  People and I don't hear your move to bribe miners (don't know why, possible you are afraid to leak your identity) so my chain is likely to win currently in their minds and my chain is growing.  
For irrelevant transactions and users, their transactions are both recorded in your chain and my chain so there is no loss of trust for their coins provided by proof-of-work; whatever the mining power distributes between your chain and my chain, their coins have the same price and ticker BTC, neutral to our fight.  Your coin (let's name it BTC-whack: the coins from the coinbase of that 30 blocks and your hack transaction) may be less valuable than my coin (let's name it BTC-wohack) because all the self-interest mining powers want my chain to be true and devote their mining power to my chain while some little strange (for some unknown reason) mining powers bypass the self-interest and mine your chain.
The simulation started already 1 hour.  So now your chain is longer than my chain by 24 blocks and I have budget 6880.

There are many ways to decrease the coin value which is also joule number per coin.  Some are obvious and some are not.  For two examples, in addition to keeping base volume intact, people can: 
1. amend the block interval time to 5 minutes instead of 10 minutes.  
2. merge-mining with side chains with exchange rate pegged.
