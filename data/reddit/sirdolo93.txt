What does your age have to do with anything?
A smart investment, is a smart investment. No matter how old you are.
That's great, that is $750 profit. 
If I were you, I would sell of about .4 BTC. That should cover your initial payment of $250.
You should still have 1.2 Bitcoins left.

Well, I only know Mt.Gox that sells them. I have not made an account yet.
But I mean, if I was to, and I wanted to buy 50 bit coins. Would the price be $212 for each one?
Is there an average number of bit coins that I can buy before the price goes up?
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:45:07
About 4 years ago.
For real, its an all time high currently, and anyone will tell you to buy low, sell high. However, the price can double in 2 weeks, and you would be kicking your self right now.

So what your saying is, that it is a file. So I can easily just back up my file on a couple of USB sticks.
Have one in a safe at home, and one in a safe deposit box at a bank?

I don't see the relation. 
But even so. Gold has been dropping in value over the years... so you can't really make that claim either.
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:50:38
You can only buy 50 dollars worth with quickbt. Not worth it.

How do you even know we are even in the bubble. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:45:11
Real stupid. There is an FAQ. Regardless if people miss it its there. If there arrogant enough to ignore it and ask the same questions then they don't deserve and answer.
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:50:08
is this a plug for your website?
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:41:45
Meh, I did the exact same thing. 
I don't regret it, I mean, I'm up 300 dollars. From a 1,500 dollar investment. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:40:26
Honestly, I'd cash out right away if I ever made 1 million, but I probably wouldnt because the government would be all over you. Your money would probably get seized.
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:35:27
go big or go home!

I did it, and within 2 hours I got a call for a cruise...

I want to give out bits of bitcoins as xmas presents to family and relatives, although I can guarantee everyone that I plan to give them out to, will not actually see the potential or value of bitcoins, and cash out immediately
So it might be worth it to just send ~5 dollars worth of bitcoins, that way it probably won't be worth the time and effort to cash out immediately.

I have pay pass on my credit card and debit card. It takes me literally 3 seconds to scan my card, and I have paid for my coffee.

You would be stupid if you were panic selling all of your bitcoins right now. 
If you invested in bitcoins, just to see the price double in a month, and return back to fiat. Then you are doing it wrong.
I've already seen the potential of the bitcoin market. It seems to recover just fine from crashes. I'm holding my bitcoins for at least 2 years.

I am willing to compensate you $10 USD just give me a paypal address
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:31:48
trust me no one is going to donate bitcoins to you because you are a girl.
&lt; with a throwaway account.
@_date: 2013-11-16 05:08:34
I honestly was going to buy 10,000 dollars worth of bit coins about 2 weeks ago when the prices were like 200 dollars. 
I'm kicking my self right now. 
I'm thinking about buying 200 dollars worth of litecoins, and just forgetting about them and in a couple of years, I just hope it will blow up like bit coins.
@_date: 2013-11-21 05:43:23
Right now, I think bitcoins is just way to anonymous to use, and I don't think that fits well with the US Government, the NSA in particular. 
So, my thought is, the US Government, will make there own type of bitcoins, but re-design it, taking away the anonymous aspect behind it. So they can keep tabs on everyone's coins, and where they are going. I believe they will also build in some sort of tax for it as well. 
Thus, kills bitcoins, and USCoin's will prevail.
