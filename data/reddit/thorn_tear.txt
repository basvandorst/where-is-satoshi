Center your focus on your physical self first.  Relax tension (shoulders, jaw for example). Find good posture. Deep, slow, full breaths. 
Contemplate the things that were running in the background of your thoughts, you may find things that are subconsciously stressing you out for no reason other than the fact that you hadn't fully formulated a thought about it.
Then let it go.
Try to do this everyday.

Technically power of the purse and coining money are in the constitution as a congressional federal power. Technically congress is in control of allowing the fed reserve to operate:

 Hypo for you: I'll be doin more research, but could someone start up an LTN server system and make enough profit to support 1-2 families? If so what would entry cost look like?

I get what you're saying. Doesn't that count as a form of control by govt though? I could do with some antitrust actions busting up the lack of competitors for isp kingdoms. I don't think govt should be in charge of the internet.

Sorta, kinda. Paper is a single use address for the most part. It's "cold storage" since you don't have it kept within any working tech. Paper is low tech and lower ability to move the money (also easier to permanently lose. or have compromised by physical theft).
