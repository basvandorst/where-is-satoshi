I mean can I trade USD for BTC on Lightning, without ever touching Layer 1? Just wondering.
@_date: 2018-01-15 09:22:32
It's basically Ethereum on Bitcoin.
While Bitcoin is programmable it is very limited in what it can do (on purpose). Ethereum took the idea of "programmable money" a step further and created a much richer scripting language, one that is (apparently) Turing complete; a real computer.
RootStock is the same but uses Bitcoin instead of Ether, and aims to make an even "richer" language than Ethereum.
Distributed Apps (dApps) are the main feature of such a platform; the code doesn't reside on a central server, nor in "the cloud", but across the Bitcoin network itself, just like bitcoin. They can't be controlled, nor stopped.
Whether dApps are actually a useful direction is yet to be seen. The only dApp that is really running so far is CryptoKitties : \
Even though there is nothing of actual value made as a dApp yet, and I can't think of anything either, I still find the concept absolutely, honestly, mind-blowing (as a programmer); a distributed application.

~~One-line response~~
I'll show some respect for your post/the article. But I'm doubtful. Nonetheless I would be happy and interested to read your replies as I'm open to persuasion. See username.


Reach for remote. Stand up, adjust thermostat. Do we really need "an elegant solution" to save a couple of joules? Really? How fucking lazy are people that reaching for a remote control is not "an elegant solution"? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.
Importantly here a thermostat *maintains* temperature. You should not have to ever adjust it. This is new technology from the early 19th century and has been working just fine ever since, most people don't understand it. (source: refrigeration mechanic in past life)
Look, that was just a poor analogy used to frame the rest of the article for average Joe. I get it, but it was still a terrible analogy or two. : \
Then the article talks about there being no protocol that currently allows IOT devices to talk to each other. I think there could be very fair debate that there is room for an open protocol to be developed, perhaps even by the UN that has amongst other things developed protocols for B2B integration, or by a consortium of manufacturers, and that that protocol could completely undermine everything Walton has set out to do in one, swift, zero entry fee move. Honestly, it is very reasonable to expect that to happen.


Here's where I do not agree with the article, or at least not to the degree of excitement.


Goods need to be checked for breakage, that it's what you ordered, and so on. Can that be automated with an RFID? Nope.
And, these systems do exist. (source: work in supply chain software)


Which of these is not already available? Every department store, supermarket and so on already collects this information at Point Of Sale and shares, sells and one way or another disseminates and or uses this information to allow themselves and clients of this information to be more agile, innovative and so on. And no, Walton does not allow the suppliers to no longer rely on the POS as that is when the purchase occurs, and the only way sale information is collected.
The Hardware I can't comment on, except to say you don't need a crypto coin/ICO to do that. If the hardware is as good as they say, and I've no reason to doubt it, *buy shares* in the company.


Here's where I stopped (almost).
There is absolutely zero benefit to a *private* blockchain, in fact quite the opposite. In fact quite a lot the opposite. If you don't know why sell all your crypto now; you are gambling. [Short article that I haven't actually read but says is inspired by the same chapter I was searching for (I should read it first...)]( 
And there after in the article is the same issue I have with Ether. Ether on the Ethereum chain is a *resource*. It drives the processing of the dApps. Without it there is no oil to drive the dApps and the Ethereum chain is worthless. Ironically the more ETH is worth the less Ethereum is worth because it costs more to run the dApps that give it any value. Ethereum is all about the dApps, right? That is; the dApps are more efficient the less ETH is worth, and therefore the more the Ethereum chain is worth, and the dApps that reside on it and give it value. The Ethereum ecosystem is worth more the cheaper ETH is.
It is the same for Walton. As the price of the coin goes up the more expensive it is to use so the less it is worth.
While I'm not convinced Ethereum itself is a bad idea (I actually think it is mind-blowing) I am not convinced that it is better if the price of ETH rises, in fact quite the opposite. The dApps themselves are another story, but that ecosystem is still a wasteland populated only by cryptokittes.
So anyway, that was obviously very biased against Walton, perhaps dogmatically as I'm a Bitcoin maximalist, but hopefully I've somewhat clearly (see: mud) illustrated my thoughts. Please, please correct me where I am wrong or misunderstand, because I am always wrong.

Everything everyone else has said, plus:
Bitcoin (big B) is a protocol. Eventually it will be a protocol stack. The *Layer 2* applications are only now just sprouting. See: Lightning Network and RootStock.
In theory these applications can completely negate any and all alt coins. For example Lightning Network is essentially a DAG, like IOTA. RootStock is not only completely compatible with Ethereum it extends its programming language even further.
The rock-solid, never failed, battle tested Bitcoin is the bedrock all this runs on. Not other crypto comes even remotely close in this regard.
It'll be an interesting year for Bitcoin and crypto in general.

That's correct. Crypotokitties is an ETH thing, and RootStock is a BTC thing.
BTC does have smart contracts, however they do not have a rich programming language for them like ETH does. 
RootStock aims to change all this.

This is why you "don't invest more than you can lose", but let's be honest, we all do. "More than you can lose" is subjective, and as variable as the daily exchange rate.
I take it you've been buying since *the end of* 2017. If you look at the chart from exactly 2 years ago btc has been a fantastic investment, and literally the best *ever* over the last 10. **Time in the market, not timing the market**. This goes for *any* market.
It *is* a speculative investment, very, very much so. It *is* an experiment. It can fail, completely. It could also go on to be something nobody envisioned. Again, highly speculative.
If you have actually put in "as much as you can afford to lose", or a bit more like most of us have (, or, it has *turned into* more than we can afford to lose, you never hear about that story), then you have no choice but to try and enjoy the ride. At the very least it is an exciting, highly active investment, a true "ride", unlike something more staid like bonds.

Deflation will make loans more expensive. 
The entire modern world was created, starting around 1500, by both the scientific revolution and its new perception of "I am not the center and I don't know." You can see the change in perception written on maps at the time. Where before the world filled the entire map now there were huge swathes of empty space. Territory to explore.
These explorations were always accompanied by scientists and funded by governments (who print their own money) and/or large business loans. The entire face of the planet, and all its technological advances, the ones you are most familiar with and the shoulders for Bitcoin to stand on was funded and only made possible by loans, and fiat.
This is not going to stop. Nor should it.

That's a crazy amount of return, for the weaker currency. Your btc is still exactly the same.

If bitcoin remains *that* deflationary then it will *always* be useless as a currency.
You may find that once it reaches a saturation point deflation reduces to something manageable, like 3%.
So, what if you have a business opportunity that you need money for *now*? How else are you going to be able to enter into your profitable endeavour without a loan? If your estimated return is 50% and you can get a loan for 5% you'll take a loan. People will always need loans, even in a world of hyperbitcoinisation.
The ability to invest money, through what amount to essentially loans, into endeavours of all sorts is what has driven our technological progress. That can't stop.


BTC can be "owned" by more than one person at a time. Look, a lot of people *don't want* to be their own bank. They don't want the responsibility. That option *is always there* with bitcoin, but it is an option. How many people store all their btc on an exchange right now? I'd even wager that *most* people do.
With that in mind what if Coinbase offered a 5% interest for a 12 month term deposit? Some people would take up the offer. There's btc that can be lent. As for the remaining btc that coinbase is storing for all their customers so long as there isn't a run on it they *could* lend a portion of it out. Perhaps a majority of it. 
Or [duh duh duuuh] they can make their own token.

On top of that *look at the mempool*. Even mainstream media is laughing at how ridiculous the transaction costs are. It's everywhere.
This is absolutely no surprise at all. I'm an idiot for pausing when it was 0.1. Should have hedged my bets because the market can be irrational far more than you can stay solvent.
By the way [the btc:bch pair probably isn't as good/bad as people might think]( Zoom out. 0.14 is about the middle. Buy when it's below that. Sell when above. Accumulate more btc.

# Short answer:




Because critical thinking consumes energy, and is not pleasant. Whenever we learn new things we have to fire up parts of the brain that we don't use as often. 
For example: Learning to drive a car is a stressful and unpleasant time because your brain is fired up learning all the new skills, at once. After a few years you can drive without even thinking.
It's called *Fast Thinking and Slow Thinking*, slow thinking being when you are learning new skills, material, ideas etc., and fast thinking when you can do things automatically.
In short: People, all of us, don't like to think slow.
# Long answer:
There's a book on the subject [Thinking, Fast and Slow]( by Deniel Kahneman

That's exactly how it works, right? People invest into things because they *don't* understand it, and are bedazzled. See: ICOs.
*And then* they put more trust and respect into people the more they pay them. Humans are weird. For example you've paid $2 for a McDonald's burger and the girl serving you takes a few seconds longer than usual. A bit slow. People get angry at this girl (perhaps not you nor I). But then, if they're paying Dave $5,000 for his investment advice and he's 20 minutes late for a meeting *that's fine*! Humans : (

It does cost to transact it into and out of a channel, though. For current tx fees that'll be $10, each way. And it won't be getting any cheaper.  You'd want at least $1k's worth in a channel to make it viable @ 2% tx fees. This is not for the underbanked.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:45:51
To be absolutely, perfectly reasonably fair, the fees on the Bitcoin chain *are* currently *outrageous*. 
This is a *universally* accepted problem.
For example, fees over the last week have [averaged 200-400 satoshis/byte]( That's 500 - 1,000 bits per transaction (avg. size 250 bytes). 0.000500 - 0.001000 btc per transaction. Or, $US7 - $US10.
So, a $10 donation to Andreas last week would have cost about as much to send. And as much *again* for Andreas to spend. Let that sink in. (I can't imagine the weight of that address.)
That must go *some way* toward explaining the thought processes of the BCH argument. Nothing is black and white.

In Australia we can spend $10k on personal expenses, like tacos, without incurring a taxable event thingy. no need to report it or anything.

I like to ask potential investors, like my own family, a few basic questions about bitcoin to see if they have even a vague idea about what it is they are investing in.
1. Who invented bitcoin?
2. What is the name of the cryptographic hash function used to create Bitcoin addresses and also used in Bitcoin mining?
3. Who owns Bitcoin?
4. Where are you going to store your bitcoin (keys)?
Yes, 1. is a trick question. : )
Question 2 gives an idea of if you've done *any* research beyond the price.
You just *have to* get 3 correct.
4 is to segue into how to store bitcoin (keys) safely.
Some members of my family ask me "Will I be able to get my money back out? What if someone has run off with it? Hmmmmm....."  So it's a nope for them.

Mate, I'll grant that while away I was thinking about this and I've changed my mind. Somewhat. I totally agree with your quote above; it is useful in that context. I'll play devil's advocate for a bit though, tease out any holes  :b


That is very different to the my supply chain scenario where Oleg entered the incorrect data about a box of apples. If the blockchain actually *stores* the **digital item** then it is far more robust than a blockchain that *represents* a **physical item**.
That is the main qualm I have; blockchains that *represent* **physical items** rather than *store* **digital items**. They are completely different.
Wikipedia is a good example, although not blockchain per se; you can not only see the meta data pertaining to the changes, but the data itself and how it changed. It is all there.
Supply chain however does not lend itself to blockchain as the physical items are *never* there, just the meta data about them. You can *never* be sure that the meta data is correct.
Whereas something like, say, Bitcoin that stores the state and history of bitcoins is (probably) *always* correct as there are 100,000 fully validating nodes that you have to push invalid data past. *Everything* is always inside the system itself.

On the other hand salaries stay stagnant, or go down in real values with an inflationary currency. People can't afford housing, or to pay the guy to fix the doors, or the electrician to rewire the living room, and so on. Saving makes less and less difference, and is actually bad for the economy. Debt piles up.
It cuts both ways, and the above example if the one we are actually living in. It's not theoretical.
In a deflationary economy if someone can't afford to pay today they can "tomorrow". It's better than not being able to pay at all.
Obviously **neither** system works when they are experiencing hyperinflation or hyperdeflation. Both work when that rate is ~2%, or so it seems.
Bitcoin is, obviously, experiencing *massive* growth in its userbase, and is thus experiencing hyperdeflation, even though we are mining more of it. *It's currently and inflationary currency* 
So to say bitcoin doesn't work because deflation, while it is in its inflationary stage, is a bit odd.

Is r/cryptocurrency your big brother?
Sure, there are competitors to Bitcoin, but none of them have the security of the BTC chain. They may have faster transaction speeds, a richer layer on top for smart contract development, better anonymity, and whatever tweak they can come up with. Most, if not all, are forked from Bitcoin anyway. What they have in features they have, often, traded for security.
If Proof Of Work is the most secure method (it is), and Bitcoin has the most hash rate and node count, by far, (it does) then the answer for which is the most secure is elementary.
C'mon, just name your favourite alt-coin that has better security than Bitcoin. I'm still waiting for one so I can point out why it obviously doesn't have better security.

I don't think they are centralising Bitcoin at all. They'll have zero control over the protocol, the miners, the nodes.
It's not like they can say "Hey, let's make it 22 million."
What they are offering is *a custodial service*. And a good one at that.
Bitcoin *needs* a good custodial service, for people that don't have the skills or desire to be their own bank. And I'd warrant most people fall into that category.
Also falling into that category are the larger institutions, of course.
This doesn't change Bitcoin at all; it all happens at higher layers.
BAKKT doesn't need anyone's permission to do what they intend to do. And nobody can stop them. Sounds decentralised to me.

I'd just like to add that if bitcoin becomes a highly trusted, widely accepted money and object of value there isn't much between it and gold, and, from there, there isn't much preventing banks doing exactly what they did with gold; creating a IOU system complete with fractional reserves.
As, er, a retort to my own comment this might not happen the same as it happened with gold because bitcoin is so, so much easier to store and transfer and divide. It is a better *form* of money than gold (albeit it requires all the infrastructure of the internet to work).

All the examples I gave are forms of money. Money is **a medium** of exchange. That medium can be anything the two parties agree upon. "She paid for her accommodation in sexual favors". Throughout history it has been digital, paper, gold, salt, and pretty shells. 


That is not a minor detail. The contender for the first, decentralized, global currency (base) *absolutely has to be rock-solid secure and utterly dependable, always*. So far Bitcoin has run *flawlessly* for the better part of a decade.
Love it or hate it, think it completely useless, it genuinely is the most secure thing man has ever built.


It has more of the market share than all of the others combined. It moves far more value each day, it is more widely accepted. It is the only coin that is not an alt-coin, just like medicine that works is not called alternative medicine.
Now Bitcoin has a well proven, dependable, unstoppable Layer 1 you'll see more and more Layer 2, then 3, 4 and so on. Any other crypto promising Layer 2 solutions are, again, a clone of Bitcoin's Layer 2 solutions.
Alt-coins are driven by hype. They have to pull magic tricks to get noticed. And in the end they are just that; magic tricks. 
Bitcoin has no "partnership announcements", who would announce them? Not even [this]( is a "partnership announcement". Bitcoin is a experimental, extremely solid protocol that was built to be extensible but not modifiable from the outset. The Bitcoin protocol will soon reach a point it won't change anymore. Then Layer 2,3 etc.

A government created cryptocurrency is still, well, fiat. It's a different *technical* implementation of the current government created digital currencies, but otherwise exactly the same; it can be created at a whim, centralised, tracked, etc. etc. etc.

I completely disagree.
I booked a hotel overseas last week. I got a PayPal link for the amount in a foreign currency.
It was a **single-click** to confirm and then convert the currency at the time I eventually got around to paying it, days later, and then pay in cash from my bank account.
Bitcoin stumbles here because there would be *three* exchange rates to consider, and they are not relevant to when the invoice is created, but rather when it is *paid*. i.e. you can't just create a QR.
Unless there's a service I am unfamiliar with that does the same.
Keeping the transaction completely within the btc universe does not work yet as the currency is still far, far too small and vulnerable to changes in its value between when i made the request to when I paid it, days later.
Of course, if btc were far, far more widely accepted it would be more stable and the entire process *could* take place entirely in btc. But that is not the case today.

It’d be nice if you included that S = Stock, and F = Flow. 
The theory is that rare things are valuable (so long as they can do *something*). 
If the Stock of the thing can be replenished by the Flow of finding/printing/producing it in 1 year, then it is said to have an S/F ratio of 1. If it would take 20 years to replenish (double) the Stock, then it would have an S/F ratio of 20. 
E.g. Bitcoin’s inflation rate is currently at around 4% with 12.5 being created every 10 minutes, so it has an S/F of 25. It would take 25 years at 12.5 every 10 minutes to double the existing bitcoin in existence. 
So, with all that in mind, and it’s fairly simple, I still have no idea what the graph represents.

I'll have a go, for argument's sake.
Property, such as a house, is the most expensive purchase people make in their lives, typically/classically.
If the value of money is appreciating at a greater rate than property, then delaying consumption only gets easier to maintain. After all one can rent in the meantime.
This would have a very detrimental effect on the building industry, and that industry supports a huge chunk of the economy, typically/classically.
So, new homes wouldn't be getting built because there would be fewer buyers. However, being that there are still the same number of people, the rental market would see an increase in demand, perhaps fueling an increase in the value of property from that angle. There might be more high density homes built as a result; apartments.
....aaaaand I don't really know where I'm going with this, but it seems interesting.
There would be a large influx of low(er)-quality rental properties built to cater to the new demand. That might be an interesting sociological change. Can anyone take it from here?

Eth and btc are trading pairs. People are able to trade them directly from one to the other.

You're not getting it. I'll try to explain it a little better.


How much was a house in 1970, and how much now? Is it 20x as much? Have wages grown at the same rate as the cost of housing?
Some other essentials will vary, I think bread might even be cheaper, but most other essentials are now more **relatively**; wages have increased 20x, and essentials have increases *more* than 20x.
i.e. essentials have inflated *\*more\** than wages. I doubt any price has stayed the same to anything else, relatively.
The cost of housing alone blows away any wage inflation, and is the biggest chunk by far of essential costs..

Supply and demand doesn't really work nice and linear like that. It becomes *very* complicated.
Say there are 10 people in a hostel, and 10 beds. There's no pressure. Now say 2 more people turn up, they need a bed. The perceived value of those beds is going to increase. What if 3 more people turn up.

The US manipulates its own economy, first, by adjusting the interest rates. The economy then affects the currency (its exchange rates). The US has no absolute control over the exchange rates, they are free floating.
China just changes the exchange rates. They are fixed.
This means China can print and use as much Yuan as they like, an infinite supply of money (and power), *without affecting the exchange rate.*

I'm not talking about the number of transactions as much as I am the total cost/mining reward of transactions, and that a small transaction fee is actually a bug, not a feature.
PoW secures the blockchain with energy. This has to be paid for. Right now it is paid for by block rewards, practically entirely. In the future as block rewards get halved into nothing PoW will have to be paid for by transaction costs.
Right now PoW is maintained by rewards of 75btc per hour. About 650,000btc per year is given to miners as a reward for securing the network. An inflation rate/tax/theft of about 4%.
Right now the transaction fees are nowhere near this.
Long term transaction fees have to increase ...*a lot*, to cover the cost of securing the blockchain.
Or, of course, the value of bitcoin has to increase a lot. But just because it has to to maintain the cost of PoW doesn't mean it will; that's not a good reason.

This is in the context of OP advertising their "wealth", and a $5 or wrench attack. 
In the worst scenario, a kidnap, it doesn't matter that you have USD, property, art, whatever, if the kidnapper wants bitcoin. A lot of ransoms these days are, of course, in bitcoin.
Your USD gets exchanged for bitcoin, which is irreversible once the attacker has it. Your USD is gone.
In this, albeit extreme but common in some parts of the world, scenario (my favourite interview with kidnappers in Brasil goes something like "How many people have you kidnapped?" pause. pause. pause. "What, this week?") it is all a moot point; don't flaunt your wealth.

It grew to where it is today by well over 100,000 users using it as a speculative investment, mostly, and/or a highly volatile "store of value". 99% of people that hold bitcoin have never bought anything with bitcoin. Perhaps 1% have bought a sticker or something.
This is not a bad thing. Merchants will not accept it, properly, not just converting it to fiat, until it is a stable store of value. That won't happen until enough people use it like gold 2.0.

There are people who genuinely argue that "software is 5% of bitcoin!". Argue that most of it is about promotion and money and exchanges and that side of things.
That side of things I totally agree *is* very, very important. No argument. But it is *nothing* without software. Zero. Bitcoin is, at its base level, software. (One might argue its a libertarian movement beneath that)
Bitcoin is certainly more than 5% software. Software is its most critical part.

[Have a read of what Trezor went through to support the bitcoin cash fork.](


For the layman: You can easily compare two sets of code using a variety of tools. [Random example]( They will beautifully highlight the differences between the two. In this scenario Trezor wanted to see the minor differences (in total) between the two sets of code. But, because BitcoinABC (cash) thought it a good idea to change *the style* of the code, just how it looks, the format, it made every line different. It was now almost impossible to find the minor differences.
Given the scenario, a multibillion dollar product, changing style is, inarguably, retarded. I hate to use that word in general but it is actually the correct word to use in this case. From the Latin 'tard'; slow. The developers on that chain are a bit slow to learn.

If you live outside the U.S. its perceived value is quite different. I can't buy coffee with it, for example. If I am in a location experiencing massive inflation it is worth more than its face value, and is hoarded.

2.5% whether you swipe or not. It’s inflation. 
Right now Bitcoin has a 4.25% “fee”. Without it the network will not run. 
So what does happen in 4 years, or 10 years, actually? The miners that protect the entire system have to be compensated *somehow*. 
It’s going to be much higher transaction fees, or the code gets changed to allow for more inflation.   Or quite simply Bitcoin dies.

Money *itself*, all money ever invented and used, is/was a bubble. 
Take gold for example. The Incas were just rolling in the stuff. It was practically plastic to them. They used it to make jewellery and ...not much else as it is very soft. They didn't value it *anywhere near* as much as Europeans did at the time. 
Gold is, essentially, a useless rock. You can't eat it. You are very limited in what you can do with it.
Until it was used as money in Europe &amp; Asia.
And this kind of "just happened". Nobody decreed it. No empires or kingdoms can create gold. It was just decided upon as something fungible, rare, divisible and transportable enough that it could be used as *a form* of money. 
Before and during that time spices were also commonly used as money. And shells.
When the Spaniards arrived in South America the amount of gold dripping everywhere blew their minds. The Incas *could not understand* what the Europeans saw in gold. When the Incas asked why they valued it so much the Europeans' reply was something not unlike "It is an ailment for a disease of our hearts we all have."
The point is all *forms* of money are a bubble. They start out worth nothing, gold was once worthless as were shells, and then as they are used as currency, a store of value, and if popular enough a unit of measure, they increase in value rapidly. People want it because other people want it.
Most *forms* of money have been around so long nobody alive remembers the initial inflation of the bubble, so it is never even considered a bubble. It's just "money". It just has value because it always has.
There's more than just the technical angle to bitcoin.

**We all leverage.**
*If you have any debt* and own bitcoin you are leveraging. Whatever interest rate you are paying on that debt is your leverage.
Say you owe $1,000 at 5% and you decide to buy $1,000 worth of bitcoin instead of paying off that debt. You are leveraged 20:1.
The interest on that debt is about $1/week. If you bought bitcoin when it was trading at $5k, October 12, and sold now while it's trading at around double that, then you made a return of $1,000.
But it really only cost you $1/week to have that $1,000; $7.
You turned $7 into $1,000 in 7 weeks. 142.85x. 14,000% in seven weeks.
I know, I know, I knowiknowiknow....
But that's *one* way of looking at it. And it's correct. You might have another correct way of looking at it, and we'll both be more correct than each other. : D

If someone wanted to attack the network that is what is would cost. The maths is simple: 12.5 * 6 * 24. 
The cost will be half that in a few months. 
It’s a know problem, openly discussed. It’s why the transaction costs have to stay high going forward (or create a chain that can have more transactions, that nobody is using).
If a state wanted to attack Bitcoin it would be like swatting a fly. Negligible cost. States don’t have reason to attack it, yet. But the more successful it becomes the more of a target it becomes.

Sure, but in your response you've mentioned *government*, *borders* and *bank*. All of these are figments of the collective human psyche. They don't really exist, except in our minds. Ditto money.
Government: Take a photo of it. Wait 10 years and take another. It's completely different, and yet the same. The only way a government can cease to exist is if its *country* ceases to exist, and a country is just another entity that only exists in the collective human psyche. Ask a duck that flies north for winter (southern hemisphere perspective) how many countries it flies over.
Borders: See *country*.
Bank: Not unlike *government*. You could replace every single aspect of a bank, its staff, its buildings, its logos, its customers, and it would still be the same bank. 
I'm sure we both agree about bitcoin, no argument, but it's a subtle point that most people do not even begin to understand; money isn't actually real. So bitcoin is just as real as any other money.

Sure, but the reality is a little less idealistic and utopian than that. 
Every 10 minutes or so a block is produced. As a reward for securing each and every block 12.5 bitcoin is created, out of thin air.

The cost of securing it is  approximately (12.5 * 6 * 24 * $7,500) $13m per day. 
A single 51% attack, that would wreck a day’s transactions and faith in the system along with it,  would cost a brand new actor $13m, half that for current miners.

It doesn't change the fact that the cost of attacking the network is far, far lower than most imagine it to be. That is can be shown indisputably on the back of a napkin, that it is that simple, that one-dimensional, only further reinforces its reality. It's not complicated
12.5 * 6 * 24. And soon it will be half of that.
That's 24 hour's worth or re-org. A shallow and wide attack would only require a few hours; 12.5 * 6 * 3. And soon it will be half that.
The only reason nobody has attacked it is because they don't have incentive to. Up to this point who has had incentive?
If at some point the mining reward becomes too small [cough cough] it would be worth it for miners to attack it themselves. Short it and cut their losses.
(BTW this is why some were celebrating the $50 tx fees in late 2017; it showed that transaction fees could support the cost of securing the network)
If at some point it becomes fantastically successful and entwined with real financial markets, say pension funds, then it really will be worth attacking it. Imagine a hostile foreign nation wanting to cripple another nation financially. (See: no EFT, for good reason)
In this case Bitcoin's success would only serve make it a very real (and as shown above very easy) target. What's good for Bitcoin is bad for Bitcoin; it is anti-fragile, but it is not anti-anti-fragile.

The cost of mining is the mining reward. Or less. Else miners would not mine. 
The cost of the attack is the cost of mining for the number of blocks you want to reorganise. I used 1 day. I reckon just demonstrating it could be done for 3 hours of blocks is enough. Even satoshi said to only wait 6 blocks. 
Now, you could recoup that expense by selling the reward, but you’d have to wait 100 blocks to do that, by which they’ve lost a lot of value from your attack. 
So consider it all lost. 12.5 * 6 * 23. And soon it will be half. 
The attack is a reorganisation of the chain. A heavier chain that is not broadcast for a day. I take it you understand this part?
It could be done by a collusion of miners, or, say, the CCP confiscating all mining equipment in China. There are other examples.

Then there’s Lightning.
My point being with Bitcoin’s *current* user base and use case the shitty tx speed and cost on main net is fine. Perfectly fine. 
The speed and cost is fine for anything more than, say, the equivalent of $20, that you aren’t standing in a line for. 
Going forward that is not the case. A good second layer solution would obviously be required to transform it from a (highly speculative right now) base money and/or store of wealth into a day-to-day consumer technology. 
And I’m not completely convinced Lighting is going to be the best 2nd layer solution. I’m super curious to see what Baakt, Microsoft and co. have in mind.

There is no solution in place, not on the base layer.
Layer 2 has the experimental Lightning Network. It will be interesting to see if it is ready in time, and works as planned, or envisioned, or hoped.
And there is also whatever BAKKT are doing, which is if I understand correctly an uber ledger. That might even give Lightning a run for its money. I mean, Microsoft, who are in bed with them, has wanted digital currency since Windows 95. (and it's bitcoin, not private coin!)

It is obvious the cost of the attack, let's say 12.5 * 6 * 3hrs * $7,500, is a little beyond the average individual's capability.


The reality is the cost of deep reorganisation of the blockchain, a day's worth, is 12.5 * 6 * 24. Soon to be half that. 
A day's worth of reorg would erode trust in the supposedly trustless system. Do you not see the irony?

It's an interesting point that admittedly I hadn't considered before. Inflation is usually associated with an increase in the amount of money in circulation, not its buying power. Which is why it is said that bitcoin's inflation is known.
But yes, if buying power is increasing then inflation is negative.

Simply to illustrate.


typos; ignore.


If you bought at 15K and sold at 25K, you made 10K.
If you bought at 15K, sold at 5K, bought at 5K, and sold at 25K, you made -10K + 20K = 10K.
It's the same. Of course.
I can't see how you figure you'll be taxed less on the gains. The gains will be exactly the same no matter how you chop them up. The only thing you risk is paying more tax because of short-term gains.
edit: ohhhh:

So, let's say you bought at 15k, sold and bought again at 5k. And let's say in 12 months it is at 20k. ^(for entertainment)
If you sell, and buy again, now you can carry your 10k loss forward, against your 15k profit. A 5k profit.
Or you can hold, and sell at 20k. A 5k profit.

Actually thinking about it some more I don't think a spreadsheet to convert to local currency for every transaction at time of transaction is required at all.
If you received 1btc over a financial year then you are taxed at whatever that is worth *at the end of the financial year*. So you only need the exchange rate as of midnight at the end of the financial year. **It's really that simple.**
(because you'll need to pay tax on any profit made from rate of exchange too, might as well just add it all up at the end in one, simple calculation)

Also, miners need to sell btc to pay for bills. 
The lower the price the more they have to sell, the more there is for sale, the lower the price, the more they have to sell... I think that's what we are seeing now. 
Conversely when the price is rising they have to sell less and less, less for sale, prices goes up, etc. etc.
i.e. bitcoin does not have the level of adoption to mitigate the effect of mining costs. The market is overly affected by them, reacts accordingly, and remains in a feedback loop of volatility.

It's a very good attack. It uses Bitcoin against itself. It's not exploiting a weakness, rather a strength.
It would be relatively easy to create transactions that when their data is combined constitute an image, and the software to view, browse and catalogue that data.

This is how most wallets work. They are a collection of addresses.
Your metaphors are wrong. Bitcoin is strange. : )
An address is not an account, it is the equivalent to ...erm, a note in your wallet. Your wallet has many (many, many) of these. Each address/note has a denomination equivalent to the sum of unspent transactions that were sent to it; inputs.
Hmm... I'll try harder.
You are the bank. Your HD Wallet is really a bank. Each address is an account. You control all the accounts in the bank.

Isn't it as simple as accepting bitcoin at the point of sale? "Would you like to pay by cash, card, or bitcoin?" Type in the amount in dollars and your POS device (a phone, iPad, whatever running any bitcoin wallet) converts it to btc and generates the code. 
You'll have to accept "zero confirmation" transactions but the likelihood of anyone running a relatively complicated scam on you for a few bucks worth is very, very, very remote.
To set yourself up with a bitcoin business account:
1. Setup a wallet with its own pass phrase, specifically for your business.
Seriously, that's it. You have to keep that pass phrase safe and so on, but that's it in a nutshell.
As for tax I can't completely answer your question. However, I can't imagine it would be difficult. Your wallet will be able to export all transactions and I imagine there's software out there that can then give you the conversion rate for each transaction, in a spreadsheet, sum() at the bottom.
In fact I'll see if I can't make a spreadsheet for exactly that right now...
edit:  Aaaaand everyone's home from school and so-on so the timing is awful : )
But, all you'd need for the volume you are talking is *a simple spreadsheet* with your bitcoin ledger data for sends, receives and datetime on one sheet. A sheet with exchange rates for the financial year on another, the [export button here]( And a VLOOKUP that matches the datetime of the receive with the exchange rate at end of that hour. 
Basically, a high school student could mock you this up in less than an hour. I was already half way there but "are you coming for dinner???" : D
edit: I've sent you a PM with an example spreadsheet. As you can see pretty easy peasy; you just need to convert to $ at time of transaction. You could get a high school student to take it further but that's the crux of it.

Absolutely yes; decentralised means that no single entity controls it. It's kinda "free", "of itself", can't be controlled.
But if the people overthrow the government then they simply become the government themselves. Right? Happens all the time when rebels rise up against the powers that be, shouting slogans and inciting passions, end up winning, and realise with some horror that they are now the ones responsible for organising efficient bus timetables. Not quite the glamour and martyrdom they were hoping for.
I was originally saying that most if not all human advancement came through a collective, somewhat centralised organisation, such as Roman roads. However if we look at (especially) the 20th century we can see a lot of the advancements came via the decentralised structures of capitalism.
[pant pant] but what I was also trying to illustrate was that *even those* structures are somewhat centralised; they are often private companies etc. That is: advancements do not happen in isolation, they need some sort of a pyramid structure for the advancements being discovered at the top. "Standing on the shoulders of giants".

You could do the same with bitcoin. Hell, you could do the same with snowmobiles.
Say you had 10 snowmobiles. You don't use them all the time, all at once, so you put a few in storage with SnowMoRentals. 
SnowMoRentals will store your 10 snowmobiles, and for allowing them to rent them out they'll give you another one at the end of the year.
Alice, Bob and Charlie rent a snowmobile each. Now they have 3 snowmobiles between them, and you have 10 = 13 snowmobiles.
There are, of course, only 10 snowmobiles, but they are shared or split *over time*. They are "owned" by more than one person at once. Nobody expects, and it is extremely unlikely, that more than 10 will be used at the same time.
This is more an example of a term deposit, but you can keep going; Alice and Bob could store their snowmobiles too.

The fee in this $9 transaction was 6c (of btc). 0.6%.
That's comparable, if not better, than points already, because yeah you get points but they aren't really worth what they sell them to you as; those products are overpriced. It varies from place to place but people often pay 1.5% and get half that in the value of their points.
I'd actually say it was the same as paying with credit card, and of course the fees are the same no matter the price, so less expensive items will work out worse, more expensive items will work out better.
(...and then there's Lightning)
Let's not forget that there were no banks used in this transaction. It was directly from person A to person B. That is super efficient. Take a look at [the source code for Bitcoin]( That's it. All of it. 
Compare that (if we could) to the layers and layers *and layers* and disparate pieces and chunks of code, used between multiple systems and systems of systems, some of it dating from the 60s, that is required to send funds via Visa et al. *It is unimagineable*.

There's isn't much of an intersection between receiving money and being offline.

Right now most bitcoin holders have their funds on an exchange. Hello centralized crypto banks!
The thing is we don't have to keep our btc on an exchange, nor do we have to use an uber hub.
For one-time, ad hoc payments yes, we'll probably use the convenience of an uber hub.
For regular payments, or payments to regular merchants like Amazon et al, we can open our own channel and fill it. And then refill it. This is likely 90%+ of payments. In a bitcoin maximalist world these are payments like rent, internet, electricity, local grocery store, local coffee shop, local weed shop, local brothel etc. etc.

In laymans' terms:
A block of bitcoin transactions is 'mined' every 10 minutes, on average. The block is considered 'mined' when the results of an algorithm ends in a certain number of zeroes.
Let's say 'the block' is something like "1btc from alice to bob, 0.5btc from charlie to dave". If we used a really simple "algorithm" of say "turn each letter into its position in the alphabet" we'd get something like "252203...".
Now, what miners are required to do to mine a block is take the results of that algorithm, add a number to it, and have it end in a lot of zeroes.
For example if the block using the really simple algorithm from above came out as "33333", and we had to find a number that when added to it ended in 3 zerores, that number we'd need to find would be (among others) 777.
The "nonce", the number that needs to be used by the algorithm to get a result ending in a certain number of zeroes, in our very simple example, is 777.
Now, the actual algorithm is far, far harder than that. In fact it is so difficult that there is no known solution. The only way to find the nonce *is to guess it.*
The miners are taking the block, running through a list of numbers, applying them against the algorithm and hoping it to end in a lot of zeroes.
Again, there is no known solution, so they are just guessing. Very fast. The hardware is specifically designed to *only* take the block, a number, and apply it against the algorithm.
At present the sum total of all mining is guessing at \~85,000,000,000,000,000,000 guesses per second. (I *think* that's the equivalent of everyone on earth guessing at 1 trillion per second each)

But how do you get amounts of this size onto the 2nd layer?
Using lightning it requires a transaction on layer 1. And if $USD80 is a waste of a precious resource then we'd have to move much more than that onto layer 2 to make it worthwhile. Meaning it is out of reach of all these 3rd world people Bitcoin is supposed to save.
Bitcoin, for now, is gold 2.0. It wasn't designed that way, but many, many, many inventions and assets are not used as per there original intention. See: gold.

Technology always looks incredibly promising. When I was a kid I was sure I'd be working on the moon by now, and given the respective technological curve, from first powered flight to the fucking moon in about 50 years, it seemed *likely*.
What I'm saying is AI will not affect us how anyone is theorising it will. Not a chance.
However, AI will affect us in ways we can't imagine. Major influences on society always seem to come out of nowhere.
So, I guess what I'm saying, rather pointlessly, is that nobody has any idea what the future will bring, at all.

I find myself spending more as my btc appreciates.
Sometimes to see something really clearly you have to exaggerate it. Not unlike a microscope or a telescope.
Imagine btc appreciating at something crazy, like 10% a day, against a good like bananas. One day I can buy 10 bananas, the next 11. Let's exaggerate to 100% a day. It's now appreciating so fast *I can't spend it fast enough*. I can't consume that many bananas. There'd have to be a point where you just say "it's more than enough."
It's an intentionally silly thought experiment, but it illustrates that just perhaps an appreciating asset might have people spending *more*.

Man, I had so many issues in testnet just trying to buy something at starblocks as the node count grew, or so it seemed. When it first launched it worked every time, but after a few weeks, and with more and more nodes I persistently received "unable to find path" errors. After a few weeks I gave up. (yes I had open, funded channels etc.)
I've only been casually playing with lightning on testnet so if anyone could explain that'd be appreciated, I'm genuinely curious as to what was going on and how others' experiences with lightning are. Was it just me?

Not many people accept my $NZ either. Outside New Zealand it is even more useless than bitcoin.


It is too volatile because it is too small a currency. Not enough people are using it to make it stable. If more people use it it will become more stable, meaning more people will use it. Or the opposite could happen. While I agree with this point I disagree at the same time because feedback loop.


See previous point. "Nobody uses it because it is too volatile because nobody uses it." Well yes, but no, sort of.


The question is "is it a better *form* of money, this programmable money?" Even if is the best form of money possible it can't be magically stable in value overnight because, as you've pointed out, that takes a lot of people using it, and that takes time, and something to really bootstrap its use; a killer app that *requires bitcoin*.

As an example you could send money to this address, right now, practically instantly. No bank account required at all.
That's all you need to send someone (not me actually) money. Even internationally.
Sender &gt; money &gt; receiver.
It's a really elegant solution that's rebuilt electronic money from scratch. Got it right the first time.
The current system is something like: Sender &gt; bank &gt; money &gt; payment system 1 &gt; payment system 2 &gt; international payment system 1 &gt; ... &gt; sticky tape &gt; bank &gt; receiver. And all that takes hundreds of thousands of people and unfathomable layers of architecture and soft security.
In its home territory, the internet, bitcoin is supreme. If there was a money for the internet this is it. The question might be will we use the internet more in the future?
edit: but yeah; it's volatility restricts its uptake creates volatility. It's a speculative investment in its future right now. (that said it's very handy for splitting bills at restaurants and things like that. I've used it quite a bit)

30 retailers. wow.
The card I have allows me to spend bitcoin at **any** retailer in Australia. All of them. I can buy *anything* in Australia, *anywhere* with bitcoin, via the [EFTPOS network]( which is the only network. I do not know of a retailer that is not on it. Even sausage sizzles use it. I haven't used cash in about 5 years. 
In case i'm not clear: *I can literally buy anything with bitcoin*.
However, I don't use the card because, just like in France, it is converting btc to fiat at the point of sale. The retailers are accepting fiat, not bitcoin.


You can convert your fiat to bitcoin, and then convert it back to fiat to buy something. But why? All you are going to do is pay exchange fees. Twice.

Comment above is deleted, but I assume you mean bitcoin will make loans obsolete.
If so, that is a ridiculous statement.
Loans are essentially an investment. The creditor is investing in the debtors ability to generate money, one way or another, in the future.
Loans are an *extremely* useful tool that have financed ...well, basically everything. Every major construction or expedition or piece of research. Civilization itself is built on credit.
Even on a personal level there are certain items that generally go *up* in value, such as real estate, and are also rather expensive. Similar to obtaining bitcoin *now*, while it's cheap(er), it is also prudent to buy a house *now*, while it is cheap(er) than it will be in 20 year's time (typically).
So, how are people going to buy a home if there are no loans? What would remove the need for a loan for a house?

Well, you can discount history, and you can discount *some* history. You'll of course get greatly varying results.
So, do you include all history, or some history? Is some history more pertinent than other history? Can you even leave out some history *within* a range? Of course you could *weight* those factors, perhaps even as a variable over time. 
What factors decide whether to do that, or not? They could be factors like a hack, sentimental factors like an arbitrary number being reached, technical advances, legal precedents, wars, competition... and on and on and on. A bottomless list of variables all affecting each other and affected by another endless list of variables.
Without doing any of that you're just drawing a straight fucking line through the middle.

It's a belief system, the most powerful thing known to man.
It is a store of value. It is this because *other* people say it is. If enough people value it as a store of value then it is. That is all it needs.
Property and gold are better known stores of value. The former is not good for society when used as a commodity, it causes housing bubbles. The latter is not good for society as it wrecks the [environment]( and artificially inflates the value of gold that it can't be used for as much as it could otherwise be.
Money itself is a belief system. It is not real. $1 dollar doesn't weigh anything.
I wouldn't say Bitcoin is money though. Neither is it a commodity. It's just Bitcoin, something else entirely new.
I think that bitcoin *may* turn out to be an excellent store of value. In the meantime there will *always* be some nerds that value it.
