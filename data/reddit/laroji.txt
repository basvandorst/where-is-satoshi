Have you even read his statement? I'm not gonna bother linking that, go look it up yourself.

Yeah I think for me, trying to visualize a super hypothetical future which is probably at least a decade away using the same hardware as today is not only unrealistic but it also makes no sense. 
Imagine a company like IBM, Microsoft, Facebook or Google using the same exact hardware for a decade with the same kind of growth as Bitcoin is having. It makes no sense. We've seen ASIC miners get more sophisticated and more powerful over the years, so why not nodes?
