Cool picture! How many connections did you have and how many supported xtreme thinblocks? 
@_date: 2016-02-26 21:28:35
Thanks for your explanations. Its always nice read a different point of view.
Is it fishy that i discuss something here with you and on a different sub with other people? Maybe im too new to reddit to understand the culture here
@_date: 2016-02-26 20:55:13
Yes.

Since a big part of the debate is about decentralization and this help running a node on slow home connections. Hell Yeah!

Ya spikes are what causes lag when online gaming and running p2p software simultanisly

It means a newly mined block can be sent through the network 50x faster. And it reduces upload/download volume for nodes

The best compression rate i had was around 52. That means a thinblock is 52 times smaller than the actual block, which is huge when you send that block to all your peers

It lets your node relay a new block in less than 1.5 seconds, which helps a lot keeping the network sync and reduce orphaned blocks

Alts with more cumulative double-SHA256 PoW than the main Bitcoin  chain? Wtf are you smoking sir?
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:57:59
Well think about what it would take the BCH chain to overcome the BTC chain in cumulative PoW. Price of BCH would need to rise constantly over months (many difficulty adjustent periods), making BCH more profitable to mine. Difficulty would need to rise strongly every 2016 blocks.
This is no today this, tomorow that case.

Maybe BClassic or BCore? Ticker would be BCL and BCR.

Mining hardware decentralization. If Bitcoin becomes mainstream after the scaling debate i want to see companies like AMD, Nvidia or Qualcomm build Bitcoin Miners. (no offense to Bitfury or Bitmain)

It makes the blockchain more decentralized, which is important for the longterm health of the bitcoin network.
