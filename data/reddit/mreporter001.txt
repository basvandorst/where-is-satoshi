An excerpt:  
**I noticed that your Twitter DMs are open. What kind of messages are you getting from the crypto community?**  
A range of messages, some blaming me for having lost all their money in crypto and some offering to give me their perspectives on what’s going on in crypto. I do prefer if people reach out directly to my office. It’s just an easier way to be able to communicate with people. I’m not particularly quick at responding to the DMs.
**But they are open, so I guess you do want to hear some of what people have to say.**  
I’m always eager to hear from people, and I think people in this space always have interesting thoughts. I like hearing from people who don’t normally interact with the SEC because part of the message I want to get across to people is that if we’re going to put a regulatory framework in place that is going to affect what you can and can’t do, I really want to know what you think.
**How does it feel when someone blames you for losing their life savings?**  
My heart goes out to people who have lost a lot of money, whether it’s in this kind of investment scam or any kind of investment scam, and that’s why I really do encourage people, whether it’s crypto or whether it’s any other kind of investment, to ask lots of questions. And if you can’t get answers and if you don’t understand how something works, my suggestion is that you shouldn’t invest. I’m always sad when people get hurt, but I do think that it can be a good lesson for them and the rest of us that you need to to be skeptical and be careful.

**Were any of the stars of the movie into crypto? Like, is Kurt Russell a bitcoin guy?**  
He’s not. He grows wine grapes, [he makes wine]( And \[his character, a potato farmer\] represented the other world. The future is cryptocurrency, and the past is sort of “look the guy in the eye,” you’re growing stuff in the earth, and you rely on the stuff you can see and you can feel. Kurt was sort of perfect for that.

He's still working on it, so it could take a while.
