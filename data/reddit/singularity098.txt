I'm surprised anyone would still be willing to remain a customer after getting burned so hard.  This isn't even the worst possible outcome, but holy hell...

Expressing Ethereum's value in BTC has relevance for trading but I feel like a comparison to what you can actually get in real world terms for the coin is what makes the most sense.  
You can get a brand new iPhone for an ether now, whereas a few months ago you'd only be able to get a low end off brand Android or something. (I don't even like iPhones, I'm just saying)
It's at an all time high.  1 eth = 0.15 BTC was not the all time high compared to now.

I almost can't believe that Trump supporters still exist at this point in the presidency.  Have you not been paying any attention whatsoever to the revolving door, flaming train wreck that has been the Trump administration?

@_date: 2018-01-23 22:21:44
Yeah that's a fair question.  I believe that it probably dropped from the mempool but when I'd launch the Mycelium app or at least opened the transaction to look at it, it might have resubmitted it automatically.
I'm just glad it's finally confirmed.

I recall hearing Andreas on a podcast just like a week or two before that donation frenzy and he was talking about how poor he is and his he lives an absolute minimal lifestyle and even prefers that lifestyle.
I'm sure that he'll treat himself to a few things and now he has total financial security.... but honestly I doubt that he will change his lifestyle much, and he was not letting his situation get him down before.

Honestly though if you just buy a high end GPU and embrace the crypto thing and mine Ether or Monero with it or something like that, you can make your money back in 3-6 months which is even better than things were 10 years ago.... right?

That's why I said most.  Ethereum is an exception.

Pretty much agreed but the idea of doing your everyday transactions in Bitcoin becomes incredibly complicated by the fact that the IRS and the tax authorities of many other countries treat it as an asset rather than currency.

Great info.
Usually I don't really care much about merchant adoption of bitcoin because it doesn't really "enable" anything that wasn't already possible... but in the case of digital downloads this could in fact increase Steam's "reach" to corners of the Earth which they simply couldn't do business in before due to no available payment options.
Very cool stuff.  I've already purchased a Steam game with BTC and it worked great.  Good job, Steam!

I appreciate the style of your insults.
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:13:14


You're actually wrong though.  The reason is not because "they can and in their mind it's worth it".... it's because most wallets do not allow custom fees, and most users do not know how to apply an appropriate fee even if given the option.  I can assure you that people will pay the lowest fee possible if they understand how this works and have the option.
It is worth asking these questions because the answers might lead us to actually improving the system.  I'm not sure why you have a grumpy attitude towards the discussion.

Please provide a source.  I do not believe this is true, though I'd be happy if it is.
The funds would be timelocked into the lightning channel, and once that period of time is up the funds would be settled back onto the main chain, at which point you have to fund a channel all over again if you wish to continue using the lightning network.

Wait, is that correct?  I thought any trade whatsoever is taxable.... but you're saying it's only the trades to USD?
I guess if you have to cash out to USD eventually or will purchase something with those coins, you're gonna get taxed theoretically the same amount regardless of whether crypto to crypto trades are taxed.  Sigh....

Yup, thanks I just realized that as well:
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:17:53
Awesome to read this.
has played a huge role in my Bitcoin journey.  I remember years ago watching his videos on YouTube and pacing the floor of my apartment like a madman, blown away by Bitcoin.  I knew that I had to invest every penny that I could reasonably risk losing.  I bought in and hodled on for dear life, not giving a fuck about the dips.
Last week I paid off my student loans in full with only a small fraction of that investment and I am now debt free.  Unbelievable.  It makes me sad that Andreas isn't drowning in Bitcoin himself, but I'm glad that the community is giving back to him!

@_date: 2017-12-02 22:28:56
While I’m impressed with the KeepKey hardware and was initially impressed with the interface as well... it just hasn’t evolved since I bought it at all and is lacking in some basic features.  For example if I want to empty out a wallet completely, good luck figuring out how much to put in the text box because you don’t know what the fee will be and it keeps yelling at you that you have insufficient funds.  So you have to type the amount, get yelled at, reduce by a small amount, get yelled at... ok finally that’s the right amount. A “max” button would have made sense.
Also they’re slow to implement new features.  Would have had to wait ages for the bitcoin cash feature.  Or segwit, last I knew it is not implemented.  Ledger and Trezor get these new features immediately.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:39:46
I did exactly the same last week... When it was 10k.
Reaaaallly wish I had waited just one week but oh well.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:58:10
Right.  I think that more than just trying to think about how to thank the community, he must be trying to think about what he will do with the money.
He is probably juggling thoughts of investing the money into starting a new company.... or donating a portion of it to charity.
Personally, I hope that he doesn't do either of those things!  I hope that he just sits comfortably on the money and continues to travel all around the world doing what he does best - giving public talks on cryptocurrency.

I would describe him most concisely as the Carl Sagan of Bitcoin.  He is beloved for his talent of teaching the masses about Bitcoin, so to hear that he was basically broke only recently becoming debt free was alarming to many people.
Basically you have thousands of people who were inspired by Andreas years ago, it drove them to invest, and they're rich now.  To hear that the the guy who inspired their good fortune isn't also rich just doesn't sit right with them.
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:39:38

@_date: 2017-12-15 10:19:59
I've got some experience with Trezor and much experience with both Ledger Nano S and KeepKey.  Ledger wins hands down.
It has a nice user experience with stable and well designed software, is extremely secure, and receives new features very rapidly (segwit, new coins).
I think Trezor has a less homogenous user experience if you venture into other coins, and the seed recovery process is less secure.  KeepKey just feels almost like an abandoned product... They never add new features or coins or anything anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:35:40
I have to agree, but I find it an understandable choice.  The crypto community is like religion/cults lately, and if you say the wrong thing then you get the opposing cult trying to destroy you.
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:40:04
I'm not sure where I originally learned of how this works so I'm not sure the best source to provide.  Basically you have to commit to a lightning channel with a transaction on the blockchain, which will be timelocked... in other words the bitcoin will then be locked into the lightning channel for say 2 weeks, or 2 months, or whatever, and that bitcoin can only be used on the lightning channel during that time.  Then at the end of the timelock, everything is "settled" back onto the blockchain.  A good way to think of it is like a checking account, vs Bitcoin on the main network being a savings account.
Here's something from Wikipedia explaining a similar thing.  I don't have a better source, it's hard to find a good explanation.  I just know what I know from reading a few things here and there over time.


@_date: 2017-12-28 13:57:44
Ah, now that sounds pretty interesting.  Will read up on this later...  Thanks for the info and source.
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:35:47
Yup.  Dude is talking as if this is a sure thing.
I paid off my student loans when Bitcoin hit around 10k because I was certain it wouldn't last at that price.  Well I was right, 10k was very brief but the problem was it blew right past it instead of falling back down.  I can't complain but wish I hadn't done that and waited just one damned week longer.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:22:46
Right?  I'm not aware of Bitcoin ever going vertical as it has in the past few months without crashing back down hard.  It will settle higher than it started, but there's just no way for an asset to charge skyward at such blinding speed and find a new price gracefully.  The asset will overshoot and then correct down.
Honestly this bull run has been going for like 6+ months!  I was absolutely shocked that it didn't come crashing down shortly after $10k.  The absence of a crash would have been the shocking outcome.

@_date: 2017-12-08 10:00:08
No I think you're reading that wrong.... Maybe you're including the return address.  It was a 42 btc transaction so I think with the earlier donations he is somewhere around 1.6 million... Still really wonderful!
@_date: 2015-12-08 11:22:46
I've watched the presentation and could understand a fair bit of it.... but not everything.
What I'm still wondering though is, how much headroom does this really buy us?  Does our theoretical transaction per second go from 7 up to like... 10?  14?  20?  50?
I just don't think I've seen any hard estimates.

From this point on.... pretty much.
I did just sell a bunch this past week though, to eliminate my student loan in a single blow.  I invested a lot years ago and had never taken out a single penny.  If it all crashed to zero tomorrow I'd have nothing to show for it.  At least now I've made crazy profit and eliminated my loan, so everything I have in now is pure profit and it will have been worth the journey even if it fails.

@_date: 2017-12-28 11:00:00
My biggest concern with lightning network though is that the user has to incur a transaction fee on the main Bitcoin chain to get their Bitcoin into a lightning channel, and this only lasts for a limited period of time before they'd have to do it again.
So if you do only a few Bitcoin transactions a month and no more (like most people right now, let's be honest), then lightning isn't really going to help you at all.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2015-12-23 15:19:19

I have no idea what you're imagining, but if the device plugs in directly \(no flexible cable\) AND has buttons and a screen, there is no way that you can physically use the device without inevitably jarring your USB port and eventually damaging something.  The flexibility of the cable is absolutely necessary to protect the hardware of both the host and client devices.
Not to mention.... where are the ports located on most people's PC's?  On the tower, front or back... and maybe the tower is stored on the floor.
I get what your complaint is but there's no way to do it better .

I agree.   Competition may seem scary, but it's one of the only decent ways to pressure things to improve.
Sure, Bitcoin is already in competition with existing infrastructure, but without ETH and altcoins there would be no real competition for the higher potential functions of cryptocurrency which have not yet really been realized or utilized.  This is all good stuff, in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-05-30 20:42:19
Yeah, Bitcoin has in my experience has an interesting tenancy for the price to go parabolic almost on cue at the point where I stop caring about watching it every day.  Like if I don't check the price for a full week, that will trigger a bull run.

No, your criticism was fine, but you were told (I think by someone working for Trezor) exactly why they could not design it that way... sounds like they even tried to do it but it couldn't pass testing with that design.
Where you went wrong is that you wouldn't take that for an answer and you're doubling down on your idea, thinking that you know more about designing hardware than they do.
I've even had the same thought myself... it would be nice to not have to mess with a cable... but after thinking it through I realized that this would not work, and it was just confirmed in this thread by Trezor that it doesn't work in practice.  If you're running a company and you want to sell hardware, you have to do everything you can to minimize hardware failure as this is in the interest of both the customer and your own company.  That is the responsible thing to do, and that is what they have done.
You should continue to ask questions like this in the future, but learn to spot the practical reality when you see it and have some humility.

@_date: 2018-05-29 14:56:32
You are comparing Bitcoin hardware wallets to other security devices which are used very differently.  It's not a fair comparison but you're pretending like it is.  Recovering a 24-word seed on a crypto hardware wallet takes a *large* number of keypresses.  If Trezor designed their product the way that you want it, they would have huge numbers of angry customers with broken Trezors, and would have to shell out a lot of money to replace those devices.  It's that simple.
Yes, making the device as you wish is possible.  But the hardware failure rate would drastically increase.  Those are the facts.
Your ego is flailing.
@_date: 2018-05-25 15:07:05
Yeah I can't believe how little vision most people have.
It's like they can only see what "is" right now, and completely fail to evaluate the potential of anything.
I know a lot of people who came into crypto trading during the frenzy in late 2017... Traded, maybe lost money or broke even, and now they're just out of the market completely even though they think this stuff is the future.  I can't comprehend.

Do those devices have both screens and buttons, and the user needs to interact heavily with the device every time they use it, perhaps doing 100+ button presses in one session?  Oh ok, I didn't think so.
Here is my suggestion.  Start your own company, make a hardware wallet using the open source Trezor design which is already available, and allow this device to plug in directly without a cable.  This should be pretty lucrative if it's a feature that people want which is not available from any manufacturers.
When you receive an overwhelming number of support tickets from people requesting replacements because their device doesn't work anymore, or they ruined their USB port on their expensive laptop/PC, consider redesigning the device.

You care about that.  I care about that.  Most people don't give a rat's ass about that.
When your average first world citizen sees some end that he wants to achieve which is possible with bitcoin and not possible with USD, they will purchase bitcoin and the price should increase because of it... right now, there ain't much there except for some dark market spending.
And it's the same story for 2nd and 3rd world citizens, the only difference being that they may not even have traditional banking in the first place.
I don't foresee the price increasing otherwise though.  Demand needs to be based on something real at this point.

I don't really understand why people always say this.  The government taxes people with the threat of imprisonment.  It's pretty rare that they'd actually deduct money from a person's bank account without their "consent".
Do you think that if you acquire millions of dollars of income in bitcoin that they won't be able to tax you?  "Aw shucks, he's got bitcoin guys... he's untaxable!"
No, they'll just lock you up the same as they would if you had dollars if you choose not to pay the piper.

I would recommend just listening to it.  The first 30 minutes was the interview, then 10 minutes of review afterwards.  It was very entertaining, if not cringeworthy.
She was just spitting out a buzzword salad, and they weren't having any of it.  They challenged her technical knowledge at every point where it seemed apparent that she was just saying words without knowing the meaning behind them.
Some highlights were:
* She said that blockchain is going to revolutionize the medical industry.  When asked how and why, her answer was basically just "security".
* They asked her to define the word blockchain, considering that she has a blog named Beauty of the Blockchain... she gave a weak answer saying that it's a system of value transfer.  They asked her if ACH and SWIFT are blockchains, and she said yes.  Later on she denied saying that.
* Called her out for not being able to properly vet bitcoin companies that she works with for scammers due to her lack of knowledge.
* At the end, they just came out and put her in her place, saying that they think she has no technical understanding of this stuff whatsoever.
Honestly it was a good listen if you have a stomach for cringe.  I'd recommend it.

I think his point is that the FDA is so slow bureaucratic and people often die because of it who otherwise should have been saved.  Life saving treatments are often held back by their bureaucracy.  For example the fact that it took the USA an extra 15-20 years to start using the Chicken Pox vaccine.  Their suppression of fecal transplants.  The suppression of an upcoming Herpes vaccination (see Dr. William Halford.. he is not even trying to work with the FDA anymore out of frustration).
While at the same time, dangerous drugs are frequently deemed safe by the FDA and end up killing people before being recalled (Vioxx, many others).  I can only guess it's because money is what really greases their wheels rather than a drive to do good for the world.

All of the other retails will be stumbling over themselves to do the same thing.
Get fucking real.

Do you actually believe that if Home Depot stopped accepting Visa and Mastercard and instead switched to bitcoin tomorrow that their stock wouldn't go into a complete freefall?  Do you think that decision could possibly result in anything besides their profits evaporating overnight and their nearly half a million employees losing their jobs due to the company folding in short time?

The whole recovery phrase thing is a bitcoin feature (BIP39), rather than being something that the Mycelium developers created.

Ethereum Classic is selling for 1/20th the price as the main Ethereum.  Bitcoin cash is selling for less than 1/6th the price of Bitcoin.  It will very likely trend towards zero over time, and the main bitcoin price is nearly at an all-time high.
Forks will happen, but the inferior coin will trend towards zero.  It has happened before as well, with Bitcoin Unlimited, XT, etc...

Yes, it is harder when you have to sort through probably a dozen apps which are simply malware which will try to steal your BTC.  Then you have to understand how to properly store the Bitcoin and if you're dealing with any decent amount of money, you need to make your own backups.  You could lose your phone and lose all your money along with it if you don't understand that.  It's far more difficult and risky to deal with Bitcoin at this point in time.
Your thinking is delusional.  I love Bitcoin and want it to succeed and I think that it will in the end... and I've invested a fair sum.  But I'm not going to tell myself lies about how easy it is to use and handle.

Yes, anyone who has a decent technical understanding of Bitcoin and information technology in general should have cringed intensely at that line.
Prior to 2009 when Bitcoin came about, 100&amp; of databases in the world were NOT blockchains.  15 years from even now, the percent of databases in the world that are NOT blockchains will likely still be something like 99&amp;
Blockchains come with extremely large drawbacks, which quickly rule it out as the storage method of choice in most cases.
Basically, does your application NEED the data to be decentralized and immutable?  No?  Then don't use a fucking blockchain, because the inefficiency of using a blockchain is almost outrageous in so many ways and it's only "worth it" if you need that decentralization/immutability.  So far the only application where a blockchain has any track record of being truly useful is money/store of value (Bitcoin).

You cannot predict it with anything remotely approaching certainty.
You'll have little trouble finding a bunch of idiots *claiming* that they know where the price is going, but rest assured they're just making shit up.  There are naturally going to be rare events where someone knows something that's about to hit and affect the price in a big way such as whales who are about to make a move or maybe the Winklevoss twins will know when their ETF is about to hit... but for every person who actually knows something and is also willing to share that info, there will be 100 morons who don't know anything but talk as if they do.

Wow, having a bad day buddy?  Sorry to hear it.
It's like you didn't even read my comment.  Tell me, what percentage of gold went into industrial processes and non jewelry  manufacturing 2,000 years ago, and was gold highly valuable at that time?
EDIT: Also you're wrong in your claim that 50% of gold out of the ground is used in industrial processes.  I can see where you made a logical error in interpreting an article in your other post.  The article said that 50% of gold is used for jewelry and you made the assumption that the rest is used for industrial purposes.  But it is not.  You're forgetting about coins, gold bars and bouillon.  According to this article, it's over 83% of all gold that is used for non-industrial purposes (jewelry, coins, bars and other "shiny" forms):
So basically, you're completely ignorant, have demonstrated poor reading comprehension of both user comments and of articles, and you're a rude son of a bitch to boot.  Reevaluate yourself.
@_date: 2018-06-26 16:32:47


Gold had a similar extremely high value before we were using it for any of those things with the exception of jewelry.... and jewelry is easily the least utilitarian of those things, to boot.
Gold is valuable because it's shiny and rare.  That's pretty much it, and that's why it has always been jewelry.  Nobody in ancient Rome was raving about the electrical conductivity of gold, they didn't care, or even realize it.  The "usefulness" of gold barely factors into its high price, clearly.

Yeah, I was getting the impression that she's describing something akin to a "tragedy of the commons" situation in that if all countries did the right thing and had sane monetary policies, the whole world would be better off and more stable.... but in reality any country that plays along to the insane policies will be greatly advantaged, whereas if you do "the right thing" you will be left behind.  Kind of sad.
On a side note, did anyone else feel like she wasn't able to get all the way through her presentation, and once the first guy asked a question she was just inundated with questions from there on out?

Ok well originally you said "I am opposed to all 2nd layer scaling." but it sounds like you're walking that back a bit.  
Either way we shall see, but I can tell you for sure that I don't expect to be able to host a node if we scale on chain.
10 years ago in 2007, the first 1 terabyte consumer hard drive was released.  What do people own these days?  I have a 6 TB hard disk and that's way more than most people have.
10 years from now, I expect Bitcoin to have achieved something like worldwide adoption, but I do NOT expect to be able to accommodate 700 GB added to the blockchain *per day* on a node ran by anything besides a large corporation.

Essentially the "money" (USD) comes from suckers who believe in the future success of the alternate coin for whatever reason, so they're willing to pay you that money for your coins because they expect an increase in value in the future.... of course, they're probably wrong.

Enough with the Satoshi's vision shit.  You sound like a religious zealot.  It is an empty appeal to authority.
Try presenting a reasoned argument instead.  Scaling on the second layer makes infinitely more sense than brutishly scaling up the blocksize.  Serious question, please answer this - What happens to the decentralization of bitcoin when it reaches something approaching full mass adoption worldwide, and we are storing everything from the mortgage payments of folks in China to the morning coffee transactions in the USA - all on a single blockchain?  How large do you think those blocks would be, and do you think that bitcoin will still be decentralized?  Will you be able to run your own node?
Fuck no.  You'd need a multi-million dollar data center with 24/7 staff support to host a node.  That is not "Satoshi's vision" as if that matters, it's a laughably crude scaling solution.

I'm not sure about that because it's still mostly just speculative buying.  As I was saying, we're at about 1mb blocks and to compete with Visa we would need over 5gb blocks.  Obviously that won't happen and we'll do second layer scaling.... But what happens to the price when we're at Visa levels of traffic?  Gonna be insanity.

Segwit effectively offers a blocksize increase by increasing efficiency.  And that's not even taking into account the possibilities opened up with second layer scaling which is currently in the works which BCash and yourself seem to abhor for some odd reason.
But you didn't answer clearly my questions as I knew you wouldn't.  I'll ask again:
*What happens to the decentralization of bitcoin when it reaches something approaching full mass adoption worldwide, and we are storing everything from the mortgage payments of folks in China to the morning coffee transactions in the USA - all on a single blockchain? How large do you think those blocks would be, and do you think that bitcoin will still be decentralized? Will you be able to run your own node?*
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:48:19


That right there is pretty clever indeed....
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:46:08
The Bitcoin network is currently at roughly 380,000 transactions in the past 24 hours at the current blocksize limit.
The VISA network is claimed to be capable of roughly 2,000,000,000 (2 billion) transactions per day (24,000 per second cited below).
 
So for Bitcoin to have the same capability as VISA **on-chain**, it needs to increase the blocksize by 5,400(ish) times.  And this is just the VISA network.  We're not talking about MasterCard or other providers, or Swift, or PayPal, or any other payment systems that Bitcoin aspires to replace.
If we hit that adoption S-curve in the near future, are you going to be capable of negotiating and storing a minimum 5.4 Gb blocks on your node?  Can you handle almost 1 terabyte per day in additional storage?  How big is your hard drive in your node?  How fast is your internet connection?  How fast was it 1 year ago / 2 years ago / 5 years ago / 10 years ago, assuming you haven't made a huge jump in how much you pay for some plan?
2nd layer scaling is absolutely required.

@_date: 2017-11-16 16:47:34
I think that a lot of the issue is just plain ignorance on the technical aspects of how to scale a network to a massive size.  You don't just brutishly increase the blocksize to infinity, that makes very little sense in the long term and is a comically simple minded approach.

**Why the Needham Bitcoin Price Prediction Got a 29% Bump to $848
By DAVID ZEILER, Associate Editor, Money Morning •  • September 23, 2016**
A revised Bitcoin price prediction from Needham &amp; Co. has raised the digital currency's estimated present value from $655 to $848.
The updated estimate, a 29% jump, comes just six months after Needham made its original Bitcoin price prediction in a report dated March 29.
While technically an analysis of the Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTCMKTS: GBTC), a fund for accredited investors, the report focuses heavily on the potential of Bitcoin.
Report author Spencer Bogart said the estimate warranted revision "due to faster-than-expected adoption and improving fundamentals," adding that planned improvements to the Bitcoin protocol will also help boost the Bitcoin price.
"At the highest level, we continue to see value in Bitcoin as a 'digital gold' and as a payment network that is enabling a global, open, permissionless financial system," Bogart wrote in the Sept. 22 report.
Needham's March 29 Bitcoin price prediction proved to be exceptionally timely.
At that time, the price of Bitcoin was about $415. A little more than two months later (June 11), the Bitcoin price breached $600. The very next day it hit $675, surpassing the $655 estimate.
Bitcoin price prediction
The price of Bitcoin continued to surge in the days after that, peaking at about $775. Bitcoin retreated after that, but was trading in the $650 range until the Bitfinex Bitcoin exchange security breach in early August.
In that incident, about $65 million worth of Bitcoin was stolen from Bitfinex customers. That knocked the Bitcoin price down to $550 before it recovered to $600, where it has remained since.
Nevertheless, Needham said it had noted Bitcoin's significant progress in several key areas. In fact, Needham was impressed at how quickly the Bitcoin price rebounded in the wake of the Bitfinex news, saying that the recovery at least in part was "due to greater confidence in Bitcoin's future."
Here's a deeper look at the other reasons Needham felt compelled to hike both its short-term and its long-term Bitcoin price predictions…
What's Behind Needham's Higher Bitcoin Price Prediction
Needham's case for boosting its Bitcoin price prediction is based on three central ideas: that it is increasingly behaving like other investment classes; that adoption is accelerating; and that changes to the software itself will make it more useful.
Bitcoin has endured a lot of criticism for its flaws compared to conventional investments, particularly its high volatility and limited liquidity. But that's been changing, Needham found.
"Bitcoin's daily volatility is now comparable to small-cap equities," Bogart wrote.
Where Bitcoin's volatility is about 3.3%, the Standard &amp; Poor's Small Cap 600 is 2.6%. The report also notes that some tech stocks and oil prices are slightly more volatile than Bitcoin now.
Regarding liquidity, Bogart wrote that "Bitcoin's daily dollar volume roughly resembles that of a U.S. mid-cap security," even just using the top five Bitcoin exchanges where the digital currency can be traded for U.S. dollars.
Liquidity — the ability to buy and sell an investment as needed — is a vital consideration, as no one wants to be stuck in a position they cannot exit. Bogart noted that investing in Bitcoin even has some advantages in terms of liquidity, as the Bitcoin exchanges are open 24/7.
Another appealing aspect of Bitcoin is that its price moves have virtually no correlation with other investments. That makes it appealing as an investing hedge to guard against sudden price drops in other asset classes.
Regarding adoption, Bogart notes that transaction volume has had a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 224% since January of 2013, and it has more than tripled over the past year. The acceleration in transaction volume was a key factor in Needham's decision to raise its Bitcoin price prediction.
In addition to the overall increase in adoption, Needham cited the increasing appeal of Bitcoin to emerging markets. Bitcoin offers very desirable features to these populations, including fast and easy cross-border transactions (for remittances) and a refuge from unreliable domestic currencies, such as we've seen in Venezuela.
Finally, Needham saw great promise in new technologies coming to Bitcoin…
Why the Bitcoin Price Will Quadruple from Here
Because Bitcoin is software, its code can be updated and improved to address problems as well as add new capabilities.
Needham sees these upcoming changes to the Bitcoin code as a major positive.
"We see a multitude of developments throughout the Bitcoin ecosystem that are poised to move from conceptual to real over the next 3-7 months – each of which could augment Bitcoin's features and functionality and, consequently, increase demand for Bitcoin," Bogart wrote.
Needham sees all these forces converging to drive up the price of Bitcoin over the next few years.
In March, Needham projected that the Bitcoin price would reach $1,896 by 2020.
But the new report raises that estimate to $2,231 – a 272% increase over the current price of Bitcoin.
"Contrary to popular narrative, we see Bitcoin's fundamentals trending very favorably," Bogart wrote. "We find the outlook very encouraging, and we believe the short- to intermediate-term horizon is among the most exciting Bitcoin has seen."

Everytime the price goes in one direction, there would have been half the people saying it would have gone in the opposite direction.  We're all just gambling with better than average odds of winning in the long term.
It's not unreasonable to just hold if you don't feel confident that you know what the price will do.  That's mostly what I've been doing and it's been fantastic.
I did sell a large amount at $10k when it was on the way up in November because I was thinking this price was absolutely fucking ridiculous and it had to crash back down.  I was very disappointed in my move come December when it just kept climbing, but now I feel glad that I did it.
I could have just as easily gotten screwed and missed out on a legit rally though... You always have that risk when you sell.  But I would say as a rule, if you experience 10x or 20x growth on your investment, it's time to sell 10% of it!

Gold's intrinsic value is not proportional to its actual trade value though. It has desirable properties for electronics, but it was trading at a very high value way before we even discovered electricity... so it's hard to argue that those properties in particular matter whatsoever.
It is a metal that has a very unique color and it stays shiny without corroding over time.  That's pretty much the extent of it's intrinsic value.  2,000 years ago, there weren't many practical purposes for it.  Can't make an axe worth a shit, or any effective tools.  Just jewelry.  It is shiny and rare, that's the value.
Anyway, I don't see the case for gold's intrinsic value as being much stronger than the case for Bitcoin's intrinsic value as a rare (nothing similar even existed prior) trustless medium of exchange and store of value.  They both have value, but that value only really exists in context.

That might be true but that's where network effects come in.  Facebook is king of social networking because it has a network effect which cannot be beaten.  Bitcoin and Ethereum are both developing incredibly strong network effects, and there comes a point where you cannot compete.
And to keep running with the social networking analogy, you've got Facebook and Twitter and Instagram which are all extremely powerful and they coexist in relative harmony because they can fill different niches (general social network on FB, small mindless messages on Twitter, photos on Instagram).  Crypto might similarly end up with not a single winner takes all scenario but having a handful of players who each fill a niche, and each cannot be overthrown for their own particular niche due to dozens of platforms being built on top of them creating a rock solid network effect.

I agree partly with what you're saying in that secure handling of bitcoin is too difficult for the average Joe to do properly.... but I don't see why that means another crypto would succeed where bitcoin fails, as this is a fundamental problem with all crypto assuming that it's decentralized and immutable.
I would imagine that in the end cryptocurrency will become the backbone of the whole financial world, but 10 years from now you won't see individual users dicking around with actual bitcoin on their Windows machines.... it will probably be mostly custodial accounts or at least some next-gen form of hardware wallets may become ubiquitous.

The private keys can be "backed up" via the export of a recovery seed.  This recovery seed is 12-24 random words that you write down on a piece of paper.  Using that recovery seed, you can restore the keys to just about any hardware or software wallet, as it's a standard implementation for bitcoin.  Of course you need to treat that piece of paper (recovery seed) as if it is your actual money, because with it someone can get your funds, so use good physical security... but the hardware wallet is primarily for protection from digital attacks.
For updates, I don't know all of the devices but if I'm not mistaken Trezor is designed such that you may load custom firmwares, however if you do so then there is a warning displayed on the device's screen every single time you use it.  The only people who can make a firmware without that warning displaying would be the creators of Trezor, as they have the master private key with which to sign the firmware properly.  As long as that key doesn't get compromised, a signed firmware is trustworthy.
Hardware wallets aren't 100% foolproof but they are by far the most secure way to handle bitcoin.   I think that anyone with more than $1,000 or so in BTC should use one... maybe even less, because the value of coins has a tendency to multiply 10x every now and then.

In other words, if a person is moving their funds from a non segwit address into a segwit, and then it just sits there as they HODL, they're not even showing up on this chart?  If so, I'd like to see the percentage of new addresses which are segwit..... maybe the segwit usage is kind of increasing more than we think.

Encryption implies decryption.  There is no data to be decrypted in bitcoin.
It's all digital signatures and hashing.
EDIT: Maybe I suppose you use encryption in something like a BIP38 encrypted wallet, but that's not the core protocol.

Then why are you in the Bitcoin subreddit?  Just stay in @_date: 2017-10-12 01:21:38
You back up your recovery phrase on to a piece of paper.  It would be 24 words which are used to recover the Bitcoin on to a new device if needed, and can also restore in to any wallet that supports the recovery phrase bip (pretty much all of them).  You can make multiple copies, but not too many copies.... Anyone who finds the recovery phrase can get your money.
Essentially the hardware wallet has all the security of an offline paper wallet, yet is spendable like any other wallet. Best of both worlds.

That's just silly.  Using a VM is better than not using one, but using a hardware wallet reduces the routes of attack by very close to 100%.
If I had a few hundred bucks I wouldn't bother with one.... but if you have thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands... millions of dollars?  You'd have to be just plain mental to keep the keys on your daily driver PC, even if it's inside a VM.  Is a 95% feeling of safety good enough for protecting sums of money which could ruin or disrupt your life if lost, when you could have 100%?  Spend another $100 and be safe with your money.
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:20:08

The Russia story IS a conspiracy theory.  But that's the part that's too hilarious and sad.  The most gullible portion of the US population are so distrustful of the usual government that they will actually believe the most extreme and ridiculous theories on pizzagate from Alex Jones.... Yet when an actual real conspiracy is staring them in the face and we see Donald Trump Jr lying up and down about a meeting with Russians, Manafort and Flynn up to their eyeballs in damning evidence against them, and countless other reasons to be highly suspicious of the Donald Trump campaign.... They don't believe it. The average supporter is so gullible and religious in their support for the man that they will believe any and all conspiracy theories which portray their enemies as "bad" and will not believe anything unbecoming of their demigod.
Mueller is not going to tweet out every inane thought that pops into his head as this investigation continues like Trump would. He's a professional and understands to put this head down and do his job carefully.  So we will just have to wait a while until the evidence is truly overwhelming to even the die hard Trump supporter, but that day will come.  Although I suppose some will never turn, no matter what happens.  Those are the people who truly cannot think.

You think that Bitcoin would have had a stable buying power just by virtue of being the unit of account?  Even while the userbase increases by 10x in a few years over a limited supply of coin, and it's traded like crazy by a rapidly swelling and shrinking trader demographic?
You're just out of your mind if you believe that.  It's comical. Stability of the price will only be achieved with stability of the userbase.... and who knows when that might actually happen.

@_date: 2017-10-16 14:24:48
Absolutely not true.
The magic of a Trezor, KeepKey or Ledger is that the private keys are stored in such a way on the device that it is [probably] impossible for the private keys to leave the device over that USB cable, meaning you are near 100% shielded from hackers.
When you try to spend funds from a Trezor, the host PC will say to the Trezor, "hey we want to send $x amount of BTC to address xxxxx, can you please prepare the transaction?" .... then the Trezor will build the transaction, sign it, and send it to the host PC to be broadcast over the internet.  The private keys never left the Trezor, only a signed transaction using those keys.
This is why it's safe in a way that a typical USB stick never could be.  It gets you pretty close to being immune to malware.  (it at least cuts out a large majority of attack vectors)
Think of it like an offline computer that just has very limited interactions with the host PC.

If you had enough Bitcoin to buy a car a few years ago, you can use that same amount to buy a house now.  But if that's usd you were holding, it still just buys a car.

I was listening to Joe Rogan Experience this morning, with Peter Schiff as the guest (happened a few days ago).
Peter talked about this debate and says he thinks that it was rigged.  He claims that people were intentionally voting at the beginning that they were neutral or against bitcoin (regardless of their actual view), and then voted at the end that they changed their mind to be positive towards it to create the illusion that Eric won the debate.
That might even be true, but the fact is that he still lost the debate.  I didn't even know that it was voted on and still see that he got trounced.  He just doesn't have a sufficient understanding of the technology of Bitcoin or of the context of technology in general to make predictions here.  He understands money, but he doesn't understand tech.  To have an intelligent opinion on crypto, you need to understand both.

But imagine all of the emails that he would have to answer if control of Bitcoin's code was put into the hands of a handful of mediocre developers, rather than the dream team of some of the worlds best talent that is Core.
I think that's the most important part of all of this honestly.  Success will be where the talent is.  Bitcoin Core is absolutely where the best talent is.
I see a decent analogy in movies, music, and video games.  How many times does this happen where a once-great band has a shakeup and then end up with a different frontman, and they're just shit now.  Or a movie franchise gets resurrected from the dead, but it's garbage because there's a totally different crew and director behind the scenes.
Or of course a video game sequel is done, but by a different studio than that which did the original, since there was a buyout... and it just doesn't have the same magic anymore.
That's all because the creators/developers are what matters the most.  It seems so obvious yet people lose sight of this fact.  Follow the talent.  The best creators will create the best stuff.
Bitcoin Cash and Segwit2x don't have the talent.

Market cap does not equal net worth.
I could make my own coin tomorrow.  There will be 10 million coins and they will all be pre-mined to me.  I will then sell a coin to my friend for $1.  That doesn't mean that my new coin has $10 million in value.
Bill Gates on the other hand owns a huge and diverse portfolio of assets, plus I'm sure a ridiculous amount of USD.
Bitcoin of course has a huge number of people trading and so the market cap of BTC is far more meaningful there than my silly example, but the concept is still there.

Right, efficiency is king when it comes to scaling.  Solely increasing the blocksize is the most simplistic brute force solution to the problem.  It takes no ingenuity whatsoever and has extreme costs in the long term.
If winter time comes and your house keeps getting colder and colder but has no insulation, adding insulation (efficiency) is a much better solution than simply cranking the thermostat up higher and higher (brute force).  In the long term, you will expend FAR less resources by increasing efficiency.

True, but the thing is that nobody seems to be even remotely capable of educating those people on what this device would allow you to do which was not already easily possible using less expensive parts.
If it really seems like there's no good answer to that question, the negativity is kind of understandable, especially in the bitcoin space where scams are so common.  People are just apprehensive whether this passes the smell test.

I think we live in a really interesting time because we do not yet have a "one world government", however the entire planet is more or less connected in terms of communication... That's unprecedented and I doubt it would continue forever as governments will probably merge and consolidate.
This means that bitcoin would need to be banned on a government by government basis but as many have said this would only serve to cut that country off from the global bitcoin economy, which we hope will continue to grow.

If Bitcoin were the unit of account, retailers would have to change their price tags daily, maybe even hourly, or else risk going out of business.  Again, if you have 21 bitcoin a few years ago, you might buy a car.  Now you can buy a house with it.
The only point of money is to be exchanged for goods and services.  1 BTC = 1 BTC is a meaningless statement.  You have to compare it to a stable currency such as USD, which has kept its buying power within the same ballpark for many years, or you compare it to the goods which you can by.  You don't compare it to itself.

Yeah man... I bought in at $570... on the way down to $200.  Stung at first but I'm a good hodler.  Was trying to convince my brother that he should buy some back then, as he makes a high end salary as a software dev in Manhattan and has been very focused on making sound investments in the past decade.  I've told him so many times, but now I just leave him alone because I don't want to be a dick.
We did talk a little bit about it recently as well as the price is now like 20x what it had been when I was urging him to just buy a single coin.  Now he says that there's no point since it's already as high as it will ever be basically.... I'm still like, no dude... either it's going to near zero or it's going sky high from here.  Whatever.
Similar story with my uncle, only his holdup was just not being comfortable with understanding how it works and how to handle it.  I almost helped him buy a coin at $600 but we didn't go through with it.  But now I've helped him buy some at the price of $4k... and he also bough ETH around that time.  He's pretty pleased with it and he also owns a hardware wallet now.

This is something that I've noticed.  The outrageously fast price increases tend to occur when breaking NEW ground in price, not when recovering from a previous megacrash.
Look at the price during the last runup/crash/runup.  Price went up insanely fast to over $1,200 which was uncharted territory, and then crashed and burned fairly quickly down to like $200.  The recovery up to over $1,000 again felt like ages, and it really was in "Bitcoin time"... a couple years, very slow.  Once that price got back to the all-time high again though?  That's when the rocket fuel seems to kick in, apparently.
I'd expect a slow recovery to around $18,000 or $20k and then things might get insane again as it lights a fomo fire underneath all the noobs.

That bitcoin will be the one to win also seems high probability, but significantly less so.  The numbers that I might pull out of my butt are 99.9% crypto gets huge, and 90% that bitcoin itself comes along for the ride.

Hmm... lightning network can split bitcoin smaller than even bitcoin can?
I'm actually not understanding how this could work.  Suppose that this same guy tips him like this a million times.  Then certainly, he will have a sum of bitcoin which is large enough to be settled on the actual blockchain, and that's all fine.
But what if he received tips this small from millions of people, and then he wanted to settle the payment channel?  Of course he has enough bitcoin from his lightning channel to settle the payment, but the sender's addresses would be much too small for those deductions to register on the actual blockchain.... so where would his gained bitcoin come from?
@_date: 2018-04-09 19:39:38
But that's the thing... it makes sense with normal amounts of bitcoin, but think about this example again.
You have a bitcoin balance in a lightning channel, and then you do something which goes viral, like a funny video, and you receive, let's say 1,000,000 satoshis total from 1,000,000,000 unique people and the sum was contributed perfectly evenly amount the senders (yes not practical but still).  So you have one million satoshis owed to you through these lightning channels, but every single sender sent 1/1,000th of a satoshi to you.  You cannot settle 1/1,000th of a satoshi on the blockchain, so how is anything deducted from the senders addresses when settlement occurs?
You'd have gained 1,000,000 satoshis but where did it come from?  I'm sure there's a decent answer somewhere, I just don't get it.
@_date: 2018-04-09 10:54:34

I have to agree with you.  I didn't even realize it a couple of years ago, but we can't even handle scaling now and we're still in the speculation phase.

* Slow download speeds, never goes over 1Mb/sec whereas uTorrent would usually go a full 3.2Mb/sec
* Ugly as hell interface, icons are like 15 years ago Linux.  This isn't a big deal though as long as it would just download fast!

It's like when you're a child and there's some other dipshit 10 year old who says he drives a Ferrari and bangs whores every weekend... you know he's just full of shit to the point where it's actually funny... but you assume that this is just something that kids do, and when a person becomes an adult they'll leave behaviors like that behind.  Of course, all of the adults in the world must hold themselves to SOME standard of honesty and self-respect, as far as you can tell...
But no, if that little dipshit who can't stop telling lies is mentally deranged enough, he'll probably keep this behavior up his entire life!  So many adults are really just children.
At least Craig Wright isn't like eating people.  But still, it really disturbs me.

I think that this is a very common misconception around here.  If you've only heard about ASIC's through bitcoin, it's natural to think this... but ASIC's can do anything that they're built for.
It stands for "Application Specific Integrated Circuit".  They're everywhere.  For example, your phone probably has an ASIC which  can do nothing except for decode H.264 video.  Why?  Because it will consume an extremely small amount of power compared to the inefficient general purpose processor that you've also got in there.  So by having an ASIC in there, you can watch video on your phone for a lot longer than you could if the main CPU were being used.   But that chip cannot do anything at all except for decode video.

Yes, but this is where BIP38 encryption comes in.  If you can encrypt the paper wallets with a strong password, your safety is enormous because they'd need to steal the safe AND THEN have a lengthy amount of time to crack the password (if that's even within their skillset which it likely is not).   So if your safe gets stolen, use a backup to just transfer the bitcoins to new paper wallets and the thief would be wasting time trying to crack an empty wallet.

Sometimes some debt is ok... like if you want to go into a profession which requires a lot of education, you'll probably have to take on some student loans.  And it's ok because you will be better off in the end for doing that (as long as we're not talking about women's studies dance therapy or something silly).
What's ridiculous to me though is the way that so many people are willing to take on MULTIPLE sources of debt at the same time, almost without even considering their existing debt when making that decision to take on more... like it doesn't even exist.
Debt for house + car + college + credit card balance + buying a new guitar on a "plan".... that's when shit gets outrageous and people are behaving like idiots.

For the millionth time, the main issue that people have with the 21 computer is not even ROI.
It's that it is just a few parts merged together in a way that you could easily do yourself... and yes, on top of that the cost is very questionable.  The fact that the mining rig is preconfigured to work with what is basically a raspberry pi is especially strange to me since the type of person who would actually accomplish anything with this computer already has the know-how to build their own equivalent system for FAR cheaper.  That is why people find it very strange, and their marketing pitch is just not making any sense.
That's on them, they need to communicate the value of this machine to their potential buyers.  Right now it just isn't making much sense why anyone should purchase it.

People always say this kind of thing... but it doesn't make any sense.  We already have a "Fedcoin" - it's the USD.
The massive energy expenditure that is "mining" is the engineering price that you have to pay to have an open, secure and decentralized solution.  If you want a coin on the other hand that is closed and centralized, which is what you describe, then mining is utterly pointless.  Just do things the old fashioned way with banks.  It would be much cheaper that way.  There's no reason to mine transactions.  Just have the banks do the transactions the same way that they do them now.
Mining is not an inherently GOOD thing and is certainly not efficient, it's just a necessary evil because there's no other way that we know of to keep an open and decentralized currency honest.  If the currency is going to be closed and centralized, safe yourself some kWh and do it the old fashioned way.
What you're saying just doesn't really make sense.

Before people start getting the wrong impression here, note that Google did not write a single line of code with bitcoin in mind to make this happen.
This is simply a general purpose algorithm where Google tries to understand what you are searching for, and in those instances where it is very "confident" that it understands what you want and it has the answer, it will spit the answer out before any of your links/search results.  So it's very cool but this doesn't mean Google has a hard-on for bitcoin.

Meh.  What percentage of your income goes to directly paying other people back borrowed cash (or whatever)?  Probably far less than 1%.  It's not much of an issue.  Bitcoin is cool but Paypal is perfectly sufficient (and far easier for anyone to understand) for the usecase of sending your parents $100.
I don't see any single retailer adoption as a "tipping point".  I think that a tipping point would only occur in a third world country, or possibly remittances.  It will happen when all of a sudden a group of people are able to do something that was impossible before in their daily life... in other words people who don't have access to any form of legitimate banking or VISA services can all of a sudden make online payments.  Maybe it would be the creation of an Amazon-like company in a third world country.  And even then it would probably only be a tipping point in that country.
I'm not saying that I'm not optimistic about this whole thing obviously, I just don't think that first-world retailers accepting bitcoin is going to spark a revolution and get the other 99.99% of the population on board with bitcoin.  That makes very little sense to me.

I just couldn't believe the ridiculousness of Craig Wright claiming to be Satoshi.  Like seriously, think about it.
The guy is claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto, so his claim to fame would be inventing a revolutionary network of trust the likes of which the world has never seen.... yet he cannot appreciate that the world will not trust that claim unless he can utilize that same network to prove his ownership of certain private keys?  He cannot understand why the world thinks it is insufficient for him to privately "demonstrate" that he has the keys to Gavin behind closed doors, meaning that Gavin has to just trust him that he's not performing a con (which Gavin stupidly did fall for), and then the world now has to blindly trust both Craig AND Gavin, without seeing this for ourselves?  If there is anyone in the entire world who should appreciate the dynamics of trust, and indisputably proving a fact to the world, is it not Satoshi Nakamoto?  This guy seems to understand those things about as well as my grandma.
Fucking hilarious.  You have got to be kidding me.  Even now after so long, just thinking about the audacity of this guys claim boggles my mind.

But even Amazon... why would that be game changing?  People need an incentive to hold and spend bitcoins.
With Amazon many people already use one-click buy.  If you're going to tell people that now you can buy bitcoins on Coinbase and then spend them on Amazon, a legitimate response to that is "why?" .  What is the point?
That's why retailer adoption is neat but isn't revolutionary at all.  Bitcoin needs to do things that aren't even currently possible if it is going to revolutionize the world.  I'm sure that there are use cases for it in the works, but just spending bitcoins at Amazon isn't going to excite anyone who was not already excited about bitcoin.

I agree with your points.
Bitcoin is in a tough spot because for *whatever* reason, the network is rejecting a perfectly good software upgrade (segwit) which is in turn holding it back from having even a prayer at handling another order of magnitude increase in userbase.
All the while, another coin (ethereum) is now matching bitcoin in volume and transactions per day, and starting to get very close in terms of market cap.  This competitor also has NO blocksize limit and NO transaction malleability issues.
This year could be a major turning point for bitcoin if it doesn't get its shit together.  Network effect will all of a sudden mean bullshit when your network size ranks number 2 and the network that's beating you is technically superior in the ways that matter most.

Difficulty does not adjust on every block... only every 2016 blocks.  So it's absolutely conceivable to be stuck mining 30, 40, 50 minute blocks for a long time.

Holy shit, I didn't realize this.  That's a massive relief to me... I thought I was going to get hit with like 30% tax on these coins eventually.

I think he just means that the most trading activity takes place in China.

But isn't this pretty much exactly what KeepKey did?

Really cool chart, thanks.

Dude he almost blew up the entire planet with his top secret illegal explosives smuggling operation.

Well it looks like you managed to score an upvote from someone at least!  Hahaha

So simple, great to see it laid out as such.
I hope some of the goofballs working on their "private blockchains" will see this and just think about it for a little while.

Huh?  They don't lend out *more* than was deposited in, but they do lend out a *fraction* of it.  That's what fractional reserve means.
And that is considered a form of money creation because as they lend out deposits, the depositor balances stay the same, even though that money isn't actually inside the bank anymore and was lent out.  So the total of depositor balances plus lendee balances is greater than what was originally deposited.  Money was "created" and it didn't require lending "more" than was originally deposited....unless this process is repeated over and over at a tiny reserve percentage.
So anyway, I don't see how there are two distinct layers there.

If you follow the link in the original post where that was mentioned, there is an image.  Looks like you can use some kind of hub/splitter to do it.
Why would you?  No freaking idea.  Maybe to more easily transfer from one wallet to the other in a single step?

That's a pretty exciting thought.

Oh please, you are a kid until you are shitting yourself and can't even walk.

That might be true, but they only make out like bandits if that chain is successful, otherwise they can't really get anything for their coin.

Awesome news!  I literally just ordered a KeepKey today and Mycelium happens to be my preferred wallet on Android, so I'm pretty excited. :)

But it's still extremely volatile with no end in sight, so it's not as good as cash.  This could be eventually resolved with mass user adoption, but it's a chicken and egg scenario.
Again, I think that bitcoin has a bright future, but I do not get excited about already existing first world retailers adopting bitcoin anymore.  That's by no means a revolution, just a slight evolution.
I want to see OpenBazaar take off.  I want to see a decentralized Uber. Etc.  Uber as it is adopting wouldn't be a revolution, and neither would Amazon.  I'd enjoy seeing it but come on man, get real.  It won't make this break through.
