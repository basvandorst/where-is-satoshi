Bitcoin allows us to escape from this criminal mafia of oligarchs who owns the banking system and seeks to control every citizen of this world through it. So the future of Bitcoin is fundamentally tied to non-compliance. Now of course a traditional business (like an exchange) has to comply with existing laws. This is because a centralized organization can be shutdown by these fuckers at anytime. So compliance is key to Coinbase's digital currency future. However, it is certainly not key to the existence of Bitsquare. So Brian, while I understand you need to collaborate with these criminals to make a living, your attempt to drag everyone else in your fight is somewhat too crude to convince.

Chapter 5, page 116, Example 5-1. "A Script that calls the blockchain.info API to find the UTXO related to an address". I don't think there is much to change in the book. The script runs fine (modulo some syntax fine tuning for those running python3). The issue (as indicated by theymos) is just that Blockchain.info limits the request output to 250 utxos.

The state is corrupt. Cops and regulators are owned by the few oligarchs and their masonic networks who control the Fed (since 1913) as well as judges, politicians, secret services and global media. Bitcoin (just like the internet) is an opportunity for mankind to free itself from this mafia. These people certainly do not want Bitcoin to succeed as it is a major threat to them. I cannot see why anyone would want cops and law enforcement get involved in this. The state is the enemy. Anyone who has grasped the fundamental truth of 911 understands this.

Utterly outstanding video. I have found myself in the past not knowing whether I should trust Anonymous, wondering whether they were somehow controlled by the elite they claim to fight against. After this I must say they have my support and gratitude. They are totally spot on... 
Of course there are so many other ways in which the 1% are milking the 99% which the video could have touched upon. One is the continuous stream of frivolous wars around the globe which enrich those manufacturing weapons financed by taxpayers' money. Another is the banking system which allows commercial banks to increase the money supply out of thin air through banking loans. **Imagine if we had bitcoin as a national currency: A Bank would not be able to charge you interest on bitcoin that do not exist, simply by creating a 'bitcoin balance' on your account. They would need to actually posses the bitcoin they are lending**. By allowing banks to earn interest on newly created money supply, the 1% elite are enriching themselves while creating inflationary pressure and devaluing the currency (another form of taxation on the  99%). Yet the elite will have us believe that government themselves cannot indulge in money creation for fear of inflation, and should instead borrow from them, thus legitimizing the burden of income tax falling on the 99%. Imagine how much taxes could be reduced if governments alone could create money, instead of banks...

Money is power. The criminals in charge of the western world already control the Central banks, the banking system, governments, the global media and intelligent services. They have the power to tax you so the money goes straight back into their pockets via government contacts (weapons, health care, public infrastructure, etc). They have the power to tax you a second time via money creation and hyper-inflation of assets. They also have the power to control everything you do by forcing you to rely on the banking system. Any attempt to escape from this well-organized and systematic racketeering of the people by the rent-seeking oligarchy is deemed 'money laundering', and is illegal simply because it undermines their power.

The 911 coup proves the existence of a hidden power which controls secret services,  the political class and global media. This power is behind the federal  reserve act of 1913 and the assassination of JFK among other events. While Clinton is guaranteed to be an employee of this hidden mafia (she relies on their funding), there is a small chance that Trump (having made his own money) could actually be an honest politician. I personally do not think so, but I would still favor him over Clinton.
@_date: 2016-06-29 10:44:15
We are being ruled by criminals (responsible for 911) who have a monopoly of money creation since the federal reserve act of 1913. These people insist in KYC/AML to ensure control over the people. Bitcoin is a major threat to this criminal mafia. One of the reason bitcoin is not illegal today (beyond the technical challenge of implementing a ban) is the official pretense that the regime we live in is a democracy. Introducing BIP75 into bitcoin is a dangerous path allowing these crooks to introduce future legislation whereby ownership of bitcoin is illegal unless it is nominative, a request which will have been made technically possible with BIP75. 
Let us not forget that the US government made it illegal to own gold in 1934, a ban associated with a ten year prison sentence. It is only a matter of time when Bitcoin will be similarly attacked.

The criminal mafia of oligarchs which govern the western world fundamentally cares about two things: The continued ability to defraud tax-payers with direct taxation, as well as the ability to siphon wealth away from citizens indirectly via inflation and money printing (which requires a continued monopoly on money creation and supremacy of the central bank). **This is all about financial control** to ensure the milking of an enslaved population by the elite can go on. Officially, they will of course present their actions as made necessary by the threat of terrorism financing (aka money laundering). However, no one should be fooled by this: Islamic terrorism is a creation of intelligence services. Terrorists attacks are false flag attacks perpetrated for the very purpose of legitimizing legislation to ensure control over freedom.

A rate is always quoted on an annualized basis, regardless of the term of the loan. So this is an annual rate for an overnight loan. The actual interest paid will be something like Notional * 0.45 * DCF , where DCF (day-count-fraction) is a fraction of year corresponding to the loan term (typically 1/365 for 1 day, or 1/360, or 3/365 if this is a week end etc, the specifics of how DCF is calculated depends on the currency and type of loan)

Andreas if you read this, I love you, but I think you are mistaken on the question of nationhood: "artificial lines that you can't see from space that divide people for no other reason than to allow control". The global banking, media and political elite of his world aim at achieving control with a one world government and do everything they can to undermine nation states, precisely because they prevent them from obtaining total control. The creation of the EU, NAFTA, WTO, IMF, World Bank, NATO are all aimed at achieving more control over people not less. The preservation of nation states is the best way to prevent this slide toward a global dictatorship. There is no question that national politicians are totally corrupt and report faithfully to the world banking elite. However, by keeping separate borders, laws and constitutional frameworks, we stand the chance that some of the independent nations of this world may one day shake themselves off the yoke of this global mafia, and find new ways of protecting their citizens. I also regard myself as a citizen of the world, but I prefer to be governed by an independent nation state than by NATO.

Yes it does accept incoming connections.
However, I believe these inbound connections are from other tor nodes and they are pretty slow to establish themselves (maybe about 10 inbound connections after 24 hours). I do not know whether it is possible to set things up so as to allow connections from ipv4 or ipv6 nodes (I am guessing it is only a matter of changing the `onlynet` setting below)
in order for you to be set up, you can look at [bitseed]( but don't run the script they give you. Just read the script and understand what needs to be done. In essence, what needs to be done is explained on [this post]( of bitcoin stack exchange. 
Essentially what you need to do is:
1. Make sure you have tor running.
2. Add the following two lines to your config file `/etc/tor/torrc`:
    
     HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/bitcoin_service/
     HiddenServicePort 8333 127.0.0.1:8333
3. restart your tor service
4. Read the address of your hidden tor service from `/var/lib/tor/bitcoin-service/hostname`
5. Finally add the following lines to your `bitcoin.conf` file:
    
     onlynet=onion
     onion=127.0.0.1:9050
     listen=1
     bind=127.0.0.1:8333

     seednode=xqzfakpeuvrobvpj.onion
     seednode=tsyvzsqwa2kkf6b2.onion
     banscore=10000
     bantime=11
If you want to select other seed nodes, you may wish to have a look at [this page]( Note that with these settings you can have your firewall block **all** incoming connections. You do not need to have any port open. In fact, this even works through a VPN

Building from source ensures the binaries are tied to the source. Whether or not you have reviewed the source, this removes the possible risk of downloading binaries which somehow have been tempered with. Granted you can authenticate the binaries alone, and this goes a long way towards achieving security. But making sure the binaries are tied to the source is arguably even safer (the hope is some people have reviewed the source, you do not want to use binaries which deviate from the source). So all things being equal, it seems to me that building from source is more secure than simply downloading (authenticated) binaries.

Banks are not simply trying to stay in business. Behind the banks, there is an oligarchy which exercises a tremendous amount of political and financial control via the banking system.

Every activity outside that banking system is essentially black-market, as government has no control over it. We already have a thriving black-market thanks to cash. The one thing that has not happened yet is the total disappearance of cash. However, when this happens I cannot see why a landlord who would be happy to accept cash today (and not declare anything), would not be happy to accept bitcoins tomorrow. It is true that bitcoin does not (yet) offer the same anonymity guarantees as cash. But this may change as the protocol evolves, or the use of some side-chains may bring about improved anonymity. In many other ways, bitcoin is far superior to cash: it is a lot easier and safer to hide, inflation-resistant, internationally accepted, and you can easily take a flight with it to any destination in the world. Your concern (I think) is that because cash is seemingly 'fungible with the banking system' and 'legal', we need cash in order to bring bitcoin into this system. But it is an illusion to believe that cash is fungible. The regulations in place are such that cash is no longer accepted by the banking system. Sure you can deposit $100 into your bank account. But you cannot use $1m in cash, nor can you pay your taxes with it. Cash is already a separate currency with its own economy, and bitcoin offers better characteristics than cash. So while I completely agree that cash is a very good thing for the freedom of mankind and the integration of bitcoins, I personally do not despair: if our corrupt masters want to deprive us of cash, we shall keep going with bitcoins. Fuck 'em :)

People have not yet realized they have the option to escape from banks and governments. As they gradually wake up to that fact, the value of bitcoin will rise to levels which are unthinkable today. The service bitcoin provides is priceless. It fulfills a fundamental need for mankind, that of being free from racketeering by the rich and powerful elite (which controls governments). So I think one should not worry about not having invested earlier.

Yes, once cash has disappeared and we are compelled to use government approved crypto-currencies, converting bitcoin into fiat will become very difficult. However, we can easily imagine a situation by then where 'spending bitcoin' no longer requires it to be converted back into fiat: there will be many people happy to exchange goods and services directly for bitcoin, outside the jurisdiction of any government, as a sort of 'black' economy.

Great Video! The Federal Reserve act of 1913 was the hand over by corrupt politicians of the power to issue currency to a cartel of private bankers. This has allowed a mafia of oligarchs to impose additional taxation on the people through currency debasement. It has given them the power to fund wars and pursue their imperialistic agenda, killing millions around the world. Bitcoin has the potential to take away this power. It is a major threat to the crooks who govern us.
@_date: 2016-12-24 15:06:51
This is another good point: the new world order dictatorship can indeed go beyond eliminating cash: It can ensure that the ownership of a wide range of goods are controlled by 'registers', thus making bitcoin impossible to use for a transaction. However, this is already happening e.g. for homes and commercial properties. Ok so you can't buy a home with bitcoin (nor can you with cash), fine. You can still pay a rent. Financial freedom is certainly enhanced with cash. But if cash disappears then bitcoin can replace it.

The oligarchs not only own the banks, but also control politicians: they finance their electoral campaigns and own the newspapers and TV channels which decide whether an election is won or lost. They also control various masonic networks, secret societies and elitist clubs to which every meaningful politician belongs. There is one thing politicians are repeatedly ordered to do, namely defraud taxpayers to 'rescue' the banks (allegedly 'too big to fail'). So our taxes go straight into the oligarchs' pockets.

I accept both points.

Until such time when new democratic institutions can be devised which are immune to corruption by the richest, there is not much hope of a better form of government.

Tax only applies to those who submit themselves to KYC procedures or use the banking system to handle their fiat transfers. This is fine if you want to benefit from the convenience of slick trading platforms which you get from an organized exchange. 
But it need not be this way. 
Yes it is a hassle to buy bitcoin anonymously from total strangers using cash. However, it is a hassle which allows you to create a totally untraceable bitcoin saving pot which no one will ever take away from you, not even through taxation.
Once you have untraceable bitcoin, there are many platforms allowing you to trade crypto-to-crypto and which do not require any form of KYC.

Yes it matters a great deal: governments have made gold illegal in the past (e.g U.S. in 1934) and bitcoin represents a huge threat to the central bankers (who control our politicians and the global media shaping public opinion). So the possibility of bitcoin being criminalized (in the name of the 'war on terror' or fight against money laundering and/or 'ransomware') is very real.

If BIP-148 UASF is the way forward, why doesn't core release an 14.2 version with UASF as an optional feature at least?

These 'enemies' are powerless. The biggest political enemy of bitcoin is the Rothschild led banking mafia which totally controls our so called 'democratic' institutions (our politicians, our media, our intelligent services, our judges etc). Their official ideology is democracy, free markets, human rights, the rule of law etc. while they covertly finance and instigate wars and regime change across the globe (which they justify with false flag terrorist attacks), bringing misery to millions of people.

Those who think this is fiction (or at best only applicable to bitcoin) should take a peek inside the rabbit hole and watch the [Architects and Engineers on 911]( documentary. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 13:45:32
The establishment will use every possible mean (including comedy) to control public opinion and associate bitcoin with illegal activities. A war is coming and in order to justify future legislation which will criminalize various aspects of bitcoin dealings, the governing mafia needs the minds of the public to have been  adequately brainwashed, just like we have been brainwashed on the 'war on terror' following he false flag attack of 911. 
@_date: 2016-07-28 15:44:26
It seems to me the most important thing you need to do right now is understand the truth of 911. There is not much point attempting to grasp who rules the world, until you have convinced yourself that 911 is a crime committed by elements of the state. The best introduction I know about this is Massumo Mazzucco 5 hours documentary "The new Pearl Harbor".

The evidence of controlled demolition (which I have indicated) is overwhelming and in plain sight. So the odds are Julian Assange is aware of this evidence but chooses to ignore it. Why? It may be that he worries about an ensuing credibility loss as the public is not prepared to face this fact. Or it may be that he follows orders from people above him. The same can be said of Chomsky who cannot be trusted for the same reason.
@_date: 2016-07-20 09:24:08
This is very helpful thank you. The real issue I had was that when calling:
and subsequently:
`bc::ec_point public_key = bc::secret_to_public(secret);`
`std::cout &lt;&lt; bc::encode_hex(public_key) &lt;&lt; std::endl;`
I was not getting the right public key it seems (I was getting a public key which corresponded to the reverse endianness in the input) compared with pycoin utility:
`$ ku -j 0381090..14776`
having replaced `decode_hash` by `decode_base16`, I am now getting the right answer :)

Those among us who hodl bitcoin without awareness of how corrupt our financial system is are hodling bitcoin for the wrong reasons. So what you may ask? Well the only reasons a handful of oligarchs are able to control the money creation process in most of the world, is because of the people's ignorance of the truth. Without this ignorance, people would take no part in fiat currencies controlled by a few men. So if all you care if making a profit off bitcoin's success, you have everything to gain by dispelling the general state ignorance, and this starts with yourself.

If a custom official at some random airport arbitrarily seizes my coins, have I lost everything? Has the bearer of the coin full access to the private key? Is there any form of safeguard against loss or theft (as there would be I assume for a hardware wallet)?
@_date: 2017-06-07 04:31:35




Gold a "reasonably reliable store of value"... ahah... while paper currencies have always ended up worthless in history...
The only reason fiat currency is promoted by the media is that the "printing press" is owned by a handful of very rich men who can now afford to buy anything they want: our politicians, our judges, our intelligent services, and our media.

In my opinion, financial theory, the current financial system, its history, the controlling banking cartel, etc. have everything to do with bitcoin: it may not explain the protocol itself, but it certainly explains its purpose.

I wanted to invest a little in Monero so I built the client from source. However, the unit test was failing and the devs casually explained I should just ignore the tests... I don't like running something (including a crypto wallet) on my machine unless the tests suite comes back successfully, as is the case for bitcoin and litecoin core. So I wish Monero devs would release software with proper tests...

Thank you ! your interpretation seems reasonable and I cannot argue against it. It would be interesting if someone else (with legal background) would disagree with this.
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:24:25
Very good point it seems. However, is it not fair to say that the states are using Federal Reserve notes (rather than gold or silver) 'in Payment of Debt', e.g. when paying state employee salaries?
@_date: 2017-06-13 14:06:37
I have just decided to stop buying now: why?
Simply because whatever new fiat I can afford to invest in bitcoin makes little difference to the existing position.
@_date: 2017-06-16 04:25:23
The Federal Reserve is not run by unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats. It is run by a handful of billionaires who covertly employ these bureaucrats. Furthermore, elected politicians are themselves employees of these same billionaires, who control the financing of the political campaigns, as well as individual promotions via the global media. **So yes handing over the power of money creation to a cartel of private bankers** is a huge scam, but it would be foolish to assume the people will be adequately served by elected politicians. What we need is a financial system which cannot be corrupted by money itself. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 18:39:19
If non-negligible hash-power can be gathered in favor of bip148, while easing difficulty adjustment is a legitimate concern, isn't equally important to display such hash-power so as to boost bip148's credibility and encourage others to follow?
@_date: 2017-06-17 17:47:38
While I totally share your concern on mining concentration and your support of UASF, I think you should spare us from the 'Chinese government dictatorship' rhetoric, as the US government is [totally controlled by the banking mafia]( and has committed [unspeakable crimes]( If you think the western world is not a dictatorship, you should seriously think again. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 14:45:03
The governing mafia (which owns the Fed) simply takes the money whenever it is needed. Donald Rumsfeld conceded the day before 911 that [2.3 trillions were unaccounted for](
@_date: 2017-06-13 06:01:47
Damn, I did:
    $ git clone git://github.com/UASF/bitcoin
    $ cd bitcoin
    $ git tag
I looked for the latest tag, then:

For those who still do not understand that the financial elite which control the US government (and other western governments) are a criminal organization (via the use of intelligent services), see the [testimony of senior banker Ronald Bernard]( (18:00)
@_date: 2016-07-28 14:47:20
Great video, thank you! It should be noted that this financial elite not only has a monopoly on money creation, they also control governments, media, masonic networks and most importantly secret services which they repeatedly use to carry out false flag terrorist attacks (e.g. 911) or summary executions (e.g. Kennedy, Luther King). They are the plague of the western world.
@_date: 2017-06-01 13:38:47
Luckily, their strategy is irrelevant. This is the point of bitcoin: private property is no longer subject to the racketeering of the state, orchestrated to finance false flag terrorist attacks and bogus wars in the middle east, so the billionaires can enrich themselves with weapon sales (among other scams to the taxpayers).  But of course, some of you are using exchanges with KYC. Good luck with that.

Would an open source version of Jaxx make the occurrence of such vulnerability less likely (as design mistakes would be highlighted very quickly by the community)?

For those who miss the point let me explain: QE stands for 'quantitative easing' which is the process carried out by a central bank of creating new money out of nowhere (i.e. tweak a few numbers in a computer system) and buy securities (IOU's issued by governments) on the market with this newly created money. What is the impact of QE? It creates a price inflation of assets, with a ripple effect into other asset classes such as shares and properties. Who owns these assets? Overwhelming the financial elite. **Hence QE is equivalent to a distribution of free cash to the super rich. The power of money creation, should be used (if at all) for the benefit of all citizens, not just for the top 1%.** The people are just getting screwed by this system. Not only are they not getting any benefit from this cash distribution, but the inflation of asset prices means the value of their labor is being totally slashed as they can no longer afford to buy assets themselves. **Hence another way to look at  QE is as a  theft of labor from those who work**.

Let us not forget that US bankers were financing the [bolshevik revolution]( in 1917 as well as [Hitler's national socialist party]( a few years after that. This is well documented  by the works of [Anthony C. Sutton](

Why doesn't the media cover [this]( ? The corruption is not specific to US I think: the same handful of billionaires control the totality of the western world (banks, corporations, media, intelligence services, politicians, judges, etc).

The governing mafia creates a heavily regulated banking system which effectively gives them a monopoly on all banking operations. They then proceed to siphon out hard-earned cash from millions of people with negative interest rates.   
@_date: 2017-06-02 15:24:16
The [state crime of 911]( demonstrates the failure of democratic institutions, as they are known today. The challenge facing mankind is to invent new types of institutions (protocols) which guarantee the fundamental freedoms of citizens, without the possibility of corruption by the financial elite. For example, we now have bitcoin which has the potential of reversing the corruption of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 (where the fundamental powers of money creation were transferred from the state to a cartel of private bankers)... Hopefully, other inventions will come along, which will bring back power and freedom to the people, away from the criminal oligarchs who rule them.
