Perhaps I am too naive, but if I understand my CS correctly, the only thing that is missing in the existing opcodes is a conditional branch instruction ?
Skimming over the interpreter code here:
There's a big iteration loop over the script that proceeds in sequence over the different values of pc (the program counter). Adding an opcode that resets the program counter within the same script yields a full-on general-purpose computing environment. 
So in general, Forth has looping constructs, and it's trivial to add support for such a construct to the existing bitcoin code.
A general question, though, is: Does anyone have an example of a desirable bitcoin script that can't be realized with the existing opcodes? At the moment it's hard for me to construct examples for something that can't be done in the existing language - the limiting factor seems to be less the absence of loops but rather the limit to 201 ops per script?

TOALTSTACK / FROMALTSTACK
There is a double stack; Turing-completeness may not be there, but AFAIK he only claimed that you can do loops with bitcoin script?

Not saying he is the real deal, and as long as the program counter in scripts only advances linearly through the script you won't have Turing completeness - but it's a good question whether you actually *need* Turing completeness and what scripts are desirable but not implementable in the current code :)
