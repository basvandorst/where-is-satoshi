this is the conclusion i have kind of come to.. i think i will buy in a little now.. and keep my eye and if i see a drop i will buy in more

i just sold my 2000$ of stock and want to get in with the little bit of money im comfortable losing.... should i buy in *bit by bit* or is it time to get in? should i wait till/if it goes down to like 600 or 700?

im not interesteed in quick profits, but a long term investment.. i was going to buy in slowly and hold it for 20-30 years
@_date: 2014-01-05 16:37:33
i think this is what i will do.. buy 500-1000$ worth now and keep watching.. this is my little bit of money that im comfortable losing
