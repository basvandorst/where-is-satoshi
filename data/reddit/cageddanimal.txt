I understand the down votes but I laughed.

I have plans to use my raspberry pi to run my asic.

Not sure why that was necessary to say.  Of course there are.

From wikipedia (unless its wrong I couldn't find anything to suggest it is).
Dubstep rhythms are usually syncopated, and often shuffled or incorporating tuplets. The tempo is nearly always in the range of 138–142 beats per minute, with a clap or snare usually inserted every third beat in a bar.[12] In its early stages, dubstep was often more percussive, with more influences from 2‑step drum patterns. A lot of producers were also experimenting with tribal drum samples, such as Loefah's early release "Truly Dread" and Mala's "Anti-War Dub".

I bought one a few weeks ago.  Easy and fast.  Would recommend.

Where do you get that chart?

Anyone have any proof that they are honoring original GH/S purchases for preorders?  I couldn't find any announcement like that.

For some reason it doesn't surprise me that ~~dubstep~~ artists would be one of the first to adopt bitcoin.
Edit:  Electro House not dubstep.  I stand corrected.  The knife party tracks I've heard certainly sounded like dubstep.  Maybe they were remixes?

That should do it.

Don't run bitcoin on a vm with a wallet that you have not backed up.

Love bitcoins.  Hate that guy.   I really don't want him to be the spokesperson for bitcoins.  I get a serious used car salesmen vibe from him.

Am I in the minority here that I don't want to know who he/she/they are?  One person should not have such a large influence on the direction of the bitcoin protocol.  Additionally what if Satoshi turned out to be a crack pot?  That would unjustifiably discredit the validity of bitcoin.

Same thing I did.  I bought at 3.30 and 5.70.  My mtgox account was inactivated and I had to file a help ticket to get it reactivated.  They got me back up and running in 24 hours and after it was reactivated the reset password worked. I even found 9 BTC I left on the account!

Mike's time is Mike's.  If you have to ask permission then it is still Google's time.  That being said I still think Google will support it eventually.

When will you guys have an api hooked into testnet up and running?
