I bought 2.3 Bitcoin at 7k and finally pussied out after going from 13k to 11. Don't regret it because I'm still positive, but if you can take profits and buy back a bigger chunk after it tanks a little, why not.

I just sold my Bitcoin after losing 6k since Friday, call me a pussy but I'll wait this falling wedge out and buy back a bigger chunk.

I would freak out but not in the way you think. I would buy 10 Bitcoin without a second thought.

so im not new to bitcoin, but im pretty new to reading charts, i know my plots are super messy but ive been watching  the big rising channel (yellow dotted), is that a well calculated plot ? or just a guess

Long story short, people HODL in hopes that what ever they're holding will be worth much much more down the road. Example, buying Bitcoin for pennies back in the day, HODL, sell bitcoin for thousands today.

@_date: 2019-05-17 03:37:11

Everyone wants a piece of the pie, ASAP. so much that only few take the time to polish their platform.
