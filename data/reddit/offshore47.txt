You will make some profit for now until the block rewards get cut in half again then it will be little to no profit.

I’m hoping the price increases tenfold for you with bitcoin!

Lots of used ones selling on eBay because it is in fact hard to make a profit anymore.  You also have to take into consideration waiting for blocks to mine and network issues.  The calculators tell you based on 24 hours a day 7 days a week with 0 issues....you can figure at least 10% minimum down time per month.  Then electrical costs depending where you are, then you won’t get the Hashes they say it will do unless you keep them well within temperature range... lots of variables!  
I wish you luck in your endeavor!

The equipment cost to mine it at today’s price is around 2500.00 USD and that’s just to make a very small profit of pennies per day.  That will become unprofitable in about 3 months or so!

Yes that’s true, however, bitcoin has its issues and will continue to have issues.  It takes a good bit of time for transactions to process, they have forked a few times and I suspect more hard-forks coming, there are other coins with better speed, Security, less ability for tracing, etc.  I’m thinking a few other coins will bypass bitcoin eventually.  If you get 911 days at this level and yes it will be much harder and less productive mining as time goes by, I’m thinking you will be able to get equipment cost back and some good profit.  
Amazing that currency not backed by anything can be worth so much!  It’s no different than the rest of the fiat currency we already have!  Governments want to be able to get money out of it as well!
