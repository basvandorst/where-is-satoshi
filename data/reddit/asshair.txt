The utility of bitcoin is it's ability to store value. 
If you wanna actually make crypto transactions in a reasonable way then Ethereum is your answer.

Oh shit the government did Lincoln too? I didn't know people were smart enough to conspire back then.

I don't understand how a commodity that's guided by infinite scarcity isn't like the textbook definition of a bubble and also kind of pyramidy.

This is a fake/shill account everybody.

Can you tl;dr your book in a Reddit comment for me?

Okay but which one do I buy/HODL?

Just like what every investor does, nobody's doing this from the goodness of their hearts for some technologically principaled purpose. And if the tech needs new an expanded userbase to be valuable to that userbase, and the only reason people adopt the tech is for value, then it seems like one big circle-jerk waiting to collapse. 
Why would the average joe fiat via btc other than for speculation or drugs, is what it comes down to. Is the average joe really that aware or passionate about the societal benefits of a de-centralized currency?

No, the price increases as time goes on due to increased demand I believe.

If a market's biggest main is increasing value, and new users are needed to increase that value, then we have a fundamentally speculative currency on our hands. Which is almost inherently worthless.
I think.
