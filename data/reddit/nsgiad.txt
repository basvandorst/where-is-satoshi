I think there is a difference between instability and volatile. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 03:56:16
You didn't read the article, did you?

This might be the most exciting online store news to date. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 08:02:59
Does blockchain have a link to the site tho? If not then it's like buying a product online only to get scammed and then being pissed at your bank for them letting you spend your money. 
@_date: 2014-09-05 21:46:00
I'm guessing because the OP didn't move 10k of money, but bitcoins worth 10k. There should be a difference, but unfortunately there doesn't seem to be for a company that wants to do business within the US.
@_date: 2014-04-13 00:03:59
2.4 to be precise. 
@_date: 2014-01-22 06:26:44
Haha wow. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 00:31:06
mind blown. Thanks for the link!
@_date: 2014-01-06 08:07:08
I just contacted them via reddit and they whitelisted my account until I made level 2 
@_date: 2014-01-09 08:43:33
Usually, yep. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 20:16:34
half life 3?
@_date: 2014-01-15 17:27:06
Yeah, I don't shop at overstock....like ever. But I get my contacts and glasses from coastal, have for years.

Coinbase fees are based on the amount of coins you're buying. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 00:38:11
Or toilet paper 
@_date: 2014-03-25 17:43:32
check out the hook while my DJ revolves it?
@_date: 2014-01-06 08:19:50
Those coinbase issues only exist until you're a level two. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 03:28:04
Google denies the OP's claim 
@_date: 2014-01-09 08:40:51
Yes it would still be illegal. Bitcoins have value, therefore you are exchanging something of value for sex. Even if you traded a chicken, that would still be illegal. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 08:27:18
Ahh well played, thanks I never realized they had a link to it. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 00:57:39
I loled. Thanks @_date: 2014-04-01 21:16:52
I'm not on the list and it is not a unique email address for coinbase.
@_date: 2014-01-30 13:41:57
Now this thread is complete. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 22:16:44
Buy from coinbase and send them to another wallet, like blockchain or something. Then sell from there as coinbase would have no way to know what you're doing with your coins. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:54:07
This would be great, but the problem with credit cards is a charge back. Debit cards might be better because they are rarely protected like a CC, but I still imagine it's quite problematic. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:01:33
Usually just emailing support will put you on their whitelist, especially if this isn't your first transaction with them. 
@_date: 2013-09-04 19:42:07
Contact them via either their website or on here. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:23:03
Shared risk would be great, but when you have a decentralized currency these are the kinds of issues you run into. Coinbase can do a direct transfer from a Wells Fargo (and maybe BofA not sure on that) account. The problem is that when I bought it took 4.5 days to get my coins. Luckily the price kept rising so I wasn't upset, but if I had bought in at say 150 and in 5 days it's at 25, I'm not gonna be terribly happy. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:45:46
only computers use Muslims?
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:43:43
This is just a form of confirmation bias. How many people buy btcs when they think the price is going to decrease? Yeah probably not many, therefore most will buy when they think the price will increase, and historically (minus a time here and there like in April and the day after SR fell) you can buy a bitcoin and be pretty sure the price will be higher when you get it. Therefore, when a transaction is deemed high risk it must be because coinbase doesn't wanna lose money on the deal, so you remember that time they "fucked" you. I've had one transaction cancelled before I was verified, I just emailed them and had my transaction back, at the original purchase price, within a day. Occam's razor here people, is it a huge fraudulent practice at a national (international) level? Or just a (possibly poorly) programed parameter in the website.  
@_date: 2013-10-30 17:32:06
Turn us into the browncoats eh?
@_date: 2013-11-14 14:58:00
Still there, for level 2, this is for level 1
@_date: 2013-12-30 08:09:51
Looks good, hopefully the price will update more smoothly now. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 04:36:15
They're all thieves tho, just depends on what type of lie you like to be told. 
@_date: 2013-08-30 19:46:12
I use them to manages my domains, they're solid. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 08:58:49
Your idea is bad and you should feel bad. 
@_date: 2013-03-25 23:13:29
Yeah I would like to actually you know, buy some bitcoins instead of being told to wait a magical amount of time till I might be able to buy some again.
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:19:27
Paypal, among other reasons, isn't good because of the chargeback possibility as well. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 20:44:41
I think that's the quick and dirty way to look at it, yeah. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 06:07:25
Why? Buying bitcoins is legal. Do you not store card info on Amazon or any other merchant site? 
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:21:46
only fair ones tho. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 18:20:21
Yep, it's possible, albeit unlikely. All depends how careful you are and what your habits tend to be. If you're investing a large some then a cold storage wallet or paper wallet is a better idea.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:03:00
Oh trust me, I really wish grades could be assigned like you say, but that's just not the reality anymore. Students theses day have this expectation that is basically "I paid for this class, give me an A". They have this sense of entitlement where they think they set the grades for a class. "I'm an A student, I should not be getting a C in here" That's not how it works kids. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 01:28:40
comments from bitter and depressed people. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 23:37:16
Thanks, I'll look into this so I can have alternative methods.
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:19:35
Ahh got it, thanks!
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:53:32
I was replying to samskiter so my post was based on what I assumed to be some type of grading on z-scores/percentiles. This reply is based on that, so if this has just been a huge misunderstanding then at least we can recognize that. 
Grading on z-scores is a great way, at least in graduate school, to make sure only the truly best move on and graduate with a degree from that institution. When starting grad school there are always those A students from undergrad that just can not compete at the graduate level and then you have the ones that get to grad school and completely crush it. If you are in a class where a 98% and up is an A and a 95% is a C then you know you have some really smart kids in your class. Do this in every class for a program and you know that only the smartest students were able to earn a degree. Short of just getting rid of grades, this is the only way to stop the inflation of college degrees.

This does Android users no good, not to mention the huge fees.
@_date: 2013-11-16 22:46:56
I would say 10 cents is pretty darn close to a free sample. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 22:47:08
Yeah that's my gripe is that they let me know today, the day it was supposed to go through. I've been waiting all week, watching the price go up, had I known, I could have used another method. 
Thanks for the tip, I didn't like that dwolla wanted my SSN however. Using your method can I make purchases without leaving my house? That's what I liked about coinbase is that I can use my wells fargo account. I don't mind waiting 4 days, as long as they honor the damn sale. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 09:00:07
In the US this is the easiest way. 
@_date: 2013-08-04 21:21:39
I had a question that was like "how long have you been associated with the address at [address I lived at for 3 years, over 3 years ago] and the correct answer was 5 or more years since technically I have known about that address for that long. Oddly worded for sure, keep that in mind when trying to answer your questions. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:46:21
This is basically graded based on z-scores and I think it's brilliant. It's unfortunate that the only time to tend to ever see anything close to this is in some graduate programs. 
@_date: 2013-09-04 19:50:14
have you contacted on here? He has helped me in the past. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 04:43:02
As long as it's not a straw purchase, in states where that's illegal. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 17:40:11
It's a risk vs. reward vs. anonymity equation that only you can answer. At current, there is nothing illegal about the purchase or selling of bitcoins (other than possible tax issues, but we'll see) and the adoption rate by businesses both in person an online is quite high, not to mention speculators, so there is nothing inherently suspicious with buying them either. 
From coinbase, you can tumble your coins in multiple ways that will make tracking them back to you very difficult with a minimum fee. After that, spend them how you will with a reasonably high level of anonymity.
Now if you want to true anonymity, then you're looking at using localbitcoins or similar services that deal with cash payment/deposits which may (I said may) be more risky (more likely of scams) and may be more expensive (coinbase is pretty much selling at the market rate, localbitcoins, at least in my area are a good deal above that. 
So it's up to you, I'm a level 2 instant purchaser with coinbase, this keeps me from losing my ass incase the price drops in the few days a regular transfer would take.   
@_date: 2013-10-15 09:20:13
As soon as they stop requiring a credit card to regain instant purchases I'll consider it. Or at least allow visa backed debit cards. What's up with this new "beta" credit card thing. You already have all my banking information, you know how to find me. I was a level 2 with instant purchase power, now I can no longer do this. Features that remove convenience are not features. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:07:05
I like turtles.
@_date: 2013-12-29 02:29:48
Not sure what's worse, having a website openly steal or reading a line like this. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:54:52
I saw this and belly laughed at work. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 09:15:37
Better than it was, it's a start man! 
@_date: 2013-04-25 17:26:54
mmmm free range, organic magic beans.
@_date: 2013-12-29 19:41:44
Oh, if they're being honest about a mess up yeah, I want disclosure not silence. However, I have no reason to trust that anyone running any of these sites are honest people, nor should anyone else. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 22:19:55
Fred, 
I just PMed you about my issue as well. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 21:44:03
I don't understand the point of this. I can do this at home already, without ever having to step foot in a mall, which my sanity greatly appreciates. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:51:42
You can do criminal activity with cash too. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 05:06:35
Wow that's pretty crazy. My information is quite out of date as I had this issue back in May or so. I have yet to have an issue since being a level 2 buyer however. Fred fixed me up when I had issues as a level 1. Sorry to hear about your issues, maybe I was just lucky that it happened back a while ago and hit level 2 since then. I've been doing quite a bit of instant buying the last few days with no issues. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:05:25
Incorrect, visa debit cards now work. 
source: that's what I use
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:03:40
Yep, you nailed it. 
@_date: 2013-08-28 20:19:03
I would but I still buy the occasional items from ebay
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:49:34
I think I'm having a low functioning day, how do you use popmoney to buy bitcoins with credit cards?
@_date: 2013-08-05 01:35:54
Oh wow, that's insane. For something like that you would have to look at the county property tax records I would imagine. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 09:40:42
Close, I'd go with availability heuristic. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:52:28
Well when you put it like that, I can see how simple it really is!
@_date: 2013-08-27 05:21:23
When you consider the DEA is dealing with drug seizures that add up into the billions, I don't really see how this is a concern. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:47:48
Because the only thing people with money like is even more money. Greed runs it all. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:57:28
Same here, they added it a few days after they started the cc thing. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 11:12:08
Hide from whom? That's the question and really the answer as well. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 22:15:33
They just hosed me today. It was my second purchase from them, it was for 2 btc (same as my first) at 66, well wouldn't you know, they cancelled it for being "high risk" now that btc is at 120. Looks like they are losing my future business. 
EDIT: I contacted Fred and my original transaction is now pending again. Thanks again Fred.
@_date: 2013-12-24 21:41:26
So they hacked your gmail, btcee account, and intercepted your text messages? That's a pretty damn big security breach for someone to just randomly pull on you. Was log in info for everything on your phone? If so then there must be something malicious running on your phone. 
@_date: 2013-07-28 21:40:16
I believe CB sets their prices based on the average price of the major exchanges. 
@_date: 2013-09-05 19:54:58
Can someone explain to me how this is possible considering that SR tumbles your coins before adding to your account? I guess the tumbling doesn't help as much as some think. The key is still, LE has to be onto you and get your public key first. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 22:28:23
Since your text messaging was compromised I would think it has something to do with jailbreaking, but I'm not up to speed on how it is done these days so hopefully someone more knowledgable can chime in. If this wasn't a targeted attack at you, then this could turn into a pretty big chain of btc stealing. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 19:59:14
and then download a 2FA app for your phone. I would guess the coinbase  app has this built in, but the app Authy is an android 2FA app as well. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:56:17
Oops, yep my bad, I mixed that up, thanks for correcting my drunken gun ramblings!
@_date: 2013-08-30 17:58:34
I had a similar thing happen with my second purchase, it was canceled for being "high risk", I contacted one of their reps on here and BAM, back in business. 
I will continue to give them my business. 
@_date: 2013-10-15 03:07:16
Second title way more accurate. I was just about to purchase some coins when I noticed that crap, awesome, back to waiting 5 days for my coins.
@_date: 2013-10-15 03:06:36
Has to be a credit card as well, my visa backed wells fargo debit card did not work. So now coinbase is back to like when I was a level 1, I emailed them to tell them my opinion on the matter. I know a few of their employee's on on here, perhaps contacting them as well may help get rid of this new "feature"
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:05:38
Visa credit and debit cards only for now.
