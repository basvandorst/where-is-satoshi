this energy consumption is minuscule compared to bitcoin


these have nothing to do with the transactions itself. These are optional services around these transactions... 
Bitcoin will need escrow and fraud prevention systems as well when it ever wants to go mainstream and these have to be put on top of an already pretty (energy) inefficient system 
A decentralized database that needs a lot of cryptographic security will always be way more inefficient compared to a centralized database that doesn't need to "mine" hashes...


the thing is the energy consumption scales with prices. If bitcoin would reach 1M per coin then every block would earn miners 25 million $ and would cause a ridiculous amount of hashing power allocated to mining... 
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:30:33
it's actually the opposite way around.

if the faucet is over and the coins got distributed then there is no centralization.

@_date: 2018-01-18 10:56:16
yeah sure but still... bitcoin is almost 10 years old and is still completely useless. You cant do anything with it anymore.

but retailers won't be able to build trust in the first place. I would never buy anything from a new or tiny shop with no option for a chargeback... doing so is literally asking to get scammed


the DNM is full of exit scams and only work that way because there is no DNM amazon.


most of them are astroturfed... there are companies doing that for you. Only a fool would believe comments made on Amazon or any other site.


the only thing I can do is to write a mean comment that can as well be buried under hundreds of paid reviews... has been done in the past and is still the normal case across the internet.


but they do. I got locked up my funds when I was on both sides.
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:17:16
coinbase does. The rest are probably still struggling with the users that registered and wanted to be verified in December.
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:00:27
it hasn't really rebound since December...
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:37:57


but thats a big part of what credit card companies do and crypto will have to do aswell if it ever wants to be accepted on a bigger scale.

the WWW protocol got introduced around 1990. The first graphical browser was introduced in 1993 and the internet was already pretty mainstream in 1999.

yeah, but at some point, you would have to beat physics.

@_date: 2018-01-26 10:03:32
if some low volume futures can crash bitcoin every time they expire you could as well just sell everything now...
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:38:29


you cant just throw blockchain at every problem and think it will just solve it... that's the dotcom bubble all over again. Cryptographical protected and decentralized blockchains are extremely inefficient in storing and sending information and a centralized solution may be more efficient in alot areas.


yeah and the EU showed that it's **TECHNICALLY** possible to transfer money across the country border with 0 costs for the consumer.
The reason why it's not happening across the globe are political or economic ones like protectionism. Bitcoin won't change that.


there is no human interaction with a wire transaction... it's all automated including auditing and fraud prevention.


Bitcoin is now almost 10 years old and has almost no adoption... in comparison, the WWW protocol got introduced around 1990, the first graphical web browser was released 1993 and the internet was pretty much mainstream in 2000.

that's not supported everywhere.
Also what if the product is broken? or the wrong item was shipped? or an empty package and so on...


what has bitcoin achieved in the past years except for a price rise? every bigger company has dropped it as a payment option and the dark ned market dropped it as well. The tech behind bitcoin is developing extremely slow ... segwit took 1 year to implement and still not used by 90% of all transactions.

are you aware that the "current system that favors the consumer" helps you to realize a lot of your sales? If I couldn't chargeback my money or cant use some escrow like PayPal I would never buy anything from some small internet stores and would just go straight to Amazon... there is just way too much scamming out there.

no, it's not free. A decentralized database will never be as efficient as a centralized one... that's physics.
* there would be some serious infrastructure in need to handle like 5k tx/per second someone has to pay.
* people won't tie up their own money in order to route other people money for free.
* LN offers no escrow system so you will need a 3rd party anyways for that will charge % of the price
* Businesses still want fiat and would also need a 3rd party that turns the coins into fiat for a % of the price aswell.

there never were a lot of companies in the first place. There is almost no bigger business that directly accepts bitcoin and that one who does only accept fiat through bitpay or coinbase... and bitpay basically dropped bitcoin as well.
Noone uses bitrefill
I own websites with 5 times that traffic no one uses lol
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:05:00
the question should be "why is it so high" considering that bitcoin lost almost all of its use cases and is basically just a gamble if LN ever brings back some adoption for bitcoin or not.
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:55:46
and how would bitcoin be helpful here? 
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:38:16

@_date: 2018-01-28 20:11:36


and you think that crypto won't have to adhere to, local laws on both sites, taxes to be considered, tariffs and be properly reported? that's just another layer crypto needs to ever have able to become mainstream otherwise there won't be any places you can buy anything with bitcoin.


Technically you could... you can do it within Europe without problems and any cost. It's just the layers that were put into place like preventing money laundering and so on. Bitcoin doesn't prevent money laundering and actually supports it making addition solutions even more expensive.  You don't understand the world if you think bitcoin would ever be mainstream if circumvents every law that was put in place by the people to protect their interests.

@_date: 2018-01-28 19:25:27
1. its already pretty hard for new and small merchants to compete with Amazon. Building up trust and a name can be pretty hard if there are already trusted alternatives... I would NEVER pay someone in crypto I don't trust, never ever, but I would buy some stuff I cant get on Amazon on some small indie site with PayPal. It's also pretty rare that someone will go to court for a 50$ item... I was in that situation myself and I had to just take my loss.
2. Look the darnetmarket reddit. It's full of "beware of XY" and "XY is exit scamming"
3. year, is pretty easy to spot and I see it almost everywhere nowadays... you can also manipulate successful transactions as much as you want like people did on ebay years ago.
4. see 1.
you say that they do nothing but that's simply not true. If a CC company or Paypal just wants to transfer value from person A to B and nothing else they could just set up a simple server where it automatically gets settled in a SQL database and people just need to withdraw their money... that would cost like 0.0000001 cents per transaction while crypto basically doing that in a decentralized way with x1000000 times the cost with massive scaling issues. If you want the same service and security like the legacy system there would be a need for several additional layers making it most likely way more expensive.

as long as someone can make IOUs then more money can be lend than this someone has. I highly doubt that people will mostly hold their own money due to how inconvenient bitcoin can be. In the "worst case" banks or other institutions will pay you interest for deposing bitcoin there.
edit: 


This can be done today aswell? it's just not as profitable because  its base on stochastics making lending only small amounts pretty risky.
@_date: 2018-05-27 02:49:04


if China would have bought those bonds then the taxpayers would not get the interest back. So they pay less when the federal reserve buys them which hands over all its profits to the treasury. logic.


this has nothing todo with the central bank. Governments can borrow money that they have to pay back later... thats a political thing and happened 2000 years ago as well. Thats why we have democracy and checks and balances everywhere.

it's not true in terms of volume. Maybe more individual people are invested with tiny amounts of money proportionate to other countries... but I even doubt that considering how poor these countries are. 


that reads like a comment you would find on 4chan. Maybe it's vastly different in the US but I never had a professor I would consider "leftist" especially in economic fields wich is dominated by conservatives. hell, the mainstream neoclassical economic theories are as conservative as it can get.
 


and any other option either failed even harder or has no track record at all because it simply doesn't work to sustain an economy. There is a reason why there is no currency backed by gold anymore... it wouldn't simply wouldn't be as competitive to other models. In most cases, it's the society or government behind the fiat system that is falling apart and not fiat money itself.


i simply don't like echo chambers. Also, i kinda getting bored of all the bitcoiners trying to get everyone to buy in... it's like a giant MLM-scheme where people get all their friends into so they can earn money of them.

i wrote "private" with quotation marks because of its public entity but separated from the government.
All the "profit" a central bank generates through lending money to banks goes to the government. That's why its pretty dumb to give the government direct power over the central bank or allowing governments directly borrowing money from a central bank.

this number alone is irrelevant. Such a huge debt may be bearable for the US but devastating for a very small or poor country. So growing economies can easily handle more debt. Like a few million $ debt may be nothing to a manager who earns several million a year but it would be an unpayable amount for some minimum wage worker...


again, these bonds were bought in auctions during the QE program. Why is the fed holding these bonds worse than china, private banks or private citizens holding these bonds???? please explain


normally the fed can only lend money to banks which then lend the money to governments in an open market.


no they should not. It's literally what happened in Weimar Germany where the government printed a huge amount money to pay off their war debt causing a hyper inflation.


again, whats the difference between China buying these bonds and the fed? That the fed buying these bonds is close to the government itself printing money since they get all the interest back and this removes all market mechanism lowering the overall interest rate through the additional demand of bonds as well..

the US government cant print money.


A central bank lends money to banks and these can buy US-bonds for the market price. There is a reason why a central bank is "private" and isn't allowed to directly lend money to a government or should not be directly controlled by a government.


how does the total nominal value matter? what matters is the debt to gdp ratio which was around 110% in the past as well and recovered to &lt;40%


the debt to gdp ratio doesn't grow exponentially


yes, i agree. Wars are expensive.

the energy prices in Germany are like 3 times higher than the US average and like 4-6 times higher if you adjust it to the income/purchasing power.
also, no city runs completely on renewable energy... in fact, they have to buy a lot of electricity from french nuclear power plants and only around 30% of Germany's energy production comes from renewable energy.


so I don't think it will advance solar because it's not the cheapest source of energy... in fact its pretty expensive compared to traditional plants.
@_date: 2018-05-22 00:17:33


most of these have nothing to do with the transactions which is what bitcoin is trying to replace. There will still be data centers analyzing people, still local branches and still trading centers and even plastic cards with a QR code if people want them. 
it's completely misleading putting the entire financial sector against bitcoin when its only about transacting value from person a to b which is like a tiny part of this sector... they rather want you to take loans and sell you financial products and will continue to do so regardless of bitcoins success... banks don't even make money with domestic transactions.


the thing is that you find everything on the internet on such a controversial topic. I see what I pay for renewable energy... and that's A LOT. Why do you think most renewables need to be subsidized by the government? not because of their ROIs are so short...  i put solar panels on my roof as well but only because of how much it's subsidized and government-sponsored no interest loans and the insane energy prices I have to pay and I still need 10 years to pay it off.

that is just a number. Ofc the nominal amount of debt will increase when economy grows and money inflates... i don't need to tell you that 100$ was worth far more 100 years ago than its worth today? so ofc you can make more debt because your economy backing it is much bigger and money is worth much less....
[look at this graph]( that shows the US had a higher debt to GDP ratio after the second world war.


again, for the 3rd time... this has nothing to do with the federal reserve. Governments will borrow money in a bitcoin economy as well as they did centuries ago.
you complain about the FED and then go over the debt burden while the debt has to be made by politicians and not the federal reserve. Ofc the us government has to make debts if they want to have military presence and wars across the world.

us fed pays 7% back to member banks. This is quite unique since the ECB, for example, doesn't do that at all.




ofc, if there wouldn't be a burden to repay it - the us government could borrow an unlimited amount of money that they never have to pay back. Sounds stupid? because it is.


that is increasing the money supply. When the fed buys securities it increases the money supply within an economy. The reason for more stable prices lies probably in the end of the Bretton Woods agreement and other things.


then stay stupid forever. If you want to "end the fed" you should at least properly know what they are doing and why.

ofc the federal reserve or any central bank issues the money (usually to the banks) but not the governments... they have to borrow it like anyone else in the market


its DOES exist. These are simple IOUs that can be "traded" like any other asset. Also, someone else's debt is someone else's money. 


We could make a contract that i own you money and you would be able to trade this claim. This is a pretty organic process that has been done with various kinds of money and could also be done with bitcoin aswell.


the increasing prices in schooling and medical are an American problem rooted in political decisions. Europe, for example, has actually pretty cheap college prices and medical expenses are also nowhere near us levels. Housing and other assets bubble but there were actually cheap after the 2008 bubble and the prices were actually below the average inflation.


since the fed issues the money that gets multiplied by banks - 100% are created "out of thin air" (maybe minus the minted coins and notes in some cases). It's also a zero-sum game since the US government gets all the interest the fed makes by loaning/issuing money to the banks.


you can trade bitcoin IOUS aswell... exchanges already do this. Or do you think that "physical" bitcoins change wallets when there is a trade or some margin call happened? these are just IOUs from the exchange that get traded back and forth...


the government doesn't control the interest rates -  that's the job of the central bank. Sure there are some political decisions affecting interest rates but it's mostly in the hand of the central bank.


the economy as a whole can pay these interest rates because of its a zero-sum game. It's just that the house owner can't do it.


not completly agreeing what points you wrote in that context. But just assuming it would be true - it would render the government useless and ultimately get dominated by a centralized government who can pump up a big war machinery "out of thin air".... the concept of "sound money" or just gold as money is centuries old and completely vanished because its just not competitive... especially in a global economy.

these open market operations is a standard way to increase (or decrease) the money supply. The fed can not make profits so there is little reason for a scam going on here... and who is even the one who gets scammed here? please do not say the us taxpayers... since AGAIN the government would just borrow money somewhere else and usually does since these market operations or QEs are limited.


why does this make me ignorant? some communist or other populist governments easily could do that... or just simply pump money and stimulate the economy while the next government can deal with the problems it would create...


i have never said that the debt did not exist. It's just a better deal for the us government since they get most of the interest rates paid back. In that case, the US government basically borrowed interest-free money.

greece had massive problems before it even got into euros... see the examples in my last post. Nothing to do with the euro directly.


gold lost 40% between 2011 and 2015. Stocks and real estate are on ATHs again... Anyways, you can buy gold aswell as a hedge against infaltion like people did in the past centuries.


give concrete examples. Most problems originated from bad politics. East european countries did some reforms while PIGS did not.


it doesn't matter and no one cares




cool story, tell this all the companies that dropped bitcoin.




do you even know how bitcoin works? cool story that it can "handle" 60tx/sec if there are no transactions at a later point. It still can only process a single figured number per second on average. Period


steam, stripe, expedia, reddit and many more... name handful companies this size that still use bitcoin... i will give you the first: Microsoft (which dropped and readded it several times). Bonuspoints for big companies that accept bitcoin directly and not through bitcoin-&gt;fiat services.


pretty much. Shows if the adoption reached the younger generation.


you just buy fiat with bitcoin that buys the reddit gold...

look at the computer hardware market... Most people deferring their purchases as long as possible so they can get the most bang for the bug.
In your particular example: A lot of people would wait if they expect that an even bigger car would gain you an even hotter girl. On the other hand, if you can expect that the girls you can impress with a new car get uglier every year you wait - you probably would want to buy a new car and settle down with a girl much sooner.

the end user product usually is barely affected by material costs. How hard it gonna hit a particular company depends on its place within the supply chain. If you cant imagine this then think about services for end users... falling prices will lead to pay cuts or lay offs. 


material prices range from 1%-5% of the total product cost... if consumer prices fell 5% and your material prices fell 10% but only make 2% of the total cost of the product then your profit margin will be lower... until its negative....


not necessarily, if people predict falling prices and wait with their purchases it will decrease the consumption. Also, the fear of getting laid off will make people consume less.




Most people working in finance, controlling, marketing, retail and sales went through an economic related college program... and like i wrote, the biggest cost factor is usually human resources and not materials...

yeah, can happen... happened to people with gold and silver as well. Most places recovered pretty well.


the countries had major problems before 2008. You should do your homework.


and i don't want to. 


i don't care about your shitty bcash conspircay. Fact is it was unusable when there was some tiny amount amount of traffic... and that was still maybe 1% of what bitcoin needs to be taken seriously. Bitcoin itself can only handle around 3tx/sec... that's absolutely nothing


Mpst big companies abandoned it the prices are falling since then.


where are all the companies from last December then? where can i buy steam games ? where can i buy Reddit gold with bitcoin? i cant but i could last December. Even stuff like bitpay is completely gone by now... DNM are using much more altcoins compared to last December...

thats nice.


conspiracy... most people simply don't care about such things. If you afraid of inflation then put your money on short term deposits or buy Stocks/ETFs.


thats only a benefit if everyone uses the same crypto and not 1/3 bitcoin 1/3 fiat and the other some alt coins... 


bitcoin itself is highly inefficient and cant scale on its own... it cost like 50$ to a fast transaction last december...  Oh and people had to wait weeks for their transaction to go through...


they keep going down because the hype and adoption is dying. Most big companies dropped bitcoin and bitcoin-related google traffic is only 10% of what it was last December.


LN will allow some scaling but it will hit a wall looooooooong before it comes even near the tx/sec of visa or even the whole banking system.... Read up on discrete mathematics and undirected weighted graphs and the performance problems it couses. [Even the LN devs are aware of this](

the prices were back on track within a year... the only people that got screwed were the ones buying real estate with loans. But bitcoin is soooo much more stable lol... 


such a drastic change would never come without blood and never has.


it hasnt changed much. Segwit and batching doesn't allow bitcoin to scale to a serious size... that's why LN is so hyped because its the only way it may theoretically manage to process a few hundred tx/sec. The Bitcoin network itself would collapse again in the next hype...


its now almost 10 years and the adoption is going backward... that's certainly not a good sign.

if bitcoins price is 5$ then a single block would yield around 15$ in 2024 that's only 800k (52560*15) a year.... that means miners can only invest 800k a year to secure the network before they operate on a loss.
That also means someone could bring 10 times the hash power by just spending a few millions... regardless if he does it with renewable or traditional energy sources. Probably even less since he only needs the hash power for a short period of time to seriously harm the network...

it's not just hope -&gt; its expectation. People invest in bitcoin because they EXPECT it will give them a good return. Doesn't have to be true. Same goes for inflation... it doesn't even matter if a currency i deflationary or inflationary because what matters is what people expect and that's is what determines their actions. You can easily predict what people generally gonna do who have a certain expectation about the future but you can hardly determine people's expectations and the reasons why it changes (feelings). 


it's not considered science by whom? some internet trolls who failed their physics degree? 


ofc, basic theories can be tested on humans like biologist test their theses on labor mice... is biology suddenly not a science aswell? in a lot of other fields like physics, testing a theory with a repeatable experiment can be next to impossible as well.

you discredit yourself


this would result in asking for the complete network topology in the worst case.
"So, how does Alice find a route? The only real way to do it is to send a message to all her known peers asking, “Do you have a channel with at least $30 with Dave.” So, Alice sends that message to Bob, Bill, Ben, Beth, Becky, and others in her network and waits to hear back. Guess what?  Nobody she knows has a channel with Dave. Now she must send more messages to her same peers asking, “Can you check with all your peers to see if they have a channel with Dave.” 
So now Bob, Bill, Ben, Beth, Becky and others all send out dozens of messages to their friends, and in this case, we’re in luck, Bob knows Carol, who knows Dave. With only a hundred or so messages back and forth, we found a path. But what would have happened if she needed to send money to Frank? That’s two more levels of separation, two more levels of messages back and forth, where each level grows exponentially in the number of messages that need to be sent and responded. And that’s not even the worst part – We don’t know if a path to Frank with XX dollars in it even exists. We could end up just sending messages to peers in the network all day long waiting for a positive response, clogging up the network, and never discovering a routing solution for our payment." - [source](

both are clearly defined. It's just all the people who get their econ education from mises.org or similar places...

maybe other coins/bc implementations (which have their own POW) but bitcoin so far does nothing besides transferring value from one person to another...
* bitcoin doesn't have a physical form (so citing ATM energy and cash related costs is already stupid)
* bitcoin doesn't lend any money
* bitcoin doesn't do any consulting
* bitcoin doesn't trade stocks
* bitcoin doesn't buy/sell properties
* bitcoin doesn't sell insurances
* (...)
these are the baking-services that need the most energy and they will still be there with or without bitcoin... even the need of some physical representation of bitcoins since your old grandma won't be able to scan a qr code with her smartphone...
the energy costs of transactions which are basically nothing besides changing database entries is negligible... there are online banks run with only a few dozen people serving millions of customers...
so i doubt that bitcoin will be "vastly more efficient than current systems" since it only replaces a pretty small subset of the total financial system.

They are usually mathematical frameworks designed to illustrate complex processes. What science basically does is create models of reality and conduct experiments or back it with empirical evidence that would prove the model to be wrong if they failed.
Sure in a complex topic you will have to take assumptions for some variables like you have to do in most recent science fields including physics....
Gravitation, for example, is technically still a theory since we can only observe it but we can't prove it and we don't know the why and that's where the all the theories with a lot of assumptions (like dark matter) come into play... is this not science as well?


hello, meteorology and Climatology... both core fields in "hard sciences" like physics and chemistry.


more concrete? I can't think of anyone that could be considered Austrian economist that added anything that got recognized in this field.
@_date: 2018-06-01 19:10:01


how do you know that isn't the case in any other field? Nazis for example heavily misused biology to further their agenda.


there are always different interpretation... there are people who believe the world is flat and other pseudoscience.


what differs keynesian school from heterodox economic schools is that it uses scientific methods while the other purposely reject them... basically just pseudoscience like homeopathy or most other alternative medicine.
"Since the mid-20th century, mainstream economists have been critical of the modern-day Austrian School and consider its **rejection of mathematical modelling, econometrics and macroeconomic analysis** to be outside mainstream economic theory, or "heterodox".-wikipedia

would be the hardest case but that would be a theoretically possible way to control the variables.


you can test game theories for example by simply asking people and letting them make tests.


how much can a biologist control the mice in his lab? if he does 3 tests that infect 10 mice with some kind of virus then he still will get different results each time (like 2/10 mice die then 8/10 then 4/10...) what is the exact lethality in this case?... it doesnt really matter that much, what matters is that it will cause some reaction.

blockchain and all the new concepts that are built on it can be used on way more use cases than just moving value from person a to person b.

most theorems can be backed by empirical evidence

because the people who are employed are not necessarily the ones buying the hardware. a sudden drop in sales that causes a layoff in a single branch is probably not enough to cause a deflationary feedback loop where people buy even less because they got no job or fear that they gonna lose their job.


because that industry is growing in an overall sense. Still, a lot of hardware retailers failed and almost all smaller hardware shops are gone... also looking at the pc market:
According to Jay Chou, research manager for the IDC report, there isn’t a lot in Windows 10 Creators Update that will drive hardware sales for consumer PCs. He says that for the user of what he calls a mainstream PC, such as a 15-inch notebook that “isn’t light and doesn’t give you great battery life and sells for $400 to $500,” it won’t make a huge difference.
“Those are the PCs that people are not in a hurry to upgrade,” he said in an interview with GeekWire. “I don’t think Windows Creators Update is going to change that.”
Mikako Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner, suggested that the consumer market for PCs will continue to shrink and it will be makers of business PCs that will survive.
sounds like they are struggling

Here you can send, and receive lightning payment, because the server accept them for you.
but that's a pretty centralized solution. There also needs to be some serious infrastructure when doing this on a large scale network.


Where RIPv2 is perfect for small, under 15 Hops networks, you need OSPF for larger networks. Where Multicast was 10 years ago a unicum, in a lot of (military) networks it's now a must have. And for lightning, the routing protocols always have to adapt to the size from the network.

just making "another bitcoin" obviously doesn't work.
Encarta and Wikipedia were encyclopedias. Encarta started with professional articles written by paid people and monetized through sales on CDs. They couldn't put these articles on the web since it probably wouldn't be able to monetize them at this time. Wikipedia solved this with the idea of letting amateurs write these articles for free with a good quality control system.
Bitcoin looks like just the first step that shows where the problems are and makes room for some possible solution building on the original idea. I think there is a lot of room for some new and revolutionizing ideas... especially since bitcoin still doesn't do properly what it was intended to do (e-cash system) even though it's almost 10 years old now

the REAL interest rate is the interest rate -(+) inflation(deflation). Therefore loans are always more expensive in a deflation compared to a period of inflation, that's my point. I seriously don't know how to explain this to you? I don't know about the other real rate you mentioned.


because they would slowly lose money if they would do that when there is some inflation. People don't want that so they put that money into a bank generating some interest to compensate the inflation.




this is not the topic. It's about having a working and competitive economy and some fairy tale dream that would work if everyone one and every country will play by these rules. In that case, communism could ala Marx could work as well but that's not the reality.

Blockchain != bitcoin
The blockchain is comparable to the internet while **bitcoin and all other forks are the businesses** using that technology. Many Coins WILL fail since they want to do the exact same as another coin.


and you don't seem to understand that bitcoin also has some fundamental flaws. It will NEVER be able to do transactions as efficient as databases can do. It's just physically impossible since a certain amount computing power is needed to secure the network and bitcoin current iteration uses A LOT of computing power to do transactions. Don't get me started on deflation...
In your example, a traditional transaction can be a trigger for executing any code as well? that's nothing special and bitcoin cant do smart contracts yet (that's ethereums territory).


the difference is that MLMs don't want to sell the product to you... they want to sell you the concept of selling their product. That's how you get people to buy worthless garbage. This reddit, for example, don't want you to sell you bitcoin as the product. They specifically tell not to use it and hodl it. They sell the concept of getting rich like MLMs do.


exactly. That is what I'm trying to tell you the whole time. The price is backed by speculation and not real demand.


and that's not the exact same thing happening in crypto? people investing in coins that have no usage or do not understand at all. These 400 coins basically ARE all businesses with CEOs, devs, and marketing gaining their revenue mostly based on premined coins and the infrastructure around the coin.


the Blockchain will have some applications in the future for sure. Will it be used to do money transactions? maybe. Will the coin that is using the tech be called bitcoin? doubtful but ok.
Bitcoin was created like 8 years ago and its adoption is still pretty bad. The internet took less time until it became mainstream while bitcoin doesn't even come close to mainstream adoption yet.


that's a creative of evading having to admit that you were wrong. :D


you keep telling that I don't understand bitcoin. That is what MLMs participants would tell critics as well... you even say that a Nobel prize winner doesn't understand it. So i guess 99% of people investing in crypto don't understand it...
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:10:10






ofc it does? The concept of real interest rate is used to account for the impact of inflation. In the case of a loan, it is this real interest that the lender effectively receives.






are you sure?
equation according to Fisher: real interest rate(r) = nominal interest rate (i) - expected inflation rate(p)
changing the inflation will directly affect the real interest rate. 
Example: If the inflation rises after I got a loan then it would get cheaper.
in case of a sudden hyperinflation, a 1000$ 2% interest loan could be worthless in a year aka 'cost' of the loan would be next to nothing. How can you say that Inflation and deflation don't change the real interest rate????
I'm not sure if you are trolling me so i cant respond to your other stuff until i know what you are talking about.

but does the actual adoption really reflect the current price? Shops that directly accepting bitcoins is still pretty low. Services like bitpay certainly did not get a 1000% increase in their transaction volume.
the total transactions of bitcoin itself haven't even changed that much within this year. Some shops also starting to accept more alt coins due to fees or increased anonymity for dark web purchases.


but it seems like most people treat it like that. They never intend to buy anything with bitcoin and see it as a financial investment.

Sure Bitcoin may or may not allow an instant purchases with low fees in the future but that's not in line with the narrative of bitcoin as digital gold that can have high fees and be slow.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:48:33

that's not what Wikipedia and the equations say. 
What you may be trying to say is that people automatically pricing in the inflation so their real interest is the same (which they do), but my whole point was that this doesn't work with deflation since a negative nominal interest is impossible.

i agree


but isn't this just a subjective value?


we can argue years about the definition of bubbles and won't come to a conclusive answer. Most people don't see the bubble until it pops and if bitcoin is a bubble and would pop this wouldn't mean that it will vanish. Tulip prices still rise and get speculated on.
[Robert J. Shiller]( who won the Nobel Prize in Economics for his research in bubbles recently called bitcoin the biggest financial bubble at this time. Completly denying the **possibility** of it being a huge bubble is just wrong.


the hype is based on the story of bitcoin that includes the technology and its potential. This doesn't mean the story will deliver what it tells.
During the dot-com bubble, people thought you could translate every business model into the internet. Like [selling groceries over the internet]( The story of the internet was also based technology, potential, utility, and its future. It obviously was revolutionary and changed everything, but yet it still was overhyped to some degree... It changed everything but in a lot of cases not the way people have predicted.
I'm just saying that people are pretty bad in predicting the future, the blockchain technology may not be used for transacting money (but changed the game on other fields) because it may turn out not to be as good as predicted or the [traditional way of transacting money just adapts]( so the usage of bitcoin doesn't have any advantages for the average consumer anymore.
Competing with (almost) free instant transactions gonna be hard for bitcoin.


i don't think that bitcoin was made to be a con or supposed to be a con. It's just that bitcoin itself gives a huge incentive for people to shill. If you want the value of your bitcoin investment to increase, you gonna keep telling everyone to buy bitcoin (increase demand) and hodl it (decrease supply), and that's what this whole sub is doing. This sounds more like some network marketing / multi-level marking scheme where people try to get other people to buy in through self-fueled viral Marketing. This caused a creation of echo chambers skewing the real picture of bitcoin. 
Like these MLM schemes, It's not mostly the product that gets sold - its the concept of getting rich that is being sold. A lot people who bought into bitcoin never intend to buy anything with it. They want to get rich.


If next week, everyone who owned GBP exchanged it to EUR, what do you think would happen? GBP would plummet. EUR would sky rocket. There would be an abundance of GBP which no-one wants, and there wouldn't be enough EUR to go around.
Simple supply and demand. You cannot seriously be this basic to not understand this.
I said that it's just not that easy to boil it down to simple Simple supply and demand. Currency exchange rates go up and down every day but have little to no influence on the consumer prices. The exchange rate (or supply and demand of that currency) itself doesn't necessarily have a direct impact on the supply and demand of goods and services. Its usually through indirect factors like cheaper imports.
It gets complicated because there are [several "types" of money]( The money supply for good and services is usually the liquid money and not the money people have in long-term savings (which is the money that gets traded on exchanges). This means that the overall supply of a currency doesn't have to have an effect on the supply of money that used to buy goods and services. 
For your GBP example. It would make a huge difference in consumer prices if the people who bought the GBP either use it to consume goods in Britain or holding it as an investment.
There are also many montery instruments that could be used to keep the prices somewhat stable without changeing the supply of the money itself.


I'm not bashing it. I'm criticising it especially when people claim that its a 100% sure investment.

what kind of response did you expect?


that's the million dollar question. The raw data about bitcoin do not fit the growth in price. 8 years after the introduction bitcoin there are still almost zero shops that directly accepting bitcoin. A few big players adopted services like Bitpay but these services certainly did not grow 10x during this year like the bitcoin price would suggest. Altcoins gaining popularity in dark web markets and seem to slowly replace bitcoin there as well.
This kinda makes bitcoin look massive speculation. Some altcoins had even bigger gains and there is virtually nothing you can do with them except speculating. Bitcoin could be the next PayPal in the future, sure... but it also could lose to some altcoin or none of them will ever be as big as PayPal. There are still massive scalability issues that need to be solved first since the current iteration of bitcoin just sucks compared to PayPal as an everyday payment tool.


that's where i have my doubts.
Most people who bought into bitcoin NEVER intend to buy anything with it at all. They are just speculating and waiting for a bigger fool. But the supply of bigger fools must run out one day.
the whole crypto community acts like some cult or MLM group wanting to sell stuff to you. There is nothing more penetrant than a crypto fanatic shilling for his coin on every channel and like an MLM scheme, he gains money by bringing more people into the system. Both have a built-in viral marketing system that can work really well... but that doesn't mean the product itself is not utter garbage that no one will actually use.
 
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:34:37
so, the models assume that outcomes that are being forecast do not differ systematically from the market equilibrium results and people don't do systematic errors when predicting the future.
This assumption is always part of everything I wrote here. When I talk about a single loan then it represents the market equilibrium and the timeframe doesn't really matter here.




what makes you so sure that the lender can realize his demands? I mean the cost of opportunity alone will drive more people into lending out money since
doing nothing with your money will lead to not earning the 10%. More people will try to lend out money to cover the inflation alone leading to a higher supply of loans versus the same demand of loans.
In your deflation scenario, not doing anything with your money would have no opportunity costs at all. Fewer people will lend out money -&gt; money supply is lower -&gt; same demand for money -&gt; higher interest rates.


why would anyone lend money for the nominal rate of 0% and lower? You lend me 100$ just to get 100$ back in a year? You obviously will ask for more to cover possible risks and efforts you have to put in for that loan.


that's the Fisher equation. It also says that loans that get lend out for 10% interest in a 5% inflation result in 5% real interest. You argue like if the real interest determines the nominal interest rates and inflation rate while it's clearly the other way around. 
The real interest rate can only be determined Ex-post when the actual inflation is known (Wikipedia) and lenders may not be able to realize their desired real interest. I mean there could be 5% inflation but the lenders are only able to realize a 6% nominal interest rate (due to supply and demand... maybe no one needs loans at all) which will result in a 1% real interest rate.
[here a chart over a longer period showing the inflation, nominal interest, and real interest](
you can clearly see that there were periods of negative real interest because lenders weren't able to realize higher nominal rates. Loans are bound to supply and demand as well as any other good. Even if the inflation would always be a constant and never changes - the real interest would still go up and down due to increasing or decreasing demand or supply for loans.

but for production to happen there needs to be a demand first.


ok i give you two reasons:
1. deflation causes loans to be more expensive. The business has to pay back the deflation rate + the % that make lender willing to risk their money and lending it to you. Fewer loans -&gt; fewer businesses -&gt; fewer jobs -&gt; depression
2. deflation causing people to push back their consume into the future. This was observed during many deflationary phases in different countries. Less consume-&gt; less production -&gt; fewer jobs -&gt; depression

it's probably a bubble. Bitcoin stopped being a currency becuase of scaling issues and now it wants to be a commodity. This whole 'it stores value'.... No it doesn't. Its its useful instant peer-to-peer at low fees is gone. So its value is just coming from the fact that its finite?  Bitcoin is just riding its own initial momentum wave at this point.

not true? 
if I lend you 100$ with 2% deflation and 2% interest rate then the effective cost of that loan is 4%. 
If i lend you 100$ with 2% inflation and 2% interest rate then the effective cost of that loan is 0%. 
if I lend you 100$ with 2% deflation and 0% interest rate then the effective cost of that loan is 2%. 
If i lend you 100$ with 2% inflation and 1% interest rate then the effective cost of that loan is -1%. 
i  cant lend you 100$ with 2% deflation and -2% interest rate, no one ever would lend someone 100$ just to get 98$ back when risking nothing would give you 100$. There is no such thing as a (nominal) negative interest rates in this case.
the deflation rate has to be added in addition to the interest rate someone is willing to risk their money.


what the optimal amount of loans are or the quota people saving and spending their money gets calculated every day by the central banks and governments.


inflation also causes people investing their money instead of just putting it under their pillow


and why should the production fall in the first place? usually, because they projected that demand is falling first or in some rare cases the lack of resources or political mismanagement.


there is always an economic cycle but trying to enforce a steady deflation is wanting a hangover every morning without even having enjoyed some drinks.

There is and was a lot of research on this topic.


I never said that and Wikipedia probably didn't as well. Deflation is usually a catalysator the enforces the drop in consumer spending.


too much inflation is also bad. That why all central banks have a target of around 2% inflation that they want to hold.


well, Economy science is social study and relies on human behavior. There were countless recessions were observed and peoples action were put into theoretical models. 
falling prices lead to less spending leading to people losing their job and creating a feedback loop (deflationary spiral). You can it actually see right here where HODL and not spending your bitcoins became a meme.

asked that question myself. 
If vendors pulling back with their adoption of bitcoin then what is bitcoin even good for? because people think its a store of value so it has to be worth x without any real demand or backing? 
Cryptocurrencies are still vastly different compared to gold and other natural resources that at least have some real-life applications and got established as a store of value over centuries. I also cant just fork gold and make a new metal with the exact same features.

never disagreed. Its possible but not certain and in my opinion, it has huge risks. 










you worte so much, yet you said so little that I haven't already said as well...
You listed some of the issues with bitcoin. Putting transactions off chain via LN doesn't magically remove transaction fees. Its just put some relieve on the blockchain when exchanges and b2b transaction can be handled over it. It's not a final solution to the scaling problem, just the first step.
The whole blockchain technology itself has a few question marks. For example, its impossible to come even near the efficiency of transacting money via simple database changes since it needs to solve hashes in order to confirm a transaction. [It's also not like the traditional banking system isn't adapting as well.]( 


according to your definition, there was never a dotcom bubble or a real estate bubble because it recovered a few years later.
Look, I'm just saying that the bitcoin hype is mostly based on the idea that bitcoin embodies and its possibility to become something really useful and is accelerated by a never seen amount of shills trying to get other people to invest (or adopt) bitcoin. If the bitcoin devs can deliver, fine, you have something really big. The devs during the dotcom hype, for example, could not deliver their promises.


i know that. But you claimed that they accept bitcoin while in the real world only some franchisee who happens to be crypto enthusiastic accept them in his shop and not the whole chain. Stuff like this is promoted as "Subway accepts bitcoin" which is not true and skews the picture of the true economic performance of bitcoin and its real level of adoption (that influences the bitcoin price because it gets overestimated.).


Inflation or deflation is not defined through exchange rates to other currencies. In economics, inflation is defined as a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. That topic is a little bit more complex than boiling it down to just a simple "supply and demand graph".

1. about your definition of an investment. Debateable.
2. that bitcoin would substantially reduce the fee for sending money. 
The current iteration of bitcoin simply sucks as a payment tool because it's slow and has high fees. If BTC ever goes mainstream there would also need to be some systems placed on top just to prevent fraud and money laundering that will increase the price of a single transaction even further. 
Overall, due to the nature of the blockchain technology, bitcoin will never be able to be as efficient as a simple change in database entries. The EU shows that cheap traditional transactions are possible by allowing (almost) free wire transfers across the SEPA region. The next step is allowing [instant payments]( within 10 seconds and minimal friction.

i serious don't understand what are you trying to say. 
I provided you the math showing you that deflation adds up to the (real) cost of loans while inflation can be subtracted. The % risk markup that a lender wants covers his effort and the possibility that the borrower will default which is the same regardless of the inflation or deflation rate.
I'm not sure if you understood the concept of real and nominal and deflation and inflation itself.


I never said anything about banning. I just said that inflation gives an incentive for people to bring their money to banks where it can be reinvested in businesses.


debatable. There is no math behind i know that can prove this since its more of a psychological thing.


see top...
i linked you a Wikipedia page ( saying:


In the case of contracts stated in terms of the nominal interest rate, the real interest rate is known only at the end of the period of the loan, based on the realized inflation rate; this is called the ex-post real interest rate. Since the introduction of inflation-indexed bonds, ex-ante real interest rates have become observable.[2]
there is clearly there is a link between the inflation rate and real interest rate

no, it's hard to explain without throwing accounting terms around. The bank "loses" as much money as you gain. The bank loses cash but gains claims against you while you gain cash but gain liabilities.
The interest is basically the bank's profit and is shown like that on their balance sheet. In the end, their profits are used to pay employees, shareholders and cover defaulting loans. All three cases sending the interest-profits right back into the economy as ... money!

I'm not sure if I understood your question. The interest a central bank generates from the money that it lends to commercial banks gets send to us treasury and injected back into the economy through government spending.
The same goes for the commercial banks. They inject the profits they make for lending out money back into the economy as well and thus allowing enough money to be in existence to pay back the loan+interest.

@_date: 2017-11-21 00:46:40


I don't know why this would even matter.  Please explain this to me and maybe back it up with math.


with a 5% deflation, the minimum cost of a loan is 5% if it gets lend out for 0% nominal interest. This doesn't change if its 1000x contracts over decades or just one. 
5% is pretty high on a loan compared to the -5% during an inflation. Businesses would have to work harder to make their investment worth that loan.


inflation is always better for the borrower regardless if this long-term or short term.

I was talking about the raw economic data, obviously...


more businesses accepting bitcoin? [is this really true?](
"We couldn't use our bitcoin at Subway, which is on a few lists of retailers that accept bitcoin. Le Village, a restaurant in New York's East Village that many have reported accepts bitcoin, was closed down when we tried to eat there." [source](
the acceptance of raw bitcoin without services like bitpay is still pretty low. Most of these small businesses on that list properly never sold anything with bitcoin and just using it as cheap method promoting their shop. The total amount of transaction per day didn't even increase since last November. 


Proven track history of bubbling every 2 years and massive market manipulation? You can put these tags on any somewhat successful companies' stocks. Doesn't mean it a sure bet that it won't fall apart in the next 5 years.


exactly and hoping that the devs can solve the massive scaling issues is speculation... they may solve it or they won't.


my point is that bitcoin needs some proper adoption and not just to be used as an investment asset. Without proper usage and thus natural demand, you just trading worthless data to a bigger fool. This can collapse as soon as the hype dies down and not enough new "investors" can be found.


that's certainly not how currency works. This is called deflation and combated on all channels. See, this is where I know you don't understand anything about currencies...


same back to you. It's just the whole crypto community feels like an echo chamber and every criticism gets suppressed while every pro-coin news form some 3rd-grade spam site gets hyped. Everyone acts like if they are the smartest and everyone who disagrees is either a shill, has no clue or is "concern trolling" while the crypto community itself disagrees with each other... or otherwise there wouldn't be like 40 forks with more to come.
I mean, every altcoin subreddit would present their coin assure investment... similar argumentation like yours... but in the end, there will probably just be one coin left. Think about it.
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:25:00

@_date: 2018-03-31 01:29:05
how many times gonna people post the same news lol
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:35:45


its still much lower as it used to be and keep in mind: people rarely unsub. 
also, the sub/day peak was 19k on this subreddit.
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:47:24
glad to hear
@_date: 2018-03-20 22:31:45
googled it and couldn't find it. That's why I'm asking you to provide it if you can.
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:58:11
why is it misleading?
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:34:51


but only a tiny fraction of what the prices indiacted. 


why would it stabilize and why would people use it? if LN doesn't deliver a working payment system that can scale then i don't see any acceptance... in the best case bitcoin becomes a payment processor since merchant still will want the legal tender - even if its enforced by governments.
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:59:53


read the other subreddits they are full of shit talking LN. I cant really evaluate its flaws.
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:13:06


they do quite a lot? it's quite hard to find anything like that outside the tor network...
@_date: 2018-03-22 12:14:24
you are so funny... this is not a topic to joke around with.
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:44:46
Tor doesn't host such content. Also, quite a lot tor exit node owner got raided by police and even the developers advising not to run one in your home or non-anonymous.
So its debatable... at least in developed countries its mostly used for shady actions.
@_date: 2018-03-20 23:21:04
bitcoin is built around being somewhat anonymous through multiple mixers and other services. If you are so smart and know it better then go find the perpetrator, but you don't care.
Such people be chased and also not have a platform they can use.
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:28:22
i can lend out IOU's on bitcoin if I want so could banks... 
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:32:09
this is bad.
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:53:14
Stock prices of a company tend to fall if the fundamental data like sales and market shares are below the expectations. There is no magic in it... and a reason why insider trading is a thing.
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:07:33


both cases can be the cause and can amplify each other.
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:46:59


by every news agency in the world covering it. 


everything on your computer is encoded.... 


almost like people trying to share such content over file hoster? Ofc no one can access it without the proper passwords but that doesn't mean it doesn't get shared.
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:00:42
bitcoin started with a valuation of like 1 cent. Are you telling me bitcoin is in a decade-long upwards trend until it hits 0 cents?
@_date: 2018-03-18 13:46:35
I think there is more needed than just "some bullish news" to reverse the trend. Crypto has some fundamental issues like the lack of actual adoption across the board. In my opinion, it comes down if the bitcoin LN network is a success and generates some actual merchant adoption or not.
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:00:17


no its an actual picture and some links
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:47:42
its also an actual cp image stored within the blockchain...
and even just links to such sites could be a problem that every owner of a website can confirm.
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:25:37
it's called hex-editor...
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:26:06
@_date: 2018-03-21 23:55:20


yeah, we are talking about child abuse images.
it's about very short numbers. but we are talking about a quite large one... your point?
you are aware that every digital program is a series of zero and ones which also... equals a number... this number can be easily converted into decimal hex 8bit 16bit whatever... it's still the same data containing the same information.


file hosters also usually don't have a  malicious intent and yet they have to delete this data as soon as they get the knowledge of its existence. The blockchain is hosting child porn and now everyone knows about it...
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:43:20


yeah, ofc. There are also instructions needed to get such content from filehosters (password or how to encrypt), yet they are still legally required to remove this content as soon as they get knowledge of it.
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:47:49
tell this the United States and their global dominance...
@_date: 2018-03-30 12:14:24
learn the definition of deflation, please.


@_date: 2018-03-22 14:07:39


but in your case, the script contains every information and you would need such image to even create that script first place. In the end, you would share a program that puts out the image that you have put in there which isn't much different from normal images...
@_date: 2018-03-31 01:33:53
people clinching on TA-memes and mental gymnastics like Chinese new year instead of evaluating the fundamental values of bitcoin like usability and adoption just shows this is a suckers rally since the very beginning...
@_date: 2018-03-21 21:03:50
any mental gymnastics you are trying won't justify he fact that the blockchain is containing an actual image of an abused child and people are unwilling sharing and distributing it.
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:57:29
its stored as a sequence of hex values and you could put it together by hand if you want... inform yourself, please.
@_date: 2018-03-21 21:20:27
you don't know what you are talking about... it doesn't matter if you don't put a ".jpg" behind it or have splitted it in 80 tiny parts... it's still an image showing an abused child.
@_date: 2018-03-21 21:36:33


but we are not talking about a theory here. You act like the data just happen to be the same as the on of a child porn image.... the images were put there by someone on purpose for everyone else to view and access.


with that argument, you would walk free with every single cybercrime. "that encrypted file with that password just happens to decrypt into child porn".
@_date: 2018-03-29 18:37:48
of it is
I can lend out 10 times the amount of bitcoin people have deposited in my bank and that will work until everyone wants their real BTC back at the same time... fiat banks don't work any different.
@_date: 2018-03-21 23:36:49


[they are](
educate yourself, please.


every data can be represented by a number you dipshit. Would make many things easier if you could avoid every copyright law that way...


that's not the point. ITs already created and STORED on the blockchain.


and distributing such content. and where did i refuse to "acknowledge that it is the act of creating and viewing illegal content that is against the law"? ... learn to read, please.
@_date: 2018-03-28 14:46:07
and that doesn't make bitcoin a protocol. If you build a website that uses the HTTP protocol doesn't make the website ítself a protocol ...
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:07:51
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:56:03
because stock markets can be a risky short-mid term and have somewhat high entry barriers.
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:16:46
it is or it has to be since otherwise there wouldn't be any form of working copyright anymore or stopping child abusers from monetizing their sick hobby.
allowing people openly trading hex strings representing child abuse images/videos sound like a libertarian dystopia for me.
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:20:59
because the popularity of bitcoin and crypto, in general, is declining. Just look at the google trends, crypto related yt views, transaction volumes and so on...
it's the truth no one here wants to accept.
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:58:32
like downloading a splitted .rar achieve (special process) full of cp with a password (outside knowledge) only obtainable from the dark web?... would still be hosting and distributing child porn the second you were aware what these archives containing....
the stuff in the blockchain is neither encrypted nor has any other form of protection thus open to the public.
@_date: 2018-03-22 14:17:19


you can represent everything digital in binary, hex, decimal and switch between and so on. Does changing the codec of a video the actual content of that video? does the use of 64 bit instead of 32 change the content of the file? no, it doesn't...


it can propagate this content and it does... it's just not convenient. Bitcoin is actually affected the least while there are many other blockchains that allowing way more information to be storred.


because you cant sue the whole internet but individual hosters who refuse (or can't) to remove such content.
@_date: 2018-03-22 19:55:20


"Illegal and Condemned Content. Bitcoin’s blockchain contains at least eight

you are wrong and have no clue what you are talking about.

you can store any arbitrary data and thus you can store anything imaginable... just very inefficient. Do you even computer?

@_date: 2018-03-29 21:34:18


not gonna happen


they get a promise that they get bitcoins form a bank of America at any time they want... this promise (iou) doesn't have to be backed by real bitcoins as long as its backed by trust in the said bank.
There is zero difference how banks work today and you can do the exact same thing with bitcoin. Exchanges are already doing this and people rather park their money there than in an actual wallet... and no one knows if they could everyone back to 100%.

most of them use bitpay which makes me think that no one uses it all due to insane fees.
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:24:39


this is one method. There are many other like using the OP-return space that allows adding around 80 bytes of arbitrary data to every output.


the sequence is usually chronologically.


the wrote that their detector couldn't find it but they found a forum post with instructions how to retrieve it. Sounds kinda like warez boards where you get the link + password and how to install the crack... 
with services they probably meant something like this

You can figure out the character encoding by literally just looking at the characters... especially something as common as hex, binary or decimal and it's a non-issue to convert it between each. Every it college student will have to do this - by hand.


well, but people found the info... that's why it made news (again). It was actually discovered years ago.


yeah, its inconvenient.
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:25:49
sure they can with bitcoin IOUS...  every exchange could do it right now and lend people "bitcoins" they can trade...
@_date: 2018-03-22 23:58:57


but it is illegal... 
us law is pretty clear
"Undeveloped film, undeveloped videotape, and **electronically stored data that can be converted** into a visual image of child pornography are also deemed illegal visual depictions under federal law."
@_date: 2018-03-22 09:59:08
most countries consider linking to such sites a violation.

and? its just to illustrate that its possible
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:44:00


I'm pretty sure its a recognized science field since everyone and their mother refers it a science.

hardly doubt that most people posting here have seen a college from the inside at all.
Feels like big chunk belief in conspiracy theories like [this one]( and also seem to follow ["alternative science"]( like Austrian economics and ancap bs.
The Bitcoin community actually improved quite a lot... back in the bitcoin talk forum it seemed like 90% of the posters believe in some weird conspiracy theories.
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:59:19
it's a social science and actually more a science than mathematics and engineering.
"Contemporary science is typically subdivided into the natural sciences which study the material world, the social sciences which study people and societies, and the formal sciences like mathematics. Some do not consider formal sciences to be true science as theories within these disciplines cannot be tested with physical observations. [...] As a slow process over centuries, the word "science" became increasingly associated with what is today known as the scientific method, a structured way to study the natural world." -wikipedia
"Whether mathematics itself is properly classified as science has been a matter of some debate. Some thinkers see mathematicians as scientists, regarding physical experiments as inessential or mathematical proofs as equivalent to experiments. Others do not see mathematics as a science because it does not require an experimental test of its theories and hypotheses. Mathematical theorems and formulas are obtained by logical derivations which presume axiomatic systems, rather than the combination of empirical observation and logical reasoning that has come to be known as the scientific method. In general, mathematics is classified as formal science, while natural and social sciences are classified as empirical sciences." -wikipedia
"Disciplines which use science like engineering and medicine may also be considered to be applied sciences." -wikipedia

meh, the interest of people in bitcoin just declined a lot compared to December/january. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:03:59


well, I don't know. You could make a case of node owners distributing links and images with that content in a lot of countries. I don't think that this will happen anytime soon but you can be sure that this will come up again and again.
A lot of other blockchains will face this problem on another scale. Like theoretically someone could sell child porn openly with the Ether network in front of everyone face and no one could do anything about it since its easy to be untraceable in the crypto univserse. I don't think the public will accept this.
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:19:40
well, if your sales went down 80% then there may be some fundamental issues that cant be fixed with some marketing. Like people just don't want flip phones anymore.
Adoption rates went down quite a lot and general interest in crypto is declining as well. Does it mean that it will keep going in that direction? no. But its the best guess you can make out of this data.
@_date: 2018-03-21 22:32:51


But he is using the blockchain to host this kind of data. Filehosters are already there as well and basically, you just add a bit data to complete unrelated data lying around on all the HDDs and allowing everyone else to access it. 
Whats the difference between adding small data bits to a blockchain that can be added back together or uploading small data bits 


there could probably an image of the stars containing the same data... yeah I know. It's just it's nearly impossible making this whole point moot.


well, I guess a lot of people are aware now that the blockchain is containing such material. Ofc a judge makes the last call.
@_date: 2018-03-31 22:49:00


glad you learned something


Has nothing to do with efficiency... people just buying fewer phones for example because they got more expensive in terms of higher [opportunity costs](

ok lol
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:37:16
that even "useless things" need people to build and sell that generates jobs and so on? 
its no doubt bad for the economy (and no one wants that... ) and don't come with "waste of resources" when bitcoin wastes an insane amount of energy... 
@_date: 2018-03-21 23:02:33


That's not the same... you would need some certain instructions/algorithm for this to be possible while you can get a cp image by summing up hex values from transaction outputs in chronological order...
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:24:41
i think it comes down to how the LN will perform
in general: the hype of bitcoin had its peak and it's gonna hard to build such a hype up again.
@_date: 2018-03-22 21:20:46
you are making a false equivalence. Important is where the info the information is stored and not how complex is to generate the image out of it.
You are literally saying that an encrypted image would be okay because it's extreamly complex to decrypt.
With the example from your previous post. It doesn't matter if you get the color from the pixels of another computer, from a database running somewhere else or just from a table like your computer would initially do. The information where to find the color and what to do is stored in your program.
In the blockchain case, the data about what pixel goes where is stored inside the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:02:29


why are you talking about stuff you have no clue? why? tell me, please?
you can use the opcode space in multiple transaction outputs to store larger images and has been done quite a lot already. [see](
again, why are you talking about stuff you have no clue and shit talking other new sources? why?

@_date: 2018-03-22 13:00:15
you don't need a program to construct. You can store the hex value representation of an image file in the "comment section" of transaction outputs. Adding them up in a hex editor will result in a normal jpg file.


because of the script containing all the information of that image. You would just be painting it similar to how a computer or browser or anything would paint that image.
@_date: 2018-03-22 22:57:26
because this is about a digital image and not cooking meth. Also, the act itself and the end product (meth) would be illegal.
so if you want to paste it to the blockchain case... possessing meth (the cp image) and cooking meth (constructing the image ) would both make it illegal.

@_date: 2018-03-22 16:43:55


Tor itself doesn't host anything... its still servers lying around somewhere that using Tor to prevent anyone from finding their locations.
The difference is that these servers with such content are well hidden and protected in a way that it makes it impossible to trace its location or the owner and thus making it impossible to shut it down.
While bitcoin nodes are pretty public and you could make a case of them distributing knowingly child pornography. So they could made to be shut down since they cant remove this content without a hard fork. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 01:09:03

you could also look up the deflation article on Wikipedia.

@_date: 2018-03-22 13:18:24
dunno, you can't get rid of the images and links that are already put into the blockchain without a hard fork. Maybe remove the "comment section" of transaction outputs so at least this method cant be used anymore.
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:23:14
see ya next October where we can buy bitcoin for 2k again.
@_date: 2018-03-20 23:39:17
but it's known how to access it... it's basically just hex values that you could paste together by hand if you want.
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:06:16
it's like very small zip part you can put together. Just need to add up the hex values chronologically and you get a jpg.
@_date: 2018-03-20 22:17:44
but if I would tell the hoster of that kitty image that it contains child pornography then he would be obliged to take it down regardless how well its hidden inside the file...
also downloading and just storing while knowing that it contains such content may be very problematic under a lot of justifications.

it was a lagging indicator on the bull run for sure

@_date: 2018-03-29 23:29:02
yeah "deflationary economy" isn't a term... and yeah people are worried about declining gdp and that why they tend to stored hording money and spending/investing less causing a deflation. 


the incentive is the same as in a growing economy but a growing allows for riskier or less wealth-producing ventures in addition to high wealth-producing ventures... also it's not that easy since alot companies are "non-wealth producing" for years but turn into  "high-wealth producing" companies later.

it's academic consensus... 
what do you want? empirical studies? proof that it is academic consensus?
some empirical papers from google:
"When prices are falling, consumers have an incentive to delay purchases and consumption until prices fall further, which in turn reduces overall economic activity. When purchases are delayed, productive capacity is idled and investment falls, leading to further reductions in aggregate demand." - wikipedia
you will find the same in every economic school / college book.
that's enough proof of it being the academic consensus...
if you doubt the dominant science then go read up these books and check the sources yourself.

yeah no shit.


technology != protocol...
these protocols are still dominant because its a standard everyone has implemented and it makes no sense to make a competing one and all these protocols got revised and changed throughout decades.
You could as well have brought up traffic rules as an example... still a v1 protocol that is still dominant after inception after various changes and zero reasons to make a competing set of traffic rules...
none of this has anything to do with bitcoin that is a product build with some underlying protocols like almost every other product.

you are basically saying let's drown the economy now and keep it there because it will temporarily decline in the future anyway... 
yeah, people would probably save more money but that also means that they are earning less money in a deflation because they are spending less... at some point, the people will run out of their savings. I don't see how this could be any good... the economy needs invention to generate innovations and also people define their quality of living through consume.

password protected RAR files are "encoded" as well but yet you will get into trouble if it contains illegal material and you have knowledge of it.

Cached data is not stored data. Also, people got busted for having cp in their browser cache as well. The problem is mainly nodes distributing such the data and theoretically would be as responsible for it as some website that knowingly hides (and hosts) child porn images inside the webpage HTML.


in most jurisdictions, service provider are only responsible for the content when they get knowledge of it. Usually, laws give them a certain timeframe to remove this kind of content until they are made responsible for it. If someone running a node gets informed then he can do what? fork the node? close it? do you see the legal problem here?

that does not work that way
1. will people purchase more?
With more money, they will purchase more but falling prices can cause people to hold back and postpone their purchases.
2. will companies get loans?
if there is less money that can get lend then there is fewer money businesses can invest. keep in mind that a business needs to earn the (deflation + risk surcharge) for their loan while under an inflationary system they only would need to earn the (rusk surcharge - inflation) to break even.
Overall this will lower the amount businesses and creates a chain reaction -&gt; fewer jobs -&gt; grimmer future prospects -&gt; more people hoarding money that gets not invested and spent anywhere -&gt; fewer loans for businesses -&gt; fewer business investments -&gt; fewer jobs ....

and who knows if a startup is a good or bad investment? it's a huge difference if a loan costs 3% or 9% and an investment that would at least add a small nominal value would not be worth it under a deflation even though they would add value.


look, if a deflation would be healthy and competitive then there would be some countries running on such system considering most a lot countries went through "deprivation" forcefully and could have just stayed there... Yet countries like Japan and other did everything to get out of there 


that says you... for some people the quality of life is just defined by fashion. They would be pretty unhappy if wouldn't be to follow every fashion trend.


what is wasteful spending? obv. if people have less money to spend then they have to budget what they want to buy. It would still reduce the quality of life of most people... I mean do I really need the newest iPhone? no, but its still nice to have.

it's pretty simple. less interest in bitcoin -&gt; fewer new people buying in. You don't need to be a genius to know how this will affect the price.

the crash forced radical changed in their economic policies and also people's economic outlock worse that led to people hoarding money and neither investing or spending it.
"In response to chronic deflation and low growth, Japan has attempted economic stimulus and thereby run a fiscal deficit since 1991.[18] These economic stimuli have had at best nebulous effects on the Japanese economy and have contributed to the huge debt burden on the Japanese government. Expressed as a percentage of GDP, at 240% Japan has the highest level of debt of any nation on earth"

not necessarily. The inflation rate is and was pretty stable and "flooding the market with money" when the 2008 crisis caused a deflation was the right thing to do.

its created through IOUs (debt). The bank employees get paid by bank IOUs that equals $4 that you can collect from them to pay your debt. In this case, you cancel your debt with the money the bank owes its employees.
same for the government that either gets a physical dollar directly from the central bank or works with IOUs aswell..


because that is how money works. It's not just the physical cash... it can also be credit which is one's asset and the other ones liability.

just said thats HOW it works. Why it has to work this or why other systems don't work at all can be found inside the academic literature.


aha, no its not.  Its the best period for a "consumer" to be alive... 


actually, the central bank keeps this in check through a multitude of instruments.


not true, the machine runs without debt as well... just slower. You seem to think that Keynes or central banks invented debt and credit... that's not true. Kenyes just described ways to properly handle it.
People borrowing more then they should happend with gold and will happen with bitcoin as well... banks won't vanish as well as fractional reserve that existed for centuries..


well, because the money is better used in funding new businesses.


Also not true. Ofc people who are in debt a lot will suffer the most. This overspending is not because of "the system"... its because of the way humans work. Also, banks may collect houses but lose a lot of assets as well and are only able to resell these houses for a small price during that time.

"For gold, we assume an energy consumption of 175 Gigajoules per kilogram of gold mined. Around 3100 metric tons of gold are mined every year, putting the total energy requirement of gold mining close to 150 terawatt-hours per year." 
bitcoin already consumes about half of the energy bitcoin consumes according to digiconomist. If bitcoin would be at 300k then it would need magnitudes more energy than gold mining...


that renewable is expensive as fuck and not a solution if we don't lower consumption as well.

i posted a quote saying that unpredictablity "reduces its ability to serve as a reliable store of value" aka a less predictable assset = a less reliable store of value until its not a store of value at all anymore.
again, in your definition, electronics or synthetic textiles would be a store of value aswell because neither of them "go bad" like milk or wheat. 
stop trying to desperately evade my point and answer my question: are cloths and electronics a store of value? they dont "go bad" if stored properly.

i think you overcomplicating this.


liabilities (or debts) are money. 


you can write hand-write notes with each other... ist called an invoice that creates a liability that can be traded. That's called factoring and is pretty common 
Bank liabilities work the same way only that they aren't discounted because central banks cant go bankrupt and banks are insured.  If a bank has problems then you its account balances would also be traded with a discount


if you signed that paper and you have widely accepted credibility then i would be able to use it as a currency.


well, banks mainly make money by lending out money. They calculate that X% go bankrupt and try to offset it with their interest profits. If a global recession causes a lot of people to default then some banks gonna have a problem, that's true. That's also the reason why bank accounts are insured and also shows that banks aren't some magical institution that aren't bound to rules like normal companies.

but it seems like that you need an economics degree to understand that "creating money" is nothing special. Everyone can do it by just borrowing or lending money.
Even with bitcoin, there still will be banks, there still will be demand for borrowing and lending money and people (especially banks) will be able to lend more then they actually have (fractional reserve). It has been done with gold and is probably as old as humanity itself...


"the system" won't collapse due to any of this but it will due to huge amount of stupidity that can lead to very bad results in a democracy.

Imagine there's just one bank and one person, Joe. Bank creates $100, loans it to joe at 5% interest. There is only $100 of money in the economy. Joe cannot pay back the interest because the money to pay it back DOES NOT EXIST! Where is he supposed to get $105 when there is only $100 in existence?
if there is just on person and a bank then Joe has to own the bank and essentially owns the money himself :). 


why is it so hard to understand that the profits a bank makes by lendin gout money flow back to the economy through salaries and dividends? and that's where the borrower can earn that additional 5%.

you don't need physical assets to pay all the liabilities outstanding. I feel like people have no clue how banks even work. Why do you think banks pay you interest for depositing money? because you literally lend them money that turns into the bank's assets.


that's how banks make money. The debt claims are their assets and calculate that the interest rates cancel out people defaulting so they make a profit.

"Civil liberties or personal freedoms are personal guarantees and freedoms that the government cannot abridge, either by law or by judicial interpretation, without due process. Though the scope of the term differs between countries, civil liberties may include the freedom of conscience, freedom of press, freedom of religion, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, the right to security and liberty, freedom of speech, the right to privacy, the right to equal treatment under the law and due process, the right to a fair trial, and the right to life.

if the price drops then it does not store the value you put in. Simple. Gold has less volcity and a much more certain future making it a better store of value. 


metal is much more predictable than bitcoin. If I buy gold I KNOW that I never will get a total loss while bitcoin could be worth nothing next year...


fiat is the prime example of a store of value you can read up in any economics book. Go educate yourself.

page 487 for the predictability part with hyperinflating money as an example: "[...] uncertainty about the future value [...] reduces its ability to serve as a reliable store of value [...] "

the fed bought assets (bonds) through market operations. That's not "stealing"
"Through open market operations, a central bank influences the money supply in an economy. Each time it buys securities (such as a government bond or treasury bill), it in effect creates money. The central bank exchanges money for the security, increasing the money supply while lowering the supply of the specific security. Conversely, selling of securities by the central bank reduces the money supply."
@_date: 2018-07-12 15:30:13

see above. Deflation would also mean they will get their paychecks cut or get laid off. So they would not be able to save more.




that a poor individual with no securities has to pay higher interest rates is a no-brainer. the point is that deflation will increase the interest rates even further and the debt/wealth ratio is just much higher for poor people compared to rich ones... and the rich ones are also the ones lending money to the poor with extortionate rates of interest in a deflation.

why do you keep thinking in physical froms? Everyone can create money out of thin air just by borrowing it. One has the physical cash while the other one has the liability as an asset. Both are essentially worth the same. 
In your gold coin example: with only 2 people (borrower and lender) the only way for the borrower is to produce goods and services that the lender wants to buy.
And the lender can only buy these things from the borrower by either paying more coins or relieving the debt. In the later case, the lender basically pays the borrower with his own IOU.


like real money, you could also create bitcoins out of thin air by borrowing or lending them... its already done in exchanges where people basically trading bitcoin IOUs with each other. No physical bitcoin is moving an inch there and only when people want to withdraw then there is some physical movement.
In the end, these made up bitcoins on an exchanged only backed by a promise are as much worth as real physical bitcoins and i could use both to buy stuff with.


even if people going to default it still is a zero-sum game since defaulting cancels the debt.

@_date: 2018-07-12 13:50:26


not really. You example mostly refers to banks since normal companies don't lend money and the debt you can provide as security gets smaller with each lending.


is the money the bank holds for you, not a real asset?
are your retirement or pension funds not a real asset?
that probably makes up the most of the 247 trillion debt...
@_date: 2018-04-03 13:51:46

because you are making the circles. I told you for the 3rd time that this interest money flows back in the economy
As Example:
Bank borrows 100$ from the Central bank with 1$ interest. The central bank can directly hand out the 1$ to the government.
the bank lends these $100 with $5 interest to a person. The bank can credit the 5$ of their employees or shareholders right away.
Now $106 are in the economy (money + credit). The guy who borrowed these 100$ has to earn the money from the government ($1) and the bank employees ($5) in order to pay the loan with the interest back.

why would an individual consumer care about the producer? They buy an iPhone because they want one to play the new games or use the newest features on them. If Apple suddenly just releases phones the consumer doesn't like then they would go bankrupt. So apple and other companies have to bring better phones every year which is a huge incentive for being innovative.

that's bs. Poor people don't have much money that would be affected by inflation / deflation and usually live from paycheck to paycheck that usually gets adjusted to the inflation.
Rich people, on the other hand, would profit big time from a deflation. They could just sit on their money and get richer every day bo doing nothing at all... they don't even need to lend out or invest their money giving other people a chance to climb up the laddder.


the inflation for the EU is projected to be 1.1% which is way below the 2% target.

I don't get how you could claim that inflation hits poor people harder than rich ones... really poor people don't even have savings and live from paycheck to paycheck that usually gets adjusted to inflations every year.
Also the poor and middle class are the ones who have the most debt that they took to buy a home or a car... 
if there would be a deflation then rich people would get richer every day just by sitting on their pile of money while poor people would have to pay huge interest rates to get a loan.

but no one will want bitcoin... currently, almost every mid size+ company that "accepts bitcoin" gets fiat through payment processors like bitpay. There is not much you buy directly with bitcoins and even less if these shops cant pay their suppliers with bitcoin and cant exchange it into fiat.

the whole point is that you should NOT sit on a stash of dollars. You are supposed to invest, consume or lend it.

that's simply not true. interest payed doesn't disappear, that interest is still a part of the money supply. interest doesn't increase debt indefinitely, it flows through the system. 
You simply did not understand how Fractional reserve, central banks, and commercial banks work and just fell for pseudo science...

what's such a scam about fractional reserve banking?

reading the comments for sure sounds like we are on the [delusion stage](
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:04:00
that's true as well
that's why there are efforts to reduce the amount of cash floating around.
Also, cryptocurrencies make it really easy to launder money in comparison.

newspapers are now reporting on the huge price increase on bitcoin again.
expect a crash soon...
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:55:02
they kinda have a point.
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are mostly used for shady business practices outside of speculation. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 18:42:42
why are people still falling for this conspiracy bullshit? 
@_date: 2017-06-13 19:02:22
yeah, everything is a conspiracy and we are controlled by some unknown force...
the video is full of lies so they they can deceive people into buying gold from them. Nothing more...
