Hahaha musical chairs indeed

Do you really believe it’s victimless to be a drug dealer, particularly kingpin level?  I’m afraid people here are sheltered and/or brainwashed.  Most folks in society don’t consider drug commerce to be victimless crimes.  Most folks won’t adopt BTC either, not given the current fundamentals.
The problem is that most people live in a bubble, and apply that to their worldview and moral structure.  Illegal drugs cause suffering in America.  For every person you know that manages their hard drug habit, there is at least one more for whom it’s a serious medical issue. Dealing enables these folks and causes suffering.
Like it or not, blind legalization isn’t anywhere near the ideal solution in a country like America where you can find all ranges of subcultures and ideals. Some of these subcultures are a horrible match for legalized drugs and of course are affected by easily access to illegal drugs.

Eventually right? Bwhahahahaha!
Should have used a stop loss.  You don’t know if it’ll ever recover to your 7700 cost basis.
Basic game theory: If many participants can only go long and don’t use stop losses, what direction causes them the most pain?
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:43:48
Bwahahahahahaha 
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:14:39
Why delete my post? Too much good info.
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:02:06
See there you go, an action plan to get out at decent prices.
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:54:05
You’re free to make presumptions as to my chromosomal configuration, especially while price tanks and reality of unrealized gains sets in.
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:42:45
I don’t give a fuck about bcash
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:03:42
Hahahahaha!!! Wahhhhh!!! Poor guy!!
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:06:32
Not about me pal, I’m sacrificing for YOU. This is about you.
@_date: 2017-10-24 07:00:58
That’s dark.  Does your mother approve of such language?
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:28:24
Hahahahaha!!! Go back to your piker life!! If we see moon, you’ll still be poor.
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:37:30
Hodl short BTC 
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:19:50
Hahaha you’re a tool!!  You probably had no coin to sell anyway.
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:31:31
It’s at $5900 per 1BTC.  I recommend selling everything now.
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:45:33
What do any of your ramblings have to do with how you give unsound and potentially harmful/empty advice to other folks who may actually follow your advice?  You’re biased and pushing your non-plan on others at an inopportune time.
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:09:43
Too bad it might not come. Buyers would need to push it higher again to get out in 5900s... no assurance of that
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:12:35
None of that changes the fact that Ross was running a criminal enterprise.
Your voice hurts the BTC cause.  Fringe views will keep it from becoming mainstream.
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:45:51
That’s right keep buying up, doesn’t matter if it breaks to new highs, this is noise before the boom boom pow.
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:29:57
Throwaway account following BTC since lot longer than u pal
Listen to me.
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:53:09
Bwhahahahaha, douchebag vs alien weirdo... only on reddit!
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:29:57
Maybe you’ll get a bounce to USD $5750-5800 now.  I wouldn’t count on it.
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:16:34
And you’re bringing what info exactly? I said sell while it’s still above 5900.  You’re telling people to just hold even if their investment goes south.  Just plain irresponsible.  And that tone of yours, oh my.
You have no questions for me that don’t have obvious answers to casual observers with a modicum of intelligence.  It’s obvious to the objective observer that I’m right and you’re wrong, and not just about the trade/investment thesis.
If you hadn’t been giving irresponsible advice at the worst possible time, I wouldn’t have resorted to coming down on you.  It’s just that you’re possibly hurting others with your advice.
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:35:06
Let’s see, just took a glance at your posts.  You’ve been spouting useless bullshit here long term.
You’re doing God’s work, son. God bless you.
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:27:45
It’s at $5650 now maybe you get bounce to $5750-5800.  Maybe.  I wouldn’t count on it.
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:56:04
This isn’t about me pal it’s about you and your unrealized gains
If I’m right then I helped you
If I’m wrong you could learn to hedge at least which isn’t on most people’s radar screens, no insurance will amplify the volatility during the musical chair sell off 
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:30:33
He was a criminal kingpin.
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:35:33
No they listen to me
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:59:13
Sell 5900 5925 5950 5975
@_date: 2017-10-24 07:26:18
You’re demonstrating quite a high degree of intellect by using the phrase ‘it is what it is’.  Such a phrase truly does convey quite a bit of useful information to help drive our conversation forward.
If you’re right and we see moon do you really think I’m going to miss out on it? Hahaha!!
My throwaway handle says too late for 2017.... what if I am right? I’m safe and you’re not.
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:40:51
It could be at new highs and I’ll be fine.  That’s the part you pikers don’t get.  You could be very right or wrong and it’ll involve no skill, just luck good or bad.  That’s what makes your advice dangerous.
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:02:37
Kudos on your random irrelevant babbling.
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:04:18
Holy fuck, no wonder BTC is fringe.
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:43:08
On my fone, not logged into my long term Reddit acct 
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:42:24
The proof is that it will drop hard okay?
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:03:07
Just be grateful you’re getting good info. I’m sacrificing a lot doing this courtesy for you.
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:25:18
It means your worldview doesn’t fit with the majority.
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:50:14
What the fuck does alcohol have to do with what we’re talking about?  This place has some real college graduates.
@_date: 2017-10-24 07:16:37
Probably since his crimes were considered particularly horrendous.
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:51:56
Yes it’s okay because no one else is going to let you into the club not even if CNBC throws it in your face
It’s a game and the talking heads simply need to be right 50% of the time to extract money... yet they understand when and how to reverse their psychology depending on conditions... data said it’s safe to tell public the truth without killing insider profits 
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:01:58
Did you do nothing?  How did we do? Oh right never saw 5900 again.
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:52:53
Yes peeps listen because price will fall during sell off
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:29:55
Hehehe :) good work!!! Bwhahahahaa!!!  Piker indeed.
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:57:22
Spend your coin, laddie! Bwhahahahaa!!!
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:05:05
Your support has zero to do with the coming sell off and how that will affect the value of your holdings.  Market is greater than all.
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:15:31
Hahahahaha you’re dumb... this doesn’t tell you how many sellers there are during the decline!!!
No short covering rallies!!!!  Whahahahahaha ahwhahahahaha awaaa!!!! You don’t even know what that means nor why it matters!!!
Pikers, lol, you were instructed by weird aliens to sell at 6k, was your antenna broken? Bwhahahahaha!!!!
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:47:51
Proof is in the ledger pal
Algos already concluded time to sell
Humans catching up
Top traders snipe the top
Rest of the followers sell on the dead cat bounce that happened already
Any questions?
@_date: 2017-10-24 07:28:09
You’re in good company here with your libertarian pals, but you’re not going to seriously spout bullshit without getting called out.
However, you and the community bore me, because nobody with a loud voice here cares to consider viewpoints other than the self perpetuated echo chamber madness.  So I’ll pass on engaging you.  Btc is in play after all.
Website, heh.  Good one.
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:26:34
You seriously have no plan to address a bear market, do you?  Geez man at least don’t drag others down.  And wow, your tone with me.  Although fopdoodle did make me laugh, which is ironic coming from the no-plan-but-hold power duo.
The real issue here is the future price of BTC, not your insults.  The thing could tank so hard and fast that it’ll make your head spin.  You’ve been warned.  
Yeah, I’m going to tell you or rocky all of my tricks and sources.  Right.  Be grateful you have someone who cares enough to share their experience with some souls on the internet.  You can lead a horse to water..
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:06:35
I asked you a question, boy.
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:55:34
Bwahahahaha another no-plan piker! Price is falling now and you’re defensive.  I understand, hot cakes.
You had alien weirdos here advising you to sell for days here.. you didn’t research this and have given back gains.  It’s not fun.  Seriously. All kidding aside.  But then again I did try to share the peace pipe..
Why do you believe I’m short, btw? I said sell.  Sure, savvy traders shorted high and are sitting on a possible “early adopter” short play.
So, I take it you plan to hold here with no strategy to reduce size at all, eh?
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:36:41
Cited to the ether, okay?
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:33:00
Dude I don’t have to. You’ve been on here trolling for a long time.
Yeah, never heard of DK.  Only on reddit...
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:46:36
If you say so, hahaha.  Bcash is a joke technology
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:38:17
You’ll look back and be like whoa it broke 5900 never looked back not this year pal
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:34:14
Fortunately a couple 100k satoshis won’t affect your future.
