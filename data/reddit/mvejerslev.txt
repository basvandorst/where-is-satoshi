My favourite moment in bitcoin 2015 was when you decided to ignore that I probably dont have 80+ link karma yet (working on it), but still decided I was a good boy this year. Merry christmas either way!

You gotta wonder what motivated such a sellout. Especially in these times. Like any other bitcoin time.

I cant help but think the current surge / daily transactions are primarily driven by the MMM ponzi...

MMM ponzi scheme is using bitcoin only and operates in numerous countries

Pretty genious to sell all your coin, scorn it, then buy back on the low.

Lol me too. Had just send a nice chunk there for the first time (still confirming), and the whole site just went *puff*

Here's a thought. Its just debt transfer from one fantasy value to another fantasy value. As long as we keep reinventing and putting value into new nothings, when the previous one bursts, we can keep this capitalistic suicide system going.
