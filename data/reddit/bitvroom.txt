I did a reverse image search but I have not found any other sites using this image.

great, nice work! Is it possible to add support for addresses?

installed coinbase app for price alerts -&gt; registration required -&gt; price alerts not working -&gt; app deleted -&gt; will not use coinbase again

Will we see a PoW change as last option to fight off this shit? Let's brick these ASICs and ruin bitmain and co.

is not deflation also a bit threat for a currency? if the value of a currency is increasing all the time, people don't use the currency to purchase stuff and start HODLing it. can not lead this to some kind of spiral? more value, more HODLers, until no coin is circulating anymore?
best example is the 10000 bitcoin pizza. this story is the source of all HODLers.

thanks for sharing!
where do we get a list of valid user agents? I found a "Statoshi:0.15.99" connected to my node and added "Statoshi" to my blacklist:
Fri Sep 29 10:39:56 2017: banning Statoshi:0.15.99/ (46.226.111.23)

such a bunch of assholes

I recommend to also run this script:

this in different languages would be nice.
@_date: 2017-09-30 07:52:38
thanks, I googled for statoshi and unbanned them.
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:09:56
I have my own ban script and I also ban these useragents: 'Bitcoin ABC', 'BitcoinUnlimited' and 'BUCash'.

very optimistic if you think that coinbase alerts work. I already removed this app because alerts are not working.

Nice work. Can you share your project on github?

At least he does not show his own face
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:55:29
that would be awesone. meanwhile I found this site for segwit addresses but I don't know how safe it is: 
use it at your own risk
