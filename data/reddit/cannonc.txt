I have an idea of a solution for


We should keep addresses as this is how bitcoin works and gives anonymity since we dont know who is behind addresses. 
**Stage 1**
 Have wallets/apps integrate internal address book that link to an entity's xpub or stealth address, so that way there is just the need to add a person into your wallet/apps address book once, and each transaction would still use unique bitcoin addresses for each transaction.
**Stage 2**
Integrate blockstack or namecoin with these wallets so our crypto identities can also be used as an option for sending and receiving bitcoin.

Hello luke-jr !
I am not suggesting we re-invent the wheel, just asking for thoughts of what type of system would be best for acting as an archive of data to survive disasters, wars, takedowns and censorship. Basically to preserve our technological advancement and to assure it's survival in the face of a disaster or scenario mentioned. I am thinking some sort of P2P protocol for the distributed information archive, then as OSI layer 1 physical P2P meshnet networks are grown the distributed data repository would then have even greater strength in terms of survival if internet is shutdown.
Your comment bring BlockStack to mind....
My plan of action I have in mind:
1 Decide on best secure, verifiable, P2P file sharing/storage protocol. (blockstack? torrent? IPFS? Zeronet? One or more of these?)
2 Backup data to this, such as source code of various programs, essential barebone linux distros, whitepapers, etc.... 
3 Start promoting the growth of meshnet networks ( ? ) so this repository along with our P2P systems (such as bitcoin) can survive even on the physical layer.

You do not own your bitcoins if you keep them on a website.

Ross is not responsible for the actions of the merchants and buyers whom might have done something illegal, because SilkRoad was in an international domain (cyberspace) and globally accessible, the actions and legality was at the responsibility of each individual user based upon their physical jurisdiction. Everything is legal in some nations, yet illegal in others. Also, Ross is not responsible for anyone whom might have overdosed. Those whom would think otherwise are same kinds of people whom refuse to acknowledge that we are responsible for our own actions. If I buy a bottle of vodka then drink the entire bottle in one hour, is it not my fault that I was irresponsible? Or is it the fault of the store where I bought that vodka? I drink, but never am I drunk. Because I am responsible. If I get drunk and do something stupid or get harmed as a result it is my fault and no one elses. 
Ross is a hero, he was a pioneer in using technology to promote free trade and a free market system to promote a good economy. He is a political prisoner and victim of oppressive governments because his vision, the vision of liberty, was a threat to government control. 
Just for the record I am not for drugs, I believe drugs are bad for the body. But that is why I choose to not do drugs. We are individually responsible for what our free will allows, not the market.

What if no one in the group of family or very close friends know who the other shareholders are? But if something happens to the person that has the bitcoins then the family and friends would then start asking each other if they are a shareholder, the minimum number of shareholders needed to unlock funds would have to discover each other. Or could have a protocol for the shareholders to discover each other.
But even if shareholders knew who the other shareholders were, then you still would need majority of your trusted family and close friends to betray you to prematurely unlock funds.

The definition of criminal activity is defined as what is approved of by those in power, and legality defined by whomever wields control by force (governments). The boundaries of legality is not always parallel with those of ethics. People have a right to protect their property from theft, even if that theft is considered "legal" by the thief.

Also before it goes "mainstream" it needs to be more assured and secured from regulation. As soon as it becomes mainstream governments will try to control it or shut it down. How we can achieve this enhanced assurance from such adversaries is to promote more nodes, survival of the network by linking it to a censorship proof physical network (we need more Tor nodes, better yet... I2P nodes) and maybe even physical meshnetworking and enhancing privacy features while refusing to implement AML/KYC features.

Another argument against the writer of this anti-liberty article, the author is citing the potential for bad people to abuse such technology. However this author fails to realize that the abuse of power by governments is as equal of a threat and potentially even more dangerous, than the abuse of technology by a few bad people. History can back up my claims well, when bad people use governments or *when* those governments become corrupt (as they often have throughout history) they have abused the technology and power at their disposal to harm alot of people. Whereas the other end of the spectrum, where abuse of technology by bad people are not of governments, are often in areas where the general population has been disarmed and deprived of (through governments), the very same technology that the bad people are using against the general population which has been made defenseless.
Liberty is power, and protection from abuse of power at the same time. With great power comes great responsibility. Centralization of power mostly leads to corruption, decentralization of power greatly safeguards corruption from being too centralized or powerful. Liberty is that decentralization of power, and the means for the majority to defend themselves against the corrupt minority.

This is why you should always use a fake identity or a pseudonym anytime you operate a business or run a project, to protect yourself from malicious adversaries that have corrupted and infiltrated the legal system for protection and power. If the developer would have ran the project anonymously or "releases control and hands over" the project to "someone else" that happens to be anonymous and operating under a pseudonym he can then keep himself safe.

The title **Bitcoin and international crime** is the one of this article.
Beyond the universal law of man, the word "crime" is defined as what is against the approval of the one that has the luxury to define what is and is not crime. It is often times oppressors that have this very luxury and use it against the consent of the governed to define "crime" as that which threatens that oppressors centralization on power. What is a crime against liberty and the people is often times considered justified by the tyrant. Whereas the opposite in which that what often guards liberty is often times considered a crime by the one whom holds the luxury of defining law.
The only "crime" that crypto can be accused of, is of guarding the liberties of people. Yet that defining term of crime used in such a context is only a crime to the tyrants and none other.

The ultimate plan is to create, advance, and expand crypto technologies to the point that power hungry and oppressive governments ease to exist due to their irrelevancy as their power diminishes as it is replaced by fair and incorruptible systems that cyrpto technology has to offer.
 I alluded to this plan in one of my former writings "Dawn of the Crypto Age" which can be found with a search query. Thus informs the true agenda behind the crypto wars, it is not about public safety but about oppressors maintaining a grasp on power.  For the cypherpunk revolution to triumph though, it requires people to be informed on the advantages and importance of crypto, for others to pursue the advancement of this technology and widespread use, and to be brave enough to refuse to comply with angry governments. Then.... liberty shall be ever more secured by this technology far into the future.

With crypto I can have my funds secured in a multisig account, airgapped, or hardware wallet accessible anywhere in the world at anytime with near instant transactions. Free from taxation and confiscation. I can cross borders with no limitations on transfer of wealth, even borders themselves become irrelevant as I send transactions and receive deposits. All unreported and invisible to the surveillance grid with the help of mixing protocols. I can have multiple encrypted backups of my wallet in multiple locations in case one location gets compromised. I am my own bank, linked with the new secure and decentralized global financial network built upon the cypherpunk vision.

Ignorance is the hallmark of government.
It is okay for someone to have an opinion, but the problem is when the people trying to tell everyone how to live has no idea what they are talking about.
The Commerce Department is incorrect in many things it is saying...
example "Investing in Bitcoin, he said, is not like investing in silver and gold, which are backed by the federal government."
Silver and gold are **not** backed by the federal government. Silver and gold is a universal commodity that is not reliant on backing by the governments fiat monopoly money.
The problem is that government agencies, whom have alot of influence on the image of bitcoin to the general sheepish population (since gullible people take government agencies seriously) are spreading complete fallacies, apparent by their own ignorance.

Problem with debit cards is that they have no authentication mechanism. At least here in the US, anyone with the card number can use that card number to buy anything with it. Incredibly stupid, just like our identity system, (the only thing needed to steal someones identity is their SSN number, which is the same number that is given out to everyone as your identifier).

Bitcoin-QT is a wallet, Armory is a wallet also with Bitcoin-QT as a dependency, difference is that Armory adds features (usually security focused) and functionality that is not otherwise included in just Bitcoin-QT alone. 
To take advantage of Armory's split wallet (consisting of one online and one offline computer) requires two devices. If you do not have two devices to do this, another option I would recommend would be to use a live disc  that you could use for bitcoin purposes only so that you would be kept safe from any potential malware on your primary computer operating system. One way you could do this, is using a persistent TAILS USB for bitcoin wallet purposes only. TAILS has a great bitcoin client known as Electrum built into it that does not require the full blockchain like Bitcoin-QT and Armory. 
The recommendations and ideas I have presented is just what I would do if I was really concerned about security. You could just simply use a bitcoin client on your primary computer operating system, though you do risk it being stolen if compromised by malware, even if encrypted wallet the malware could use keylogger to steal bitcoin.

The point is to comply when being robbed to hand over your wallet or bitcoin to the thief, then pull your gun out to shoot them down as they take off with your stolen item or money. After shooting them you recover your stolen item, take their gun and continue on your way. You now have your stolen property back, a dead culprit and now a new gun for free.

For offline wallet, Armory is what I opt to be the best.  
It allows you to sign transactions on your offline computer, then to send the transactions signed on your online computer.
Most secure and advanced wallet available.
Tips: If want most security do not use Windows or Mac OSX ever on your airgapped computer. Use Linux or Unix.
 2nd, do not use USB to transfer files between airgapped computer and main computer since USB can infect computers (BadUSB). I suggest either re-writable CD, or even better display QR code on screen of air-gapped computer and transfer to internet connected devices via camera.
3rd Have your offline computer hidden to protect from evil maid attack of modification of hardware or software.
4th Also have encrypted paper backups of your wallet, either BIP38 encrypted paper wallets or fragmented paper backups.
Another option that is really user friendly is a Trezor if you have money aside to buy one. They are about 100 if use coupon code letstalkbitcoin.com or $119 otherwise. Might be a good investment if have more than this in value of bitcoin.
Another option if want long term storage is to store the bitcoin on encrypted paper wallet with offsite backups. Check out bitcoinpaperwallet.com just be sure to run offline and on live disc to protect yourself from any potential malware on your computer.
I will clarify or go more detailed if need be.

There is use. Every single GH collectively aimed at Bitcoin mining helps keep mining decentralized. 30 GH is not much alone, but collectively amounts to alot. Even if just half of bitcoin users were running 30 GHs along with a full node in their home Bitcoin would be even more decentralized. These days with the improfitability of Bitcoin mining, you mine for the interest of Bitcoins security, not for profit (unless you are one of those monopolized mining companies). Though you get no direct profit financially from mining, in a way you do as this security in decentralization is helping to contribute to the security of your crypto wealth. 
The only thing would be to have miner that is efficient so that even if you do not profit off it, you could contribute to the network without much loss as a result of electricity use.
If you have no purpose for it, I'll gladly take it (and cover shipping) to run it to help out the Bitcoin network.

The payment card system doesn't work. All one needs to steal your money is your card number. Payment cards have no authentication (at least in US). Wheras crypto can only be spent if authenticated cryptographically with use of asymmetric public key cryptology.

Crypto currencies when properly applied are anonymous unlike payment cards that track my location and everything I buy.

I have seen comments below mentioning use of a lawyer. You can't trust a 3rd party with your entire private key, what if that lawyer goes rough or his information you trusted him with leaks? If using a lawyer safe route to go would be to give the lawyer only a partial share of the key using Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme, in which the key can not be constructed unless combined with the share/s of the other trusted party/s.
And be sure to have a backup of the key yourself encrypted and kept safe.

This is what I do...
I have my funds distributed amongst paper wallets being that offline paper wallets are safer than storing on computer.
I have the paper wallets encrypted with BIP38.
I also have multiple copies of the paper wallets in multiple locations.
I then have the passcode to my BIP38 encrypted paper wallets divided amonst trustees in my family using Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme. 
With this setup, if wallet gets stolen, I am safe as it is encrypted, and buys me lots of time to move funds to new wallet. If a natural disaster wipes out one location and causes paper wallets to get destroyed, I still have other backups in other sites. In case something happens to me, I have trustees that can uncover the funds by combining their shares to reveal the key to the funds of my paper wallets. Using Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme. With Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme, you can make it to where the key can be recovered when a certain threshold is met, such as when 3 of 5 trustees putting their shares together.
As for not spending until 10 years, for that you would need self discipline.

1st Dont use windoze and this wouldn't be a problem. Not saying that just simply using Linux would solve this, but I have NEVER seen anything but windoze affected by ransomware. Linux is also generally more secure anyways.
2nd Why would people ever not use webrowser in a sandbox? Using a web browser un-sandboxed is like running through a war zone naked with no armor screaming "please shoot me" through a megaphone. If you absolutely refuse to sandbox your shit, at the very least disable scripts as a default with whitelisting only sites that you absolutely need to use scripts with.
3rd Please make backups of your stuff.
As for the ransomware, wish I could help out with this, though unfortunately only way to get files back if do not have a backup is to pay. The thing about security is that it is proactive, not reactive.

What value backs up gold? Just like gold, bitcoin is directly of itself a store of value because global consensus agree to use it as a token of monetary purpose.


Bitcoin is a decentralized protocol not controlled by any single entity, this decentralized protocol has hardcoded rules such as a cap on supply of how many bitcoins can ever exist (21 million bitcoin) and the rate of which they are issued. Even though there will ever only be around 21 million bitcoins to ever exist, each bitcoin is divisible currently up to 8 decimal places.

For using large amounts of bitcoin, is is always best to use a wallet that you are in control of in lieu of a webwallet that others control.
**My Recommendations For Wallet Options**
*Electrum*  
*Multibit* 
are both great wallets where you control all your bitcoins. For enhanced privacy if needed,  Electrum can also be used behind Tor. (Multibit can be used behind Tor with manual configuration, though as far as I know Multibit does not have user interface support for Tor like Electrum does). If Tor is also desirable could also check out TAILS live system at tails.boum.org which is bootable OS that has Electrum included, in which everything done is behind Tor at the system level.
Electrum will give you more features, Multibit is more simplistic and great for being user friendly.
**Physical Hardware Wallet**
*Trezor* If need heightened security such as if dealing with large amounts of wealth I would recommend a Trezor hardware wallet available from bitcointrezor.com . With Trezor being a hardware wallet, your private keys which allow access to your bitcoin never touch the computer, so if your computer has malware it cannot steal your bitcoin.
 Trezor also works with both Electrum and Multibit. Trezor also interfaces with mytrezor.com online wallet, though unlike other webwallets this webwallet cannot steal your funds since the private keys never leave your Trezor.
**Using Bitcoin securely with Electrum's Airgap Feature**
If concerned about storing wallet on a computer that might have malware you can use Electrum in airgap mode. What this means is that with Electrum you can have an Electrum wallet on your main computer that is connected to internet, and your funds on a 2nd Electrum wallet that is on a computer or bootable OS that is kept offline. Whenever you want to send funds you would go to the Electrum wallet that is holding the keys and kept offline to create the transaction, you would then copy the signed transaction to your main computer that is online.  Could use 2 bootable TAILS for this setup also, just be sure to never let the 'airgap' one touch the network. In this airgap setup it is less convenient, but great security. If want high security and high convenience then Trezor is way to go.
Multibit and Electrum are great wallets.
For better security use Electrum with 'airgap' feature
For best secuirty and convenience I recommend Trezor hardware wallet

Many reasons to use bitcoin in the first place
*  Can earn an anonymous income
*  Can send money and purchase anonymously with use of Tor, I2P, Bitcoin mixers.
*  Can move money unregulated and circumvent government taxes and government surviellance such as KYC and AML laws.
*  Using electronic payment system that is secure unlike debit or credit cards (and no not even the chip and pin is secure)
*  You are in control of your money, no one else. This means no one can confiscate it from you either. Nor can your funds be stolen if you use it correctly
*  A non-fiat system unlike the dollar
*  I can send money anywhere in the world effortlessly quickly for very low cost without a middle man.
*  I can have multiple encrypted backups of my money, a secure store of value.
* Can utilize multiple protocols that are not offered in any other current payment system, such as watch only deterministic addresses which could be used by shops to prevent cashier theft. 
* Multisig to have funds that are controlled securely by multiple people that cannot be stolen by one person.
* Many more......

Cold storage means a wallet that is not on a device that connects to any internet or network. Very hard to hack a device that is not connected to any network.
Hot wallet is a wallet on a internet connected device.
The idea is that most of your bitcoins should be kept safe in cold storage, and just little bit of bitcoins for paying bills and daily used are in "hot wallet", or a wallet that is on a internet connected device. Then send funds to hot wallet from cold wallet as needed.
The nice thing about hardware wallets is you have the convenience of hot wallets, with the security of cold wallets.
One option could be to use TAILS  on bootable USB drive and use the built in bitcoin wallet electrum. This is nice because TAILS is trusted, electrum has offline "cold storage" capability, and TAILS when using persistence is fully encrypted plus you can boot from the TAILS USB drive on any computer. Just be sure to copy down your 12 word electrum recovery seed onto paper so you dont risk losing money if data becomes corrupted. And if using the TAILS USB drive for cold storage dont connect to internet with it.
Of course this is not only option for cold storage, but it is a safe and easy one.
But do consider getting a Trezor (Trezor also works nicely with electrum). Trezor also works great with mycelium bitcoin wallet for smartphones.
This is what I use is Trezor with electrum. But for privacy I also run my own electrum server on a .onion Tor address.
Like electrum has word seed recovery, so does Trezor. Might find interest in CryptoSteel for long term seed recovery storage. Of course paper is fine, but cryptosteel is very neat.
Other than TAILS, another cold storage option is 
If use bitcoinpaperwallet.com be sure to generate the wallets offline. That site also sells a live disc for making wallets offline. I've done business with Canton Becker of that website, he has a good reputation.

Bitcoin wallets store private keys which are used to spend your bitcoins. Anyone with your private key can spend your bitcoin, this is why you should keep that private key secret and secure.
You only truly own your bitcoin when you have the private key and no one else. This is why you should create your paper wallets yourself
What paper wallets do is store your private key physically on paper. This is known as cold storage, since the keys are not stored on a computer, the idea is that so long as your physical cold storage (in this case paper wallet) is kept safe, your bitcoins cannot be hacked since it is offline. For paper wallets I recommend

If you dont have sole control over your keys, you dont own the bitcoin.
Whatever wallet you use, be sure to backup the wallet seed. Also avoid the countless fake wallets on app stores. Verify the legitimacy before downloading, and verify integrity of your downloads before installing anything preferably by checking the gpg signatures.
I would recommend researching the technical side of bitcoin to appreciate what it is but to also allow you to have more control and make correct decisions in how you use and store it.

I respect you for wanting to run a node. 
I run my dedicated node on a pre-owned laptop I bought for around $150. 
Almost anything will do, it might take anywhere from up to 24 hours to couple days to sync from genesis block but after that you are good. 
If running a node please allow the port to be open on your router or firewall.
As for OS, I personally like Debian linux (starting to look into switching to OpenBSD).  But anything other than Windows or OSX should serve you well.
Just keep in mind that if you are running a full node with full blockchain without pruning be sure to have a large harddrive as the blockchain is currently around 100 GB. With a large harddrive you will be future proof.
And bitcoin core is what would want to run as it is consensus compatible and not hardfork like Classic or BU. I run my bitcoin node full command line, however bitcoin core also has a gui if not comfortable with command line.
With whatever OS or distro you chose, and when download your bitcoin software (whether you compile from source, or use pre-packaged binaries) will want to verify the integrity of it by checking the GPG signatures.

You dont even need 3G to send payment. Just use the camera to scan the QR code of transaction request, sign it on device and display the signed transaction as QR code on the device screen.
Would work like this:
* Merchant displays QR code payment request
* You scan QR code and sign TX which then displays the singed TX as QR code on screen of your device.
* Merchant scans your QR code and their POS broadcasts the tx.

I was assuming that if we needed the capacity to do all transactions on chain we would need to be able to process the same amount of TPS (transactions per second) as Visa, which is claimed to be around 10,000 tps. Bitcoin to be able to do 10,000 tps by only increasing the blocksize would require blocks to be 1.4 GB each which would bring the blockchain growth to around 73-75 TB per year assuming my math is correct.
1.4 GB blocks * 6 blocks per hour * 24 hours per day * 365 days a year = 73 TB

For distributed networks such as Tor, I2P, or bitcoin these closed source operating systems are harmful due to their security flaws, potential backdoors, and lack of openess and user control. Windows is loaded with Microsoft spyware, insecure, and lacks even the very basic features that are required for a functioning system, does not even come with tools to verify hashes or PGP fingerprints, or for ssh just to name a couple.

That was before I dived into bitcoin. Perhaps people whom were around at the time can chime in on why it was limited to begin with, and why increased.

Lets call whatever phone, computer, tablet etc.. that you use for charging bitcoin the "PoS system".
If you want to have employees be able to charge bitcoin without having access to your private keys, some wallets have feature where you can keep private keys seperate from the PoS system. The PoS system would only store a copy of the bitcoin addresses they can send payment to.
Most wallets these days use what is called an hierarchical deterministic wallet which means that it would create a unique bitcoin address for each bill all derived from the single private key that you have control over.

I believe drugs are bad, that is why I choose not to do them and accept personal responsibility for my actions, those whom blame the market for abusive drug usage are immature and the same people whom refuse to accept personal responsibility. No, Ross did not ruin your drug addict kids life, your kid you failed to raise properly killed himself, your kids own actions are your kids own fault not Ross so shut up and stop trying to blame others.
The reason Ross was targeted is because he and his ideas of libertarian-ism and free market system was a threat to government control.

Great question.
I will try to explain. Pardon me if too technical, ask if need shortened version. Bitcoin makes use of the "blockchain" which is a distributed ledger, think of it as a "state machine", where this distributed ledger keeps track of the state of bitcoins. The things it keeps track of is amount of bitcoins, and what "addresses" own those bitcoins. This distributed ledger validates and updates the ledger on average every ten minutes.
Addresses are basically lockboxes, each lockbox can only be unlocked with certain conditions. Whenever a bitcoin transaction takes place, what is really happening is the transfer of ownership of bitcoin from one lockbox (address) to another lockbox (address). In most conditions the ability to unlock one of these lockboxes, or "addresses", to transfer ownership of bitcoins is generally signing that transaction with a private key. Although while P2PKH (pay to public key hash) is the most common of bitcoin transactions right now, there are other lockboxes such as P2SH (pay to script hash) which can be unlocked using a specific condition,  the most commonly used P2SH address is a multisignature address which requires signing (or approval) from multiple pre-selected people for a transaction to take place. There is a new advancement to bitcoin called segregated witness or "segwit" for short, which if gets activated uses P2SH addresses.
What your wallet actually holds, as others have said is not the bitcoins but rather the keys to change ownership of those bitcoin.
Basically think of the blockchain as a decentralized bank. This new decentralized bank is not controlled by any entity or government but collectively secured by thousands of computers known as miners and nodes. Your "wallet" is a client software that gives you control by allowing you to manage keys in making transactions and managing control of your balance "bitcoins" that not even the bank "the blockchain" can control or steal. 
So in a nutshell, the blockchain is the ledger, the bitcoins are the digital money or store of value, this digital record of monetary credits can only be controlled by you, not even the bank (or blockchain) can move your funds without the private key or pre-defined conditions.
*edit: changed phrase "every ten minutes" to "on average every ten minutes" for better accuracy.*

I'll try to help out.
The tx is just unconfirmed.
Next time try using RBF (replace by fee) so can up the transaction fee if gets stuck.
What wallet were you using?
For now... try re-sending the transaction but with higher fee. Because many wallets will see the unconfirmed tx and not allow you to re-send, I would recommend clearing wallet cache and signing the transaction offline (to prevent wallet from seeing the unconfirmed transaction). Then broadcast the new transaction. Can broadcast new tx here 
If using bitcoin core there is an option to "zap" the transaction which basically does what I just described, in allowing the client to disregard the unconfirmed transaction so you can re-send with higher fee. If use bitcoin core I would recommend pruning enabled so dont have to download entire blockchain. Let us know if need assistance.

Why cash out when Bitcoin is superior to USD cash? USD cash can be stolen, confiscated, taxed, lost, destroyed etc... when bitcoin is not subject to these disadvantages. 50,000 cash is also heavier to carry than a few bits of data. This is one of the reasons of bitcoin is to get around the problems presented by the current financial regulatory sector, if you convert to cash from bitcoin you are leaving the financial system that is safe from financial regulations and going into a system that is victim to the very thing you are trying to avoid. Just get a Trezor, call it good. 
If you want to convert to cash, you could advertise on localbitcoins for spot price with no markup and sell for cash so it remains unreported. Or just move out of the US to somewhere that has freedom and not worry about being raided by IRS.

In US the wealth limit is $10,000 in which after this threshold you are considered a suspect and have to file alot of paperwork to prove you are not a criminal. Wouldn't getting an account from 6 different banks, then dividing up the $50,000 amongst your 6 bank accounts all under different banks work so you are never surpassing the 10,000 in either account and thus cannot be considered structuring? Another option is to use multiple LLC each with own bank account, since LLC can be operated without revealing your name. Or you can just bypass taxes altogether by not converting to USD but rather to silver and gold bullion, I know there are some companies that sell gold silver for bitcoin. Just beware of high premiums by getting as close to spot price as possible.

Automatically use Tor hidden services
Starting with Tor version 0.2.7.1 it is possible, through Tor's control socket API, to create and destroy 'ephemeral' hidden services programmatically. Bitcoin Core has been updated to make use of this.
This means that if Tor is running (and proper authorization is available), Bitcoin Core automatically creates a hidden service to listen on, without manual configuration. Bitcoin Core will also use Tor automatically to connect to other .onion nodes if the control socket can be successfully opened. This will positively affect the number of available .onion nodes and their usage.
This new feature is enabled by default if Bitcoin Core is listening, and a connection to Tor can be made. It can be configured with the -listenonion, -torcontrol and -torpassword settings. To show verbose debugging information, pass -debug=tor.

We should stop referring to it as the "Block Size" and rather refer to it for what it is, the "Block Limit". Just because the size of that limit is raised does not mean that it will immediately go to full capacity, at least with increased limit this would prevent the network from being maxed out while potentially other long term solutions (such as side chains or lightning network) are under development. The potential hardfork, if unavoidable, if set to activate in the future will allow time for current technology to prepare for it and get on-board in advance, this is what Gavin's proposal initially was if I am correct.

The best option for both daily use and long term storage is Trezor, with Trezor you have hot wallet convenience with cold storage security. Trezor is in some way potentially even more secure than an airgap computer for cold wallet use since the key never leaves Trezor.

I know that segwit will allow miners to make more because of increased block capacity.


Not sure what you are referring to, if you are talking about lighting network, then I do not know enough yet about LN to give any accurate information on that. Maybe someone whom knows more about LN can inform if it threatens miner profits or not. 
Either way, only stopping LN is current issues with transaction malleability. I am sure there are other 2nd layer solutions in future that are not reliant on transaction malleability being fixed.
But the reason I like segwit is it allows increased block capacity, and doubles security of bitcoin P2SH from 80 bits to 160 bits of security, and will allow more scaling onchain that are unrelated to block capacity.

Banks see bitcoin as a threat to their existence. This letter only re-enforces why banks suck and crypto-currencies are better. The bank only committed suicide with this letter by making their incompetence and control of user funds apparent. By not being compatible with the future, banks are committing suicide.
Banks and governments are being phased out as a result of new protocols ran by crypto. They see crypto as a threat because of this and this is why they use media to manipulate public views and this is why they want to wage war on technology. 
Congratulations on your new status.

I guess my idea is basically in form of example, the blocktime on mars would be 10 minutes, the blocktime on Earth would be 10 minutes. However the sync time between Mars sub-chain and Earth sub-chain might be 10 hours. Assuming that while economies on their own planets need instant transactions, interplanetary transactions can wait 10 hours. 
The purpose of my idea is to allow interplanetary chain consensus and one universal digital currency, but with using sub-chains to not let this distance inhibit use of bitcoin across the galaxy since sub-chains would allow planet local economies to have normal 10 minute blocktime.

No I am no delusional. I am talking about the overall larger picture. An online ledger cannot run a country alone. Nor will governments be phased out completely, but in many aspects I believe they will be in large part as majority of functions of governments will be shifted over to distributed protocols. Crypto currencies is just one piece of the puzzle in the larger body of solutions to improve our world in keeping it safer from corruption, espionage, and manipulation by adversaries. It is a fact that governments see encryption and the solutions it offers as a threat to their power structure and threatens to make majority of their current functions as irrelevant. This is the reason governments often try to ban encryption. It is the technology that liberates people.

Bitcoin would be great inter-planetary currency. Right now we have one blockchain. I imagine in future each cluster of human colonies might have their own sub-blockchain, sub-blockchains would be necessary for non-delayed transactions at that planet. Then these sub-blockchains (one for each planet) would then sync with consensus of the other sub-blockchains from other planets thus forming the master blockchain. While majority of economic transactions take place on their own respective sub-blockchain with no sufferage of major delay, the syncing of sub-blockchains to other blockchains would be delayed by how long it takes to communicate with the other planets but this is no big deal since chain to chain syncing does not need to be instant since payments between sub-chains .  Syncing of sub-chains is neccesary for person in sub-chain A to transact with person in sub-chain B (aka Alice on mars transacts with Bob on Earth)
While delayed syncing between planets is limited by how long it takes to transmit information to that planet, slow syncing between sub-chains is better than no syncing at all and is better than economic fragmentation (since with network fragmentation I can not use Mars coin on Earth, nor Earth coin on Mars)
Presently we have a master chain which bears all transactions, made up of nodes. In future I see the master chain made up of clusters of sub-chains, much like how now the master chain is made up of a cluster of nodes. 
Maybe as civilizaion expands beyond solar system, we will have sub-sub chains. Each chain would have addresses based on its location in the chain tree which stems from master chain, much like a merkle tree except each point on the merkle tree would resemble sub-chains. So for example first octet of the chain address would be '1' to indicate the blockchain/crypto-currency aka bitcoin, octet '2' would resemble say 'milky way galaxy', octet '3' would resemble our solar system, octet '4' resembles mars. So for example a node based on earth would probably have a chain address of [1/1/1/1] (BitcoinChain/MilkyWay/SolarSystem0001/Earth)

War must be fought unconventionally these days, promote and grow use of decentralized exchanges and censorship resistant protocols to access and exchange with decentralized currencies. Then shift the economy to these crypto currencies and decentralized exchanges that are untouchable by government. As a result civillians can then starve the beast called centralized governments. The decentralized black market along with 3D printers will also grant access of firearms to freedom loving people worldwide. Starve the government controlled economy, and fuel the black economy to take power away from the oppressive governments.

Bitcoin while traceable is anonymous if used correctly. And after tumblebit gets completed, along with other anonymizing technologies such as coinjoin, bitcoin can easily mitigate traceability issues. Unlike banks, you do not need AML/KYC to send money with bitcoin. This alone makes bitcoin much better. Cash is anonymous but requires you to meet in person.


The ability to use bitcoin to bypass government control is a feature, not a bug.
As for your professor, lack of ability to understand something breeds contempt. People hate what they cannot understand or grasp. He might be very intelligent in what he teaches and understands, but he very likely understands nothing about bitcoin, and so his opinion of it is based solely on emotion rather than logic.

Well, I admit I am a libertarian. My philosophy is that the boundaries of what is right/wrong are not paralleled with what is legal/illegal. What is legal/illegal is not the definition of what is right or wrong, but rather what is approved by the one whom wields power which often many times, does things in its own interest rather than in the interest of the governed. So long as one is not doing something unethical, such as stealing or defrauding others, they are fine. I am for the free economy.

I disagree, by using plaintext internet and not using Tor you are deanonymizing your transactions. How is one deanonimized if exit node does not know who they are?
I recommend never using Bitcoin outside of Tor, as not using Tor with Bitcoin opens you up to correlation attacks as ISP and 5-eye can see who is making what payments to whom.
There is no attack or threat presented by Tor exit nodes, that do not already exist on the plain text internet. If you want real security you'd use true crypto based darknet to insure integrity and confidentiality instead of using an exit node to exit from the secure darknet into the insecure plaintext internet.

If you are referring to the cheap chinease knockoff of Trezor that is ~$30, it is poor quality, insecure, and very suspicious. I would not trust my money with it. I have a Trezor, it is worth the price for the amount of continuous R&amp;D, and software development that go into it. It is a digital vault, as with any vaults you do not want to waste your money on cheap stuff that will not stand up to the task. Vaults are nothing to skimp on, especially if that vault is storing significantly more than the cost of the vault itself.
I have done extensive research on various hardware wallets, and Trezor is by far the most secure, most flexible and best solution. I would even go as far as to say it is the perfect solution for using bitcoin in the most secure way. Hot wallet convenience with cold storage security.

Segwit is good for many reasons unrelated to scaling. And yes, segwit does allow some scaling but is not the end all solution nor will segwit alone allow any scaling that is needed (but it does pave the way for scaling solutions which require malleability fix). Yes, I do support segwit.
Even if someone does not agree with segwit in the scaling debate, they should support it for the fact it fixes malleability and doubles the security of bitcoin signatures among other things.

What bitcoin needs is stability, it is too volatile to be used as a medium of exchange right now. Yes bitcoin will be deflationary over time due to it being non-fiat and will rise with market capitalization. But what we need is slow gradual rise, not insane volatility. What we have right now is stairsteps of bubbles. What I mean by stairsteps of bubbles, just look at the USD valuation history. Bitcoin price trends seems to be in bubbles in which each bubble peaks higher than the previous and the corrections after those bubbles settle higher than what the previous corrections were.

Depends what nation you are in, first it is impossible to ban anything on OpenBazaar because it is a distributed global platform that is not within the bounds of any specific nation. Because product A might be legal in nation B it might be illegal in nation C, but you cannot just ban a specific product on OpenBazaar because everything is illegal in at least one nation. OpenBazaar is not responsible for what is sold on it, just like how Verizon or AT&amp;T are not responsible if their phone service is used for illegal activity. The same is with OpenBazaar, it is a platform.
If there is any legal liability it is on the merchants and buyers.

My answer is
"Classifying bitcoin as a legal currency would help with liquidity of Bitcoin and prevent us as a nation from staying behind the times as other nations such as Japan are friendly to innovation. But governments should NOT regulate it. Regardless though, it does not matter because we do not need the governments permission to do anything, due to the self regulation of the bitcoin protocol and protection by using crypography, governments are becoming archaic. The decentralized nature of bitcoin means governments cannot do anything about it if they tried. If they tried to regulate or even ban it, it would only draw more money from the reported economy into the black economy."

I originally supported OpenBazaar , I thought it had a great vision at first. It still has great potential and I respect the developers for all their great work. But until OpenBazaar supports privacy I cannot support OpenBazaar. You simply cannot have economic freedom in a system that has no privacy. OpenBazaar needs to realize this and also realize that if they do not implement economic freedom through privacy then some other decentralized market will overtake them.

When the Trezor is initiated, it displays the recovery seed on screen in the form of 24 words. If Trezor breaks can securely import the seed to a new Trezor, or to software wallet like Electrum (although this would be less secure than transferring to a new hardware wallet since in this case the key would be stored on your omputer).
Trezor more secure than Electrum because Trezor keeps keys on device itself and the private keys never touches the computer, unlike storing the keys on computer which could get stolen if computer gets compromised. Trezor also uses 24 word seed which offers higher security.

But, as the events of this week unfolded and I prepared to publish the proof of access to the earliest keys, my dog ate it. I do not have the means to live up to my deception. I cannot.
    
    When the rumors began, my qualifications and character were exposed. When those allegations were proven true, new allegations have already begun to surface. I know now that I am not strong enough for this.
    
    I know that this weakness will cause great damage to those that have supported me, and particularly to Jon Matonis and Gavin Andresen. I can only hope that their honour and credibility is not irreparably tainted by my actions. They were deceived, and I know that the world will never believe me anymore. I can only say I’m sorry.

**THEY BACKDOOR YOUR ELECTRONICS BEFORE RETURNING**
Do not let anyone take your electronics out of your eyesight. If you have your electronics taken from you, **do not** accept them back, as is normally the case your electronics have been compromised and/or backdoored before being returned to you. Yeah it sucks, but that is what happens when you live or travel in the Tyrannical States Of America.
Your best bet is to use any means necessary to not let thugs steal your stuff. If you give in and your stuff gets stolen do not accept it back and do not sign anything that states you are refusing to accept it back, only accept payment for cost of electronics. 
Write it off as theft, and restore backups (you should have backups of your data) to a new device. 
As for passwords, do not give them up. Cite your 5th amendment rights. If all else fails just be honest with them by saying you forgot your passwords. Also look into the LUKS nuke patch created by the guys over at kali.org that trashes your crypto keys when a decoy password is entered.

My advise: Encrypt all the things, back up everything and have offsite backups in locations that are not associated with you.
Encrypt your bitcoin and keep backups, do everything anonymously. 
 If your computer gets stolen you can use backup to access your bitcoin to move to a new wallet.
Do not disclose any of your activities or bitcoin balance to anyone outside of family. DONT talk to the police. And most of all, stand your ground in an honorable way. No matter how much you are persecuted, stand your ground.

I think this comes with a 128 GB thumb drive. I wonder what the cost of a 128 GB drive is? Either way, yes tech savvy people will generally just build their own for less cost. This is for people who want to just plug and play, the extra cost is for convenience which is fair so long as it is not too overpriced. I'd rather build my own, It is fairly easy to setup a full node. But I will support anything that decentralizes Bitcoin. Anything that makes it easier for anyone to run a full node, the better, so long as that device is open source to help mitigate the risks of a sybil attack by malicious node makers.

I trust bitcoinpaperwallet.com . The guy behind bitcoinpaperwallet.com is Canton Becker. He is a great person with good rep. He is the developer behind this and sells the security holograms for paper wallets from the site.
If you use bitcoinpaperwallet.com , the most secure way to sue it would be to use a boot disc to run bitcoinpaperwallet.com offline (It can be downloaded for offline use).
Just be sure to encrypt using BIP38 and have multiple copies to keep at different locations. If one location gets compromised, it is secured being encrypted (with strong passphrase of course), plus you will have backups at off-site locations.
Just be sure to test that it can be successfully decrypted with your passphrase before sending money to the paper wallet. 
If you wish another alternative that is not browser based, the bitcoin client Bitcoin Armory  is great option.

My same exact thought.
Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are the first successful global commodity that can be traded in realtime (because internet and being soly digital and not requiring clearance time) that is also not controlled by any centralized entity but self regulated. As a result it is at the raw patterns of human behaviour with no regulation of value but at the mercy of supply and demand. Bitcoin is a series of bubbles triggered by each new ATH (all time high). I think there is a non-speculation backed ATH of which the speculators then pour in which causes a bubble. But each bubble when pops still sits at or higher than the previous floor. I suspect this is a bubble, when the bubble pops the floor I expect will not be less than $1000.

Everytime you use a credit/debit card, check, or electronic transfer, you are putting full faith in the person and/or machine you are giving the number to that they will not over charge or make unauthorized charges. And you are putting full trust that they will safeguard that information properly.
With the current system, credit cards, debit cards, checks, direct deposits and withdraws.... there is no authentication. The same information you give out to make payments is the same information that equates to that of a password. (and no... the trendy "chip and pin" cards are not secure, its only security theater)
In the current system, the only information someone needs to drain you of all your wealth, is the same information you give out to everyone all the time whenever you make a payment.

The report is very conflicting in areas. The document states that the phone is prior to the iOS  version that offers encryption, while also stating that the device is encrypted. The document reads 


Phone would destroy the encryption keys necessary to decrypt the data on the phone, making
it permanently inaccessible. 
Though it also states that the phone version is prior to iOS8 that has encryption. So the question is, is it encrypted or not encrypted? If it is iOS7 then why is Apple unable to process the requests of the law enforcement? Is it because the device is encrypted and Apple is unable to access it as a result, or because Apple does not want to help the unlock requests for other reasons?

Governments want to end cash so they can enslave us in a money system that they can use to control us and conduct surveillance on. Bitcoin allows us to have convenience of electronic payments without governments using financial sector to enslave us. And with new enhancements Bitcoin is getting more privacy. Bitcoin can replace all electronic payments (once scaling technology gets implemented). However physical currency is still needed for situations where we do not have internet access. In these scenarios we could use silver bullion coins. Though I do see eventually where we will have breakthroughs to be able to securely swap bitcoins physically in which balance verification (in standard denominations) and transaction can take place completely offline. There is something called opendime.com that sort of does this, I dont think it is possible to verify balance offline. These look interesting however price is still a bit high for the hardware to be used for everyday transactions.

Credit and debit cards are a joke, anyone dumb enough to own a debit or credit card deserve whatever happens to their money resulting from using it.

I side with Ross, and am against the US government in this case, but to mix politics and bitcoin core protocol rules is very dangerous and opens up the door to problems. When the protocol makes decisions based on politics rather than crypto that is dangerous.

I can second this. There is no reporting on certain types of gold, jm bullion has listed what kinds of bullion do not require reporting.
After buying the gold with no reporting requirements you can then sell the gold to local gold dealers in increments of under $10,000 ( such as $9,990) as needed.
Also, with silver eagles and gold eagles these carry a legal value for only a small percentage of actual mettalic/numistcal value, so you can legally buy a house in gold eagles and only have to report on say $50 (which is legal face value) for every $(price of gold here).
Also look into local bitcoins. But if use local bitcoins be sure to conceal carry if your state allows it, for self protection.

Ulbricht is not in same category as Snowden, but both are hero in my opinion. Snowden brought attention to the unaware population majority of the unconstitutional activities of our government (I was already aware of these long before Snowden, however Snowden provided evidence). Ulbricht in my opinion is a hero for pioneering the use of technology to enable a free market system. We have to understand that Silk Road was universal being it was in cyberspace. Cyberspace is outside of physical realm and as such incompatible with the definitions we know as physical borders of nations by which laws are defined. Everything on Silk Road although illegal in some jurisdictions, were completely legal in other jurisdictions and vice versa. Calling him a criminal is only the opinion of one and the physical jurisdiction of whom the opinionated dwells. Such opinions and definitions of legalities are not compatible with, nor apply to something that is universal such as Silk Road which was a platform, rather such responsibility is instilled to each user individually. Ross was a market operator, what was bought and sold was the business of the buyers and sellers, who bought and sold at each their own will and whom are individually responsible for their own actions and legality of their activities based on their physical location. To place blame of actions of others on Ross when the other parties transacted by their own will, is a fallacy as it is taking the stance that one's will is not the enabler of actions.

They claim that Core is a company that is censoring them and stalling bitcoin progress to keep fees expensive (when it is actually the miners doing this) so they can push everyone onto a centralized system they control called Lighting Network (If I am correct, in my research thus far LN is decentralized).
This reminds me alot of the 2016 US election, where everyone was saying Trump was a racist and that he wanted to eradicate the gays which is utter BS, and now with the US media saying Trump is a Russian spy. The society I live in is a joke because the mindless masses believing anything.
In a system where there is freedom of information, anyone can say anything. I am against censorship, but I am also against fake information. Ffor a free world to be successful requires everyone to educate themselves. Unfortunately the masses are misinformed and follow fallacies without self inquiry and logical thinking.

The issue is though, that each participant used an untrusted, unaudited customized OS which could have been pre-programmed to have specific output, or with botched entropy.
From Peter Todd in that link I posted
"Single Point of Failure
As of writing, I’m not aware of any efforts to independently audit the deterministic build process used to create the compute node DVDs that every participant in the trusted setup used. This means there’s a massive single point of failure in the whole process that completely undermines the value of the multi-party computation.
Until the software and deterministic builds are audited, the entire ceremony is a bunch of crypto hocus pocus that means nothing."

circle is great for turning money from your bank into bitcoin.
Whomever holds the keys to your bitcoin controls them. Circle is has a good reputation, but you should eventually use your own wallet instead of a webwallet so you can be the true owner of your funds.
However keep in mind that while having your own wallet allows you to have true ownership and control over your bitcoin, with this comes responsibility in making sure your wallet is backed up and safe from malware if dealing with alot of funds.

Just tell her that most mainstream news promote lies, fake news, and propaganda. To not believe anything without self inquiry. The american media is complete joke, I was in a pub the other day and saw the telescreen blasting fake news all over the place about "Trump under criminal investigation" and "Trump is a Russian agent", "Russia hacked the election". The US media propagates lies and BS.
