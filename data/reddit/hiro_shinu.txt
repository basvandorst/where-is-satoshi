Just select international and put in your U.S. drivers license. Binance originates from China so anything outside of China will be considered "international".

what exchange do you use to day trade and do you have any issues with transactions times? For example bitcoin price goes up and down a few hundreds dollars in just a few minutes. How are you able to catch these trades if bitcoin takes 10-15 mins to confirm. I'm extremely interested in trading but I haven't come across any good resources for day trading bitcoins.

Also have these two coins in my binance account, does anyone know what they are and when they will be available to get rid of?

Awesome man, thank you so much for the info. Have you had any success day trading lesser known cryptos? Just curious as to how other people are doing. I want to get a good idea of how day trading cryptos work before jumping in.

Banks use their customers money to fund their loans, they don't print money themselves...what are you talking about?

There are alt coins specifically for this, you can get paid in their coin and then sell that coin for bitcoin on an exchange. For example theres a coin called, "Musicoin". This platform allows for you to post music and be paid in "Musicoin".
