I read the news on Coinbase but don't understand. Why would people get BCH unexpectedly because if the fork?

I use an Electrum BTC wallet. It was set up as a "standard" one. How to I change it to use SegWit? Do I need to remove it and reinstall it?

and what does this mean? why?

@_date: 2017-12-03 19:43:04
What does that mean? How do you do that?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:39:16
ok thanks. so then, why a fork? why not start from zero? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:31:32
That is what I was thinking but you've confirmed it for me. Thanks you.

lay off the crack.

Couldn't the client withdraw and send the money to a wallet via GDax and avoid the fees? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:24:31
Pff. It's not like people understand where fiat money comes from or how it works. So why have different standards/expectancies for people who possess crypto?

I'm new to this. How come? Why is it so difficult? Can't you just sell them on the exchanges? Seems easy enough, no? 
@_date: 2018-09-08 21:55:33
you are taking things way too seriously here... 
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:23:04
How do you use SegWit? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:14:37
How are you supposed to read that? 
@_date: 2018-09-08 21:46:50
That would be nice. I'll invite you to my housewarming party.

Enough comparing a crypto that aren't actually being used as they were intended for (everyday currency) to companies that produce goods and services. They are not the same thing. Not even close.

You've got to cash out at some point and there's a trail left behind on the blockchain. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 11:33:49
That’s all theory. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 09:10:05


And that is based on what FACTS?

It means you're not getting enough sex. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 03:37:53
How so?

FUD level 100. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 06:24:22
There is no guarantee that it will go back up.

Who cares? I lived very well before the Internet. Quite frankly, life was better before the Internet. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 12:04:01
Well that means nothing.

Happiness. Humans are not happier. Life has changed, and its more complex, but happiness has not improved. We are wasting a lot of energy perusing happiness and we are not getting any closer. Look at the US.  It’s a very unhappy place...

Capitalism is successful? What's your definition of success? What we have today sure isn't "success" to me. Especially in the west. There is a reason depression and suicide keeps rising in developed countries...
