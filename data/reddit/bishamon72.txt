Sending a bitcoin tx right now is slow or expensive, because layer 1 is all there is. When LN is ready, you'll only need to open a small number of channels (and fewer as more people adopt it). But once those channels are open, you can send and receive on layer 2 and don't have to worry about layer 1 as much. And when you do use layer 1, it'll be faster and cheaper than it is now.

Want to guess how long it took the telephone system to change from having people as switchboard operators and automate it?
About 80 years. The first switchboard operator was hired in 1878. Automated systems weren't in widespread use until the [1960s](
We're still in the very early days of adoption and interest grew a little quicker than expected in the last few months. But solutions are in the works and by next year, they'll be in wide use.

No. A transaction will only show up in one block, not all of them. There's a link from one block to another, but once a block is "mined" it's permanent.
The stages of a transaction are:
- Broadcast on the network to put it in the "mempool"
- Wait in the mempool until a miner decides to add your tx to the block they're going to mine next.
- The miner who decided to include your transaction is the first to broadcast the mined block with your transaction in it to everyone else.
- Everyone else agrees that that's the next valid block and the process starts over with the transactions left in the mempool.
- Your transaction is considered "confirmed" when there are at least two more blocks mined after the block with your transaction in that that are added to the chain of blocks.
Miners are greedy. They tend to try to mine a block containing the transactions with the highest fees offered.
If you put a high fee, every miner will include your transaction in the next block and it'll get added in 20 minutes or less.
If you put a low fee, your transaction will be ignored until there's no other transactions with higher fees.

If you don’t control the private key, you don’t control the coins. 
For a small amount, a wallet on your phone or computer is fine. For larger amounts, use a hardware wallet with a paper backup of the seed. 
What’s considered a small or large amount is up to you. Choose wisely.

Running a bitcoin network node is not the same thing as mining.
Miners need lots of compute power, but only one network node for the whole mining pool.
There are plenty of people who run nodes without running a mining farm and to ask those people to bear the cost of larger block sizes doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:13:46
The blocks are stored on servers in physical files. Each node on the bitcoin network has a full copy of the blockchain. There are likely offline backs of the chain as well.
If everyone of those nodes (and there are thousands of them all over the globe) were to go offline, then bitcoin has just disappeared. Someone could then restore from one of the backups and set up another node.
The first block has a well known structure. Because of the crypto, it's an easy process to verify that a chain is valid by starting at the last block and checking all the way back to the first. Some transactions may be lost if there wasn't a recent backup of the last blocks, but the majority of the chain would be restored.
However, if we find ourselves in a situation where every node is down, bitcoin will be the last of your problems.

The ATMs save on fees by batching transactions. If 100 people buy from the ATMs within a few minutes, they can put the transfer from their wallet to all the buyers into one transaction and spread the fee out over all the buyers.

I think you're underestimating the high end unless you already have plans at that point (car, house, etc).
I finally bought in at about $11.5K. Not saying how much, but if it goes to 0, I won't go bankrupt. I'm hodling until it's 0 or I can spend it on everyday purchases. As long as it's not rocketing towards 0, I'll also be buying bits at a time with any discretionary funds I have in the future.

I didn’t bother checking, but it should show up within a few minutes as there might be a slight delay while they try to combine transactions.
The last transaction I sent from my wallet (not gdax), I put about 300 sat/byte fee on it and it showed up in the mempool in a few seconds and the first confirmation was in about 15 minutes.

Wire transfers on GDAX are not free, but are on Gemini. 
GDAX charges $10 for an inbound wire and $25 for outbound.
GDAX also charges ~~15~~ 0.15 Euro for SEPA wires in and out. This doesn't apply to Gemini.
But BTC-BTC transfers and ACH transfers are free in both places.
Edit: 0.15, not 15 Euro. The Euro symbol and zero blurred together.

You sent coins. The only way to get it back is to have the “friend” send them back. There’s no way Kraken can tell if you made a mistake or if you’re trying to scam someone. They’re just the intermediary in a one way transaction.
Rule  of using bitcoin is once sent, they’re gone.  The only exception is if you sent with a low fee and it gets dropped after tweets or more, but there’s no guarantee of that happening. 
The cryptography used in bitcoin ensures that there’s nothing Kraken can do except steal the coins from the other person. And that would be the end of Kraken. If you thought the shitstorm about Coinbase was bad, you haven’t seen anything compared to the first exchange to revert a transaction unilaterally.

Best way to buy into a dip because you don’t have to time it. My problem is I just got my next round of “can afford to lose it” fiat and then the drop to $14K happened and I panic bought. Now I have to wait another month or so before I can set up buys again.

Your fallacy is assuming a fork will fix all the problems. Yes, fees are high and transactions take too long to confirm. But BTC is not ready for everyday use as "spending money" - YET - we're still on the initial upswing of the adoption curve (not price). Once there's widespread adoption, then we can enter phase 3 of everyday use.
So we have problems now, but a fork is not the answer. You don't abandon ship, you plug the leak. That's what segwit and LN are doing and they'll be done before we get to the point where we're entering the third phase.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:56:29
Yes. Bitcoins have value in two ways: what you can sell the coin for and what you can buy with it. 
We’re currently in “phase 2” of bitcoin where most value comes from what you can sell it for. Phase 1 was the “free money” days when it was easily mineable. In phase 2, mining for coins is still possible but only makes sense for large farms. I mine with a GPU and it pays for itself, but you’re not going to make money that way. 
As phase 2 progresses, the price will increase as more people adopt bitcoin (notice I didn’t say invest in). 
Eventually we’ll reach phase 3 and see equilibrium on money going into and out of bitcoin. The price will stabilize and, with improvements like Lightening Network, we’ll start to see more places accept it for payment and then the value in bitcoin will be in what you can buy with it. 
I have more thoughts on bitcoin but I’m on mobile. I’ll make a post with my views on it later. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:45:17
GDAX pays the fee (and groups a few transactions together), but it’s not super high, so it can take a few hours (possibly up to a day) for it to be confirmed. I think my last withdrawal took about 10 hours. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:00:32
One of the major points of bitcoin is the fact that there will only ever be 21 million coins. If it can be forked at any time, it’s no better than fiat.
This is the main reason I don’t like altcoins. Every one of them misses the point of cryptocurrency. Have problems with bitcoin? Work inside the system to fix it. You’re not going to fix it by making 10000 alts.

Exactly how long they wait and what happens to the contents varies by state. In one of the first results on Google, I found this:
Here, abandoned contents are sent to the state treasury, but
    Any property, including documents or writings of a private nature, that has little or no apparent financial value need not be sold but may be destroyed by the bank
A flash drive or seed phrase might just be destroyed. Your lawyer is actually your best bet. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:03:25
Yes, and it's effectively an increase to 4 MB blocks without having a hard fork. And it's almost ready to go. Bitcoin Core supports segwit everywhere but the UI. Most exchanges have the code ready (but not deployed). They're waiting for segwit to be in the BTC Core UI which should happen with the next release.
That's still only a short term solution. Larger blocks will only solve the issue of high fees. No matter how large the block, there's still the need for three confirmations before a transaction is completed. That can take up to 30 minutes no matter the block size. This is the issue that Lightening Network solves.

If you only got into crypto a month ago, you've still got a bit to learn about blockchains.
    How could you send bitcoin to a bitcoin cash account? They aren't the same thing.
Bcash was a fork from bitcoin. Every bcash address is a valid bitcoin address as well. The stackexchange link above shows what happens in a situation like this.
Bob sends 1 BTC to Alice's BCH address.
Alice will now have 1 BTC on the Bitcoin network at her address.
Kraken has the private keys for Alice's address. They've got it marked as a BCH address and aren't going to look on the bitcoin network for it's balance, just the bcash network, which won't show the bitcoin.
The bitcoin can be gotten to, but it would have to be an employee of Kraken. They'd need to access the private key for Alice's address, set up a bitcoin wallet using that key, and send the bitcoin to a bitcoin address owned by Bob. Bob could then convert the bitcoin to bcash and send it to Alice's bcash address.
The problem in that scenario is Kraken would lose the trust of all the community if it was known that an employ could use the private keys to set up a stand alone wallet and send coins from it (even if it's to another Kraken address).
The best you can hope for is that Kraken gives Alice the private keys for her address and she does the work above. I haven't heard of an exchange doing that and they likely won't. Hence, they're both fucked.

It’s called arbitrage and the issue is transferring from one exchange to the other. That takes time and while you’re waiting, the price difference could evaporate. 
Only way to do arbitrage successfully is to already have spare cash and bitcoin at the major exchanges to trade with.

Is there a way to see the stop and stop limit orders on GDAX or other exchanges? I have a feeling that's why we're in such a free fall is all the stops being hit combined with panic sellers as they wake up and see the drop.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:26:44
Larger blocks are a short term solution. The bitcoin community decided segwit is the short term solution for bitcoin. That work is done in the core code. It just needs GUI support which will be in the next version.
If the community decided right now to go with larger block sizes, the code would still have to be written, tested, and deployed. That's not going to happen overnight and segwit will be fully finished in the reference code before then.
The only thing holding up segwit is adoption by the exchanges, some of which may have ulterior motives.
