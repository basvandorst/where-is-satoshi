Alright, posting from a different account.
There were lots of previous trips floating in BTC (think of some of BTC's 'dark' history).. i could pick up on lots of the trips other people have had where they ended up staring into the chart a little too long as well.
Psychedelics do this strange thing where time &amp; space blend into telepathic energy. I cannot tell you whether i dreamt these things of course, as one could argue that a trip is basically a psychotic episode.. but anyway, this is what i saw.
One was in India. I was out on the beach with my friends.. and we were lying on the sand looking at the stars. The entire sky and stars started turning into a giant circle / torus. I could sense an alien intelligence observing us and on the brink of making contact.. like a whole universe is filled with intelligence to the brim, and this intelligence is currently observing our every move.
Thoughts started entering into my mind that for the first time in the history of mankind, we have a new money that is fully transparent. We have complete freedom to not only be entire self-sufficient, but to keep a trace of who we are by out we transact. We can choose not to transact in bullshit businesses that ruin the planet or hurt others. Every man woman and child can be their own bank, and keep a clean account of their guilt-free trades.
We are still in our infancy.. as a civilisation, and essentially all the digital records we are keeping in our emails, our transactions, our every digital trace is being collected and analysed to decide whether we can make contact or not. Keep some digital hygiene going. Choose how you spend your bitcoin wisely. Also at one point i was about to have an immense feeling of power rush through me, but it totally vanished as i remembered my coins were on an exchange. My friend was even tuning into those feelings.. as he always does. The exchange bit definitely curbed that part of the trip a bit.
Then on the first trip i'd had, i clearly remember connecting up with Elon Musk at one point, who gave me this crystal clear sense that 1 BTC was all that's required to take a trip to space. A literal trip to space that is (you should read up about Musk's alleged party lifestyle. I'm sure he's a tripper). But i also got this very direct feel that i could lose my entire investment too. It was a feeling that every hodler has to deal and live with obviously.. maybe a test of fortitude.
There some more stuff, but probably not as crystal clear or relevant. To resume:
- 1 BTC will take afford you a trip to space.
- You could lose it all (at least that feeling is real, and intended).
- Keep your coins off exchanges.
- Keep good digital hygiene, and don't transact with bullshit businesses.
- Your BTC transactions ARE your transactional identity. Use them for good.
- First time this perfect and immutable ledger technology is introduced to humans. Civilisational shift.
- The aliens are watching to see how we use this tech, and whether to make contact.

Read my previous comments about my very strong LSD trip while staring into the BTC charts. Elon was in it. Obviously an acid trip shouldn't be the basis for a serious discussion.. it doesn't have much more value than a very very very lucid dream.
But nevertheless, it was pretty crystal clear to me then.
@_date: 2019-08-28 10:45:16
Lots of sense being spoke right here /\

I took 7 hits of acid once and stared deep into the Bitcoin chart. First off, it holds the memory of lots of trips, due to its darknet involvement. Also, we're going to space, literally. At some point in the not so long future, 1 BTC will get you a ticket to outer-space (but the risk of losing it all is very real, too).
The adoption of this distributed, transparent, and immutable ledger is a major step for our society &amp; civilisation in gaining acceptance from the rest of life in the universe. Our folks just gave us some pocket money and are keeping tabs on how we choose to use it. Only then will they decide whether we have matured enough to move up the food chain.

Yeap. The "the risk of losing it all is very real, too" still felt very real. I think at that point i was getting some thoughts from Elon.. BTC felt very much like a fully binary asset; all or nothing. That feeling never went away. Whether that's true or not, i don't know, but it was the feeling that came across very clearly, and still how majority of people view this asset.
Like someone could snap their fingers, and BTC could just drop to zero. In reality, that's just not possible. People buy dips, and the miner infrastructure counts for so much too. But that feeling of risk was real though. One of many reasons this asset is so polarising.

Do you still have the code? Why don't you post that shit on Medium?

give it a couple of.. oh let's call it: 2024

You may be making a leap in judgement: scammers interact with binance, therefore binance is a scammer. I think it's a bit unfair. Scammers are everywhere.
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:00:19
Wow, ELI5 award for you. :) Thanks.
@_date: 2019-05-03 04:31:25
Can you explain why Binance? Are you saying that because your'e against centralisation?
@_date: 2019-05-23 09:49:03


Sounds like a pageant i'd get behind.
@_date: 2019-05-24 10:14:00
hahah ... ok ;)

What's a total shame is that both Peter and Saif are super knowledgeable people, and probably have lots of very different knowledge to share.
Yet the whole thing is a shouting match.

How can we come across like sensationalist ignoramuses by stating facts? Much easier if we can bend, twist and distort things. So much incredible.

Don’t worry about the transaction part, it’s being used as a store if value that works well enough to transact.

What's wrong with bitpay?
@_date: 2019-05-19 15:47:20
I see where you're coming from, but it kind of is. For a lot of people, especially those still resisting in the financial sector, not having a position will eventually feel like being run over.
@_date: 2019-05-09 16:06:16
The incentive is that you have a local copy of your and everyone else’s transactions, which adds safety to the network. One of the incentives behind BTC is that you can participate in the trust layer.

We’ll probably go parabolic. Think of all the fiat to btc on ramps. Think of the awareness. Think of the greed. If retail can make it go parabolic, I dare not imagine the shape of the next major moves.

ok i'm snapping out of 5 year old mode. :)


What is the original purpose? What are you relying on when you say this? I'm curious as Nakamoto was a bit more of a rebel in that sense, e.g the message he inserted in the genesis block (something along the lines of 'The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks')


Thinking of TPD, fees, buyer protection, accessible user experience etc. can you think of other methods of online payment that are more convenient than Bitcoin? What features make them more convenient?
Thanks for the 'back of the napkin' calculations. It's really nice how you laid it out, how Bitcoin's circulating supply being worth around 28 million USD based on the average transaction price and volume. :)
@_date: 2019-05-23 18:18:01
Ok nice. How about:




Are those political statements?

Bitcoin being an asset where people seek refuge is a good thing.

tldr: old man yells at bitcoin. old man dies. young man is right.
@_date: 2019-05-14 05:30:26
Hmm. Gold's price is manipulated through the tight control of gold reserves, so i view BTC as a better investment. However i like gold for its properties, and its demand will never go away thanks to these properties.
As such the 'drop gold' slogan erks me a little.
@_date: 2019-05-22 07:58:30
OK explain it like i'm 10 then. :)
There's many types of bitcoin right? There's the "held" Bitcoin, stashed away in hodler wallets, that are not up for sale (yet). Then there's the available Bitcoin, that exchanges or individuals are willing to sell.
The price at which these transactions are made are what determines the price of Bitcoin, right?
My concern, is that the % of the entire Bitcoin supply that i hold remains the same. Does that mean my "making power" remains the same? i.e if i sell 1000 BTC today, that would tank the market because i'd flood the market with Bitcoins for a little while, so the price would drop as i'd have to sell the cheaper and cheaper to fill my orders.
Well how's that any different now with, say, when BTC hits 100K? Say i sell the first 100 btc at 100K, then no orders come in so i sell at 90K and all the way to say 70K. I just tanked the market and messed with everyone's heads.
How is that going to change in the future?

Jeeze, that's for defining what "preaching to the choir" means.
