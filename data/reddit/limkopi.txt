Congrats. I wish to spread it to family and friends someday, but for now my buy in at 17k needs to ride the lightning!

Dont use the ledger app. A lot of reports that it is not functioning well

Your fee may be too low. You have to either wait for it to be dropped from mempool or pray it gets confirmed later. I selected "normal" as the tx fee and it took nearly 3hrs to clear.

Finger on left button, disconnect ledger, finger still on left button, open the manager again and reconnect. Give it a minute to start. If it doesnt start, do it again.
