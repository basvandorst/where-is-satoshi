Dear guys, I know Ahmed personally and I helped him opening a Bitcoin wallet for this initiative. We can show how Bitcoin can be useful for this situation and let him do this surgery.
I'll work with him in order to let the Hip-Clinic accept bitcoin and show that GoFundMe should turn to Bitcoin for initiatives like this.
Please let me know how I can show you that the address 1Mc7uzZd31k5bEi2np7wog3EXDPU9mJnny belongs to him.
Thank you for your support, I am sure that we can outpace the Paypal donations in a while!

The plateaux is influenced by exchange rate, in October the break even in bitcoin currency was higher than today. Now we can mine less and still be able to pay electricity bills.

Hey, it's the very same area the Labcoin scammer is coming from!

So, basically, you are telling me that a Bitcoin-business company should stay away from Bitcoin itself?
And buying bitcoins is a dumb gamble which is just a volatile game?
What happens to a Bitcoin company (anyway) if that volatile price drops too much?
Let me read again, maybe I'm reading some Buttcoin replies...

I'd rather go for "a Ponzi for redistributing randomly from one libertarian to another"!

Try to double at 42. 
And buy a towel too.

No, right now we are in the upper 35Gb.
64 is the bare minimum!

Right now I swapped the SD memory with my old Rpi rev.2 (using an adapter obv.), after 10 minutes of indexing it's now working!
Not suitable for portability, but it seems that I've found a way to run Bitcoind on old RaspberryPIs: compile on the (faster) new device, and then deploy on the older one!
