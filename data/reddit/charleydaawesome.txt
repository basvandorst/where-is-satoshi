Wouldnt the best choice be to sell and then rebuy cheap if thats the case?

So, as someone new to btc. Why is segwitx2 a bad thing? Im niether for or against it atm, just been reading up on whats going on. It seems like increasing the size would be helpful, am i wrong about this?

Thats about what i was thinking. That they all already exist and youre just generating a key and encrypting that wallet. So is it technically possible for two people to generate the same wallet?

So how would someone get started in btc?

Im confused then. How would the cold wallet recognize that the funds were sent to it?
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:22:47
I see. Is there any way to remove funds from cold storage without compromising the wallet? Or would i have to make another if i withdrew some funds?

I see, that makes sense. Im guessing you can still make a watchonly wallet for the paper wallets? Also how does the blockchain even know that the offline wallet exists since it was never connected?  
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:28:13
I assume its sent the same way through usb and then signing it on the offline?

Yeah the term wallet was definitely what was fucking me up here. I think i understand it much better now though, thank you

Yeah ive been considering it, but atm i have a relatively small amount of btc so it doesnt seem worth it yet. I also prefer to know about all the methods and the way they work. So if i kept the cold wallet on an old offline pc, i could send things to it using its address even though its not connected? I guess the blockchain would record where those bitcoins had been sent and they would be marked as in the cold wallet? But how would the cold wallet itself know they were there? Sorry to bother you with all these questions

Buy with bank account instead of card. Lower fees
