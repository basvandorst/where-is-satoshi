Will lightning network become a widely used method to transact? If yes,  when? If no,  how would Bitcoin support millions of transactions?

No, one way to prove this is you can use a pair of binoculars to look at a boat moving away from you on the horizon, you can see the tippy top of the boat until it disappears. If the earth is flat, you would see the entire boat gets smaller and smaller in size but it would not disappear.

I think btc would be around $4k-5k if SEC announced another delay next month. Then, it would fluctuate between $4k-$8k in anticipation of rejection or approval of etf. If approved, btc would moon to $50k at the very least. Just my 2 sats.

I would not be surprised when btc surpasses their whole business ops in the next decade, then a "hack" happens....

As much as i want it to be free speech, i really hope so but it may not be because the code can be executed to produce actions, and actions are governed by law.

I don’t think $125mil is enough, gotta be at least $1B, at least. Or better yet, the amount should be in BTC not $.

And the most annoying thing is what is that black line on my screen?
@_date: 2018-07-21 04:09:53
I guess there are many people who dont know how to buy it themselves, like my dad. Also, don't you think an etf approved by the US SEC would influence people to learn more about btc? I know I would be.
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:41:28
Why not? People will start bitching about transaction fee again once btc hits another ATH, then altcoins will rise.
