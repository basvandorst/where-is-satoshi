What is RBF?
Edit: Found it. Replace By Fee. i.e. You pay higher fee to replace your previous transaction.

I'm testing sending a transaction with 0.01 mBTC fee. Let's see if it goes through.
Edit: Transaction not confirmed on the first block.
Edit 2: 10 hours later. Transaction still not confirmed.

I would propose a system where the maximum blocksize doubles every 2 years (52595 blocks). Assuming technology progresses exponentially, this would allow home users to keep running nodes while allowing Bitcoin to grow exponentially too. We could start by making the blocksize limit 2 MB for example in 6 months.

You clearly don't know anything about Bitcoin. Bitcoin uses system where it automatically adjusts difficult so that a new block is generated every 10 minutes. If only one person mines, he gets all the new Bitcoins. There is no way to stop more Bitcoins from generating.
In addition, without mining, there can be no Bitcoin transactions because they are encoded in the blockchain. (Ok, there can be transactions, but they won't be verified so nothing is preventing you from for example double spending money.)
Mining forms the backbone of the network. There can't be Bitcoin without mining.

These could be used for heating...
If you're going to use electricity to heat your home, might as well generate some bitcoins doing it.

This is why translations should be done by a local that speaks English. Not the other way around.

(you need to be rooted to access this file)
@_date: 2015-04-04 02:47:50
If the phone isn't rooted, the thief has to just root it. Ok, so add 15 minutes to the time.

Someone can just open the file, get the pin and spend all the coins. It takes like 5 minutes.
@_date: 2015-03-15 20:23:31
Sounds legit.

Can you tell us more about this "security error"? It's always nice to learn from others' mistakes.
@_date: 2015-03-10 21:01:29
I've never used changetip system. I'd like to learn!

Plot twist: OP actually owns the address that was used to send the coins. Therefore, "rightful owner" will never be found and this is just a publicity stunt for internet points.

And now lesson in sending tip:

I don't have enough bandwidth to run a full node. Running a full node makes my connection very laggy. (6 Mb/s down, 0.5 Mb/s up)

Registered, and I was immediately able to withdraw to my own wallet. I wonder how they prevent people abusing this by registering multiple accounts?

*"It didn't encrypt everything in the police department. It was just that computer and specific files"*
*"Because the backups were also infected, the option was to pay the hacker and get the files unencrypted," Harden said, "which is what we decided to do."*
So the backups of important data were stored on the same computer? A backup stored on the same computer isn't even much of a backup really.

Remember when people asked how to get small amount of bitcoin easily? Now's the time.

These kind of emails get most often automatically blocked by spam filters because they are coming from wrong SMTP server. This is probably why this scammer chose not to use "contact
