You don't have to. No one force you to buy. In fact, you don't even have to come here and complain.

If bumping the block size is much more simpler, why don't we do this in the first place?

There are always two side of an arguments. When you prefer smaller blocks, you will only notice poster who post long and detailed posts for larger blocks. What you haven't noticed is there are similar amount of smaller blocks poster.
IMHO, content of the post or comment matter, not how long they are.

Nice analogy. But Bitcoin is not "your house".

Because you are new, that's why.

This was from last December, in a completely different context, yet you still tried to attach it to headers-first/only mining.

IMHO, hard forks are not threats. They're opportunities. People should be able to choose whatever they believe. Mike and Gavin are doing a good job of providing options together with pros and cons. Let nature take its course. If people love XT, they'll go for it. Otherwise they will stick with Core. There is nothing wrong with it.
@_date: 2015-08-04 17:38:57


You're the one making assumption here.
@_date: 2015-08-28 18:20:41
Believe it or not, this has nothing to do with Bitcoin.

One major difference is that Bitcoin cannot be printed, or produce out of thin air.

How about sending 100 bits to 100 different addresses? Will this be relayed by the network?
@_date: 2015-07-16 00:46:04
No.

Probably nothing. Brute force SHA256 is infeasible. Mining is unprofitable.
@_date: 2015-08-11 16:37:11
I assume this is the standard requirements for doing business (in the USA)? Also, are you expect to sell over $10,000 daily and not paying taxes?
@_date: 2015-07-24 17:30:04
Sorry but unless you are a miner, your choice of Core or XT has no influence.

Buying BTCs **remotely** with solely **debit card**? Sounds like if you, by any chance, can get some BTCs, then a lot of credit card thieves can, too.

What's the chance of being a winner? I know it's better than finding a private key, or common lottery, but if you rely on that incentive when accepting Bitcoin, then you shouldn't accept Bitcoin in the first place.

So what's the point of getting new users if they only make a single transaction per account? Meh, Coinbase does not need such users.

I agree. Not only banks, but telemarketers in general are very annoying.
But then, when you have trouble, who would you call if you are using Bitcoin?

No it does not. Read for yourself.

For example, look at these Mt.Gox transactions: 
That's exactly what you will do: create a bunch of addresses and send coins to themselves. Now imagine if one day you decided to spend coins from any of these addresses. Since every address only contains transactions originated from your original address (in this case is 1KecDYadohxk8MCDqKF8SBEMhCUNveAsCj), everyone will know it's you. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 04:17:19
That's absolutely true. Like, who polices the police and who audits the banks?
@_date: 2015-11-16 22:56:21
Well, technically when you destroy a bitcoin it's still there, you just have no way to access it. Just like sending a piece of gold to the deep ocean. You know it's there somewhere, but accessing it is close to impossible.
@_date: 2015-03-05 22:38:53
That's not true.

It's not really about being 'under paid'. Transactions are cancelled by BitPay because of the difference in exchange rate between Circle and BitPay.

Setup a recurrence buy on Coinbase, like once every 2 weeks, depends on how frequent you receive your paycheck. 
@_date: 2015-03-14 01:13:02
It's not that easy with Bitcoin, because the government, or any other entity can just "print" Bitcoin like they did with Euro. They have to somehow convert the whole currency into Bitcoin. But who's gonna sell them Bitcoin in exchange for a worthless currency after that?

I found this particularly is the most convenience way to transfer money between my accounts. Just write a check, scan it and done. There are many ways to get checks for cheap price. Like 200 checks for $4 - $5 or so. I don't remember because it might take me ages to use all of them.
@_date: 2015-03-23 04:36:45
Then these addresses will only contain transactions made by yourself. Using some basic cross validation techniques, one can figure out who you are based on your past transactions (not very easy, but not impossibly hard either).
Assume that 10 people involved in a coin mixing session. You won't be able to tell future transactions come from which person. What if 100, 1000 people involved? The chance to find the correct person is nearly impossible.
My arguments relied solely on inspecting transactions available on blockchain, not additional data like purchase info (shipping address, etc.)
