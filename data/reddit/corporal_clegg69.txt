Chinas not the only one man 
Seems like blockchain may just become a new foundation for national currency.

Sure, they may continue to be mined, but the main demand and supply is coming from China. If China announces renminbit, bitcoin price will probably half again in a few minutes. Probably the only reason bitcoin is even legal in China right now is so that the mining companies and government can build experience with it. That's how they operate. When the time comes to launch RMBit there's a good chance that the mining companies will be forced into government takeovers and they will mine RMBit for the government. (or is that not how it works?)
A huge price drop at that point could really be too much for miners not blessed with cheap land and electricity to bear. 
I'm not trying to bring the doom and gloom here but it seems to me this a big deal. The only out I can see is that we move into cryptocurrency world and all countries will have their own cryptocurrency and bitcoin really becomes bitgold. But can it even survive a banning and takeover in China. The thing that worries me the most is I haven't even heard anything about this in bitcoin news until recently but its a big deal. Tell me why it isn't.

prices will fluctuate
@_date: 2016-06-08 01:53:37
but the demand would decrease hugely also. china is blowing bubbles in everything these days. Too much money and not enough good investment. I'm really considering taking profit here for the short term. RMBit news will crush the bitcoin price unless its adoption gets properly diversified.

"Nevertheless, since we provide a valuable feature to our customers who wish to settle in Renminbi, we believe it is imperative to maintain a robust AML/ATF/Sanctions program as we connect with the fiat currency financial system. We may at times have opinions of different regulatory approaches taken by various government bodies; however, at all times, we will fully abide by rules and regulations of respective countries. We regularly outreach to regulators and industry on the best approach to regulating digital asset businesses. As the PBOC endeavors to foster a safe and compliant digital asset trading platform industry, OKCoin.cn will abide by both the letter and spirit of such regulatory guidelines, including the implementation of Know Your Customer controls, monitoring for suspicious activity, reporting of suspicious transaction activity and cooperating with local authorities who may at times inquire of transactional information."

just call them and ask
@_date: 2017-09-14 07:56:41
You might be right that there is no hard limit actually. I edited my initial post to reflect. There's surely a soft limit though. As they said, they intend to report any suspicious activity.
@_date: 2017-09-14 07:52:38
Look, when they started regulating weibo, did they put a notice on their website saying that if you talk shit about the PP you will have your account deleted and maybe go to jail? My point is that it may not be convenient for them to technically regulate it legally same as a currency because it's "not a currency". I always just assumed that they were regulating because right about the time of regulation they started asking for and verifying all your info. Maybe you can buy more than 50k but I'm not sure anyone in their right mind would, knowing as okcoin state in their policy, that they will be reported to the government.

I live in China. There are no restrictions on transferring any currency out of the country. I know because I do it a lot. The restrictions are in converting currency. Each person can only convert 50,000 USD worth of RMB in any one year. This applies whether you convert currency in a bank or in a bitcoin exchange. You can transfer as much as you like but you cannot receive foreign currency from another Chinese person into your Chinese account unless they are family. Source: Last year I sent 90,000 Euros to from China to Ireland last year legally, using banks and bitcoin.
These new regulations that are rumoured to be coming into effect don't make sense according to the wealth transfer argument because that hole was plugged last year. This is something different Judging by the way they are doing it, I think they are just pumping the brakes a bit. They don't want a bloodbath. Bare in mind, we are still not sure who created bitcoin. It could even be a foreign government, Russian, American or Chinese. Of course a country like China with strong control is not going to leave the door wide open to get fucked.

brilliant, thanks
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:40:05
yea, also bear in mind if something requiring money happens in your life, you will be forced to sell bitcoin to pay for it, god forbid. I didn't have enough savings to pay for my wedding last year and had to sell at 1200, look at me now. I have half the bitcoin I had back then and the value of my savings is a quarter of what it would have been if I wasn't forced to sell. My main goal now to protect my bitcoin investment is to build enough cash to be able to let it ride no matter what.

it's the chinese too man. I've seen it myself trying to get my family into it. when it's cheap they don't want much, then the price doubles and their like all in! but im not recommending it at this high price lol. i recommend it because it was cheap
@_date: 2017-09-14 05:59:27
it doesn't let you bypass it. the law applies to exchanges since last year.
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:18:00
why would you think that? it seems that there are more pools supporting bitcoin cash now even, than support bitcoin core  . I'm just curious why you feel so certain that bitcoin will suceed even in the face of the problems cash and b2x were designed to overcome + the upcoming attack fork.
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:58:53
but the problem only doesn't exist now because bitcoin failed to scale when the problem arose last time and people moved into alts and back tot their old methods of money transfer? Aren't you concerned that they will fail to scale again? Nevermind the fact that lightning network also has centralisation issues, Last time we started to feel the blocksize cap,the market share of btc dropped from 90% to 50% therabouts. I don't see that that made bitcoin stronger at all, it solved the problem for now, but it's still there and no tried proper solution available. Some controversies make bitcoin stronger, some don't. That controversy weakened it significantly. I don't see blanket applicability of the money badger argument as you seem to do.

That is awesome! Downloading now. How does the lightening payment work then? It says it's instant but doesn't that mean that I will need to remain inside lightning to use the funds, almost like Lightning is issuing me a line of credit exactly equal to the balance across all payment channels not closed plus my account balance? How often are the transactions cleared on the chain?
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:55:50
So I guess then maybe checking the transactions taking place out of wallets used mainly for purchase of goods and services would be one way, like bit pay, but who are the other significant players, and how does one view the number of transactions happening on bit pay even. Or for example, subtracting the number of transactions taking place across the major exchanges... At least by comparison this value to previous values, you might be getting closer to an answer. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:33:06
i dont see any reason to assume that these massive companies that have made an aggreement to do something would not have made the preperations to follow through. Their reputation is at stake if nothing else. Why signal with no intention to update, especially when it's so contentious? You're right that it remains to be seen, but if I was to bet, which obviously I am, I would be fairly certain that they will run the new software. Otherwise, what's the point of the whole thing.
@_date: 2017-09-14 06:15:36
Just read you post again, there could be a rule about transferring to the states that I don't know about. I just transferred 2 BTC to Ireland last week to take advantage or the big price difference between China and the world (easy 10% profit) and there was no restriction. I can't think of any way that they could restrict it. They can't decypher the country from the address.
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:27:31
so there are as many networks as there are people running the software?
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:30:57
But who are the channels opened between then. Like if I buy something from a vendor one time, I will never need that channel again so it would close directly, which is just the same way transactions happen currently, with an extra layer. Is there a more complex mechanic and the term channel is a simplification of it. Like we all have a channel to lightning and it acts like a hub and i only close my channel when I want to transfer for example into cold storage. I'm just confused then, doesn't that mean that every bitcoin transaction will need to take place on the same lightning network or else it will awkward from a user standpoint since I will need to have a different lightning for each use case. It seems like lightning then will be a super centralized hub, with few to no competitors or else it will be too awkward to even use.
edit: I'm absolutely not a troll but really just trying to understand how this is working. Don't want to distract time from devs for sure. This is the first concrete example of a lightning network I've seen and I'm stoked, but how does it work!?
@_date: 2017-10-10 07:46:51
So are you calling the creators of segwit2x casual users of bitcoin or what. I don't follow you now. If it's so obviously dead why are they bothering? So are you saying that the miners's switch will have no effect on what the nodes are running? Do you know that for a fact now?
@_date: 2017-09-14 05:58:13
i'm not actually sure that you have a clue what's going on in China. Crypto isn't useful for transferring money outside of China. It's subject to the similar regulations as banks, it's a bit more expensive (because of the spread when you buy and sell) and it's a bit faster (still takes a day or two to get your money out of Bitstamp in Europe, takes less than an hour in China). 
There are regulations governing the exchanges in that they must know who their customers are and are required to report "suspicious activity" to the regulators. Bitcoin is not a solution for that since last year already, if you try to move big money, you will be reported. Bitcoin is not widely traded in China either In light of this it's probably true that your comment about money laundering is wild specualtion also. They are limiting growth because they are slow and steady people, they like to be in control but at the same time they don't want to be left behind. Bitcoins effect on the Chinese economy/society is minimal and they'd like to keep it that way until they know more.
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:18:21
but this software called lightning that this post is about, I guess maybe this is where I misunderstand, that isnt the network? just one way to access the network? or is it creating its own network of lightning transactions?
@_date: 2017-10-12 08:29:30
Fuck, I hadn't heard of that. Now I'm in too. Shame I started sell my bitcoin for bitcoin cash. Guess I should be there before the hf :))

that article says, if it goes through, all blocks not signalling B2X will be orphaned. What does that actually mean. sure they could switch back and forth, but what's the loss in orphaning the blocks? I get that miners would happily have another thing to mine to slow down the difficulty adjustment, but that is known. What are the reprocussions for miners who dont signal when there is &gt;95% consesus. Why would any miner not signal, assuming that they are rational?
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:04:50
I appreciate the insight but just on the point of pool vs. miner, I think it is moot. All significant mining happens in pools so if the pool switches over, the all the miners in the pool will be mining the new coin.
@_date: 2017-09-14 07:10:28
it says that they comply with all local laws. it doesn't write out every law that they are in compliance with.

seens bitcoin is already being absorbed by the fed and wall street. not exactly the coexisting format of my dreams.
@_date: 2017-10-12 10:11:13
Bcc is cheap, btc is overbought. I think that merchants are going to get sick of core. This current attack will make it unusable for a few days again. I dont think lightning fork will do what it needs to do and we will have the scaling argument again, and lose market share again. Reasons like that. Meanwhile cash is quietly being offered by more vendors, more wallets, more exchanges. When people need something during the next crisis, it might be bcc, and it's so cheap it can't really go down anymore so it's a bit safer than btc currently. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:18:15
that's not exactly buying the dip, unless you mean you expect a dip before fight night... i guess my point is that this dip might be different. I know I know, it's been said before, but this time, this time, I think it really might be.
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:06:03
bitcoin core will have a massive dip if/when segwit2x wins in november. Would you buy that dip? THAT really is the question, or do you buy segwit2x?

The best metric I have so far is waiting for Bitpay to release their statistics but Bitpay are not even active in Japan! Who is processing Japanese payments?
@_date: 2017-10-10 08:08:53
Yea. Good points. I found a good article on bitcoin magazine just now too that explains it. Not believing the hype but if this is going to pump the value now again leading into it we should be understanding what's going on. Shame most of the discussion on here is not really discussion at all, just shit flinging. 
It does seem unlikely that the nodes would switch, I don't see a benefit for them at all. This big money getting into bitcoin changes things a bit. It's only a matter of time before they start the 'ole pump and dump like they do in gold, I have a feeling that this current burst is just that. Could be even worse after LN.
@_date: 2017-10-10 05:33:10
how was bitcoin cash different then in this case. Why do they seem to be living side by side now but with b2x it is being presented by many, in more technical terms, as all or nothing. Didn't miners also signal for switching to cash? are nodes just changing over and back?
@_date: 2018-04-02 06:02:55
On the other hand it shows that a single person still has the ability to easily wipe out massive amounts of wealth in crypto. If i had a few hundred million that I didn't want to lose, I'd probably keep looking.
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:59:14
Don't get greedy man. How much money do you want to make and is it worth risking all of your current stack? I'd also recommend splitting it up. Buy a few different crypto's and an index fund tracker. Maybe buy yourself some nice health insurance. Set yourself up so that you really won't have to worry about money at least. You'll be kicking yourself when you're 30 and you life goals have all changed and bitcoin has been replaced by a more modern cryptocurrency. 
Whatever you do you must use DOLLAR COST AVERAGING. Read about it.
Just because you don't really care about the money doesn't mean you should waste it by investing it poorly and essentially giving it to someone who does. You may as well just give it to charity.
When I was 19 I wanted money to be as little focus in my life as possible also. Taking that to it's logical conclusion now at thirty I have investments that make it so that pretty soon, work will be a choice for me, not a necessity. Think about it and good luck!
@_date: 2017-05-27 04:46:11
there are 40million starving now with drought in Africa dude. Find a decent charity and give them 5,000. Can google it to find decent charities that dont bleed money.
