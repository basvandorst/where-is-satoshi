great article and great thoughts. If we do all continue to trade we will be able to get back the losses. Stay united.

I am not sure they are really excited...I can't reallt believe they are excited for the wrong thing...I think they are just trying to focus people attention to another "name", in order to have everyday people to think in a negative way when they hear about bitcoin, and in a positive one when talking about blockchain...That's why I think art would be helpfull for spark people's curiosity and let them approach the technological topic from an easier way, through images and paintings. Art has always been used for educational purposes, it's just in the last decades that a lot of "famous" artists are doing crap instead of teaching and transmitting something.

Thank you! I am trying to introduce people to bitcoin through art. I know it's a difficult task, especially when the Bitcoin logo is an uppercase B with two lines through it...but I think bitcoin must be viewed from a different prespective to the general public, we have to spark people's curiosity, open their mind and help them approaching in an easier way. You can follow my art project both on instagram or on twitter! Cheers

�� Title: NET NEUTRALITY �� Technique: photography �� Dimensions: upon request
����Net neutrality is the principle that internet service providers and governments should treat all data on the internet the same, not discriminating or charging differentially by user, content, site, platform, application, type of attached equipment, or mode of communication. An example of a violation of net neutrality principles has been made in june 2011 when Wikileaks faced shut down from Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, American Express.
����The same year, Wikileaks started accepting bitcoin for donations.

Title: a bit leak
��Technique: acrylic on canvas (available also as screenprinted poster)
����In June 2011 Wikileaks begins accepting bitcoins for donations.
����In the previous six months, Visa, Mastercard and Bank of America have all cut off donations to the group PayPal and the banking arm of the Swiss postal service PostFinance have both frozen Wikileaks associated funds.
❌❌This has been a clear abuse of Net Neutrality.
����Wikileaks bypassed financial blockade with bitcoin.

I think it's important to create an iconography around Bitcoin, its story, the philosophy and the culture behind it.
Art is so easy to understand and images can teach to non tech people about this topic much more than long articles do.
This painting is about the abuse of net neutrality by visa, mastercard, paypal and bank of america in 2011 and the beginning of wikileaks accepting bitcoins.
Hope you like the project.

Hei Gary!
It's a pleasure to talk to you
Yeah you got it...I am italian LOL
I moved to London in January and yes, English is not my first language - but I promise I will improve!
I am a solo artist, but I ve used WE as another girls is working with me. She's the IT/tech girl, she's the one who's making the website and bitcoin payment system etc...She is not artistically involved but as I am publishing as Satoshigallery I prefer to use we.
Thank you very much for the links you suggested me.
So far I have seen cryptoart but they are far from my style. 
A guy that I appreciate a lot is cryptograffiti 
"your work is very edgy banksyish crypto orientated" - wow!
Banksy and Warhol are among my favourite artists and as you can/will see from my paintings I am really into street art and pop art style.
The main topic is to TEaCH = TEACH TECH.
It's so important to introduce people to technology (like bitcoin), explain the all story, and let them familiarizing with the concept.
I do paintings on commission but I have to agree with the subject. For example right know I am making 4 canvas of "It's one hundred trillion dollars bitches" (  for a collector who asked me to use different colours so I came with some proposals until he liked it.
Dimensions are upon request and I use two techniques: acrylic on canvas or screenprinted posters.
WE ;-)  are also coming out with a t-shirt collection and will be ready in one month. It's going to be really nerd/geek t-shirts crypto and bitcoin related but with NO bitcoin logo on it.
The quality is going to be excellent: earth positive t-shirts, 100% organic cotton, green ink, screen printing for better quality...Nothing to be related to the logo ones you can find now.
I think that as the community is growing, good quality products should be created in order to spread Bitcoin awesomeness!
Sorry but I am not familiar with Ethereum...I just bought some on Bitfinex, but can't teach you anything...
Have a great day/night

Hi! I am a solo artist.
Everything you see on the instagram profile is my own production/ideas.  Sometimes you see the digital file, but every piece comes into acrylic on canvas or on screen posters (depends on customer s preferences).
We love the concept, the philosophy of Bitcoin so much that we want everybody to understand the magic behind it. “Bitcoin is not just a currency, currency is just the first app.” Bitcoin must be viewed from a different perspective to the general public, we have to spark people’s curiosity, open their minds and help them approaching in an easier way.
It’s a difficult task, especially when the Bitcoin logo is an orange uppercase B with two vertical bars going through it.
That’s why we need art.
Because we need to bridge the gap between technical developers/experts/insiders and everyday people - even if they don’t fully understand the tech - who deserve to know that there is something amazing going on for humankind, that can free us all from banks and institutions, and can connect the entire world just in one click.
We are trying to contribute in this way to spread Bitcoin awesomeness, and in relation to this I'll come out with different projects.
Keep following and you'll help me!
Thank you for your interest

Thanx buddy, I have been mixing some different infos in the wrong way :-|
@_date: 2016-03-30 06:31:05
Thank you! Follow us and you'll help us in spreading bitcoin awesomeness! if you have any suggestion/opinion I would love to hear from you or any bitcoiners, I really need the support from the community in order to try to reach the majority of the people!
@_date: 2016-03-30 06:46:45
In this moment on instagram I am trying to make a sort of bitcoin story through images.
You'll have different chapters
chapter 1 = 2008 (the beginning)
chapter 2= 2009 (the genesis block)
chapter 3= 2010 (the pizza year)
and so on
So even not technical guys/girls can get through images a little from the cryptocurrency world, which is pretty hard to understand if you are not a tech person and are not "guided" by anyone.
Close your eyes and think about Bitcoin.
What do you imagine? What does your mind come to?
The bitcoin Logo right?
Some sell/buy graphics?
Bitcoin is MUCH more than this!
Whenever ther's a revolution, art becomes an important tools because it can explain to people the feeling they are living and can create an iconography around the theme in which the entire community can recognize themself.
Think about Andy warohl and the economic revolution (campbell soup, brillo soap, coca cola) or the Guernica by Picasso.
I am not comparing myself to them, but I am just saying that thanks to Satoshi we are in the middle of a technological/financial revolution and artists should thake care of that and tell something about Bitcoin which is more than just its own logo.
I am always talkative...

Why don't you transfer money from your HK bank account to Bitfinex (they are HK or Taiwan based as far as I remember) and then from your wallet to your UK bank account?...but they have a commission when you send money in and out...

Title:An alpaca to the moon Technique: acrylic on canvas Dimensions: 150 x 100 cm
(When you imagine bitcoin you just visualize an uppercase B with two lines going through it, but from an artistic and iconographic point of view there's much more that should be investigated! the philosophy, the anecdotes, the community behind bitcoin is what make this network so powerful. I am trying to describe it from an artistic point of view)
In 2011 a post on Slashdot described various goods and services could be purchased with bitcoins, among which Grass Hill Alpacas, that sold alpaca socks for bitcoin.
In march 2011 the most-widely known video that introduces bitcoin (What is Bitcoin? check it on youtube) uses an alpaca as a mascotte and described alpaca socks as one of the products bitcoin could buy.
"To the moon" is a sencence used by bitcoiners whenever the cryptocurrency is “going to the moon,” or set to raise in price dramatically.
In order to describe in an artistic way these concepts behind bitcoin, I made this painting.
Hope you like it!

Hi and thank you for your interest!
I know we are a little bit more expensive than the other bitcoin t shirts you can find online.
But the reason is because we have higher costs due to the fact that we use only earth positive t-shirts made qith 100% organic cotton, we only screen print (not digital ones) and use green inks.
We label everything, have a nice package and really care about details.
The chip heart one and the satoshi paper one are made with a special screenprinting technique which is called all over (and screens are difficult to be cut!)
This comes to a much better quality but...unfortunately a little bit more expensive..But it's worth it - and so far our customers are happy!
Hope this can explain this to you!
Thanx for your interest!

Bitcoin needs adoption.
Bitcoin needs enthusiasm.
Bitcoin needs whoever wants to help people understanding it in an easier way (maybe art could be a vehicle too?) in order to approach it.
We are not all "tech minds", and knowledge could be achieved also through images - and images can be very powerfull.
