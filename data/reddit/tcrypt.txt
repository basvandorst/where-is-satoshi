Decentralized exchanges are still in progress before being nearly as attractive as centralized ones. That's why people risk their money to use them. If people didn't use exchanges and trade btc would have no value or security so it's pretty shortsighted to outright blame them for their losses. But we definitely need large, advanced, liquid decentralized exchanges before it's realistic to not require traders to keep all funds under their own control.

1) It only requires 2 admin accounts if Bitfinex used 2
2) It appears the "2FA" is the Unlock operation which requires a OTP, but it's required to send money anywhere so unless they have a human sitting around personally unlocking this when people withdraw  funds they probably have it automated which means the OTP seed would be laying around and would not really be a 2FA.

Yeah a description of their setup would be great. If it's truly secure there would be no reason to discuss it and take feedback. From reading these APIs docks I'm very suspicious the setup was hardly any more secure than a hot wallet but done in a way that lets them handwave about "multisig".

Openbazaar 1.0 requires a libbitcoin server to interface with the Bitcoin blockchain. You can use your own but for convenience we host some for people to use by default so they don't need their own. Unfortunately they've given us a bunch of issues in the past although they're more stable now.

They could easily build out enough hashing power to have well above 50% and prevent any transactions or non-NSA blocks. I don't recall the current estimates on how much getting 50% of the hashing power would cost but it's definitely under a few dozen billion dollars.

Yes. It was very easy.

In practice miners communicate with each over the Relay network which minimizes the time it takes to tell the other miners about your block. The faster they know the faster they can start on the next block which means the previous block finder is more like to keep his/her reward.

As far as I understand it _could_ be changed at some point. The mining reward was 50btc so that's the amount that can't move. The reason it can't move is because all transactions must be spending Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs). The genesis transaction is embedded in the code, but for some reason Satoshi did not include the UTXO in the UTXO pool.

When people say Bitcoin wastes electricity they're wrong because the electricity is used as efficiently as possible. Saying Litecoin wastes electricity is accurate because it intentionally uses a less-efficient PoW.

No, what he's saying is to avoid SegWit unless you're opening a LN channel because using SW transactions allows for larger block sizes. If nobody used SW then blocks would still never be larger than 1MB.

A LN transaction is actually a chain of transactions between nodes in a chain going from the sender to the recipient .

No they didn't, I never said they did.
Yes it is a linked list. One where the entries are a collection of state changes. That's what a blockchain is. A Nash equilibrium isn't required for that. As far as we know it _is_ required for a functioning permisionless dynamic multiparty signature scheme for appending to a blockchain, but changing the mutation authorization protocol doesn't change the underlying data structure.

Thanks, that's the goal. My primary interest in OB has always been as an ecommerce protocol and that shouldn't prescribe things like which payment systems must be used, how discoverability must work, etc. The team has been great about helping realize that vision in an application that's immediately useful.
@_date: 2017-09-10 02:35:38
This is correct. We have a built-in SPV wallet that, like all SPV wallets, follows the chain with the most cryptoeconomically valid PoW (we check hashes + difficulty) but can't check full block contents. This is how all SPV wallets that don't use centralized nodes work. Users are free to (and I personally encourage) use their own full node. You can set it in the config file.

I'm not excusing Brian's behavior or views at all. He's an adult and he can do that himself if he likes. His words are his, not anybody elses. The other people on that list agree, but their words are still not anybody's but their own.
OpenBazaar is an open source project that anybody can contribute to. Brian can not unilaterally change things without causing a huge ruckus. There are other developers and other companies involved that will react and take corrective action as much as necessary. But I highly doubt that will be required. Neither Brian nor any other OB developers have the power to kill "your" chain at all. I'm sorry somebody said that needs to happen but that doesn't mean others agree.

Not directly through the protocol. We will make money by offering products and services on network. If OB is as successful as we believe it can be there's a lot of money to be made for people by offering things like arbitration, curated content, enhanced browsability, etc. We at OB1 have not announced our specific plans yet but we have something exciting to announce very soon!

@_date: 2016-09-17 18:57:51
I'm not sure what you mean about OB being "a provider". OpenBazaar _is_ a protocol, as well the name of the reference implementation of the software. We do not provide anything other than software capable of interacting with the network. The only things we sell on the network are stickers, tshirts, and pins. Somebody trying to sell drugs on OB is like somebody using Chrome to try selling drugs over http.
It is nice of you to be so concerned for us though.

Not sure. I also disagree that it's harassment but only the mods can give a clear answer. I've posted to get more info. I've talked to Luke and posted his comments multiple times (exactly like the mod thieflar had done with these Roger quotes). If that's harassment then thieflar is just as guilty.

Nothing they did or do behind closed doors can affect Bitcoin without the support of a much wider community.

Electrum is not a real SPV wallet. It connects to Electrum Server nodes that are fully validating. You must trust the majority of Electrum Servers you're connecting to.
The OpenBazaar wallet is as close to a real SPV wallet you can get without fraud proofs. Users validate block headers/PoW completely in exchange for not trusting Electrum (or some other software) nodes.
Bitcoin Cash isn't valid in terms of PoW/difficulty so we can, and do, detect it. Unless/until SegWit2X implements a detection mechanism or we have real fraud proofs there's no way to detect one versus the other without validating full blocks. You can read numerous reddit posts, mailing list posts, and Github issues about this problem. It's not just us that have to deal with it.

They're orthogonal. IPFS enables us to easily spread listings around to nodes that view them. Filecoin will theoretically allow vendors to _pay_ other nodes to _guarantee_ their content is stored.

OpenBazaar search engines owned by companies may not provide links to illicit goods but we can not disallow content on the network any more than Satoshi can prevent your Bitcoin transactions.

If a block is invalid your node will reject it and pretend it never happened. Nobody can sneak a block in that doesn't conform to the rules of your node without your node rejecting.

In 1.x, yes. That was the biggest drawback. In 2.0 (which is what is being demonstrated here) your computer does not need to be on all the time. We utilize IPFS to distribute listings around the network. If your computer is offline other nodes seeding your content fill in for you.

What "2x node client" are you talking about? It's a standard SPV wallet as defined in the white paper outside the obvious lack of fraud proofs that I wish we had but don't exist. It can not validate block contents. That's why we have an option to use your own full node.
@_date: 2017-10-06 19:59:12
Users can always use their own full node. If not they're using SPV and there's no way for us to know if a chain is S2X or not. If users are worried that S2X might become the dominate chain they should just use Bitcoin Core and they have nothing to worry about.

OpenBazaar is an open source project and protocol. Its development is driven by multiple companies but our company, called OB1, has gotten the most in investment (at least afaik/publicly). The person quoted in this thread is an OB1 founder and OB1 is the receiver of the mentioned DCG investment.
Many of us would continue to work on the project regardless of OB1 or any other company but it helps us get more done quicker. Investment helped me leave my previous job to devote my work to OpenBazaar full time. Without funding OpenBazaar 2.0 wouldn't be nearly as far along as it is. But the DCG funding is minimal compared to our other investors.
I actually think it's funny that people focus on DCG when our other investors are mostly done with Bitcoin. DCG seems like the last investor of ours that they'd criticize.

If they use a full node they can validate every single consensus rule to their heart's content. From the beginning we have allowed users to use their own nodes. They can't be tricked into accepting a fraudulent chain.


Of course there's no way for SPV to detect if the chain is 2X or not. Have you not been paying attention to all the shit going on with the btc1 repo and replay protection? SPV wallets not being able to determine the chain is a huge reason so many people here are upset about btc1. If they set the hardfork bit we could, but unless they make a change like that all we can do it wait for the fork to occur and then add in a manual checkpoint (which is developer centralization and very non-ideal).


I would love to hear from somebody that can't spell exactly how I'm a scammer.

That's a really fucking stupid reason to not participate in something you'd otherwise support. Plenty of successful and useful projects are led by assholes. OpenBazaar is developed and supported by many, many, more people than Brian.
@_date: 2017-09-30 20:45:16
Brian's opinions can't affect the code you run. He does not control your wallet. Our built in SPV wallet will follow the chain with the most work and valid block headers by default. But you can easily set your config to use a full node of your choice.

That's less than two people's yearly salaries. Not quite enough to buy any of us off. The people we've hired since then don't even have opinions on blocksize.
Also OpenBazaar has never had an investment. OB1 has, and perhaps other companies working on the project have, but the project itself has only ever received donations.

The person you're responding to is "they" and has never done anything to harm Bitcoin. Neither Sam, Brian, nor Roger or anyone else can change the definition of a word.

Bitcoin isn't what our product is "mostly based around" but regardless we're adding support for better coins ASAP.
 &gt; That's crazy though, because everyone at OB1 seems to be sharing the same meth pipe.
None of us are even close to each other so that'd be pretty difficult. Fortunately none of us smoke meth and if we did we could afford our own pipes. Even if we did share the same pipe, I'm not sure what communicable disease you think we have.

We're talking about tie breaking here, so near a plurality.

It does. Claiming it allows 4MB blocks is either a delusion or a deception from small block supporters. It allows up to 3MB of signature data and 1MB of other data. That does in fact allow more transactions per block because the block isn't storing signatures. But that doesn't make the block 4MB. It makes the block limit 1MB with pointers to a 3MB block.
I can put an 80 byte hash to a 10GB document in an OP_RETURN but that doesn't make the block 10GB.
The effect is _similar_ but not the same and claiming it is is false.

I have no say in split detection in 2X. I wish btc1 would set the hardfork bit but they're not and nothing I can say or do can change that. Until that happens the only way we can "detect" a split is to wait for it to happen and hardcode a checkpoint.

I didn't say I would do a better job. I have no interest in working with jackasses from Core when the world had moved on. I wasn't implying Bitcoin would be better with me, just that it would be far better off without Mark. He doesn't understand that Bitcoin is inherently political and only cares about capping transaction throughput so he can have a hipster coin that people hold to make money off of, not transact for trade. That's fundamentally opposed to the p2p digital cash system the majority of people got involved in Bitcoin came for.

That article was from Rusty Russell. One of the foremost Lightning Network developers and afaik Blockstream employee and/or contractor. He's very well known for his contributions to software.
I'm sorry if you thought it was "cancer" but it's straight from the horses mouth. Do you have information that I'm not aware of that Rusty is an idiot, cancer causing, or not a LN developer?
Edit: And after viewing your video and can say it's worthless as a counter argument against Rusty's points. I was there in the audience when Joseph gave that talk and understand/agree with all of it. It's a great piece of technology. It's a pretty natural progression of the Bitcoin technology. That doesn't mean it will be viable for the current demand any time soon. Perhaps that's acceptable. Perhaps the current consumer "coffee" demand is unimportant. That's understandable to me. That doesn't make LN a solution for large scale payments any time soon.

Sure, but many changes there are in wide agreement. Many are just housekeeping. Sure it adds some more risk, but if we HF we're already taking a lot of risk. The extra risk from many of those changes is small on comparison. Doing another HF later on is even riskier.
Unless we decide to not make any of those  changes for the foreseeable future doing them with an upcoming HF seems like the safest route. Not doing them is a valid option I think it should at least be considered. Weigh each change's risk vs its support and benefits.

An invalid one. The thing that matters is how the coins move, not who sent or received them. The coins can be only moved without a valid segwit signature as anyone can pay if a chain not enforcing segwit rules correctly overtook the main chain.

You will still be able to send transaction without the LN. How much the fees will be in the future is impossible to guess though.
I think the Lightning Network (or other hub-and-spoke micropayment channel networks) have a lot of advantages and will be a great asset, but I don't think that they'll take a catastrophic amount of transaction volume off the chain.
Can't be sure though, only time will tell.

My apologies for not understanding, but what do you mean "now trump administration says it"? What are they saying?
@_date: 2017-05-14 03:18:02
Yes. If he moved the coins himself with a signed transaction it shows nothing. It's only significant if the coins move without a signature, utilizing the anyone can pay setup. Segwit nodes redefine an opcode from meaning "anybody can move this anywhere without a signature" to "validate a segwit signature". So if Segwit stays dominant the coins can't be taken. If &gt;50% of nodes and miners reverted to pre-segwit the coins would be movable by anybody.
@_date: 2015-10-25 21:59:33
That is not fully known at this point. However, the theoretical vulnerability is that a quantum computer could potentially discover the private key for a given public key. If you don't reuse addresses then your public key is not revealed until you spend your coins making this type of attack unusable. They could perhaps recover the private key and say, sign as message as you, but your coins will have now been moved to a new address which they don't know the public key for.
Edit: This is still not ideal obviously, but should give some time to look for quantum-secure solutions.

Humans have to eat food and drink water to live. It's a bit unfortunate, but it's reality. The artist is (or rather, *should* be) free to hunt his own food and get his own water.

Fungibility is the property that some amount of one thing can directly substitute for the same amount of the same thing. In other words, all $5 bills are worth $5 USD.

This is a violation of one of the most important principals of currency.

I think we largely agree on the principal of keeping full nodes viable, but I'm wondering if you have a write-up anywhere of your thoughts on the real-world constraints. For example, do you think that it's reasonable for most users to run full nodes on their day-to-day computers for the next five years? What about requiring a modest dedicated computer, say around $250 in hardware?   I'm genuinely curious about your philosophy there.

I would highly suspect that if this went forward SW would activate first simply because it's coded, tested, and ready. If either side was screwed over I'd imagine it'd be the side wanting the HF. I think they recognize there won't be enough support for a HF unless there was some more give, like SW.

They just don't publish the blocks so nobody else can mine on top of them. The difficulty stays the same until they hit a difficulty adjustment, every 2016 blocks. Blocks would be a lot slower until then and then if they got there the difficulty would drop and blocks would get faster. There's a maximum amount the difficulty can change at once so it could take multiple periods to get back down to 10 minute blocks.
But number of blocks doesn't matter for determining the main chain, total work does. I doubt they'll perform enough work on the chain to cause a reorg.
@_date: 2017-06-04 18:13:35

We definitely need to get back to the times where Bitcoin didn't have so much corporate involvement and was only worth a few dollars. I remember back when Bitcoin was so secure you didn't even have to worry about people wanting to steal your coins because there was no point. Staying away from the fork the NY Accord will make is the easiest path back there.
TL;DR Bitcoin is about proof of work not proof of investment.

There certainly will be a chain split unless &gt;50% of miners manually upgrade to bip148 to keep passive nodes on the same chain as bip148 nodes. They'll still see non-SW blocks as valid.

It's interesting that so many of you bip148 supporters don't actually understand how it works.
Doing what you did does not enforce or otherwise help bip148. All you're doing is lying and saying you're running a bip148 node but you are not.

You people whining about paid trolls are a major reason you aren't taken seriously at the negotiating table. It's why you'll end up on Bitcoin with larger blocks or on a shitty bip148 chain with low to no value and/or a PoW change.

Fortunately the UASF is too thick-headed to realize that. Let them fork themselves off and dump their bitcoin for their worthless shitcoin. Once they lose their shirts and food money we won't have to put up with them any more.

@_date: 2017-06-10 22:34:40
No. The size of a transaction isn't related to the number of coins moved. It's the number of bytes required to describe the transfer which is unaffected by the amount you want to send. You spend coins by referring to past incoming transactions you've not spent yet, where to send them, and providing any transaction-specific data like signatures. You can't easily estimate the size without really understanding the internals or just building the transaction with software and looking at it.
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:12:30
Once the bip148 idiots fork themselves off and sell their bitcoin for their bip148 coin they'll be gone and the people that actually give the network value will proceed with larger blocks.

It seems that for the most part we're in agreement on things, but if a miner specifically refuses to mine a segwit block that's not bip 148's fault.
@_date: 2017-06-23 22:51:40
They'd only do that if the chain was at or reaching stagnation so a chain not doing it would be dead.

@_date: 2017-06-03 00:52:48


That's bullshit and either you know that and are lying are completely ignorant. There's nothing to enforce that transactions will be the same on both chains. The only known mechanism for ensuring that kind of thing is a blockchain, so that's out the window in this case.
If the bip148 chain manages to overtake the non-bip148 chain there will almost certainly be transaction losses. No matter how you spin it that's an attack. Just because it's an attack to implement a feature you want doesn't mean it's not an attack.
Bitcoin's security fails if &gt;50% of malicious actors are working together. People usually think of pools but in this case it's bip148 supporters trying
@_date: 2017-06-04 22:06:34
Don't tell them, just let themselves burn all their money so they won't be around anymore in the future.
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:54:58
I'm not following you. Bip148 has SegWit which has 2MB effective blocks but a 1MB base block limit still. It's only a new chain because they'll be ignoring valid blocks that everybody else accepts. A chain with a hashrate &lt; 50% is begging to be attacked. If bip148 doesn't have more support than that from miners they might as well change the PoW function.
@_date: 2017-06-11 00:36:13
Yes, the State of Montana trying to show their support of bip148 is a very likely and reasonable explanation. Nobody hates Chinese miners more than Montana.
@_date: 2017-06-29 21:00:13
Correct. Each node has a built in SPV wallet that the node owner is in complete control of.
@_date: 2017-06-18 03:07:05
No it isn't. PoS changes the validating mechanism but but not the role. It'll have the exact same issues in dealing with validators whether they're using stake or work as a resource.

Also send a small amount and transfer it back out to be sure you can/know how to send before you put a lot of coins on it

@_date: 2017-07-10 23:33:36
The problem for them is that they're not ready to test the HF stuff yet but somebody got the chain to that point. They can't use their own ASICs to slow down blocks only to speed them up; which is the opposite of what they wanted.
They still have time to finish the HF stuff up for as long as no block is found on that fork. If whoever wanted to cause them trouble wanted to do more they would mine on the 2x chain now before they're ready.
@_date: 2017-07-13 18:24:45

Yes they would be on different chains. The difference between soft and hardforks is unimportant if there's not wide concensus. From the perspective of the bip148 chain the main chain is a hardfork.

I know you bip148 people are all retarded so I'll help you out and let you know Jihan can't preform a 51% attack because it would require at least 51% of the hashrate which he doesn't have.

They like to deride anything that's had an ICO because it hurts their investment to have people buying other tokens. Most are scams but like you said, an ICO is no more an inherent scam than an IPO.

If the bip148 UASF fails to gain a majority of hash power by the end of August then I think the only chance of getting SW activated before summer of 2018 is the SW2MB.
Everybody hates to compromise, that's essentially what the word means. But the reality is that if bip148 fails the only chance of getting SW soonish is give in some to get wider agreement.
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:37:38
There's nothing to be done to support BU currently because it hasn't forked. It follows the same chain as non-BU.
@_date: 2017-06-15 01:41:58
Yep. That chain should definitely do a PoW change IMO.
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:11:04


 Sure, miners would have to collude. Do you think that's something that won't happen? If AntPool and BTC.com wanted to stop a 30% chain they could do so easily.


This is what I mean when I say you people don't understand what you're talking about.
If you think that's the worst they can do you're an idiot. They could orphan all blocks with transactions leaving that chain with 0 capacity. They could orphan all blocks that are not theirs and "activate" segwit but never let a SegWit transaction in.
There is a long history of mining attacks against coins. You should do some research. Start with lukejr since he's probably attacked more chains than anybody.

@_date: 2017-06-27 17:59:38
The point is that it's not a commitment, it's not genuine, and it's not "true signaling". There are a lot of nodes claiming to support bip148 that never will. If you guys don't start signaling for real nobody will know how much real support there is.
@_date: 2017-06-02 00:50:59
The nice thing about that model is having more, smaller, pools. A large pool could always misuse its contributed hash power acting against the end-miners wishes. Not that slush seems like the kind of guy that would do that, but it's possible.
@_date: 2017-06-17 00:58:42

@_date: 2017-06-01 12:05:59
Doubling capacity in the average case or 4x _at best_ (and I doubt it will happen more than a couple times if ever) will not fix the issues with stuck transactions. There will still be a fee markets and wallets need to get better at calculating an optimal fee. Most people believe mostly-full blocks is the new normal going forward.
SegWit helps with some requirements of some 2nd layer solutions like LN, which will help, but those are certainly not "simple solutions".

I am not in any way "desperate" to prevent a UASF. That does not mean the security issues should be ignored. I think it will almost certainly be attacked, but I'm not implying that's a reason it won't work. In the presented scenario, a 70/30 split will be dangerous for the 30% side. Trying to dismiss that as "lol. reeks of desperation" is foolish.
