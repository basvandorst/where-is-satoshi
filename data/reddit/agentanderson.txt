I use blockchain.info for storage due to how they push all their encryption to javascript.
I *would* use mtgox for buying/selling and storing small amounts of btc, were it not for this mandatory id verification.
CampBX is my current favorite exchange.

They don't require a driver's license for dwolla withdrawal, they appear to support ACH bank deposits (for $2 fee), you can deposit to CampBX with a personal check, and they seem to have a good security track record.

I just found a Mt Gox explanation: 
@_date: 2012-06-25 22:52:55
I'm legit, simply selling mined coins and withdrawing to Dwolla.
It's just given their reputation with security, I don't trust them with that additional information. Why is it "better" to give it to them, anyway?
Also, what do you mean by "the open market"? Is that the name of a site or are you suggesting I sell directly to buyers?
@_date: 2012-06-24 15:53:54
I stopped dealing with them when they wanted my driver's license for dwolla transfers.
I'm even less ok with the possibility of them leaking that info than I am over losing a couple dozen bitcoins.
@_date: 2012-07-25 21:25:26
CampBX might work for you.
They appear to support ACH deposits and USPS money orders (with $2 and 7$ fees respectively).
I know they also allow Dwolla withdrawals *without* needing a scan of your driver's licence. (The reason I stopped using MtGox)
@_date: 2012-10-14 06:03:04
Fuck MtGox
@_date: 2012-09-09 07:37:11
This is paired with a sister site tf2wh.com, which does use steam API logins. Your WHC get linked there. (I think this should have been all one main site, but w/e.)
You bid on WHC with BTC, then browse the catalog of items to order, reserve by spending WHC, and then a bot steam account makes a trade request with you to send you the item.

Something to maybe consider is that the supply is not going down, just the *growth* of supply is slowing down.

@_date: 2012-10-28 23:44:06
When I mailed them a check it was super-easy and probably faster than the verification wait of other exchanges.
IIRC, their Dwolla deposits require having an established deposit to Dwolla more than N days ago, but it's' still easier than mtgox.
@_date: 2012-08-08 16:31:58
Given MtGox's track record, I trust them even less than Dwolla with my info.
@_date: 2012-09-06 14:23:28
I still say that about mtgox.
Given that they were hacked multiple times, I don't trust them with my driver's licence info.

@_date: 2012-09-30 20:34:40
Create an account on CampBX, mail them a check with your account name on it, wait for them to deposit it as USD, trade for BTC using exchange system, withdraw to a wallet of your choice (my favorite is blockchain.info since it doesn't store passwords and my funds are recoverable if the site disappears)
It's slow because of the check-mailing, but the site seems more reliable than these other hooligans that get hacked every other week.

Is there a wallet.dat on the HDD?
It's the wallet.dat file that contains the info for authorizing outgoing transactions. Otherwise, assuming you just have a wallet address, all you can do is send money *to* it.
If it had a miner program on it, its configuration most likely pointed to a collaborative/distributed mining site. The wallet address could just be what the person set up as the payout address.
@_date: 2012-11-24 01:03:52

I was able to send them a check rather painlessly.
Their dwolla deposits are simpler than mtgox last I checked (no driver's licence, SS, fingerprints, or colonic map), but you still need to have "at least one deposit to dwolla older than 30 days"
@_date: 2012-11-23 23:57:30

Many TF2 sellers are sick of people doing chargebacks on paypal, and won't let you buy with it unless you have tons of reputation. Bitcoin's nonreversible transactions eliminates this risk to the seller as long as the buyer still goes first.

Just brainstorming: Don't miners typically just access an HTTP web service on the mining pool?
e.g. my Phoenix miner config file (running on Slush pool) contains:
If you could somehow create a url that targets the proxy, but the proxy reroutes the request to the pool, then mining might be doable.
Oh yeah: Are you really planning on mining on a laptop? I'm guessing you'd only make a couple cents per day.
@_date: 2012-09-02 01:59:28
My attempt at a dumbed down explanation:
All amounts are stored "in the cloud", but only you have the randomly-generated passcode to change certain amounts, AKA "make payments".

Correct. Both the heater and GPU are electricity-to-heat conversion devices (both providing 1kWh of heat per kWh of electricity), but one of them provides computation as an added benefit.
I also ran it quite a bit in the summer when the reward was still 50 since the benefits outweighed my entire electric bill.
I'll probably be quitting mining in the spring, unless something changes with prices to motivate me otherwise.

Do you seriously think that there's no difference between using a password in javascript and sending it to a server?
Client-side code that never sends your password to a server is much  more trustable than client-side code that does send it to the server.
If a site only keeps your password in the world of javascript, the people running the site can't do jack shit to do anything with your encrypted data. 
(Of course the javascript has to be trusted to be secure; but **javascript can be reviewed, server code can't**.)


No, it could be client-side code doing opening it.


The whole fucking point is that **we can't prove that it's not logged if it's sent to the fucking server.**

Ah, so it's a threshold (in a similar manner as the mining protocol itself) but with a lower difficulty?
I'm assuming that a pool also has to keep bookkeeping data to prevent a miner from re-submitting the same nonce multiple times.

This thread is discussing the possibility of changing bitcoin protocol to have a hypothetical hash algorithm that makes ASICs useless, which *would* make CPUs much more powerful. (Remember that mining difficulty is relative)
Just parroting "CPUs aren't as powerful as ASICs" is missing the whole point.

I have a theory that price increases after dips are inherently delayed due to the fact that it's so damn hard to move fiat into exchanges.
That is: after a price dip people would love to rush to buy (creating a more reactive market), but they have to move dollars through dwolla et al., causing them to wait 3 to 30 business days.

This would be a neat **option** to be able to spend BTC with paypal-accepting merchants.

I like CampBX's lack of bullshit in my experiences with them.
I just mail them a money order, wait a few days, and bam, I have exchange dollars ready to trade with. No wires, no ID verification, no interacting with strangers.
(Max of $1000/day transfer with no ID though. But it's enough for my needs)

Yes, but no more than that. It's an interesting "what if" to say the least.
We already had a [similar scenario in March]( where a bunch of mining pools didn't get an update that permitted larger blocks, and caused a long blockchain divergence. There was a somewhat rapid consensus that the older version be reverted to for a while. Many exchanges and merchants suspended operations until things got sorted out.

That's not a fork within bitcoin.
An example of a fork within bitcoin would be 50% of people following the old protocol and 50% following a new incompatible one that uses the same preexisting blockchain. The blockchain would have two longest branches, each being the "most correct" for that protocol. Any coins in existence before that fork would basically be cloned into two parallel universes.

As mentioned by digitalh3rmit, it's a simple redirection to a btc-e page with certain querystring parameters.
btc-e.com is apparently stupidly coded to insert certain querystring parameters into the page verbatim without sanitizing them. In this case it's a script tag (which immediately executes and has full access to your cookie/account capabilities).
If btc-e's new "Functional confirmation of the withdrawal through the mail." security feature is enabled on your account (and if it works), then it should help mitigate this risk.

Companies could start bitcoin banks, which offer people the warm fuzzy feeling of promised insurance and safeguards against the customer's goof-ups.
These banks could then also act as payment processors, just moving numbers around internally among themselves, with *"no waiting for traditional sluggish bitcoin transactions"*.
More and more merchants would find this easier for small transactions, and it becomes widely accepted, moreso than actual bitcoin.
The banks, meanwhile, are offering loans of their virtual bitcoins, greatly exceeding the actual backing bitcoins. Eventually Robot Nixon decides to eliminate the bitcoin-backing of the bitdollar in 2071.

See my [post below]( It appears that your password is sent to the server when creating a wallet (along with the encrypted private key). It's conceivable that they store that password when they receive it.
Your private keys would then be a completely within their reach, as they could use that password to decrypt them.
