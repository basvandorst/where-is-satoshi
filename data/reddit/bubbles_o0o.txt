The easiest way is using either of these two services:
1. 
2. 
- Create an account.
- Enable two-factor authentication.
- Link your bank account.
- Buy bitcoins.
There will delays of several days between some of the steps while waiting for them to process shit.

The whole wait 10, 20, 60? minutes for confirmation is extremely confusing to merchants.  They need something that works as fast as credit cards before they will adopt it.
@_date: 2016-04-13 19:32:04
Will take a while to get merchants onboard given the fact that its not even released yet.  Bitcoin didn't have a lot of merchants accepting it before it got released either.

I was not advocating a particular blocksize.  I was simply wondering why there is no discussion or proposals for eliminating centralization of miners.  There has been a metric fuckton of argument over how to prevent it.  But it's already here.  Where is the discussion on how to eliminate it?
To address your point - downloading the blockchain is a different problem than transmitting new blocks.
@_date: 2015-12-31 05:21:56
It's not a matter of trust.  
With the recent focus on scalability, the most divisive factor has been to not increase the blocksize because that will further centralize miners and weaken security.
If that security is so paramount, and it has already been breached, why is there no focus on fixing it via software changes?
@_date: 2015-12-23 22:44:42
I don't think it's fair to call them failed developers just because they have a different opinion on how a particular software project should evolve.  If that is the criteria for failure, then every single developer that has ever existed can be called a failure, including Satoshi.  If you look at the early versions of Bitcoin, you can see that he made some poor design decisions.  
Now if a developer consistently makes the wrong decisions, then you could call them a failed developer.  But that is obviously not the case for Gavin and Mike.  If it were, Bitcoin would already be dead since they were instrumental in getting it to this point.

I guess I was lucky to have pulled out all my coins when I started seeing warning signs that something wasn't quite right.  
I still hold coins on CoinBase and Circle as they seem pretty legit, but most of my coins are on Trezor and paper wallets.

Out of two core developers I've got 5 words.  
3 words from maaku7 and 2 from you.
I know you are busy, coding core and reading posts here, but i think I speak for a lot of interested parties here.  
My words have obviously resonated with you guys and perhaps you can elaborate a bit on how, exactly, you will solve the centralized mining problem.  If you can't, just say so.  It's ok.  Its a hard problem.  We can't figure it out either.  If you need time thats ok.  We kinda just need to know where it stands.  Thats all.
@_date: 2015-12-31 07:15:10
Absolutely.  Core devs build software.  They (usually) suck at technical evangelism.  We need technical evangelists that translate technical details into a wider audience at appropriate levels.  This is how the industry operates and bitcoin doesn't.
@_date: 2015-12-31 06:46:23
I read Maxwells summary after the scaling conf, and the roadmap, but there was no clear explanation of how that would reduce centralization of miners.  The other references you mention are not digestible by people who aren't fluent in the details of bitcoin.  
I've been a developer for nearly 20 years, but I simply don't have time to study at that level to gain a basic understanding for me to make decisions.  If I can't do it, then 99% of people can't do it. 
So no, that is not an acceptable answer.  What we need is an understandable description of how centralization of miners problem can be solved.  That is why I asked.  There is none.  This is a large gap this community needs to solve somehow.  We are missing the middle component.
@_date: 2015-12-02 08:44:16
Bitcoin can't rationally increase in value until two things happen:
1) it becomes visa level scalable
2) confirmation times decrease
Until then it can only act as a settlement layer, which certain core developers advocate either because they lack the ability to achieve those goals or they have an agenda.
We all knew bitcoin would sustain massive attacks.  We thought it would be from threats from the established banking sector or governments ability to control the monetary supply.  The true threat has come from it being subverted from within, towards corporate goals, the antithesis of satoshis aim.

I also wrote a bot to trade using my own algorithm similar to a "regression to the mean" strategy and I'm up, $40 lol.
Make sure you backtest it against historical data to see how it performs in the real world.

Parallels are inconsequential.
Look at the fundamentals to get a better grasp of the potential of this new technology.

Don't do it.  They don't need that info.  Your bank doesn't even know your password (it should be hashed or you need to find a new bank).
@_date: 2015-12-31 09:18:51
In the meantime, you, and me, have absolutely no understanding of how they are going to solve the centralized mining problem.
Most likely, they don't either, its hard.  Lack of communication ain't helping.

Im OP and i didn't' ask this question.  Your questions are redundant im not quit sure what your point is

I know you guys are busy.  But could you provide a quick overview (or point me to one) of a proposed solution?  Is it a core change to Bitcoin or some kind of layer 2 solution?

It's gonna be proven.  This ain't rocket science.  It's arithmetic.

I don't know... C and C++ are a bit fancy for my tastes.  I'd prefer assembly.

Oh, I get it.  I'm not allowed to ask questions unless I demonstrate action towards that end.
Attempting to raise conversation to find a solution for that issue is action towards that end.
Perhaps I can recommend some [action]( for you.

Soft forks are evil.  Not cool to put in a change under the radar.  They should be abolished.  But the lazy prefer them cause they are easy changes for those currently in control.

People probably ask because this is a new and controversial form of currency and store of value.  They want to judge your level of commitment, and bitcoins possible overall validity, by the amount you were willing to risk investing.  
Just say you have some.
If they keep pressing the issue, you could say, "I have invested X amount into bitcoins.  How much have you invested in stocks, bonds and savings accounts?"
@_date: 2016-01-17 20:18:47
Sure.  There is a 1MB block size limit.  1MB + 1 byte &gt; 1MB.  
Let me know if that was too sophisticated a proof for you and I'll try to bring it down to your level.  
@_date: 2016-01-08 08:14:02
Perhaps, in the future that will happen for mining.  How about centralized dev?  Really difficult to decentralize that.  Not sure it's ever been done.
@_date: 2016-01-22 07:38:20
can I nack that or will i be shunned to the netherworlds?
@_date: 2016-01-06 06:31:28
How do we know if a miner doesn't validate blocks?  But since we do know, can we automatically reject blocks from these cheating miners?
@_date: 2016-03-13 23:32:29


We got like 5 guys creating all blocks with PoW in the most inefficient manner possible.

Sorry, I lost sight of your original question, which was a good question.  
All I do know is that theory without application is useless.  You can argue the merits of god, i don't fucking care if it can't make a difference in life.
@_date: 2016-01-17 00:19:08
You understand people feel like they had no choice but to seek out a new dev team because the current one became unresponsive to their needs?
This happens all the time in the corporate world too.  The initial founders get thrown out because they fail to respond to the demands of those ultimately in control.
This is why people are desperate for alternatives even if they are flawed in your eyes.   People are rejecting a perceived ivory tower dev group that won't make rational compromises.
@_date: 2016-01-22 07:56:42
A picture of people at a large table.  Some from banks.  Some from bitcoin companies.  This is the best you got?
@_date: 2016-01-17 07:31:53
You can't get away from a core group of developers building it.  But the market has spoken.  If the current group of devs don't perform as needed, new ones will be found.  We can change to a new dev group.  So in that sense, it's not centralized, as core will soon find out.  Did that answer your question?
@_date: 2016-01-17 19:16:24
The market is going to teach core a lesson.  Hopefully they will quickly escape their bubble of arrogance and learn their lesson well.  They have technical talent - they are going to learn more is needed.  
This shit happens all the time.  Fucking developers.  I was the same way when I started over 20 years ago.  
@_date: 2016-01-25 04:23:26

You seem to have an agenda you wish to impose upon us intellectually inferior individuals.  And that is ok.  I like to learn.  I'm not really that well versed in monetary theory.  I will give you that soapbox to elaborate your ideas.  I welcome them.
I guess my only point is that Nakamoto raised the bar in a way that theorists have never done.  He built something and released it.  Here we are.  Now if you have some superior theory that should, but has yet not been implemented, step up and make it happen.  Until then, it just grand theory.  Pretty to think about.  Useless to all.  That is a big difference.
@_date: 2016-01-06 08:38:05
But if we know its from a miner that doesn't validate blocks we can reject their block and wait for a block from a miner that doesn't cheat.   
@_date: 2016-01-22 09:37:01
ic i'm not talking to anyone with a dev perspective.
if you had any dev experience you would realize that this whole experiment is just that, an experiment for currency and value.  many compromises were made and nothing is concrete.  lots of holes were in the original codebase, and many were found.  
we are still finding many more.  mining centralization is a possible fatal flaw as is scalability.  neither were addressed adequately in the original and current implementation.  
one other potential fatal flaw no one talks about is price volatility.  which with  sufficient resources the price is susceptible to a majority attack, which i think we will see within one year barring one of the other attacks doesn't destroy it in the meantime.

well fuck.  i've been wasting my best minutes replying to a robot?  i'm drunk but have have immense wealth of info to provide.  i have more dev experience than all of (the top 3) core devs combined.  
i see the patterns of insulation they are exhibiting.  they are programmers without higher levels of discipline.  we are seeing engineering for engineering sake.  dangerous road to go down.  nash had theory.  nakamoto had theory combined with actual real-world practicality.  satoshi made many compromises just to get this shit released.  it was released imperfect.  he wouldn't have stonewalled a 100% capacity raise for risky solutions down the road.
@_date: 2016-01-22 07:50:31
luke-jr has the answer and submitted a pull request to bitcoin-classic, which was categorically rejected.  Maybe core can incorporate it?
@_date: 2016-01-22 08:09:59
Nash didn't do shit other than theory, kinda like how core is suffering from analysis paralysis.  Nakamoto said this theory ain't perfect, but here's something you fucks can experiment with.  Guess who's ideas we are actually using?
@_date: 2016-01-22 08:14:15
Nash couldn't program his self out of a wet paper bag, which ironically we find cores mind in (head in sand).  So at least we know this ain't nash's code.
