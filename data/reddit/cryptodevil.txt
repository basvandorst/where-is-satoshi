The 'chainstate' folder needs to be added to MSE exceptions.

Absolutely it was, the file pathnames given by MSE were:
I have now added the chainstate folder as an exception, restored the two files from MSE's quarantine and now my Bitcoin core wallet is reindexing the whole thing again. Hopefully, by the time it is finished, all will be well with my wallet again.
This is the 64-Bit wallet, just in case it's important to know.

Because I've tagged his bitcointalk account with negative trust in order to prompt a reaction from him. His response was to claim he is not connected to the exchange in anything other than a technical capacity.

You're welcome, I'm mostly concerned about how this particular issue appears to have cropped up in multiple claims which all end with BTC-E making unsupported accusations of fraud and then just closing the tickets. If they have evidence these account recovery tickets are being raised fraudulently then they need only post the proof and the scammers will be exposed, otherwise their continued refusal to properly resolve these tickets just ends up making them look like every other bitcoin exchange which invariably went tits-up shortly afterwards.
I've emailed the github contact as you suggested, to ask if they have a more substantial connection to BTC-E for Alexey other than the part-time technical role he is willing to admit to at this point.

WRT this statement on the gitbhub page:


Alexey is the main representative for BTC-E, possibly the original developer
He denies being anything more than an occasional technical consultant. Is there evidence which links him to BTC-E in a significant capacity?
