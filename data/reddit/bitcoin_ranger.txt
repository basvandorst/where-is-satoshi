The chain with the most value will ultimately be the one with the best development like any other industry. As core has the best developers and thus the best development that chain will have the most value. The miners will quickly switch to this chain when they raise this. Seriously BU is shit, why do we pretend otherwise?

Memorydealers couldn't keep up as he doesn't know anything about tech or economics. Only claim to fame is hearing about bitcoin early. How can you negotiate with  an idiot? this is like WW2 appeasement which will not work. Block size is a red herring. Won't scale. Only solution to real scaling is off chain. That is the logical end point. If we can't have a decentralised lightning network it will be a semi centralised one with trusted custodians. That is what will come by blocking segwit.

Nope. Developers create software which users want creating value for the token, increasing the price. The miners are paid in the token, not fiat, so their revenue is based on users wanting the token. If BU forked off their development will stagnate,  demand won't exist for their token and miner revenue on that chain will drop. Darwin Award winners

Generally block size debate is a waste of time as it can't scale enough ever. A few MB increase is nothing. Off chain is the only way to scale properly. Lightning network is a great invention ready to go.  Fork would be stupid and damage the bitcoin brand. Technophobes would not understand 2 bitcoins. BU lack common sense. They are brazen alt coin pumpers, shorts and bitcoin haters. If u hate bitcoin best place to be is hang out in the other sub.

They basically want to remove best developers in crypto from the project and centralise development. Don't seem to realise their code is inferior altcoin which doesn't work. BU aiming for crypto Darwin Award

If people spend time reading and learning it is the preferred solution

PSA Please send all complaints to miners who have not activated segwit
