The FBI opened an investigation on me and came to my dorm room 3 weeks into my freshman year, I had my computer and electronics seized. They subpeanued my roommate in front of s federal grand jury and about 8 months later I received notice that the FBI closed the investigation. The best part is the FBI doesn't have to tell you what they are investigating you for or why. It was a stressful 8 months even though I knew I had not done anything to warrant an investigation, I could only imagine how terrible it must be if you had done something illegal and the FBI begins investigating you. Best part was I was told by my attorney that if I were to be indited they would most likely find me while I was in class. There's nothing that could help you focus more on class then knowing the FBI could potentially pull me out of class to arrest me.

Since what has PayPal been considered a good thing and wasn't this a huge reason for BitCoin was not having to use PayPal to send money since they can close your account and take your money without any reason?

Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe all this is configured in the Erupter Cub [as seen here](

There you go.  I am seriously considering this, I just don't know if I have the time with my work schedule.

I know this is r/BitCoin but I think [Amazon Payments]( also offers a great alternative to PayPal.
