I was one bagholder in the last bubble. So sure it's a gamble. 
  If the bubble burst: don't sell for less than you bought. ;) Doesn't matter how long it takes to get to the old price again, just hold them until they are worth that much again, or more.

We once saw a $2xx to $8x fall in the last few months. I'm just saying.

I'll get downvoted like crazy but you bought in right in the bubble.. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 12:47:17
Yea, I know. But with a few months between. And I'm NOT saying, that it was wrong to buy in at the bubble. I'm just saying, that it's not the best choice. ;)

Maybe. :D
@_date: 2013-11-06 11:56:24
Short term, maybe. Long term, no. It depends what you are striving for. ;)

Ich hoffe doch, dass Litecoins folgen.

Do you do the same thing with EUR&lt;-&gt;USD transitions? No, people always have the exchange rates in their minds. But 1BTC will still be worth 1BTC in 1 year.

Will you accept LTC NEAR in the future?
@_date: 2013-07-13 15:25:12
So when you are out shopping groceries you check the exchange rates beforehand. If they aren't that good for you you won't buy?

Looks pretty solid! :)
@_date: 2013-11-06 13:10:45
Sure. Let's just wait and drink tea in the meantime. ;)

Can someone explain to me what an ETF is? Thanks. 
@_date: 2013-07-08 21:31:02
Thank you. And how does it generate money for the share owners? 
@_date: 2013-11-14 07:53:42
Well it isnt a real exchange. It's more a marketplace. I sold there BTC for about 1000€. No problem so far. 
@_date: 2013-07-08 21:52:48
Okay, thanks. 
@_date: 2013-06-27 18:24:57
I nearly never turn it on..

Be sure to buy from fully verified members with some experience/many transactions.
