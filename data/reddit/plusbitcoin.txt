it is not the case, tried several times

Oh, and by the way he works for Ripple.
@_date: 2016-04-04 07:01:06
We collected some infos here

[Advanced Cash]( Mastercard still works, but has crazy high fees for Bitcoin (hidden in exchange rate).
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:00:34
How about people just taking huge profits?
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:00:11
please remind me about this when bitcoin bubble bursts
@_date: 2015-12-11 10:32:38
Try coinurl.com
@_date: 2015-12-11 10:30:16
Try [bitcoin advertising networks]( Some of them extend a bit from bitcoin only websites towards more general public.
@_date: 2015-06-10 14:32:23
So good that they underestimate the potential of crypto's. They will start loosing market share faster this way.
@_date: 2018-08-14 10:57:09
It is not a very good idea since you will loose at least 20-35%. But if you must, here are some services describer that offer [Paysafecard to BTC conversion](
@_date: 2016-01-13 21:21:37
This is one of those news that does or does not tell anything about bitcoin future, but bitcoiners go mad about it and just see "go to the moon" things.
@_date: 2016-01-30 15:23:28
247exchange and circle have thorough verification process
@_date: 2016-01-08 08:39:36
If I understand this correctly, they have no fees for these deposits? There are fees afterwards when you want to exchange USD into bitcoin, but this is way lower than other [buy bitcoins with credit card]( services. Other guys charge 4-6% for this. Can please somebody confirm that?
@_date: 2016-01-28 09:27:11
Here is the info
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:44:34
what do you expect from chinese markets?
@_date: 2016-06-18 14:55:52
The security is in general based on the idea of waiting for some time before you can withdraw your coins. Imagine that the DAO scenario happens to bitcoin and that bitcoin is quickly loosing value - and that you can not withdraw for 2 days. 
@_date: 2017-01-16 12:09:26
We have up to date information [here]( we also display how much will an exchange cost you.
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:04:14
I use Bitwala. Here are more
@_date: 2016-06-30 21:36:28
I don not believe a single word about these guys, it is all internal PR. 6 months ago they published a PR article about their affiliate program as to be "minutes away". They still do not have it.
@_date: 2017-08-08 06:53:10
I can't believe I watched this till the end.
@_date: 2017-08-06 18:42:11
@_date: 2017-01-05 10:22:02
at 5500 I can retire
@_date: 2017-08-06 21:59:42
"BTC-USD has broken to a fresh all-time high on August 5, as Asian markets dominated the bullish charge" ... it looks like they already contributed to this price.
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:54:08
yes they sell BTC via BTM ...
@_date: 2016-12-14 12:30:47
since circle is down, I wanted to try them
but signup link returns an error to me
so much for "award winning"
@_date: 2015-08-20 07:27:13
This is probably the worst exchange I've seen for a while.
It goes like this. You sign-up. You enter everything what they want. You verify your bank account. You initiate the deposit. It goes really really smoothly till here and you say to yourself, finally a great exchange.
Then your deposit gets rejected. They do not tell you why. You contact them via email and ask why your deposit got rejected. They tell you you need to send them even more documents. You send them more documents. 
You place the deposit again. Your deposit gets rejected. You contact them via email and ask why your deposit got rejected again. They say, that you should link your Facebook or Linkedin or Paypal, so they can verify you more. You do it.
You initiate the deposit. Your deposit gets rejected. 
Since you told your bitcoin mailing list about the service, you got about 200$ in commissions. But you can not get those commissions, because you can not make a deposit. Because you can collect them only if you buy bitcoins from them. But you can not buy bitcoins from them.
You give up. Since they pissed you, you tell them they should cancel your account. They ignore you. 
Your account is still there. You can not delete your account.
They simply do not do what they say.
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:21:25
There is only one 100% safe option for doing this and that is [VirWox]( exchange. The other, not 100% option, is this section of [LocalBitcoins](
We wrote recently about this [here](
@_date: 2015-08-20 07:39:42
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:24:21
I did not have any problems with them so far.
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:00:48
cloud mining is not a scam
@_date: 2015-07-02 14:25:20
We have recently posted this on [+Bitcoin]( We'd like to warn users who want to exchange Skrill to Bitcoin for known scammers. These are bitodex.com and bitin.co – they claim that they accept Skrill and Paypal for bitcoins, but you will never get your bitcoins (the site even suggests that you send the money as a gift via PayPal and not as for goods and services, and gift transfers on PayPal cannot be disputed!)
@_date: 2016-02-08 16:07:57
Few ideas.
@_date: 2016-02-04 21:00:12
just withdraw now, no problem
@_date: 2016-02-01 11:06:24
Bought and paid with bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-02-22 08:27:03
I totally agree, but still my favourite exchange as they provide the cheapest method to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-24 21:29:41
Just stay away with Celery. You will do everything what they want , you will verify etc, but your deposits will get rejected.
@_date: 2017-04-18 12:34:19
Here are a few others
@_date: 2016-02-04 21:01:12
just withdraw, no problem at all
@_date: 2016-02-12 13:24:29
They are very good, I use them al the time.
@_date: 2016-02-19 12:49:55
circle, the cheapest way to buy bitcoins
@_date: 2017-04-10 08:07:51
Can somebody explain how close are we to the disaster?
@_date: 2017-04-24 19:29:38
@_date: 2016-02-01 10:20:54
creditcard: not possible
best option for you would be virwox, but it costs a lot
other ideas
@_date: 2016-02-07 14:41:37
"It now typically trades at between $200 and $300."
Please let me know where.
@_date: 2017-04-23 16:34:05
great out of the box thinking
@_date: 2016-09-12 11:05:02
Unfortunately the wallet adress you get for a deposit shows some activity ... so people send money ...
@_date: 2016-09-12 08:05:02
Is this a scam? Anyone tried it? If it is a scam, I wonder why the have such a powerful PR - Nasdaq, etc writing about them.
@_date: 2016-09-14 06:58:15
@_date: 2016-09-09 20:11:31
Because everything is red, Bitcoin is green.
@_date: 2016-09-15 07:17:41
Buy, hold, put in bitcoin savings account, get interests and wait.
@_date: 2016-09-18 20:41:03
As I said earlier ...
@_date: 2016-09-15 07:16:14
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:34:27
I am aware of this. Nice list. according to your list, the only debit card that works with BTC topping is Bitnovo for EU and BITpay for USA? Would be great if you could add a column "Top up with".
@_date: 2016-09-19 19:29:43
as far as I know, you can not buy bitcoin with Paypal at Bitpanda
@_date: 2015-11-24 10:56:37
plenty of pages that explain just that, including ours
the old wiki at  is not maintained, but can be by everyone who wants, so why another page instead of updating the old one?
@_date: 2016-10-03 09:24:26
And here is the link to the pitch directly
@_date: 2015-11-11 19:31:11
Oh, there is blockchain explanation too.
@_date: 2015-11-19 09:38:19
I suggest Virwox if you talk about smaller quantities as there is 20% fee, but you will get bitcoins instantly and anonymously. You can find more info [here](
@_date: 2017-05-10 12:56:35
See "Shopping at Amazon with bitcoin" section.
@_date: 2017-05-11 18:32:45
I love bitstamp, but look at the fees for cc buying.
@_date: 2015-10-22 10:18:16
Due to this fact, it's rising. 275+ at bitstamp.
@_date: 2017-07-06 20:19:38
I don't agree with most of the guys here. I have contracts with all mentioned and it is profitable. If you want to buy some cloud mining, PM me for details and I can give you promo codes for discounts.
@_date: 2017-07-06 20:20:21
because they sell hardware, not bitcoins
@_date: 2017-07-14 08:24:21
thanks for this info
@_date: 2017-07-14 08:36:51
Another partnership
@_date: 2017-07-15 10:41:53
I speak generally, but if you want: Bitstamp, Bitfinex, Cex, Gdax.
@_date: 2017-07-13 17:26:01
BCU rising to 250$.
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:55:48
read the question first, then answer

@_date: 2016-07-20 07:22:57
I don't think so if you get an extra % of interest rate.
@_date: 2016-07-11 15:18:35
It looks like people are sending money ...
@_date: 2016-07-17 05:33:05
@_date: 2015-10-20 11:52:29
Thanks for the info, will check them out. Did you withdraw also?
@_date: 2017-06-19 12:35:30
Indacoin is the quickest as there is no verification needed, but it comes with the price
@_date: 2016-07-18 14:17:14
