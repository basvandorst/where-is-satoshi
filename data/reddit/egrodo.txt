Nah, the link was fake.

Great, they opened their service to everybody.. Except those under the age of 18. Hell all I wanted was to use this as an insured hot wallet for quick transactions on the fly. Nope, can't do that even though I have a debit card and SSN and all the required documents. Great service but I'll be sticking to Coinbase.

That would be the most stupid thing he could possibly do.

I just bought an expensive laptop off Newegg using Bitcoin on Coinbase last night… no problems yet, already shipping. Screw me right?
@_date: 2014-07-07 07:21:10
You are 15 right?
@_date: 2014-06-28 09:12:27
You are way too excited.

Where are we supposed to start?
@_date: 2017-04-19 19:11:17
I see, that sounds like a good idea. So the update is going through for sure but people could still choose to use the previous update, segmenting the community?
@_date: 2017-04-18 22:14:33
I've been subscribed but not following the scene. There a TLDR for this?
@_date: 2013-10-23 22:19:45
6.1+ only :( I'd rather have my jailbreak, oh well.
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:02:47
Seeing this, IDK if I want to use Coinbase to sell. Say I want to sell one, and I want it fairly quickly/easily. What would be the best exchange to use? 
@_date: 2013-08-03 06:17:50
Highland here. When literally everyone in the neighborhood is Mormon non-Mormons don't really matter.
@_date: 2013-11-23 17:14:58
Oh, I have a bank account and paypal and all that. I didn't know that you didn't have to meet in person, thanks. What's the point of buying "local" then?
@_date: 2013-11-17 08:06:44
Hey, I was there. Funny. Soon thereafter there was another begging thread that accounted to nothing. Sad.
@_date: 2013-11-16 16:36:10
Oh I… I feel stupid for not realizing that. I'm guessing that litecoin is the main and most viable altcoin? I wouldn't be mining just to sell, I'd probably just want a few to play with, just in case I suppose. I'll start researching, thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:36:19
Oh wow, I can't believe I didn't know about this. Provo is only a few towns over, I'll definitely be looking into the places they talk about. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:51:19
Sure, that's what I told her. None of her stocks have increased nearly as much as my one Bitcoin has over the past few months. Looking at the website, I sure have a lot of research to do before I feel comfortable with doing it. Again, never held this much money before, I'm extremely overly cautious. 
@_date: 2013-06-01 08:06:02
 Check her post history and you'll be pleasantly surprised.
@_date: 2013-11-28 05:11:15
I'm in the market for a new gaming mouse, anyone know where I can buy a good one with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:59:49
Woah, I gotta agree with that guy, that Breaking Bad print is sick. I think I found an item for my girlfriends Christmas gift! If I buy tonight any idea when it'd arrive?
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:42:46
I understand your concern, I had the exact same thing. I've told her about all about it ever since I bought mine. She understands it's use as a currency, and, although she might not have total faith in it overthrowing the dollar, I believe that I've sufficiently made her aware of the potential risks. Regardless I still hope I'm (we're) right.
@_date: 2013-04-17 19:59:10
Awesome, now just to figure out how to buy Bitcoins without giving away informations like my SSN.
EDIT: Butcoins?
@_date: 2013-11-15 22:19:34
Could you expand a bit on your hobby? Do you consider altcoin to be better than litecoin, and if so, why? It's freezing cold where I am and I'd love a new space heater. Is my i7 3770K and GTX 660ti decent enough for any ROI whatsoever?
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:49:16
Yeah, she's hoping for a long term investment and, probably due to my preaching to her about the viability of BTC in common currency, hoping that she might someday be able to buy actual things with it. To the moon, right? Man, I really hope it's a positive outcome tomorrow. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:29:10
If only anywhere in Utah accepted Bitcoins on a small payment basis. Recently lost my Blockchain password which had my only one on it (can't tell ya how much that sucks), so all I've got is 10ish bucks in coin, hah. Does anyone know a place I can get a meal or something with that coin?
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:34:55
Cool, that'd be perfect! Guess I'll just wait for the "Sold Out" to turn to a "buy here"? 
@_date: 2013-04-18 20:54:40
That's a good idea. Not sure what specialized services I could offer considering I'm underaged and have no car. Also there are not a lot of people locally who will pay me Bitcoins in exchange for their lawn mowed, hah.
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:18:55
I know I'm late to the party, but if there are any left I'd love one?
@_date: 2013-06-21 05:43:51
I'm not sure if this is already a feature, but the ability to purchase bitcoin or put money into an exchange using the Facebook credit would cause me and I'm sure tons of others to flock to it.
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:32:46
I don't live in a big city, plus I'm 16 so it'd be kinda odd. Thanks for the suggestion though!
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:01:20
Wait.. What happened to $900?
@_date: 2013-07-04 04:40:35
Well that's certainly a creative idea. Although personally unless you were an extraordinary builder (there is no proof to that nor it's contrary), I'd not waste my money. So I recommend posting photos and videos of some things you've built in the past. Are you FyreUK level?
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:36:22
Yeah, I've tried that, sadly the closest is around 100 miles away and the prices are much higher than the market average.
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:42:26
Any idea if I could get a print to Utah before Christmas?
