Quick everyone trade your btc for doge!
Now sale all your dogecoin for anc when doge gets expensive
Now bottom dropped outta bitcoin
Now anc is popular and expensive sale all of them for cheap btc
Now btc is expensive again
If everyone does it we can redistribute the btc to the fastest buyers!
Redistribution of wealth 101!

If I pay you to not do any of those things, is it murder? Attempted murder? 
@_date: 2014-12-01 13:04:02
If you need the money, I'd sell what you need now, even if the price goes up a little bit It'd probably still be cheaper than interest on your credit card, and if you lucky the price to replace them could be a little bit less if it does drop 50$ again

Once upon a time there was 3 little piggies. The first lived in a house of straw, the second a house of sticks, and the third a house made out of big bad wolf pelts. You can guess which one the wolf didn't try to blow down. The end. 
@_date: 2014-11-15 04:29:28
It's a plot to keep people away from bitcoin obviously 
@_date: 2014-11-19 01:42:09
I just posted about this earlier today, they need to allow you to read qr from your gallery so you could save the qr/power+volume down screenshot, it would be handy for websites that dont have the mobile link to open your wallet
@_date: 2014-11-17 03:49:57
I'll trade you $1 in bitcoin for 50cents paypal need it for shipping a giveaway in @_date: 2014-11-18 21:37:04
But how do i take a pic of a qr code on my phone, while using my phone to access website with qr code!?
@_date: 2014-11-10 09:40:26
Might try it though 90% of the people around here seem to think the only thing on the Internet is ebay/craigslist/facebook... 
@_date: 2014-11-13 01:34:57
Wheres the best place to convert doge to Bitcoin? Is bter.com good? 
@_date: 2014-11-14 01:41:47
Your posts must be solid gold! 
@_date: 2014-11-13 19:13:20
I'm just getting started, checkout cex.io it seems like a great exchange for any cryptocurrency and you can buy Bitcoin on it using cc or even trade other coin for it(I don't have a bank account so I just bought dogecoin with PayPal then converted it to Bitcoin)
@_date: 2014-11-13 03:18:19
Scammers ruin it for all of us :(
@_date: 2014-11-10 11:00:20

@_date: 2014-11-03 01:37:37
Thank you! 
@_date: 2014-11-13 19:19:20
Bro it's science what comes up must come down! Just stick in there I'll hop again, and if we're lucky it'll hop enough to escape gravity and just float way above our expectations! Remember buy the dip! 
@_date: 2014-11-02 21:14:18
Id like to give it a try
@_date: 2014-11-30 09:05:54
Cool,  i love the Hitman games, been forever since I played it, sign me up

But then you would need enough energy to make the solar panels! It'll never work! 
@_date: 2014-11-16 06:52:00
@_date: 2014-12-01 12:48:10
What'd you pay for the coin? I  wouldn't  sale at a loss, though I don't think bitcoin is going to go lower than 300$ anymore 
@_date: 2014-11-15 21:34:43
Wait why not just buy bitcoin with your mturks account rather than reinventing the wheel? Secondly I agree Skynet is coming!
@_date: 2014-12-02 08:31:46
Done, subscribed
@_date: 2014-11-16 00:55:05
Bah humbug!
Fake Edit: you're
@_date: 2014-11-29 06:58:58
Confirmed! Errr sorry but when someone tells me not to do something, I have to do the opposite, unless I know why not
@_date: 2014-11-29 00:18:08
Hell yeah,  I'm going to remember this next time law wants to try to catch me at the drop-off spot for the money... Now if only I could send my hostie through the Internet so they can't get me when I release one
@_date: 2014-11-16 00:05:45

@_date: 2014-11-29 07:01:41
I like penny stocks and I love bitcoin, so I guess I check this out
@_date: 2014-11-18 21:56:42
Yeah Mycelium needs to add a get from gallery option
@_date: 2014-11-15 22:58:22
I'm really hoping they do, if bitcoin is added to wallet, I believe it won't be trying, it just simply will...it would turn the price of a btc way up and confirm btcs place in the world
@_date: 2014-11-13 22:33:15
Ok ok I got one! 
How many Republicans does it take to

So how do the Egyptian Pharaoh Bitcoins get to come back in their after life?
You import the paper wallet they were sent to.
@_date: 2015-03-26 17:26:46
Mine completed instantly,  but I had to open a ticket, took about 4hrs to get them to respond and manually send it… they lost  any future business from me,  I've used cex.io and bter a few times and never had a problem with them
@_date: 2015-03-20 07:53:15
Nice, first I've seen of that site got it bookmarked for next time
@_date: 2015-03-20 04:16:39
Oh wow, fixed! I do like this site, runs better on my phone than bter (and they need to renew their cert, that's why I figured I'd try cryptsy)
@_date: 2015-02-22 04:35:17
I think he was joking... Well at least I hope people don't call everyone who smokes a dirty hippy lol
