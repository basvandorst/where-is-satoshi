All of your questions can be answered in one sentence:
We are not disbursing MOOT to any traders unless they ask for it, chargebacks are a real headache and those who see the value will reach out to us, in short, no one is forcing you to use MOOT or MoonTrade, whether you are inclined or disinclined has zero effect on our community, also you are fixating on one thing while conveniently ignoring the fact that 
1. we believe in no-KYC, 
2. have no deposit requirements to list ads
3. Have no limits on trades
3. Are developing towards decentralizing the entire exchange . 
5. Have ZERO fees for trading.
So thanks for your concern trolling, hopefully no one falls for it. Good luck!
