Convince him to buy an equal-ish amount of gold and to put a bit in the bank, too. If Bitcoin goes big, it goes very big, but it might go small. Gold is very very unlikely to go small, it's been worth big for over three thousand years. Banks sometimes go small but they're a lot less likely to go small than Bitcoin. So it's good to have all three to kinda balance things out.
If you're in a big city you should be able to purchase a 1/20th troy ounce gold coin from your local jewellery store for around $50. They're shiny, I recommend it.

Linden Dollars were also the launching point for my first BTC purchase, but it was a few months after yours so I was on an exchange. I remember converting MYR to USD to Linden Dollars to BTC and finally sending it over to my wallet, losing 10% - 20% in transaction fees each time. It was quite a hassle but I was very glad to finally own a bit of Bitcoin.
Then China did China things and the price went from the ATH of $1000ish down to $200ish and I went "oh well" and kinda forgot about it until January of this year when it hit $1000 again.
If I had DCA'd my way through those missing years... I probably would've spent most or all of it on dates and videogames anyway. I don't see a likely scenario where I would've had the willpower to HODL to millionaire status.

Could you donate even a little bit ($10,000ish) to something fun? It does warm my heart every time I find out that rich people are giving money to good causes, but it's also happened so much that it's almost background noise at this point.
Then Bill Gates gives to something fun and exciting like those lasers cannons that target mosquitoes or that plan to release a bunch of sterile mosquitoes into the wild so that the stupid mosquito virgins waste their stupid mosquito sex on these stupid sterile mosquitoes and whole populations die out from lack of stupid mosquito babies.
Or I'll hear of someone who gave a couple thousand dollars to fund a project to dig a really big hole and then just fill it with cheap nontoxic shiny things and I'll be like "haha, yeah, that sounds like something I'd do if I had practically unlimited monies. Good on that guy. I wonder what else he's doing?" and then I'll find that he's chosen a bunch of actually helpful causes that of course resonate with me and so I end up either learning about important things in the world or even giving five bucks of my own to help out.
Anyway just a thought. Good on you for making the world a better place, dude. ��

Only maybe? What are the odds of a crash before we hit $5,000? We've already tripled in such a short amount of time; we'd just need to double what we are now and we're already way past there!

If you wanna go all-in with the tech, you'll need 150GB of free space to download the whole blockchain. This will take around a week. After that you can turn on pruning to bring the size down to 550MB, which is lovely but apparently not as good as having the 150GB so just bear that in mind.
While you're waiting for the 150GB to download, though, you can already receive bitcoins so you can actually download a client, generate a wallet and start buying immediately. I buy my coins from people on LocalBitcoins but in your country you're probably better off with an exchange; they're more regulated and trustworthy than random fellow countrymen on the internet.
Actually, the other day my brother turned me down when I advised him to make a wallet and offered to give him .01BTC; so if you sign up I'll send you his percent of a coin to get you started.
EDIT: Just noticed that I didn't actually answer your question. Yes, it's still worth investing in. I'm expecting it to reach over $100,000 a coin eventually, like when I have kids eventually, but it might crash to nothing before then. If it does do the bad thing then I'll lose what I would've spent on food in four or six months, so bad but not a huge deal. If it does the good thing I will super regret not buying more. I'd say put in maybe a tenth of your salary one month and just see what happens. Worse case, you lose an expensive dinner. Best case, maybe you can buy a neat yacht for your family in 20 years. Realistically (if you don't lose your wallet and forget your passphrase), you'll cash most of it out for the price of a motorcycle in 4 years or so when the price spikes again and you remember that you actually own a bit, but that'll still be pretty nice.
@_date: 2017-08-12 04:15:56
Haha, indeed it is.
If you wanna feel better about yourself, I just had an irresistible offer for sexytimes that meant just I had to sell more than half my stash to afford the upcoming date, so unless it crashes in the next five minutes I'm once again making a huge bitcoin mistake.
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:01:07
Hang on to them, if the price does the same thing it did in the last 5 years then in late 2022 then your two coins will be worth a cool mil and a half.
If you want my honest opinion, you've done great for yourself. You've got two coins and there'll only ever be 21 million of 'em. Either bitcoin crashes to nothing and you've lost a motorcycle or an expensive holiday's worth of money, or else Bitcoin goes to the moon and you've made yourself a millionaire.
The only way the price never breaches $3900 again is if Bitcoin fails completely and if that happens you probably have a lot more to worry about than the loss of two coins.

How many joke comments like these would have to be made before someone eventually gets the day right, though? That'll be a spooky day when it arrives.
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:15:09
Haha, I think I have the exact same story as you. Sold a few weeks ago at the $3300 ATH thinking I was being smart and selling right before a crash. The crash eventually happened, of course... From $4500 to $3800.
I'm buying back in as soon as payday rolls around. Back to a tidy .2 on the 25th and adding a bit more every month until it crashes to $0 or goes to the moon.
See you in five years, my friend.
@_date: 2017-08-12 09:37:43
It, uh... it was not a large stash.
Also I skimped on miner's fees (100 Satoshis instead of the recommended 200) and the transaction has been sitting in limbo for 7 hours so the date might not even be able to happen.
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:43:18
Haha, are you me? I bought in in December 2013 at 1000ish, saw the drop, thought "well this is bad but at least it'll be cheap when I buy in again", bought in again in January 2014 at 800ish, saw it drop again all the way to 200 and stopped paying attention until earlier this year when it was making headlines again and I bought more at 2400.
@_date: 2017-08-12 02:48:28
Thanks, reading it now.
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:39:47
Exactly. If dangerouslytimid wants to buy some bitcoin, he should start with no more than an expensive dinner's worth; something he won't mind losing in the short term but still enough to be a nice surprise in a few years time.
The money for the child should go in the Junior ISA, especially since the relative gave it with the intention that that was where it would go. Maybe if it was just a general gift or windfall you could go 50% BTC and 50% traditional investments, but it seems like it would be very rude and very foolish to spend it on something so volatile when it was already supposed to go elsewhere.

My workmate is doing it on her laptop; she started on Wednesday and she's halfway done. The first few years of the blockchain should fly by, after that it's slow going. You just need the 150GB and you just need it once; since you're on a laptop I'd recommend pruning to get you down to just 550MB of used space.
You don't have to wait one week. The moment you download a client (I use Bitcoin Core AKA Bitcoin-qt) and generate your wallet, you'll be able to access a receiving address. Reply with that (or PM it to me if you don't wanna risk someone else finding the address and dropping in more donations for lulz) and I can send you your little bit of Bitcoin immediately.
With your wallet, security is important, but so is ensuring that the coins make it to future-you safe. You have a .DAT file to secure, and you have a passphrase to secure. As far as I know, nobody can access your coins without both.
Ensure your passphrase is something you've never used before and something you'll never forget. You can write down a reminder on paper that'll only be useful to yourself and keep it in your wallet. FGsltwtHgHobStwbiHsnpbshelJ316 would be a pretty decent passphrase if it wasn't so obvious, but it should give you an idea of where to start. Never use your passphrase anywhere else, never write it down, only share the reminder with people you'd take a bullet for and who would do that same for you.
Your .DAT file is the wallet itself. If someone gets a hold of this they could spend forever trying to brute force the passphrase, and they probably will if you have more than a tenth of a coin in there. Without the passphrase they can't do anything to your balance, but they can view incoming and outgoing transactions. I'm not sure how to secure the .DAT file while guaranteeing that future-you will have access to it. I'm sure someone else on this subreddit has figured it out; meanwhile I've just stored mine digitally behind one of my oldest passwords and I'm thinking of creating an offline copy on a USB that I'll keep in my wallet or something.
When buying your first few bits of Bitcoin (which you can do immediately; you won't be able to spend them until a week from now when your blockchain's all downloaded but you can acquire them in literally the next 2 minutes if you can download and install the client fast enough); I'd recommend starting at the smallest possible amount. Get used to the process, and then when you've confirmed receipt you can buy the "for-real" amount of whatever it is an expensive dinner costs where you live.
Once your wallet has an actual balance and you can watch the charts to see yourself get dozens of dollars richer in real time, the temptation will be there to wait for a crash before buying your "for-real-for-real" investment of half your next salary or something. Do not wait for the crash. Yes, almost everyone here agrees it will happen, but the thing is it could happen a month from now and crash to its price from 2 weeks from now. You'll still be buying in for less than if you bought today. Buy as soon as possible AND buy during the crash.
Never buy more than you can lose. Every day Bitcoin exists is a day I get further from the belief that could ever be worth nothing, but I'm never going to let that belief drop below 1% in my head. After your Bitcoin exceeds "fun" amounts (0.1 btc; I'd say), you're gonna wanna make sure you are matching its amount in a bank or gold or silver or something else that traditionally is a good hold of value. That way if shit does go down with Bitcoin, you'll still have something to fall back on.
Finally, and this bit is optional, if your wallet ever does grow beyond "fun" amounts, then I recommend spreading the love and offering to give some "resentment insurance" to those closest to you. I offered .01btc for my best friend and siblings. This'll also mean that they'll have to get their own wallets set up, and they'll have to learn a bit about bitcoin, and they'll have the thrill of watching it rise (and fall), which may lead to another adopter of the coin which is good for all of us; primarily because the more coins they buy, the more the coins we hold will be worth, but also because we all benefit from increasing usage and so on. Also, as the name "resentment insurance" implies, if the price ever does go to the moon then at least they'd be there with you instead of stuck on earth, perhaps asking for handouts upset that you didn't "tell them sooner". Would suck to have a five-year friendship end that way.
TL;DR Good luck, HODL HODL HODL, and let me know your receiving address!

Transaction went through after eight(!!!) hours, so I was able to have a great date; definitely top 3 of the 20 or so I've had in the past year. We talked about Bitcoin while cuddling afterwards and she said she'll look into it when she gets back to Scotland, so that's pretty rad.
Anyway, I'm taking a day of annual leave on a Wednesday later this month to get my degree and visit the bank and do other stuff that would be tough to do during normal work hours. I'm gonna apply for a loan and see if I can get enough for a full bitcoin. I know that I shouldn't spend more than I can afford to lose, but I'm pretty sure I can afford to lose twelve months of payments... Just gonna have to cut back on the dates a bit and rekindle the relationship with right hand; I suppose.

I'm very tired; I would usually say a lot more but I just want to be done with Reddit for today so I can rest up before this work binge I've got to do (working from home, haha, it's got some pretty significant downs but the ups are very great so we deal) but I did feel the need to come in and say congratulations because it is a real achievement and I believe in "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you" and if (when? haha, nah, it's gotta be an if. I don't yet and won't for a while have the self-discipline for this to be a "when".) I ever had a whole Bitcoin I would appreciate someone congratulating me, too.
Hopefully it is secured offline with a copy of the full up-to-date blockchain and you have the password memorized and written (or have a strong hint written) somewhere safe and there's a decent .dat backup floating around in your secure storage somewhere and all that. Actually even if it doesn't meet all that it's probably fine; I only pretend to know a lot about Bitcoin; you almost definitely have this more figured out than me so it'd be more than a bit silly to have you taking my advice rather than vice versa.

I found my old wallet with a tenth of a bitcoin on it. Initially I was thinking of selling half, but after reading around on this subreddit for a bit that seems foolish so now I'm thinking I'll add a bit to it each month until I have a whole coin and then wait until 2027 or something to see what happens.
My Bitcoin Core says it still has 3 years and 10 weeks of transactions to catch up on... Does anyone know how long that will take? Also, how much space will I need on my PC to store all that information? Will I need 10x that amount if I'm going to carry this through to 2027? It seems a bit inconvenient.
@_date: 2017-05-22 13:05:55
Only a full day, eh? I was expecting to leave it on for a week.
100GB is a bit much, though... I only have 114GB free.
Anyway, it's now at 3 years and 2 weeks, so it's done 8 weeks in the hour since I posted. 158 weeks to go, 8 weeks an hour... That seems like 50 hours at this rate. Dang.
@_date: 2017-05-22 13:23:35
Wow, okay. I guess this is on hold for now, then.
I guess I'll get an online wallet and put my coins there for now. By the time I have the other .900 or so I should have figured out how to send stuff across without downloading the whole thing.

I bought a wee bit of Bitcoin at 1k per coin in 2013 just a day or so before it started crashing down to $200. Bought a bit more in January, then kinda forgot about it until I was dicking around on my work computer and saw that checking the bitcoin price was something Cortana could do. Saw it was at 2k and rising fast and decided to get back in.
I had to wait around four days for the node to catch up on the three years of transaction data I'd missed out on, and I needed to set aside 150GB of space on my computer to hold all that information. After that I was able to buy another one-tenth of a coin, most at Virwox until I saw that I'd lost 30% of the value because of fees, and the rest at LocalBitcoins. And then, just like in 2013, then price started dropping again. Oh well.
Anyway my point is you should be good holding and forgetting, just make sure you have the space set aside on your PC when it comes time to update, and remember that it'll take a week or so for the transactions to catch up before you can do anything.
I'm two-for-two at buying at all-time-highs right before big downward swings. Next time maybe I'll just wait a couple of days before buying in.
@_date: 2017-05-22 13:06:38
Really? Is there any downside? I'd be glad to just have the information from the past month or whatever on my computer, it would save so much space. At this rate it looks like I'll need at least a Terabyte if I want to hold to '27.
