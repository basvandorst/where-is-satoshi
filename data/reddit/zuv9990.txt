I don't think I understand your question then. It still sounds like what you're asking falls under the above scenario. The taxes are just nearly 0 since the price would realistically change by a few dollars over the course of several minutes. 
Sorry if that isn't helpful.

I've got something like 40 transactions that I did a terrible job tracking.  made the whole ordeal stupid simple. Even if it ends up not being perfect, it's plenty to take to a tax guy in the coming weeks to show all of my transactions.

I'm still new to figuring out the capital gains taxation, so anyone correct me if I'm wrong. If my understanding of it is correct, you don't need to convert to fiat for it to be seen as a gain. When masterzman says "'realize' the cash value", he/she is referring to the value of your bitcoin at the time of purchasing that altcoin. I believe this is then seen as your new "initial investment" if you want to think of it that way. 
For example, if you buy $100 of bitcoin at $100 a coin, you have 1 bitcoin. It triples up to $300, so your 1 bitcoin is now worth $300. You send that 1 bitcoin to another exchange and buy coin XYZ that is $10 coin, getting 30 coins. At the time of purchase, your bitcoin was worth $300. So you'd pay your capital  gains from $100 to $300, and your 30 coins in XYZ are your new "initial investment" when it comes to determining gains. So if XYZ goes up to $20, you pay capital gains on XYZ gains from $10 to $20 a coin. 
Again, still new to this, but that's my understanding of it. 
Edit: You pay your gains on XYZ when you cash it out or convert it to something else I mean. If you convert it back to bitcoin and cash out from bitcoin, you pay capital gains on XYZ as you sell it, and then you pay capital gains from bitcoin to fiat. Bitcoin to fiat in this case though, if you do it immediately, would realize no gains. If you let it sit until it goes up in value, you'd pay gains from whatever you cashed XYZ out to up to your new value of bitcoin.
