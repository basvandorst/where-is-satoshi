So tell me the deflationary impact of $100 invested in the stock market one hundred years ago is valued.

Sure, but two points:  
1.  In order to make the libertarian fantasy of zero regulation work, we need regulated utilities to power your electricity, your internet, your cell service, your roads, your drinking water, your legal systems, etc.
2.  Sure, the risk of Vanguard shutting down is real. There's also the risk of someone stealing bitcoin, losing access, etc.  When I have a fraud problem now, I call my bank, it's taken care of.

It's estimated more than a million bitcoin have been lost.  Also, what about Mt. Gox and all the other fraud / hacking 
 / thievery?

This is the REAL issue.  The Pound is a tool for transactions, NOT a store of wealth.  If you want to convert Pounds into wealth storage, you have real estate, stocks, art, intellectual property (like songs or art), etc. Gradual inflation is actually HEALTHY for economic systems because it incentivizes people to invest their money.  The idea that the tool for transactions should fluctuate violently as a store of wealth is pretty weird.

Right, but there's a workaround, it's called investing.

The purpose of a currency is to facilitate transactions, NOT to store wealth.  If you want to store wealth, hold valuable assets.  Convert your currency into stock or real estate when you're NOT using it, then when you need to buy something, convert it to currency.

I guess my point is compare the last 100 years if you held your money in cash or in DJI.
