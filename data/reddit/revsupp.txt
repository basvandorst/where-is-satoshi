Please enlighten me.

[We]( don't (so far) but we're probably not big enough for PP to worry about.

why link an 8-month-old article?

Totally agree with "theOriginalGman" and have been using coinpayments.net on my [site]( for awhile now. If you're only interested in Bitcoin and not other cryptocurrencies you might want to also look at bitpay.com or coinbase.com which only handle Bitcoin but make transferring to your bank (with a fee of course) pretty easy. Good luck!
If you get stuck feel free to [contact]( me as I've been doing this awhile.

As a merchant myself I have a [store]( and we accept Bitcoin along with over 40 other cryptocurrencies with the help of 3rd party payment processors. We want to concentrate on running a business and not worry about transaction confirmations, double spending, price fluctuations, selling high, converting to fiat, transferring to our bank account, etc. Like every other merchant we can't pay our bills, suppliers, tax, etc. with Bitcoin (yet) so need to have our cash flow in fiat currency. That's the reality right now even though we do keep ~20% in Bitcoin. A non-Bitcoin-expert is not going to want to accept Bitcoin and then simply keep Bitcoin. How could they? That doesn't make any business sense unless they wanted to speculate on their liquidity which would be a one-way street to bankruptcy. However, once enough service providers and suppliers jump on the Bitcoin train the game will most certainly change and what you've suggested will be possible. 
I do agree though a Bitcoin QR code plugin/extension provided at checkout, without the need for 3rd party processors, is needed for as many shopping carts and hosted sites as possible. I'm working on an OpenCart plugin right now for our [site](

Pretty much. If you have a decent amount you might wanna checkout: Good luck!

If by fiat you mean not fiat then yes!

Yes and yes. As a merchant [ourselves]( we'd love to keep our operating cash flow in Bitcoins for many reasons but considering our suppliers, bank, payment processors, hosting provider, shipping provider, state govt, fed govt, etc. don't accept Bitcoins it's unrealistic for us not to cash out. However, we do keep 20% in Bitcoin and are trying to find Bitcoin-friendly services to switch to and spread the word to our customers which in turn will encourage our suppliers to accept Bitcoin as well. It's a slow and frustrating process as most businesses live far from the cutting edge but with patience and constant reminders of the benefits of Bitcoin things will grow exponentially.

Yeah unfortunately $3 is charged to us by our suppliers for any order under $20. However, [contact us]( with the product(s) you were thinking of purchasing along with your zipcode and we'll "try" and waive the low order fee.

Paying tax is voluntary. Don't worry about it.

Switch to Android (sorry couldn't resist)
@_date: 2014-03-26 08:16:42
Most likely but have you checked out ?
@_date: 2014-03-26 08:28:39
Why run newer and older LTS versions? As I think "catwelder" was suggesting maybe booting from a liveUSB is a better/safer suggestion. Of course there's also the maintenance of wallet backups. Good luck!

That's great and I wish you all the best of luck. However, I assume you're cashing out into fiat so aren't you just replacing one payment processor (PayPal) for another (Bitpay) which means the same risk of having your account terminated?
I have a [store]( myself and know it's an uphill battle in trying to convince our suppliers to accept cryptocurrency but we try to keep at least 25% of our cash flow in crypto (Bitcoin &amp; Litecoin) but the reality is our bills, suppliers, govt, etc. need to be paid in cash. We're trying though and need to be patient and persistent.
I see you're accepting other cryptocurrencies but via contact/email? Have you considered coinpayments.net?
Without sounding hypocritical we too accept payments through:
- PayPal
- Bitpay
- Coinpayments
but eventually want to have payments processed on our site without a 3rd party and this is something I'm working on right now. In the meantime a distributed decentralised enchange/payment processor would be ideal. Let's see.
Best of luck.

Thanks. I'm happy Bitcoin isn't fiat then.

Paying tax is voluntary so don't worry about it.
