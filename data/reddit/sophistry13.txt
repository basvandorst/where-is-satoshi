Is this not normal then? I bought £10 of BTC on coinbase/gdax the other day to learn more about it all.

Is the price usually this jumpy? Only have 0.0007BTC to learn about it more but must be agony for people with large sums invested.

Yeh, I only have some to learn about it. You don't aim for a quick buck with less than $10 worth. Interesting so far.

Yes I understand now. Thanks. So you due to the encryption you can't lend it for someone else to use. It's just yours on your own device. Like putting money in a bank they take it and use it to invest, but a wallet can't do that because they can't get access to the bitcoins to use as they please.

There are rumours that oligarchs are using it to skirt around financial sanctions and letting them launder money in the West.

Yeh. At the moment they do things through multiple layers of shell companies with anonymous owners. Things like buying a property for well over the market value anonymously and having the seller pay back that money through more shell companies to clean it.

Recently got into learning about crypo and wondered why are there no banks or wallets that pay interest on the deposits? Is it because it'd be too big of a target to hack and steal? Or because crypto is too liquid that not enough people hold it in wallets for a significant amount of time for a bank to use to invest in?

It delegitimises it and might force other countries to increase legislation to regulate it to stop them laundering money to bypass sanctions.

I appreciate it. I guess it's sort of like having a fiat currency note isn't you storing it. It is just a promise by the central bank of access to the set amount of gold in their stores etc.

Ah ok thanks. So it's too all over the place for someone to make a company that acts as a wallet but uses that coin for investments and pays interest to people to encourage them to keep their coin in their wallet rather than an external one. 
Suppose bitcoin banks took off and tied the value of crypto to the real world stock exchange investments they made, would that not help stabilise it?
