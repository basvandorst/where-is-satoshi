The craziest thing I still don't understand are the businesses that still use debit card transactions without the pin number. Like for example I know McDonald's still just lets you swipe a card with no knowledge of the pin number "security" method. And even so... its easy to see someone type a 4 digit number and remember or guess it.

None, yet.

You guys must have NFC chips in your cards right? I thought that was the coolest thing ever, especially when google wallet and NFC enabled phones came out. I amazed some mcdonalds worker who asked me to pay, and I shook my phone over the card swipe to do so. I think she nearly broke from confusion at my "voodoo magic"

I have no idea if there's a limit. I've never spent that much there in the first place to find that out.

[Something like this?](  
Edit: Holy shit according to that with .25% of the world economy and 66% of them used for transactions makes bitcoins worth over $14k. I need to invest more :(

I don't think so, at least not for everything. Check [my comment]( for why. At larger numbers the amount of microbitcoin becomes a little bit ridiculous.

Let's hope not.

Speaking of grocery stores I would love to see more of them accept bitcoin. I see more and more of them where I live starting to accept paypal. So I hope that's not too far off.

[Just the beginning is bad enough](  
Edit: "It takes the power away from the government, and gives it to the people", "And that's a good thing?"  
I'm confused here as I'm pretty sure Republicans want this.
[Here's another one](
"Bitcoin not backed by anything other than that merchants accept it"
So is USD...

Let's have some fun with conversions. And I'll be using the estimate of a BTC value that we had today $315 = 1 BTC  
($.00000315) .00000001 BTC = 1 Satoshi  
($.0000315) .0000001 BTC = 1 DekaSatoshi  
($.000315) .000001 BTC = 1 HectoSatoshi  
($.00315) .00001 BTC = 1 KiloSatoshi  
($3.15) .01 BTC = 1 MegaSatoshi  
($3,150) 10 BTC = 1 GigaSatoshi  
($3,150,000) 10,000 BTC = 1 TeraSatoshi  
($31.5) 0.1 BTC = 1 DeciBitcoin  
($3.15) .01 BTC = 1 CentiBitcoin  
($.315) .001 BTC = 1 MilliBitcoin  
($.000315) .000001 BTC = 1 MicroBitcoin  
($3.15) 1 CentiBitcoin = 1 MegaSatoshi  
($.000315) 1 MicroBitcoin = 1 HectoSatoshi  
($.0000315) 1 DekaSatoshi = 10 Satoshi  
($.000315) 1 HectoSatoshi = 100 Satoshi  
($.00315) 1 KiloSatoshi = 1000 Satoshi  
($3.15) 1 MegaSatoshi = 1,000,000 Satoshi  
($3,150) 1 GigaSatoshi = 1,000,000,000 Satoshis  
($3,150,000) 1 TeraSatoshi = 1,000,000,000,000 Satoshis  
($315) 1 BTC = 100,000,000 Satoshis  
($315) 1 BTC = 10,000,000 DekaSatoshi  
($315) 1 BTC = 1,000,000 HectoSatoshi  
($315) 1 BTC = 100,000 KiloSatoshis  
($315) 1 BTC = 100 MegatSatoshi  
($315) 1 BTC = .1 GigaSatoshis  
  
  
($.315) .001 BTC = 1000 microBitcoin  
($315) 1 BTC= 1,000,000 microBitcoin  
(.00000315) 1 Satoshi = .01 Microbitcoin  
  
  
Now for some random conversions and facts:  
 
Most people tip $.25, $.50, and $1  
  
In our conversion tables these can be:  
$.25  
This is equal to .00079365 BTC or  
79.36507937 Kilosatoshis or   
793.65 microBitcoin  
 
$.50  
.001587301 BTC or  
158.7301587 Kilosatoshis or  
1,587.3 microBitcoins or  
$1  
.0031746 BTC or  
317.4603174 Kilosatoshi or  
3,174.6 Microbitcoins  
How about a Big Mac Value meal?  
[Price: $6.64 take from here](  
.0210793765 BTC or  
2,107.936508 Kilosatoshis or  
21,079.365 Microbitcoins  
Well let's step it up a bit to something more expensive. How about a nice $2,000 gaming rig?  
6.349206349 BTC or  
634,920.63 Kilosatoshis or  
6,349,206.349 microbitcoins  
How about a new car valued at around $15,000 USD?  
47.61904762 BTC or  
4,761,904.762 Kilosatoshi or  
47,619,046.2 Microbitcoins  
And my yearly salary of $35,000 USD?  
111.1111111 BTC (Wtf I know right?)/year  
9.259259258/BTC month  
2.314814815/BTC week or  
11,111,111.11 Kilosatoshis or  
111,111,111.111 microbitcoins  
Let's buy a house! $215,392 USD (random number but close to average)  
683.784127 BTC or  
68,378,412.7 KiloSatoshis or  
683,784,127 microbitcoins  
Overall I think we are going to have to learn many different denominations because some of those values are going to be awkward to look at if bitcoin ever takes off like we want it to. Imagine going to buy a house and they throw out a huge number of 683.78M microbitcoins.... Large numbers can catch people by surprise. I think as we move into higher priced objects we can gravitate toward a higher denomination like BTC (base) for the house. Idk though, that's just my 63.49206349 microbitcoins.
