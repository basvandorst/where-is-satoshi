Cryptocurrencies are fascinating! 
I recommend doing research of the current monetary system i.e the federal reserves creation in 1913.. (and the 9x inflation they have to every $)
Doing research on the current Crypto-currency climate (which Bitcoin is in a precarious position) 
After this maybe enlighten them to the scenario you see?

Bitcoin will forever be tainted by the drugs and gambling trades.. as thats where it really kicked off for Bitcoin.
I think your parents need to get past the shallowness of these two markets and understand Bitcoin is the start of a digital and monetary revolution.. where the governments can't hyper inflate our $/£ to infinity and we choose which cryptocurrency we want to use.. rather than state served debt money. 
Do they know that fiat is only a promise of debt?

@_date: 2016-04-26 14:05:14
I disagree. If we can get the view of many, an all seeing eye is much easier to gather.
 Personally I see that 3000 CNY has been challenged several times in the last 6 months and failed. I'm hesitant to see if it actually can break 3100 this time round. Has everyone forgotten about the imminent rise of transaction times in the backlogs already?! .

not when ALL the exchanges follow Okcoin and Huobi, its certainly relevant. 
@_date: 2015-12-21 19:58:53
I am right.
Bitcoin peaked on 12/7/2015 @ $304 in the same week (or the one before) that Bitcoins transactions peaked @ 194,000 on 6/7/2015. (bearing in mind the max transactions is 200,000 per day)
Bitcoin fell down to the low of to $214 on the 25/8/2015 and has grown to where it is now.
YOU ARE LYING!!!!!

Yes I know what the post is about, the link is there. 
It is when the network hits 200,000 transactions per day (or 7 transactions per second i think) that the network hits problems.
the time (of 80,000?! unconfirmed transactions) you are referring to was when the network hit 196,000 transactions per day... right now if you LOOK at the transactions chart you will realise there is a MUCH (216,000 transactions per day) bigger problem on Bitcoins hands.

good point, the monetary system isn't ideal but whats the point of taking one step forward with bitcoin if we take 2 steps back by not addressing the issues appropriately.
Saying that scaling Bitcoin was promising and I look forward to see what the score is in January. If all goes well. Mega mun $2 K BTC pre-halving

localbitcoins premiums fall to less than 1% when Bitcoin is crashing...
@_date: 2015-12-26 16:44:18
the danger makes the coins all the more profitable. 
@_date: 2015-12-21 19:45:16
and if i remember correctly Bitcoin stagnated at around $300 and fell down. Hardfork is more than welcome! 
@_date: 2015-12-26 16:43:27

The ONLY reasons for this slide is the change in programming from the 13/1/2016. This is EXPECTED.
@_date: 2015-12-26 17:23:04
For me its just logic. 
We all know changes are to be implemented in Bitcoin in January and by that rationing people will get scared and sell out until they know what is going to happen. 
However seen as you asked for a link i'll have a look around and see if i can find like-minded posts. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 02:01:21

@_date: 2015-12-15 16:44:21
there are alot of reasons to suggest Huobi and Okcoin's volume are fake.
 there are only 14,000,000 BTC. I thought China came late to the party and now what? We are expected to think they are the party?! no chance. 
@_date: 2015-12-15 16:33:13

All I'm saying is, the No fees trading in China warped our minds for years on end to think the CNY rate was the Be-all-and-end-all. 
However looking at [Coin-Dance]( paints a different story. Its not about 8888 CNY or $1155 anymore. Its about the bigger picture coming together.

As a long term user of BTCE, I'm not sure how well I can answer your question. I was lucky enough not to loose anything by just a few days in that one. 
Recently however, I've dabbled in Bitfinex again. They're a little buggy. But, if your in and out Finex is a good experience right now (atleast for me) 
Haven't used Bittrex (but I hear good things about them) 
disclaimer - have developed anxiety disorder. 
I would only use Poloniex if you never want to see your money again. (with that being said I've never had a problem withdrawing or depositing into Polo as recently as 6 weeks ago)

Lets not play dumb, this post hasn't been removed for a reason.

I know a guy who spent 25 BTC on Silk road and never even got it.

I'll answer it for you. You'd be crying in a corner for 3 days wondering why you didn't pay the $1/TX fee. 
Eventually the fees would get so high,  hope would decimate. You'd Flip your shit and get back to your life like crypto never happened. 
@_date: 2015-09-04 13:01:57
no because it looks bad on XT and good on BTC
@_date: 2015-11-25 04:04:58
They also gave obituary for Litecoin. 
 
Is it not immoral of them to write of the 2nd biggest decentralised currency as 'ded' when its out performing every coin bar Bitcoin?!
@_date: 2015-11-24 02:29:24
shall we make one? :P

Bitcoin had 80,000 in the $310 peak of July 2015, subsequently in the August the price crashed to $250-200.  
@_date: 2015-11-26 17:24:34
it is the act of mining the coins (through algorithms which if the miner guesses correctly will be rewarded with a block of 25 Bitcoin).. that gives Bitcoin a legal tender of currency as is costs money through hardware and electricity to gain the coins. 
@_date: 2016-10-27 12:09:44
You didn't answer my question
@_date: 2015-11-07 01:10:27
It is through prohibition that those "authorities" realise they can do nothing to stop it. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 15:36:27
And if EVERYONE where to pay that premium fee as you. How would you feel with your pending transaction? 
@_date: 2015-11-15 03:43:36
i would if i could 
@_date: 2015-11-25 04:06:50
@_date: 2016-10-26 16:10:43
When will people learn that willful ignorance of the unconfirmed transactions is FUD in itself!
I know Segwit is around the corner, but this is the here and now!

less than 1% of Gox's funds were hacked 
@_date: 2015-11-27 15:23:22
localbitcoins.com is easy to buy off of. If you have a low score count they'll require I.D but once the money has been sent to them i've never waited more than 20-25 minutes for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 00:17:20
so many scams 
@_date: 2015-11-25 02:22:02
this is the end Gox 2.0
@_date: 2015-11-08 20:05:55
From the low's of the year to the height, i would have to disagree with your statement.
litecoin started 2015 @ $1.05 and peaked at just under $9 = a 850%+ increase. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 06:51:13
However much you try and contrast this post, it doesn't take away the fact there are 47015 unconfirmed transactions @ this time of writing. 
@_date: 2015-11-26 19:12:23
ok then its legal tender by "commodity".

localbitcoins 99% of the time will require ID if you have a low score count.

The technology in theory would need to develop in order to avoid the issue of finite addresses available or recycle the wasted addresses.

Unfortunately we don't take Crypto. I can see the HQ changing their minds though. Incoming Banking collapse n all.

@_date: 2016-10-13 16:52:24
because a stock market crash would bring fear and uncertainty to the worlds fiat/stock exchange and most other commodities.. I'm not saying Crypto is invincible but a deflationary system is the ideal way right now.
How exactly is your condescending question adding any good to this? Can you not see my point, or did you have to be told? 
@_date: 2015-11-27 15:02:03
i am so JELOUS

@_date: 2017-07-26 10:18:00
I'm doubting BTCE right now. 24 hours downtime? 15 hours since last tweet? 
It's almost like the BTCE crew are getting theimselves heated-up enough to tell us what really happened 
@_date: 2015-10-20 23:33:08
Divide that number by 7 billion (hypothetically taking into account for every human alive making BTC addresses), the number of years would sharply decline.
@_date: 2015-11-15 00:46:08
 buy low.
sell high.
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:18:25
I highly doubt it. I remember this one time in January 2016 they were down for over 12 hours! I was shitting myself then. 
My ma even consoled me whilst I wept into a spliff lol 
@_date: 2016-05-01 10:10:58

I traded 5 Bitcoin to Litecoin in April and just that trade is now worth 11-12 bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-10-09 12:50:30

I've only ever used it on Localbitcoins to trade it to Litecoin.

We will just have to agree to disagree. 
The status quo of how Bitcoin works guarantee's that bitcoin is "a legal tender of currency." 
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:46:09
I had a shit ton of coin there not 2 months ago D: 
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:10:03


Do we need to FUD anymore? The jury is out. I might have a little tear for BTCE today. They were good people. (FYI I found their support to be better than most exchanges) 
RIP / You will be missed. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 12:15:18
And arguably its FUD that its Coinbases.. not even Charlie Lee could confirm it was CB's. Fact is 24 Hours + with the website down and so much information gushing around leads me to believe something serious has happened 
@_date: 2015-11-26 17:51:41
I have my savings 100% in Litecoin. = $1k+ within 24 hours.

Ye, looks like we might get a bear market for a bit... Shame my favourite exchange is down :( 
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:42:00

I only ever read from 2nd hand sources, I don't know sorry. A little digging will find you the source I'm sure 
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:20:21
I don't think I'll be comfortable moving any coins onto any exchanges for the coming year now. I trusted BTCE the most. 
 
I member the CNY along with the GBP, shame they took them off due to low volume... and not* to forget FeatherCoin! 
@_date: 2017-07-26 11:23:49
For fucks sake. AlphaBay, Hansa.. and now BTCE. 
I mean I was aware the CEO was in the Panama papers.. but cmon we want to trade Coins and stay ***anonymous***.. not have some pig party GDAX
@_date: 2017-07-26 12:04:15
in my 4 years of trading I've never seen that status page. 
This time is different.. thats for sure. 
Given the longitude I left my coins there sometimes.. I feel downright lucky right now

I took all my money out 60 days ago, although i had extended periods of trading where I would leave my coin in there for months at a time. Fucking stupid, but making money so meh
