There you go.  I agree.

I agree with that.  They are terrorist organizations and it's best not to come at them directly for the long term win.

I may give you some bitcoins for your house.  It's still easier in dollars.

Looks like a nice program that generates bitcoin addresses, only displays the address and public key and then let's you retrieve the private key when you give it one of the public keys it previously generated.
It would be a lot quicker if it it just printed the address, public key and private key all at once.

So governments are terrorist organizations.

It's not ready to be a unit of account yet.  It won't be until it approaches it's true value.  The market is trying to determine it's true value.
I can tell you it's way above where it is now.

I have to go sorry.  I do agree with you.  But here's how I agree.  Governments are terrorist organizations on the whole.  It's not always best to come at them directly.  That's why I agree with you.

So we need regulation in order for the government to not attack bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-01-29 02:09:01
Uhh...looks like we're WELL into return to mean which is a rise.  Damn, they can't read their own chart.
@_date: 2014-01-29 03:50:47
Why not?  Let's do a thought experiment.
@_date: 2014-01-29 03:49:52
Ok...explain it to us.  Why do we need government regulation to install ATMs?
@_date: 2014-01-28 23:40:08
Just a group of government officials being strong armed into attempting to slow the adoption of bitcoin by bankers that control our judicial system.

So you're saying we need government regulation so we can have less government regulation?
Or are you saying it's flown under the radar of terrorists governments that would try to kill it to benefit themselves?
