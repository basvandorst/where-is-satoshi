The hardware wallet does not have a set key/word list, it is generated when you set it up. I just purchased a Ledger Nano S a few weeks ago so I can speak to that one. When you firsts plug it in it asks you if you are creating a new wallet or recovering from a word list. When you pick new wallet it has you set a PIN on the device. Once the PIN is set it generates a key and shows you the 24 words. 
That being said I still chose not to buy from a random seller on Amazon.  I looked at Ledger's list of authorized sellers and purchased directly from one of them. 
Even then I consider the initial word list to be my trial key. I added ~$10 of Litecoin, wiped the device, restored the key with the word list and made sure my LTC was still safe. Next I repeated these actions with an added passphrase. Once I was sure about the recovery process I move my LTC off and wiped the device again. I made sure any and all camera's in the room were covered, picked create new wallet, created my PIN and wrote down the recovery words on the supplied recovery card. The card quickly went in to a sealed container and is hidden away in a separate geographic location in hopes I never need it again.

We picked the rPi for the initial design because I had one that was bored and it is a convenient self contained solution.  We do want to make an Arduino version since can run off a USB port. I don't think I can port the calls to the HTTPS hosted API so I am planning on running the grunt work on the PC. Plus it  eliminates having to mess with  the network connection on the pi.

Yes I wrote the code and we do plan on posting it. I am redesigning the way I control the servo as the current way is jittery and inconsistent.  Give me a day or two to finish up the changes.

It is pulling the price from  They have a nice API set where you can pull any combo of crypto/fiat you want. You can even specify which exchange to pull price from.
