You can back up the code of each 2FA when you create the account. For example store the barcode. Or you can back up the authenticator app from your phone. I use titanium backup.

I have been waiting for more than 24 hours now. Seems like they are very annoyed with cryptsy over at the r/dogecoin

Got an immediate reply from them:
"To prevent unauthorized withdraws, all accounts that activate a password reset will be frozen for a period of 24 hours.
Your account will be unlocked on XXX and your withdrawal will go thru at that time."
Well I did not require a passwort reset, I changed it after i succesfully logged in. But I can live with that.

For me it works like this: I scan a code with my android phone during setup. When I want to login to gmail it asks me for a code. The phone gives shows me a code for that account. I can check off If I want to permanently validate the machine I am loggin in with. So you have to do the 2 FA every time you log in with a new machine. Some services demand a code for every login.
