more data points blends outliers into a more reliable mean. low number of data points means odd outliers can affect the reliability of derivative calculations

I recall reading earlier in the series that there are more 750KB blocks than the ones after, so may just be less supporting data for the higher buckets

Where does the bitcoin come from to fund that? You'd probably have to take it from miners.

If banks report transactions over $10K, how does the IRS even know about a string of deposits under $10K to build suspicion in the first place?
Seems like the $10K figure is just there to placate the masses and the government knows every single thing we do through a bank. 
Am I missing something here?
@_date: 2014-01-17 00:09:15
Is this real? Comments on the article says it's an obvious fake.

He brushes over that remarkably casually but it's actually a pretty advanced/interesting concept that I've never even considered and potentially valuable tool to the needs of bitcoin markets.
@_date: 2014-01-03 16:46:15
Ha, it's not some nefarious practice. If liquidity on exchanges isn't able to support their needs then its not unreasonable for them to do private trades like anyone else. I'm sure it's a mixture of both depending on market conditions.
edit: and that would actually affect the exchange price. Even off-exchange trading will likely be reflected in exchange prices eventually
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:00:09
Major high and then a crash immediately after?
@_date: 2014-01-03 17:11:53
That assumes the price they give to merchants is based on the exchange spot rate. They could be factoring in that discount.

Settlement on a trade is when both people have the actual assets they agreed to receive in exchange for what they sent to the other person. Even after a trade is executed, there's still a long lag time before it's "settled" and both sides can consider the trade completed because it takes a while to send cash or receive the actual security, commodity, etc. after the rate they're traded on is agreed to. 
Basically, bitcoin is a relatively fast payment method, which in theory could make it useful to settle trades comparatively quickly, even if you have to swap it to government money in the market once you receive the bitcoin. While it's quick, you'd still want to wait for multiple confirmations (blocks added to the block chain) before declaring the trade officially "settled." Since the market price of bitcoin could move against the government money you priced the trade in and expect to convert to upon receipt, you''d want to hedge against that risk.
The way exposure is hedged in currency markets is with swaps - an agreement to give someone currency now for an agreed upon amount back in the future. That difference between the two amounts is known as a 'swap rate.' So if you borrow money from me for one week, it would probably be at a 1-week swap rate. 
I think what he's getting at is the idea of a market that prices ultra short term swap rates based on blocks so people can hedge against rate volatility between the time a bitcoin transaction is sent and sufficiently confirmed. Those rates in sequence (1 block swap, 2 block swap, 3 block, etc) would create a trend known as a swap curve and enable people to hedge rate exposure on pretty much any bitcoin transaction. It's a concept used in pretty much all markets, but the concept here is totally unique to the needs of a virtual currency
@_date: 2014-07-16 16:37:40
Agree it's a cool path, but these guys have been established bitcoin experts for a long time. They used to be The Genesis Block and write a ton of great articles about pretty much everything crypto related. Sounds like their business has a different focus now but they're definitely not new to the space.
* edit: grammar
@_date: 2014-01-03 16:44:34
What would you propose here? It's resource heavy but incentivizing it is difficult unless they're also mining.
@_date: 2015-05-08 15:17:14
Surprised it's not higher. Why not sell if you're an existing holder?

This guy's drawings are awesome

This is driven somewhat by regulation. Banks used to be able to take risk with client money. It provided enough returns in the long run to offer interest on deposits, but with the new regs that protect against huge systematic events, banks can only use deposits for a very limited scope of investments, all of which have low returns due to QE. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 18:01:09
Actually looks great. Now they just need to fix the rest of the site.
@_date: 2015-02-25 14:01:51
It also offers the ability to hedge risk which allows for a variety of other transactions in the underlying economy to take place

Wow. Fuck off, BFL.

It's technically not "released" yet. Formal announcement scheduled to be later today at which time it will be the default latest software.

While I feel bad for you, this surprises no one.
@_date: 2013-04-16 14:22:36
It's possible but the cash flow logistics make this difficult. You have to get money into bitstamp with SEPA (from EU banks only), which could take days. The ability to move quickly to capitalize on arbitrage is all but negated because of this. It's nice in theory, but until a better system of moving government issued fiat exists, this is unlikely to be realistic.
Also, don't forget this is not normal. After fees of 2-5% moving your money around, on a normal day you'd actually end up behind.
@_date: 2013-06-27 13:53:58
On a large enough scale with confirmed, linked bank accounts, this isn't terribly difficult to do. The volatility risk gets distributed across a broad base during the transfer period for traditional currencies. 
That said, the tough part is building a company large enough to actually execute on that vision. Credit to the coinbase team for making it happen!
@_date: 2013-08-16 15:40:42
The entire network is predicated on the concept of economic incentives for mining. While some hobbyists may continue to mine for the good of the network/vision, if it's not economically attractive the network will lose massive amounts of computational power. Plus, companies are always going to have more cost effective ways of operating miners than individuals, so if anything the individuals would drop out first, save for a few idealists.

This article is worthless for anyone who knows more than surface level information about bitcoin. TC is the worst

Oh they take responsibility, huh? Fuck that. People are out thousands due to delays and network growth over that time. You're not taking responsibility until you give the money back.

"Never ascribe to malice that which is adequately explained by incompetence."
Half the stuff you read about a given equity even on sites like Bloomberg is partially informed at best. No reason for bitcoin to be any different.

It'll probably be more of a scan in store and pick up at the exit thing like they mention towards the end. Either way this sounds really cool. You could do it easily with credit card also, but glad to see it applied to bitcoin.

Agreed, but that's legislators, not regulators.

Looks like the 70% figure is talking about profitability (return on investment), but it depends on your network growth assumptions. plugging network growth into their mining dashboard at 50% reduces payout to 32.5%. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 15:10:06
Glad for the exchanges mentioned, but a bit saddened to see this kind of economic growth all occurring outside of the US as our regulators hamstring the players in our country who want to build similar companies.
@_date: 2013-06-27 13:57:34
If it's any consolation, it's probably far less that it was a few hundred years ago.

As nice as it would be, I'd imagine it's unlikely for Khan to step into that realm until there are established experts who can put together a course and they find a way to fit it as part of their ongoing curriculums. I've seen some people try this on Skillshare but the classes looked pretty weak.

Chinese markets didn't even react. Silk Road / drugs have no more affect on bitcoin markets now than some drug kingpin getting taken down would on other currencies. The only way price jumps from $10 to $140 stably in less than a year is if major institutional money comes in, and they wouldn't be playing in a market that goes under if some kid can't order ecstacy online anymore.

This was obviously going to happen after Cyprus, no matter how much the central bankers tried to act like it wouldn't. Makes sense to put creditors ahead, but ultimately everyone is screwed if these banks go under, depositors included if they can't get their cash out in time.

Someone asked the same question when it came out a week ago and I offered a similar answer then. I bought it am now about 3/4 of the way through - it's pretty long covering just about every relevant aspect of bitcoin. In terms of the content, someone behind this has clearly written professional financial research before. This isn't the standard bitcoin ramblings, as you'd probably guess if you read their blog posts. 
Some of the parts sort of brush over non-core topics and link to other posts that explains it in more detail, I'm assuming they did that just because it's already pretty long. The price probably seems high in bitcoin world, but for something like this in a serious financial market its dirt cheap (my firm pays 10x this for equity reports) and I'd guess that's the crowd they're targeting with this.
@_date: 2013-10-03 19:25:30
I bought it this morning and am about 1/4 through it with no regrets. The mining section is pretty intense.
I'm not sure if the bitcoin markets will support that price, but for the quality of work it's way undervalued in just about any other market. I've seen equity reports like this go for $500 easy.
@_date: 2013-06-24 16:12:20
That's a good point. You could also split the difference. Sell into Gox and wait for the price disparity to normalize over the next few days, then buy back BTC and cash out to fiat on another exchange. You'd hit some trading costs but with these kinds of margins you'd still come out ahead with effectively no risk.

Ha this is what I'm talking about... The posts are all from before the moves, so I'm not sure I follow your logic there.

I read it as the regulator actions not being attacks on bitcoin or new legistlation around crypto currencies, despite what many would imply
