There is literally no guarantee the blockchain will store messages like that forever. The devs won't mess around with changing transactions (although they HAVE changed those in the past, removing 50 blocks worth during a critical emergency involving a bug that let people make 184 billion valid bitcoin)  but there is absolutely no promise they will hold anything but financial transaction data sacred long term and will likely structure and restructure the blockchain as needed destroying all additional noncritical information like weird love messages.

It's the first, and a smug sense of superiority that whatever is first wins forever even though that has basically never been the case ever in any technology.

Wait, is deflation good or bad? I forget. These pump attempts go back and forth so fast!

Altcoins using almost identical code have thrown out individual transactions to return stolen coins.
Satoshi himself removed 50 blocks and all associated transactions (which weren't many) because of a bug that created cryptographically valid but totally unintended bitcoins (184 billion of them). 
It's absolutely possible for information to be removed from the blockchain, even transactions. But information that ISN'T transaction has no reason even at all to expect to stick around longterm.

You are saying that someone can have downloaded the thing separately, which is true but is in no way related to bitcoin and could be done without bitcoin. 
It is unlikely that in the next 50 years any data from the blockchain will still be there in current form. Except for the abstract values.

Okay, but what bitcoin owner is looking to get out of bitcoin and into NGN right now? Bitcoin can't be generated by magic, every seller has a buyer. every buyer has a seller. 
Who is selling bitcoin to buy NGN?

There is very little if any "computation" in hashing.  There is no "computational clout" in a few million dollars of asics doing one math problem medium fast.

Without a functional currency bitcoin can't help them. 
Who exactly is going to sell them bitcoin? if their currency is worthless? 
Bitcoin can be little help AFTER a currency collapses since once a person has lost all their wealth they can't buy bitcoin with it.

The blockchain is terrible for timestamping.  It does not and can not record the time of a transaction and does not and can not guarantee it will get into a block even the same hour, or event that there will BE a block the same hour. 
Also the time recorded on the blockchain is not even remotely accurate and many times the listed time on one block will be later than a block AFTER it.

It seems like if you present someone with a digital currency, the currency of the internet, etc and then your first advice is that you need to take it off the internet and away from computers and holding it on pieces of paper is the only safe way. You are going to instantly lose a lot of interest.

Ghandi wasn't really talking about libertarian money he was talking about social justice.

"many eyes" mostly only includes the eyes of people who are eyeing your money trying to sell you bitcoins.

It's cool when the mythical SJW don't even have to post and they can outsource the whining to people just making things up they "would say" to clog up threads. 
@_date: 2016-01-12 20:36:51
Where did the SJW touch you that you have become so scared of them that you need to come in random threads and freak out about what one might come and say?

what the hell is a "private lawsuit"? Tax dollars are going to be spent to fix the bitcoin ecosystem's fuck up,  it happens enough times and the answer will seem more and more "spend tax dollars to prevent these fuck ups"

Terrible is a wonderful description for a time stamping service that doesn't stamp the actual time or guarantee times will even be in the correct order!

For many people their primary interest in bitcoin is it making them personally wealthy, in this way it requires many many new newcomers funneling money to them and bitcoin being capped in users ruins that. Making all else irrelevant. 
I think you'd see many people here that would take a centralized government controlled bitcoin if it meant they personally could cash out at 500,000 a coin.

If the government has to step in and fix these exchanges mistake the next step is for the government to step in ahead of time to prevent them.  If the free market is supposed to control bitcoin let it.
