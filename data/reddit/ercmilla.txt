This guy is right on with respect to endowments.  Endowments' time horizons are extremely long.  They take on high risk profiles that other institutions can't or wont take.  They'll be buying crypto at least as a 1% position, probably more.

What language / tech did you use?

TN has a high sales tax at 10 percent.  It's great for investors.

Sensitivity is for the weak.

Nevermind.  Those bastards.

If you haven't lost 50% on an investment before, you haven't lived.

take the amount you want to buy and buy a smaller amount over the next X amount of days.  Dollar cost average yourself quickly into the market.

I read stuff like this and can't help but think: crypto doesn't create more rich people as mass adoption takes place.  It just transfers wealth to the early adopters.  There will be latter adopters, perhaps elderly.  That theoretical person will be broke.  You can imagine their dark story in opposition to this one.

No problem. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 21:24:56
What is the difference between a tx and a simple transfer?  Because transferring BTC between wallets is free, right?

Schiller has more to his resume than that lol

Wow.  May your balls be praised by the kekistani people.

I bought pretty high, but I'm DCAing.  I figure my pot odds are pretty good at this point lol.
@_date: 2018-02-16 16:33:05
Then everyone has to keep their own private dbs up to date and try to make them the same.  Lots of overhead.
@_date: 2017-09-11 16:20:33
I like coinbase, but also check out gemini.  Many times gemini's prices are lower.  Coinbase has more buying options straight from a credit card / checking account.

We. Are. Farmers.

If so, this possibility is already priced into gold.  Markets are efficient generally.  If you want to make money, DCA into diversified holdings and just chill until you want it.

Your storage of btc shouldn't be worth more than the btc itself.  You should have just bought more btc and used a paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-09-10 01:15:07
So it will show up in our coinbase account suddenly?
@_date: 2017-09-11 16:22:23
You don't need a hardware wallet for .25 btc.  A paper wallet will do just fine. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 14:52:10
I could have sworn transferring btc from coinbase to wallet was free.
@_date: 2017-09-14 04:41:02
Duude.  Unless you had an emergency, you shouldn't be selling.  This is literally the worst thing you could have done.  Buy back immediately unless you're trying to enter at a lower position, but no one knows if it will get any lower.

@_date: 2017-09-05 02:49:57
Why is coinbase 4300 then?  Have I been getting ripped off by them?
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:38:45
Should I buy in now?  I'm one of those FOMO people.
@_date: 2017-09-14 04:55:07
Well, this is a dip.  He wants to get in on the dip.  I'm just saying, don't just jump in all at once.

firstly, bitcoin is written in C++ - not java.  Secondly, hadoop is a distributed file system.  That also has nothing to do with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-05 02:51:33
Coinbase is 4300.  Are they ripping people off?

As an economics major, Shiller was one of my college heroes.  His opinion holds weight with me.  
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:17:51
Wow.  I had no idea!  This is so evil and gross.

I've heard of french dip and cheese dip, but this chinese dip is rather delicious.

Not saying it's fun or good.  Here's another one:  if you haven't been rejected by a girl out of your league, you haven't lived.
I'm just saying - taking chances in life comes with losses and wins.  But you gotta play the game. Sitting on the sidelines in life is no way to live.

They have been throwing this in our faces on cnbc for years.  Now this?!

Milton Friedman was my college hero.  To this day, I share his opinion on almost everything.  If only other smart people were this wise.

This is being so overblown.  One dude owns these local stations.  He wrote a piece and wanted them all to say it.  No conspiracy.  The real conspiracy is that US schools don't train their kids to think critically enough about what they read / hear.  But that's for another time.
