The best strategy to any new disruptive technology is not to fight it, but to embrace it, become an early adopter.  The government should get into the bitcoin mining business and bitcoin development business.  But not overtly.  They should also make an excuse to control importing and manufacturing of ASIC chips, perhaps invent a chip which is superior to ASIC.  If the resources of a super power like the US went all in, especially covertly into a future world wide monetary system.  They could profit and be in control of the bitcoin network for a very long time.  I'm sure such a project could even have a smaller budget than NASA.  And beware anti-statists if I thought of it,  I'm sure someone in halls of government have thought of it first.  The Leviathan will not be so easily slain.  But you might be able to force it to transform into something slightly different.

Never mind you were right it was in my spam folder.
I like the site so far, much better than localbitcoins.com.  I hope your site catches on.

Part of the problem to is the lack of imagination old ideologues have about innovation.  Political concepts can become too entrenched just like religious dogma.  We must be flexible with our political philosophies and perhaps invent new ones if we are ever to truly take advantage of innovations like bitcoin.
Bitcoin not only flattens the playing field when having to deal with governmental monopolies over currency.  But also the influence of large none-govermental agencies that want to control markets like corporations.
It would be a tragedy to pigeonhole bitcoin as a right wing libertarian tool.  It would be better if bitcoin could rise above the antiquated ideas of past generations.

Panarchy might be a natural occurring phenomenon of the internet.  A colonizing of virtual space, as if virtual space was a distant world where territorial governance has very weak influence over the colonists that live there.  And now because of bitcoin the colonists have created an economic standard.  The only thing missing is perhaps conflict and diplomacy resolution which is less mob rule (Anonymous Ops) and instead more formalized.  And which point a declaration of independence from certain types of territorial services, which need not be territorially bound.  Thus the birth of poly citizenship's, for example The American-Cyber Citizen or whatever your poly governmental identity might be.

Perhaps a pre-constitutional entity.  Perhaps the next step is an organized way of taking actions on issues which have mass appeal.  A system of ranking issues, then  discussing them, then taking meaningful action.  Especially issues that traditional governance are too slow or antiquated to deal with.  A system which is immune to small powerful elite groups that have entrenched interests.
