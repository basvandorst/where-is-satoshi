So they are then beholden to the investors and could be influenced to sway bitcoin in a direction that favors those investors and disfavors others.

So basically you're agreeing with me.  210000 is essentially zero compared with the value of all existing BTC at its present value.

He probably thought you had some kind of MLM angle.

Is there really much of a difference between $0.01 and $0.00?

Is the "vault" option on coinbase a safe place to store BTC?

Do you mean market cap?  I don't think there's 8.5 trillion dollars of gold changing hands daily.

What is a meaningful number?  Either none are significant, or the random milestones that humans give value to are.  Apparently some people feel this one is meaningful.

You realize that Coinbase really doesn't have a choice?  And that any institution that is going to act as an "on-ramp" for getting dollars into the crypto system in the US is going to come up against the exact same problem?  For me, I will continue to use them exactly because they comply to all applicable US law and regulations.  You see this as a minus, I see this as a reason to trust them to do my onramping.

So you see a company being on the up and up with federal law as equivalent to a Mt. Gox, who was essentially the exact shady opposite?  Who didn't care about or comply with any standards or regulations and basically stole all their customers' money?  How is this even at all a comparison?

I'm not doubting that it works, but this video isn't exactly proof. . . right about the time the barista was due to come back and confirm that the transaction worked, the video cuts out to a scene of them with their drinks. . .  
@_date: 2015-08-25 22:01:09
I believe you.  My point was that they made this video as "proof" of that, and they showed every mundane moment of this whole affair EXCEPT the part where the cashier confirmed that the transaction went through, literally the only part that actually counts as proof.

How is that a burn?   He bans people because government regulations, not because he's personally opposed.
Personal wagers between individuals are not regulated/illegal and he is free to do so at his own pleasure.  Quit acting like this is some kind of hypocrisy, it's not.

If I buy bitcoin as an investment, what would be the downside to buying on coinbase and just holding it in their "vault" as opposed to the wallet?  It would make me nervous having it myself and worrying about losing the paper wallet or hard drive/thumbdrive/trezor/whatever.
@_date: 2016-02-21 18:12:55
Agree.  I also object that they have to describe fiat currency as "real currency," implying that bitcoin is NOT real currency.

Nice of you to assume I believe everything I read.  The fact that I made this post would imply that I don't in fact believe, would it not?

So how can you possibly make that judgement about Augur at this point?  You could say that if the Augur team disbanded and stopped working on the project.  But as of now it's way too early to soundly proclaim Augur a failure.  Jumping to conclusions makes you sound a fool.  
Also, what promises are you talking about?  The only promises I've seen made are that Rep holders will get a % of trading fees.

I don't think Paul has ever "worked with" anyone.  Paul only spews his "genius" at those around him and complains about any ideas that weren't his.

Augur will eventually allow betting with bitcoin as well, and it's much closer to launch!

Who said anything about them just turning around and dumping them on the market all at once?  It's possible to buy them and then sell slowly.  That still puts downward pressure on the market.

Michael-Coinbase was fairly quick to respond here.  I had a problem with my account and I reached out to him a week or so ago and it was fixed within an hour.

You really think they WANT to shut down accounts and cause grief for people "Just 'cause they can?"
