You would have the same amount of BTC on exchange as you would in your wallet after the move. 
It's true there is some variance in price between exchanges. This is because different markets have different sizes, liquidity, consumers from different geographic locations, etc. For example, BTC in Venezuela sells for far above what it does in other countries, because demand is so high.
You don't 'gain' or 'lose' dollars until you sell BTC. So the short answer is unless you want to sell right now, there's no negative. Over time, exchanges fluctate up and down as people buy from the cheaper exchanges to sell on the more expensive ones. But this is done with many many computers and in large volumes to make a profit off of the comparatively small differences, and there's always a chance that the situation will be reversed by the time you actually make the move, or BTC's 'real price' (averaged through all exchanges) changes to displace the fluctations between exchanges.
In short, just get your BTC off of the exchange into the wallet and the price differences won't matter by the time you sell even a month from now, but definitely a year from now.

$100/$14000 = .0071 BTC (how much btc your $100 got you when you bought in) 
$17000*.0071 = $120.7 (value of your btc @ new price if you were to sell) 
$120.7-$100 = $20.7 (value minus cost = profit)

I just posted about this as well. You would need to use the BTC network to transfer the actual BTC between exchanges. That can take hours, too slow. If we stabilize around whatever price, then yes people will rush to Gemini for the 'cheap coins'.

Welcome! The answer I hear most to this question is buy some now buy some later. 
There are actually 3 ways to invest a lump sum.
All now: benefit the most immediately from exposure to the market.
Monthly or weekly basis: (dollar-cost averaging or DCA) buy a fixed amount, say $20 every monday no matter the price. Smooths out variance because you'll buy dips as well as peaks. But only moderate exposure to the market.
Wait for a dip: zero exposure to the market because your money isn't in BTC! but if you feel strongly that the market will go down, the same amount of money will purchase more millibits of bitcoin at the lower price.
I bought a little up front, a little when it rallies up, and a little when it goes down. Had I bought up front, I'd have better profits but a more stressful adjustment period/might have panic sold. I recommend 1/3 now, 1/3 every monday, and 1/3 reserve for dips. Good luck!

The lightning channel operator would have to pay network fees on the main chain to settle their balance. And presumably, the amounts would be small enough in lightning channels that the trust isn't a factor – exactly the same reason credit cards are used for small amounts. Now that I think about it, the only reason a company with your credit card info CAN'T just go buy an iPhone on your card is the fear of repercussions.
I don't know enough to evaluate that as a solution to the scaling problem, but thanks for the link.

Gemini and Coinbase are two different 'exchanges' where you can buy cryptocurrencies with real money. They are functionally similar. The differences between the two are that 1) they're run by two different companies 2) Coinbase has higher fees at ~3% where Gemini is ~0.25% 3) you can fund your Coinbase account via credit card, whereas you can only fund Gemini through bank transfer or wire transfer (However, Gemini also gives you access to your funds once you initiate the deposit i.e. you can trade with it 'instantly'. Similarly, Coinbase 'locks in' the price when you click buy, even if the funds haven't cleared yet.) 4) Gemini doesn't have a mobile app, I think Coinbase does.
You should be able to buy as small a quantity of bitcoin as you want on either Coinbase or Gemini. Also of note is GDAX is run by Coinbase (same login info and everything) but has lower fees at 0-0.25%.
For all exchanges, you don't control the private keys, they do! So a few weeks after you have the coins in your account, you should look on the sidebar about setting up your own paper or hardware wallet to keep your coins safe. Cheers

19.5 lasted but a moment! At different time scales it's averaged differently. Look for some minute by minute graphs and compare to the weekly.

Any sale, even on an exchange, is a taxable event. So you're right and the redditor above you is wrong. Doesn't matter if you withdraw.
I am also looking for a FIFO calculator or spreadsheet as calculating cost-basies is going to be a nightmare.

Same! They're going to be stuck either way, the question is are they stuck before or after you get the chance to act with those funds. Obviously using them earlier is far better.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:42:52
Wait for your payment to process and the coins to appear in your account. Could be up to a week. Then, make a paper wallet or buy a hardware wallet and in coinbase, send them to your own wallets receiving address. Check out the sidebar, cheers.

GDAX, Gemini are both 0.25%

Good, this clicks for me. But security-wise LN requires some degree of trust between the two transacting parties, yeah? I suppose the same amount of trust as giving a company your credit card info...

why are Total Received and Final Balance different? I get that he had to withdraw at certain points, but his balance was never anywhere close to the 59BTC displayed under Total Received.

It's good, although it did go down around the run up to 9k for several hours. Coinbase was only down then for about one hour. Even so, that's the only outage I can remember.
I will say that they fund your deposit instantly so you can trade with it. Which GDAX doesn't do and gives Gemini a huge advantage in my mind.

You have to report all purchases and sales, in the US at least. Don't be stupid, pay your taxes.

If this is the case then the whales will benefit the most from the (artificial scarcity). You better hope no one owns 'most' of the BTC

This ideal is unenforceable. If transactions are truly anonymous, then government will have the same power. If they're truly traceable, then citizens will also be tracked. You can't have both.

Price of bitcoin always spikes, crashes, plateaus, repeats. 
What if this time it's different? Doesn't the amount of big money and attention on bitcoin means the price will never meaningfully rise again? Earnestly asking if there's any legitimacy to this line of thought.

General public and banks offering investments to the public, yes, we're not quite there yet. But as early as 2016/17 I recall signs of price manipulation/direct corporate investment, and once that stuff starts it doesn't exactly stop.
