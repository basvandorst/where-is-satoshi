@_date: 2015-12-22 07:05:15

I got my account limited to $100/day for suspected localbitcoins trading, coinbase sucks
@_date: 2015-12-09 04:18:26
Why do they have someone giving the interviews that obviously doesn't understand computer science 
@_date: 2015-12-24 20:19:38
Is he really in jail? I don't see anything that says that
@_date: 2015-12-22 07:05:56
oh, ok so they weren't ever stolen by him or someone else?
@_date: 2015-12-09 03:46:05
wait if he edited it to include evidence doesn't that just mean the evidence is pointless and he's probably not nakamoto?
@_date: 2015-05-04 14:56:24
Yea they're pp mycash cards, they're probably carded or some shit, I'm gonna stay away

what if I already have a bank account in eastern europe though?
@_date: 2015-05-14 04:43:08
word just made an account this looks like it'll work
@_date: 2015-05-03 22:30:27
This dude has over 1k trades though and is promoted on the front page of localbitcoins, do you honestly think he's a scammer?

THIS MARKET COLLAPSE IS ACTUALLY GOOD NEWS
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:12:01
Yea bitcoin is going to be way better after we've purged all the flaky people that don't want to use a currency that drops by 40% overnight. Also gotta purge all the bitcoin backed startups and services that are suffering huge losses right now like cex.io and everyone else engaged in mining etc. because that will definitely be in bitcoins better interest long term
Even if you've been in since $5/btc and are still in the green a 40% decrease in market cap is a really really bad thing for bitcoin
Those of us that have been around for a while aren't freaking out obviously, every time you take a loss like this with bitcoin you get a little bit more jaded (same goes for the opposite direction), but all the "this is actually good news for bitcoin" shit is so dumb oh my god
@_date: 2015-01-14 09:00:45
yea, the problem with your logic is right now people think bitcoin is worth $180, which is still a pretty huge rise unless you bought in when it was $1200 lol
@_date: 2015-01-14 09:41:48
literally the dumbest and most desperate logic i've ever heard
@_date: 2015-01-17 20:35:06
Wow that sucks, sorry dude. I know this doesn't help in your situation but safe deposit boxes are $10/year at my local credit union, that's where I keep my bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 09:16:13
fuck off neckbeard, a small business owner has every right to stay away from a currency that can potentially loose 2/3 its value overnight. 
he's right though, you're not exposed to any volatility if you're using coinbase/bitpay etc. since you aren't actually holding any coins
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:44:45
I hope your joking, because people actually say shit like that on here
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:54:52
I think he's trying to imply that the price crash is le market manipulation by institutional investors in order to acquire cheap bitcoin
@_date: 2015-01-13 22:08:58
past performance =/= future performance, every time bitcoin crashes there's some shit like this on the front page of it's so dumb
@_date: 2015-01-14 09:29:24
Yes it is. They already bought the bitcoin and nobody on understands how 'market manipulation' actually works
@_date: 2015-05-14 04:31:22
yea there is only problem is I charge like 3% when I make cash trades with customers and the atm charges like 12%. also don't want to have to go to an atm every time I need coin
@_date: 2015-08-03 21:52:08
The next begins when satoshi starts moving his 10% of the btc network
