Does GDAX have instant buy ACH? My experience with GDAX is depositing to Coinbase, wait 5 days, transfer to GDAX, then trade. I cited 2% because that is Coinbase's instant buy option that is a direct apples to apples comparison to Gemini.

Can you finish your analogy by explaining the bus company's business model? Was the bus company profitable with 10 riders paying any price? If bus ticket price is not a primary source of income for the bus company, would you advocate eliminating the bus ticket price completely? Unlimited seats for free? What is the purpose of charging for bus tickets?

Oh sorry, didn't know it was a calculable probability.  Source?

The difference is that Coinbase charges you 2% for that luxury and Gemini charges 0.25%.

5 years ago the price was $5. Your equivalent argument back then would have been 3 cents a day.  And we would have outperformed by 20x ($50 vs $1000).  You need to think in percents. Our past 5 years works out to 9% per month. More recently we are more like 8% per month.  If we maintain a steady 8%, that's $100,000 in 5 years. 6% would be $33k. 4% would be $10k.

Strange. Called him out for deliberately trying to discredit the sub and blamed it on trolls posting controversial content to get a response. Sounds familiar...

That would be a decelerating rate.  It needs to add 22% per month.  The rate over the past year has been about 8% per month.  Rate over the past 5 years has been about 10% per month.  If the 8% continues, we will see 10k halfway through 2019.  If it slows to 6%, then we will see 10k halfway through 2020.  
Those predictions are for steady underlying growth and not including bubbles.  Considering we have seen our current level in a bubble 3 years ago, it's not so far fetched to imagine a bubble during 2017 equal to the eventual 2019 or 2020 value.  So from a bubble standpoint, Tim may be right.

You've been on an aggressive campaign to convince people that the ETF is guaranteed to fail.  How low do you think the price is going to dip when the ETF fails?

Not necessarily. There is nothing magical about &gt;1mb that makes the network immune to malicious spam attacks. I would expect these people to scale up their attacks until they either get their way or break Bitcoin.

I'm surprised they use this subreddit as their primary communication channel for critical software updates. Especially after being so critical of people talking about the update on social media.

I did the same transition. Delayed deposits and low limits convinced me to move.

Over how many years? It has been below 2.5% for the part 5 years. 2015 was basically a 0% year but now we are seeing it surge back up.
@_date: 2017-01-18 01:56:30
I just logged in to see what you are talking about.  Looks like a 0.5% premium beyond the GDAX spread.  It's a sneaky way to charge 2% fees while advertising 1.5%.  And all three of those numbers are higher than Gemini's 0.25%.  Unbelievable.

$2 to $802 from the increase in market cap. Larger if you pare down the market cap to what's actually available for sale. But ultimately not the driving force behind this $30 dollar surge.

My reasons are different from most, but worth noting:
- They require 6 months to raise limits to useful levels
- They hold ACH transfers 2-4 days longer than industry standard
- Their system sometimes requires a poke (log in and check account) to clear a transfer. An overdue transfer will be listed as pending when you log in, then 10 minutes later you will receive notification that your transfer just went through at 2am on a weekend. 
I could see the longer transfer times being used for risk protection, but only if their transfer limits reflected an increase in risk. My guess is that they are actively trading deposits for those 2+ extra days, sometimes holding longer because of market conditions. When you poke the system, it exits the market and gives you your deposit.
I swapped to a competitor with no deposit limit and on-time ACH transfers. Given your situation, I say stick with Coinbase. We all have different needs. If Coinbase is meeting your needs, then it's not worth the hassle to swap to another service.

Can you explain the importance of phones in this argument? I understand storage and bandwidth as direct links to bitcoin, but I don't see the relevance of phones.
@_date: 2016-12-18 20:46:28
Yes they should take the same number of days. But they don't. This is a problem because Coinbase doesn't disclose what they do with your funds for those 2-4 extra days. Meanwhile Gemini deposits are available instantly. This is a big difference.

You are only looking at one way transactions. Money laundering would be buying into bitcoin with dirty money, then cashing out for clean money. ID rules limit the use of Coinbase as a money laundering service. No it doesn't stop all money laundering in the world.

What is your opinion on SWR and cfiresim?
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:38:29
Not really.  The stable price on Jan 1, 2013 was 13.5 and it was 230 in April 2013.  That's a 17x gain.  We aren't close to a 17x gain.
You're not wrong about being worried about a correction.  We're at a make-or-break threshold where the price must either return or it will escalate to 20x levels like 2011 and 2013.  But this bubble is still pretty small compared to them.
@_date: 2017-05-10 05:04:38
Yes, I've seen &gt;10k daily dips as recently as last week. It's not as hard as you make it out to be. 3 reasons. First you also see similar sized gains. Second, taxes make you think twice about taking short term gains. You need a pretty big pullback to offset the advantage of &gt;1 year capital gains tax. And third, my target is a lot further out than a 10k daily swing, so it's easy to ignore them.

Ok let's play out your scenario.  Someone pays the seller's asking price and the price goes up.  The ask order in the ask table flashes.  What color does it flash?  Green.  The executed order is added to the far right price history table.  What color is it listed as in the history table?  Green.  One of the lines moves in the order depth graph.  Which line?  Red line.  Which way does it move?  Down.
In summary, price went up, green flashed everywhere, red line got smaller.

Historic stock market return is 7% per year.  The long term steady growth of Bitcoin outside of bubbles is about 150% per year.  If you put 5% of your stock portfolio in Bitcoin, you could expect a similar return as the stock market (0.05*1.5 = 0.075).  So make a request to your parents to put 5% of your portfolio in Bitcoin for 6 months (or some fixed date when you will agree to re-evaluate its performance with them).  
Absolute worst case you lose 5% of your portfolio (use historic portfolio performance to show that a 5% drawdown isn't the end of the world).  Your target performance is to match the raw profit of your stock market earnings.  If you meet this target, then it will be easy to make a case to increase your exposure.  Manage risk, set targets, show achievement, negotiate for more.

First let's start with colors.  Everything on bitcointicker is consistently colored.  Green means the event should make the price go up (more people want to buy).  Red means the event should make the price go down (more people want to sell).
Now to the chart on the bottom left.  The line graph is the depth of the order book.  It is a visual representation of the "Bid" and "Ask" columns on the right.  The X axis is the price and the Y axis is how many coins you could buy or sell for that price.  The lines are always sloped down towards the middle because it is a cumulative collection of offers available.  If you look at the Bids column (green), read the volume of the first 5 offers and you get 0.0+5.2+4.1+5.2+1.0 = 15.5 at a price of 2507 (the price of the 1.0 volume offer).  So the green line graph should be 15.5 at 2507.  The faded line graphs are just showing recent history.
Looking at the graph in the screenshot, the green line has a big slope and the red line has a shallow slope.  This means a lot of people want to buy and not many people want to sell.  A small market buy could easily wipe out that flat zone on the red curve and move the price higher.  But a small market sell order would barely nibble at the green line.  The price probably went up after you took this screenshot.
The bar chart behind the line graph is just recent movement.  If more volume is added at a price, they add a bar going up.  If volume is removed at a price, the bar goes down.  It helps you get a feel for the direction the price is moving.  These bars follow the red/green rules from above.  More buy offers (left side) or less sell offers (right side) imply upwards price movement, so they are green.
Now the highlights on the Bid/Ask columns.  A highlight just mean that the volume at that price has changed.  An order has been added or deleted.  Green means upwards price pressure and red means downwards price pressure.  If offers are added to the buy side, they will be green.  If offers are added to the sell side, they will be red.  Greyed out numbers just mean the offers have been sitting there for over a minute.  They are still active.
