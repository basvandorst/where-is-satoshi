You're certainly right, BTC's public opinion has drastically changed since a year ago.  
@_date: 2015-12-11 18:33:00
I found it is mostly dependent on the news outlet. Finance oriented site, like Bloomberg and The Economist, tend to be more informed and up to date with BTC development,  while technology site and conventional news site still talk about buying drugs and Karpeles.

Honestly, that's a good article. No mention of Mt.Gox or Silk Road and slightly touches mining and block size.

This. Bitcoin needs an easy way to acquire it. Paypal could solve this issue, while gathering some fees. I would'nt mind the fees to get this kind of service.

Upvoted for the magnificient pun

0,7 BTC were sold at this price for a grand total of 0.66$

I actually used e-interac yesterday and thought the same thing at first. Lower fees, anonymity, control over your money, no need for a bank account, international currency are all advantages Bitcoin has over e-interac, and I'm sure I'm missing some.

Current price is around 700 $ on VoS. I'd prefer to pay taxes on 700 $ than sell at 0,85 $.

I'd say he means everything about the money you made or the amount of Bitcoins you own.

I like this new trend! Upvote for you
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:04:31
Exactly, I don't see any official source on this topic. It has affected the price a lot, which indicates that people believe it, but I can't seem to find a single reliable source.
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:55:53
It just proves how unpredictable this is. People shouldn't post threads like that, they look like Pump/Dump attempts.
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:51:05
Yet, 7 days ago you posted : 
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:59:53
I'm also holding strong. I don't care if I lose my investment, I don't need the money right now and I still believe in BTC, so I don't see any reason to sell.
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:59:31
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:43:39
If I based my trading on that yes, but I'm holding until I either reach my goal or need the money. I don't care if I lose it all before that.
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:11:49
No doubt about that. I'm used to this roller coaster ride. I keep all my Bitcoins/Litecoins in cold storage, in order to avoid trading emotionally. Cold storage, coupled with the fact I'm a lazy ass, is a very effective barrier against panic selling.
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:48:32
Yeah I saw that thank you. I can't read chinese and Google translate sure ain't helping. Is there a reliable source mentioned in this article?
@_date: 2013-12-17 15:39:40
Will do! Quick question, will it be (is it) available in Canada?
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:12:06
Really? You again? 
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:13:38
Your title makes it seem like something real bad happened to that rep shortly after.
@_date: 2013-12-17 15:22:16
Great! I wish you guys the best. Nice business idea. Can't wait to be able to pay in Bitcoin and Litecoin.
@_date: 2013-12-25 20:28:37
Well, it does say "fabriqué au Canada", so I assume it´s in Québec. Since you said it wasn't Montréal, I'll go with Québec city. (Crosses fingers) 
I'd probably try it now if that was the case.
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:49:31
I like your comments history. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:40:48
I thought banks were out of the deal since early December, leaving only third-party payments. If this rumor turns out true, I guess Bitcoin won't make it into the Chinese market at least for a couple years.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:45:59
Ok thank you!
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:19:20
It's about a place where you can buy sneakers/shoes for Bitcoins
@_date: 2013-12-17 15:22:42
Redditor since 5 minutes...
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:23:47
I doubt Benny would go on and talk bullshit here.
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:48:41
That's not a different source. It's the same article that's been linked to non-stop since yesterday... It still isn't an official statement from the PBOC.
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:42:30
This was marked as a scam this week, don't fall for it.
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:03:22
Seriously, this news, if proven true, would be bad news. Is it true or not, I don't know, but it seems so does everybody. I want people to come into this thread looking for a reliable source and, upon realizing that there's none, realize they need to use critical thinking. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 14:43:15
Don't listen to this guy, look at his comment history...
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:14:21
It's better in English, I tried in french first ;) Still, I would like a statement from someone who was at the meeting or an official statement from the government.
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:13:20
Well, I'm not saying I like Dogecoin, I just think it's funny.
@_date: 2013-12-17 15:32:45
I heard about Coinkite, but didn't had time to read about your services yet. Will do that during the holidays break.
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:41:30
Shows how fragile the market is.
