Well shit, if a cop says it happened, it must be true. ;)

Certainly not the first time someone has used Bitcoin to buy Molly... ;)

That will be proven over time, not by divulging their proprietary plan.

As a non-liberal in favor of drug policy reform, I don't see how conservatives can wish to maintain a policy that has grown the government tremendous amounts, not to mention costs thousands of lives annually south of our border.  Imagine how awesome it would be to be able to eliminate an entire federal agency (DEA) plus re-purpose (or eliminate through attrition) tens of thousands of LEO positions, saving literally billions of dollars.  We could then use those billions to ship ethnic minorities back to where they came from, or you know, whatever it is your people would do with that money.

Are you trolling or are you seriously advocating for prohibitionist drug policy on Reddit?

I'd accept PayPal donations too.  Not because I support the platform, but to reach a broader audience of those who want to donate.

$6,500/mo. is not what a "normal person" pays for rent in Manhattan.  In most of lower Manhattan, a studio can be found for under $1,500, 1 BR for under $2,000, and 2 BR for under $2,500.  The average income for Manhattan residents is a little over $75K, and therefore even if one put 100% of their pre-tax salary to rent, one could not afford $6.5K/mo.

I don't know about you, but they are *constantly* trying to break down my city wall...
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:30:18
Why should they?

That's probably exactly it.  Imagine if he has millions invested when BTC is at $10 and says, "well, I can borrow from my clients and buy a car, can always pay them back!"  So he sells BTC5,000 to buy his car.  Fast-forward to when BTC is at $500 and he wants to pay these clients back.  He doesn't owe them $50,000 anymore, he owes them $2.5 million.  Oops.

A quick Craigslist search shows you can easily beat $1,500 in Astoria, and in far out B'klyn, you're not even close.

Cash advance fee can be avoided by using a debit card, and the "19% interest" is just what your particular card charges.
There's obviously a risk of fraud -- they feel that they've mitigated it by requiring Facebook linking and charging a steep % over the value of the coin.  Is it enough?  Who knows.

Sensationalized title.  Clevelander is in no way the "most popular bar" (it's a shithole) and there is no causation demonstrated between the $100K in "additional sales" and acceptance of Bitcoin.  That is, they didn't actually take $100K in BTC.
