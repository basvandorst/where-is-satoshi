You won't see Bitcoin under 2000 till october for sure. However, if Chinese will do some crazy shit, back stab the BIP91 or something then we can see it go even to 1k$
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:44:21
oh... Well its not a case for Bitcoin anymore I think.
@_date: 2017-07-18 10:47:33
? I am just a realist person, not shy to share the point of view. People sometimes taking things for certain, but they dont have to be certain.
And thats a thing in XRP case. Holders of XRP think they will become millionaires because banks are connecting with Ripple, but they don't know banks will also have to use the Token itself to get the price pumped up.

But there must be something positive as the price of BTC rise from 1900 on Sunday to almost 2300 today morning:P  
@_date: 2017-07-18 13:25:32
will go for sure to 2500+ then go down again.
@_date: 2017-07-18 10:39:37
So basically, if things will stay as they are now, the price of BTC will not go down significantly anymore? However if Chinese back stab then the prices will go down a lot? 
And if the Chinese would back stab, what date would suit them :D?

The panic still to come, if the split will come to reality, and if the Bitcoin Cash will be supported by Jihan aka Bitmain then Houston we got problem.
@_date: 2017-07-18 22:55:12
Don't be surprised soon:)
@_date: 2017-07-19 15:36:51
I smell like this BIP91 may fail at the end... This would be so bad for the price I can imagine
@_date: 2017-07-19 13:57:25
Are they? which ones.
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:54:30
I dont know, but I wouldn't be surprise if from today the price of Bitcoin will just go up until HF in nov.
@_date: 2017-07-18 12:00:39
What about it? They want to back stab?
@_date: 2017-07-18 16:04:03
@_date: 2017-07-24 11:43:03
Are you braindead? Bitcoin Cash is core of Bitcoin, not a fucking altcoin. Get ur facts straight.
@_date: 2017-07-19 17:33:33
most likely there won't be any BIP91, I don't see it happen as u mention its not stable.. seems like miners playing game.
@_date: 2017-07-22 19:41:54
BTC Cash
@_date: 2017-07-23 22:07:27
ofc I am trolling...
@_date: 2017-07-19 12:13:41
still anything can happen.
@_date: 2017-07-19 14:02:31
no idea:P Will see where it will head in next few hours
@_date: 2017-07-24 14:14:48
@_date: 2017-07-19 13:53:07
