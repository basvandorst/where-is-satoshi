not trying to sound stupid, but what would be the best way to do it? keeping all that money on an exchange surely isnt safe? if he keeps it stored in bitcoin, what if the price goes down? so what would be best to do in this situation?

even transactions aside, im still really new to bitcoin but from what i know so far, even if you just want to hodl, its much safer to store it on such device as opposed to an app or so.

What Podcasts do you recommend?

thanks for the feedback
if you go through the first 3 pages of r/Bitstamp/ is literally just people complaining, either they cant get verified, cant deposit or cant withdraw. this tweet just confirms that currently it might not be the best idea to register with them.. wich sucks, since there are not many alternatives in germany

I thought it came from somebody who was to excited and therefore it's just a typo

when does a hardware wallet make sense? only passed a certain amount? would it be worth it for something as little as 100$/€?
