Woops, sorry, should've posted it.

At this point, most engines in MV-mode show you some moves with very similar evaluations, so this is the position we need.

Didn't Bitcoin go into insolvency?
@_date: 2014-03-02 19:29:40
Ah, alright.
@_date: 2014-03-02 19:24:50
Just so I'm not wasting my ressources on something wrong: White's next move and the position after executing the move are what's necessary for solving this, right?
@_date: 2014-03-02 19:33:37
Alright, got it. Thanks to for the puzzle : )
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:03:28
Good luck.

I won't sell anytime soon. See it this way: Even if the bitcoin price crashed brutally, a single coin is still worth a multiple of what it was worth some months ago. And that rise from 13 to 25 to 100 bucks was before the recent hype, if I'm not mistaken.
@_date: 2013-04-15 18:32:20


You trolls are really getting lazy.
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:13:12
Greed and stupidity go hand in hand, as seen with the recent bubble.
@_date: 2013-07-16 21:30:25
I really thought you were giving tips regarding Bitcoin. Have a funny gif for being awesome: 
@_date: 2013-08-08 17:04:07
50 BTC sound fair?
@_date: 2013-06-07 13:18:23
On keyboards without umlauts, you can write 'schön' as 'schoen' and nobody will get angry at you. So you didn't say anything ridiculous : D
@_date: 2013-10-23 12:55:03
So yeah, I have like, to, totally give this presentation too, you know. And, I dunno, I will talk about Bitcoin. Halp plx?
No, seriously, you're doing god's work.
@_date: 2013-10-24 16:08:53
Nice idea, but Jolly Ranchers? : (
@_date: 2013-04-21 19:15:17
BUY! BUY! BUY!
Funny enough, I was thinking about something very similar just yesterday, but instead just used the figures of the country I live in. My conclusion was basically the same: If Bitcoin doesn't bust, it has to and inevitably will go up, up up. Well, your writeup was way nicer than mine.
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:39:10
Error 500 here, too.

I'll just quote Immortal Technique: They can suck my diiiiick.

But aren't most Blackjack tables these days with more than one deck anyway?
@_date: 2013-06-26 21:05:22
German here, I could get it just fine over my local amazon. Did you try that?
@_date: 2013-08-05 22:37:35


You don't need to mine to obtain bitcoins, it's just a possibility for people with strong graphic cards (not so much any more) or dedicated hardware to make a little money.
You don't need to download a program to use Bitcoins, either. The only thing you need is a bitcoin address, which you can get for example at blockchain.info
From there, you can receive and send Bitcoins to your liking (and your wallet balance).


This is in the nature of Bitcoin. A single coin is infinitely divisible and as such, half a coin is just as easily to manage as a 100000th of a coin.
@_date: 2013-04-20 10:59:06


Yeah, err, no.
@_date: 2013-05-06 21:17:05
Ah, I see. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-07-16 21:39:16
Yay, thanks!
@_date: 2013-05-06 20:36:37
On a related note, if I figured out the private key, what exactly would I have to do with it to get my free internet mooniez?
@_date: 2013-10-24 19:56:14
I've been on reddit too long to not associate bad things with Jolly Ranchers.
@_date: 2013-08-31 19:47:58
Note to myself: Call more people on reddit 'faggots'.
@_date: 2013-08-06 14:49:42
Alright, I should have made clear that by "infinitely divisible" I meant "by design, you can divide it further than just into satoshis, but this isn't possible right now."
@_date: 2013-04-29 12:40:19
Care to elaborate? Because I can throw fancy 1-sentence-statements around as well. If you want bitcoin to succeed ...
* grind the bones of a chicken, make a soup from the powder and drink it
* dance at midnight on the grave of your city's richest man
* hoard like a mofo
You see how this works, right?
@_date: 2013-08-23 23:24:46
We better shut down this Internet if it's being used be pedophiles!
@_date: 2013-05-06 21:18:26
bitcoin.de is pretty good in my opinion.
@_date: 2013-04-29 12:13:57
I used to use blockchain, but then I got paranoid regarding the issues that they had, so I transferred the little I have to a local wallet.
Aside: How cool is it you can basically download money with bitcoin? Now you're not limited to downloading RAM anymore.
@_date: 2013-04-04 15:40:34
"So where do I sign up for those free internet mooniez?"
@_date: 2013-09-25 16:49:56
You might want to post this in the german btc subreddit, not this one.
@_date: 2013-04-19 18:12:02
I'm not that much into Blackjack, care to explain what's fishy here?
@_date: 2013-05-06 16:31:48


Nope, eats a whole lot more power than the PC just idling. You have to imagine all those graphics cards working nonstop at full power, and they need energy for this.


There are specific mining tools you could use, no need for any BTC client.


Well, you could join a pool, which is pretty advisable even with 30 powerful GPUs since the difficulty is so high. That way, every share one of your GPUs finds will be sent to the same address.
