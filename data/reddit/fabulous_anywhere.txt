He is obviously asking where to spend bitcoin, the answer is nowhere. Nobody will accept your shitcoins without you paying the high fee of converting to fiat in one way or another. Some stores will even just tag on +$10 fee for zero reason like shitrefill, which keeps getting recommended here for some reason.

99% of this sub thinks it's a good idea to write down your key and store it anywhere, why hack someone's computer in the first place when you can just visit their house while they're at work.

What are you talking about? 95% of these are real money in, monopoly money out. You can't exchange your BTC for cahs, it's only cash for digital trash (with 30% fee).

The same reason you don't withdraw your cash from the bank and bury it? so many fucking stupid ideas are why this sub gives me cancer.

The lira is going to shit soon. If I had BTC I'd liquidate asap before the obvious US crackdown crushes the price.

Why does it feel good to get paid in btc? what does it actually enable you to do?
Keep in mind you will be paying more tax than the btc is worth when it finally dumps, so you may actually be losing money by taking payment in btc.
