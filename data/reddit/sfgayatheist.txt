You're mixing two unrelated issues.  Government workers, like any other workforce, have the right to organize and collectively bargain for their wages and compensation.  The fact that the rest of us surrendered that right to the Oligopoly decades ago doesn't mean that government workers should be forced to do the same.

That doesn't always go your way.  If you have 2 factor authentication on your account and money is wired out of the country you can kiss it goodbye.  The bank can't get it back and if the security breach was in your equipment then they are not responsible.

Because Bitcoin has the potential to get rid of the parasitic banker class that consumes a significant percentage of GDP while providing nothing.  Government provides education, roads, stable infrastructure, laws, and more that justify the taxes that we are asked to pay. While I don't agree with everything government does, I strongly believe that society is better off with governance than without it.

Power grows incrementally with wealth. If you take government away, the power will rest solely with those who have wealth.

Government workers don't create those laws, elected representatives do. If you don't like the laws you run for office or help elect someone who will better represent your interests. I understand that reality is a lot more complex than this but government workers aren't permitted to just create taxes and fines whenever they feel like it.

You don't understand.  As soon as the session was taken over, the attacker could feed whatever he wanted to the victim.  Most likely, the attacker just let the victim complete whatever he was going to do then just kept the session open when the user clicked "log off".
The only way your 2-factor could be better is if you have to re-enter your authentication key as you enter each transaction.  If your account requires entering your 2-factor key several times inside a single session, then your security may be adequate to prevent this kind of attack.
It still doesn't change the fact that you should only access your bank website from a trusted computer which has neither Flash nor Java installed and which is not used for browsing the internet.  It also doesn't change the fact that these kinds of crimes are not limited solely to bitcoins.

How did you arrive at that conclusion?

If the computer is never connected to a network, it is secure even without the patches.  You could build an offline machine, use it to generate your public keys, and then keep it disconnected from the network.  Of course, physical theft could still mean the theft of your private keys.
That being said, if you ever connect this machine to the internet it will be far behind on updates and then will be a large security risk.  Keep it offline permanently.

Not really, it is just a problem in general.  I know of an individual who got a very large sum of money (over $250,000) stolen out of his bank account even though he had 2 factor authentication.  His computer had been compromised, and the hacker just waited until the individual logged into the bank.  He then was able to take over the session and access the bank account at will.  The bank determined the bank was not responsible for the fraudulent transaction and this business nearly went under due to the massive loss.
These problems are not unique to Bitcoin but are just a fact of life in the 21st century.  People are going to need to get more serious about computer security if they want to protect themselves.

I'm afraid I don't agree.  While poor governance is a hindrance, good governance allows for a society to operate with consistent rules for everyone to play by.  Just take a look at all the countries in the world that have weak governments, they are all dominated by criminal enterprises or international corporate interests.  Effective government that is answerable to the people is the only hedge against these interests.
The government shouldn't be for sale.  If it is, the solution is to develop a better government, not fall back on some kind of anarchist fantasy.  But by all means, move to Darfur and prove to us all how much better an anarchist state can be than a governed one.

Being a "real" company is kind of meaningless and the fact that its in China should be another red flag on this kind of investment.  Traditional stocks in US companies are subject to strict regulatory oversight and publicly traded companies must play by a certain set of rules when it comes to disclosures and shareholder rights.  I admit that I'm ignorant of the laws in China, but I'd be rather surprised if foreigners would be left with any legal recourse if Asicminer decided to disappear overnight with your money.
This may very well be a sound investment, or you may lose every dime you invest.  Invest with this in mind.

So did our customers bank. The hacker had compromised the authorized signers computer. When he signed on to authorize some payments, the attacker took over his web session (all of his traffic was being diverted through a proxy server) and was able to transfer the money because the session had been properly authenticated. 
2 factor authentication cannot protect you from all forms of attack.

No they cannot.  They would have to physically enter the premises and implant something on the computer or seize it.

It makes sense when you consider that some unscrupulous individuals have seized machines they do not own and used them for mining.  While the applications themselves are not viruses, administrators of large computer networks might want to be made aware that these applications are running on their systems.  Anyone using their computer for legitimate mining can just add the miner to the antivirus exclusion list.

Probably not, but it would certainly be possible after the "free market" is finished consolidating every phone company into a single entity.


If I own a bunch of drones and there's no government to stop me, I could pretty much kill whoever I wanted to and get away with it.


Again, if I have all the wealth and you have none, I can jail you or just outright end you for any reason with no fear of consequences to myself.  The drug laws are unjust, certainly, but there is a legal process involved that is somewhat open.  Furthermore, laws can be changed when a large enough grassroots movement decides that they need to be changed (as is happening with Cannabis prohibition even now).

This is obviously a different kind of authentication than was used in our case.  Most 2 factor authentication tokens require you to merely enter the token key at login which then authenticates you for the entire session.

But it's not the same kind. There are functional differences between btc and litecoin. For one, ltc blocks are designed to complete faster meaning transactions are confirmed more quickly. Even a small difference like that means that there could be niche markets where ltc is preferred to btc.

That's nonsense.  The Clean Air Act did reduce the amount of pollutants in the air.  It was and still is opposed by many 'existing rich businesses.'  
While it may be true that some regulations are handouts to big business, it is just factually incorrect to state that such is always the case.

In general business terms, this is a very fast ROI and imho indicates that the hardware is not overpriced.  Server hardware is typically purchased with a 3-year investment in mind so something paying for itself in less than a year is generally considered really good.

You kind of took a leap off the deep end with that plan.  Storing your OS on removable encrypted media requires a fairly high level of experience to pull off properly.
If you're storing your wallet in an encrpyted file on an offline computer, you're probably going to be fine without the disk encryption.  If it is physically stolen the odds are that the thieves won't know what to do with the data they have obtained anyways.  Your greatest risk is theft over the internet which is alleviated by keeping the computer offline.
Of course, make sure you have a backup copy of your wallet in another location.

You didn't answer the question.  In order to make something illegal, you certainly have to define the illegal activity.  Preventing the operation of exchanges in the US will only prevent the United States' financial sector from profiting off of bitcoins.
What you are much more likely to see are a set of regulations that ensures that Wall Street and only Wall Street can control the bitcoin market in the US.

There's no perfect example.  Good governance requires constant vigilance from the people who must fight to make their government accountable.  Are you really trying to argue that an anarchy would work out better for everyone in the long run?
