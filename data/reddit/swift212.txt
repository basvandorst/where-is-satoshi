This is an absolute game changer and will definitely lead to a Bitcoin bull rally once successfully launched. This will introduce a base that's skeptical about joining the crypto space through untrustworthy unregulated brokers. I'll be interested to know how they will prepare to deal with the oncoming traffic issues like the ones that coinbase deals with on the regular..

They make money through margin accounts. instead of charging you a percentage based fee they charge you a flat fee based on the different amounts. I believe they also make money off the spread.

I've tried looking for confirmation on this. Do you mind pointing me to a link?
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:00:27
I think the high transaction fees and slow transaction speed should be your main cause for a bearish view. It's impossible to trade btc when bitcoin is in a bull rally. If your going to trade, now might be your best time as the market has settled quite a bit these last few days. you can attribute that to the first 2 points I've made.
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:54:22
From my experience credit goes through instantly and you get your btc right away

I transferred to gdax from my blockchain wallet without a problem albeit it took about an hour to hit my account. I knew it would take that long so I wasn't worried but 4 days seem like a long time.
Have you checked your transaction on coinbase.com? you should see the pending deposit listed on there
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:26:46
For some reason when I tried to transfer btc to binance it took almost 10 hours. Idk maybe there was a lot of traffic but that definietly scared me to the point like everyone else when it comes to sending coins out, we just exchange btc for eth or ltc and move it.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:50:33
if your comfortable with sharing you SS number and such, there are plenty of options. Gemini, Poloniex, etc. Bittrex requires I think the last 4 of your sosh but all other exchanges have a pretty strict verification processes. I don't like giving out my ss to anyone or any site so all of those are no go's for me. It's best if you buy eth or ltc in coinbase(or GDAX) and transfer them to binance for alt coins.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:43:39
Thanks for the recommendation. I'm not so much interested in going from Fiat to crypto rather then crypto to crypto. I just like having options so I'll definitely check it out.

I've bought mine from amazon and have had no problems. There are instructions on how to verify if the nano has been tampered with if you want to feel more secure. From what I read directly from ledger, the boxes do not come in a tamper proof enclosure at all. If you can even go through the process of setting up your nano and resetting to create a new key if you'd like. These are the same concerns I had before buying so I know where your coming from. Hope this helps!

Was there information release on trading these pairs?
@_date: 2018-06-26 22:41:05
I didn’t see anything about BCH. You might know something I don’t..
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:40:24
I'm not sure I've heard of a selling low to buy high strategy but yea in GDAX you are battling an extremely volatile market which means most likely bots will be apart of the equation no matter what. If it means anything though, all I do is manual limit orders and have been getting most of my orders filled. Their have been times I missed out on my strike points but thats the cost to play the BTC trading game. I'd recommend trading ether or LTC to allow yourself to get used to the interface at a slower speed. If I where you as a new comer, I would buy and hold on GDAX where ever you can fit in. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:33:59
I use gdax which is coinbase's trading platform. You can login to gdax using your coinbase credentials as they are ran by the same company. I recommend you transfer your balance to gdax so that you can buy in at lower fees if your looking to buy at market value or you can save on fees completely by creating a limit order.
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:19:10
Congrats! I hope so too. That's reason for my questioning and research. I do it to ensure that's a possibility and if I feel it's not, I'll move my positions accordingly.
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:58:15
You left the part out about gold being tangible and can actually be used whereas bitcoin can not. There's nothing guaranteed about bitcoin. For all we know an alt coin can end up taking over the crypto market in the future. While I personally do think it is a great investment opportunity, I won't be naive to think I can predict the future. People are forgetting that at this point Bitcoin's price is based on 100% speculation.
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:28:17
Lol hey man I'm in it to win it like everyone else. I'm invested in Bitcoin and want to see it flourish just like you do my friend but some people leave some details out that might be helpful for someone who needs to understand the term "only invest what you are willing to lose". I'm sure you've heard that line a few times
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:17:26
Well put and my sentiments exactly! I'm still relatively new to the technology but from an investment standpoint, it's hard to get around the fact that it is all speculative although I think it has the potential to push further. From what I read, nothing indicates that the community is making steps towards actually using the btc. Everyone wants to hodl with no information other then the fact the price is increasing. It's a recipe for people to get taken advantage of.
@_date: 2017-11-21 10:20:40
No but I hear they're spearheading the way for a real life bitcoin community. I think there will be a tipping point were US vendors will catch on but the question is when and what will be the cause?
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:50:44
If you're in the us coinbase would be a good place to start. If you develop more interest in crypto then maybe a secondary account with poloniex or bittrex might help to buy your other alt coins.
There's also a pretty good sticky on this forum that gives you just about all you need to know to get started.
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:27:15
I'd recommend practicing with low amounts to get used to whatever interface and broker your using. You need to learn to recognize support and resistance. This sub is full of nothing but hodlers which is not a bad thing, but you won't get much useful trading advice here.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:25:32
Looks interesting. How long does a deposit usually take?
@_date: 2017-11-21 10:13:22
I've been advocating for more adoption but the Hodlers attack when I mention this with regards to my view of bitcoin long term. In my opinion, It will not reach the price most would like if it does not become more of a normal way of exchanging funds. Hopefully the scaling issues get resolved to allow the platform for this but for now we'll just keep watching and hoping for the best.
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:46:57
Both companies pictured above brought tangible products and services while Bitcoin is 100% speculation. This is why most refer to the current market as a bubble.

Hey thanks for the link! I'll be sure to look through there. I didn't quite take this sub as being one for Fundamental concepts or strictly news being that there is so much price talk, speculation and LOTS and LOTS of memes. Lol. Thanks bud.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:24:11
I just posed this question a few minutes ago. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:54:43
Yes, they are a few businesses accepting and processing transactions using Bitcoin. No, you can't live off Bitcoin. Were there companies accepting Bitcoin when it first launched? No. Then why would anyone in their right mind buy something that can't be used? Because of its potential.  Will the price of bitcoin be fueled by speculation forever? I'd like to think not. Look, the fact that most people are emotionally attached to bitcoin is further proof that the people are investing because they believe in it and so do I but I gotta call a spade a spade.
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:23:26
Yea, I 100% agree with you that it's like nothing we've ever seen for sure. Bitcoin is breaking all the rules and that's really the kinda scary part. I don't believe that bitcoins in a bubble but there will surely be some pretty deep corrections coming at certain price points. I also think that after each correction Bitcoin will bounce back. If devs can work on the scaling issue then it should continue to rise if not, then idk..
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:59:27
I'm not sure this will be the case in the US but I would agree in saying that it will be a big part of our future, for sure.
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:21:55
How did he get screwed? I think maybe he missed out on buying because of the deposit delay but I wouldn’t call it getting screwed as in that case, he didn’t actually lose on anything but an opportunity. hindsights 20/20 with trading any asset. People always think they know when the market will go up or down but no one knew the plunge was going to stop at 5500. 
With regards to your question, If you have money in your GDAX acct or your coinbase wallet, you are good to trade and buy whenever ready. Now… here we may have found a Con with GDAX when compared to Coinbase. 
GDAX deposits do take a while to hit and you cannot trade until you actually have money that has been cleared on your account. Coinbase on the other hand allows you to buy BTC at the current market value using your linked bank acct with no money in your coinbase wallet. Now there is still a clearing process which needs to take place in order for you to get your BTC which takes about the length of time it takes for your GDAX deposit to hit your account.  The good thing though is that the BTC will be credited at the price it was when you initiated the trade.  So the big difference is you can buy on coinbase with your linked bank acct whereas you can’t buy anything until funds are cleared on your account with GDAX.
Hope that helps
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:59:25
Yea, once the funds have cleared its off to the races. you can place an order immediately after. If you want to place an order for $100 worth of Bitcoin and you submit the order, that is what you'll instantly get. What will differ is the qty of Bitcoin as the price moves while your in the middle of placing your request (if that makes sense.)
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:11:10
This has actually happened to me recently when it went from 7400 to 7600 in 17 minutes yesterday around noon. It's definitely risky as all trades are but I think there is some money to be made. It shows by the volatility of the market. I managed to make some good trades since then but the surge in price out of nowhere and market manipulation are definitely a factor.
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:42:12
I may need to clarify in saying overtaking fiat not actually replacing it from a literal stand point. I'm not sure if you have any btc but in order for btc to increase to what hodlers are hoping for, there needs to be an increase in adoption. Value is created with supply and demand and if everyone just hodls and there  no demand from outside the community then what exactly is going to make btc valuable? 
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:35:18
Yea if I could edit my title I would (or at least I don't know how to) but my question is more or less will btc overtake fiat as an alternative because of its anticipated popularity. I think aside from scaling, regulation will be the next hurdle in the crypto takeover as Uncle Sam will start feeling left out.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:04:45

If the tech continues to evolve to support or deal with the larger blockchains then the potential is there to reach those type of numbers in 10 to 20 years. Personally I would like to see some stability within the next 3 years.
@_date: 2017-11-21 10:14:23
In your opinion, when do you think we'll get to a point of stabilization?
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:40:39
I've personally never admitted to calling it a bubble. I personally don't believe it is however, we are valuing bitcoin based on its potential (well not we literally) but the market is, are we not? We know that it has the potential to bring change to the little village in Africa and also get the government out of our business but what brings true value to the tech? The speculation that it will once be adopted by many and become more of the normal way to exchange funds.  At that point the price of Bitcoin would skyrocket so high we'd break our necks trying to keep up but at the end of the day it is what it is. I think it has great potential barring the scaling issues but there are no guarantees is all I'm saying though just like you, I hope it goes to the moon.
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:20:48
What is your take away on institutional investors jumping in? 
I think they see a way to manipulate the markets and make free money with the power they have.
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:00:58
In my opinion, the coinbase site is much more user and newbie friendly whereas gdax is more for advanced users/traders.
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:00:32
Do you mean Bitcoin won't exist literally? How did you come to that conclusion and what do you think will push people to use a crypto that is centralized through a corporation?
It's interesting perspective none the less
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:15:02
No one is selling or buying shares (or parts) of the Internet.    The Internet is actually a great example when comparing the value of non tangible technology(if you will) because the tech itself is worth nothing until someone puts good use to it. While I do agree the technology created through Bitcoin and crypto will change the way we live, I can't say that I believe bitcoin will be the always and forever of crypto. There will be growing pains and the number one factor that will surely add to the guarantee of nothing is humans.
To your point of hard money and bubbles. Hard money and Bitcoin can not be compared. One is backed by government,military, and economies the other is backed by a community who mostly sees it as an investment opportunity and by some who believe in the tech.

This is primarily why I subscribed to the Sub but unfortunately I have not seen much of it..
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:28:43
I had a trigger set closer to 8k but never made it before the dip so i lost out on some profit. Good job on the trade. I know alot of people are intimidated by trading but it can work out if you limit your risk and make sound decisions. I'll probably start selling again once get closer or over to 8k. I think that's when the hodlers will come back out to play again.
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:47:56
I agree in that money from outside of the community needs to come in but outside of few investment groups, usage at the the consume level needs to occur at a higher rate for your average joe to come in and buy btc and that's when the real money is going to pump in, in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:04:37
It makes sense from your standpoint. I can appreciate differences in opinion. As an investor though, that does not bring much value to the crypto nor will it fulfill from what I understand or believe to be the reason btc was created.
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:19:27
I think it will happen but there needs to be a trigger. I'm not sure the trigger well be price moving up to a certain point. 
I'm curious to know, do you invest in btc?
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:31:59
I think because of its popularity it would need to be for the average person to get involved. I prefer litecoin over vertcoin. From what I have seen vertcoin is almost a copy of litecoin. With that being said I think if Bitcoin fails, they all will and then one will rise from the ashes to take control.  I like eth too.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:29:30
I see they host lots of different crypto's. What is it that you like most about Binance over other exchanges?
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:24:29
Risk of not filling an order only occurs with limit orders which is also the reason most traders use GDAX. The con would be that you are battling bots if you are manually trading limit and stop orders. If you are placing a market order you will instantly buy at market rate through both Coinbase and GDAX (which btw is ran by the same company) however, GDAX allows you to trade at a much lower rate. In sum, the coinbase interface is available for newcomers who only know how to place market orders. GDAX is for more advanced users who know how to trade.
