Wouldn't it be 5.1*1174/7500?
@_date: 2017-02-26 14:39:46


Got a source for that? 
@_date: 2017-02-26 18:31:49
You are correct, thanks.
@_date: 2017-02-10 12:27:24
And I'll go on a limb and say they're designed for more than 2 tx / sec and / or have bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-02-10 20:58:26
You are correct, my mining %s were wrong. I misremembered Hearn's statements on his blog: 
"**Why has the capacity limit not been raised?** Because the block chain is controlled by Chinese miners, just two of whom control more than 50% of the hash power. At a recent conference over 95% of hashing power was controlled by a handful of guys sitting on a single stage. The miners are not allowing the block chain to grow."
And I brought up segwit. If segwit takes fees away from miners, they won't switch. Simple as that. You end up with a cryptocurrency that cannot be used as a currency and is only useful as speculative store of value.

I received your pm, but I hope you see that the fact that we had to keep it to ourselves *is a problem*. Why is asking simple questions not allowed here? 
@_date: 2017-02-26 22:07:17
I'm having trouble reading your chart... you state that 


But the chart says 70 GB / month bandwidth for the current blocks?
Sweet chart btw! But we should keep in mind that 4 TBs won't fill half a USB drive in 2023, and that gigabite fiber connections (google fiber and their att competition) will be more common by then.

Good luck designing a sustainable system like that. And yes, before you go into a dumb argument, btc used to have sub penny fees and other alts still do have sub penny fees.
@_date: 2017-02-26 14:08:52
I'm having four different conversations with four different people, it has nothing to do with manners. And if you read carefully, you'll see that none of those arguments that "refuted what I said" actually answered my question: What do Blockstream investors get out of it?
Also just saying that "it is not censorship because the other side is propaganda" is not enough for me, sorry.
@_date: 2017-02-06 20:52:07
Are we supposed to like high fees?
@_date: 2017-02-26 13:47:13
We are not allowed to link to posts in the other bitcoin subreddit to back up any argument. That should be an example of 
@_date: 2017-02-26 13:01:10


I would have an open conversation with the community, even about the controversial topics, such as *who funded the 70+ million USD for Blockstream* (which hired most of the core Bitcoin devs), and *what do those who funded Blockstream will get out of that deal*. Those of us who have lived long enough know that these topics matter, and we will keep bringing it up even if we are mocked for bringing it up or asking. Please note that instead of answers we get insults.


ViaBTC wants Bitcoin to keep being what bitcoin was: a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. Just two days ago there were 100,000 unconfirmed transactions, with an average fee of *$1.73* per transaction. Most transactions took over 12 hours to clear.
That is not cash, it is not healthy to the system - as it drives users away - and it is ridiculous, since we still have 1 MB blocks in 2017, when we can handle *a lot* more due to improved modern technology.
**Edit 1:**
Ten replies later and the question is still unanswered. What do the Blockstream investors (lead investor was AXA, its CEO (Henri de Castries) is the Bilderberg chairman) get out of it? So far, the summarized replies have been:

Reasonable fee is less than a penny.

Math is lies, got it.
@_date: 2017-02-26 14:06:12




Sorry, but no company becomes rich by giving away money and not expecting something in return. And no, "staying informed" is not what they invested millions of dollars on, or they would just have hired Blockstream as consultants.
@_date: 2017-02-10 18:39:58


You should invest in Myspace stock then. Because Myspace was first. So its better. Because logic.


This is fine. The fact that bitcoin, a *cryptocurrency* cannot be used as a *currency* is fine. Logic.


Very logical.
@_date: 2017-02-10 18:24:43
90% to 95% of Bitcoin's mining power is controlled by two Chinese persons. That is why Bitcoin will have a *tough* time implementing segwit.
@_date: 2017-02-26 13:11:12
I just had a long, well written, non offensive post deleted in this thread. I'll pm it to you.

What a dumb conspiracy theory.
@_date: 2017-02-10 18:29:18
Bitcoin before: 10 minute transactions, sub penny fees.
Bitcoin now: hour to days transactions, half dollar to dollar fees.
But I agree with you, surely if people complain they must be shills with vote bots.
@_date: 2017-02-26 15:11:18
Asking questions is shit-slinging, concern troll, completely ludicrous, temporary bannable to you, blatant propaganda, and very absurd.
Did I miss anything? Seems like I asked a sensitive question lol.
@_date: 2017-02-26 13:57:46


Was that your insightful response to my questions? You poor soul. Run along now.
@_date: 2017-02-26 13:39:25
Things have calmed down a bit more, but just take Total Fees (5.1 BTC), multiply that by bitcoin's price (1174), and divide that by the amount of unconfirmed transactions (7500). 
Current average fee paid is 0.80 USD.
I'd also argue that $0.4 for a transaction is already a failure.
@_date: 2017-02-09 17:20:30
Yeah Eth didn't get hit as hard.
@_date: 2017-02-26 18:40:38
I know where you're going - centralization vs. transactions / second - and I know it is more complicated than people think. However I also know that we can do more than 1 MB / block. Some say we can do 4 Mb blocks now, some say we can do 8 Mb. Whatever that number is, it is higher than the puny 1 MB. 
Please note that I'm not talking about BU or SegWit there, only a simple block size increase.
And since you asked, 1 penny per transactions is in my comfort level. 
(And you're right, my calculation was wrong and has been edited now).

Dao smart contract code being bugged does not mean Ethereums code is bugged.
@_date: 2017-02-10 18:01:43
Sort of reminds me of the fact that BTC is now useless as a currency with fees at .5 to 1 USD and transaction times in the day(s) range.
All its value atm comes from speculation.

Alright then, but if you want to compare Eths tx / day to Btcs tx / day then compare them when they were both 2 or 3 years old. See where that gets you.
And my previous response was not a tangent - nobody is able to use bitcoin as a currency anymore. 
And notice how almost 3/4 of the content in your responses are personal attacks at a person you don't even know. What do you think that say about you?
@_date: 2017-02-26 14:44:57
You totally got me there, attaboy!
@_date: 2017-02-26 23:10:14
Yeah, that number was due to me failing my math, this morning's average fee was .80 USD, not 1.73.
Still too high on my opinion.
@_date: 2017-02-26 14:44:08
If they were so generous and charitable as they desperately want the public to see them, then they'd donate. Instead, they invested, which makes a world of difference. Since they invested, we are free to ask: what do they get out of it? And no, I have still not seen the answer in this thread.
@_date: 2017-02-26 14:30:53
My fallback position, due to having real world experience raising VC, is that investors want and will get something out of their investment. If that is what you call a conspiracy then you might need help.
@_date: 2017-02-10 19:01:02


I'm still waiting for you to take a look.


Are you seriously trying to argue that bitcoin is not a cryptocurrency? Hilariously logical of you.


Take it as personal advice, since you're so focused in personal growth. Serious people look down on those who get so... emotional over internet discussions. I'd be very ashamed if those around me realized that this is how I treat strangers with different opinions.

Try buying small amounts every x days instead of all at once if you choose to go in again. It lowers your exposure to the wild price swings in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-26 13:16:01
I literally just had a civil post deleted on this thread for asking the wrong questions. 
@_date: 2017-02-26 18:56:40
Because I handle substantial amounts of money, and I need to know in what direction bitcoin is headed before I make further moves, which means that question dodging and half answers are not enough.
In other words, I need to be informed, and so should others.
@_date: 2017-02-23 12:06:42
Wait why would BU spam the blockchain?
@_date: 2017-02-10 18:40:46

Meanwhile other cryptos have transaction fees in the half penny range, with 10 to 20 second block times.

Please show me where it is proven that I cannot understand the answer? In fact, please prove that I have *even asked* this question before this thread.

Bitcoin was supposed to be better than credit and debit cards.
How far we have fallen.

Good point. Do you know? (serious question, I'm actually curious).
@_date: 2017-02-10 18:26:45
What about 4 or 8 mb? Would that break the network?

My comment was removed, but it has been reinstated. I do believe subreddits can have their own rules to keep discussions civil, but I think acting like there is no politically motivated censoring going on in here is childish.

So those exchanges who signed the hard fork declaration should be banned?
@_date: 2017-03-01 20:34:59
How much would that fee be if we forked to 4 MB blocks? 
(I'm not talking about BU at all here, just a simple fork)

Pretty sure Ethereum already has more nodes than Bitcoin.

See, when I posted that comment it showed up as removed for the first ten minutes, and it had no replies. It is not "jumping to conclusions" to think it was removed. 
Not being able to link to the competing subreddit is pretty damn close to politically motivated censorship, but feel free to think the opposite. 
@_date: 2017-01-28 10:10:54
That was a great selling point of Bitcoin though - zero or tiny transaction fees - regardless of transaction amount.
And what if people don't want lightning? The more I read about Bitcoins current situation the more worried I get. 
@_date: 2017-01-28 08:46:47
So 30 cents per transactions is ok? What happened to this community?
@_date: 2017-01-30 07:45:16
Theres's been a huge debate for months on whether to increase blocksize. Some communities / moderators take it too far and apparently delete and ban people who don't have the right opinion.
@_date: 2017-04-28 08:03:29
Wow, I just realized that the crowdsale investors bought eth at $.25 and now its worth $69.
They got about 275 times their money back. What a scam. What a ripoff.
