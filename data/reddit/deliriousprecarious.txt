You are assuming these companies *want* full decentralization. Quasi-decentralization among a number of authorized network participants is much more in line with what most of these institutions want.

With 700 million dollars you could just take over the mining network yourself. The bitcoin hashrate is something liek 400,000,000 GH/S? And it costs something like 1000 for 2500 GH/S which brings the total cost of the network to (400,000,000/2,500)*1000 or 160 million dollars (assuming you buy everything commercially). Wtih 700 million the guy could just take over the network and double spend the coin into oblivion.

The information presented at sentencing is not held to the same standard as information used for conviction. It's the reason that Ulbircht's mom, for example, can write a letter to the judge saying what an upstanding  Citizen her son is without having to prove such a claim. Similarly the Prosecution can show evidence of bad behavior in this case murder for hire allegations as reasons for harsher sentencing.

That's not really his point though. A property of nationally backed Fiat currencies is that their use as legal tender is enforceable by the legal system which itself is enforced by men with guns. This gives it value. Many other financial assets also have value without having them men with guns. However in those cases the asset provides a significant material benefit to owning it.
Krugman is wrong that there is no material benefit to owning bitcoins. Being able to transact seamlessly on the internet is a benefit, as is quasi-anonymity. However I would venture to say that *that* utility is insufficient to drive "moon" prices.

In what ways is it quicker? A western union transfer takes minutes. It's basically an update in their internal ledger to account for money in and money out. Where BTC would be useful would be in their offloading of surplus currency which they receive a lot of and the acquisition of currencies the pay out in (Pesos etc). Of course to do this with Bitcoin would require you to pay spreads in two directions where as a direct trade between the currency pair would be a lot cheaper.

A single benchmark price is important for the structuring and settling of contracts.

The NYSE wants to be that BTC reference price.

It was also never proven that Ross was a fine upstanding gentleman as alleged by character witnesses at the sentencing. And that's the whole point. At sentencing the facts of the trial are already accounted for, what has and has not been done has been agreed upon by the jury. All this extra stuff is contextual information for the judge to take into account. This can include allegations of greater misconduct or evidence of good character. In neither case does the conduct have to be proven beyond reasonable doubt. 
Just to be clear Ulbricht has only been convicted of Narcotics Conspiracy and his punishment can only follow the guidelines for that crime. However where on the spectrum of punishments his sentence will actually fall is up to the judge and that judge can take into account any information he wants. I'm pretty sure that once you're convicted of a crime the judge can give you max sentence for basically any reason whatsoever.

No. All law.
Here's how this works. When you deposit money in a bank (or Gox) you are not giving over money for safe keeping or anything like that. Instead you are making a callable loan to the bank. The money deposited is now the *banks* asset with an offsetting liability to you. There is no such thing as "your" *money* at that point because what you really have is a loan asset.
So if you deposit (lend) money on Monday, it goes missing on Tuesday, and more people deposit on Wednesday there is no functional difference between the people who deposited on Monday and Wednesday. You are *all* creditors of the bank in equal standing. In the event of bankruptcy you will all be treated the same.
@_date: 2015-08-01 22:30:06
A web sites terms of use doesn't supercede the law. Just because Gox claims it wasn't acting as a bank does not mean that it actually wasn't a bank or that the government cannot/should not treat them as one. That's why the unwinding of the Gox bankruptcy will proceed along the same lines of an actual bank bankruptcy. 
Also Gox absolutely didn't maintain individual bitcoin wallets for all users. Coins were comingled in large cold and hot wallets and used those coins to fill buys on an ad-hoc basis. The entire concept of a hot wallet implies that if I buy coins from you and withdraw them I'm not getting *your* coins as those may very well be locked away in the cold wallet. I'm getting arbitrary coins. So while yes each coin is uniquely identifiable, Gox treated coins as fungible.

Yes. Market makers aren't trading on anyone's behalf. They are trading their own book and seek to make money by providing liquidity and capturing spreads.

The funny thing about your "analysis" is that most of your points are addressed in Episode 3 - which you obviously didn't watch.
1. Elliot *is* unethical in his hacks. That's what makes him interesting. Turning him into some crusading white knight vigilante would, in fact, be boring. EDIT: Boring to the point that if the message of the show *is* anti-corporate, turning the protagonist into some preachy mary-sue version of anonymous might actually work *against* that message.
3. The CTO is framed in Episode 2 and Elliot questions why they are bringing down an "innocent" man. Of course it is later revealed in Episode 3 that the CTO was directly responsible (through profit driven negligence) for the death of Elliot's father. So no the show doesn't give the guy a pass for being just a cog in the machine. It actually takes the notion that he was "just doing his job", put forward in Episode 2, and shatters it by directly linking him to a tragedy suffered by the protagonist. The show is literally setting up apologetic arguments for certain corporate behaviors and then knocking them down. 
4. Elliot doesn't actually have an alternative plan at the end of Episode 2 - he simply refuses to participate unless he can guarantee everyone's safety. This show Elliot to be a "good guy". By the end of Episode 3 (and I have not seen Episode 4) he returns to fsociety with a new plan (unrevealed but all signs point to it being better/safer). To be clear it is heavily implied that Mr. Robot is a Tyler Durden-esque figment of Elliot's imagination which means that the conflict between them is actually an internal conflict where Elliot wants to destroy the backups in Iron Mountain but has not yet figured out how to do so safely.
 


You're describing yourself here. You've watched 20% - not even the entirety of the stories first act - and have decided that you know everything about the messages and motivations of the creator. Your analysis is laughable because your complaints are *directly* addressed in the subsequent episodes.

This assumes you can outhash one of the worlds biggest banks. Right now the current hashrate of the Bitcoin netowrk is ~400,000,000 GH/s or 400,000 TH/s. Currently, you can get retail bitcoin mining hardware (Antminer S5) to put out ~1 TH/s for $500.
This means that using retail technology *only* the cost to replicate the Bitcoin network is on the order 200 million dollars. A single bank would not find it difficult to spend that kind of money on their own hash power. A consortium of banks working together would find it even easier.

That's not a useful definition of premine at all. A altcoin would be considered premined if 10% of all extant coins were mined by the developer before mining was opened to the public. Even if the supply of all future coins is left to regular mining distribution the coin is still a premine. 
I mean this list of "[scamcoins]( is mostly a list of coins in which the mining schedule was set up to provide unnecessarily large rewards to the first blocks as a means of diverting coins into the hands of developers. 
Regardless, my point isn't that Bitcoin is actually premined (though you could easily argue that Bitcoin was 5% premined by Satoshi) - just that from the perspective of anyone getting into crypto there is no difference between a bunch of banks distributed the first 15 million coins among themselves and a bunch of Bitcoiners distributing the first 15 million coins among themselves.

I think your estimate is probably a little high. To extrapolate to a global scale let's use the estimated global GDP which, in 2012, was 73.48 trillion U.S. dollars. Just divide that by the number of minutes in a year and multiply by 250 to get the average cost of losing 250 minutes of economic activity.
[73.48T / (365\*24\*60)] * 250 = ~35billion dollars.

You're missing the point Eric. It's not a matter of not wanting to make others rich. It's about caring *who* you make rich. Saying that Bitcoin will be superior to some "bank coin" on the basis of "premine" is stupid because from the perspective of those getting involved the economic reality of buying into an already owned commodity is the same - regardless of who the existing owners are.
Bitcoin can be better than a bank coin for all manner of other reasons, but the premine argument isn't going to be especially convincing for mass adopters.

Bitcoin is an interesting economic and technical innovation and that means it leads to lots of interesting discussions. You can ultimately think that BTC is going to fail (depending on how you define fail) while still thinking it's interesting enough to talk about.
As for the trolling, sometimes the breathless "speeches" people post in this sub are too good *not* to make fun of.

Bitcoin in its current form cannot support widespread micro transactions. The system simply cannot process enough Tx per second to make that feasible.

Not really. They aren't collecting a performance fee. Just a flat rate for assets under management. $50 million at $100/BTC or $200/BTC is completely irrelevant to them. Without a performance fee they cannot line their pockets by manipulating the price down.

Then you aren't looking very hard. Zerohedge has a very lenient content policy which makes it a haven for alarmist theories. That doesn't mean everything on the site is garbage...just that there *is* garbage on the site.


Anyone who listened to Zerohedge three years ago in the U.S. missed out on a massive bull market and would have ensured that their investments never recovered from the post crisis lows.

I don't keep my long term savings in cash and don't see why why keeping my excess production (savings) in a medium of exchange is better for an economy than putting those same savings towards a productive asset i.e.: an investment. Since inflation measures the purchasing power of the dollar the dollar denominated value of those assets scales appropriately.

It's not. The Ban of England has clearly come out and said that central bank lending is loose enough that the true barrier to the money supply is only the demand for credit. It's why the Australians don't even have a reserve requirement.

First, figure out how much money you have to work with. Then, investigate all the available ASICs that are out there (making sure to avoid companies with bad reputations). Then determine how much electricity costs in your area and estimate what your daily return will be over time.
The final step is to give up and realize that unless you are manufacturing the chips yourself (or have an inside connection to buy said chips at extremely below market prices) that you are much better off not mining in the first place.

Not quite. If your friend refuses to pay and you take them to court and the *court* orders him to recompense you in dollars - that is legal. However the court is within it's rights to force him to repay you in the originally agreed upon manner. 
For example if you contract with an art dealer to buy a one of a kind Picasso painting you are creating a debt where he owes you that painting. If he refuses to uphold his end of the contract the court can just order him to hand over the painting (and not just return your money).


Most futures contracts explicitly state that the contract can be settled via physical delivery or cash.

This is exactly the reason why debt creates money. If I lend you money I still think it's mine. But if the money is in your account you think it's yours. In very basic terms I've "created" money by lending it to you.

[This doesn't work]( If you aggressively short bitcoin, the entity maintaining the peg will eventually capitulate when they run out of money. This causes the price to crash which nets the short a lot of profit.

Well that would entirely depend on what you wanted to do with them. 


Well it seems like they have no problem bullying/hacking DNM's without a 300 million dollar slush fund so I'm not really sure what the point of this money would be.
The truth is either that Jones is bullshitting and this is all bogus or it actually is some greedy fuck who wants the coins. If the FBI needed money to "hack" DNMs it would be entirely within the scope of their *normal* operations to do so. It's not like hacking a DNM is in any way similar to funding the Contras.

Exactly. There isn't enough liquidity to actually make that BTC useful.
@_date: 2015-04-28 16:02:57
The average alt-coin fails because it provides no utility beyond what Bitcoin provides. If you had an "alt coin type technology" (not necessarily a true alt coin) with true institutional support you could immediately vault the technology to a lot of users by leveraging the legacy financial system they are already a part of. 
IMO that's the next major issue that BTC faces.

The existence of the AIIB is hardly evidence that the world is turning its back on the U.S. given that it is not just a competitor to the traditionally US led world bank but also a competitor of the IMF - which is European led.
The AIIB is simply evidence that Asia/Middle East/Eastern Europe are coming into their own as global powers.

It's more nuanced then that. In countries with a reserve requirement FRB still holds in aggregate. However central bank lending, to make compensate for reserve shortfalls is loose enough that the *real* barrier for the money supply ends up being the demand for credit.

They can accurately describe the risk profile of your portfolio to you.

I'm saying that if willybot is real then a responsible investor is going to stay on the sidelines completely because the system isn't worth getting involved in.
