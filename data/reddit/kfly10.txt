I have a follow up question as I’ve been looking into wallets as well lately and have confusion regarding the private keys. 
If you don’t own your keys, you don’t own your bitcoin. Got it. The private keys seem important. Is the seed / recovery seed the private key? Or are they different things. And the possibility of losing this seed and therefor my bitcoin stresses me out. What do people typically do with their seeds? Safety deposit box? Write in a note on a phone? Save on a piece of paper in nightstand? I know that sounds silly but generally curious to hear what others do. 
And what happens if these hardware wallets break / die. How would you access the bitcoin?

Thank you very much! This definitely eases many of my concerns..
I know the Trezor and Nano S are kind of the leaders. But I’m very intrigued by the Cool Wallet S. Any thoughts / recommendations?

Very good points. While I think the Cool Wallet is 100x “cooler” than the others and would love seeing it in my wallet or nightstand or wherever, when it comes to safely and securely storing an investment like this how the product looks can’t be a top priority. 
Appreciate the feedback brotha!

Appreciate the insight and if you do learn more about the Cool Wallet S and have an opinion I’d love to hear it! From my research it seems to be solidly legit and has some crossover appeal between hot and cold storage
