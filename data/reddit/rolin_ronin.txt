@_date: 2017-11-10 16:54:37
Lol are you a joke, please explain how it is a scam xd
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:29:50
So is your comment, i dont see you adding anything constructive
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:42:43
why do you consider it an attack though, i just like it better and beleive in bch, yall are allowed to forcefuly beleive in bitcoin, and thats ok with me, reciprocate the respect
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:10:45
So much false info right here, inform yourself will you then speak
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:36:41
i did and i doubled my money in the last 2 weeks
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:44:03
Well my rebutal should be this and that is why bch is better. You can infor m yourself instead of spreading false info and then comment on something you now know. Im not gonna write you a thesis in the comments boi
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:08:55
this guy gets it
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:23:17
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:45:12

@_date: 2017-11-10 21:16:10
look im simplifying mate
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:22:03
No it did not
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:25:04
No inovation lol, i could say that about bitcoin.
Your argument is invalid
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:11:02
look i didn't intend to write a thesis i'm just making an observation dude
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:36:04
why do you try and dehumanize me, i aint no shill im just a regular guy who has a part time job who goes to school who like fast food from time to time, you guys really like the us vs them mentality dont you.
Disagreeing aint shilling, you have your opinion and i respect that, try and reciprocate that respect for once
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:51:17
Yes you are right on one point, but my point is changing to 8mb blocks is at least some inovation, bitcoin hasnt had any innovation or change and that isnt how it should be, it should change and adapt. The one changing and adapting is bch. Hence the true bitcoin is bitcoin cash
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:08:43
Now lets see if this gets downvoted to hell it'll prove my point
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:09:20
thank you for proving my point
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:35:42
no hard feelings, have a good day sir! and best of luck in your crypto investments as well.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:52:03
It upgraded its block size, now tell me. What is innovative about bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:10:05
my bitcoin cash has tripled in value in the last week, good luck with your crashing btc
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:38:28
well thankyou stinky hobo
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:07:33
You should buy bitcoin cash
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:11:50
Wtf are you talking about i answered the question
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:55:22
Ya your bitcoin will crash bch will win in the long run
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:14:08
ye but im not shiting on everything man chill out
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:08:43
how can you stand behind bitcoin and call bch a altcoin, it stems from the same origin, has the same blockchain and its only difference is the block size, yet you call it an altcoin, are you that stubborn
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:03:40
will you join us now
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:27:28
Nooooo bcash is not bitcoin cash
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:28:49
And bitcoin cash is exactly what you said with the additional 8mb blocks, it isint that much off a different coin you dunce its from the same blockchain
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:07:48
Bitcoin cash
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:08:16
Because we cant factually exain bitcoin cash and stand behind it without being called a shill, and scamcoin, an alt coin, as well as just plenty of nasty insults. Just because we stand behind bitcoin cash. I hope btc falls in the next week well suck up all that value and stick it right in bitcoin cash thank you very much
@_date: 2017-07-30 05:43:06
Yes
