Bitfinex enabled segwit around same time as CoinBase.
@_date: 2017-03-26 09:54:47
F2Pool seems quite reasonable and already started testing new Debian OS, which they previously said is blocker for new client adoption.
Actually I started to believe that F2Pool will enventually signal for SegWit to balance the power and help finding the compromise. This makes best sense from their point of view.

slush: any ETA on implementing 0.12.1?
@_date: 2016-06-08 12:27:29
Slush just reported that he has finished deploying 0.12.1. He says it may take some (small) time to take effect.
@_date: 2016-06-08 15:03:55
BIP9 allows multiple softforks to be activated simultaneously. 0.12.1 contains three BIPs softforks, which will upgrade btc greatly and in future allow smart contracts, segwit, lightning network and other cool stuff.
@_date: 2016-06-08 14:03:37
Thats true, but he has already stated CSV deployment is finished and some brief time will be needed before version bits will be refreshed.
@_date: 2016-06-07 09:07:55
Cool! And Slush reported yesterday that he is currently working on implementing 0.12.1...
@_date: 2016-06-08 12:26:21
Yeah, but at least one of todays (415340) is from the same stratum that did not signal yesterday.. so smth has changed :-)
@_date: 2016-06-08 09:27:07
Yes, 0.12.1
@_date: 2016-06-09 06:40:43
Its a node thing as well. Do upgrade :-)

Good job Core!
@_date: 2016-12-04 17:22:30
Thanks for your opinion. However I dont agree with your assessment, Core DEV are doing excellent job.
@_date: 2016-12-04 12:10:01
Luke, would you please provide more detail on this 2 MB "no wallet changes necessary" hardfork? E.g. is it based on any published BIP? Is it static 2MB hardfork, would consequent limit bump be possible with just softforks etc.? Thanks. 
@_date: 2016-11-06 20:25:12
i believe its first diff retarget after 15 November
@_date: 2016-12-04 18:33:32
I got confused by "No wallet changes necessary". I though with HF everyone (miners, nodes, wallets) needs to upgrade.
@_date: 2016-11-18 09:39:02
Dont worry, it takes time to upgrade all infrastructure. Last BIP9 softfork CSV took 2-3 months.
@_date: 2017-08-27 11:41:59
Is this software seriously intended to replace current devs? Or am I missing smth and development is being done somewhere else on github or privately (disaster)?
@_date: 2016-12-04 15:38:00
Im confused now. Is this proposal HF or not? Because thread topic says 2MB HF.
@_date: 2016-11-06 20:06:38
No we dont. coin.dance just derives that from coinbase text, which says nothing about activation progress. The real signalling will start around Nov 19.
@_date: 2016-12-05 08:30:13
Luke, thanks for making this clear and good luck! Im ofcourse curious what is the ETA for this and what are the plans for proposing this HF to community. Mostly if its a realistic plan how to gain wide consensus with miners. But Ill be fine if you skip the answer :-)
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:14:00
What is Greg trying to say?
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:54:46
I know and I have same thoughts as you. It would just be briliant, if he finally leave... even if price should tank temporarily.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:57:59
LOL, even my wife laughted out loud :-)))
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:04:40
BCH is just trying to solve complex and difficult problem with easy solution. From my life experience, these approaches usually dont work.
Increasing block frequency is the same thing, maybe even worse. Block propagation via network and validation takes resources and time.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:01:46
Centralization on 2nd+ layer may be higher than on the 1st layer, thats true. But its an optional tradeoff for superfast confirmation and cheap tx fees. Buying coffee scenario. And there might be additional mechanisms to make it more private.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:57:34
Hm, tracked some boosted txs and there are from at least three different miners.
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:06:39
Validating one milion txs would take more than a "small fraction" of lag. ECDSA validation consumes lots of resources. Long propagation times lead to network splits and other problems.
Quantities you speak about are not possible on consumer hardware in forseeable future while keeping network decentralized.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:13:16
Lol, Roger got triggered by BCash :-)) He really feels insecure about this one...
@_date: 2017-11-23 06:56:57
So now we (probably) have second competitor to Bitmain! If Japaneese GMO joins the club too, we will have three competitors! Hopefully these wont be scam. If its real then we may have Roger going to BCash and Jihan out of business :-)
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:32:22
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:02:04
yeah, NYA = btc1 client
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:30:48
This is strongly overestimating power of certain individuals to tank the price of bitcoin to zero. Yes, deep drop may happen, but dont mix it with destroying bitcoin. There are already many non-technical investors in positions and wanting more, they dont even know BCH exists. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:29:53
Good bye Roger, we will NOT miss you!
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:40:45
Certainly, good question. If they would allow 256k txs per second to be stored on 1st layer (blockchain), it means these txs need to be stored, transmitted and managed somewhere. In such quantities we are speaking of data centers with many terabytes disks and many servers to handle the load. This would be achievable only by big corporations (thats why I used comparision to card providers). Certainly it will not be Bitcoin network as we know it today, system distributed among thousands and thousands of individuals and businesses.
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:04:45
Would be hilarious if BCash DAA is broken again. Considering the "extensive" testing they gave it, its likely.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:33:21
We have to wait till 0.15.2 for that. 0.15.1 was reprioritized due to the threatening fork.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:11:16
Thanks. So they should adjust diff in next 12 hours or so.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:44:41
Finally!!! Lets celebrate!!! From decency I have to thank our opponents that they called it off.
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:07:33
Mycelium does not support SegWit yet :-(
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:01:56
[BIP8]( may be used for that.
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:33:57
I like using Bittrex, but they didnt provide me any ETA for implementing SegWit for their wallet... :( If your their customer, dont hesitate to request it too.
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:21:44
But this actually prooves my point, 11k per sec is 90secs for 1mil txs. Thats way too much. In reality, the number of operations needed for validation is even higher. Also mining on headers leads to mining empty blocks thus making network unsuable. How would such network deal with spam attacks? LN is better for scaling, it will be less centralized than big data centers in solution you propose.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:25:56
How exactly did Ver get rich before entering BTC? I know he spent some time in prison, what other illegalities he might have been involved in?
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:47:23
Binaries here: 
Check signatures!
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:45:05
BCash does not have engineers to develop solution to such complex problem. Its likely that such scaling on 1st layer would lead to heavily centralized system like VISA or Mastercard. And why build such systems, we have them already.
My trust is in Core and 2nd+ layer solutions. They have developers, they have skill and they come with ideas. BCash mostly copy.
@_date: 2017-11-08 09:53:09
The release of final 0.15.1 binary will be very tight in terms of coming split. I may go with RC if necessary.
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:56:08
Seems like, its still adjusting...
It is currently 18.8% more profitable to mine on the original chain.
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:54:35
25seconds to send 312MB to just next node. Propagate it to the whole network may take up to minutes. And this is only network bandwith we are talking about! CPU block validation would take a lot of time as well. Not to mention storage capacity - growing 45GB a day. How would new nodes join the network and do initial blocks download? TL;DR BCH visions are nonsense.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:37:54
Finally!!! Lets celebrate!!! From decency I have to thank our opponents that they called it off.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:11:55
Exactly. Many top improvements from Core (e.g. MAST) will be build using the witness program. So BCash will be able to come only with simple solutions. From my experience, simple solutions do not usually work on complex problems.
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:23:58
ofcoz not, the guy asked "NYA mean support for btc1", NYA is proclamation to support btc1, bust most miners are running core in fact
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:08:10
Bobby's answers in recent AMA are very disappointing for me. I always took him as Core supporter and in search for gentleman way out of (broken) NYA agreement he signed for. Now he prooves he is on the populists side :-( Very sad. At least he has a brother that speaks sense.

I hate the guy that runs Bitmain for how he is hurting Bitcoin. But what else can I do? I want to help. This is my dilema :-( Id like to support SegWig on LTC, but for that I need to buy miner from him.

@_date: 2017-04-15 15:14:10
In my opinion this is F2Pool reaction on GM's post: [bitcoin-dev] I do not support the BIP 148 UASF
@_date: 2017-04-24 05:25:20
The market already anticipates segwit lockin and activation. ViaLTC knows they lost the game and already promised to signal for LTC SW two days ago.
@_date: 2017-04-22 16:59:29
Not BTC, I mine LTC.
@_date: 2017-04-20 21:07:11

@_date: 2018-02-28 13:54:54
For once I may not upgrade and keep my node on 0.15.1, 0.16 is mostly about wallet. Will go to 0.16.1 - hopefully with MAST softfork.

Ok, Thanks.
@_date: 2017-09-10 16:37:01
There is one more thing I dont understand in segwit.. if your willing to advice even further.. :-)
Segwit output is 'anybody can spend' for legacy nodes. But is that entirely true? I mean the scriptPubKey does not require signature, but it still requires the original form of pubkey, which is really not easy to get. Thanks.
HASH160 PUSHDATA(20)[7e7913e7c0f77f33c44b4dc15dea8ec6adbd5bb3] EQUAL
@_date: 2017-09-24 18:47:51
Agreed. Hope this will eventually diminish when more SegWit tx are in the mempool.
@_date: 2017-09-11 06:00:47
Thank you, "copy scenario" was my missing piece in the puzzle.
@_date: 2017-09-10 16:25:32
Wow! Thanks a lot of such detailed explanation! Combining other sources and my bitcoin-cli I got it :-)
@_date: 2017-09-19 11:46:49
No, it wont. Other countries may have higher el. cost, labour force and respect patents (e.g. dont use ASICBOOST).
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:04:09
It seems like somebody is consolidating or testing bech32. There are many txs where one output is bech32 and the other non-segwit P2PKH (e.g. [here](

Agree on what you said, only the setting is not blocksize, it is blockweight to 4M.

Interesting, BTCC not on the list. Did Bobby finally published his withdrawal?
EDIT: BTCC not on the miners list, only under Exchanges (which is quite irrelevant since 1-Oct China ban)
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:47:00
I wonder why they need to have BIP49 path as an user input? Let the wallet decide and dont bother users, e.g. do it like Trezor web wallet (m/49' ...).
Electrum 3.0 release notes:
"P2SH-segwit scripts are supported and can be used with hardware wallets. To create a segwit wallet, trezor/ledger users will need to provide a BIP49 derivation path."

Charlie, thank you for nice words that make sense! Any plans of talking your brotho into BTCC pool staying loyal to Core?
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:45:34
Its not 95%, many miners are false signalling. On top of that, F2Pool already announced NYA withdrawal and my guess is that BTCC (and mayb BitFury) are soon to follow.
@_date: 2017-09-12 06:36:47
Cool! My full node is ready for 0.15.0. Already looking fwd to 0.15.1 which brings bech32, native SegWit address.

@_date: 2017-10-28 14:08:37
Things are being done to help bitcoin scale better. So far most of the community users agree that quality-improvement steps be taken first before any quantity adjustment. At current, the best you can do is to spend BTC from SegWit addresses in SegWit compatible wallet (Electrum should be soon). This will result in less transaction size (or better weight) and will cost you less.
Other code changes are being prepared - e.g. Schnorr to aggregate signatures better (quite your usecase). And more (MAST, CT...).
And the last thing to mention is the Lightning Network (LN) which is solution built on top of BTC network. So called 2nd layer. It will have radically lower fees compared to BTC chain but may see different user experience. But this is certainly the way to go. Lets see if there will be any mainnet LN provider this year.
@_date: 2018-04-11 18:16:25
Thanks for clarification! So Im wondering why would anybody use covert version when overt is overall better?
@_date: 2016-10-28 15:40:54
Nice work! Big thanks to CoreDEV team!
Will segwit activation mean Lightning Network can be deployed right away or does Lightning requires further changes to the bitcoin code?
@_date: 2017-05-08 19:30:13
I enjoy running BTC full node on my RPI3. And Im grateful for Core's optimalizations that allows that. Only hope that there will be new model/more powerful RPI by the time Confidential txs appear.

Why is Asicboost OK all of the sudden? I know we are talking about overt and with no political agenda (like stopping SegWit) now BUT - doesnt Asicboost still criple the block content? E.g. ommiting certain txs or even mining empty blocks sometimes?

Excellent response!
