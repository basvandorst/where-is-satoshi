Serious question: When buying large amounts like that, what legal concerns do you have about money laundering (assuming you're in the USA)? 
I almost had the chance to buy about 10% that much, and was scared about getting on the governments radar for something as trivial as spending a large amount of money.
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:58:45
First off, all of your comments are sincere and inquisitive, and no one should be bashing you for that.
Now on to the question, yes it's possible, but everything from here on out is speculation/guessing. Can they do it, yes. Would it hurt BTC... tough to say, we could theorise about it all day, but we don't actually know.

I posted this in the other XAPO thread.
Notice: I have had very poor customer service and website stability with Xapo. I've been trying to transfer out my remaining .0008 BTC for about 3 weeks now with not much help from support. 
That being said, if they improved their service, and the website actually worked all the time, I may consider going back to them.
They are the original company I remember offering insurance on your cold storage with them, and multiple layers of physical security on the cold storage assets. 
I really like the ideas this company has, but their implementation of them are really lacking.

Isn't NFC that same technology in credit cards to wave your card and pay for something? That is susceptible to hackers. 
I saw a report where someone walking down the street had a scanner in their pocket, and by getting close enough to the credit cards, it picked up the information. 
Isn't this true for these Bitcoin cards too? I may be mixing up my technology, but I think NFC is easily hacked... Mythbusters was even told not to produce an episode on it.

You know, I really like the idea of your service, but have a few questions/comments:  
* Why does your free service offer more features than your paid services?
* How do you handle letters/envelopes? I didn't see an option about rates for this.
* How does repackaging actually save money if we have to have the things shipped to you anyway?
* Your features page linked to from the home page does not work 
* Your "we're hiring" link is just an anchor # and nothing shows up.
* Your fee calculator didn't work for me the first try, no results showed up.
Since all of this makes your company appear very new and possibly not thorough enough in full quality control/systems, I will hold off a little before I use this, but I am very interested.

This is what I was wondering. I thought that if there were "unowned coins" that have never been owned, then I couldn't understand why people would pay XXX for a coin, when there were just unowned coins sitting around.
Also I didn't get where all the money selling coins went if they were not owned by people. The only answer was that all coins in existence were at one time owned by someone.

Your reply, and that link goes a long way. I'll check out the talk. 
Sorry, but that blog that is linked to from this article looks low quality, and the banner on that page saying that you can buy BTC with credit card or paypal all makes it seem fishy. If something seems too good to be true, it's often a scam.
Again, I have no judgement here, just saying how it looks. I'm off to check out that thread now.
UPDATE: Just read the thread, there is one user vouching for the owner of bitcoininsanity, but not much else. There are 1 or 2 users whom said they purchased, but they never came back to confirm delivery. I assume they got their coins, or they would be back in the thread complaining. 
I don't know what else can be done to earn trust... it's like you need trust to gain trust... catch22.

@_date: 2014-03-03 15:13:26
Good point. My stance is that yes, it has had value, and I believe that every year/month/day whatever, it's losing value. It's losing value because it's not backed by anything. There is no zero for the USD economy, they will just print more and more until we have these 
To me, that's not backed by anything. 
To be clear, I'm just regurgitating things I've heard, and I know almost nothing about in depth economy.

I could give you a public/private combo, but that would be insecure.
What I mean is, I've generated hundreds of address pairs for myself, and store them in an encrypted file container. Anytime I need a cold storage address, I use one. I know there are many pairs less than 30 characters. If this is a one time use thing, and you want to trust a complete internet stranger, I can help you out.
edit: I haven't actually checked the list yet, but I remember seeing some lines with less characters and thought they looked odd, so I'm sure I have some less than 30.
@_date: 2014-04-24 17:55:28

You have two colors, red and blue. Blue is your private key, and red is your public key. Now when you mix these two colors you get purple.
The network can then check the color you provided (purple) to be sure that red plus blue made the exact color. If you're any variation other than true purple, then you had the wrong colors to start with.
Crappy example, but you get the idea of one way encryption.
Of course this is just from a video posted here recently, and I could be completely wrong, but it gets your mind thinking.

So, the cost of letter forwarding is $0.95 per letter? I live in an RV and plan to travel the country/world, and want to know the cost of forwarding letters. Can I do it on a weekly basis, say you receive email and hold it until Friday, then mail it? Or similar, you hold it until I ask it to be sent to me?

Is there a way that I, as a web programmer, can assist the "core bitcoin" development? What's the best way to use my coding ability to further enhance bitcoin?

Any reason you went with 24 words to memorize? I am still working on my 12 from electrum. It's 12 uber secure? I don't really expect to have to remember 24 random words as technology progresses, and think that 12 should be enough? Where am I wrong?

It is only 40 cents at the current rate... but at the future rate, who knows.
It seems my posts are skirting the downvote bots! I'll upvote yours to counteract them.

I'm going to set up an address for my new child (due later this year), and my current young child.
I just had an idea to "tip" them throughout their lives, to this BTC savings account that they don't know about. I will send money into it regularly as I can, but anytime they do something nice, I will send a  little more to their account, with a note attached on the blockchain. Something along the lines of "Helped an elderly gentleman pick up his napkin".
This way, when they turn 18, and I give them the addresses, they can see all the past things they did that was rewarded. They should also have a nice nest egg to start life with.

I really wanted to read it, but don't want to increase the page views by being forced to read a couple paragraphs per page. I hate that business model. There is no benefit to the user, only the site owner stats.

Just bought .44 at 517! Woohoo! Lowest I've bought at yet.

I have created an account! 
Playing around, I noticed two things:
Typo in your notice to USPS customers:


It should say "otherwise it will be made subject to destruction" or possibly "otherwise it may be subject to destruction".
Also there is no link anywhere that I see to manage my forwarding address. (or manage my account settings for that matter)

I had my mouse cursor over the downvote button while reading your comment.... good play with that last sentence.

They need to form bitcoin meetups in bank lines.

How many bitcoins are there that are generated, but don't belong to anyone? Are there any?

Notice: I have had very poor customer service and website stability with Xapo. I've been trying to transfer out my remaining .0008 BTC for about 3 weeks now with not much help from support. 
That being said, if they improved their service, and the website actually worked all the time, I may consider going back to them.
They are the original company I remember offering insurance on your cold storage with them, and multiple layers of physical security on the cold storage assets. 
I really like the ideas this company has, but their implementation of them are really lacking.
