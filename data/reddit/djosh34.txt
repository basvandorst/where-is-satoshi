the lightning network is still extremely buggy. please don't do this
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:06:54
they are. But everyone is talking about how bitcoin is gold and that the (not without its issues) lightning network is coming. I don't get it either. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:20:21
I love bitcoin cash, but have more in bitcoin core (fiat wise) than bitcoin cash because I can't move my fucking coins due to those high transaction fees. 
It will take years before LN takes of and failes because you can't use it on mobile phones (has to be always online or can only spend) and segwit is just a way of scaling the network without hardforking but it doesn't fix the underlying problem. 5 months ago the devs promised lower transaction fees and look where we are now. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 18:46:32
That's not true if the lightning network will be implemented like these say  Then it will be a lot like the internet ( independent nodes interconnected with payment channels)

How much was your transaction fee
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:17:42
still 5 because one input is one unspent transaction. The amount of addresses yiu used are irrelevant. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 09:08:14
He misses the nLocktimed transactions within the payment channels what makes monitoring the blockchain unnecessary. Then it will be possible for more people to open hubs and that leads to more decentralization. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:05:04
You could have set a lower transaction fee. What wallet are you using. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 10:53:35
Get it off the exchange as fast as possible, but keep high transaction fees in mind. I would recommend a paper wallet, but if you aren't tech-savvy enough, then I'd recommend sending you're coins to a wallet like exodus or jaxx.

just go to Amsterdam 
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:52:53
that makes no sense. miners spam the network to get higher transaction fees?
@_date: 2018-06-11 14:49:52
42 *.1 doge = 4.2 doge
4.2 doge = 1.31754  dollarcent. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:50:45
You can go to bitcoinfees.21.co to see what you're minimum transaction fee should be, but I know, fees are kinda high on bitcoin right now. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:20:56
wait what
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:10:38
what was your fee
@_date: 2018-06-30 22:43:17
can I get there without flying?!
@_date: 2017-08-27 07:24:37
its decentralized so you mine less fees back then you would invest. 
@_date: 2019-02-16 22:16:28
Unpopulair opinion here, inflation is good
@_date: 2019-02-17 09:54:22
I’m not saying hyperinflation is good, but a stable inflation of 2% does benifit the economy unlike bitcoin, which either only goes up in value, like we all want and therefore make it so that people don’t spend anymore or bitcoin will vade away due to the transaction speed problems and only be used by a few
@_date: 2019-02-24 17:37:47
Sudden drops and rises are expected in crypto
@_date: 2018-03-27 08:20:32
why the fuck would you want to run a node. Do you even run a node with a 300 GB blockchain size. Of course not. Only mining pools and bitcoin merchants would do that. And they have way faster internet and more money for harddrives than any of us do. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 17:57:26
Are you a mining pool or a merchant ( and then I mean something like bitpay or coinbase)?
@_date: 2017-09-10 14:40:08
to be honest.... I never did
@_date: 2017-09-04 20:17:35
And then pay 10 dollars of everytransaction you've made to your wallet
@_date: 2018-03-27 12:50:40
But why do you. There's literally no reason for you to run a node. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 14:08:08
Move all your bitcoin to a computer. A paper wallet is a secure wallet you print and can send bitcoins to. It's like a cheque
@_date: 2017-09-09 13:00:19
seems legit 
@_date: 2018-07-25 14:54:26
But you see very clearly the centralized points in the graph. Not so decentralized as I've had hoped. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 16:20:31
transaction fees are killing it
@_date: 2017-09-04 20:18:10
I would consider putting in 300 dollars a month then
@_date: 2018-07-25 19:15:47
I Was wondering if I would be banned for saying this here. Most of the time people get banned for negativity on Bitcoin.
