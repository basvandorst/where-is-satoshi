How about read the article instead bud?

Stop trying to scare people with the goberment taking your civil liberties bullshit. It’s a lazy and unnecessary comment. Just explain your point stop trying to insert this left/right bs.

Supply and demand. It’s a store of value so people use this in countries where currencies have become highly devalued or if they are underbanked as it can be transferred easily from mobile phone to mobile phone. 
Think of this, where does the Euro get its value? No where really, everyone just agrees it has value because it’s easier than exchanging goods or rocks (gold/silver). It’s the same concept but worldwide and digitally. There is also no central bank who is able to manipulate the value by printing more money or making more Bitcoins, there is only a finite amount. But I should point out that a private actor or group of actors can manipulate Bitcoin themselves if they have enough. Depends on a countries laws at that point.

Same way I can’t opt out of buying car insurance? I have to buy it if I’m driving.  You guys complain a lot.

If they don’t treat ether as a security, how can they treat any ICO as a security? This will likely lead to an increase in Ponzi scheme ICOs.

I get some of your points but don’t really agree. Cheers tho!

But Americans aren’t really responsible. That’s the reason we have social security. People couldn’t even save for the future and plan for retirement. The last financial crisis was also a product of irresponsible Americans (lenders and borrowers). We can also look back in history before the SEC was setup, we saw businesses selling their securities (lots of worthless stuff) and taking advantage of citizens because they were good salespeople. 
There should be some sort of opt-out though. Like fill out paperwork and no more SEC protection because you actively do not want it. Would you just disband the whole SEC? Anything worth saving from the institution? 
I’m always at [undisclosed location] I’ll take that beer! Also having one now so decided to reply, just want to get more of your thoughts on the SEC. Haha.
P.S. I saw Jay Clayton one time at Chopt salad.

Why the hate for the SEC? I thought investor protection was good. Isn’t your gripe with the Fed?
@_date: 2018-06-16 08:27:59
I think it’s dead wrong. The SEC has lost all credibility. Idk how they could argue they are able to regulate any ICOs. I believe this is a negative for the crypto community.

I never said he was wrong about Bitcoin. He is just batshit crazy about most other stuff so not credible for people to believe this one time.

I would not be relying on this guy to give bitcoin credibility.

Na could care less about that. Stop being so insecure. It’s the killing on foreign soil that bothers me. The election interference. Etc.

Ban its use? If the rich hold it they can take a lil hit by its ban. And idk what powerful people that can influence lawmaking hold it. Do you?

Or a crackdown in the US if it’s used to evade sanctions 
@_date: 2019-01-10 03:25:35
Thanks for the 6 year old article dipshit. Also disingenuous for you to use that as a point as if it would stop the govt from regulating it. It’s just seized bitcoins that they would give two shits about losing.

Russia is actually a threat to the US.

Can’t use anything connected to the US financial system if that’s the reason.

And in your opinion, did we actually use our full military capabilities? Or did we hold back our most deadly weapons because we were worried about civilian casualties? My point is if you have a government that’s not worried about civilian casualties, there really is little hope of surviving. Especially when our government presumably has control over most communications across the United States. Our government runs as a trust based system, assault rifles in the hands of civilians ain’t doing shit. 
Also ISIS had all of our old military hardware, and isis was made up of old Iraqi commanders, I wouldn’t say they were uneducated or poor or untrained.

Not gonna lie i didn’t read anything you said. If you’re typing that much you should throw some sources in there, i don’t care about your opinion that much to read all that. 
I did read the last sentence though, what you are saying is that if the process to repeal an amendment were followed, there would be a civil war? And I thought democracy was real in America. (Just kidding, I’ve never thought that)
@_date: 2018-04-05 20:36:23
If we wanted to flatten the whole Middle East we could. Just because we show restraint by not using nuclear bombs doesn’t mean they have a chance against us in a real war. I will also note that the US is massive compared to these tiny countries. I point this out because  any attempt to organize will be cut off by the US because they control most forms of communication. Our government is a trust based system, it’s something you need to accept.

Well seeing as PayPal wasn’t holding her money??? She was actually holding PayPal’s money. I’m not a fan of banks but don’t get stupid with it. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 20:34:19
I guess hiding in a mountain is “still around” but isis was never a threat to the US, even with all the military equipment ISIS took from the Iraqi army (which was old US equipment).
