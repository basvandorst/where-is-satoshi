@_date: 2013-12-06 05:00:58
 This conversation happened in localbitcoin's chat? 
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:04:13
 I would but I don't know why reddit never lets me post like 2 different topics, he tells me I post too much &gt;.&gt;
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:02:15
 And it happened.. Nice time to have bad service kraken.. Nice effing time.. I have been losing money unable to sell from you and now the bubble just poped.. &gt;.&gt;
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:27:42
 Cool :) Where did you buy it? I want to but don't know where -.- 
 I am from Mexico
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:47:35
 So the total amount of money invested in Bitcoin right now is $9,000,000,000 ?? (12,000,000 coins x $750)
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:21:25
 Almost forgot, what do you think of bitcoins? For example no one in my family would know about them if it weren't for me, what about you? Are they popular where you live? 
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:08:41
 That's what I thought, I think localbitcoins is the best option, the fees and time in the other methods.. Ughh -.-
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:40:33
 Thanks guys, after I open the wall or BTC address... Like I can check it on that page or what?
 Sorry but I didn't know about any of this.. -.-
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:27:17
 I'm not very intelligent but.. Wouldn't amazon accepting the currency help it? I mean people would probably buy more bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:54:06
 Ok I got an address from blockchain, I clicked on receive and I see an address (I guess that's the address I am gonna send to people to make transactions and so) but what about my private address? Where do I find that in block chain?
 Thanks in advance.
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:59:37
 So basically you think he/she doesn't want to sell anymore?
 Is there anything I can do? 
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:16:14
 Guys so what do I need to make the payment via western union, becasue the seller only told me the follwoing:
Name, Last name and City.
 Now when I went to pay in my local westernunion they didn't ask me for my referral number (the referal that localbitcoins gave me..) so I decided not to pay at that moment.. Why did localbitcoins gave me a referal number if they didnt ask for it on westernunion.
 Help I am supr confused &gt;.&gt;
@_date: 2013-12-06 05:03:23
Eh? Why in PM? 
Some people buy from localbitcoins and would be glad to know of scammers.
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:08:29
 Think of it this way:
 Does anyone in your family know about it? Do your friends? Do your co-workers?
 Right now bitcoin is still a very niche market (IMO) but its gonna become popular.
 That or it just dies, but it has the potential to become waaaay bigger than it is right now.
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:19:10
Can't seem to find the thread.. Help?
