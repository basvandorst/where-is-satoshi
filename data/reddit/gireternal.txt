Done. And thanks for the cool fuckin shirt. Will rep it around Tokyo.

Just ordered a shirt. Can't wait to get it. I'm in Tokyo so it might be a while by air. Cheers.

Pattaya is full of sharks. I'm not surprised. In this age of early adoption, if anyone goes out to eat or drink, ask if they accept BTC before you order. Sorry to hear about your bad experience bro.

So you want people posting "to the moon!!" and "here comes my lambo!!" over and over again on a daily basis? Everything seems pretty dandy to me.

In 2010 when a couple of friends were purchasing from the Silk Road.

Nearly 100 from 10k. Let's go!

Even if she's specifically asked me to?

Here's to at least 20 million more! (but hopefully 7.5 billion)

I'm a long term hodler and have told her to hold on to it for a number of years until we can see what mass adoption brings.

Honestly mate, you're the one look pretty scummy here. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 23:56:53
Yeah she has specifically asked for me to get Bitcoin for her. She doesn't know a lot about it but wants to own some so has designated some money. I'll set her up with a wallet and get it through my local exchange.

Nice. I want. Cant wait to see the new designs. I'd be very happy with a heavier tshirt with a thicker crew neck.

Still reppin my 'Satoshis Pizza' T-shirt each and ever week bro. Keep up the good work.
