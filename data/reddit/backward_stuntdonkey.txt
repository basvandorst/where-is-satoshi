On my nationwide statement nothing has shown leaving my bank it looks like coinbase rejected it so it was sent back or never started 
Looks like I'll use cex.io to withdraw when they allow new members again :)

The problem with bitcoin is everyone wants everyone else to spend and use theirs so their own goes up in value

The trainwreck to zero ? 
Bitcoin had a chance and it didn’t work. You aren’t overthrowing any banks anytime soon ��
@_date: 2019-02-08 08:42:09
I guess. I’ve been brokering for 20 years and make regular overpayments 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:38:25
@_date: 2019-02-02 17:04:21
Yes . Bitcoin will never be the currency of the internet. It’s just to slow and unstable 
@_date: 2019-02-08 11:34:17
That’s not good :( and yeah few of my friends are stuck :( 
@_date: 2019-02-07 22:51:22
Yeah ! They will just roll over and let you live in a free world because bitcoin ! Wahooo!
Regulation incoming 
@_date: 2019-02-07 22:52:50
You don’t get to pick either as the world government won’t let you

@_date: 2019-02-02 16:55:55
No it’s not . More people use fiat online 
@_date: 2019-02-08 01:21:49
The bank helped me get a £400,000 house with less then a 1.7% rate with my deposit 
I like banks. My money is also safe in one and secured and insured .

Bitcoin - literally the only use case is the next guy pays more than you so yours goes up in value......
@_date: 2019-04-22 17:10:24
You lost me at inexpensive to transmit

My brother traded 20 btc for some fancy camera and lens several years ago 
@_date: 2019-04-01 12:54:05
I don’t . I sold what I had in late 2017 and am now all in on xrp 
Ready for the bashing hahah , it’s money I can afford to lose but let’s hope it goes somewhere between now and 2050
@_date: 2018-11-17 00:06:03
And if you ever think bitcoin will replace or circumvent the banks on a global daily use case scale you need to wake up xD :D :D 
@_date: 2019-01-06 20:00:17
Disclaimer . I like bitcoin and hold some .
It’s not absolutely robust - you can send coins to the wrong place if you are not careful . Can’t wander into Halifax and accidentally pay to NatWest 
It’s also being manipulated on a daily basis almost on a macro scale. It’s not “absolutely “ robust 
It’s not completely censorship immune either. Most people only care for its value and are too scared to use it increase it shoots up in value and they lose out. Goes back to it not being absolutely robust .
You think that the banking cartel would stand around and watch if it actually threatened the petro / war / dollar on a global basis . No of course they wouldn’t they would tank the price to £0 
It’s a fantastic invention but it’s not all you say it is .

Don’t do this 
Do some background on xrp 
Look who’s leaving what to join ripple 
Hold both
@_date: 2019-05-30 20:00:43
