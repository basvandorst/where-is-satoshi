Trucoin is working with BitPay as a co-sponsor for the Bitcoin St. Petersburg Bowl on December 26th. This will mark the first time that Trucoin has provided consumer services at a bitcoin event.

I stand corrected. While I pay close attention to as much bitcoin related news as I can, sometimes my schedule doesn't allow me to catch everything. In any case, Genesis Coin does not currently offer that functionality.

Please feel free to PM me if you do not receive prompt support. Most folks do not run into any issues but from time to time there can be a slight hold up due some of our IP restrictions. Both compliance and fraud present unique challenges in that regard.

It's not to spy, and we do not share your information with third parties. There is a convenience factor for many consumers and while we understand that others may be averse to using a social login, we use it to help prevent fraud. One thing that comes with being in the space and accepting irreversible payment methods for bitcoin is the exposure to fraud.

Although close to 90% of folks are able to create an account and buy bitcoin without any delays, there are some that unfortunately have to go through a few more verification checks in our system. When this happens we do our very best to expedite this and make it easy on our customers. There are some verification checks, even at smaller purchase amounts, that we cannot avoid.
We believe that our current offering is solid but streamlining any pain points and making it as simple as possible on our customers will continue to be our goal. Additional payment options will be offered -- in order to provide our customers with even more flexibility -- in the very near future. We will also be expanding our coverage soon to to include even more US states.
We would love to receive any suggestions or general feedback -- feel free to PM us or use support -- so that we can listen to the community and improve all current and future products.

+1 for giving it a shot.

Our goal is to operate our company uninterrupted and provide as many people easy access to bitcoin as possible. Part of accomplishing that involves being compliant. If that wasn't the case, our job would be a lot easier and we could have launched our service years ago. Keep in mind that we are a start up, we just happened to have taken the approach that being compliant is important for longevity in our space.

Thank you very much for sharing AstarJoe! We will continue to work hard to enhance the customer experience and bring you new useful features. Your feedback does *not* go unnoticed!!

1) That is a question best posed to BitPay; We are not involved on the merchant side of things.
2) The KYC requirements will be the same as our flagship product ( The difference will be a *slightly* different experience in person, although we are working to make them a similar experience.

No, we are not a manufacturer. Our software and compliance system are what powers the Bitcoin ATMs. We set out to do this as a compliant bitcoin retailer, to help ensure that the consumers had an easy way to acquire more bitcoin at the event. The core offering for Trucoin is our online product.

We are looking to provide everyone with a way to purchase the most bitcoin and receive deliver on it immediately. One thing we have worked hard to do is afford nearly all of our customers the chance to buy as much btc with a debit or credit card in a day -- even after you have just created an account -- that most other sites will only offer after a week or more.
@_date: 2014-11-12 22:38:10
This isn't a conflict. Our final ATM solution will involve accepting debit and credit cards which, to our knowledge, is not a current offering in the bitcoin ATM space.

That is in the works!

Thanks abarn! I am glad to hear you had a great experience.

Update! Today we will begin letting folks in from all of the states we can legally operate in. This will include NJ. Keep an eye out for an email from us today or tomorrow and you will have access to buy bitcoin again!
@_date: 2014-11-14 19:03:43
Indeed we do, and can! We try to monitor reddit to answer questions, but at times it can be hard to find every mention. That is why we also set up so we may field any general questions or comments.
@_date: 2014-11-14 19:06:17
Not at this time. We use social network logins for user convenience and to help us verify that we are not dealing with a fraudster. It isn't the only factor but it helps on both accounts.
@_date: 2014-11-03 21:32:04
We are working hard on licensing and compliance so that we will be able to support the remaining states. This has been a long process for us (years). If you are signed up already, you will be alerted as soon as our service is available in your area.

We aren't by any means 'hitmen' for any government entity. Trucoin was founded in 2011 and from the beginning we have fully appreciated that part of being in this space for the long haul involved being compliant. There have been a long line of predecessors, even prior to bitcoin existing, that did not take compliance and regulation into account and it did not end well for them.
