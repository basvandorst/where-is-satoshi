I don't think you know what a knife really means. A knife means it's going to 0. So if you don't think it's going to 0 then don't use the term. Tired of people trying to use verbiage they don't understand to make it seem like they're in the know

Even so. 60% reduction is back down to 3,200. Not 2,000. What did you sell at ?

china declared ICO's illegal (for now)
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:35:38
GDAX or Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:52:37
what do you think will trigger that. because clearly a huge event like China made a quick panic dent and it's already almost back up agian
@_date: 2017-09-04 08:26:16
well this is a very legit reason its dropping, so it's going to be much worse

Coinbase and gdax are same company. Coinbase is geared to total newbies. You can graduate after one trade to Gdax. Not saying you can't start with gdax, but best to do a small trade or two on coinbase to get an idea

What is the timeline in your opinion that it reaches 2,000?

cool thanks for the insight. won't rush into buying more now even though it's tempting I guess. I've only spent $1K so far at these fairly high prices, guess still can buy in low if what you say happens
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:37:38
Coinbase, then quickly move over to GDAX. same login, same everything. just no/lower fees
@_date: 2017-09-04 20:06:47
Those were different times no? You would never see coin prices on national TV.
@_date: 2017-09-10 08:37:10
When you sometimes say yes 
But you sometimes say no…
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:38:06
why not buy here? what's going to keep driving it lower
@_date: 2017-07-11 05:11:38
