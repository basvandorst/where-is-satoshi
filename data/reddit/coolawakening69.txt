You do acknowledge whales are spamming the bitcoin blockchain with tiny meaningless transactions, burning copious amounts of money, right?

Nothing is a gamble. Everything is an investment.

In my own definitions an investment and a gamble are not different in practice, but in nature a gamble is an uneducated investment while an investment is backed by education.

I must admit, I don’t care about volatility. Yes it gets to everyone, yes there are minimal exceptions. I like to think I handle it better than others. What I care about is a future of decentralization bitcoin can provide. Any part I can play in that future is fine with me. Volatility be damned.

We know that crypto to crypto is now a taxable event, capital gains short/long term. However, do you need to pay these capital gains taxes before you actually cash out your crypto into fiat again? For example, I sold .1 bitcoin for let's say 10 Ethereum a while back, and I still hold this Ethereum. Let's say I made $1000 on this trade as of right now based on current market prices. Do I need to pay taxes on this if it's still held in cryptocurrency?
