Unless you are speculating in a forex account, no they don't.  If you buy euros and they happen to appreciate before you spend them there is no taxable event.
Now IRS guidence is apparently that bitcoin is an asset not a currency. If people show they are using it as a currency you could challenge the guidance.

Don't use the same number as the card you carry for online and payments.  Just add yourself with a slight name variation as an authorized user to your account and use the two numbers for different purposes.

Nah, you are missing the point.   It is exactly not a nebulous promise.  It is an account held in trust for you titled with your name on it.  You do have it.   You have some control over the asset allocation for it,  for your specific money in it.   Mine was completely in stocks, while a coworkers was 75/25 stocks/bonds.   It is exactly what you think it is not, something you have.  I  made sure to get my 100% match, so was up 100% to start, and got over a 10% annual return, all tax deferred.  When I left that job, I rolled it over to a rollover IRA held at the place of my choice,  and got more free money as a bonus for doing the rollover to them.  Yeah, bitcoin has done better, but to ignore it (401k) as part of your options,   well stayhungryandfoolish, but please don't miseducate others about it.

Ah, yes, neighborhood nuclear superiority is good to have.

I think you wanted to say arbitrary not random.

Better to say it is tax deferred if a regular 401k and tax free earnings if a Roth 401k

Personally I want a self driving Tesla I think.   Let the car drive and free up driving time for catching up on other things.

A 401k is not a pension.  You do not lose the money contributed and it earned when you change jobs.  If you are fully vested that includes the match.   It is what replaced a pension as an option for many.  If you have one available to you you should reconsider taking advantage of it rather than confusing it with a pension.
