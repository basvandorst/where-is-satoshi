I actually agree. Dark day for BTC at large but it's encouraging to see that sort of outreach. It mirrors the spirit of transparency of crypto itself.

It defies the laws of physics at times. I've lost a phone *in my own car*.

Buy a few dozen on coinbase, make a wallet, make sure you cash out the moment you think you should, and when in doubt, always remember that Impulsive Thinking is your best friend.

Honestly, not really that difficult for the benefits they could reap. Small updates, a few pictures, a little bit of technical information here and there. 
Judging by this thread there's a lot of interest.

Yeah, but once you convert the fiat to Bitcoin, you can hide it pretty well.
@_date: 2016-07-25 17:46:58
Or, you can turn it back into fiat in smaller amounts, making it untraceable.

Holy shit

Thanks, Olaf.

It would obviously be a very niche readership but niche readers are always the most loyal.
Listen to this guy, even if it's not you writing it, someone on your team should. What you're doing is very unique and there's always people interested in the new and different (BTC being a prime example).
Not only ad money but potential investorship, media coverage, etc.

Well, yeah, money laundering is a great way to go to prison for money laundering.
