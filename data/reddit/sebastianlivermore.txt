Generally the way it works is you need to withdraw the funds the same way they were deposited. You got away with it in the past because either your amount was small or someone made a mistake. 
This has nothing to do with BItcoin. You generally CANT transfer large funds from exchange to exchange unless its your IRA.

Is it very possible that when you receive it they might have some "hacked" firmware and also very possible that in the future there will be viruses can that wait for you to plug it into your USB and try to steal your seeds and private keys.
Best way to avoid this is to use Paper Wallets on offline linux and destroy the printer afterwards 
Use cold storage with electrum with an AIR-GAPPED system like by either scanning QR codes or destroying the USB sticks when you are done with them...
This is only for the extremely paranoid and maybe when BTC &gt; $100,000

Very interesting website. If you look closely it seems that for every bitcoin bubble ( Summer 2011, April 2013, Nov 2013 ) there were many UTXO and it still seems that many who bought during those bubbles are still holding their coins.  Really nuts that people who bought the ATH at $30, still didn't sell.

Its not a gambling addiction, its just what trading does to retail traders.
Many enter a position, and when it goes up, they quickly take profit.
When they enter a losing position, they don't close the position at a loss, they want to "close at break-even". 
Its a psychological thing, nobody likes to lose money.
The OP however at least in the end ended up breaking even, because he didn't actually lose money.

Cold storage your shit!

Buy the exact same SSD drive ( Sandisk U110 or whatever) and remove the NAND chips from the burnt drive onto the new SSD. 
Search for surface mount soldering on Youtube to see how you can do this.
Don't apply too much heat or you will kill your data forever.
Since this is alot of money, buy a few of these SSDs and practice first swapping the NAND chips and verify if they work in the end. With enough practice do your burnt SSD.

I did similiar research. Basically coins prior to 2014, about 3.5 million haven't been spent since today.So a high percentage of these are considered lost since price went from like $1000 to $200 to $8700.
If not lost then "pure hodling" and won't enter the market anytime soon so for the short-term we can say its out of circulation reducing the overall available supply.

Problem is. If you withdraw an amount that large usually the exchange will freeze your withdraw until you prove how you got the funds. Need to show employment slips, net worth papers, tax papers, etc.
So if someone poor mined with a CPU in 2009 will have a hard time selling if they quit their job because their BTC value went up.

The issue is that people might get over-leveraged and since these futures don't trade on the weekend, might lead to huge losses for the broker if the retail trader doesn't have enough funds in their account to cover them.
Basically if they give 1:20 leverage, means someone with $10,000 can buy/sell $200,000 worth of Bitcoin. If something happens during Sat/Sun when the future markets are closed and it changes value by 10%. Then the trader is sitting at a -$20000 loss with only $10,000 of their funds to cover it.

Before you withdraw an amount that large make sure your bank is comfortable with Bitcoin. Do some research from others depositing/withdrawing with different banks in Canada.
Some banks, I think "TD Bank" if they find out you are involved in anyway with Bitcoin, they will close your account. Which is a very bad red flag on your credit and if you ever will try getting a mortgage in the future it might prevent you.

@_date: 2017-10-24 22:19:39
I think what these hardware wallets need is a way to be able to sign the transaction without physically needing to be plugged into the online computer. Such as having a camera built in and a larger screen to display the signed transaction that can be scanned with a camera with an iphone/webcam with the online computer. I think adding a larger screen AND a cheap 1MP camera wouldn't add too much to the cost.

Or is it a BIP38 encrypted wallet like at Bitaddress.org, if its the latter its impossible to brute force, especially with 26 characters. Since mosts CPUs brute force that at 10-20 hashes/sec.

Similiar scenario except the ~$2800 high would act as support and maybe  could be ignored. But the 2013 ATH would still be considered very strong support.

Can someone ELI5 of how can they get scammed this way?
Say they only have 3 confirmations and then they send out your ETH (or whatever currency you bought)
So if there is a 50%/50% signalling rate and from time to time blocks get orphaned, don't use orphaned blocks go back to the mempool and confirm later?
How would they get scammed exactly?
When it orphans someone does a double spend ?
@_date: 2017-07-21 09:35:28

Seems many here are trading for the very first time in their lives and panicking. Here is the basic TA for the near term. Bitcoin seems to follow TA more than Fundamentals lately.
1) $2000 Psychological number. Where we are now. Hopefully this holds.
2) Demand area, since we sharply rallied away from this area. Might act as support.
3) Both the old 2013 ATH so (Resistance -&gt; Support) and the start of the major Bull flag which indicates a demand/support area.
If we break  then its going to be chaos. Very very bad.

I have a feeling this might be like ETH / ETC all over again.
ETC was launched on Polo and since to most ETH holders it was "free money" so there was alot of selling. Everybody including myself thought that the coin would be worth 0 Sats but it survived. And a few months later it was worth alot, however everybody sold for pennies on the dollar.
What if this BCC launches, and everybody sells their BCC for pennies on the dollar and then a few months later BCC overtakes BTC. And we would be screwed since we sold our BCC. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:39:38

Bitcoin is legal in Canada but some banks don't like any transaction going through them. They have closed bank accounts if anyone does any transactions with bitcoin exchanges.
Also you can't buy/sell bitcoins for profit without a money transmitter license. This is to make sure you comply with anti-money laundering laws.

Anyone with an iOS know if your Google authenicator codes are saved during the Device backup?
I remember with the older iOS it never saved them and you had to type them in again. However with the new iOS 10 I am not sure that is still the case.
Because most people have their iOS backup on their computer and if the Authenicator codes are somewhere in the iOS phone backups, it seems insecure.
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:10:40

Anyway to check how many downloads their software have gotten to estimate the damage?

According to 
Current Segwit2X
This tries a similar trick but first relies on 80% of miners saying they are ready and support it. Here another signalling bit is used (Bit 4) first before the actual Segwit BIP 9 bit. The Segwit2X code run by miners sets out that once 80% of blocks that they mine are signalling using bit 4 they (the 80+%) will then orphan any blocks that don't signal Segwit under the BIP 9 rule.
The net result is that 100% of blocks they mine are then signalling Segwit and BIP 9's 95% activation threshold is triggered. Because this activates Segwit under BIP 9 all existing Segwit ready nodes then get Segwit.
If Segwit is activated on the main chain then all existing Segwit ready nodes will see that Segwit has been enabled - not just the nodes running Segwit2X. You do not have to change your node from your Core or UASF node to benefit from this.

Go look at the BTC richlist genius. Also all of Satoshi's coins have public key exposed.
If there is some Quantum way of cracking those public keys, BTC will go to $0 anyways.
So keeping your BTC in an address without outputs will make no difference. Since you will have your BTC but they will be worth $0 anyways.

There ~2 million which are lost since they got unspent UTXO since 2010. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:25:23
They switched because they don't want ETH taking over the  market cap spot. I am pretty sure this week there will be other pools that will start signaling as well including Antpool.
Bitmain doesn't make ETH miners or GPUs. If ETH takes over, they will have no money.
@_date: 2017-06-03 16:06:39
And where are these exchanges? 
@_date: 2017-06-17 00:17:18
A few Q's
So the economic majority needs to run UASF while only the miners need to run Segwit2X? Everyone else like small services and users can still run the Core version of Bitcoin?
When 80% hashrate starts orphaning blocks not running Segwit2X what happens to the people whois transactions were in those blocks?
What happens if miners run Segwit2X to get Segwit and after Segwit is activated they go back to what they were signalling before because they don't want the Hard fork?
So when Segwit activates the entire planet has only 3 months to upgrade to the new software since the 2MB is a hard-fork. Won't this lead to a split chain anyways?
@_date: 2017-06-17 21:26:47
50% of people reuse the same address over and over. If ECDSA is cracked, bitcoin will go to $0 anyways since over 50% of all the coins would be exposed to this vulnerability.
So right now just don't worry about it.
@_date: 2017-06-20 17:53:19

Unless &gt; 1 major exchange actually runs UASF then UASF will not happen, it will just be cancelled.
There can be millions of UASF nodes but unless an actual exchange is using the UASF software, its all null.
