He refuses to even address such questions right now, which is foolish because no one cares about UI compared to these questions. 
UI should be the last thing a user considers. I wouldnt bother wasting my time even looking UI until such questions are answered, and I wouldn't waste my time suggesting UI improvements, given I have no confidence that this will be developed into a secure and low risk platform.
The avoidance of such questions is a red flag.

Whether or not I am coding an exchange is irrelevant. I am not coding an exchange. Does that mean that I shouldn't want assurance and confidence in an exchange before using it?

Please qualify the statement "in carpentry metric is often less useful than inches/feet".
I disagree, and can think of no such instance.
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:32:53
Nope, just the left one.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:19:58
Notice how he didn't say that he won't?
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:06:37
I would expect some statements pointing out reasons why you feel people should consider you to be low risk. Yes, of course they have to investigate those claims themselves. But you being unwilling to make them is a red flag to me. You're not even trying to show credibility.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:41:56
I'd write back and tell them that you are closing your account as they have violated your "don't be a cunt" policy.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:26:56
I can't help but notice that you made no effort to provide any reassurance just now.
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:51:17
But metric doesn't require ridiculous 3 digit precision....
You don't like multi digit precision but prefer to work in fractions of an inch? In what universe is that more practical than using mm? You can avoid fractions and decimals all together with metric. You make no sense man!
@_date: 2018-05-17 02:11:00
What's your point?
@_date: 2018-05-13 21:37:41
Nah, I'm think I'm going to exercise my right to express my opinion. Thanks for the suggestion though.
@_date: 2018-05-03 02:30:26
I call bullshit, you still use fiat currency.
@_date: 2018-05-08 05:38:31
What exactly does this have to do with bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-05-03 06:05:20
I don't think you understand.
@_date: 2018-05-30 02:15:15
What the fuck are you talking about? You're delusional.
@_date: 2018-05-03 07:41:09
Don't worry, he's just in it for the shitty memes like most people on this sub.
@_date: 2018-05-03 05:55:17
Like I said, I call bullshit.
@_date: 2018-05-30 02:14:00
Like most things posted on this meme sub, complete nonsense. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 02:07:09
This sub is full of some of the worst investors I've ever come across.
Enjoy your hodl memes losers. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 05:35:05
So how many other people have you PM'd spam to?
@_date: 2018-05-03 20:56:11
That and the fucking 'hodl' memes.
@_date: 2018-05-13 01:59:55
This forum sucks. It's full of memes and irrelavant statements intended to support the notion that Bitcoin is the greatest thing since sliced bread. Bitcoin's great, but it's rarely for the reasons that people post on this forum.
@_date: 2018-05-03 06:56:24
Yes, "lol" indeed.
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:19:23
1. You know nothing of my successes or failures.
2. Asking questions about security is perfectly reasonable. 
3. I never said, or even remotely implied, that I want him to fail.
4. Your comment has now been removed.
@_date: 2019-11-14 08:01:27
How exactly is Bitcoin going to be the solution to the global debt problem?
@_date: 2018-10-07 23:11:10
You forgot about the shitty hodl memes.
@_date: 2018-06-09 02:43:43
Lol, convenience of using btc. 
That whole process sounds inconvenient.
@_date: 2018-06-07 11:20:14
The community guidelines says something about how this sub is dedicated to news and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem, but 95% of what I see here is just clueless fanboys posting shitty memes. Sort your shit out mods, or are you also clueless fanboys? Half of you guys treat Bitcoin like a religion. It's not healthy. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 20:39:34
Correct, it could all fall apart and he could lose everything. Also, you clowns treat Bitcoin like a religion and "HODLING" like a prayer. It's fucking pathetic to be honest.
@_date: 2018-06-23 22:52:35
Greg made money, whereas a lot of you hodl sheep are going to lose money.
@_date: 2018-06-06 22:02:59
What a unique joke. Truly a comedic genius.
@_date: 2018-06-08 21:31:12
Probably just looking for an excuse to post that fucking stupid buzzword you all keep mindlessly repeating like a mantra regardless of context or appropriateness.
@_date: 2018-06-09 03:58:57
You know in most cases you can use fiat without having to drive to an ATM to withdraw cash, right? I rarely have cash. Tap my card. Done.
I can see how you would see it as inconvenient if that's what you previously did.... 
@_date: 2018-06-07 02:19:14
Until he realises profit he's accomplished nothing.
@_date: 2018-06-16 22:21:27
With nearly 3k upvotes. This sub is a pile of shit.
@_date: 2018-06-09 03:03:00
How is that more convenient than just using fiat?
I'm not critizing actually using btc as a currency, but to say you are doing for the sake of convenience is absurd. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 22:20:20
Nothing, it's just that the clueless folk around here need their daily fill of memes.
@_date: 2018-06-08 08:45:14
All reasonable points, I look forward to your adversary neglecting to address them in his reply.
The notion that you have to think of one Bitcoin as being worth one Bitcoin is ridiculous, and indicative of the level of intellect you are dealing with here. Wanna trade a Bitcoin for a Bitcoin? Or how about I give you a gram of gold for a gram of gold?
@_date: 2018-06-07 11:21:48
We got another comedian here with another highly original joke. How do you guys keep coming up with this shit?
@_date: 2019-08-08 12:36:32
That's a recommendation, not a prediction.
@_date: 2018-06-08 08:53:24
Is this a troll post or are people really this delusional?
@_date: 2018-06-07 22:40:42
Fuck off cunt.
Enjoy your hodl memes.
@_date: 2018-06-09 04:06:02
Haha, his friend has to pay for everything because this guy only uses btc, for convenience you see. You just don't get it. :-p
Of course, if his friend's not there he's shit out of luck but that's the price you pay for convenience.
@_date: 2019-02-26 01:50:42
The vast majority of Bitcoin transactions are just people buying and selling Bitcoin rather than using it as a currency. Totally different things. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 06:05:37


That is not his argument. His argument is:


Nothing you said debunks that point. He's not saying you have buy btc; he's saying you have to evaluate your profit against how much you *could* have made *if* you did buy btc instead. That is what determines if mining is worthwhile.
@_date: 2018-06-09 03:34:55
That's a very specific scenario you're cherry picking there. Of course there may be some situations where your method might be more convenient, but they are a minority.
@_date: 2019-02-10 04:07:02
That's irrelevant to the point he's making.....
@_date: 2017-11-25 04:24:57
You'd like to be overweight?
@_date: 2019-02-19 09:57:09
No, bitcoin got Chuck Norrised
@_date: 2019-12-29 02:51:39
Demonstrably false, much like the majority of the waffle on this sub.
@_date: 2019-12-03 07:32:19
@_date: 2019-12-12 01:49:18
You're delusional.
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:21:29
The problem with this sub is everyone puts way too much confidence into the thing that one guy says which aligns with what they want to hear. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 10:49:55
As will Bitcoin eventually. 
This is such a shill forum.
@_date: 2019-01-04 12:19:27
A bad investing decision that just happens to turn out to be profitable is still a bad investing decision.
I know it's not quite the same, but it's somewhat similar to saying "I should have put all my money on red" after watching a roulette ball land on red. No, you shouldn't have, even though it just happened to come up red. Doing so would have been a terrible, high risk gamble.
@_date: 2018-03-14 01:40:03
This meme is getting ridiculous. This sub is ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-02-21 08:23:45
What exactly does this have to do with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-07-06 23:16:32
This thread is the motherload of delusion and paranoia.
@_date: 2018-07-02 02:31:52
I have two questions. 
1. What exactly about this constitutes "street art?" Can you please identify the artistic component here?
2. What the fuck does this nonsense even mean?
@_date: 2019-09-29 02:05:45
Ah yes, memes for people who don't know the first fucking thing about economics, a staple of this shitty sub.
@_date: 2018-07-05 02:53:37
This sub in a nutshell.
@_date: 2018-07-01 22:39:18
Exactly the kind of retarded nonsense I've come to expect from this sub.
@_date: 2018-07-02 02:35:17
What the fuck is creative about this? I guess you could say that whoever did this has a very creative definition of the word "truth", but it's much more likely that they're simply a clueless degenerate.
@_date: 2018-04-23 23:31:32
Wow, you're a comedic genius. I'm not sure if I will ever recover from such a savage burn. How were you able to come up with such a witty retort?
@_date: 2018-04-25 06:16:59
How are you making rational comments on this shill-sub without being downvoted to oblivion?
@_date: 2018-04-26 01:22:39
There is already hodl posts because this sub is dominated by brainless shills who are just in this for the memes.
@_date: 2018-04-18 01:46:03
Ah, yet another baseless argument regurgitated by a clueless shill, as per r/Bitcoin tradition.
@_date: 2018-04-23 07:32:30
Is there a Bitcoin sub that isn't full of clueless shills regurgitating shitty memes and largely invalid and irrelevant arguments as to why Bitcoin is the greatest thing since sliced bread?
