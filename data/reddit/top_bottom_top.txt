This is great! Finally some great information regarding BTC in China!

Well that was silly of me. I have since changed it back to 
Sorry about that

I work near Spadina and Queen. I also spend around $20 a week on coffee (I know, I'm pretty much addicted). If there was a coffee shop in Kensington, or Queen West, or anywhere in that area that accepted Bitcoin they would have all my business.

If you are really curious about how mining profitability will change as the difficulty increases check out this calculator here
It calculates how difficulty, and therefore your mining revenue, will change based on how the network will grow.

Can you explain this a bit more? Why do they need 4 times as many confirmations?

I think it'll still be profitable. Look at this calculator. 
Put all 6,000 THash/s/day increases everyday for the next 12 months. Even if your rig starts mining in November, it'll pay itself off in 5 months. ANY investment that can pay it self off in 5 monhts is pretty damn good if you ask me.

I have created what I think is a MUCH better mining profitability calculator in Excel. You can download the .xlsx file here
Many people have asked to create a web app that delivers the same functionality. Is this possible? How much?

This is GREAT! From an investment point of view, survey like these are incredibly valuable to those wanting to understand investor sentiment and by extension what the future demand for the currency is likely to be.

I have just created a spreadsheet that answers these exact questions. The problem with  is that is doesn't allow you to make assumptions about how network hashrate will change, or how difficulty will increase with it. The model I have put together allows you to make assumptions about network hashrate increases, and then it automatically calculates when each 2016 blocks are mined, and update difficulty, daily revenue, etc. You will have to do some digging/estimating to get good assumptions about BFL and Avalon ship dates, but it'll be a better guess than existing calculators for sure.
Check it out and let me know what you think.

In all honesty this question is a little bit silly to be asking here because it depends completely on your circumstances and all you need to do is look up all the exchange rates and fees and run the numbers. 
That being said it can absolutely make sense to buy BTC with your US trading account and sell them overseas for local fiat. I am from Canada and am currently studying in Denmark. From my banks ATM I can withdraw Danish Kroners (DKK) at 5.19DKK/CAD, this is well below wholesale exchange rate. If I buy BTC throuch CaVirtex I get pinned $5 for a bank transfer, and then only 1.5%. Selling them in Denmark through localbitcoins.com and using my exchange rate means I can have the best sell price in my area and still make a bit of money per trade (about $10).
If you want to figure out the math you just have to do a "round trip" analysis. For me this entails figuring out how many CAD leave my canadian account to buy the BTC, then after fees and everything how many CAD less do I have to withdraw from my account due to the DKK I got for selling them.

For those hungry for more.

Great work! Any plans to expand this type of information?

I just built a spreadsheet to answer this exact question. Go on over to my blog and download the Excel file, fill in all the specs and you should get your answer.
The key question right now is how is network hashrate is going to increase in the near future. Over the last 6 weeks it has increased at around 1,000GHash/s/day (check out the third graph here  If you assume 1,250 for the first month, 1,500 for the second month, 1750 for the third ect. its a good place to start and should get you a reasonable answer.
Do a little digging and try and get a good estimate for when BFL and Avalon will ship, and how much they will ship. This will tighten up those estimates.
Let me know how it goes.

I did create it! Im glad you like it!

I like the thought process here! One thing to keep in mind however. 
Comparing the total energy in the diesel fuel to electrical energy used in mining isn't fair. This is because electrical energy is a higher grade energy, can be used for more stuff. The "exchange rate" between the two is a typical diesel plant efficiency. Ballpark that at 1/3, and you can say that electrical energy use in the mining should be compared to 27.8 MW.
