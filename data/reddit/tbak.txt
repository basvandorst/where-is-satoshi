I just tried the link and it seems to work fine. Maybe bitbucket was down for a few minutes?
@_date: 2014-05-22 09:26:47
This is excellent! What a great way to help the Bitcoin community! :)
@_date: 2014-09-03 05:26:17
[Bitcoin Video Casino]( has provably fair craps and some other games. We've been around for a couple years and we are legit. :)
@_date: 2017-03-26 10:47:53
Fuck it! We'll do both! 
@_date: 2016-12-31 05:04:22
Yup this is a good way to check that a request doesn't happen too often. But this code will trash your CPU % since it will run through that loop millions of times while checking the current time. You probably should add a sleep command after each iteration for at least a few seconds. I think it's called Thread.sleep() in java.

Thanks for the comment! Yeah you're right that Satoshidice is very popular, and it's perfect for what it aims to do. But it's not really a game but more of a Bitcoin money-odds conversion tool. We're hoping that we can bring more fun to gambling games with a website like this. If you have any ideas how we can make our website enjoyable for more people, either by adding features or fixing issues, we'd love to hear them.
@_date: 2012-12-20 03:17:02
Nice profit! :)
A volume slider is an excellent idea. We never even thought about adding that. I think with the JavaScript library we're using it should be a piece of cake to add.
@_date: 2012-12-20 03:27:09
In the withdrawal popup we could automatically fill in the destination address text with the originating Bitcoin address text. Would something like that work? Or do you think a specific "cash out to original address" button would be better?
@_date: 2012-12-20 05:23:28
My friend is looking into updating our Bitcoin code to get the originating address from a transaction. Hopefully we will have this feature implemented soon!
Sure, feel free to PM me any questions you'd like.
@_date: 2012-12-22 06:06:09
Yeah taking the latest detected address makes sense.
Maybe there should be a checkbox "send to originating address", which, when clicked, will fill in the address field as well as display some warning text about first testing the address with a small amount before withdrawing everything. SatoshiDice displays a similar warning.
@_date: 2012-12-20 03:24:06
Wow thanks for the nice compliment! That's great to hear!
We thought it would be a good idea to let the user choose where to withdraw his winnings, in case he maybe forgot from where he initially sent his Bitcoins, or has changed his Bitcoin address since depositing. We could automatically fill in the withdrawal dialog with the originating address, so the user would just have to type in the BTC amount. Would something like that be better? Or do you think it's important that users can ONLY return winnings to the originating address?
@_date: 2012-12-19 19:46:05
Thanks! Be sure to let us know what you think! We are trying to make this a quality website, so any suggestions you have would be very useful.
@_date: 2012-12-20 03:32:52
Haha yup, just like Vegas! :)
We spent a lot of time making this site look as legitimate and polished as possible. We both have 10+ years experience working as programmers in the video game industry, so we know how important and time consuming polish is.
@_date: 2012-12-21 05:04:34
Thanks, yeah, that's a good point. While trying to implement this feature, we are starting to realize that it is not always guaranteed that the return address will work at all. For example, the return address displayed if I make a transaction from my coinbase test account is a Bitcoin address that is not at all familiar to me. The funds do come back to my account, but there's no way of knowing simply by looking at the address whether it would happen.
@_date: 2017-05-31 06:16:15
Thanks for the informative post. :)
What can an asset manager that charges fees actually do better than doing a little bit of homework yourself and investing in low-fee index funds? For example, the Vanguard target retirement funds are probably sufficient for most people that are investing for retirement. Most actively managed mutual funds do worse than a simple S&amp;P 500 index fund. Why would assets that are actively managed (for a percentage fee) expect to do better?
I have spoken to an asset manager and he recommended mutual funds that have a 5% up-front sales charge (!!!) and 2% in yearly fees. Completely ridiculous.
@_date: 2016-05-10 00:56:25
I think you may be confusing a Roth IRA with a regular IRA account. A Roth IRA is funded using money that has already been taxed (income tax most likely). If you hold on to this account until you retire, you can then withdraw without paying any additional taxes on your gains.
@_date: 2017-05-11 03:26:39
I'm pretty sure that transaction explorers such as blockcypher will tell you if the transaction has invalid signatures. That's an easy thing to check.
The reason why a confirmation is so important is that there will otherwise always be a chance that the coins are double spent. There could be a second secret transaction, that uses the same coins, which actually makes it onto the blockchain. The first transaction that you verified then becomes worthless.

At 0:30 the order book suddenly has a giant sell order. Check out the green/red lines in the bottom display.
@_date: 2017-05-06 05:27:10
Check out [bip32]( for your brainwallet. It uses a slow hash so it's much harder to crack. You can also create multiple addresses using a single passphrase, so you can create a new change address for every transaction if you'd like.
To actually use the coins, check out [coinbin]( You can create a new transaction with your private key, and then specify all of the inputs and outputs. So any leftover coins can either go to a new change address or your original input address.
You can use something like [blockcypher]( to confirm that the transaction looks good (didn't accidentally include a 100 BTC miner's fee), and then finally push it to the network.
Make sure that your passphrase is actually 100% random. People have been burned by this many many times already. Something like [diceware]( might be a good idea.
@_date: 2017-05-10 04:27:59
You could use a service like [blockcypher]( to check the transaction. They show a confidence % for unconfirmed transactions.
But to be really safe it's best to wait for 1 confirmation. :)
@_date: 2013-02-20 04:54:18
Yeah that video poker text should not be there... Thanks for letting me know. :)
We are trying to make every game 99.5% expected return. You are right that in a regular game of single-zero Roulette the expected return is 97.3%. To compensate, we then contribute 2.2% to the progressive jackpot, which boosts the expected return to 99.5%. If you click on the green text that says "99.5% expected return", a dialog pops up explaining this. Maybe this is not clear enough? Perhaps there is a better way we could show this information?
@_date: 2013-09-03 04:44:05
Hello I'm one of the developers. We've tested our site on a few Android phones and an iPad and all the games run OK. We also have a native Android app that currently supports Video Poker, Blackjack and Slots. The app will give you a much smoother mobile experience.
@_date: 2013-10-01 18:54:16
That's a good question. About a month before the attack we had disabled cloudflare for a few days, which could have exposed our IP address. We're just speculating here, but perhaps if they were able to identify our machine in some other way when they created the phoney HostBill request to install the KVM device, they wouldn't need the IP address.
@_date: 2013-10-02 14:16:56
You're welcome! :)
@_date: 2013-10-01 19:45:58
The kernel log showed that a physical device had been connected to our server. So that was a huge red flag right there. The auth log showed that some random user was able to log into our machine. It also showed that someone had logged into our machine while we were unable to connect to it for those few hours.
I'm not sure if there's reliable software that can automatically scan for issues like this. Does anybody know? I'd be worried that it might miss something...
@_date: 2013-10-02 09:38:53
Yes we only maintain a small amount of Bitcoins in our hot wallet. Most of our Bitcoins are in cold storage.
@_date: 2013-02-23 10:31:54
Ahhh OK, I understand now. Yeah, I cansee it being annoying that you can't withdraw small amounts. We can look into getting rid of that minimum withdrawal size.
@_date: 2013-06-08 19:40:08
Thanks for the compliment! :)

Thanks for the compliment! It's a bit of a relief to hear that the roulette game is just as cool as the other games... :) If you have any suggestions on how to improve the site, I'd love to hear them!
@_date: 2013-02-23 09:58:22
Thanks so much for all the nice words! It's so wonderful to hear that people are really enjoying the site. :)


I'm a bit confused about this. If you click CASH OUT, there's a checkbox that says "withdraw entire balance". So you can check that and withdraw all your funds. We're looking into letting you withdraw funds before getting your deposit confirmations, in which case you withdrawal will become pending, and will then automatically be sent when confirmations are done. That way you don't need to wait for confirmations before being able to withdraw.
Yeah, we could maybe have lower bet amounts.
You're maybe right that the tweet button might be too much. We thought it'd be cool if you got a nice hand and wanted to brag to your friends about it. When we have some free time we'll look into how many people actually use those buttons, and figure out if we should keep them.


Ah yeah, that's a little weird. It should clear when you go back to that page.
Thanks again for the compliments and suggestions! :)
@_date: 2013-10-01 18:54:31
You're welcome! :)
@_date: 2013-02-20 05:00:51
Thanks for the comments.
Yeah it might help a lot if the deuces have some kind of special marking to make them stand out.
Letting the user switch deck art is also something we've thought about. One concern is that there are already a zillion buttons along the bottom of the screen, so a new user might be overwhelmed if there are even more. Yesterday a friend was telling me that they didn't know how to spin in Roulette because there were too many buttons. So we're trying our best to avoid additional confusion. Designing this stuff is hard!
If you click on the Users tab in the chat window, and then click on your user name, you'll see some stats for all the games played. You can see how many games you've played, your best poker hands, etc. Do you think there are other stats that would be useful here?
@_date: 2013-01-05 19:11:57
We have now added a volume slider to the latest version. Thanks for suggesting this!
@_date: 2013-02-19 16:57:02

HostBill is the client management, support + billing software that our server provider uses. Our server provider would use this software to issue maintenance requests for the servers. The hacker was somehow able to create a fake entry in the HostBill system that instructed a technician to take a physical KVM device and plug it into our server. Once the physical KVM device was plugged into our server, it then gave the hacker remote access to the machine. So really the hacker first had to find an exploit in HostBill, before beginning the actual hack on our server using the KVM device.
This HostBill software is apparently quite popular among server hosting providers, so it’s entirely possible that this exploit still exists, and many other servers are vulnerable to the same kind of attack.
@_date: 2013-10-01 18:50:36
Thanks! We hope that it will help others...
@_date: 2013-01-05 19:11:03
Hello! Just wanted to say that we have now added this feature to our site. Thanks so much for your suggestion!
@_date: 2013-10-01 14:34:33
Thanks... Apparently other hackers are also finding ways to attach KVMs to unsuspecting servers.
@_date: 2013-10-01 14:31:36
Thanks for the tip! We are not familiar with Mandos but it is definitely something that we'll take a look at.
We were thinking that for something as rare and scary as this hack attempt, we would be better off always manually inspecting and restarting everything, just to make sure that everything is OK. If we had automatically decrypted the drives after coming back online, it's possible that the hacker's script calling home could have then gained full access to our server.
@_date: 2013-10-01 18:50:16
Yes you are right that if we had just remounted the encrypted file system without first checking it out we could have been open to attack. We saw from the kernel and auth logs that something was amiss, so we were extra vigilant.
@_date: 2013-02-20 04:47:06
Hey cool! Thanks! If you need an image with different dimensions, just let me know and I'll try to get something together for you.

Developer of Bitcoin Video Casino here! Thanks for the interesting post. We have put a lot of work into making our site as fair as possible, so it’s great to discuss this issue here.
The exploits that you listed could certainly be used to cheat the user. However, the main problem with these exploits is that they can all be detected, and if that ever were to happen, it would be devastating for the trustworthiness of the site itself. A single definitive example of our site cheating the customer would destroy our image, and we would lose all our customers. Therefore, economically, it doesn’t make any sense for us to cheat.
The main reason why these exploits can be detected is that all network activity can be monitored using basic browser tools. For example, if you hit F12 in chrome and go to the network tab, you can inspect all data going to and from the server. With this information, you can directly detect whether something is amiss. Since we have an API available for all our games, it would be pretty easy for a person to write an automated script to play a few thousand games and detect that our server fudged the numbers on some of the games. If he could show that, our web site credibility would be destroyed.
I’ll try to address some of the exploits below!
**Hot Reading**
In this exploit, the client must send his seed value before the server sends the hash. This is the incorrect order of the provably fair transaction. The server must first send the server seed hash, and then the client is free to send any random number seed that it chooses. The server is then obligated to play through with that hand. If the client were to send the random seed value before getting the server hash, this would be easily detected in a network monitoring tool. This could also be detected by inspecting the client source code itself.
**Cold Deck**
In this exploit, the server could suggest a client seed that it knows will not win a big prize. However, since we make all our client javascript code available in readable form, it’s pretty easy to see in the code that the user’s client seed is being generated locally on the fly by a random number generator on the user’s machine. So just from code inspection one could see that this doesn’t happen. One could also inspect network data coming from the server to see if it is being used to generate the client seed. If so, there is evidence that the game is not fair.
This exploit tries to avoid detection by reporting a client seed that exchanges certain letters of the seed values with similar looking ones in order to avoid paying out what would have been a big prize. Although a human may not be able to detect this, a simple automated script that plays a few hundred games would easily detect that the seed values reported are not consistent. If a web site were caught doing something like this, it could not be attributed to a simple bug in the code, since it would obviously be direct manipulation of the seed value. Getting caught doing this would destroy the credibility of the site.
**Controlled Secret**
This exploit tries to compromise the RNG on the client’s machine by injecting malicious javascript code after the initial batch of javascript has been sent. This exploit can be detected by checking network activity to see if new malicious code has been sent to the user. It can also be detected by verifying that the client seed values that the user’s browser is sending are consistent with its original random number generator.
If the web site is timing out on people, customers will eventually give up on the site and move to more reliable casinos. So it’s economically not a great idea to do this. One way to prevent this exploit would be to have the server resend the same server hash value if your game was not complete. That way, if the server stalls, you refresh your browser, and then you are given the same seed values again. If the server then continued to stall constantly on that same game, you would know that something is amiss. Bitcoin Video Casino doesn’t resend the same server seed value if you refresh in the middle of a game, but it is certainly something that we could add, if it would make people feel more at ease playing our games. We let people play with multiple browser windows open at the same time, so it might be a little tricky to implement that without all windows playing the same game, but I’m sure we could figure it out! :)
I hope these answers were helpful!
@_date: 2013-10-02 07:38:12
Yes our server provider said that they have reported the issue to HostBill.
@_date: 2013-10-02 07:36:55
Thanks, this is a good idea. We will include links to our FAQ on our next server update.
@_date: 2013-02-20 07:34:25
Yeah, we could maybe have some sort of running session counter... We'll have to think a bit about where we could squeeze that in.
I'm just adding the finishing touches to the deuces wild special cards, so that should be up real soon. Thanks again for that suggestion.
You're right that the deck art is very plain jane. We tried to copy the old-school video poker machines in Vegas as much as possible, but I can see how that art could turn people off. And, yeah, it's not clear at all that we have more poker game modes. We'll have to think a little more about how we can make that more obvious.
Thanks again for your feedback!
@_date: 2013-09-04 05:42:09
Yes you're absolutely right that with the mobile app you lose some of the provably fair ability, since there is no way to monitor network traffic from within the app itself. Maybe there is some kind of Android tool available that can monitor all network traffic?
The mobile app uses the same API as the web site, so if the API that the web site is using can be demonstrated to be provably fair, then the mobile app by extension should be provably fair. The API is available for anyone to use at  if anyone is interested.
We have been planning to release the Android app as open source in the near future. This way people can verify that the app does in fact use the API, so that should help a lot with provably fair. People can then also be assured that the app doesn't do malicious things, such as "phone home" a user's private information.
I'll be sure to post on Reddit when the app becomes open source! A cool thing with this is that people can then take the source, modify the app a little, add their own referral code, and then start making money from releasing a new version of the app.

We should have the text errors fixed real soon. Haha you're right that the web site is a big explosion of colors... so that does make it hard to identify what is a clickable link. The always-underline idea could work...
What happens to the progressive pot when you win is a little different depending on the game played.
* Video poker, bet 5 credits @ 0.01 = reset to 40 BTC
* Roulette = reset to 20 BTC
* Blackjack = reset to 1 BTC (we are considering boosting this to 20 BTC)
@_date: 2013-04-17 19:16:44
Thanks for the suggestions! We pay out an expected return of 99.5% for all games, and we pay up to 25% of house edge in referral bonuses, so there's unfortunately not much left to give out in promotions and incentives. We're hoping that the progressive jackpots are a good motivation for users to play.
We'd love to have a strong PR campaign to show that everything is good -- do you have any suggestions of who could help with this? We are programmers and artists on the team so we don't know much about marketing and promotion.
@_date: 2013-06-08 09:59:45
You're right that it would be silly for every person to manually analyze every game played. I think the main idea is that not every person needs to analyze every hand in order for the casino to be deemed fair. As long as one scrupulous person can run a few tests and definitively prove that the site is cheating, then the entire casino becomes invalid and all customers will leave.
For what it's worth, the user's browser automatically analyzes every game played to make sure that the server and client seeds and the game itself all check out. In the javascript file for each game is a function called check_game() that analyzes each game. If something doesn't check out, a dialog box will pop up explaining that something is incorrect.
At our site we've tried our best to be completely fair and transparent about everything that we do. I'm curious if you have any suggestions for how we can make the site even more trustworthy. Is there some additional technique we can use to ensure the user that everything we are doing is 100% fair?
@_date: 2013-03-14 03:28:32
Thanks for the nice words! Glad to hear you like our newest game. :)
It is possible to get an explanation of the progressive pays on the site. We added this a couple weeks ago. If you click on the "expected return" link on the left side of the screen, you'll see a popup that explains where all of the bets go. For example, in Roulette, there is a 97.3% expected return from the game itself. We then contribute 2.2% to the progressive jackpot, so that the user's expected return is boosted to 99.5% (the minimum for all our games). Similarly, when a user plays the roulette side game, we make sure that the expected return is at least 99.5% by contributing everything else to the prizes and the progressive jackpot.
@_date: 2013-02-20 07:45:07
Cool! Please let me know if you have any comments or suggestions! Our roulette game is lightning fast, so you should be able to quickly play many games. Also, if you happen to be a programmer, we have an API that you can use to directly program your strategy into a roulette playing bot.
@_date: 2013-10-01 16:44:52
Your description is exactly what happened. The hacker couldn’t log in at the terminal, so he rebooted and mounted the boot partition. Then he inserted his trojan and waited for us to unlock those disks.
You are right that the boot partition was unencrypted. Sorry we didn’t make that clear. We could have encrypted that as well but it is particularly annoying to do so on a remote boot machine. All of the stuff that mattered to us and our users (Bitcoin, source code, mysql, apache, etc) was all on encrypted partitions.
@_date: 2013-10-01 18:51:35
We rent dedicated servers. If we owned our own servers and hosted them ourselves this attack would not have been possible.
@_date: 2013-10-01 19:51:27
We ran "top" and saw that /etc/bitcoin.sh was running, which is not anything we had written. This process had been started by a cron job that he had added to our machine.
@_date: 2013-03-06 06:48:47
Developer here! Every game that you play is automatically verified. If somehow the server and client don't agree on something, you will see a popup dialog. This makes it impossible for the game to try to cheat with the dice, since the user would know. There is also a verify button that you can press to manually check the random number generator for each game that you have played. On the web site there's a link explaining how this provably fair stuff works if you'd like to learn more.
If you have some free time, please try a few games of craps and let me know what you think! If you'd like some Bitcoins to try it out I can set you up with an account with some credits.
@_date: 2013-10-01 16:45:43
OK will do! Thanks. :)
@_date: 2013-01-05 19:09:21
I just wanted to let you know that we took your advice and implemented the "Return to sending address" feature for our site. In the cash out dialog box, if the user clicks a check box, the sending bitcoin address is auto-filled in the form and some warning text is displayed about first testing a small amount. Thanks again for your advice!
@_date: 2013-02-20 07:42:42
Yeah, we have this on our giant todo list... When we implement this, we want to make sure that it doesn't cause any confusion about what has happened to the user's credits. It makes me nervous on other Bitcoin gambling sites when I do a withdrawal, see my credits vanish, but then 10+ minutes go by before I see any credits in my target account. It'd be nice to see the pending state of the withdrawal somehow.
@_date: 2013-03-14 05:10:15
Yeah maybe the payout info could be moved to the help button. That might be a better location. It's really hard to know what kind of UI will make the most sense to people... :)
@_date: 2013-02-21 13:25:33
Glad you had a good time on the site! :)
