There are smaller peaks that also occur with a given log-periodicity.
@_date: 2018-09-05 07:03:45
I know what you mean, it is called logistic curve. When you look at my curve in a log-linear plot you can see the tapering off, here for example:
@_date: 2018-09-04 01:26:41
I don't say that the plotting is difficult but that the meaning is remarkable. Did you ever even think to plot BTC price on a log log chart? Also did you think to use the Genesis Block as your starting point? When you see the fact that the behavior of BTC is regularized and it is basically a straight line, it gives me shivers. If this doesn't do that to you, you don't understand physics and math. Sorry. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 01:58:48
You are the one, confusing log-linear with a log-log graph. The only stupid thing here is me engaging with a full of himself troll. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 00:27:42
That is good, thank you for the validation result. BTC is very interesting indeed. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 10:27:40
Ok, here I created actually a log-periodic model with 2 harmonics. 
Still working on fitting, but here first attempt. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 01:11:38
It starts from that date because this is when you can find data online. Before that the data is not reliable and/or not easy to find. 
The fact you need to actually extrapolate backwards to make the power law work is also remarkable. If you don't get the amazing information there is in the graph, just look the damn thing, you probably don't understand what I'm talking about. 
There are at least 5 orders of magnitude in the graph and all fall along a straight line. Do you get what that means? 
@_date: 2018-09-04 16:27:28
Yeah, he is right about BTC going to 100s of K or 1M but not in 2021, he is off by several years. I sent him the chart and asked what he thinks, he never answered.  
@_date: 2018-09-04 22:34:06
Thank you for the validation results. Doing the analysis with out of sample data is a very good step.  I also suspect that we just saw in December may be the earliest of the 2 peaks we see in the other bubbles. We will see. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 16:32:43
The next huge surge, comparable with the ones we saw before (December for example) will be in 9.5 years from now. Before that we should see a crash, at about 5.4 years from now. We may have smaller events before then but everything is slowing down, scaling up but slowing down. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 02:40:27
On the contrary. An exponential curve grows and doesn't taper oiff, while a power law in time tapers off because it grows slower and slower. Here how the same chart looks like if you plot it in a semilog chart:
@_date: 2018-09-04 22:37:41
Welcome, it is was fun to share with others. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 09:11:28
Yes, I agree. I will try to see if there is a pattern in number of wallets or transactions as a function of time. It should be a proxy for number of users. If know how users grow we can go from time to users, to users to price. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 16:17:23
Ok, I will dot that. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 00:34:44
Troll in the name, so I should not even answer but let's try to educate you. It is a power law because when you plot it in a log-log graph it is clearly a straight line trend. You can fit it with a regression curve (red line). The fit gives you a R^2 of 0.92, that means 92 % of the behavior of the data can be explained by the regression model. 
It has predictive power. You could have fit it 1 year ago and predict where the general trend of BTC would have been right now. 
I made predictions because the general trend will continue. 
As the system scales up it is extremely unlikely it will deviate from the behavior that it followed for 10 years. 
By the way I have a PhD in physics, and all the grad classes for a master in math. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 06:24:01
No, but because it is a log-log plot, not a log-linear plot it is actually flattening in time. It is not obvious from chart but basically it takes longer and longer to scale up to next order of magnitude. Of course at at a point the pattern will break completely and we will see a phase transition. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 15:41:51
It is oscillatory in the sense that we can tell when next big bubble is going to happen and even when the price will deviate from the trend. The bubble peaks are clearly log-periodic. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 07:02:35
Not sure, probably not, it is common to have log in the y axis but I never saw a commercial chart platform with log in the x axis. Simply most assets do not behave log-periodically. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 00:27:02
Not yet, work in progress. I will update when I do, thank you for your comments. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 04:12:28
The peaks are predictable actually. They are equally spaced on log-log chart. This means it takes longer and longer in linear time. Let me do that you are suggesting but using trend and where I think next peaks will be based on regularity I see. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 01:57:24
Ok, troll. Waste of time from my side to try to be reasonable with you. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 07:05:03
And as time goes by it will flatten even more, to be practically flat in 30-40 years, that makes sense. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 04:16:47
@_date: 2018-09-06 04:53:10
Again you are thinking of a log-linear chart, like what happens with S&amp;P 500 over several years. This is a log-log chart, if anything it says BTC is stablilzying over longer period of time. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 06:28:22
Why this chart is different from other charts you think you have seen before: it is not a log-linear plot. Many people maybe have seen BTC price plotted in a log-linear plot (log on y axis, linear on the x axis). Chart doesn't look like that, it is not linear when you do that. It maye be somehow exponential (linear in a log-linear chart) over few years but it is doesn't follow a unique pattern over 10 years (since BTC was created). When you see a linear trend in a log-log chart you are dealing with a power law, not an exponential. I never saw a chart that showed clearly this power law behavior (and I saw a lot of models trying to explain BTC behavior). There are many consequences if this pattern holds to be true to further analysis. Power laws are important in nature and man made phenomena. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 01:47:37
It is not a log-linear for god sake. It is a log-log plot. It is a complete different beast. If you don't give a shit about people that have worked on this for years then, sorry for you. Do you know who is the most successful hedge fund manager? A mathematician. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 05:25:25
Yes, I think you are on the right track.

@_date: 2018-09-04 16:13:03
Old is relative, : P. Python is good for intensive applications (we use it for trading with my team, developer is a Python guy). I use MatLab because it is faster to code and it has a lot of nice graphic and signal analysis tools. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 22:37:02
Physics can be applied to non deterministic systems. You don't get the pinpoint accuracy of classical mechanics but you still can tell many general properties of the system. The pattern that I have shown has been consistent for 10 years. Also see some of the comments where people are reproducing my results trying to take a segment from past and predicting a following one (basically trying to simulate predicting the future) and the model seems predictive. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 17:33:59
The one you are showing me is a log-linear chart and I explained in the beginning of the post how the chart I'm showing is different. Notice for example the other poster only fits since 2012, I go back to 2010 with black line chart and actually I extrapolate all the way to 2009 to create the fit. If you plot BTC price on a log-linear plot you will see that it is not a straight line, it is at some points but then the slope changes, there is not a unique slope. Contrary to exponential trend that grows faster and faster what I'm showing is that BTC is slowing down and it will take longer and longer to scale up. I think this is a new result, at least, demonstrated in this particular way (using a power law in time). 
@_date: 2018-09-04 07:27:50
LOL, the chart says otherwise and people make tons of money on the market using algo trading that looks at patterns from the past to make statistical predictions of future behavior of stocks and other assets. Do not use trite sentences you are copying from other people. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 01:15:44
That is so absurd. Why do you think people do regression studies at all? Or why do you think there is an entire field of statistics? Because you WANT TO MAKE PREDICTIONS !!! 
Entire industries are based on these predictions. Science is all about taking data from the past and estrapolate to the future. In mechanics these predictions are super precise and deterministic, in stats they are statistical meaning you can "predict" as a probablitiy measure not exactly. For example, this chart doesn't tell you what the price will be exactly in 1 day or even a month. It tells you though there is a general trend and it reveals that there are profound forces at plays. Please see video I link above. It is very instructive. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 16:10:59
No, not yet. I want to go back and do some of these more sophisticated studies using residuals and other way to validate the power law and the fit. I just wanted to share with community what I have so far because it is interesting. Thank you for reference. Sorniette is also a master in these type of analysis applied to financial markets. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 00:19:49
Power laws are very common in complex phenomena.  The growth of cities, river systems, networks and so on. The fact that BTC followed a power law for 10 years it means is not a normal financial asset. It is a much more interesting and complex system. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 03:08:36
I think I understand why you are so confused. You think a log-linear and a log-log chart are the same thing. I'm going to comment here so other people can understand. 
There are some assets that momentarily are exponential, and there are some reasons for that. If you plot them in log-linear or semilog chart the plot looks more or less like a line. 
But this is a log-log chart. 
You have a power law when you see a straight line in a log-log chart. 
Power laws are interesting phenomena. I tried to point out links so you can see why they are interesting and relevant. It means there are other forces at play here, for example networks, and in particular financial evaluation of networks are based on power laws. 
This for example could be an answer to what people say, when they say BTC has not value. You can answer easily, it follows the laws of a network, for example Metcalfe, Zipf's laws (check them out).
If indeed the valuation of BTC is a power law, people are assigning value to BTC exaclty as scientists predicted networks would be valued. It is very interesting and imporant. It is one of the example where network valuations are not just theoretical but they do have a real value in currencies people us (like USD). 
I could write an entire book on this. And maybe I will when I have time. But please do not lecture on things you think you understand but you don't. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 15:59:32
Yes, full model here: 
@_date: 2018-09-04 03:12:27
It is MatLab, not R. How many lines of code is irrelevant. By the way original code has many more lines because I did hundred of analysis about BTC and other crypto. This is just one of the results. Please inform yourself on power laws. You will learn something. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 02:59:58
By the way here is the behavior of NASDAD 100 stocks in a log-log chart (that is different from log-linear) over 4 year period. No stock behaves like BTC. 
It is difficult to find stocks that grew as fast as BTC so comparison is a little unfair but still you can see behavior at different scales is not self similar that is what I'm trying to show here. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 01:34:14
It is so sad that there are trolls like you on the internet. I don't want to make it personal but please make meaningful comments. Go and do the study yourself, get back and tell me what could be wrong and why what I'm showing is not meaningful. Plotting data on a log-log (not lin-log like you claim) is a known way to identify possible power laws in data. Now it is just a necessary and not sufficient way to determine if we are dealing with a real power law and further studies are needed but it is still incredible that there is a precise pattern that linkd size and time of growth of the BTC price. I have discussed with people that are much more experience than you in this field (you took a class, lol), that do data analsys every day for a living and they do agree with me that the graph is remarkable. If you have questions I will be glad to answer but not dealing with trolling easily. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 16:00:21
It has done the same thing for 10 years. I never saw a chart that showed BTC behavior so consistent over such period of time. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 03:18:00
Did I say, I'm the first one? At the same time do you know of any other post that shows this? Please do not show me log-linear, it is not the same than log-log. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 01:19:23
By the way, the graph above is not the only study I have done on BTC, cryptocurrencies and financial markets. I'm showing just one of the results. I have examined this in depth. I invite you to do the same if you have some math and analytical skills. I do data science for a living, and I said this not to use my credentials to win an argument but to let you know it is not my first rodeo. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 04:10:08
Yes, it is related I think, that rule is more a rule of thumb what I'm showing is the real math behind that behavior. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 04:07:13
A semilog chart is really different from a log-log chart. Here I'm showing BTC scales up in a certain precise way in time. It is scale invariant. As it grows it slows down actually, an exponential curve, that is what you would have if you get a straight line in a semilog chart will make BTC explode given current rate of growth. Instead if you look historical behavior over its entire life then you can see that is much more organic growth. It is a different phenomenon that S&amp;P 500. Let me see if I can find 65 years of S&amp;P 500. I showed how stocks look like on a log-log chart here over 4 years, no stock behaves like BTC and even average of them does not : 
@_date: 2018-09-04 07:20:40
Lol, ok let me know if you want an explanation of anything, with interesting questions not BS. I had enough of trolling today. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 22:38:27
Yeah, not that long. What is good is that it is a more suistanable and credible growth. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 08:57:35
It might be not obvious but because it is on a log-log chart it tapers off eventually. It is slowing down. We have difficult time to think in log times. Here what you get when you plot the same graph on a log-linear chart. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 01:43:44
If you understand math please read this. It explains the relevance of power laws and how to identify them. A log-log plot (not a log-linear) is a one of the methods. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 07:15:53
Here (see second picture, second panel). I subtracted the price from trend so you can see the periodicity of the peaks. The major peaks are evenly spaced, so they are log-periodic. 
Just one of the peaks, around 3.35, is questionable, but it is where a peak should have been if pattern before and after would have been repeated. You can see there is a mini-peak, maybe a failed bull? 
@_date: 2018-09-04 04:55:28
Thanks. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 04:57:08
By the way here is a graph of how an exponential trend would look like on different type of charts. I'm using log-log. As you can see an exponential trend (S&amp;P 500 for example without adjusting for inflation), would not look like a straight line in a log-log plot. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 01:42:19
I already told you a 1000 times it is not a log-linear graph !!! The fact you repeat that it means you don't get it. It is a log-log plot. It shows a straight line on a log-log plot, not log-linear it is an enormous difference. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 15:48:45
There is a log periodicity of 3.1. I used in this chart to model the peaks, but also I showed above there are smaller peaks at same periodicity. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 01:28:29
Please look online for Metcalfe's law. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 16:03:12
We can try to do that but aas you notice it is not a big deal given the log-log scale. Good observation about Metcalfe. It turns out actually BTC follows an exponent of 1.7 relative to users rather than 2 as in Metcalfe. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 16:16:05
Exactly, I was surprised myself. Many people if anything will imagine that we are scaling up faster and faster, this means the opposite, we are scaling up but slower and slower and with a definite pace that is there since day 1. I don't know of any other asset that does that. I know Sorniette has some paper where he sees log-periodicities during bubbles and during what he calls anti-bubbles. But they are temporary, just before or after a crash, not on time scales of 10 years. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 07:36:01
In 1 year price baseline will be 10 K. I know it is disappointing but basically it means it really will not go down much from that. BTC is going up and not down, it may take longer than people thought (also it can reach momemtarily really high values in a bubble) but it has done the same thing for 10 years, even what it seems a bear year so far it is not, we are simply going back to general trend. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 05:30:57
This is important because so many people use the old trite "BTC has no intrinsic value", it is not backed by government. You can argue as much as you want but if indeed BTC value is a scale invariant phenomenon, if it follows these networks valuation laws, then it is maybe the first time we have a global decentralized real example of a network that has a precise, predictable value. I saw some article that claimed FB valuation followed Zip'f law. That is interesting but it is still a centralized network so it is interesting to compare with BTC (I will when I have time) because then we will have an argument of what the market considers the more valuable global network. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 16:04:57

What is the point man? That your growth stopped? I'm telling you that of course there are processes that control the growth of systems. For you it was a joke that wanted to communicate something, but I'm telling you that the comment you made had a kernel of truth and some limitations. There is a reason why I'm excited about this. Do you want to please learn something interesting? Look at this TED talk, then come back and comment again, you will learn something:
@_date: 2018-09-04 03:21:42
Ok, I can do that. Value of entire network is indeed market cap so you are right but I think result would be very similar. Let me try. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 23:43:37
Bitcoin is going up and up and up on a log-log plot. 
It is a power law.
@_date: 2018-09-04 16:08:10
Right, exactly, that is what you see, this why you see periodicities around 3.1 but it is not perfect because it is not always 3.1, the period is longer, I can include modelling of this too. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 00:14:57
What it means that the pattern is very precise and predictable (even the bubble peaks occur in a predictable manner). But contrary to what many people think major scaling up (over orders of magnitude), for example going from  1 to 10 to 100 to 1000 and so on, takes longer and longer. You can use formula in the title to calculate what BTC value will be in few years from now. For example, BTC will be around 150 K in 2025, 400 K in 2028, and 1.5 M in 2033.  
@_date: 2018-09-04 03:53:06
Yep. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 09:00:33
The next huge drawdown is in 5 years and the next large bubble in 9.5 years, BTC will be in the oder of several 100 K by then. 
Let's revisit the post in 10 years, lol. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 01:23:34
There is a reason the process stopped right? If you plotted your height you would see that at point it slowed down and then stopped. I'm saying this is going on forever but the fact BTC scaled up over long period of time in a very regular fashion is meaningfull. I also said it is slowing down, not accelerating but also it seems it has a lot of room to grow, there are no major deviation from the line, only temporary ones (bubbles and drawdowns). 
@_date: 2018-09-04 04:01:49
Also I will try to plot commodities on a log-log chart and see if we notice same power law behavior, I doubt it. Stocks, as I showed above, do not show the same scale invariant behavior of BTC.  I'm looking at Bitcoinity and their cap data is not good (price data is fine), I could interpolate it (missing days for some reason) but looking for better data source. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 19:51:39
Path to 1 M:
In the following link (see attached), I plot same graph, with log-periodicity pattern, expressed x axis linearly and in years (instead of log of days, you lose the easy to see power law pattern, but humans understand better linear time) and made prediction to 1 M (11 years from now).

It is remarkable the model fits so well and consistently and goes back all the way to Genesis Block. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 17:56:08
It is extremely clear. You need to plot the price in a log chart and then fit it with linear regression. You get a R=0.89 that is a pretty good damn fit for financial data. It is clear exponential growth. There are also very regular oscillations with a period of 7 months that make the price swing up and down about the general trend, but that is noise not the signal.

A lot of misinformation. Transaction charts shows that transactions have been at the same volume than in January in average. Go and check the transactions numbers in blockchain.org. They should have climbed up but for sure they have not climbed down in general. 
@_date: 2014-07-23 13:31:54
He is right. Everything. 
Make exchanges decentralized so there is not a third party in charge of customer funds. You can still create a business model around this by facilitating the interactions between peers with a good interface. 
This is just an example. We need to focus on the core feature of BTC that is decentralization. 
Decentralization cannot be regulated. This is the way to escape the bully abuse of banks puppets like Lawsky. 
@_date: 2014-06-06 00:22:00
Not sure what you are talking about. I just told you that is understandable there are fluctuations on price in real data. The long term trend is clearly exponential. Any professional data analyst can confirm so. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 18:06:12
Financial and social data are not textbook mathematical curves. It is absurd to expect that. When somebody says a real life trend follows a certain pattern it means within a certain error. As I explained above the fit between a perfect exponential pattern and real data is very good. It is not the full model. A full model would also include the oscillations I talked about. I made such model and the fit is even better. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 04:29:57
Ok, I will .

Don't you realize that these kind of events are catastrophic for the crypto community? It is not a malicious party against another. It is something that involved 70,000 users and almost 5000 BTC. This is when, as a community, we should support each other. This is when we can get positive news about applications of BTC and value of a public ledger. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 23:06:47
Price should be higher at this time if BTC follows trend line and previous bubble pattern. It should be already in the 800. It is not because of the negative news about the sale, it has not recovered yet from that.  
@_date: 2014-07-02 23:09:22
It is easy to see when price of BTC is inflated. If you make a plot of number of users of BTC versus price they correlate very well. If you draw a trendline for number of users any time the number of users is below the trendline BTC is oversold and when the number of users is above trendline (like during a bubble) BTC is overbought. Right now BTC is oversold. 
@_date: 2014-07-04 02:45:32
The model (black curve) is based on the following steps:
1) Use a logistic model of number of users of BTC from blockchain.info (proxy of real numbers but ok). Graph of logistic model not shown here. 
2) Assume 1 billion users for saturation point of number of users.
3) Derive from empirical data relationship between price and number or users (according to network theory). Observed relationship with R=0.92--&gt; price=C*users^1.4
4) Use Fourier Analysis to detect periodicities of bubbles. Use 4 main peaks in the spectrum to determine frequencies. 
5) Add sine waves oscillation with above determined frequencies (and phases) to price trend model described in 1-3. 
Days are from Bitstamp opening. 
Red line is a simple exponential fit. Black curve is complete model.

If the OPEC countries adopt this they could raise the cap in a matter of days. Better though if the start to invest slowly and make the market grow in few months or years (faster though that what BTC would do by itself).

I can post different graphs for different number of users. But in general it doesn't really matter when you talk about exponential growth if you are off by a factor of few. What matters is order of magnitude. It would make a difference to go from 1 to 10 billion.

Whoever was thinking that somebody was going to buy 30 K of BTC to dump them on the market is an idiot. Market reacting to these stupid news and bringing price down is nuts.

There are ways to see the trend but you need to use real math, not bs TA.

You are wrong. Exchange is the vulnerability of the system right now. If we had already decentralized ones this would not have happened in the first place. 
It is right that the thief gets back the same service he gave to many others. The BTC do not belong to him. 
@_date: 2014-10-20 15:01:27
It has nothing to do with the blockchain. Exchanges can decide if to stop coins that are proven to come from or to go to a suspect account. 
@_date: 2014-07-04 03:14:04
Let's see if the model holds for the next bubble or two. In that case I can tell you the next peak will be at the end of July according to model. But it seems that real price is shifting slightly relatively to model so it could happen sometime in August. It should reach few thousands. The model is actually pretty good when you take trend line and you subtract local mean of price. The fit is pretty amazing with the exception of the last few weeks when price went crazy due to sale of 30 K BTC. But now price is going back to follow model closely.

Completely idiotic. We need any publicity we can get. Write your own articles if you don't like them. I find them very informative. And I read a lot on the topic.

Yes, log of price in dollars. 1=10, 2=100, 3=1000, 4=10,000, etc. 
@_date: 2014-07-29 06:33:31
The 214 days from the last peak is already gone. It should have happened few days ago. The previous bubbles were very regular, extraordinary so but the pattern is broken.

Exchanges are outside the blockchain. The thief Ryan Gentle and other crooks like him take advantage of this vulnerability of BTC.  So it is fair and symmetric that the same service is reserved to fix the problem they created in the first place. Seizing Ryan funds is acceptable in this case given the egregious action, the number of users impacted and the damage to BTC credibility. The day we have functional decentralized exchanges we would not have this problem.

A=5.6898e-18  
C=3.5751  
alpha1=5.9083  
futY=1; number of years from now  
time1=10^C+365*futY  
Price can be calculated as:   
P1=A*time1^alpha1, price in dollars  
You can use this formula to predict trendline price. During bears price goes about 50 % below and during bulls price can go 10X higher then trend.

Whoever votes down, doesn't understand power laws. It is your problem. Read the book Scale, by physicist G. West. But probably you are not that kind of person you want to understand things. The purpose of this post is to show how incredible BTC is as an investment. Avoid the bubbles (that can be identified easily using this model) and just buy BTC a little at the time during the bear times (when price is below trend line). BTC will be 800 K in 10 years from now. 
We will see who is right.

Updated model to today. 
@_date: 2019-04-08 04:02:33
The main point of the graph is to show how precitablea the behavior has been so far. It is very predictable pattern over the entire history of BTC, basically from day 1. 
@_date: 2019-04-08 18:27:51
Yes, fixed link.
@_date: 2019-04-08 20:06:27
When you have a power law you can easily show it using a log-log graph. It shows as a straight line. For example, if you have y=A t^m, then log(y)=log(A)+m*log(t), and if you call log(y)=Y and log(t)=X and C=log(A), you get Y=C+m X, that is clearly a line and the slope is the power of the law. See my links above concerning the relevance of power law as universal phenomenon in economy, society and nature in general.
@_date: 2019-04-08 02:40:04
I don't think everybody appreciates what you are looking at when you see this graph. BTC is the only financial system in the world that behaves in this way, a precise power law (I didn't do a full analysis of other crypto but they too are not behaving exacly like BTC over long time scales).
I analyzed commodities, equities, forex and nothing behaves like this.
It has been theorized in the past that the economical value of a network can be calculated by the number of users in the system (see Metcalfe Law) and BTC is proving this is correct. It also shows that its value come from its fundamental nature of being a network. Adoption (that continues to grow) drives the price at its fundamental level. Yes you can have temporary oscillations (even the large bubbles are predictable and log periodic that is another fascinating property) but BTC has done the same thing for 10 years. You don't see this in the chart but the red line crosses the origin that is the Genesis block.
I even retroactively fit some of the earlier, pre-exchanges transactions. This trend is not due to chance. It is as predictable as any physical phenomenon can be.
If you want to educate yourself look at the topic of scale invariance, power law, critical systems.

Zipf's law?

No, close to 800 K. But when bubbles occur price can go up to 10 x the trend line.

@_date: 2019-04-08 19:04:15
Use this formula to know what the trendline price will be in a given number of years. 
futY=1; this is the number of years from now (substitute for any years you want). 
time1=365 * futY+10^C. Price can be calculated as: 
P1=A*time1^alpha1, gives the price in dollars.
You can use this formula to predict trendline price.
During bears price goes about 50 % below and during bulls price can go 10X higher then trend.
@_date: 2019-04-09 14:30:58
Thank you for the double space info. The % is from matlab (it used to denote comments, sorry I should have cleaned up). So it is just price in dollars. It is the same formula in the title without the oscillations, it gives the price of the main trendline. In bull markets we can go up to 10 x of that trendline and in bear markets 50 % below.
@_date: 2019-04-08 20:11:11
Not sure I undestand your second question. Of course the log-periodicity I indicated is approximate because we are still dealing with a probabilistic phenomenon. But you can see a clear pattern. There is a overall trend that covers 5 orders of magnitude and oscillations around this trendline. The price seems to go to 50 % the value in the trendline during bear market and it can reach up to 10 X during the bull market.
@_date: 2019-04-08 01:21:37
The formula is in the title. But basically were are dealing with a trending that is a power law, with power of about 6 in time (time in days since Genesis Block) and log periodic bubbles (cos of log of time). Th R^2 is 0.94 that is incredible for a financial system. 
@_date: 2019-04-09 14:34:11
Yes, you are right but the question is what is the saturation level? I think BTC has been adopted by a small % of the population. It is still in its early stages of adoption. I think there is space for 1 or maybe 2 levels of magnitude then we will seee some phase shift where the power law changes to smaller power and flatten the curve.
@_date: 2019-04-08 04:01:17
Ok, I will try. It is a good point. But for now x axis is days from January 2009 (Genesis block). It is the exponent, so 3.5 means 10^3.5. To get years divide by 365. On the y axis is price in USD, but again just the expoent so 10^3 is 1000 dollars. I will post here the formula. But basically it will take about 10 years to reach 1 M (baseline price). 
@_date: 2019-04-08 02:32:06
When you plot data in a log-log graph (log in x and log y) and you see a straight line, it means you are dealing with a power law. That is a remarkable fact. It has many implications. Basically BTC is doing the same thing it is doing since 10 years. Its main dynamics has not changed. 
@_date: 2019-04-08 18:28:29
Deleting graph?
@_date: 2019-04-09 14:49:24
Next I'm going to work on a model where I fit with users growth. Some other people showed that prices scales with a power law of users with power 1.6 (not quite the 2 predicted by Metcalfe). It should follow a logistic curve. One then can make an assumption about saturation levels, like 0.1 % of the world population, 1 % and so on. It will give ranges of possible scenarios.
@_date: 2019-04-08 18:36:29
That is strange. I don't get the error page. It shows the graph.
@_date: 2019-04-08 18:35:52
Do you see the graph? It is not broken for me.
@_date: 2019-04-09 14:42:53
It is called correlation coefficient. 
@_date: 2019-04-08 19:05:51
R^2 is the fit to the model. It is a statistical measure to tell how good the fit. A R^2 of 0.94 means the model accounts for 94 % of the the behavior seen in the data.
