As of right now in the U.S. spending bitcoin or selling it is a taxable item in terms of capital gains/losses. Anyone who tells you otherwise is committing tax fraud and at risk. That means you must record the USD value at time of disposal (or exchange) minus your cost basis for tax purposes. No matter how small. Huge headache but the state of it right now.
This is the main reason businesses do not want to accept it directly (as well as volatility) as they do not want to do this themselves. Companies like Starbucks coming up with alternate ways to allow by having it exchange to USD before they put it on their books gets around it but is still a taxable event for you when liquidated.
People really need to think about this carefully and the practicality at this time.

Actually it is regarding taxes unless specifically changed by Congress.

The first gold ETF was March of 2003 (not the 1960’s as stated). Your “homework” is completely wrong and puts serious questions as to the validity of your predictions.

A simple apology from you will suffice. However, seeing the history of your posts (racist, personal attacks, etc.) I will not hold my breath. Have a nice day.

“Us educated” says it all.

Obviously you did not read the linked IRS communication as it is very straight forward. If you choose to ignore that is up to you but don’t tell others incorrect information. It is not FUD in the slightest and only hope everyone enjoys capital gains from crypto. Just CYA by following the rules in the US.
The rest of your rant is nonsensical and mostly not related. Have a nice day.

Please stop spreading false information that could get people in trouble.

I said gain/loss. If you only have losses then no taxes obviously. Point is you still have to record it and if annual amount is a net gain you must pay taxes. You can also offset other capital gains (non bitcoin) with any losses but still have to report details. 
If ever audited you better have these detailed records for every transaction.

I really hope you never get audited my friend. The IRS probably will not accept your reasoning (assuming you are in the U.S.). My only reason for posting on this topic is to help people avoid serious issues by keeping good records via programs available (thanks eqleriq) or other means.

Wrong on all counts. Please see previous posts from person above and decide for yourself if worth listening to for anything.

Waiting for you on that. Big hugs to you today.

For the love of god and all that is left of education, “loose” = opposite of tight, “lose” = opposite of win. Please use them correctly. Have a nice day.

Let me put it simply, “institutions” (i.e. major banks, investment houses, etc.) are not buying bitcoin or any other coins. Only high risk hedge funds do that. They are however very interested in the transaction side and blockchain technology (not exclusive to bitcoin). They know getting a piece of every transaction is where the money is made.
They are putting some money into these areas more than anything else but conspiracy theorists like the ones in the video (trying to look like legit professors) draw the connections they want to see. I will also say from my experience Jamie Dimon is one of the smartest and most ethical people in the business. Along the lines of Warren Buffett. His views on bitcoin specifically were/are based on the unregulated aspect of it and not so subtle manipulations that he does not want JP Morgan to be associated with at this time.

Cryptogrip, you are usually very reasonable so please don’t take this as a slam. Having been in the finance business for over 30 years and knowing this group, don’t fall for their lines. They had great returns in 2017 and lured a lot of bad hedge funds into investing in early 2018 when they had large inflows.
They now are down almost 60% for the year and dying like many of the hedge funds who gave them money. In November or so they started putting out press releases that were picked up by many sources saying they had record inflows for the year. The truth is that was early in the year and are having massive outflows now. They are in serious trouble and trying to up their PR before they fold.
