It's all abstracted to fuck like everything is in the information age. There is no actual coin. There's just a ton of computers which all agree that your 'coin' is behind a certain number, and if you want to remove them from that number and move them to another number you need the private number that only you have. It just so happens that that private number is probably very very very very hard to obtain from just the public number.

You're being too broad, that's like saying that money never becomes outdated, which is probably won't, this is on about how a different type of money should overtake it.  What you're saying is equivalent to saying music will not become outdated, it won't, but different formats for it will.
The old methods of creating fire are outdated, do you rub sticks together now to make fire?  Or do you burn sticks etc. for heat?  I highly doubt it.


Wheels are constantly advancing, the wheels now are much more advanced than they were 100 years ago.


Metal tools do advanced though, e.g. from hand tools to power tools to computer controlled power tools.
No, but methods of generating it become more outdated.
Well if you're going to be using transistors which only allow for a half-pitch of 65nm (which was the most advanced in 2006) you're not going to be competing very well.

Would you agree then that there's no reason to think that a politician is more biased towards corporation/union/person who has donated lots of money to their campaign?  Of course not, the politician is going to favor their political opinions.
If I'm the one paying for the court, you honestly think the court is going to be equally fair to the person not paying them anything?  And biased courts are going to be favored.  If someone steals from you, would you go to the fair and balanced court, or the court which is much more likely to make you win?  Me and most people would go to the biased court.


I know there's not, but it's much less likely.  Why would the court be biased against me or the employer?  They would have no reason to.  The larger problem with state courts is more due to political bias, but what makes you think a private company would be immune there?

Is each block stored in its own file?  If so that is the problem, the xbox versions of the call of duty games are hell to move/copy when extracted because the files are all separate.
