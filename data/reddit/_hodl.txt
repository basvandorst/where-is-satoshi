You pay a fee to have your transaction committed to a block. Not sure how that is stealing.
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:23:34
You and me both. Once we implement the lightning network, maybe we can stop hearing all this BCH bullshit. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:23:43
Same seed on both. Maybe keep one at home and then carry one on you at all times in case you want to trade?
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:13:47
Do you have any pending transactions into the wallet that may not have 3 confirmations yet?
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:26:23
I switched today, but I'm waiting for my verification to finalize.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:14:35
Haha. No worries. Just trying to be helpful. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:26:05
May we have any hints other than female? Maybe country or something? I thought you may be DJ Booth, but I saw that got shut down on Twitter. I actually enjoy the way this giveaway is being done. I spent about 5-6 hours at work today googling in hopes of figuring this out.

Because it’s a store of wealth for me. I don’t want to use it to buy apples or games with. I just want to keep my money out of the hands of Wall Street and big banks.

And to be honest, I prefer the Huracan over the Aventador (I’m including the new Aventador S). I’ve been in both and the Huracan just feels like a better car, and I prefer the insane crackles the Huracan releases when you shift.

Depends on how you are taxed as well. In the USA, I’d be taxed on the sale and then would have less to rebuy in with.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:26:31
There are numerous wallets out there that let you pick. For some reason you chose to tie yourself to an app or exchange which doesn't let you choose. That's not bitcoins fault, that's yours. Bitcoin let's you pick the fee, wherever your money sits doesn't. In the future, take control of your BTC.

 Just made my account and I’ll be transferring the last of my coins out of Coinbase tonight. Good riddance. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:16:55
Troll somewhere else. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:50:41
How would you solve it without centralizing the network? The only logical move is to move smaller transactions to a second layer. I wish the solution to scaling a decentralized money to was to increase the block size or move to POS, but it's not.
Fees suck for small transactions right now, but that's the price you pay to settle on the safest network. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:13:16
I will probably sell 1 BTC at $100,000 to buy myself a fun car (plus capital gains). I’ll keep the rest of my scraps for long term investments and pretend they don’t exist.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:23:14
I've been here since 2013, but thanks. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:50:08
After lightning is successfully implemented and only if we still run into issues with a 2nd later solution. I don’t see why we would want to make such a core change until lightning is at least tried. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:00:35
If he is in the US, that is correct. Moving between BTC and an alt is a taxable event. Make sure you have enough USD to cover your required taxable event. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:51:56
If you are in the USA, even swapping ETH-&gt;BTC or BTC-&gt;ETH triggers capital gains tax. You cannot get around this. You will need to cash out enough to USD to cover your taxes in those transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:56:10
I'm actually a fan of LTC. Until BTC gets lightning, I think it's reasonable to hold large sums it wealth in BTC, but use LTC for smaller purchases. The two work well together right now.
I believe LTC is secure, but for large sums of wealth, it is not "BTC secure". It may not be able to weather a state sponsored attack.

You have a daily limit for transfer to your back account, but you should be able to sell them all if you wanted. Just slowly withdraw them from GDAX over the course of the next few weeks. Also, may I ask why you’d want to cash them all out?
If I was in a fortunate position like you, I’d transfer and sell one bitcoin per day on GDAX. I don’t think you want to sell everything when bitcoin could go back up to 19k or higher. Spread out your sells to get a good market average. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:16:01
Whoever gets into this first will see a large profit. I really think DAPPs are the lottery now. Haha
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:22:43
They own both sites and I assume it’s an internal transfer on their database. They aren’t actually using the Blockchain to move between their two sites. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:23:08
I think I’d prefer to see you donate a small amount to charity. No more silly stunts, this community should give back and create some positive news. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:39:00
Yes. Any and every change of possession.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:49:39
People will still mine but not be rewarded bitcoins. Mining is a key part of the platform because it commits transactions to the Blockchain. Those who mine will be collecting transaction fees as their reward. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:49:46
Glad to see you made it to Reddit and cleared up confusion. ��
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:55:46
They will definitely be high, but no one is sure how high. By that time 2100 something, we will probably have bigger blocks and well built layer two protocols like lightning. With this, we should hopefully be able to process way more transactions with smaller fees.
I’m hopeful the fees will be less for end users but higher for miners if that makes sense. It’s still really, really far away. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:05:10
You can keep the bookmark from your transaction. I did that and documented the price of both coins at the time of the transaction. It’s not great, but it’s the best I can do with the tools available. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:58:29
In theory, bitcoin would become rarer and the value would increase. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:28:34
You may need to wait for the wallet to download the whole Blockchain before your balance displays. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:05:20
There is no regulation. People who want to go in front of you pay more. It's free market. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:55:13
Everyone deciding to sell.

You can’t make bitcoin anymore. You buy it from an exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:33:37
Please don’t forget to report the fake Reddit account. They were impersonating her and taking people’s money under false pretenses. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:07:19
Congrats! I hope to keep holding until 1BTC is $50K and then cash one out to pay a substantial amount of a new Corvette GrandSport. Stupid “investment”, but I really want a fun weekend car and, to me, the GrandSport is my Lambo. After that, I’ll save whatever scraps of BTC I have left and hodl until I retire. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:54:13
If in the US, Coinbase is a good start. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:40:26
HODL. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:10:30
And then 8-9 months of bitching for people to please implement the LN. It’s no where near close sadly. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:05:54
22k Ready to go!
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:22:13
Why did you buy if you didn’t believe in Bitcoin? You bought at the top of the mountain. I think we all believe it will get there again and go higher, but this isn’t a race. Just hold tight and hope that it goes to 20k+. Bitcoin isn’t a game or a get rich quick scheme. While you wait, you should read up on the technology and understand why you bought in.
