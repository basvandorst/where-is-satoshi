This shows how retarded this sub has become.  You guys still think Ethereum is gonna disappear magically or somethin.  It's been frickin 4 years.  Bitcoin maximalism is going retardo.

What's good about the book(which of course I read.....better than any book out there IMO, just in aesthetic and verbage) is that it actually talks about the money paradigm and how it's traversed through the ages.  Out of the 100 non fiction books I'm reading this year, this one is by bar the most enjoyable.  The man deserves millionaire status for writing such a wonderful book.  For the technology/mathematically inclined "Advances in Financial Machine Learning" by Lopez de Prado/Wiley will rock your socks off, if you can understand it.

Just telling all the confirmation bias dweebs and newbs in predictions aren't always right.  He was dead wrong about altcoins in 2014 and I saw his speech while all of you were doing this exact same thing back then.

It is already copywritten. Perhaps maybe an idea of how I could attract bitcoin investors in particular of the script.  I would also like to make history as well, it is not impossible and on top of it.........most ICOs that will dissapear next year have accrued 100x more than my asking price.
@_date: 2018-06-04 21:39:55
Hmm, not a bad idea.  THANKS!

Any advice on a trailer though?  I mean shooting a short or something low budget wouldn't do the film justice.  What type of trailer did you have in mind?

Another stupid prediction, hasn't r/bittrash learned yet?

You guys say this like it's a bad thing.  Let it be a quadrillion, that'll make Bitcoin 5 million a coin.  BOOM.

Soros can just like NOT do that.  Fuck this guy.

I say earlier than that.  Tokyo 2020 Olympics it'll be over 100k for sure.
