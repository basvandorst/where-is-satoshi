His argument that temperatures are faked is also the argument from conspiracy. No significant evidence of the conspiracy is present, but the lack of evidence that his claim is correct is cited as the proof of said conspiracy.

Xitthematrix is attacking your tone because they don't have an evidence based argument. It turns the conversation from whether evidence supports climate change to whether one should ignore the arguer and allows them to compartmentalize and dismiss the argument without having to confront it on its merits. Helps resolve cognitive dissonance quickly.
In these situations, I usually just try to call it out and move on.

Don't know why this response is far down. This is the correct answer. One of the biggest problems recognized during the articles of confederation was that each state having it's own currency (and non-state backed currencies) made business really inefficient, not to mention making the government nearly impossible to fund. It also engendered division between the states which went against the intent of a perpetual union between US states. This is why they wrote the constitution to explicitly grant exclusive power to the federal government to produce currency.
While the Federal Reserve in particular was not necessarily intended (the same could be said for any particular institution founded after the constitution was written), they definitely intended for the federal government to be able to control the national currency.
