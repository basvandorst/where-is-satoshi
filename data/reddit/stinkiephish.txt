Use Armory if you do not want a third-party to know how many Bitcoins your IP address has. Electrum/Multibit necessarily expose your IP and your bitcoin addresses (and therefore those addresses' balances) in order to work in their "light" manner. (Light being without a full blockchain.)

FYI - Armory downloads (via torrent) and uses a bootstrap file for the blockchain when initially run.

This is because their hot wallet was empty. In the last 15 minutes, I have had BTC withdrawals work properly. (I was extremely nervous for a while...)

For CoPay, you do not need a third-party. You can run your own [Bitcoin Wallet Service]( and point your thin CoPay client to it. Then, there's no leakage of privacy or risk of your client auto-updating.

Regarding the relicensing, from a paranoid due diligence standpoint, were steps taken to ensure that the change from GPL to MIT is legal? Particularly, does anyone know whether Electrum requires contributors (if there are any outside of Electrum) to sign an IP assignment? I see a lot of commits by different contributors, [listed here](
The potential trouble arises if contributors provided code, that they own and continue to own, licensed under the GPL. Electrum does not automatically have the right to relicense that code with a more permissive license and anyone incorporating the supposed MIT licensed code into their own project and not complying with the strong copyleft of GPL could run into trouble.
Edit: [Yes! It looks like they did take the necessary steps.]( Great job to the Electrum team!

Armory Quorum™ allows the functionality, but it is not multiple levels of multi-sig. You can require M-of-N, and for any individual N, require X-of-Y. [See the bottom left of the second page of the brochure here (warning: 30 MB PDF)](

You need both. 
Armory relies on Bitcoin Core to perform many functions, and Bitcoin Core needs its own database. This is the Bitcoin blockchain and is how you have all of the security and privacy features of Bitcoin.
Armory has a number of features that expand upon Bitcoin Core, and requires its own database.

Armory and Electrum use two very different methods to "connect" to the network. Armory relies on Bitcoin Core for its connection and uses the Bitcoin Core's blockchain database, while Electrum connects to a central server for information regarding the blockchain. Because their connection methods are not related, Armory and Electrum connection difficulties are likely not related to either software and the issue lies somewhere else.
Are you trying to use Tor?

Based on what historical performance? Why not a drop to $500 or $300, instead of the $600-700 range? I only ask because if you look at a log scale of the prices, it seems that the price was doubling every few months or so. Then China happened, and the price went up about 5x that trend. "Based on historical performance" seems to be about $300-400 for now, off the top of my head. (I ask genuinely, not as criticism...)
