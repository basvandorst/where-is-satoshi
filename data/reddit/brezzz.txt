My reaction is extreme because these types of things are particularly exploitative of those with gambling problems and it being touted as the future of insider trading  is all I need to hear to know it's a shitty idea made by shitty people that doesn't deserve to work. Should it be allowed to exist? Maybe, but it definitely doesn't deserve to be celebrated by a community as a good thing. 
Frankly any attempt at being neutral or having polite discourse in discussing what these people are doing is giving these people too much of a leg up. Gentle reserved critique is for people with good intentions and poor ideas, not those using a century old illegal con dressed up with fancy scrolling websites and friendly informational videos on how they will change the world. 
Not talking about you, or even OP here, I mean the proprietors. They deserve to be put down every chance they get and it's pathetic that so far only 1 other person here has done so. I guess we can watch this thing together and see what happens.

You assume aggregate data is going to be useful and that makes what is effectively gambling moral, I disagree. The average person does not need to act rationally or come to an informed decision even if there is a financial incentive. Like Oculus, public opinion would be shaped by hints of release date or their understanding of product cycles and a bit of guessing, financially incentivizing it would not create unique information so nothing new can be gleaned from wisdom of the crowd. Had the bitcoin crowd placed ~~wagers~~ "market orders on a discrete outcome" (wink wink) 1 year ago for the price today, that group would have been off by orders of magnitude.
I would consider this the equivalent of sports betting, which all above the board operations use professional forecasting and fixed odds. I think there is a reason for that, in that wisdom of the crowd gets it wrong more than a single very informed group gets it right, built in advantage or no and that is the closest example that I can come up with. oh yeah, and Berkshire Hathaway on bitbet. LOLOLOLOL

This is LITERALLY a bucket shop. How the fuck did this get upvoted? Are you all such degenerate gamblers that the regular betting sites aren't doing it anymore? Just need that new killer app now the greece isn't falling for it? I'm reminded of the rich people in the *absurd* comedy movie Rat Race with this shit. It wasn't meant to be something to work towards, people. 
Your innocent example with Oculus is something that has already been done with sites like BitBet. It's also like google saying that Chrome Incognito is for buying surprise presents. Insider information, why in the ever loving fuck would that make any sense to you? If it wasn't completely contradictory I would bet all on this site closing shop in less than 6 months. Is that open to being interpreted as insider info, or is it just wisdom of the crowd? 
And isn't it silly to assume that liquidity will naturally exist in this thing? Why would I, the average person tired of inserting $5 bills into slot machines while my dice tab runs a martingale, and betting on telesynced dog races want to go up against this supposed insider trading? "What, tens of thousands of dollars are being bet against Enron? No, that's a great company that is going places, everyone needs electricity and gas, I'm going all in." &lt;--How bitcoin gambling addicts actually think.

The accounts sending 200k deposits and the bids are business accounts. The accounts shut down for bitcoin activity were mostly personal accounts, and probably at very shitty banks in general that somebody with money would be smart enough to avoid. Either way don't make a habit out of doing business from a personal account, the bank gives you certain perks and protections under the assumption you are very limited in exposure with a personal account. 
I bet if the businesses accounts didn't have a history or at the very least didn't float the amounts they sent the banks would have a very different view of the activity.

If the theory that they lost control of a cold wallet and the coins are there, but not accessible, then releasing them when they can show logical ownership is a totally different deal than giving them back if they were stolen. If the former they have a long shot at getting them back independently. If the latter, it's not ever going to happen anyway. 
It damages the reputation of bitcoin, so does this whole fiasco. No one person has control over that choice, thankfully, so at the very least it will require a simple popular vote of the miners / nodes to do something like that. I don't see it happening.

I've handled thousands of series 1996 hundreds at my job, and it never takes more than one minute to tell their authenticity with 100% certainty. Yes, I've rejected "good" fakes several times too, and the bank inspects them very thoroughly on deposit, so I can safely say this with good confidence. My only complaint with the 1996 $100 is the UV in the security strip. It needed to be brighter. 
As for other countries, I like what they do especially with the new polymer windows and holographics. 
As far as I know none have tried color shifting ink on their bills like the US has.

B. The NSA can keep hush about a bug while exploiting it themselves. Fortunately the NSA has nothing to do with bitcoin, right?
C. Small team of devs for something so important is silly. You have all the problems with centralization without the benefit of having a big team in there to support it when things go wrong.

It probably wouldn't have mattered in this case, the initial smaller withdraw would have certainly been covered even by a complete scam, it was the big one that was the problem.

SatoshiDice was accused of basically doing this. Whether intentional or not, the fact is it could have been handled a whole lot more efficiently and it bloated up the blockchain early on. 
The easy solution is to raise transaction fees. You kill what little utility there was in micro-transactions which wasn't much, but it makes the exploit process more expensive and easier to deplete their funds. This [somewhat] solves the denial of service this causes others in getting transactions confirmed. 
Another proposed solution is to prune the blockchain if it becomes unwieldy. It's a bit different than what goes on ordinarily, I don't think it has ever been done before either. The there is no functional need to store hashes and transactions for empty addresses. They do this in the interest of complete  impartiality as there could be a **huge** conflict of interest and risk in doing this, but if it gets bad enough, that's going to be a path we must consider going down.

Because news doesn't matter much in this current environment, it's waiting on China right now. 
Plus, merchants that have competition and offer other payment methods don't get people into any currency, and that is in the most basic form how you increase the value of the currency. Imagine you get off a plane in another country and want to buy some food. The restaurant takes your native currency, or local. Why would you exchange for that transaction? Merchants that take bitcoin give consumers options to get **out**, and only out, because they cash out their haul every day. This imbalance lowers the price. Bitpay has to do this unless it has some really fuckin' deep pockets, there is no altruistic motive here where they send it to the moon for everybody by stockpiling it. 
If you want the price to go up, give people a way **in** that is near frictionless and cheap. I write this not knowing how to do it. Once this happens, if at all, merchants supporting bitcoin will certainly be good news that raises the price, because *then* you get people coming in just for that purpose. Until that happens, who cares about some enthusiasts cutting into their stockpile?

Oh look, someone else that thinks bitcoin invented PKC (amongst other more glaring issues).
There is no need for the innovation of the blockchain in this instance because it is in the best interest of a participating user to retain the information and it proves its own cryptographic accuracy. You still run into the issues of key distribution and refutable repositories. Yes, even namecoin has this issue. You can't prove it was me all along without a vigorous signup process and biometrics.

It's beyond highly unlikely to happen once at all in any reasonable time frame and circumstance. 
If it were to happen, the flaw would not be in the size of the address-space, but the method of generating random numbers. 
I believe using some such shenanigans, it was done. Once, intentionally, and made some news around here, but I can't find it.
Anyway, no need to worry about it unless there's some really big breakthroughs in computing, or a popular method of generating random numbers is found to be unsound. That would have wide reaching effects in every form of cryptography, so it is likely to be detected and hopefully corrected fast, and the fact it hasn't been detected yet is somewhat promising.

Not that I inherently believe this post, but the list of emails in the pastebin just doesn't look real. I'm posting my thoughts here because dissent would not be greeted well there, and if real it would be in bad taste.
The addresses / names are too squeaky clean, too many email addresses are combinations of the names listed. If there are numbers, they are years. That's not realistic IMO. There are a few believable ones peppered in, but not really a substantial amount and not what I would expect. Anyway, I think this list is the result of procedurally generated names / email addresses. 
Full disclosure: That doesn't mean they did not use the exploit along with procedurally generated address to get real name / address combinations and reject incorrect ones. Such a thing might prove successful and might generate a real list exactly like this one. 
There are people chiming in on that reddit post confirming their names are present or they have gotten emails recently. That's weird, so this list could indeed be genuine like I said above. You could also have a look at the calendar.
I'm interested to hear coinbase's response. Coinbase did not address the story claiming the exploit. There was confirmable social media communications involved. Email requests are a unique feature to coinbase so there is a chance they consider this to be a feature and the response will be that the email addresses were already known. It may not be a fulfilling response.

Okay, so bitcoin address A with 100 bitcoin  contains in its entirety clearly, provably, stolen bitcoin and every person on earth including the thief agrees it is and puts it in this ledger. 
He spends it with innocent third parties that don't care about this ledger that are conducting legal business. 
Address B was empty and had no bitcoin. Should we add B to the ledger?
Pop quiz hotshot: 
Address C is different, it had 100 clean bitcoin in it already and A sent 10. C now wants to spend 20 bitcoin with someone that checks the stolen ledger. Yay or nay on that transaction? How about spending 81 more bitcoin?

That level of entropy is acceptable for a password but not a brain wallet. The difference is I can brute force a brainwallet on my hardware by my rules. I would not need to check the phrase against a user account or salted hashes or whatnot, it's a matter of getting the private key from that type of phrase, checking to see if it makes addresses that contain funds, if not, I move on. You lose your advantage there with that. 
Those types of words are common, they would probably make a short dictionary file. You have a potential keyspace of (dictionary size)^4. For 2000 line dictionaries that's 16 trillion permutations of 4 words. Seems like a lot, but you are at the mercy of what kind of hashes your brainwallet decided to use. A proper random address is 2^256 in keyspace, aka number with 78 decimals... your space doesn't hold a candle to it. 
The hashes make it or break it. To allow something like that phrase to be "secure" you need to ensure generating an address from it will take a very long time. If my computer can chug through 10 thousand of them in a second, I can break it in your lifetime, on one machine... and my reward is not just your coins, it's anybody else who used such a system too. 
So it's no bueno. Now if the function to make the private key from such a password was intensive and took a long time, like a few seconds, and was somehow mathematically proven to be difficult enough to be that way for a while, it would be okay. You would still get your best security with a real random key though. That uses numbers so big that computation as we know it could not possibly bruteforce keys in a meaningful way.

My philosophy is if they are looking that hard at you, it's because they already suspect you of having it and the finding it is just a formality that WILL happen eventually.

Side-chains are not particularly interesting, they are just a ploy to keep hashing power in bitcoin and arguably keep the money in. If I'm making an innovative offshoot I might as well do it completely separately and take the small risk of uncontrolled hashing power early on for the large reward of getting in early and having it independent from bitcoin entirely.
Since you seem to know the huge importance of them, how about you tell me in your own words why they are so significant that a general tech subreddit should be talking about them. Really, all ears here. At best I see it as a curiosity for @_date: 2014-04-19 16:47:17

Agreed. As a business I would have serious doubts about using email as the primary authentication method for account resets. Just imagine the headache that would cause. 
If I was a business just glancing at bitcoin:
A. I don't give a shit about the merits of white paper. I want the red and black ink paper. Gox just made a lot of red ink.
B. I'm not looking for the opinion of its most adamant users. Sorry, they're too far in to be reliable. I'm looking at the news organizations and friends I trust already. 
C. Maybe I've miss the opportunity bitcoin has to offer. I look at overstock and tiger direct. Has it really benefited them in any major way? Sure a little extra income is great, sure if I really looked into accepting it I can see it converted to USD immediately, but am I really going into all that research after seeing a major company invovled in bitcoin shit the bed? Probably not as likely. Sorry
Right now I don't see a customer base that would consistently chose me because I offer bitcoin. I see it as a fad. I see fad customers coming in for a month and then disappearing entirely. Maybe a damn persistent fad as a whole, but my adequate customer base at this time is not demanding it, some group on the internet is. I'm not putting forth the effort.

What a cop-out. It's the number one exchange for USD. Perhaps it does say a *bit* about the state of the bitcoin economy at this time. 
This post  is hilariously juxtaposed with the [circle-jerking]( that fiat banks are wrong because they ask what you are doing with your money and have daily withdraw limits (in the thousands of dollars). That's not a problem with fiat money itself, by your logic, you can just use a safe or another bank. Of course if I chimed in with that, it's simply a ridiculous statement and I might have to downvote myself for making it. 
Meanwhile it's the fucking wild west out here in gox land, and some people can't get their money **at all**, and it's not some backwater operation doing it. I say again that it is the number one exchange for USD and the defacto price even today.  It's not ignoreable, it's a fucking problem. It's a problem regulation solved decades ago for legitimate fiat business, across the board, unless you know of any bank runs lately. 
When people boast the positives of bitcoin, they like to talk all day about the economies and businesses built around it. Start criticizing those same economies and businesses, and all of a sudden they are not important and bitcoin is only a protocol, everything else is completely unrelated and completely severable.  You can't have it both ways.

I would recommend reading it all as I'm probably going to miss parts as I'm not keen to the gambling scene. Also, longest TLDR in reddit history:
Casinos often give you deposit bonuses as a promotion but there are a lot of strings attached about how much you have to gamble and conditions to actually withdraw money, bonus or not. They want you to have a fair chance at losing it all, and this is pretty clear.
The big problem with this story was there were conflicting information from them about what types of bets counted towards their rules, and the amount that had to carry over be replenished, etc. So in a string of emails he got conflicting reports about what type and amount of bets would actually allow him to withdraw his money. He kept betting insane amounts to further towards that goal, and they kept moving it, going against what was said in email, likely because they could not pay out. 
If you read it he claims he did not do too poorly on bets, he's a professional gambler, so it seems this shadiness really fucked him over. They obviously closed and he's not getting shit.

But I thought they would all overbid because they could not buy that much on the books without affecting the price. So now they are going to do it anyway. Okay. 
I guess it makes more sense than  the logic that a few people overpaying will somehow inspire everyone else to as well. Someone is going to have to run that by me in simple english.
And of course nobody here considers the other side of the auction amount. It's not necessarily comparable to a huge *buy* order which would skyrocket the market if put on, it's a sell order just as much as it is anything, and that happens to do the opposite. Don't think a majority of bidders aren't taking that into consideration, but of course the question to ask if at least one **IS** willing to pay. if you have no knowledge of this it's just conjecture. Fun conjecture.

Because bitcoin is supposed to be a mathematically secured system where transactions are inherently authentic and reputable. Not a place where it's airtight except for that one thing that relies on a single player remaining good to keep it secure. I don't give a shit if it's in that players best interests to play fair or not, that level of control what was not intended and it's perhaps the biggest oversight bitcoin has. 
I'm not holding it above *anybody* to want to see it crash for their own perceived gain. You need not look further than right here to see the opinion thrown around seriously. 
A mining operation is not a democracy, it's centrally controlled. Your only vote is to leave or stay, and greed or inability to act fast will cause delay while the damage of a bad player would happen. Bitcoin is fucked if somebody sets out with the intention of doing this solo to destroy the protocol. 
Now as for their stake... what stake? Bitcoin mining is proof of work, not stake. They could hold very little coin at all. Sitting on a ton of mining gear? Who cares once its paid off? It's worthless after the difficulty rises much more. Go 100% fiat, crash it, buy in and hope it goes up long term. That's how you get some more time out of your investment. Lord knows this place thinks it's going up crazy long term, and **nothing** can stop it, the miners probably do as well. It doesn't have to make sense to everybody, it doesn't even have to hold up to scrutiny. If somebody *thinks* this, they might *do* it, and that is why 51% is bad news.

Your time would be better spent targeting unsound implementations that create private keys than the keyspace itself. It's too big. 
Brain wallets, vanity addresses and the like represent potentially much smaller keyspaces and may prove more fruitful. 
A brain wallet for example, is much easier to start attacking than a key generated by RNG. You could make assumptions like checking for only the top 100 most common words, checking passages from media, etc. Still an enormous undertaking, but your odds of collision (with live funds) are not astronomically low.

Why would I not sell at 20 if I think it will be 10 later? I can double my holding, and get a 2x share of moon profits this place thinks are inevitable.  It doesn't have to be a tested way of thinking, it doesn't even have to hold up to much scrutiny, it just has to be believed by enough people with their hands on the button to make an impact. 
Would I ever risk such a play? Fuck no, not at 20. But if I bought in at $200 and the price is 200, I see it as worth it. There's a ton of people in at prices before 200.

It's easier to say that address is for that one particular transaction, if it has funds then they belong to that particular customer and pertain to that transaction.
Proving who paid what could be difficult in a busy address, probably not a deal breaker for small business, just looking at the last transaction is probably good enough but doesn't scale well.
You would want to to individual transactions to maintain more privacy too. Yeah you can follow everything to crazy levels on blockchain.info, but having a single address gives you business sales totals and a list of all sending addresses right there, no investigation needed, a lot could be inferred from that, and a business doesn't want it out there to clearly.

Actually, it's a fool's bet for him. He'd be putting about 4 or 5 bucks in escrow **today**, which would get him .01 bitcoin which would satisfy the wager at the price point he predicts. You put no money in (from what I can read, maybe a trivial amount for escrow contract purposes) and because of this, it's your choice to perform the crow eating, as the only thing on the line is your pseudo-anonymous reputation in this place, which is worth nill for everyone here. 
If bitcoin somehow makes 100k, all he gets to do is have his ego stroked. Frankly, every person involved in bitcoin is going to be doing that, so the skeptic is no worse off, and you have a shot at making 1k if you want to do something disgusting. If you don't take the offer up and produce a video, he gets his original amount of bitcoins back from the mother of all HODLs, but he is no better off than if he just had them to begin with.

A 1500 watt oil-filled heater will run you 50 bucks. With mining hardware you are starting out in a hole in the ground a lot bigger than 50 dollars. 
There is no innovation that will make it anything more than marginal (all costs considered) for those *on the cutting edge* of mining because that innovation is the mechanism that causes it to be that way in the first place. I would not think that even someone operating under the guise of free electricity is actually able to cover the cost of equipment in any reasonable timeframe.
Try it, check some boat anchors used on ebay for a few hundred, note you won't make that back over the lifetime, it's making dust not worthy of your time after a few difficulty increases. The top of the line has a better payout, but I anecdotally don't see you making back the hefty costs and this assumes everything works perfectly over the lifetime, one foul up and your whole venture is shot and you have a doorstop.

It's not so much about the tech knowledge as it is as it is wanting to enter the ecosystem. I can pay a company to handle bitcoin for me, no biggie. I can find that service exists after very little research. The question a business must ask is why should they bother. What does it promise? A marginal increase in sales for a limited amount of time? An ever so slight advantage on credit card fees that require the effort of doing business with another company? Nice companies, don't get me wrong, but if 1% of my sales are bitcoin, and it offers a 2% edge over CC, the time on the computer to set that up is worth more than my savings over any reasonable amount of time.
It's just an innovation that doesn't have much incentive at the moment for your average retailer, and bad news is not helping that at all for the short to medium term. It's a nice protocol waiting for somebody to take advantage of it. There's money to be made in *that* aspect of it. For an existing business, it's just a little side project. 
I just see it as the equivalent of not accepting credit cards in the 60s. Big whoop if you tell your one customer a month that has one that you can't take them, the guy pulls out his wallet and gives you cash money anyway. If bitcoin gets to the point of credit cards in say the 80s, businesses will take notice and accept them, no way around it and they won't be for the worse for waiting. That's a pretty big "if" right there.

Lack of minimum wage creates a race to the bottom by the underclass. It is perhaps the most important "safety net" that the push for systematic / state run welfare has spawned, and most people don't even see it as such. It's direct to the people who need it, and about as efficient as you can get because of that. Since it truly is just a survivable salary, and most strive to have that for their citizens, someone (aka the middle class) are going to pay for that sustenance either way. Either through higher taxes, or higher prices. It might as well come in the form of a paycheck from a honest week's work  than foodstamps and public housing. One stimulates the economy and the other doesn't. Since it's uniform, it does not burden one particular organisation more than the other. That's the brilliance of it.

In contrast to a generic "spokesperson", I think it takes the obvious troll / pumper out of the equation for the person who posted the email. 
I think more than likely, the email posting OP is being overly eager and taking things out of context. Just because one team at google says they are looking into it does not mean they have plans to implement it. I'm sure they look into a lot of stuff that never sees the light of day.

It's gonna be a slaughterfest, I guarantee it. 
But in all honesty, they might try to get them. They're collectible and cool right now and it would make them look good. it's not a hard sell online. So what is your reaction to extreme lowballing and saying they are not valuable or there is no market for buyers? If you have a good plan, go for it. I can't come up with one that makes sense but maybe you can. 
It's not like you can't easily crack them open and sell the face value (they might very well offer less). Now  they are collectible and worth a premium, do they know this. You could also go from the angle that you made money  at the price you bought at, but the pawn shop is still going to make a profit too. Pawnshops do flip gold and silver like this a lot, making money up and down because of the surcharge. They might play the angle that bitcoin is a logical extension of this and a modern pawnshop would want to explore their options, and obviously a television show requires something more physical like a coin to pass around and talk over. Maybe Les will even look at it with a loupe. ;) it creates a great reality TV dialog too. One person doesn't get it, the other kind of does so they explain it and try to convince them.

Lower fees? Lower than what? My debit card is free to swipe, free ATMs on the network and I am given reimbursement for 10 off-network ATM fees a month. All I have to do is keep 5 dollars in it. And a debit card to me means the same processors so the same merchant fees for them, I don't see how it gets better for the consumer unless somebody wants to jump in and do some serious undercutting to the point of hemorrhaging money, but obviously that is not a viable strategy for long. 
The general populace won't even know they are using it because there is nothing special about using it, so what is the incentive for them to go out of their way to do so? Because currently it seems debit is a slightly worse value compared to credit cards which gives me a small amount of cashback. How would cashback work with bitcoin as the middle man at all? The company handling it would be paying the fees to the CC processors. And loadable prepaid, or whatever setup you would use with bitcoin is clumsy at best compared to those two one extra step, no gain, I see no benefit.

You do have my agreement that it's scaled further than was probably anticipated and some choices made are not working out ideally, there was no omnipotence involved in the parameters despite what some people want  to believe. 
However them being set in stone  is so intrinsic to the value that it is probably not even an option worth considering if you are a fan of three digit prices and, you know, being accepted by a few places.

Well that was a good time to buy if you wanted to play the market and flip gold for a profit. Now they want to sell almost exclusively, and the people buying are places that always buy because they make money on the spread. It's coming down exactly like bitcoin, even has the same boogieman: china. Go figure. 
Anyway, the smart money in emerging markets that some thought was going to eat up metals seems to be fine going  into property, investments, and even their local currency and that is why it lost a lot of value.

Discrete hardware on phones for security is a good idea, and we are moving towards it already. Apple Pay is doing this with payment information, that's probably the closest example of it being used right now even though it's not popular around here. Sim cards do this with carrier information too, and I think if we are going to move to a standard that does this, it should be something like a sim card so that people install it themselves and it's cross platform. 
Encryption on apps and storage  of phones like mycelium uses is a no-brainer for  a user, but it's a bandaid compared to the superior solution you are talking about. Good enough for now, anyway, but it will hopefully be seen as rudimentary in the years to come.

The only motivation for doing this is so mining is profitable for the common person with modest hardware for a long time, which does solve the problem of centralization. The problem it introduces is that the average user would be able to make it instead of buy it, and it would never really have an increase in value to it because of this.
Bitcoin needs a lot of money pumped in on a regular basis to maintain value. Years ago, it was worth a lot less, predominantly because of lack of hype, but also because it could be mined by an average person.  Mining as a task is not particularly useful. It gives incentive to perform *some* tasks with the blockchain, but nodes are the workhorse and go unrewarded. 
So I really don't see why there is so much fuss about mining in general. Its task is predominantly busy work, and it's real output is near constant regardless of processing power, simply because of changes in difficulty.  People that create another coin with mining being a focus probably have motivation elsewhere, IE they want to mine like crazy in hopes it becomes worth BTC in the future. IMO anyway.

And how can you enforce rule 4 with an iron fist with that silly justification (that you surely know is wrong), when rule 3 is broken every day by front page shitposts and nothing is done?
It's not off topic to discuss XT and it's definitely not an alt, it's actually the biggest news about the scalability of bitcoin ever, I understand wanting to stay neutral because there is sincere debate and you are taking opposite position for completely understandable reasons, but modding to make it seem as though it does not exist at all is not the right thing to do. You are in all likelihood going to come out on the wrong side of history on this issue, at the very least it is an important issue that people should stay abreast on because it is directly relevant to bitcoiners, they may be on this protocol update in the future, and its failure may set a precedent for *any* kind of block size increase proposal.

$400 is not a negligible break even price. In fact just going by mining you will likely not make back most of that. Otherwise it's a bit like saying a conventional $400 workstation will make you a millionaire because you are totally going to start a business with one. Maybe this has novel uses, but you are acting like it's a sure deal that this thing is a printer of money and that is laughable, if only less people were going to get hooked by that falsehood though. 
This is like, what, business model idea 3 for them? It's obvious that mining as a significant part of another device won't work to make you money so now they are going to sell you a device that mines a very little bit, but you really make money doing ecommerce with it? Huh? I never saw ecommerce as being unapproachable these days, and their intent is to somehow make it more approachable by having people buy a $400 micro computer? Uhhh, somebody fill me in on this. All the revolutions in making commerce accessible have come from making a platform that works on many devices that people already have. Could you imagine Uber coming out and selling you a specialized $400 taximeter? Bitcoin is simple enough to work on every computer and smartphone.

If their intent is to ban end to end asymmetric encryption like we see in most privacy oriented apps then they can do it and it shouldn't *really* affect things like signatures which bitcoin and certificates use. There would be no practical need, without encryption and with cooperation of ISPs they would already have the keys to the castle so to speak.
BUT, that's already such a bad idea that I'm sure in the unlikely case it happens it will be implemented even worse and probably ambiguously ban it and 5 other things without thought. Like a speeding law that technically makes it illegal to drive a car anywhere for any reason because they didnt think about what they did and just wanted to stop speeding or give more tickets or something. 
Not even to mention explicitly banning bitcoin by name, that's never off the table either if we are talking about banning absolutely essential security practices why not just come out and get bitcoin too? They'd break email, commerce, banking... bitcoin is so inconsequential compared to that.

All they are hoping for is that by sitting on it, they make money (in another currency). That's what mining is, that's what trading is, that's what everything about it is. For a lot of people it was about getting more money than you put in to it, check out half the posts here prior to the crash, it's all about making money. Pretty soon you are going to run out of the surplus of people who are willing to input real world currency compared to those who take out, for whatever reason, and it will be so much less popular, but hopefully regain stability and find some legitimate use. That would inspire confidence. Right now the prospect of doubling your money isn't very appealing when you consider the floor can fall out at any time because of how wild the trading is. A sane person isn't going to consider it, no matter how informed about it they are.

Because no part of bitcoin involves obscuring messages, only authenticating them. A signature is cryptography, but not encryption. If it was then md5 would also be encryption by that logic.

Salt and hash doesn't mean much. The best practices with them even a few years ago are now a joke. It might buy your average password a few days for the user to reset them on other services. An exceptional password is probably safe, but those that use them already keep them different anyway.

People don't generally go around making conditional statements for no purpose at all. It's an unwritten rule of language that  conditional statements can be interpreted as prompts for the reader to give more than hypothetical consideration to the IF part of the statement being true. Depending on the context it can be damn near rhetorical.
You'd really have a hard time arguing that that the purpose of this communication was anything other than begging the question to rile up bicoin users into seriously believing that world domination is trivially easy.

I think this is the equivalent of those hokey fake historic coins they sell on TV, which piss me off too. I got a great gold plated coin with copy stamped on it for Christmas one year, and loathe the idea that grandma spent $20 on it instead of getting a Silver Eagle or something. The price should tell you this is wrong, but again, I have to agree that it's just not a good thing to name it  it with a denomination like that.

If it's relatively frictionless for the consumer, it's not a big deal. The competition in this scenario is paypal that takes about 3%. It's conceivable that this percentage can be beaten with bitcoin consistently, even after fees associated with cashing in and out for consumer and merchant. If the small savings are passed on to the consumer, they pay for the conversion and then some. This would be why it is adopted by many people. Bitcoin has a lower overhead, no such thing as charge-backs, and all of that adds up. Right now companies like bitpay are taking 1% and doing both things for the merchant. I'm sure a savvy person can buy BTC at just above value too, and if it's mainstream that will become easier.
That being said I don't think it is fair to  assume that current fees and risk aversion that bitpay does will carry into the future. Bitpay is so cheap because it is a calculated risk based on the currency being deflationary, their policy will probably change if that isn't the case anymore. that's the case for a lot of companies involved in bitcoin. If the total fees for a transaction from USD to USD go up to paypal levels, which they may very well have to, then all utility in this scenario is gone. It's something to watch out for, anyway.

Definitions of "alive" may vary considerably after a government intervention.
FFS this place was just talking  about it being a moon currency with 100% certainty a weeks ago, now the sentiment, not just yours either, is that it will always live if it can be used by a savvy user that gets around several government blocks, trading on the street and in black markets. So forgive me for commenting on some things that are not in your post in particular. 
Ignoring the fact that this represents a significantly lower market share, which represents death in the eyes of the loads of die-hards, particularly the ones who bought in at triple digits, even that line of thinking is fucking absurd. I don't even see this small subset of the population of a country that has banned it bothering with it on an scale that matters. Make it harder to use than cash / pay pal / credit card, and it's promise of supplementing them dies, so does the value, and it's dead in the water for 99.99999% of people. It's value is entirely speculative at this stage, and that's not going to change in the time frame of these hypothetical bans.  And that one guy that might have used it for that one thing sees the value tank and decides to use conventional means to do it. The government bans it, yeah, you can still do transactions on the block chain. Whoopie, after the time of a major ban the guy that spent several thousand on a pizza would seem thrifty, and obviously the transaction would have to be carried out like it was, cash, as no retailer touches it with a 10 foot pole.

And people in the early 00s said the US government couldn't stop online gambling either. But it effectively happened, sites shut their doors to the US, some just shut down entirely.  Today a few states set up their own version of online gambling to be regulated by them. It is nowhere near practical for a person to gamble without using one of those state run sites. I can see the argument that you can gamble today, freely, by sending some BTC to a 1dice address. Yes, but as a policy that site does not want to interact with you, and you only got that money in the frist place because a coin purchasing site and bank went along with it, that would not be the case if they did not wish it to be.

I would be fine letting OP continue to use his soapbox in a hole of ignorance, but since others want to know:
These numbers tend to fuzz at 66% upvotes and 33% downvotes, and anything able to stay above that ratio for a long time is actually relatively well received by the community. Naturally every post like this will eventually fall to 66% upvotes and then be removed from the front page, that's how we get fresh content. The simple truth is that if 160 accounts  downvoted a post on this subreddit, and their vote counted, it would never see the front page he pulled these numbers from.

Don't bother buying such a small amount, let reddit give it to you.
 
Click redeem karma in the sidebar, you will get around a dollars worth that way. A cents worth of bitcoin is going to be eaten up in transfer fees if you want to play around with it, so I recommend this way to give you a better idea of the mechanics. I really appreciate them doing it, as I could see that it is actually a very fluid way to transfer money, you can do it with a reddit bot and be your own banker if you wanted to be.

Launder / spend? No. The point of laundering money is to give you a legitimate "source" of the money so that it could be spent without suspicion. Ignoring the fact that he would have to get the funds in somehow, lets just say Gus paid him in it, it might be a plausible lie that he got in very early or something, but any scrutiny would reveal that to not be the case.

The way I see it, if it gives major competition to paypal, it's done damn fine. There's folks around here who think it needs to replace your bank, credit card, hole in the mattress, federal reserve, and all of that, and they are more than a bit delusional at this point. 
What it **is** ready to do is act as a fast and reliable method to pay for goods online with comparable and even slightly easier methods to implement than alternatives. Right now i think speculation is hurting that aspect, as price fluctuations and deflation do hurt the economy. But again, some people don't think it "wins" until they can retire at 18 because they got in years ago, and will act like deflation is good all day long.

The problem with buying custom hardware to mine, which is the only way to mine effectively, is that you have to find a company selling it. 
Why would a company sell a machine for less than they could potentially make with it by simply plugging it in and waiting a few months? 
Your ROI is dependent upon speed of the machine and time. Your machine has to be as fast as it can be, which is expensive now, but potentially cheaper later. Time being important because of the built in difficulty level of mining increases with time, and it's a jump and not a gradual change. Your machine (once you get it from this company, lol) if profitable in the beginning at all, will hit a time where the electricity costs more than the payout for any reasonable value of bitcoin. It's important to note that this difference in cost of electricity and hardware versus value of bitcoin is marginal at any scale, there's not a whole lot of money to be made doing it.
If you think the value of bitcoin is going to the moon, it's a wise choice to produce them and sit on them, and mining would be profitable, but you can buy them for only slightly more than it costs to make, so it is profitable either way.

They will ship it to a gun store near you where they run the required background check for a fee and then release it to you. It can't be anonymous as the name and address of the buyer have to match on the invoice or they will not know it is yours. Its probably best to call the local store up and see if they will do it and send them the info of the online store before you drop some serious coin on it.

Really, the market cap of bitcoin being quoted as current price * number of coins in existence is an absurd idea right now, considering a majority of coins were never bought or sold at a number near the current value in USD. People love to quote that number when times are high, but is anybody right now seriously thinking a billion dollars worth of market value vanished from bitcoin this morning? Probably not, but the second it goes up, it's another story. 
Some people are doing a much more reasonable estimate saying it will be worth this much as a whole currency if it takes XX% of business from paypal. While that is ambitious, I think it is a much more astute estimate and does not need the total number of bitcoins to compute, unless you wanted to get an idea of exchange prices for one unit when that happens.

Any arguments about the price being far too high go back to the infrastructure being strong. It reminds me of John McCain's "the fundamentals of the economy are strong" speech. Nobody is criticizing the infrastructure or the fundamentals, the fact is bitcoin will always have a provably strong and simple system in place to transfer digital wealth. That goes for $10k per bitcoin, that goes equally well for 10k bitcoins per pizza. It tells me nothing about this currency coming into it, nor the intentions of the masses that ultimately control its value.
