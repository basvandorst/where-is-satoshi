You're not clear about why the transfer back didn't work.  Is it unconfirmed because of zero fee?
If so, try and get a copy of the raw transaction.  You can retransmit yourself until the coins are aged enough to spend (approx 5 days).
Basically, from what you've stated, I don't see a reason to believe the coins need to be lost.

If free money is hurt please hurt me harder! 
I don't think it's Matthew that will be regretting this bet, nor does the GLBSE market.

Right. If some miner is building blocks that other miners believe is detrimental, nothing is forcing them to relay or build on it.  Let free market concensus decide.

You seem to want to dictate conditions.  That never works.  Simply make no rules and let the free market decide the appropriate fee.  Too low and miners will ignore your transaction.  Too high and you're just paying more than you should.   
Everyone is happy in a free market.

Yes you must encrypt even deterministic wallets.   Anyone who grabbed a copy of your wallet can see your entire transaction history, and future transactions too.  They cannot spend your coins, but your privacy with that wallet is gone forever.

Uhh they're providing a service that benefits them and the user.   What's to complain about? If you don't like it go elsewhere, no one's forcing you to use it.

Coming from a core developer this sentiment is concerning. 
You fail to address a simple point : fees are an agreement between miner and person making a transaction.   Where do you figure in that equation? 
You don't. Let the market decide.  I'm glad that at least Gavin seems to appreciate this basic concept.

It's envy that you had the balls to do something they didn't, and worse, were successful doing it.  Explains it all.

You're right.  Neat huh?  Also, if you're very paranoid, a good reason to spend all funds from an address in one go as that reveals the public key, removing a layer of protection of any funds remaining or deposited in future at that address.

Your failure to argue against my point says it all.

What's deceptive about it? The prices are real.  I fail to see what you are objecting to.

What if a shady employee opens your box and happens to know what a paper wallet is? Unlikely now, as few know about bitcoin, but more likely as time passes.

There is no tragedy of the commons. No one is forcing miners to participate.  Remove the block size limit entirely and let miners be free to pursue any policy they choose. 
No one miner will have a monopoly, and no miner is obliged to include any given transaction, the way it should be.
