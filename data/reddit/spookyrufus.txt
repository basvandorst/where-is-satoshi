this 'crowdsourcing website' very much looks like a template you took somewhere and changed some text in.
That button that increments the counter would appear to be the main 'feature' while I'm afraid it's completely useless, to the point that you cannot really trust that number.
I don't want to sound mean, but everything on that page screams 'empty template' to me.

this stuff is senseless and should not be upvoted.

While I see how statistically your action won't affect the election, wouldn't it be more responsible to, you know, vote properly, and then focus your energies on spreading information about Bitcoin in some other way?

How about Simon Hausdorf from Bitcoin24 ?

how is it just one of these two options? why 5 digits? can you support these statements in any way? - I'm genuinely asking
@_date: 2013-04-01 07:46:06
well I would say nowadays its attainable to somehow a subset of the global population, and this subset is destined to keep growing in size (according to my perception of bitcoin media exposure etc.), and potentially become much more useful (as in being adopted as official payment option).
But this easy way of thinking won't help me take any conclusion on the quality of my potential investment (in terms of actual risks/profits)
@_date: 2013-04-01 08:56:44
i guess it all comes down to either politely answering something to someone who is genuinely asking a question or just dropping some buzzwords and thus risking to sound like a douchebag.

Well I am in a quite ok financial situation right now (no debt, saving a good amount each month after all expenses), so I was thinking of starting with 1k EUR and see what happens to them. Losing completely that sum will not ruin me (well, piss me off at the very least!), but I was trying to be realistic on the expectations. Thanks for the reply!

havalli is saying that Simon may as well write in German and someone translate into English for him. Which may not be a bad idea.
@_date: 2013-04-01 07:02:28
I get this was a joke. Didn't get the joke though :-)

Dude find some serious lawyer and make this happen. I'm sure some people here would even be able to provide free legal assistance to get the situation resolved within the 7 days.
Keep us posted.
@_date: 2013-04-02 07:35:42
Is this statement backed up by any theory? :-) 
@_date: 2013-04-14 12:02:25
Simon, we all are literally just waiting for you to let us know more. Please keep the updates coming.
We understand the pressure you are facing but please, cowboy the hell up and try your best to resolve this situation.
We are willing to help in any possible way, but seriously, please understand that many of us invested enough trust and money in Bitcoin-24 for all this to keep us awake at night as much as you.

I feel this should have more upvotes. This is a big deal for many Europeans. And the credibility of Bitcoin is strictly related to how this type of problems are handled.

I had a withdraw order that was shown as 'processing' for already two days now. Nothing else there (EUR or BTC). Did I just lose my money?
@_date: 2013-04-16 22:58:47
Are there any updates that I missed or today  nothing happened at all? 
@_date: 2013-04-01 07:05:41
Thank you for the insight. I'm honestly having even trouble understanding whether people are being greedy or fearful about the bitcoin thing.
Some people are talking about it being a bubble which soon will burst (which I understand what it means in practical terms but I dont understand how this is backed up in real life), some others are seemingly investing a lot in it.
How does one understand what is the reality?
And sorry if after this question I sound even stupider, it's just that as a junior scientist, I don't know much about practical financial matters.
@_date: 2013-04-15 20:39:06
he said he'd report YOU. how would that help you?
Also, do you wanna sue the german government?!??!?!
This whole thing starts to look SO bad. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 07:06:43
But isn't this demand supposed to keep growing and growing for a long time? At least this would be my guess, based on a quite superficial knowledge of the bitcoin phenomenon, not much in technical terms but in terms of media exposure / etc.

This attitude of yours has just began to be unacceptable.
Reddit is not place for announcements concerning such matters. 
** You HAVE TO make official statements and provide us with detailed, daily updates on the situation. **
Do you even realize that hundreds of people out here are ready to press charges against you? Do you realize of the implications?
If this hasn't happened yet (and I bet many already are taking legal action) it is just because an extremely patient community wishes to solve the matter in a peaceful way. This of course can't last forever, if you don't start taking strong positions and making clear statements on the subject.
EDIT: Also, which law firm represents you? The one associated with your business seems not to know anything about all this, and their lawyer for Polish affairs is on holiday and will be back tomorrow: 
EXPLANATIONS. NEEDED. NOW.

I tried sending them an E-mail to the recently published E-mail address. But well I'm guessing that as I did, so did thousands of other people.
At least they posted something. I hope they truly are legitimate and they will actively work in the upcoming days. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 12:58:58
Thanks for your comment. I fully understand and support the importance of such project, and in large measure admire the reliability and complexity.
It is undeniable though how it could also be a good investment for someone in my position, thus I thought to ask here for some advice.
@_date: 2013-04-16 23:00:19
any update?
