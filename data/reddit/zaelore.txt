Would you accept payment in bitcoins?
(jk lol good luck selling)

This is what I see. I think OP's browser is acting up.

You could use them to heat your home.

I think it just doesn't know which way to go.

Bitcoins &amp; Politics. Is this a box of worms we really want to open? :)
On the other hand it's basically inevitable anyways.

Are you sure there's no way to encrypt the content? Couldn't you issue each worker a key or something?

I think this is a great idea! My question is, do you require the agents to provide receipts to prove they are not inflating the price and their commission?

This is a brilliant idea. I hope it happens &amp; works.

Getting this wrong almost makes it look like it's trying to screw over the silk road by saying it's not safe.

It does seem like something's going on, the price has been pretty stable at around $20 for the 3rd day in a row after major swings, it feels quiet, too quiet.
Edit: Everyone's probably too busy watching greece default.

I'm using CA virtex right now, it seems pretty sufficient and transferring funds from a standard rbc checking account was pretty easy using interac.

Here's an idea: build a distributed cpu power clearing house. Even though pools allow people to get *some* btc back at any level of hardware, people are going to get bored mining extremely little when as the difficulty peaks. I haven't done the math but mining is probably going to be unprofitable soon. Even if it's never unprofitable, it'll be unavailable after all 21 million coins are generated in a few years. What will people use their hardware for then?
This would be pretty technically complex to create, but a webservice that used bitcoin to monetize spare cpu cycles like folding using bitcoin would be really cool. Pay the "workers" x btc/unit of work and accept work projects at x + p btc/unit of work, keep p. This will essentially allow people to sell spare computing power on the "open market", and there will be a lot of spare computing power available indeed in a few years.
