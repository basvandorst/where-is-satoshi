Ahh yes, the Winklevii.
I hate to think I'm enriching the rich, but at least they're not one of the already-existing megabanks.

I have a few bits in Changetip. I can't be bothered with crypto, wallets, and paranoia-level security. AFAIC, and I'm not into becoming a Bitcoin nerd. Until it's as easy to use as an ATM, I can't be bothered. So can I just add some real dollars to my Changetip account and I'm golden, or must I wait for the Apple of the bitcoin realm to come along and cater to my laziness? Serious answers only please--Thank you!

That's what I meant. Should I just pump up my Changetip account (by spending a significant amount of money in "real dollars" to buy bitcoin) and use it as my bitcoin account, avoiding all the technical BS and security minutiae of wallets, etc.? Is this a viable way to get involved in buying, holding, and using/spending bitcoin? What am I missing if I go that route?

From what I hear about exchanges being robbed by their owners or putting one's trust in a paper wallet or the integrity of a digital wallet that seems to be the equivalent of a mattress full of cash, I don't think there's any lack of (naive, IMO) trust in the system already.
I just want to own some BC, transact in it, and maybe speculate on its future value.

As a fellow unicyclist, damn, son. That's gonna chafe.

I understand they're also coated in oil due to no rain to wash it away...so drifting is a huge thing there.
