let the price rise.

This is disturbing.
@_date: 2016-04-29 16:42:15
This is great!

&lt;sipa&gt; i'd briefly like to talk about randomness
&lt;luke-jr&gt; that's random.
&lt;sipa&gt; we currently have 3 "levels" of randomness
&lt;wumpus&gt; we need a random number of levels of randomness

sounds like ur new to this
@_date: 2017-02-08 18:30:46
Well, "perfectly fine" is a bit exaggerated, don't u think?
@_date: 2017-02-25 17:34:34
and the price is falling
edit: sarcasm.
@_date: 2017-02-27 16:44:58
What's the difference between xthin and compact blocks?
@_date: 2017-02-16 15:39:18
I think u exagerate the amount of newly mined coins per day

That is not cold storage.

What he actually meant was: Many people will use Bitcoin without knowing it.
@_date: 2016-01-26 18:43:18

Well, not in the way China wants to do it.

Adam, thanks for the interview.
As u mentioned, satoshi wanted to "lock in" the base of bitcoin. Of course he didn't mean the 1 MB should be locked in forever: bandwidth and speed will be different in a few years than today than some years ago (I guess a 10 MB cap in 2009 would have been a centralization disaster)
Two questions. Do u agree with the above and did u find lukejr's hardfork bip too restrained or spot on?
And thanks for providing a look into the contracts of the independent developers at blockstream.
@_date: 2016-01-28 12:18:38


Hell yeah.
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:28:07


What a wrong statement.
Well, would be great if we could get his stance on this.
@_date: 2016-03-02 20:45:52

LN can exist without segwit
@_date: 2017-03-01 20:24:38
sry, i meant my post
@_date: 2017-03-07 08:55:44
China unbanned bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-01 18:28:40
indeed this is the problem here. i dont have logs. 
nullc could help here with his opinion.
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:44:30
btw just by hearing what and how he talks.
Now I googled him and saw that he looks indeed kinda like this guy. Fascinating.
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:06:38


I guess we need segwit asap. It seems core didn't expect fees to be that high right now...
@_date: 2017-03-29 14:43:00
Problem is, this design implicates miners know and understand everything to make rational decisions to increase their ROI.
Do they? And do they want to increase their ROI short-, mid- or longterm? Or, god forbit, to get the highest net present value?
@_date: 2016-01-15 12:36:40
@_date: 2017-03-07 16:36:18
I like it.
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:35:14
@_date: 2017-03-06 16:21:03
Indeed. I described it poorly.
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:54:27
They don't need anything, they can just fork when they think the timing is right.
@_date: 2017-03-01 16:37:30
I think ur wrong.
gmax explicitly said he wants it and I believe him.
@_date: 2016-01-16 17:02:58


yeah. no.
@_date: 2017-03-02 09:28:50
I created this post, am in favor of core and against BU.
wtf r u talking about
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:31:07
The continuance of the title is worth thinking about.
@_date: 2017-03-10 10:57:42
Segwit. Segwit. Segwit.

i am surprised he is surprised
@_date: 2017-08-07 18:24:36


Very nice.
@_date: 2016-11-13 10:33:03
What do u think r "enough nodes"?
@_date: 2016-12-26 15:21:24
unfortunately, i think he doesn't meant it as a joke.
@_date: 2015-08-13 18:00:11


@_date: 2015-08-05 10:10:59
Good luck with that. And btw, only up to 10,000€/year.
@_date: 2015-08-05 12:19:37
Actually, he said something like


@_date: 2015-08-05 19:50:53
Share some information please
edit: thanks
@_date: 2015-08-20 12:04:21
mindblowing ^^
@_date: 2015-07-24 13:54:08
@_date: 2017-04-19 13:36:04
Seems to be spot on.
@_date: 2017-04-12 17:31:52
@_date: 2016-02-10 20:49:41
Such a comparison doesn't matter. You clearly don't understand why bitcoin mining is the way it is.
@_date: 2017-04-23 17:03:06
@_date: 2016-02-01 16:24:03


Don't be so dramatic.
@_date: 2016-02-18 10:32:51
Interesting sound @ 49:27
@_date: 2017-04-02 17:30:32
@_date: 2016-02-21 10:03:02
Yes. Bigger blocks are part of a scaling strategy. It would
be dumb not to increase the size when the technology can handle it.
@_date: 2017-04-21 13:15:43
No fan about that voting process, but how about more RL communication between different stakeholders?
@_date: 2017-04-11 17:35:11
@_date: 2015-07-24 13:45:14
Otherwise it would be a nice explanation for his blacklisting.
@_date: 2017-04-16 17:13:37
@_date: 2017-04-19 12:18:50
What would the experts around here reply?
@_date: 2017-09-14 08:51:50
It's an opinion piece.
@_date: 2015-09-13 10:19:34
@_date: 2015-09-20 15:24:12
When will people understand this...

@_date: 2017-05-19 05:32:32
Gonna get interesting!
@_date: 2017-05-01 11:16:44


Only with blockchain, u can do marvelous things like that!
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:25:34


I highly doubt that.
@_date: 2017-05-07 07:43:08


@_date: 2015-10-02 04:32:48
Not that unlikely. Shitty programming.
@_date: 2017-05-16 14:46:35
Would like to read some comments of the supporters.

Roger claims double spends were less likely in the past when there wasn't a capacity problem and thus coffee was instantly available without waiting for confirmation. Something something.

Good vids but his last tweets r weird.
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:27:41
Btw I think this fork was enforced either by some creative dudes who want some extra btc for their bcc or by geniuses, who are in favor of 1mb btc (for now) and want to silence many anti-core people with this move.
@_date: 2017-05-07 09:25:05

Maybe u don't want to pay enormous fees in the future for ur coffee. Or Starbucks won't accept onchain transactions because of confirmation time.
@_date: 2017-06-28 11:58:23
Bitcoin is THE cryptocurrency on which every other was and will be based on (more or less) - it is the mother of all future currency system.
@_date: 2017-06-14 11:52:03
Thats bs. He's talking about segwit related patents.
