I just don’t agree that bitcoin is the only game in town. Ethereum is an outstanding project for example.
Yes, plenty of alt coins that are basically college projects that will die a quick and painful death, but there’s certainly more to this world than bitcoin.

This is mostly false. The senate committee used CBO baseline GDP growth predictions of 1.9% annually. They then found that the bill would add 0.6% to this for an adjusted growth rate of 2.5%....we've now sustained over 3% gap growth for a full year and private sector analysis has us remaining above 3% for the foreseeable future after tax reform becomes law. It's more likely that GDP growth will average between 3-4% throughout the next 3-5 years.
Tldr; Tax Reform will NOT add $1 trillion to the deficit.

Sad part about a large plurality of millennials is that they allow outside factors, which they have no control over, to dictate their future.
I have too many friends who just sit in the same job they took out of college and complain about a variety of things they can't control (student loan interest, rent, cost of healthcare, their boss being a dick, etc) . 
It's as if they are unaware that other cities and other industries exist. They want this job, in this city, at this salary at this rent....and if they don't get it it's because the man is out to get them.
Meanwhile i've moved 6 times in 9 years to pursue opportunities. I've  had shit jobs in cities with high rent. I've had the shitty bosses and crappy hours. I followed the opportunities and didn't wait for things i have no control over to shift in my favor. 
I'm not millionaire, but i'm comfortable enough now to be able to pay the rent, the student loans, etc and feel good about the future.
I suppose for some it's easier to feel better if they can convince themselves that a bad circumstance is someone else's fault. 
Tl;dr, if you live your life constantly blaming someone else for your bad circumstance, nothing will change and you'll always find yourself constantly in a bad circumstance.

This didn't age well.

Or I read the CBOs ten year growth projections, the senate report and current economic growth data. 
Feel free to do the same and come back with your own conclusion.
