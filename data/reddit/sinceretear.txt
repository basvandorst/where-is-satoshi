Cash app to hardware wallet?

Just curious. Holding 100k in bitcoin gives me massive anxiety not because it’s a lot of money but because of the ambiguity and options spread in this sub? Paper wallets, hardware wallets, cold storage wallets, exchanges (worst option). How do you personally like to HODL?
What if you do a firmware update on your cold storage wallet and it forgets your private keys or something?

Probably just $1,000 and add to it over time.

Very well thought out. I think your point is valid. Right now the majority of investors just don’t want to miss out on something that COULD one day stabilize like this. Practical applications like you said are still needed.

Who is the guy speaking? What are his credentials? Just wondering.

So is Gemini a better choice to hold Bitcoin long term? Or what would you suggest or where can you point me. Thanks.

Yes cashapp has a small 2% fee. Bitcoin can swing 2% daily so it’s not bad and I’m going to try coolwallet S. Most people on here like trezor but it’s fugly IMO.

Can you buy on electrum as well?

To be fair I don’t care about owning the coin. If bitcoin goes up 10x I just want to be able to cash out to USD.

Why coinbase vs Gemini?

It’s a bitcoin wallet not a coin
