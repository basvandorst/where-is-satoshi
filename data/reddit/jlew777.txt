The dog hangs out in front of the pet grooming shop on the left, in the photo.
Apparently, everyone in Bali knows not to mess with the street dogs.   And now I know it too.

I’m not the original poster (oh so that’s what OP stands for)... so I did not take that photo.
I recognize that bitcoin facade because, the other night, I had a chicken dinner at the restaurant next door - to the right and not in frame.
To the left of the bitcoin building is a pet grooming shop. In front of that shop was a white street dog. A group of dogs actually. 
I reached down to touch the dog and say “hello.” The dog snarled at me and showed his teeth. He didn’t actually bite me.
I believe, in dog language, he said to me, “get the fuck away from me!”

Yes. And that worries me. It’s unstable and risky. It goes against my HODL philosophy.

I know this place... It is next to the hotel that I’m currently staying at. (Jalan Nakula)
It is my understanding that the Indonesian government has banned crypto trading. 
I think this is an “old “ storefront.
Watch out for that white dog that’s to the left....just out of the picture...
It bites!

I’ve been noticing a lot of advertisements recently on YouTube and broadcast radio pushing the idea of investing in “stock options and futures”. It’s odd because the ads are aimed at a non-sophisticated audience. To a newcomer, the “stock market” as an investment choice, is more familiar than cryptocurrency. Perhaps someone is trying to persuade new investors to choose the “familiar” stock market, rather than that “crazy” bitcoin.

“Coinbase Pro” is the exchange. “Coinbase” is the wallet.
Are you advocating NOT using an online wallet? (Sorry. I’m fairly new at this)

Agreed. I want to see if their advice is credible before I do anything.

This assumes that this employer still has the proper quantity of BTC still in his account.

Oh. I see.... cheers.
