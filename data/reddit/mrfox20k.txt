How much will Wall Street effect crypto's in 2018??? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:09:14
I think we are about to be in a bear market... downhill from here to 8-10k then all up from there 
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:28:46
How will this effect the price? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:08:53
What 
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:13:07
I sold because I took a profit and now I'm ready for the next drop 
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:28:36
Yeah that's ridiculous.. It's good people for becoming largely interested with crypto's, just wish the exchanges were able to work properly right now! Might just wait till January 15th for bitfinex 
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:12:03
We just completed the head and shoulders pattern and I think it's going down from here 
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:25:26
Lol, you live and you learn!! 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:40:34
I have no clue... yeah I'm trying to jump into ripple! They are supposed to have an announcement before the new year.. some are saying it could be a partnership with Amazon 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:37:34
Exactly what I was thinking.. I was going to make an account on Bitfinex but you can't open an account with them till like January 15th
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:24:56
Damn, I'd like to know that too..
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:26:11
Nope :-)
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:45:35
That's true.. the price seems to be slipping at the moment 
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:09:39
Were all the packages delivered? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:33:33
Like where? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:47:24
Keep hodling!!! That 3k will be worth much much more!
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:22:12
Anyone think the price is gonna drop anymore? Or is it going straight up for now? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:04:33
I missed jumping in yesterday morning... I'm hoping it'll slide to 10k soon! 
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:26:28
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:44:58
Yeah but honestly I just want to jump in before the announcement because then there will be more hype and Amazon will have their name next to it! I've been checking stellar out too!! I wanted to get some of both!! 2018 will be a huge year for ALL crypto's! 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:45:49
Yes it's gonna drop more or yes the price is going up for now? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:01:02
Yeah I thought the same thing when I first heard of it.. Did you or your friends ever invest?? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:51:23
Papa John's sucksss 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:03:24
The real dip is about to happen.
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:21:47
I had 20k put aside for Bitcoin in September and never got verified for a coinbase account so I stopped putting in effort... then when i heard it hit 10k I figured a drop was coming... dropped to $9,300 and kept going up... feel like such a dumbass because I didn't wanna buy at ATH's... 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:34:50
Same thing happened to me this morning.. Some people told me it could take a couple days.. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:37:36
You mean some exchanges or? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:32:31
I'm curious as well.. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:35:18
I always wanted to order something from that website but never did.. was too afraid the FBI would show up 
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:22:25
Wow... I guess hearing about crypto's back in the early days has its positives and negatives.. especially hearing a lot of people had bitcoins stolen/lost
