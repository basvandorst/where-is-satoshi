I'm glad he realizes that the GCHQ is worse.

I mean, something that is "anonymous" is going to be inherently filled with people like that.
@_date: 2013-10-07 12:29:32
You can't just "seize" them you idiots. They aren't a physical thing.

I seriously hope Amazon accepts BitPay sooner or later.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:43:38
Why oh why didn't I mine bitcoins in 2009. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:30:13
Basically this sub went from good to shit really quickly.
@_date: 2013-09-13 01:20:35
I'd love it if Amazon itself accepted Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-09-16 21:10:37
They won't though. Maybe we (bitcoin users) should create it.

He's a fucking idiot. He won't understand.
@_date: 2013-10-04 01:39:43
It seems someone really doesn't like bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-06-23 14:01:39
Aaand this is why I need to invest into some bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-02 00:37:28
@_date: 2013-11-02 01:38:42
I didn't say that. I meant I wish Amazon would accept it and I also wish my friends would accept it directly.
@_date: 2013-10-11 13:23:19
Amazon and DigitalOcean.
@_date: 2013-11-01 16:43:02
Now all I need is Amazon and my friends to accept bitcoin and that will be it.
@_date: 2013-07-04 11:56:38
I seriously need to get some bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-09-26 15:48:38
I already use it in Ubuntu.
@_date: 2013-11-08 11:50:46
This will never happen where I live. They don't even know what bitcoin is.
@_date: 2013-09-02 15:43:56
I seriously need to buy some BTC.
@_date: 2013-10-07 13:05:24
Well I guess.
@_date: 2013-10-25 23:27:03
Well done, my friend.
@_date: 2013-11-06 09:23:31
@_date: 2013-06-17 20:35:17
Please never use tinypic.

What the fuck are you doing, Blockchain?
