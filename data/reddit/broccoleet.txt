What we need is a truly idiot-proof decentralized exchange with a great UI and good fiat pairs that doesn't make you feel like you'll get shanked when making a trade. A man can dream...

Can you elaborate for us on why you think this?

Pretty hard question to answer, but basically, because people are willing to spend that much. The perceived value of a "bitcoin" has gone up, likely due to a multitude of reasons and contributing factors. I think cryptocurrencies are just becoming more common and finally reaching the mainstream/media, which raised their inherent value. Then it started this sort of snowball effect with Bitcoin especially since it was the most established. Like most booms, everything started clicking at the right time - and all of a sudden now everyone and their grandma wants a Bitcoin.

"Now" is always the best time with crypto as long as you're willing to invest only what you could affordably lose.

There's currently a good thread on the front page right now about how to avoid the fees if you use coinbase:
Just invest if you're willing. There's no better time than the present. No one knows what will happen but if you look at the data, bitcoin continues to grow each year despite its fluctuations.

By regulating it, centralizing it and connecting it more with fiat

This is a top notch comment, and I really enjoyed reading it!

No one knows. Do your research and determine what's best for you. The safest option is to invest whatever you're willing to lose and let it sit, and not worry about day trading unless you have a lot of money to throw around. The common consensus around here is to continue letting your investment sit despite the massive climbs.

The price went up. That doesn't change the fact that the original intention of bitcoin, to act as a digital currency, would be severely jeopardized if it was criminalized by governments. A currency can't function if it is not adopted and confidently utilized by the mainstream.

Can you elaborate ? How is it more centralized than Bitcoin? Genuinely curious, would like to learn.

The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that the state of entropy of the entire universe, as an isolated system, will always increase over time....so that heat isn't just coming back, it's coming back as more.

"Stable crypto" sounds like a bit of an oxymoron at the moment after seeing what is happening to bitcoin during its growth recently, but only time will tell. Good luck, and check out ethereum if you haven't already!

It could be, but ultimately it's still a more secure and less convoluted method of possessing and transacting currency comapred to fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:45:15
Is this really new people selling though ? Most of the “fomo” investors are likely still waiting for their first buys to process...
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:47:13


Do you have money you're willing to lose? If  so, invest whatever you're willing to lose. 
The one thing you shouldn't do is cash out. It's $60 which is still basically nothing. Might as well let it sit and continue to grow, bitcoin grows practically every year despite its dips.

People like him are likely the reason you'll make any significant profits going forward. People are dumb with their money, don't let it get to you.

I love how they mention the legitimacy of bitcoin as a currency, and then go on to shill their pizza hut reward points.
