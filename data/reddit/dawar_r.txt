When Bitcoin was nothing, some guy took a huge risk and invested money into these “fake internet coins” with nothing but a belief in the technology. What’s more is that he kept that faith alive through all the difficult and uncertain times, taking on huge risks and tolerating volatile markets. Bill Gates is worth almost as much as the entire market cap for Bitcoin and we don’t ask him to split his earnings. In fact what did he really do? He bought (not invented) an operating system and was clever enough to license it to IBM in a very lucrative way. Why should early pioneers of Bitcoin deserve any less then that when they too shaped the future of this incredible technology.

If you believe in the technology, invest. The way Bitcoin is designed (limited supply/deflation) it will always be a profitable investment. So do you research, if the technology behind it makes sense and looks like something that will stand the test of time, buy lots and buy soon.

I didn’t say it’s fast now, just that it’s possible and one of the major goals. It will continue to improve with time, like all technology.

What's funny is people were asking this exact question a few hours ago at $6500 XD
...My guess is it'll plow through until $8000 at this momentum...

With the amount of time people spend on reddit, there really isn’t enough bitcoin news happening everyday to fill the front page and keep it relevant/interesting. This sub would be a lot less active without a mix of both relevant/useful articles and just a shit-ton of funny/crazy memes sprinkled all around. It gives the sub character and culture, if we wanted strictly news we’d be searching for the  tag on a popular news website. How fun is that?

I hope we do, it would be a great chance to buy more before future ATHs.

I'd say if it's any more than the cost of a hardware wallet itself, like a Ledger Nano S is around $96 USD so if you have around $200 you should probably get one.

This....is actually very sound advice.

I like this way of thinking. There’s 1000s of arguments for and against Bitcoin, but they really all boil down to this one fact. If you believe in the technology there shouldn’t be a question left.

1) Bitcoin does have some intrinsic value. For example, in the current state of the Bitcoin network it costs miners ~$1000 to mine 1 Bitcoin. They won't be selling it for any less then that just to cover there costs. 
2) Even if Bitcoin doesn't have intrinsic value, neither does fiat currency if you really think about it. Just like fiat its value is determined by what people are willing to trade for it, and it looks like right now people are wiling to trade a lot for Bitcoin. Also Bitcoin has corrections from time-to-time but the general direction is clearly upwards.
3) The real value of Bitcoin comes from the technology behind it and just how useful it is as a currency. Little-to-no fees, near-instant transactions, no third-party or middleman required, deflationary, proven track record, etc. These all add to the value of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange. Think about Bitcoin more like software. What is Facebook, Google Search and Uber at the end of the day? Just a bunch of code in your phone or computer, but what it can do for you is so much more valuable, and that's why these companies are worth billions today. Because they provide value through software, just like Bitcoin does. Even though it doesn't feel "real" the impact is clear and far-reaching. Bitcoin itself has a market cap larger than most businesses in the world today. That is real, tangible, valuable. 
Don't let it's peculiarity lead you to believe it's not something real and valuable. It most definitely is, and from the evidence it looks like it's here to stay for the foreseeable future.

Bitcoin transactions are instant. What you’re talking about is validation of a transaction. I mentioned them as 2 distinct features.
