What happens when the hardware wallet gets stolen, are the bitcoins lost for good? Is keeping multiple hardware wallets as backups possible, and if so recommended? what is a multi-sig hardware? TIA.

Govt. is just a puppet for those who own the banks.  They will eventually get to decide what to do with bitcoin, and the govt. sugar babies will follow their marching orders, for basically what amounts to a chump change for those pulling the strings.

To a novice there seems to be a lot of those silly mistakes that can happen in bitcoin management, and then some more dangers you didn't even know about or have anticipated.  Many would shy away from such risks. What's your take on the risks involved in bitcoin ownershp?

But, the govt did get their grubby hands on OP's bitcoins.  How do you mean by govt. can never touch it? (stupid question, new to bitcoin).

That guy maybe scheming something. Prolly influenced by a lot of prodding and noise from China.

Sorry, new to bitcoin.  How does that work, the police got her 'puter but they don't have access to her bitcoins?

So, private key is the one guarding your wallet from the govt or a thief? How safe are they? How difficult is it to crack a key? How difficult would it be if a supercomputer or a quantum computer is used? 
So, even if you're a legit owner of bitcoin, it would be wise to have multiple wallets rather than a single wallet?
I've heard about lost bitcoins due to a shady exchange(?) shutting down and the owner of said exchange stealing peoples' bitcoins. What exactly is happening there? Based on that, Bitcoin doesn't seem like a very safe way to store money?
(sorry for the newbie questions.  you don't need to bother answering them if not so inclined.) TIA.

I'm certain oligarchy with ties to the banks will have their sugar baby politician lackeys to pass laws to maintain their status quo.
@_date: 2017-06-16 06:45:01
Politicians are disposable asset to the oligarchy, easily disposed of and replaced.  (Obviously, I am not talking about countries run by dictators or military strongman, such as Russia.)
@_date: 2017-06-15 09:00:32
You got the order mixed up, state of welfare is at the bottom of the list.  It's all about the oligarchy throwing loose change at the sugar baby politicians to maximize their wealth.

banks don't get burned, they just have their sugar baby politicians transfer tax dollars over to them.
