Text: Earlier today, Mt.Gox released a press release highlighting the “Transaction Malleability" issue with the Bitcoin protocol.  Gavin Andresen, Lead Developer of the Bitcoin protocol later released a statement confirming that this is not a problem with the Bitcoin protocol, but is a challenge for creators of bitcoin wallet software (like Coinbase).
The malleability issue would allow an attacker to change the identifier of a transaction (but not the sender or recipient of bitcoin, amounts, or other information).  If not accounted for carefully, this could lead some wallets to duplicate transactions.
After conducting a review of our wallet software, we could not find any instances of such an attack being used. We also looked into the technical details of the transaction malleability issue and just this morning added additional security measures to our software to further prevent such an attack. From our current analysis, there weren’t any users affected by this issue, but we’ll continue to monitor transactions to make sure.  If you have any questions about a transaction on your account you can contact support.
Bitcoin is a truly exciting space to be in. Every day, more and more consumers and merchants are experiencing the value of bitcoin - simple, instant transactions - exactly what payments should be in the age of the Internet. With nearly 1M consumer wallets and over 23,000 merchants on our platform, Coinbase will continue to stay vigilant and do everything we can to make Bitcoin as easy as possible for customers.

Coinpunk's Response to Apple for Removal of Blockchain App
Apple has just pulled the last and biggest Bitcoin wallet from the App Store: Blockchain.
Blockchain being pulled from the app store proves what we've been saying all along: Apple isn't banning Bitcoin apps because of "legal grounds" (nobody is talking about making Bitcoin illegal), they're banning Bitcoin apps to anti-competitively prop up their own payments service. Because Blockchain's wallet and Coinpunk are HTML5 apps, we are the last Bitcoin wallets that can be used on the iPhone because you can use our wallets via Safari, which Apple can't block.
Bitcoin users, we need your help. We need you to take a stand against Apple, make noise, complain, and show Apple that there will be consequences to their actions. Now, only Coinpunk and Blockchain's HTML5 apps work on the iPhone.
Coinpunk needs your help to continue working on Coinpunk to ensure Apple can't stop Bitcoin. Contribute to our crowdfund campaign, help us fight Apple, help us provide universal Bitcoin adoption for everyone in the world.
Sign the petition to Apple to stop blocking Bitcoin wallet apps

Nice, succinct explanation of so-called Gox premium:
“We can interpret [the Gox premium] as a measure of fear on the part of customers that they’re not going to get their money back. Their desperation is measured by how much they’re willing to pay for bitcoin [on Gox],” said Garrick Hileman, an economic historian at the London School of Economics.

In recent weeks, the site has been having trouble with withdrawals, and actually all Bitcoin withdrawals have been halted.
Users of Mt. Gox can withdraw real currency, but to do that they'd have to sell their Bitcoins on Mt. Gox to someone willing to have theirs frozen on the site until the technical issues are fixed.
This has caused a huge plunge in price on the exchange, to the mid $200s. Meanwhile, Bitcoins that are traded elsewhere remain in the mid-$600s. If you are brave, you can buy a Bitcoin on Mt. Gox on the hope that things become unfrozen and make a huge profit. The massive gap obviously reflects a panic and a lack of faith in the site's ability to reconnect with the broader market.
Essentially, Mt. Gox has become Cyprus. Remember, in early 2013, when the Cypriot financial system collapsed, the Eurozone imposed massive haircuts on Cypriot bank accounts (confiscating cash) and instituted capital controls, preventing people from withdrawing their cash and moving it to non-Cypriot banks. For awhile, there was talk about a normal Euro and a Cypriot Euro. And a Cypriot Euro was worth less, because you couldn't move it out of Cyprus easily, or if you did want to move money out, you probably had to pay huge fees to do so through illicit mean.
So that's the deal today with the two prices of Bitcoin. There's the normal Bitcoin price and the price of a Bitcoin that's frozen on a site with severe technical problems. If Mt. Gox gets everything fixed, prices should find parity. But the large gap in price reflects a lack of confidence that things will be sorted out soon.

You need to show actual malice if the person being libeled is a public figure. If not a public figure, then the standard comes down to whether what was said was false AND damaging to him in the eyes of the public. So for Dorian to win he will have to PROVE by a preponderance of the evidence (ie - better than 50-50 odds) that he's not Satoshi. This could get very interesting.

i think a disclosure-based regulatory system is fine.  the regulators shouldn't get in the middle of a transaction and substitute their own judgment for that of the consumer.  instead, let them attach a list of warnings to the side of every Bitcoin ATM and allow the consumer the freedom to choose whether to proceed in light of the warnings.

new website looks much improved over existing one, but unclear without being able to sign in what features are different.  probably doesn't matter for the vast majority of folks who will be seeing it for first time in this new incarnation and will just have a slick, straightforward way to go about their business.

thanks for posting it.  i would have thought this story would quickly rise to the top of this subreddit's "hot" list, but seems so far to have been lost in the shuffle.  Certainly merits our attention.  Maybe a snappier title: Member of Fed Reserve Sizing up Bitcoin "Risks"

transcript of portion of video discussing bitcoin: 
Jeffrey Lacker, Richmond Federal Reserve President: "it's private money. they're going to have trouble gaining market share if its value's going to fluctuate so much. but it'll be interesting to watch."
CNBC host: "but what is the position of the fed from a policy perspective if there is one? or what do you think the position of the u.s. government should be on bitcoin. or other virtual currencies."
Jeffrey Lacker, Richmond Federal Reserve President: "that's -- for what they're doing, it's a free market and i don't see why they have an interest in stopping it. at this point."

Congratulations, guys.   
Glad to read in the article that you have someone described as a "money-services veteran" participating in the round.  The regulatory/ banking aspect of BTC is biting many a Bitcoin entrepreneur in the ass in recent days, and glad to see you have this hurdle squarely in your view on the critical path of shit that, however unpleasant, needs to get done.

anyone catch this: "In part because of his growing frustration with the performance of MtGox, which suffers from an aging infrastructure that is hard-pressed to handle the growing volume of Bitcoin transactions, **Vessenes forced a partnership agreement with MtGox** earlier this year whereby CoinLab would become the primary Bitcoin exchange for customers in the United States."

it's easy to transfer money into an offline wallet.  as long as you have the public address of the offline wallet, you can use any online wallet or bitcoin client to send money to that address.

so awesome.  and sort of unique to Bitcoin. imagine the alternative:  flashing a checking account and routing # or a personal address
@_date: 2013-06-19 21:21:35
backing could mean a lot of things.  it could mean their venture arm contributed financing to a bitcoin startup.  or it could mean they are partnering with a startup on an operational level. the latter would be much more interesting.

1PDyES38KkYF1mpodXXV5uexkAPXUcvogQ is the "send from" wallet.  1CxA1f3VUFzbmLTBtS8QpCNrRnZf4LQnuW is the "send to" wallet.    actually, it was a private key import via blockchain from the 1PDyES38KkYF1mpodXXV5uexkAPXUcvogQ to 1CxA1f3VUFzbmLTBtS8QpCNrRnZf4LQnuW.  in blockchain wallet, it shows the new balance (i.e., +0.15).  but it's not showing up in the Blockchain itself.

this is an awesome idea.  yes, this could conceivably be done with other electronic forms of payment, but seems more natural with bitcoin -- you can associate different shipping addresses with different public keys and as a consumer decide on the fly which public key/shipping address combo to use for a given purchase.

not familiar with "bit rot" -- sounds like the data getting corrupted over time solely through the passage of time?  if that's so, then buying a new thumb/ cd-rom and performing the backup every year or 2 should fix it?

Yes I can defintely see Maher having one of the Bitcoin "talking head" types on the show for that segment before the moderated panel discussion. I can see Maher being a supporter once he actually acquires a kernel of knowledge about bitcoin - he obviously knows jack shit at this point.

my take is that Mark from MtGox is a well-intentioned and gifted, but bumbling techie geek.  Peter Vessenes of CoinLab, on the other hand, seems more of your classicly conniving opportunist douche.  but i've been wrong before.  eager to see what other facts come to light.

no brainer for retail businesses to accept bitcoin so long as they can save a point or two on credit card processing fees + no chargebacks

this zeroblock acquisition is kind of a let down.  when they said 'big announcement' relating to a killer app, i was thinking they would be taking bitcoin to the next level by implementing one or more of the advanced features Satoshi baked into the bitcoin protocol itself - escrow, contracts, rule-based transfer of funds between parties, etc.   the zeroblock acquisition is far from that.
