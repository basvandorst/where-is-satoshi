Luckily the social exchange CoinTouch won't be affected as it doesn't get involved in transactions:
Keep it P2P, folks.

With localbitcoins you deal with strangers. I believe dealing with friends (or friends of friends) should remove the need for escrow. Also removes the need to meet strangers with a wad of cash in your pocket! ... and also saves paying a fee to localbitcoins

CoinTouch is a young site (went live in March of this year). Give it time, and connect up both G+ and FB. Two degrees of social separation encompasses a lot of people. 
Spread the word on social networks, and you'll see your CoinTouch order book grow in no time.

I think a mobile app for CoinTouch would work well - the signup and messaging side would be much more seamless than via the web.

CoinTouch will never auto-post. That's a cast iron promise. I hate sites that do that.

CoinTouch has been running for six months now, and finds friends of friends that trade all major crypto currencies. 
It combines both the Facebook and Google social graphs:
It's free-of-charge and transactions are P2P.

CoinTouch helps you buy and sell bitcoins within your extended social network (Facebook and now also Google+). 
Prices are pegged to market rates, at your chosen spread, and thus automatically update every minute. CoinTouch transactions are truly peer-to-peer and there are no fees or delays.
CoinTouch can price in all major world currencies and altcoins. Currently supports Facebook and Google login - LinkedIn coming soon. 
I'd appreciate your thoughts

You can now find friends of friends that trade altcoins on CoinTouch. 
Pricing in all major currencies supported.
BTC-altcoin pricing coming soon. Let me know how you get on. Cheers!

There are no fees. You pay the price quoted by your friends, which could be above or below the market rate depending on how competitive they are.

This is my site, developed in Scala/Play/Neo4J/Mongo/Nginx. Add bids and offers for bitcoins, trading either GBP, USD or EUR. Prices are shown at a spread from exchange prices (thus updated automatically every 60 seconds). Currently supports Facebook login. Google and LinkedIn coming soon.
I'd appreciate your thoughts

there are other ways of tracking friendships - uploading an address book etc. But you're right, FB's shutdown is a big loss for apps like CoinTouch.

CoinDesk made a big deal of GetBits, which CoinDesk founder Shakil Khan is an investor in. They ignored CoinTouch, a superior competitor I created six months earlier.
Obviously they removed my comment to remind them of the existence of alternatives.
Don't bother with CoinDesk if you're interested in real, balanced, news in the Bitcoin world.

With CoinTouch (my own site) you can find friends of friends that trade cryptocurrency, and then trade directly with them, P2P:
I believe the social graph is the future of finance. Implicit "KYC" without handing over your fingerprint / passport scan to a central authority.

Use a service like CoinTouch, which finds friends of friends that trade crypto currency. It's safer than MtGox - all transactions are truly peer-to-peer, and handy to have a friend help with your first purchase.

From Facebook I get your a) email address b) name c) friend list (id, name, avatar). What do I gain from data mining this information?
@_date: 2014-03-13 10:48:03
Needs to include  which finds friends of friends that trade crypto currency.
