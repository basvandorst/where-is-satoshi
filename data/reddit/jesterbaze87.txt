This looks mighty optimistic... I mean I'm a fan but 110k is quite a jump.

Depends on what the sole survivor of this "everyone dies" event places the value at.
@_date: 2019-07-03 20:17:33
Sounds scammy, do some research before investing. If it does work though let me know please haha
@_date: 2019-11-24 07:31:21
Oh wow, I did not know that... yeah you make a good point. Thanks for sharing that!

We could push for 42,069.69? Cmon Reddit :)

Dude, I remember this. I was that crazy guy saying that "If it's a free service, it means they're selling *your* information." or telling people "If I can access company 'x', 'y', 'z's information, you think the government is unaware? They're watching you. (this was more in the wild-west super-nerd days of the internet)" 
I remember seeing the DOD scan my network when I searched something \*legal\* but umm... edgy on Google. I caught them on Wireshark, traced the IP to my local DOD office. The traffic was persistent and unusual, kept trying to scan my internal network... That was interesting, nothing came of it though. I was waiting for the Feds to come knocking, or getting a weird letter in the mail. (It was gun related information, I was just getting into buying some firearms and wanted to know the legality of things, and see what was available. I guess suppressed .50 cal rifles will trigger the DOD? I can explain more if you're super concerned...) 
Skip forward a few years from my pot-smoking conspiracy claims and we get releases from some whistle blowers about PRISM, and some rumblings about other companies harvesting data and tracking users. Then SOPA, then Facebook (among other govt. leaks courtesy of Snowden and Assange). Yeah, the citizens are losing this fight, hell the people never had a chance.
Thinking Crypto:  
Yeah they can trace us, they have caught many people already by following the blockchain transactions. If you make **ONE** screw up, you're identified. [Such as some pedo's that got busted](
This is also relevant:

I think the idea of Crypto is more the "Down with the broken ass system" notion than the "Hide all of my stuff and think I'm a 1337 H4x0r" idea. That is why I support Bitcoin still. Wish I kept those couple coins I mined back when bitcoin was just breaking the surface =(

Honestly, I hope that the corruption the government (and we the people) have created boils to a head and breaks down at some point... I’m amazed that with everything that has been revealed to us, there isn’t more action happening. That is amazing social engineering. No idea why people are so docile about forfeiting their rights, it’s weird to me.
As for being tracked, that is where I give up. Simply because again you’re right, you have to be 100% secure against attacks and leaks, both known and unknown. You can be damn good, but against a highly paid team of NSA nerds **waves to NSA** I really don’t think anyone will have 100% fool proof privacy in their activities. Not sure how they do it, my hunch is collaboration with ISPs, or just knowing about those zero day issues well before the masses find out. I feel your crazy talk haha. Not to mention if you have your privacy game 100% in check, there is such a thing as activity fingerprinting. They know your hours of activity, typical searches, normal website requests etc. provided you ever use the internet off of a VPN, logged into Google, Facebook, or Microsoft, or say, posted on Reddit... You would have to get into some real tinfoil hat territory to stay truly anonymous I believe. Anywho...
Bitcoin is a step in the right direction, I think with some nice tight privacy measures it would head for the moon, for both good and criminal reasons. Until the next privacy breach, or deeply nerdy bug is exploited, then is starts over again. It’s a strange world.

I don't know about Euros, but USD is backed by... oh yeah, nothing.
I had a coworker make this argument with me before. I just asked him "What backs the US dollar?..." He backed down haha.

So take your child porn stained coins, send to Monero (something like that... There are anonymous blockchain projects, I can't remember because I don't care if the govt. sees my transactions) network, then transfer back to BTC. Traces are now gone, you lost 0.5% on transfer fees, and life is good?
@_date: 2019-11-24 02:30:20
I completely agree, however if you aren't purchasing illegal good, firearms, child porn, etc. Does it really matter? Moreover, if you are purchasing those illegal goods, wouldn't you be smart enough to \*not\* use Bitcoin? There are plenty of blockchain style projects that are anonymous, or learn to anonymize your transactions.
(Short privacy rant below... TLDR: We lost the privacy battle / war.)
With that being said, we have lost the information privacy battle / war already, by a long shot. I have been an activist since [SOPA]( (Introduced 2011, activist since 2012). Our data has been harvested, more of it is being collected by any company that can get it's hands on it, we (the citizens) are doing nothing to stop it except crying about it on social media. Yes GDPR is doing great things, but we have a LONG ways to go... The worst part is that this issue has been in plain sight for ages, yet we didn't protest, we barely boycott, we all shrugged and said "Ah whatever." At this point, I still write my government officials on occasion but I've started to grow apathetic as well...

Silly banking mafias...

Oh hell yes. I got into Bitcoin a while back and thought 700 a coin was a bit much for my level of uncertainty about its future. I bought about 0.4BTC and spent 0.2 of it on crap. Now I deeply regret not getting a few coins and just HODL like I have been with my tiny balance.
@_date: 2019-06-24 13:27:54
Sounds scammy as hell. Move your coins to a wallet that you have control of, and private keys for.
@_date: 2019-06-07 08:09:10
I know that feeling all too well.
@_date: 2019-06-01 16:55:27
Just want to say that I love this post. It sounds idealistic that bitcoin will ever be untaxed. The political world we live in runs on greed. I could see a push for something like Monero or some untraceable crypto once the regulators totally lock down bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-07 15:02:23
Just a very obsessive topic. Like I said admittedly I acted the same for a while. Vegans, bitcoiners and atheists seem to have a strong need to announce their opinions very often. It’s hard to have normal conversations with these groups without some evangelistic campaign happening.
@_date: 2019-12-13 06:04:42
Ever consider offering a 10% discount for bitcoin payments or anything? That would be awesome for exposure. :)
@_date: 2019-12-07 05:22:52
Kind of reminds me of vegans. I acted that way when I started investing when BTC was around 700. I kept telling everyone it’s going to blow up, sink some money into BTC. Now it’s floating around mid 7k and I don’t say much.
@_date: 2019-06-17 14:29:08
Honestly that sounds like solid advice. I’m going to be converting some of my stocks over come the end of the month and investing more heavily in Bitcoin. Thanks for the feedback and have my upvote :)
@_date: 2019-12-13 06:26:57
Makes sense, I love that you have one of these ATMs and are willing to work with the people that have questions! Keep on kicking ass.
@_date: 2019-09-13 23:07:41
Wouldn’t doing this make you a money transmitter in the US? I mean I’m all for it but I don’t want any time in prison.
@_date: 2019-09-22 02:46:43
What country are you in, and what legal hurdles or legal documents did you have to deal with? I'm very interested.
@_date: 2019-09-16 18:35:15
Badass, I might try making one of these then.
@_date: 2019-09-13 17:27:21
Send me a copy when you have it all typed up! I’d love to read it.
@_date: 2019-09-18 02:22:45
Yeah basically right now IMO. You won’t regret it. Just be patient.
@_date: 2019-09-16 23:58:48
Haha no I was going to do my research first. Just keeping it positive. I remember reading about a guy in Detroit that got some time for doing Bitcoin to cash transactions or something of that nature. It does look like a fun project though. Maybe make one as a personal piggy bank or something.
@_date: 2019-05-27 22:46:02
This is so true
