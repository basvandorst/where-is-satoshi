He's a Tory, that's why.

While it's true Alberta is the conservative heartland of Canada. The American political system is so right shifted that Alberta would appear to be more left wing than overwhelming majority of the US. It's very hard to compare US and Canada politics in practice.

I have to disagree -- they are one of the most successful parts of our government. First, they have much better attendance than the lower house. Second, because they aren't constrained by seeking reelection they don't have to spend all their time bowing to the electorate. Instead they can investigate topics without just doing what the polls say. The result is they tend to produce excellent reports that form the basis of committees in the lower house. Likewise, to balance this, they have little power. They don't rubberstamp anything -- they simply don't have the power to do anything but slow bills down and since there is currently a conservative majority in the senate, they won't do that. In practice they usually play a positive non-partisan role in our society.

Senators aren't politicians in Canada or at least not in the traditional sense. They aren't elected and don't have to ever run for re-election. Likewise, they have very very limited power. They operate more as a set of distinguished citizens who make recommendations to the parliament. It's a little more complicated than that -- but it's a good way to think of it.

You are correct -- hence why I said it was a little more complicated than that. :) 
In practice their real power is more felt in their committees and reports.

There is an age limit for senators: 75. Also, I'm almost 40 and perfectly understand bitcoin.

Didn't the media hate Obama? I mean Trump doesn't get 10% of the hate from the media that Obama got.

Yup, this is a great video showing Trump is destroying America's democracy. All of these stations are owned by the Mercers: Tump's biggest backer. The same person who own Cambridge Analytica. It's amazing seeing all the propaganda stations pushing Trump's agenda. One candidate/party shouldn't have this much power.

It's a moderate centrist news comedian. Better than 90% of US news.

Sinclair Broadcasting owns 40% of the local news stations in the US.
They are insanely pro-Trump. Not to mention, Fox, the biggest US news outlet is insanely pro-Trump. You really need to check you math.
Yes, a couple of conservative news outlets like CNN and WaPo are anti Trump. But they are still pushing a conservative agenda. The US is famous for it's right-wing media.

The US has always been an oligarchy. It's never been a democracy. Learn your history. The colonists didn't want a revolution, they were loyal and fled to freedom -- the American Revolution was the creation of the landed oligarchs in the colonies against the will of the people. This is one of the reasons there is no left wing in the US. Just conservatives like Bush, Obama, Trump, and Clinton. 
Do some research. The people who own all these stations are literally the biggest bankrollers of Trump and the Republican party. And they also own Cambridge Analytica. Learn about Robert and Rebeka Mercer. The people who own the news and the fake news are the same.
Take the red pill and realize that the conservative oligarchs are out to get you. Only through socialism can America be made great.
