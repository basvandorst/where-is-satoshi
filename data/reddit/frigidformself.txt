Very nice! Gratz on your success!

Wow! That's very cool!  It sounds pretty awesome.  I use the Mycelium wallet app on my N5.  The wallet has been very stable and useful to me.  I am very interested in being able to print secure paper wallets!

Awesome work! I love seeing these for the week in science!  Good job!

I think the burning BTC is used as an option to quickly accrue reputation.  Early adopters would be able to slow build reputation over time like eBay.  
While I agree it's not perfect, I can't think of a better alternative.  
Having to burn BTC to quickly build rep to pull off a scam could be used if the amount of BTC burned ensured enough trust to profit from the scam even at the BTC cost.
It would almost be like a corporation doing something illegal to earn $1Billion in profit and then paying $100Million in fines.
But in this case, paying the $100 Million upfront to pull off the $1Billion scam.  
Like I said, it's not perfect but I'm not sure what a better alternative would be.  Although now that I've said all this it sounds less great.... Except to keep out minor scammers and trolls...
But even accounts with long standing reputations on websites can be purchased, so who knows.

Very awesome! I'm glad to see that you guys are continuing to develop this decentralized marketplace! 
@_date: 2014-06-02 10:40:54
I'm saving this! So well written!

I believe this was one of the issues that the new entropy device by mycellium was going to deal with.

That would be a pretty interesting event if someone were able to pull off a large scale Bitcoin only yard sale.  
It'd probably only work in the city with the most Bitcoiners.  Which makes me wonder what city has the most bitcoiners in it...

I am currently waiting for my 3D printer to arrive for this purpose among other fun things!
@_date: 2014-06-01 02:40:19
I'm super excited to read this article! What are your rates?  I'm interested in procuring your services for some of my wedding photo needs soon.  I live in RVA, so this is really cool!

I remember seeing a post where a kid was talking about farming steam cards to trade for dogecoin which he then took to exchanges and traded for BTC and other coins.  
Cryptocurrency removed that entry barrier he couldn't have normally gotten past via normal means.
We all could use a better understanding of finances, so I think it's cool that OP's having those conversations with his son.
@_date: 2014-06-29 06:11:28
Why thank you again good sir!
@_date: 2014-08-14 15:10:24
Pretty interesting to see io9 writing about that farm.  Thanks for linking it!
@_date: 2014-08-08 14:37:00
Yay! I read both of these! Great information! 
@_date: 2014-08-22 20:04:55
That's super cool! I'm a big fan of that show! 
@_date: 2014-05-16 19:55:50
Very interesting.  Thank you for taking the time to post here.  I'm from VA but not near your district.  I'm currently debating my options in regards to my candidates in my district.  I'm glad that you recognize cryptocurrency as a part of the future.
@_date: 2014-06-19 00:57:20
Did you ever receive your miners?  I'm curious because I'm currently in a discussion with ZoomHash here
 
regarding their shady business practices and they seem to enjoy shifting the blame.
It looks like my posts are currently being downvoted, come on and ......really?!?!
@_date: 2014-07-20 19:32:44
To dream the dream!
@_date: 2014-09-04 12:56:50
Interesting, as a non-coder would I still be able to help? If I wanted to help code for those projects what would you recommend?
@_date: 2014-09-01 15:53:35
I really like those week in Bitcoin posts; those and the week in technology posts.
@_date: 2014-08-03 03:32:43
Wow!  Very unfortunate! Sorry to hear about this.  That's a good deal on the ATM, I hope someone is able to put it to good use! 
@_date: 2014-09-01 15:58:01
 The moronic Monday sticky is definitely a good idea.
I enjoy the stickied discussion posts, like the one on r/bitcoinmarket.  But, I do agree that not as much discussion goes on there compared to the sticky post on bitcoinmarkets.
@_date: 2014-06-29 16:27:47
Good idea! I'll check it out! I'm going to bookmark your website.
@_date: 2014-06-21 18:19:21
Idk why I was surprised by the amount of moon comments, lol.
That thing looks legit! If you find something new you should call it a "bit planet"!
@_date: 2014-06-29 14:07:28
Awww, that's nice! I'll make sure to pass these on and spread the kindness!
@_date: 2014-06-29 05:58:45
Awww, thank you badger of potato's! I hope you have a great day! 
@_date: 2014-08-28 20:13:34
I appreciate all the hard work you and your team have done to create this decentralized open market!
 I thought the idea of having to burn some BTC to jumpstart your reputation as a way to avoid serial scammers is an interesting approach.
I believe that decentralization will be a key part of the future.   
Thanks again for picking up and continuing to develop where Darkmarket left off and bringing us OpenBazaar!
@_date: 2014-09-13 14:34:00
Very cool! Still waiting on mine! Can't wait!
@_date: 2014-08-09 15:25:28
Thank you for the original link and thank you to the commenter who posted the full article!
@_date: 2014-08-15 15:28:58
We still love you

This made me laugh; but seriously I think we're reaching this point faster than we think.
Basic income through technology is the future I'm hoping for; that sweet sweet Star Trek future.
@_date: 2014-06-29 06:00:59
Oh wow! Holy shit! That's the first time someone has actually given me a changetip! I didn't even realize! So cool! 
@_date: 2014-07-04 03:04:09
Thank you for reminding me that I need to help fund that entropy! Keep up the good work!
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:30:37
Cool job guys! I had previously downloaded the alpha of darkwallet and thought it looked pretty legit!
I am definitely going to be keeping tabs on this project!
No questions really, just saying that you guys are awesome!

If you check r/bitcoinmarkets it looks like a bot broke on btc-e last night.

I'm going to save this for later!!!!  I'm already looking at using a photographer that accepts Bitcoin to do my wedding photos next year.  I wonder if I could pay for an entire wedding in Bitcoin....hmmmm.....
@_date: 2014-06-19 20:03:06
I am definitely interested in helping to test or anything!
Honest question, where would I even begin to start if I wanted to learn how to program anything involving this?
@_date: 2014-06-19 20:18:23
Awesome! Thanks for the information! You guys are the best!

Hm, triple crossing in Richmond you say? I don't drink, but I might go over and buy some beers for friends in Bitcoin!

I had no idea that two spaces were incorrect until this very post.  I'm super upset.
