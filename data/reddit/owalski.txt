Thanks. It's that simple. I wondered if there are some established approaches to the topic of lost coins in that context. However, I see your point that the metric is not that useful so maybe it's just less interesting discussion than I thought.

First of all, Core is not a group of people. It's a process. Anybody can participate. Yes, Blockstream does but so can Coinbase. So, can you. That's the key misconception, I believe.
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:34:06
It doesn't matter. The market cap indicator is total BS. Who cares what's the market cap of coins printed out of thin air? Only PoW coins without premine or instamine could make a more reasonable comparison. However, even then it's just not a very accurate tool to measure a success of a cryptucurrency.

There is a small chance that you will find a block during the time you are verifying transactions of the new block. So the miner downloads and verifies the new block but in a meantime, tries to find an empty block what sometimes happens.

No on-chain solution will outcompete Paypal and VISA. There are people understanding that from the beginning and those that need to see Lightning Network to believe. That's all.
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:09:08
All miners can do that. With my understanding, it's not such a bad thing since the block is mined in a time that the miner cannot mine a full block yet anyway.

Who "they"? Miners can add whatever transactions they want including adding none. There are just more incentives to fill the block. Most of the time.

Sure. Bitcoin was there when nobody was using it. When Bitcoin will cost $1M, even 1 satoshi fee will be more expensive than VISA. You cannot beat VISA with fees because for the majority of consumers VISA transfers are free. Only stuff like Lightning Network can compete with it.

The main issue we have is that people are impatient. Lightning Network is on the way and with its cheap and fast TXs, it will make BCH a poor joke. Just let developers work instead of blocking protocol updates and making noise in social media. We know the problem, we know the solution, we are working on it. Keep calm. Bitcoin is doing great.

Why do you believe OTC is good for you? The market will find the price anyway. Spikes don't matter. And to be honest, I prefer when the price is discovered transparently so anybody can participate, instead of some "behind the scene" deals. By the way, it's a great opportunity for regular people who missed the train to buy more Bitcoins.

Satoshi is the Bitcoin creator but he's not a god. His code had bugs (he probably also farted sometimes). Bitcoin is bigger than Satoshi and as an open-source project is now created by many talented people. Some of them are way better programmers. I'm sure he is (or would be) very proud of what the Core has done.
@_date: 2017-02-26 02:36:29
You can use Legder with your Mycelium wallet what I strongly recommend. Without a hardware wallet I keep no more than the value of $100. It's like a cash in your pocket.
@_date: 2017-02-05 12:09:24
Sure. I have no problem with people expressing their opinions. Just stop using fake accounts to pretend you're more credible than you are. That said:
There are many participants in the Bitcoin network. They all play their part. However, when miners claim they know better technical solution than Core, I don't buy it at all. Bigger blocks give miners better incentives. That's all. It's all about money. They're not idealists looking for "the original Bitcoin as Satoshi intended". Bullshit. The only reason they don't accept Segwit is that it doesn't give them direct profits. Period.
They surely have a vote but ignore the fact that attacking stability may cost them way more than miner fees. Especially, if as a result, the Bitcoin price will drop massively.
@_date: 2017-02-03 21:48:51
It's the first time Litecoin will be useful: as a Bitcoin testnet.  I don't expect the Litecoin price will go up in the long-term, though. People expected the same before Litecoin halving and it didn't happen.
@_date: 2017-02-05 11:45:04
I have the same approach.
@_date: 2017-02-05 22:25:41
1. It's really hard to treat BU seriously if their main argument is obviously flawed. Fees do not stop the adoption. I've never hesitated to pay with BTC because of the fee. Traditional international transfers are way more expensive, the anonymity is also worth more etc. Roger Ver claims that there are people waiting to "get in" but fees are too high for them. That's simply ridiculous.
2. When it comes to SegWit… it seems to be an ego play. SW helps to solve the same problem but BU does not support it for sake of doing things their way. I don't get it. It's sad.
@_date: 2017-02-05 12:13:06
But Core is already working on increasing the block size (and many other things). BU is just a mess for unclear reasons.

@_date: 2017-02-28 01:56:27
Are you aware that Roger is not a technical person and his opinions about technical aspects of Bitcoin are kind of naive?
@_date: 2017-02-05 11:55:40
Not necessary. There are people believing that core is evil and BU is great.  However, creating fake accounts to play "long time bitcoiner" is simply dumb. I cannot wait to see "Satoshi Nakamoto here. BU all the waaay!" 
@_date: 2017-02-28 20:47:05
Right now merchants do not accept Bitcoin for many reasons. I'm sure that the fee is extremely rarely one of them. By the way, you've never  paid for a traditional transaction because the whole fee is on the seller (and it's bigger than in Bitcoin right now – yep).
@_date: 2017-02-05 12:30:19
It's less risky to stay on both chains. That's a fact.
@_date: 2017-02-27 14:09:44
Two non-technical people discussing one of the most advanced Bitcoin updates so far. At least, Tone admits that he's not an expert and simply trusts developers but it's still crazy. I'm especially disappointed with using old Satoshi posts as arguments. Bitcoin is not a Satoshi's private repository. It's a community project with many participants and Satoshi is not one of them for years now. By treating Satoshi like a prophet in 2017, Roger seems to completely miss the idea of open-source. The Bitcoin vision from 2008 doesn't matter anymore because the project evolved according to a huge amount of new data and development. Why Roger is doing so much instead of staying quiet and simply letting it grow.
@_date: 2017-02-04 23:16:48
Actually, no. The price rose before the halving because of those expectations and was falling since the halving to the current day. That wasn't the outcome people expected.
@_date: 2017-02-05 15:04:40
This. The guy is betting against himself.
@_date: 2017-02-09 01:43:21
They can sell all coins from the smaller chain and buy more on the larger one. That would be a reasonable rule in such a  case. Share holders could get the extra value proportionally.

How is that "nope" or US related? I said that buyer never pays because seller does. If you have a business in Germany and want to accept debit/credit cards, I can guarantee that you will pay for it. In Poland, it's at least 0,3-0,5% of your total turnover (renting the device and fees). By the way, did you try to make a bank transfer to Japan? Is that also free? How long does it take?
@_date: 2017-03-13 10:27:56
No, it wasn't. Nobody was forced to abandon the Gold Standard. Countries still hold a lot of gold – you can buy some too.
@_date: 2017-03-29 19:14:18
Yeah, but it's even harder to believe that nobody explored a plain square root idea.
@_date: 2017-03-29 11:25:24
 I'm not an expert but it seems too obvious to not be explored earlier. Wikipedia mentions only the "integer square root modulo a large prime". I would love to here some comment by a PoW specialist.
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:19:55
Isn't that exactly the Satoshi way? I love the idea.
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:52:47
So true. But "bigblockers" don't understand technology and do not give a *f*. Sad.
@_date: 2017-03-17 10:15:43

@_date: 2017-03-17 16:36:25

I know what the Gold Standard was. We left it as a result of a democratic decision. Any country can go back to it anytime. For some reason, they don't. Conspiracy theories provide some crazy answers but I tend to stick to facts.

You're right. So, for me it looks like the normal European person does not need Bitcoin. As simple as that. I don't believe in an ideological use of Bitcoin. It does make sense when it does make sense. If you don't believe it's worth the transaction fee… then why use it at all? Of course, it may change if the banking system will crash but then you'll be grateful that you can protect your money with just a tiny transaction fee. That said, if the fee can stop you from using Bitcoin you will not use it anyway because people are lazy. You need to see the value first and the value must be worth to pay for it. By the way, it's a very common case that when something is free people do not value it at all.
@_date: 2017-08-24 11:35:41
There are much more problems with EDA:
Inflation is pretty high. The record is 50 blocks per hour so it's more than twice as much Bitcoins mined per hour than before any halving (625&gt;300). That will result in the next halving in half a year.
There is no guarantee that the halving will be effective though. Miners can speed up mining blocks even faster.

For clarification: putting 80-90% into one basket is not really an investing but either gambling or an ideological statement. I understand that watching Bitcoin only rising for 2 years looks like low risk but it's not. It's still very high. Almost all volume right now comes from China and is highly related to the downtrend on Yuan/Dollar pair. Even if you plan to keep those Bitcoins long term, you may be a bit unhappy if later this year the price will be a significantly more attractive. So, do this only if gambling excites you or you really believe that Bitcoin is the thing, it will change the world and you're ready to "die" for it. If it's not your case, I would consider buying small portions regularly over the year. It will significantly mitigate the risk.

You need to put it in a context. In the traditional system, when stocks are going down too fast trading is halted by default to cool market down.

You used a completely messed analogy. BitTorrent is very different on many levels: no global "disk space", no guarantee that you can find your file, no extensive energy usage etc. So it has nothing to do with Bitcoin or even Dropbox. Try to build Dropbox on Ethereum and I can guarantee that to provide the same functionality and efficiency it has to be more expensive. Centralization = wholesale. It must be cheaper by definition. That's why mining is centralized. That's why Amazon wins with smaller retailers. That's why sharing a bigger room is cheaper than renting two smaller rooms. Yes, it's more resilient but never cheaper.

Yeah, the problem is that you also need feedback. "Ok, that was a bad investment – in the next 10 years I will try something new" does not sound like a good way to progress. You can achieve many things in 10 years but incrementally, doing small steps one after another. It's not the same as investing in a company and waiting a decade to see how it will play out.

The best thing that may happen right now is Roger Ver selling all his BTC for BCH. Yes, the price will go down a lot, so people understanding Bitcoin will be able to buy it cheaper and Roger will have no more leverage on the market.

Lessons from posts like that:
1. Never go into debt.
2. People don't understand investing. They just want to earn some extra cash to spend. As soon as ROI is significant enough – they sell everything.
Your capital can work for you for your whole life. Don't spend it faster than it grows. The rule of thumb.

I think it's rather you who think that the world is waiting for instant TXs because you believe so. It's not. There is no demand for that. Bitcoin is useful enough with 10-30min. transactions in ALL cases where it solves a real problem. Bitcoin offers value when you want to buy drugs, send money to China or e.g. store it long-term. There is no problem with buying coffee in Starbucks anonymously and faster than it's currently possible. It works good enough already for 99% of people. No need to fix it.

Before you will get excited, look at the Litecoin block explorer:  Numbers are far from being impressive. It's cheap because nobody uses it. I don't believe Segwit will change it. The same expectations people had about Litecoin halving. Look at the recent Dash, Ethereum, Ripple etc. pumps. All altcoins are the same: they're going up… and down.
EDIT: My actual prediction: shortly after the Segwit activation the price will get a massive drop. Segwit is not a magic wand. Nothing will automatically happen because of that.
@_date: 2017-04-24 21:06:47
Fun fact  SegWit is just a small improvement that is being blocked for stupid reasons so it has become a "magic word". 
Fun fact  For Litecoin, it doesn't solve anything because Litecoin has empty blocks with plenty of room to scale.
@_date: 2017-04-04 22:26:36
Be careful. This will most likely end like an every altcoin pump.

No. It's not. The name mainly refers to the Bitcoin client. Traditionally, we call that a bunch of highly skilled programmers maintaining it but the legal status is none.

Anybody can try to do it but nobody is obligated to participate.

At this point, the activation is almost sure so it's rather already in the price. I would expect a moderate pump and then drop in the next couple of weeks. Nothing will happen because of SW. It's not a magic pill. It's just a small improvement – one of many.

1. Bitcoin as a universal money transfer is a service. This service has value. This is not a perpetual motion because to provide the security of it you need a lot of energy and quite expensive infrastructure.
2. Bitcoin is also a commodity: a database that cannot be censored by anybody. Most importantly, this make the value transfer service possible but has also many other possible use cases. This type of data storage in possible for the first time in the human history.

It's a common mistake, e.g., applying Warren Buffet rules to startup investing. It's an entirely different game. When the whole Apple is worth $8000 (it doesn't matter if OP is correct, it's just an example), it's mostly an investment in people. Buffet invests much later when there is much more information on the market. Not all investments work the same. Bitcoin now is a very different game as well.

There is no such thing. No matter if the price is 20k or 6k, the rule is the same: never buy more than you can afford to lose. If you want to buy more, consider doing that gradually: weekly, monthly, etc. It will give you a piece of mind. Life is to short to spend it watching the price. Cheers.

Basic emotions like greed and fear are always stronger than ideas. People believe in many things but when price moves they act differently. It's just human nature - not a Bitcoin fault.

First of all, if you measure the drop in USD then it indicates that you don't know what you're talking about. Only percentage value matters in that context and it's not the biggest drop for Bitcoin. Also, volatility does not equal manipulation. This is an extremely young market driven by great excitement. It's one of the biggest revolutions in finances of all time – what do you expect? A stable 2% annual growth? Of course, there will be crazy volatility for the next 10 years at least. It will cool down over time.

10x you spend a year in Bitcoins may be enough to be retired and get richer every year as well. Of course, if you convert them to fiat monthly – not at once.

Why? If other parties use Segwit, it may be still more than with blockchain filled with old addresses.

So far Apple is bigger than Bitcoin. There are more iPhone users than Bitcoin users. Everybody knows what iPhone, iPad, Macbook are. You can see their devices in movies and shopping centers… Guys, don't be delusional. We're not there yet. Yes, Bitcoin can cost $10k soon but it would a hope for the bright future – not representation of how big is the market right now.

This exchange is here only for a couple of months… I would never trust them with my money anyway. It would be much more interesting to see that type of event a month ago right after BCH forked and ViaBTC was the main supporter. That could be a gamechanger.

Yes, all those events were revolutions at the time, however, removing trusted third party is simply a more fundamental change. In my humble opinion.

If 6k was really the bottom (still not sure about that), it will massively bust the confidence in the next run. For me, we are already at the "store of value" stage but I know it's not a popular perception.

1. People still don't understand Bitcoin (to be frank – it's difficult!) Not so many of them can evaluate claims so they believe people with charisma.
2. Also, when something or someone is getting popular – haters arrive. It's a natural dynamics – not related to Bitcoin. We like smaller things because we think that it's contrarian "I will not go with the crowd, I'm smarter than that."
@_date: 2018-04-02 11:46:25
Are you ready for the long winter and Bitcoin price way below 2k? If not, sell now – it's not your game.
@_date: 2017-05-15 06:11:27
You exclude anybody but miners from the discussion.
@_date: 2017-05-11 08:29:32
For last two years, people underestimate how much the price will grow. Even crossing 10k is possible because Bitcoin starts looking very attractive for smart money. It can also fork and crash. At this point, it's a wild road. Nobody knows what will happen.

Not really. He wasn't so direct until now.
@_date: 2017-05-17 00:05:11
Yeah, but it's the first time when he finally said: you should have some Bitcoins. A small but significant difference.
@_date: 2017-05-25 07:40:53
Most likely, you're still more than fine in US Dollars. Cheers!
@_date: 2017-05-15 14:38:27
Yes. They have the direct vote but not the whole consensus. If they will act against the rest of the community things will get ugly. That's why they didn't so far.
@_date: 2017-05-16 12:46:32
The market cap is not what you think it is. In some contexts, it makes no sense e.g. it doesn't mean that you can sell all Bitcoins anytime and get $27.7B. In the case of Ripple – it's highly questionable how they estimate coins in circulation etc. This evaluation is kind of a bullshit.
But to be honest – so it's in the case of Bitcoin: e.g. we should probably consider at least 1.5mln of BTC as lost. And it's actually good for Bitcoin because it means it's not pumped so much yet.
That said, Ripple is not even a cryptocurrency so who cares? Apple is worth much more than Bitcoin but it does not compete in the same market
@_date: 2017-05-09 22:18:00
Well said.

I've never paid more than $0.4 or waited more than an hour or two. It's a great service – way cheaper and faster than international transfers.
@_date: 2017-05-09 17:32:44
Have you considered that you probably don't understand the value of the US Dollar as well but simply never thought about it because you didn't have to? To keep USD running you need much more energy than to run Bitcoin. That said:
The value of the service
Transfering money is not free. Having a bank account is not free etc. The cost of it is mostly payed by sellers and in many other bank fees. This is a multi-trillion dollar market. If Bitcoin replaces a tiny piece of that it sucks its value. This is the value of the service.
Bitcoin is also a commodity
Bitcoin blockchain is also the most solid way to put some information online - with a timestamp - and be sure that it will NEVER be edited or removed. The fact that you can create a decentalized money out of it is a side effect of this unique property.
@_date: 2017-05-09 09:30:00
Downvote. I wish you luck but we shouldn't promote that type of gambling here.

He mentioned Bitcoin a couple of times before but it's the first time when he officially recommends it as a solution that will make you able to transact online in case of a banking system not working temporarily.
@_date: 2017-05-23 09:38:07
The layers separation is great. Ethereum will do the same eventually but they picked a rather harder place to start.
@_date: 2017-05-14 20:52:13
Watching that show for a while. SegWit is the solution superior in every possible dimension. No matter if you support bigger blocks or not – you should support SegWit because it's simply an amazing technical update. If you support both – you should start from SegWit because there is a bigger consensus about it. Then you can go back to advocating for bigger blocks. If you block SegWit "because" you support bigger blocks – it doesn't make any sense.
@_date: 2017-07-06 17:55:58
"Burning" is the only fair approach to uncapped ICOs. I hope we will go back to the idea after that bubble will finally pop.

To keep it? Yes. But then you cannot really use it in a convenient way so it really depends on your usecase. Personally, I tend to use Bitcoin from time to time.

Miners must take those social signals into consideration. In the case of a fork, a lot of people and businesses will pick a side with their Bitcoins.

"I will not signal USAF because it has no majority." I don't get this logic. It's a voting mechanism – do you believe that only voting for the candidate winning in polls does make sense?

It looks like I'm talking with a really smart person. Probably smarter then many Core devs supporting UASF etc. I feel honored, sir. That said, the number of nodes signaling BIP148 DOES matter.
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:05:10
It's a more complex enforcing mechanism but it doesn't mean you cannot count those votes. From what I see, the support is sufficient to give it a try and will most likely grow.

False. "Brexit" is a not a real crisis. Actually, there was no Brexit. It's just a tiny bit more likely to happen now but neither surely nor soon. That's why it didn't change too much – because nothing has changed.

It's hilarious that a lot of bitcoiners speak about other cryptos like bankers about Bitcoin. Some of them are not even really experts in anything… just regular hodlers. By the way, as a long term Bitcoin hodler I can only say that Amanda is great and the cryptospace needs more people like her.
@_date: 2019-05-04 16:40:44
That feel.
@_date: 2017-06-20 17:52:39
So we don't know who will signal it yet. There were other agreements before.
@_date: 2016-07-01 12:05:32
They didn't follow the strategy proposed here. That's the point.
@_date: 2017-06-12 12:25:00
If you don't cry when it's going up then don't cry when it's falling down. It's the same reason – more people are selling or buying at this particular moment.

Not perfect like any analogy. BTW, I laughed when they said that "everybody wants dollar". Honestly, that's the worst possible time to keep a lot of money in USD.

"Ethereum is fully centralized" - ok, now we can just say anything and it will keep the same level of accuracy.
@_date: 2016-07-02 10:45:47
On a higher level, the big problem is the belief that inflation is good because it stimulates the economic growth. In fact, it pumps wealth from the little guy to those who own the capital or are closer to the money printing machine. Deflationary currency could be a "wealth redistribution" tool working like "stocks" of the whole economy.

Yeah, they ban Bitcoin posts. My post was deleted once too. On the other hand, it's really hard to blame them. Bitcoin right now is like a wild ride and is for people that don't want to gamble but rather stay financially safe, protect their families, pay loans etc. Those are not necessarily very financially savvy people – just regular Americans looking for help. Recommending Bitcoin to them is not a very wise thing. I made this mistake as well. Will you take responsibility for them if the price will dump again?
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:55:14
Maybe they're a-holes but first of all, they're teenagers. Don't forget that.

But… where is the code? It's not signaling yet. Don't get fooled.
@_date: 2017-06-01 18:29:59
I don't think he has right to blame Coinbase. It was clearly his fault. 2FA everything with Google Authenticator (definitely not SMS) no matter if you're involved in Bitcoin or not. It's just a must. I have a suspicious login attempt to one of my accounts every two months or so.
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:32:14
Interesting, so by comparing their hashpower before and after, we can estimate how big is their "position" on BIP148. So, if BIP148 is growing they need to move some power to the secret chain as well. Not a good position to be in!
Another tiny piece of this game theory puzzle.

@_date: 2016-07-23 15:55:41
When it will be known?
@_date: 2017-07-02 19:17:41
Sure. That said, I believe that people tend to overvalue the technical part and undervalue the game theory part. Everybody waits for somebody else move. BIP148 is not a vote in the same meaning you vote with your hashpower but it has a psychological impact. The belief that only miners have a vote is naive. If this was true – the whole fight would be over a long time ago – we know where they stand.
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:36:52
