I'm not sure what you mean by "a testing page", but Stripe's bitcoin support is still in closed beta.

Your Stripe account needs to be enabled for bitcoin before you can use that.

Company singular.  Tarsnap is the first user of Stripe's bitcoin processing service.

Yes, Stripe is collecting email addresses for its beta-test list and I'm sure once they're happy with how Tarsnap's usage is running (everything seems to be going very smoothly so far) they'll start sending out invitations.

It's a closed beta for merchants.  You can only accept bitcoins via Stripe if they invite you in.  But those merchants can accept bitcoins *from* anyone, and I wanted to warn people here in case they were customers of a merchant in the closed beta.

It's a "closed beta", aka. you ask to be put on the list, and from time to time they let people in.  I'm not sure how much it's "chosen by stripe" and how much it's just based on the order in which people applied.
Tarsnap was the first company in because (a) One of the founders of Stripe is a friend of mine, (b) Stripe is a Tarsnap customer, and (c) I spent about a year saying "you know, I've lots of customers who are telling me that they want to pay with bitcoin...".

It was definitely litecoin which I heard about first (I think they were the first to use scrypt?) but I can't remember exactly when or how.  If the developers had talked to me first I would have told them to use it properly -- they're limiting scrypt to a very small amount of RAM, which is why it has been possible to create useful ASICs for it.  If they had made the amount of RAM scale with difficulty (instead of the hash target) then they probably wouldn't be seeing ASICs yet.
How I feel about it?  Well, the whole "proof of work" thing seems a bit wasteful.  But if they want (for whatever reason) to have lots of CPUs mining instead of a small number of ASICs, using scrypt is a good strategy (even better if they did it properly of course).

I never see the bitcoin.  I don't even have a bitcoin client installed.  I tell the javascript code that I want to receive X US dollars, magic happens, and then I receive X US dollars.  The exchange rate is guaranteed for 10 minutes, so I receive exactly what I asked for and I'm not exposed to exchange rates fluctuations -- and since I'm busy running a business, that's one less thing I need to worry about.
As I [wrote in March when this was launched]( I think bitcoin is a great medium of exchange, but a poor unit of account and a horrible store of value.  Maybe some day the exchange rate will stabilize (and that is certainly improving) but until that happens and as long as I have to pay all my bills with fiat, I need to hold on to fiat, not bitcoins.

Yes, I've talked to some of those developers.  I haven't looked in detail at what they're doing, but at least they've got the right basic idea.

I think there's more than just Tarsnap using Bitcoin with Stripe now, but point taken.  And Stripe has been very responsive in jumping in to track this down.
@_date: 2014-03-27 20:15:08
Yes, I did.
