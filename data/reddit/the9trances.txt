Name even one time that wasn't state-controlled capitalism.  Here, I know all the fake things you're going to bring up, because everyone thinks they're libertarianism when not a single one is.
Somalia?  Had a socialist government for decades, overthrew it, since 2008 has a big centralized government with high tax rates that brutally oppresses its people.
Chile?  Fascism, thinly disguised as capitalism.  The country nationalized the most profitable sectors, including copper.
Reaganomics?  Added more debt and regulations.  Lip-service at best to fiscal conservatism.  Grew the War on Drugs.
Gilded Age?  Tons of regulations and governmental grants to private enterprise.  
Founding of the US?  Briefly, but still built on state-centered imperialism.  
Ireland during the potato famine?  Church and monarchy controlled market that was designed to oppress the Irish peasants.  
Feudalism?  Serfs are prevented from owning land and the product of their labor to fund taxes to a lord who protected them from outsiders.

A bought and sold government isn't the same thing as no government.

If you had seen the notice, would you have claimed them?  It seems to me like a huge sting.

We strictly enforce the use of "np." links which are non-participation. It has circlejerk elements, but we also welcome civil disagreement from all points of view.

Not incompatible with my points at all.  Defensive violence isn't the same thing as aggression.  Killing someone may be done in self-defense, and we all agree that killing is a horrible thing, but in some cases, it may be justified.  
Protection against violence isn't the same thing as stealing money from people because you think they have too much.  It's a different argument entirely.

We agree on this topic.
It _is_ compulsion and non-voluntary funding, but if the alternative is simply to be invaded by "humanitarian" forces, then it's worth it.  
There are examples of private defensive military forces, but that gets quickly into guerrilla warfare as a way of life, and no sane person could claim that a state involuntarily collecting funds is worse than that.

Governmental defensive military spending is not incompatible with minarchist and paleoconservative libertarians.  
And your point about other, hostile countries is one of the reasons I consider myself a minarchist: the reality of foreign aggression doesn't totally go away because we stop playing world police.

Sure, but I've yet to see a reason that wasn't emotional at best and malicious at worst.


Killing someone in self-defense is still killing someone.  Killing someone is immoral, even if it's justified.  We should not get slippery with "well, if it's okay to kill someone who's breaking into your house, why can't we kill them while they're in their car?"  
Taxes are a last resort, and our current society treats them as a magical cure-all that should be applied to everything.


There's still arguments to be made at this point, but I'm not the one making them.  I'm pointing out that they are legitimate arguments, worthy of consideration.


Which, while true, is a temporary state of affairs.  It may last centuries, but it's not inconceivable to see a societal shift away from nationalistic imperialism. 


We've done a pretty awful job at that.  Governments haven't shown much willingness to release power after they've seized it, and there's not much in the way of getting that back as long as the state can control individuals the way it does.

So a powerful, authoritarian state is the same thing as being against a powerful authoritarian state.  
You can talk about China however much the fuck you think you're "qualified," but you don't know the first thing about libertarianism if you think it's "just buy whatever, who gives a shit."

I think there are merits to privatized justice and merits to publicly owned justice.  Personally, I lean towards the superiority of privatized, but it's not that public doesn't have any merit.  I like the private option because the more choice people have, the better, and private organizations (usually) emphasize simplicity.  
Over-engineered, bureaucratic solutions exacerbate brutality, authoritarianism, and civil rights violations, because it makes the well-connected more able to "hide in the bushes."  Simplistic legal systems, like private property as a rule of law, provide less ambiguity in issues like theft, assault, and so forth.

I think a lifelong tax exemption for anyone who volunteers for the defensive military of Minarchia is a fair balance.

Bitcoin, like any currency, has a subjective value. It has no objective value. It doesn't create wealth, it reflects it.
