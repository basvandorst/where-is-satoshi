1. depth
2. support for local bank transfers for local currencies (I trade in PLN)
3. very well secured, double-auth (they care about it since 2011)
4. no lag. (Alternative fee-less PLN market - pln.bitcurex - can't be accessed 90% of he time).
5. I am not a daytrader. 0,6% doesn't matter with a 10% price fluctuation daily...
6. Fee-less markets are usually trading with a premium (it means you can buy there for a price similar to mtgox+fee)

Where I live, you can tow away someone else's car from your property. But making money out of it is not really the point. 
I think of it more as a way of promoting Bitcoin in your local community.   
In many European city centers it is almost impossible to find a parking spot during peak hours. Meanwhile, some civic governments guarantee people living in the city center a personal parking spot assigned to their apartment (even if you don't own a car).
Sharing this space for a symbolic payment in Bitcoins will certainly draw the attention of drivers, pedestrians, and maybe even the local press. :)

Did you know they can actually "reverse" a transaction back to the sending address? YES! They can mark it as "send" and show it on their website like it was only waiting for confirmations. But it is up to them when they actually send your funds. It can be stuck there, "unconfirmed" for days until they decide to send it or reverse it back to the sending address.
Stay away from blockchain.info online wallet. Get yourself multibit or electrum.

I love the Cyprus theory. Significant Bitcoin growth from the Euro suply. But where did the money come from? Aren't all the Cypriotes' bank accounts frozen till tomorow? Just lol. 
Maybe Spain is pushing the price up! Yeah! Because there is a growth in the number of downloads of bitcoin MOBILE apps... and the very same day bitcoin grows. It sure is related!
All this nonsense theories are propagated by Americans who know nothing or very little about European economy. 
In my opinion there is no chance that the current growth is financed by individuals who had nothing to do with bitcoins before. It is all driven by speculation of existing bitcoin investors.

Doesn't matter if people are spending their coins there or not. 
Getting big business involved in bitcoin = getting big lobby in favor of bitcoin.
Imagine Amazon, Google, Apple or any other major IT company accepting bitcoin as a form of payment. There is NO WAY government could make it illegal without a lot of media attention and negative response from the public. 
Right now banning bitcoin as a form of payment would be just another "oh we saw it coming" media news, and will be forgotten a week later.

It's definitely a better idea than investing in ASIC hardware.
But it can still get better. Right now it is very difficult to sell it or buy it quickly. It's easier than with hardware, but still. 
I think ASICMiner should find themself a trusted stock exchange and make it the official trading platform for their stocks. ASICMINER-PT is just additional risk and market depth is ridiculously low.
Buying/selling on forums is too much of an effort.

Ok, so let's say you bought some PT shares. Out of the sudden there are some very bad news for bitcoin future (MtGox security, government, whatever...) and the price begins to fall at a rate of 10% per hour.
**What is your exit strategy?**
From Bitcoin you can just switch to dolar in minutes. PT market depth at BTC TC is so low that even now, in a fairly stable market, a ~~100~~ 204 sell transaction brings the price down to 1BTC (-33%).

The thing is they may never actually publish it to the network. Happened to me twice. The transaction was visible on their website, like it was "on the network" but it really wasn't. It was hanging there with no confirmations for 2 days straight and after that returned to the sending address.

@_date: 2013-05-07 17:08:10
In my opinion it is a very risky assumtion that the dividends and the rise in share price would compensate the risk you take by freezing your funds in shares. If the bitcoin price continues its down rally you will be stuck with shares nobody wants to buy. Even the ASICMINER-PT instruments aren't liquid (right now selling 100 of them will drop the price to 1btc), so with that in mind think about selling real shares over BTCtalk when everybody is panicking and getting rid of bitcoins.
Of course you can be the hardcore long-term bitcoin investor, who is not planning to sell for years and who doesn't believe in any risks associated with potential bitcoin weaknesses, harmful government regulations etc. It's your money! ;)

This is a suply wall ....
Let's go back to the starting point:
* When someone decides to execute a sell order of 400 shares at the market price - for whatever reason - the price drops to 0.01 btc/share
* When someone decides to buy 400 shares he gets most of them at 2,47 btc/share.
Investors apparently assume that the market will only respond positively to the news on ASICMiner and Bitcoin. 
The risk is that demand is not backing up the price at current level. There is nothing to prevent the price from falling when it starts to do so.
@_date: 2013-04-02 21:49:18

Wait till 1BTC = $1000 than 1mBTC = $1

It looks similar although I've been using version 0.4.23 and still got it.
It appeared when I've been running the app for the first time. I was trying to set the fee down to 0,0000001 (i think) and after saving it, it went back to 0,0001. When I was trying to transfer 0,007btc (a total balance) I received a message telling me that I have to cover a 1BTC fee. I modified the fee to 0,0001, saved it, and the problem was gone.
I was trying to follow the same steps again but I couldn't get the 1btc fee message anymore. I didn't try reinstaling it though.

I'll probably get downvoted to oblivion but what the hell...
Buying ASICMiner shares is just stupid. Firs look at the depth of this "market"... A 400 shares brings the value back to micro bitcoins!
Secondly the 'solo mining jump'... All it means is that you get extra 1%(sic!) mining profits.
When this bubble pops?
- Option A - wednesday when people realize the dividend is no longer 0,036 (profits from rigs selling week) but 70% lower around 0,01.
- Option B - whenever the price of bitcoin drops and everyone is trying to cash out
I wouldn't hold this shares a single day longer. The up race is based on the lack of knowledge and will soon be corrected on your expence.

It is believed that 2-5% inflation rate is an optimal level for stable GDP growth.
Hyperinflation is something different. It occures when inflation gets out of control (when cumulative inflation rate exceeds 100% in 3 years).
This quote from Wiki explains it well:
"Hyperinflation effectively wipes out the purchasing power of private and public savings, distorts the economy in favor of the hoarding of real assets, causes the monetary base, whether specie or hard currency, to flee the country, and makes the afflicted area anathema to investment.
Enactment of price controls to prevent discounting the value of paper money relative to gold, silver, hard currency, or commodities, fail to force acceptance of a paper money which lacks intrinsic value. If the entity responsible for printing a currency promotes excessive money printing, with other factors contributing a reinforcing effect, hyperinflation usually continues. Hyperinflation is generally associated with paper money, which can easily be used to increase the money supply: add more zeros to the plates and print, or even stamp old notes with new numbers. Historically, there have been numerous episodes of hyperinflation in various countries followed by a return to "hard money". Older economies would revert to hard currency and barter when the circulating medium became excessively devalued, generally following a "run" on the store of value."
What Bernanke does today:
The entity responsible for printing a currency promotes excessive money printing.
What Bitcoin is:
"hard money"

More like a ASICminer FAP Thread...
**Disclosure: They all own ASICMiner shares.**
So they want you to buy them. Before you get all excited and start fapping with them, remember that a 2% was a yield in an asset that dropped 9% in a week ($132 last wednesday, $121 now).
ASICminer shares owners could easily protect their money if they could only quickly turn bitcoins into fiat. But they can't.
Consider selling 10 bitcoins at $130 
buying it back at $120 (0,65% fee included)
leaves you with 0,693 bitcoin gain compared to 0.152 from dividends.
Now focus for a while longer and picture the price dropping not 9% but 15% or 30%. 
These guys are stuck with their shares in every scenario as they own much more than the BTC TC market capacity is. They are exposed to extreme risk and are desperate to keep it optimistic. 
**tl;dr stay away from this asset unless you like to gamble**

Besides, what's the difference? If price falls, it falls. Doesn't matter if this is a single person executing 120k btc order or 120k people executing 1 btc orders. IT-IS-DOWN!
The last person to get out of investment losses! Free market, biatch.

Sorry, but 30% drop in 2 weeks isn't just a "slight drop". 
If you were really looking at larger trends you'd realised that the uptrend was broken around 25 May on a D1 chart (and thats pretty significant information). Even if you decided to stay positive you had a confirmation of trend reversing a week later, 2 June. Cutting your loss then, even at $115 low, could save you a lot of money.
*So much of the change in price is because of dumb people doing dumb things.*
And yet they remained with more money in their pockets. Idiots.

You can use every address to receive coins (cold storage, even paper wallet) and you can use cold storage to send coins, it doesn't have to be Trezor. What Trezor does is making it simpler. Sending money from cold storage is done by signing the transaction on the offline computer and sending it to the network on the online computer. 
Trezor serves as a full cold storage setup, offline transaction generator and it can transmit this transaction to an online computer by connecting to it with an usb port (you don't have to use the usb stick to do this anymore).
But this coin is way cooler than Trezor ;)

In my opinion there is only one factor that can turn the existing economy upside down and make bitcoin-like currency a significant component of the financial system:
The occurrence of high inflation or hyperinflation in one of the world's major economies. Bitcoin's supply is limited, it is not linked to the financial system as we know it today, therefore it would be an obvious choice for safekeeping savings in difficult times.
Hyperinflation is not a rare phenomenon. Just because the U.S. has not experienced it for a long time, does not mean that the next few years does not bear the risk of its occurrence.
Today Bernanke dumps billions of dollars without coverage. What will be the long-term effects of such a policy - it is difficult to predict. One thing is certain: it will not destroy Bitcoin.

@ BTC Guild
Why would BTC Guild want to destabilise bitcoin? That'd be stupid.
@ MtGox
Can other exchanges offer equaly safe service as MtGox does? I mean: double authentication, DDOS protection (they DO protect themselves from most attackers), SLL from a respected company etc.
 
**What can realy make me switch to another exchange:**
* headquarters in European Union
* clear legal situation
* regulation of tax on behalf of the user (even today it is not clear whether the income from trading btc should be subjected to the capital income tax or something else)
First company that gets itself regulated within EU borders gets all my trades.

Yeah 1%... this, and the 20% drop that can happen everyday makes this "investment" pretty much RETARDED. You have to be VERY enthusiastic about bitcoin mining or own bitcoins in quantities you can't easily sell (100k+). 
@_date: 2013-05-03 11:44:51
Well a lot of buzz has been build upon the Coinlab-MtGox cooperation which was included in price at the beggining of the up-rally. Now when it appears that it is not happening the price is getting back to the old normal. 
Information is spreading slowly (its 7:45 AM in US, so not everyone is up yet and aware of what's going on) so I think we didn't hit today's bottom just yet.
In my opinion selling at $85 is still selling with premium. We're gonna hit $50 by the end of the weekend.
Disclaimer: I do not own any bitcoins and I am not planning to get back into the market in near future. I believe we're about to experience a several months long stagnation at $30-$50.

Dude.... It always makes sense to cut your loses. Long term or short term strategy.
Or maybe it's like an evolution and natural selection where capital sticks to people who manage it well. Than you should expect your investment-Darwin award anytime soon.
Sorry but I don't think that's the way to go. Unless you have a $100 investment.

Cyprus is a small island, which was a tax haven and fell into trouble as a result of close conection of its banks with Greek economy. If we would like to place the bank within the European Union, which could represent the interests of all European Bitcoin users, our aim should rather be any of the major European economies like Germany or France (they're both bitcoin-friendly).
In the German capital, Berlin, is now one of the largest Bitcoin community in the world. I think Bitcoin is considered legitimate financial instrument in Germany, which makes it a very promising target (I'm not 100% sure about that, can any German confirm that?).
In France there is a company which teamed up with French central bank and provides a guarantee for deposits as a normal banks do (I dont know any details on this one either).
Finally, I would like to point out that:
* Europe is not equal to **European Union**
* Only countries within the European Union are linked economically
* Getting a banking license in one EU country enables bank to open branches in other countries within EU without having to apply for a new license. The bank is under the supervision of the country in which the headquarters are.
* Not every country within the European Union use Euro (there are British Pounds GBP, Polish Zloty PLN etc.) so we're not all dependent on Euro Zone where Grece and Cyprus are. 
* **Iceland**, Norway, Switzerland, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Croatia - these countries are in Europe, but are not part of the European Union. We don't need a bank there.

I'm not sure if this is what you mean, but...
Bitcoin trading volume (or any other asset's) rises when there is a significant, trend-changing move of the price. 
So the scenario is:
1. Significant price change
2. Raise of trading volume
Not the other way around. 
The significant price change may be caused by some fundamentals (like MtGox's problems with law or security) or just by a huge sell out (like a single $2m transaction today). 
So basically when it gets kicked out of a trend and it starts falling everybody knows that it is more likely to continue its down rally, and they sell. This is called a self-fulfilling prophecy.

DUUUDE!! This idea is AWESOME!!!! Imagine someone living in the city center providing a private parking space with a sign saying: 
**"BITCOIN USERS ONLY, 0.005 btc/hour, PAY TO: [QR CODE]"**
This is the best way to make your local community familiar with Bitcoin that I ever heard of!!  
**Requesting: Bitcoin parking sign design with additional space for personalized QR Code!** :)

With enought political preasure they might be able to push exchanges to underground (banks do listen to governments and might stop doing business with exchanges when their asked to do so) and that way, make bitcoins useless (with no usd/btc exchanges price and trading volume is back to day 1).
Unless we do something first to lobby and regulate it our way (yes, i believe facebook twins are right).
@_date: 2013-05-21 16:08:31
I never said it will drop to 0.01 and stay there. There is a dividend which will always keep the price on a reasonable level from the bottom. I'm just saying that 2,50 has nothing to do with its current value. 
@_date: 2013-06-04 21:35:37
I'm not convinced.








Regulation does not mean govermental control over bitcoin. Goverment will never be able to take control over it as it is physically impossible. 
Regulation means **protecting bitcoin** from becoming number 1 government enemy. We have to normalize the rules and do it **our way** before government steps in with its' thoughtless and irresponsible prohibitions.
You should think of it as more like a race to sustaining this precedent and inevitable technology as widely accepted as possible. We race against bank lobby, supporters of quantitative easing and Keynesian policies. I think it's high time to start lobbying in our direction before it is too late.

With various currencies around the world, a country accepting a deflationary currency puts itself in a position where its markets are getting less and less competitive internationally as its products are getting relatively more expensive to export. (You can't lower salaries so you can't lower the price.) 
But what if....
There was only ONE currency for entire world. Couldn't it become deflationary without any negative consequences towards the exports?
