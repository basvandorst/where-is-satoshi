It effects you none which financial intermediary they choose to use if any at all. Overstock was the first major company to start accepting bitcoin. I think they know what they are doing:

A vpn is what caused one of the most recent market busts. The General opsec guideline is NOT to use a vpn when connecting to dark net markers.

I see what you mean now.

Sounds like you actually do need to convince. You’re trying really hard to make a point and utterly failing.

3k to 14k isn’t a run up?

Isn’t the first reply to the public release of bitcoin from Hal about the potential price bitcoin can achieve as it takes over use as the worlds monetary system?

You’re mistaking me for someone who cares. The only argument that I’ve made is that bitcoin is the most widely used crypto which is correct. You seem way too emotionally invested in the other points you are trying to make.
@_date: 2018-06-30 04:35:31
Are you joking? Bitcoin is by and large the most widely used and accepted cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2018-06-30 14:09:35
Huh, I was replying to a comment about bitcoin being the most widely used and accepted cryptocurrency. Is usd a cryptocurrency or are you just an idiot with no reading comprehension?

There is no reason to believe the stock market wouldn't recover, nothing indicates that. You could make the exact same argument for Bitcoin as there is no foundation for the argument. Ultimately, it's your money to do what you want with, and I think Bitcoin will be a more valuable investment long term as well. That doesn't mean that it is smart to gamble on that chance with 100% of your retirement portfolio.

What leads you to believe your 401k will be worthless? It isn't social security...
There isn't really anything to indicate that a 401k would be anywhere near worthless 30-40 years from now.

Sure but are you going to claim that a stock has equal chance of going up or going to zero?

I've never sent it through a centralized processor when I'm paying someone with bitcoin. I only use centralized processors to trade, and I imagine that's what most people use it for. Of course the majority of the volume is going to be through an exchange when a majority of people are using crypto as a trading tool. That doesn't make its original function any less valid, it just means that people have found another use for it as well.
@_date: 2018-04-01 21:40:02
Just because people use it for other purposes does not mean that what I said is not a use of bitcoin.

You are the most annoying kind of person. I mean why are you spending all this time arguing lame semantics and irrelevant shit with people about something you clearly aren't interested in? It makes no sense. Did I say anything about the government? We are talking about centralization. I am using the tools available to me to take centralized currency (USD) and turn it into decentralized currency (Bitcoin). What I don't like is centralized currencies, so saying that I have to use a centralized currency to buy bitcoin isn't an argument as it literally trading away that currency for a decentralized one. And no, the transactions are not dependant on the website. I found the sellers on that website, we are now connected offline and I can buy/sell bitcoin whenever I'd like.

Saying something as a certainty and acting on it doesn't sound like gambling to me. Sounds like a sure thing! So go ahead and make your millions shorting bitcoin. Too bad you don't have any money to put up in the first place. Maybe if you had bought some bitcoin the first time you heard about it instead of being a massive cunt :) have a lovely day you broke ass troll.
And you posted on buttcoin 3 years ago...LOL how mad you must be to see yourself be proven wrong month after month year after 3 for 3 years straight. Imagine telling someone to sell an appreciating asset for 3 years in a row and being row everytime and missing out on 1000x profits while accomplishing nothing in life in the meantime LOOOOOOOOOOL the absolute state of your life hahahahaha.

I purchase bitcoin off people I find on localbitcoins (ooh centralized cause it connects people lol...) for cash, and i've sold all my bitcoin for cash the same way. I don't care if majority of people are willing to use centralization. I, and many others that have been invested in bitcoin for years, have done so off the principle of decentralized, peer 2 peer payments.
