The transaction fees have recently dropped to below $2 dollars per transaction.

Fixed! It was the locked outputs after all. All of the transactions receiving from the faucet were locked. I did try unlocking them before but I made a mistake, I copied your unlock command directly and changed the "txid" parameter but not the "vout" parameter, which was different for me. They are all unlocked now and I'm no longer getting WAIT_FOR_ACCEPT_CHANNEL under status. 
Thanks again for your help and all that you're doing for the community!

Where do you find out about unlisted coins?

Hey, thanks for the guide! This is super helpful. I've nearly finished setting up my own node on the Raspberry Pi 3 but whenever I try to open a channel, its state gets stuck at "WAIT_FOR_ACCEPT_CHANNEL"
Anything I can do?

I'm not even seeing any transactions in the wallet except for the ones transferring from the faucet or to the segwit address. I've been unlocking the wallet for an hour at a time but I could try a longer period.

My wallet is unlocked and I’ve grepped the entire log file for that message but it turns up nothing...

Oh, yep! I let it go for a while and this showed up: "wallet returned error: fr.acinq.eclair.blockchain.bitcoind.rpc.JsonRPCError: Insufficient funds (code: -4)"
Here's the pastebin for the full grepped log:

Yes, the channels are dropped after a while. Here's the link to the pastebin with the log:  
Thanks a lot for your help, I appreciate it.
