As someone who bought $4 of btc when the price was $19000, my immutable expertise gives me authority to insist on a $5000000 price by mid next week.

Would I be covering my ass by putting bread wallet on a separate smart phone with no data connection and only occasional/brief internet connection? Or, are there other aspects to a hot wallet that put me at risk?

Are you in the US? How will you handle taxes? What debit card do you have?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:08:26
When is this being voted on?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:58:56
When you say it's always connected, is that on the user end? What if I have it on a device that is only connected to the internet when I am doing something with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:03:58
Aaaahhh, good point. Thank you for answering my questions.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:55:02
Thanks for all of that. That's cool stuff. But I was asking how you deal with taxes because everytime you but a coffee or anything with Bitcoin, that is a realization event and subject to capital gains.
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:33:12
I don't disagree with that at all.

Do crossbows need to be registered in his area?

Thanks. I'll check them out.
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:27:17
Wtf are you even talking about? I never said anything about making predictions. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 00:24:34
You scoundrel.
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:07:07
I think taxes might be a bit risky to not seek professional counsel for.

...You think asteroids don't exist?

Lol. He's just saying that demand/supply increased.

No. It's beautiful. Leave it just like that.
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:06:43
Thanks for this info. I'm ignorant. What does the 12.5624 represent? And why isn't $180mil feasible.
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:47:43
I hope you don't mind me asking you questions to inform myself. How is the price of a Bitcoin related to mining fees?
@_date: 2016-07-03 17:09:15
I would be if I had money. I have a few that I bought a couple years ago, but I just graduated and am styling waiting on that first job. I hope to be able to buy half a coin every month.
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:13:06
Nice. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-13 16:04:20
Is that supposed to be better?
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:44:24
What, exactly, is wrong with this? So maybe I can't afford an entire btc at the current price, but I want to own an entire btc. I decide, instead of buying ltc, to research MACD charts and use their data to turn 0.1 btc into one full coin. 
I mean, holy shit! I got into bitcoin because it's innovative and I wanted to make some money. Fuck me, right?
@_date: 2013-11-21 06:32:44
That video is awesome. Thanks so much!
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:59:50
I agree. There is no excuse for sensationalism.
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:17:26
You silly man. You must think things never change.
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:31:57
I want to know who downvoted this comment, and why.
@_date: 2013-12-17 08:22:59
This looks promising...
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:29:13
I don't even know what 2 factor is!
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:02:51
Thanks for the math lesson. People are panic selling all the time, and you act like it's some mystery where the extra 0.9 btc is going to come from. The lack of experience and resources only makes me less efficient, not ineffective.
@_date: 2013-12-12 04:20:57
How easy/hard is it to get your money out of VOS if you sell your coin?
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:24:40
/right here on the front page of this subreddit.
@_date: 2013-12-25 07:55:41
I'm also curious as to what the fee is for wiring amounts in excess of $1000 out of VOS and how long that takes.
@_date: 2013-11-25 05:59:05
OMG! My half a BTC is going to make me a multimillionaire!
@_date: 2013-12-12 04:42:30
I'll check it out. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:12:50
Thanks, bro! This is the article.
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:39:07
I've been hearing a lot of stories lately about people trying to withdraw btc out of BTCe and never seeing anything show up... their bitcoins just disappear. So, I decided transfer my coins to an account inside BTCe. I thought that might be safest until BTCe gets their shit together and bitcoins stop disappearing.
Its not like all of my bitcoins are on BTCe.
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:24:02
Oh. Yeah, I have that. I just wasn't simply calling it 2 factor. Thanks though.

I'm testing the waters with a small reserve and being pretty cautious. If I lose out, it really won't be a big deal. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:26:13
OH MY GOD
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:25:56
Because I wanted to get the coins off of my account.
