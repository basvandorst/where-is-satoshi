What the heck are you talking about 
"Since 1971, U.S. citizens have been able to utilize Federal Reserve Notes as the only form of money that for the first time had no currency with any gold or silver backing. This is where you get the saying that U.S. dollars are backed by the “full faith and credit” of the U.S. Government"
It's money out of thin air

Hey man ..  when it goes up to 50k and drops to 25k john and becky will come back

Then crypto is backed by it's people.. just all over the world rather than one country
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:57:09
Comes out of thin air ... sounds like USD to me.. but yes I agree that most alt coins will fail.. and I want them too . There are way too many of them , the quality alt coins with quality projects behind them  hopefully and most likely will win in the long run ... but i definitely want all the shit coins out so that more money could be in quality projects

Download coinbase on your phone.. its the easiest platform to buy bitcoin [Watch this video to learn about paper wallets to keep your funds safe]( and [watch this one for when ever you want to withdraw your funds]( Now for coinbase you'll need to verify your ID so have an ID/passport ready for verification (You'll have to take pictures on them) and you're set.. but please watch these videos carefully so you know what you're doing.. I know it sucks but we all had to do it.. you'll understand how things work in no time

Yea you can send the 100 to a new wallet if you're not exposing your private key.. But whenever you do export your private key take out the whole balance and put it in a new wallet

 Move your mouse around until 100% and it will generate a wallet. DO IT OFFLINE.. and then send it to that .. keep your private key private.. 
Edit:Once you go on the site once you can go on it without any internet

@_date: 2017-12-07 10:45:26
You can hold bitcoin in it but its always recommended to put it in a offline wallet , so paper wallet (Free) or hardware wallet (aounrd 80 bucks) .To put money in that paper wallet you simply press on "Your accounts"  under where you see your account value on the "prices" tab , select BTC wallet , click the arrow on the top right select how much you want to send in dollars , then on the send page click the barcode sign , point it at your public key barcode on your paper wallet and you're set! Now to check your balance on your paper wallet type out your public address on [this site]( and press enter.
Edit: and yes Gdax is with coinbase but its a little more complex BUT has lower fees
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:01:47
Now ... prices are low .. but in investing don't get caught up in trying to time the market.. that puts too much stress on you.. invest weekly or bi weekly .. we call it dollar cost averaging please do your research on cost averaging. Now is there a chance that you invest now and it goes even lower? Yes .. that doesn't matter though the price will go up eventually.. there is no such thing as a "proper time" to buy because what is considered "high" today will be low in the future... just dollar cost average and you'll be fine in the LONG RUN.. Don't treat bitcoin like a get rich quick scheme .. cause it isn't. Now when you dollar cost average you could maybe invest more than usual in down markets. Bitcoin isn't stable and won't be for a long time and thats a good because you can buy low very often... 
For better understanding look at the bitcoin price chart to see .. You'll see times where it went VERY low.. these are the times where weak investors pull out their money.. but then in the chart you'll see ALL TIME HIGHS after those "crashes" .. so if those weak investors Invested more during low's rather than pulling out they'd make A LOT more money... So when you invest don't do it with a weak hand .. stay disciplined and don't freak out over "crashes"

HE SAID HIMSELF he doesn't understand crypto THATS WHY it's irrelevant .. are you gonna take advice for someone about anything if they admit they don't know anything about the subject ? I'll listen to buffet about investing in stocks etc... but why in the world would I care about his opinion on something he doesn't even understand ? He has a HORRIBLE track record with technology stocks cause he doesn't understand technology ..... yea he's a smart guy.. but NOT in this space , he's pretty much an idiot with anything that has to do with tech

Second off if you actually knew what the fuck you were talking about you would know how big bitcoin is going to be in this economy ... are you deaf to big banks opening up crypto for investors ? Banks starting to open up platforms , blind to some projects that will give access to those without bank accounts around the world? Fucking NEO working with government in China ..

@_date: 2018-05-18 18:56:57
I'll bow to him for traditional investments... but HE SAID himself he doesn't even understand crypto ... why the hell am i gonna care about his opinion ?

[Heres a video that explains paper wallets well](
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:09:57
I personally buy from coinbase mobile app..  you just have to verify what ever bank account or credit card you're using. If you're using credit card you can verify it in less than 5 minutes. They will deposit small amounts in your account and you just have to go see how much was deposited and confirm it on the app. Buying from there on is VERY straight forward.. that app is very noob friendly. Other places like Gdax have lower fee's but won't be as noob friendly. 
Now when you buy on coinbase your money is going to be in the coinbase exchange , many people recommend storing your bitcoins in cold/paper wallets (They are the same thing) it just means a place where your money is offline meaning that it's safe from any potential attacks online. I recommend you watch [this video]( It thought me everything I need to know about paper wallets (again its just a wallet that you print and store your bitcoin in) DO NOT PRINT IN A PUBLIC PLACE
And then this [video]( that teaches you how to take your money out of paper wallets...  Now you will naturally learn as you go from there.. this is just what has worked for me. There are many other ways to do everything.. But I recommend you watch as much beginner videos as possible.. I know it  sucks to do cause you most likely wanna get in the game but we all had to do it.. and I am still learning everyday
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:25:39
[Heres a video on paper wallets]( It's pretty simple.. you'll wanna ultimately keep your money in cold storages (Just a word for offline places so you can
t get hacked somehow) 
[This video is how to withdraw funds from your paper wallet]( ... but other than that you'll wanna watch a lot of bitcoin 101 videos.. just immerse your self into bitcoin and you'll understand it pretty quickly. I only started this month also , I watch bitcoin videos daily.. do the same and you'll have enough knowledge in no time 
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:36:00
Thank you !

@_date: 2017-11-13 17:51:52
Not sure... if you want convenience just use coinbase mobile app.. it's instant buy... and then you can transfer your funds to quad pretty quickly.. I'm Canadian so I also use quad... only thing is theres a 6-7 dollar transfer fee.. which sucks
@_date: 2017-11-10 04:36:43
I currently use paper wallets.. all you have to do is create a new wallet every time you import your private key. It's not that much of a hassle

Like I said... Education is fine... But if I don't need it .. I don't need it.. I can travel the world , go to conferences and meet great people too. What value are you talking about ? You just go to school for the experience ? Well you should know that's a luxury .. most people go to school cause they want a job after
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:07:18
It’s an example
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:14:42

Thanks! I had No idea
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:07:15
I understand ... but man understand that most people aren't in your position ... I know a lot of people that go to school purely because they want to have a career and end up not being able to find a job and stuck in debt... most of them are doing something totally different than what they studied for.. you have to look at it from that perspective too.... you pay 10k + to hopefully get a job just for all of it to go to waste... if you go to top uni to feel fulfilled ... fine .. but again.. that is a luxury
@_date: 2017-11-09 11:23:19
How so ? If your grand ma kept 20 bucks under her bed and that 20 bucks is worth 30 a year later .... she would still have 30. Correct me if I’m wrong but wallet keep track of how many units you have ... not the amount of money you have

@_date: 2017-11-29 01:39:10
Well.. yea... the only reason people get educated is to make money. They want to get a degree that will hopefully get them a job that pays a lot , thats the whole point. Being "Uneducated" doesn't mean anything.. I know 6 figure earners personally that are "Uneducated"

@_date: 2018-07-07 16:00:09
Depends how you day trade , people that day trade lose their asses cause they go for huge gains , if you just aim for 1% gains every trade its pretty easy and a lot less stressful. You Can't just tell people not to day trade.. some will some won't ... I do , and I am to get small gains every trade and that works 95% of the time from experience so far.

tell your  friend that you can't time markets and teach him about dollar cost averaging before he makes a stupid mistake 
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:58:40
This ^ .. Dollar cost averaging is better that way you're invest in the highs and lows if you invest 10k now and in a months it goes down to 6000 for example you can invest another 10k when it's 6000 and do it every month but if you just throw 100k and it goes down to 6000 you can't take advantage of anything and you're stuck waiting for it to eventually go higher than when you threw all your money in.
Edit: used 6000 as an example cause in CAD it's over 7000

Just like the markets... you can't time it ... best you can do which is what I'm gonna do is invest monthly or bi weekly.. Dollar cost averaging is the best thing to do imo.. that way you're investing in high's and low's .. and today's highs will be considered low in the future (Hopefully)
