We are definitely working on supporting Monero!
There are some challenges to integrate Monero in the wallet when it comes to displaying the user's balance. Currently this means we need to go through the entire blockchain to collect the balance and this takes a long time. We are still looking into how to solve this problem.

This is used to store preferences (in this case, your favourite assets dashboard).
If your browser is online in the wallet for, let's say 5 minutes, by a proof of work system the browser has added to the network and your preferences are stored (in a decentralised networks) for a week or longer. 
If you haven't logged in for, e.g. a year, and you have used your wallet for a very, very short time (4 minutes), your preferences may not be saved.
Your assets will of course never be deleted. This system is only used for a minor functionality (adding assets to the dashboard). Because we value privacy, we chose to build this on a decentralised system.
The numbers are a bit ballpark figures, but I hope this explains it a bit.
