I think its a good idea, but instead of the percentage of the recovery I think its better if it is percentage of the company share and its benefit

actually this guy said something similar last time before we hear the news that they found 200k bitcoin.. he said good news coming from mt.gox.. 
I hope his source is legit this time as well
here is his previous tweet:

I think its a good idea to create goxcoin. I think it would be much better if they can associate the goxcoin as a token of share of the new exchange. so for example if its 100k share of the company distributed to users, 100k goxcoin be generated so each coin represent 1 share. in that case, those coins have value and worth trading.

the thief cannot launder large amount of coins by changing it to another alt. Because they don't have that much market cap and the price spikes down easily... and it gets suspicious.. if he want to do it in this way, he should be very patient and do it over the years.

i think this is beneficial to bitcoin as it is to dogecoin. 
I first came to this whole crypto by buying some doge, and later that i got more familiar with the system, i came to bitcoin.. 
I guess this would be nice for both... 
now I hold some dogecoin but mainly bitcoin

Goxcoin can be an option.. with this rate of selling looks like he just want to get rid of his coins.. and it seems just one person is dumping systematically..

Count me in as well

exactly, its a good way to begin with

Maybe this is 200k mentioned in crises strategy draft. He was saying that we need 200k bitcoins in order to reconstrcut mt.gox. I think he knew he has access to this much coin in first place. My guess is that we will soon see new mt.gox site with limited withdraw for bitcoin and cash

What do you get when you put 50 lawyers in a room with 50 lesbians? 
One hundred people who don't do dick.

The amount of FUD spread over these is unbelievable. As you said there is no more selling.
