this is dumb and im saying this as a Venezuelan, people will only exchange bitcoin for other stable currency like the euro or dolar, nobody will exchange a bitcoin for bsf, the only way someone would sell their bitcoin to bsf is to the black market rate, defeats the propouse since i rather have dolars that everybody would accept.
i rather buy keys from local dota traders and sell them for usd, then having bitcoin and see them crash.

how would you like to be restricted from spending your money while traveling?
Venezuelans can only spend 700$(this rate depends in what place you are going) a year if there going to travel to miami and 300$ if there buying from amazon.
worst part is that preparing to travel is a burocratic hell.

im against control exchange, but we dont need to import food or cloth, this could be easily made in our country, this will give us jobs and more oportunitys for our people.
youre doing it wrong, right know the only thing that bitcoin could do to our economy is giving the people more tools to destroy our already fucked economy by using bitcoin as a ''raspacupos'' tool.

Why would someone have a large sum of money from another country in their coach to begin with?
Almost everything is done by bank transfers.

nope, thats the point of exchange control, but!
if you have a account in the exterior they cant do anything about it. nobody will make transactions with you if you cant make a bankwire since its not to easy to get scammed.

sometimes you have to bite the bullet and make leaps of faith, but always start small and with small quantitys, i dont buy bitcoins because i feel like a chimp trying to use the wallet and i dont have idea what to do with bitcoins since nobody accept them in my country, also btc are more expensive in my local currency, im curious about e-currency, just dnt have the money or knowledge for bitcoins for now.
but i do buy dota treasure keys from traders, at first i exchanged money for dota keys and dota keys to games, then games to local currency, then a huge inflation was incoming, bought lots of keys from retiring traders and cashed out in paypal money, made a huge profit buying keys in my local currency and with the devaluation of my currency my money is in usd, then selling the keys in paypal money, so far i learned to be confortable with the people you deal and never get greedy, got scammed once, but recovered the money.
