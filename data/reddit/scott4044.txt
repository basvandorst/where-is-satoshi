The bitcoin you send goes to the payment processor (Bitpay , Coinbase etc) who then pays the merchant in USD. 
Customer&lt;--.17 BTC --&gt; BITPAY&lt;---100USD---&gt;Merchant
(edit: unless the merchant accepts BTC directly. which isnt many, considering businesses do not want the volatility risk of BTC)

**Its so frustrating**
"Specifically, Big Blue is interested in **the blockchain -- the mechanism Bitcoin uses to publicly record transactions.** Today's businesses each have their own records, slowing transactions and triggering problems figuring out who's right when there are disagreements. But the blockchain approach is more cooperative by providing a consistent record that members of a network can see.
**"The blockchain is about distributed trust,"** said Arvind Krishna, a senior vice president at IBM Research's Almaden lab, speaking Thursday at a 30th anniversary event."
**And then two paragraphs later**
"IBM likes blockchain but isn't touching the Bitcoin project itself where the technology first arrived. Bitcoin has been plagued with multiple thefts, yo-yoing value, governance problems and an unsavory connection to the Silk Road drug marketplace.
IBM is steering clear of Bitcoin for technology reasons: Krishna doesn't believe in one vast blockchain with anonymous transactions, but instead sees blockchain as useful for smaller networks of companies doing business together.
**"I think there will be thousands of blockchains,"** he said, not one, and not millions. On each, the identity of each party is clear, and encryption keeps transaction details private except to those who have permission to see details.

yes. the marketcap for bitcoin is currently 3 billion dollars. about 250 per bitcoin. the market for worldwide remittances is around 600billion. At that marketcap, one bitcoin would be worth $40,000. The remittance market is low-hanging fruit for bitcoin to swallow up (due to bitcoin's frictionless/low-cost nature). All of the world's wealth combined is worth many trillions of dollars. If you believe, in the future, that bitcoin will be used universally in all financial transactions, $250 a bitcoin should have you salivating.

Former Merrill Lynch executive Bob Wigley has joined the growing ranks of financiers hailing the cost-cutting potential of bitcoin and the technology underpinning the controversial currency.
The group’s former head for Europe, the Middle East and Africa called bitcoin a potential “leading global payments system” and said he had invested in a UK-based bitcoin payments start-up.
“It has cost advantages. It’s another way of outsourcing in a very cost efficient manner part of the costs of processing transactions. Payment systems are quite costly things to operate,” he said, arguing that bitcoin would challenge incumbent financial services providers “anywhere where you have small transaction values and high transaction costs”.
Mr Wigley joins Blythe Masters, the former JPMorgan executive who helped develop credit default swaps, Duncan Niederauer, a former chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange and Peter Randall, the founder of Chi-X Europe, as a host of high-profile executives explore ways to apply the technology to financial services.
Bitcoin was invented in late 2008 as a way of making payments without the need for a centralised third-party to track and approve transfers. Transactions are processed by a network of computers, which are rewarded with transaction fees and a subsidy of newly minted currency that will eventually cease.
The technology underpinning the currency is called blockchain and is a way of managing databases in multiple locations in the absence of a single, centralised authority.
In depth
As interest in bitcoin increases, US officials are looking into how to regulate, rather than shut down, the virtual currency. Mr Wigley, who previously oversaw the restructuring of the debt-laden Yellow Pages publisher Yell, said he invested this year an undisclosed amount in Blockchain, a UK-based company that derives its name from the underlying technology, and was now advising the group.
Blockchain claims to be the leading supplier of consumer bitcoin “wallets” — software used for receiving and making payments with the currency. Last year, the company raised $30m in funding from investors including Sir Richard Branson, Lightspeed Ventures and Wicklow Capital, which at the time was the largest single funding round by a bitcoin business.
While bitcoin’s early backers hailed the invention as a means of freeing money from the control of governments and banks, the likes of Blythe Masters and her start-up Digital Asset Holdings have focused on using blockchain, the technology, as a way of modernising backroom banking systems.
Duncan Niederauer, the former NYSE chief executive, has backed Symbiont, which is developing a platform for digital securities trading. At a launch event last month, Symbiont chief executive Mark Smith said the platform was developed to work with generic blockchains to make it more appealing to banks wary of interacting directly with the controversial currency.
Nasdaq is also using the technology and announced a partnership with US start-up Chain for a private share-trading platform earlier this year.
Mr Wigley said it was too early to write off the “nascent” bitcoin currency and said he believed both bitcoin and blockchain applications would develop alongside each other.
“I’m not the only one. Many of the UK’s biggest banks are taking the view that bitcoin and blockchain could be a fundamental part of the future of the way transactions are done,” he said, referring to exploratory initiatives by the likes of Barclays.
Despite his bullishness about bitcoin and blockchain, Mr Wigley said he did not have any money invested directly in the currency. “I don’t think you could say that investing in bitcoins specifically is a sound investment,” he said, noting volatility in the currency’s value.

good question. beats me. maybe investing in startups looks a lot 'safer' than investing in a digital currency. No one wants to be the first to do new things, at the risk of looking foolish. or maybe these banks have been accumulating coins for the past year at these cheap prices over the counter. i hope not

i enjoyed hearing about the tech bubble comparison too but what peter doesnt understand  is that he isnt in the minority group anymore. he saw the housing bubble in 08 because he looked at the facts while everyone else in america accepted what the media/government was reporting. Yes, this subreddit can get circle jerky but we get that way because we see the potential of bitcoin. we see the facts. 80% of the world probably doesnt know what a bitcoin. of the 20% that do, 90% percent of them probably think they are used to buy drugs online. We are what peter was in 07. we're shouting the facts while everyone else doesnt want us at their dinner parties.
