You're just parroting bullshit.

Hasn't there always been at least a 10% arbitrage between mtgox and bitstamp? I've thought about exploiting this numerous times but I've always figured there must be some reason for this not to work.
Fiat -&gt; MtGox -&gt; Buy BTC -&gt; Send to bitstamp -&gt; Sell for $ -&gt; Withdraw -&gt; Mtgox etc..

"Sees" in this case means an automatic script confirms the transaction IDs don't match and re-credits the coins. Super-poorly implemented by SR but I don't suspect the admins of anything.

Let's just forget about the guys he attempted to have killed.. He'd be in jail for life even without all the drug stuff.

What's actually happening is the roller coaster falling down.

No dancing.
EDIT : Also OP has hardly shorted any of these other markets so his glee is pointless.

This has nothing to do with Bitcoin, they just want the blockchain technology.

Because train tickets and expensive gifts or something I don't know.

Ok, now how do you buy gas with BTC without aiding and abetting credit card fraud?
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:44:25
Just buy your drugs with the btc and buy the same amount of btc with fiat money. Movement is good.

Stuff like this makes me think of the youtube video of a command line window displaying the live bitcoin buy/sell order ticker from the last crash. One entry is a buy order for over 260000 coins, when the price was a one cent.
EDIT : And here it is :

Even if it drops down to a few bucks I'm holding on to what I got and I will probably buy a whole lot more.
@_date: 2013-04-05 01:44:29
Only 7999 tickets to go! However my guess is that the reserve number will decrease faster from the increase in the value of bitcoins than people buying tickets.

That was surprisingly good press, from the small comment snippets I read before I went out this morning I expected it to be horrible.

Talk about post-fap regret if the bitcoin price explodes..

Putting in a one trade per ten seconds limit would not affect the regular user in the slightest.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:09:50
I'm trying as hard as I can to tell everyone I know about bitcoin without becoming "that guy who only talks about bitcoin".
@_date: 2013-04-28 14:38:10
If I didn't know about Bitcoin and was given a piece of paper with a QR-code and some numbers on it that said it was worth slightly more than $1 I would probably throw it away.
@_date: 2013-04-05 17:19:30
Dat fee percentage.
@_date: 2013-04-02 12:39:16
Kinda feeling the same thing, if I had held on to every bitcoin I've owned I would now have ~$30,000.
@_date: 2013-06-23 17:07:58
MUH FIAT!
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:39:51
Shit yes, put in a buy order a few hours ago to an unrelated service. It will however pay into my mtgox account, but in bitcoins then.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:19:03
I think it's 24h.
