I think more people are resorting to using Eth pairs for alt trading because BTC is dropping and Eth is doing well, also faster transfer between exchanges and wallets. There's lots of Dapps launching this year too so it's only natural we see Eth grow.

I think cryptos like REQ and OMG are trying to build that infrastructure for user friendly payments through dapp on the eth network, it's early days though.

Yeah you can use Gdax (coinbase's exchange, same account) to trade those crypto

Very insightful, I also agree with myself on many things

I wasn't really referring to or defending those groups, and I actually agree they are fascist and racist to some extent (at the least). However, Tommy Robinson left the EDL a while ago because of racist elements in the group and I think it's unfair to call him a Nazi. I've done my research and would recommend watching his Oxford Union speech, at least hear the guy out before you put him in the stand next to genocidal psychopaths.

Holding someone responsible for the actions of people who claim to follow him is a bit unfair... Do some research past Telegraph hit articles if you're going to slander someone on the internet please, you might actually learn something.

Bitcoin isn't really about reducing bank account fees, it's about having accountability in money. FIAT gets printed and thrown at the 1% when they fail, but when a working class bloke fails to pay his bills they take his house. The bottom line suffer when money is printed because everyone's $ suddenly becomes worth a little bit less.

I'm guessing the other 8% of millennial's must have just started their grad jobs at a bank.

It's political discrimination and sets a dangerous precedent, if it's illegal to discriminate based on ethnicity/gender I don't see why this is any different.

He's had a Bitcoin donation address for a while. It is concerning that PayPal is restricting the freedoms/censoring its customers though, and is a great example of why we need decentralisation.

Not beating inflation makes it hard to want to hold money in a bank, that's true. I think the bad opinion mostly comes from the sour taste they left in everyone's mouth after the financial crisis though. If they're going to screw us with poor interest rates, it'd be nice if they AT LEAST actually kept our money safe. 
Oh well, banks will be their own demise, their bad habits only pave the way for crypto and decentralisation to take their place.

Wikileaks broke all kinds of government related security laws so I can understand why accounts were closed, the US government is still hounding those responsible to this day. In contrast there's nowhere near the same amount of political force involved here, it seems to be down to PayPals discretion. It's another step in the wrong direction, towards censorship and corporate authoritarianism.

Racism is also a hate crime and is illegal, punishable in courts, not PayPals boardroom. It's also worth saying Tommy has never been found guilty of hate crimes.
