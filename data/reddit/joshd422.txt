Right, and equivalent units can stop having equal value as soon as it's possible to track/blacklist them, thus making them not fungible.

"To understand why, we have to analyze how bitcoin's current limited fungibility is creating real problems in the marketplace. For example, it's common for exchanges and merchants to discriminate between bitcoins based on the owner or their history. An example is that exchanges will attempt to block bitcoins that have been stolen, especially if the theft was well publicized. Other points of discrimination can extend to include bitcoins associated with drugs, gambling and other societal vices. But it's important to note, this can happen even in cases where the owner of those bitcoins hasn't engaged in any such behavior."
But what does David Vorick know, right?

Hmm, idk, maybe that has something to do with the fact that every cash transaction isn't recorded in an entirely transparent public ledger?

Still worrying if most of all btc is on exchanges, albeit for different reasons.

I have been thinking about doing this as a weekend hobby, kinda like those guys with metal detectors on the beach, only (I can't believe I'm saying this) even nerdier...

Incorrect. The coinbase can still be verified even if you don't know who has what. See here:

What if you could go back to 2011 and do it?
