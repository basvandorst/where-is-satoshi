As prices fall btcers buy and transfer in 8 years 99% will all be mined. It will all work out.

It's more interesting to see how the dems react If they counter protest, awesome. If they somehow magically get bipartisan about it.  I think that will raise a few eyebrows and red pill more Republicans that politics is all theater to keep the slaves attacking each other. ������

Nothing to squeeze they are at an Atl.  More money in squeezing longs into selling.

Nah some of us will casually send 1 to a place to gain even more BTC every month.

Don't fall for the trap or invest more than you can afford to lose.  BTC is scarce and all the autists are hoarding it to make normies insane.  
To address OP Just take out a loan and buy one if it bothers you so much.  Study something relevant and just move somewhere else and arbitrage your knowledge.  Like so many other early BTCers have done.  You can change governments you know.

Because btc is more profitable and has more liquidity. Supposedly they mine it and sell for more bch. Insert brainlet meme here.

In 2020 we are going from 12.5 HTC per block to 6.25 in 2028 we are going to 1.5.  Eventually the transaction fees need to suffice. You do the math mate. Happy hodling.

What kind of virtue signaling is this?  Having homeless people use crypto seems cruel because of the technological issues.  Also, they are just using Fiat in the end and having a sheet of many coins is just inflation on crypto which makes it less useful.  Might as well just use ZUCK bucks because the UX will probably be easier.  Lastly, poor people won't be using crypto because the fees are charged in the crypto even at 1 sat/byte the average fee will be too expensive if 1 sat is eventually equivalent to the purchasing power of a penny or a dollar.

Bitcoin doesnt care about any of this. Please dont call it a "crypto community".  I'm a bitcoiner only bitcoin is what I care about.  I dont care 1 iota �� about shitcoins that only served to enrich the scam creators.

I sent some signals on social media Facebook ex. When I start to get engagement I know I need to take some off. Depending on who contacts me and at what price.

I bought bitcoin at 1k in 2017 that's 8x I bought more at 3k end of 2018 that's 2.5x.  Bitcoin has been the best and fastest investment in my life.

Gold is probably a better hedge. If governments get complacent. Going back on a gold standard would stop them losing all the power. We all know the gold wont exist but it would take decades for it to play out.

The fees are priced in btc if the price of btc goes up so does the fees in both btc and usd value.

Wait until they find out you cant actually confiscate bitcoin.  The fact that they can't forcefully take these autists magic internet beans will drive the price through the roof.  Most people don't value anything they just covet what others value.

Mining fees, central banks on chain payments.  Plebs wont be finalizing on chain. You wont even be buying on the base later. You will be buying on the 3rd or 4th layer.

He kept them on a PC though.  He was not practicing good key storage or did he not just give them up?  Gold is easy to confiscate even easier if you just leave your bars on a table.

I own way more BTC than gold but this makes me bullish on gold...
