Great so by that logic you can call up just about any realtor and buy a house with your BTC completely tax free and it’s totally legal, right? 
Oh wait, you can’t do that at all. Here in the real world fiat is still king for better or worse and therefore it makes sense to retain as much of it as possible when selling your bitcoins on an exchange.

Again, 99% of realtors are only going to accept payment in the form of fiat. So if you made a million dollars on btc and wanted to buy a house with your returns you’d have to sell them on an exchange first. And that transaction would be taxed, unless you lived in a country where crypto was tax exempt. 
You’re being taxed twice, once for obtaining the money to buy the house and again for actually spending it. How are you not getting this?

“I will find an owner that sells it for BTC” thank you for conceding the point that 99% of people who sell houses will do so only if they’re paid in fiat. It’s not the “ultimate cash” if I can’t spend it just as easily as I can actual cash, genius.
Also I’m pretty sure if your government found out that you’d bought a house without declaring it they’d throw you in prison but who knows, maybe you live in Somalia.

So if you moved from say, Denmark to Germany (which doesn’t tax crypto) and flipped a stack of bitcoins for a bunch of euros, the danish government would know what you’d done? How though?
