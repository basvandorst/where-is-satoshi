If you read other (proper) CS papers, it isn't surprising at all: intro, problems, solution. That's all. I seldom see philosophy and vision etc on them, unless the paper is an overview article or written specifically on that subject.
@_date: 2018-08-25 09:33:11
A whitepaper is basically a technical report that describes how the thing could be built. That's all it is. I don't know why some people tried to turn that into some kind of grand vision.

Google bought Twitch TV (the game streaming site), and dogecoin tipping should be coming to twitch soon -- in the next few months, I think. So it seems to me that they're more likely to support existing coins rather than doing their own GoogleCoin.

I might get downvoted for saying this in this sub, but when it comes to tipping, you can also bring this idea to The community there is used to tipping as a means to reward content creators, and there have been some (unofficial) pushes to make dogecoin "the tipping currency of the Internet" with varying degree of success (mostly through the Reddit and twitter tipbot). I say try cross-post it there and see the responses you get.
And anyway, it's all open source .. So would be all possible for interested people to help you there.

@_date: 2014-05-17 02:36:34


This is probably the bit (heh) that is different for dogecoin. They don't care much whether they're taken seriously or not, since they just want to go 'to the moon' on their funny doge rocket. Hence they can repeatedly pull off all these interesting projects. They don't need to say anything to convince people either, actions speak louder than words.
But I agree with you. All other altcoins are bullshit.

Ok, if you stare hard enough into a noisy signal, you will usually see a pattern because that's just what the brain does. Example:  Technical 'analysis' *is* horseshit until you can answer this one crucial question: how confident are you in your prediction? And quantify that in number, please.

I think the "build our own" route is probably the most feasible path to pursue. If the platform manages to successfully raise a few rounds of micro financing, it would be easier to show that to kiva as proof that the idea works.
Also, you might want to post this idea to as well. They're very big on charitable donations over there, and they have just completed  recently. I think your idea will go well there.
That said, nobody likes a person who can all talk but is useless when it comes to implementation. Especially programmer type, we tend to have no patience for that and can spot bullshit from miles away. You have to convince us what's the special thing you bring to the table, beyond just idea (money? Connections?). Remember that ideas are cheap, it's the execution that matters.

Option (1): convert local currency A to BTC, send BTC from sender in country A to recipient in country B, then convert BTC back to local currency B -- with every step of conversion taking a 10% cut and the potential loss due to price volatility.
Or option (2): simply go to the bank, and initiate a SWIFT transfer at the cost of £20 to send money from country A to B. 
Most people will go with option (2).

It totally depends on your risk appetite. At which point do you 'break' and stop holding? If you buy 20 BTC at $500 each, and the price goes down each month until it hits $100 per BTC, your theoretical losses is now $8000. For many people who just dip their hands into bitcoin and trade without a plan, they'd have pulled out long ago out of emotion and sold at a lower price than they originally bought.

Diaspora tried that in the past and pretty much failed to take off, but then again, the developer was some college kids who didn't really have any code to show in the end. I'm hoping that now the time is ripe for another try at the concept. 
Facebook definitely seems to be scared shitless to remain relevant especially amongst the younger generation, with all its mad acquisition of Whatsapp and oculus recently.

Well, they get articles about the DogeCar published at print and online media too, so like CNN, The Verge, etc. It's a good ROi for a $50k marketing campaign, I'd say.

This calculation works as long as alts and all those bitcoin forks don't exist. However because they do exist, effectively when a BTC gets too expensive, money will pour out to the other coins instead.
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:58:52
Haha I'm an old timer myself (holding BTC since it was $40), but I've since realised that there's no point being a bitcoin maximalist. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:01:00
Yeah, only noobs look at the price per coin alone. And concludes it's 'inexpensive'
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:46:51
You're saying this now only because we're in a bull market. 
Don't forget that not long ago, btc was in a bear market that lasted for *years*. The price per BTC went down from the ATH of $1k in early 2014, down to the low of $200 in mid-2015. So if you put in your $650 at that time, you'd be watching your money going down.. And down.. And down every single day until it was worth $130 after one and a half year. It only recovered back to $1k after three years (in early 2017). I have no doubt we will hit $10k soon, but when reversal happens (and it will) a lot of weak hands, including millennial will pull out. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:14:00
People who believe in the fundamentals of bitcoin will do that for sure, but 'millenials' who first hear about crypto? Their hands are too weak. Chances are, they'll sell at a loss and give up.
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:49:28
It is apparent now that bitcoin is transitioning from the use case as a currency into a store of value. We won't be buying big Mac with Bitcoin. It's probably going to be some other coins with faster confirmation and cheaper transaction fee. My bet is on Ethereum.

I'm ignorant of the development process. Why does it take so long to port the latest bitcoin codebase to other alt-coins? Especially those that were forked from bitcoin in the first place and thus (presumably) have minimal changes.

By actively spending your BTC, your $40k Sega Genesis helped to support the growth of the bitcoin economy. The current value of a BTC can only go up to where it is now because each one of us contributed to the marketplace as a whole.
So I never regretted any of the takeaway food I've purchased using bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:08:44
Done this 3 years ago. Bought 5 BTCs for pennies (well, dollars) and just ignored them. The strategy seems to work fine so far. No anxiety from checking how much the price fluctuates daily etc :)

8888 is a big thing indeed for Chinese. Here's something interesting:
"The number 8 is considered extremely lucky, perhaps partly owing to its unique symmetry, and perhaps partly owing to the fact that the 8, laid on its side, resembles the Greek symbol for infinity. Additionally, in Mandarin Chinese, the sound byte for "eight" is close to that for "prosperity, wealth", while in Cantonese it is similar to the sound byte for "fortune".
To give an idea of how highly the number 8 is prized, the telephone number 8888-8888 was sold for a sum corresponding to USD $270,723 in Chengdu, the capital of China's Sichuan Province. Even the Chinese government got caught up in the euphoria over the number 8 in this olympic year, 2008: the opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics in Beijing began on the eigth of August (08/08/08), at precisely 8 minutes and 8 seconds past 8 PM, local Beijing time! Learn how to speak eight in Chinese"
I'm Chinese by descent. Personally I think those 8s are bullshit, but people from mainland China seem to like them a lot.
@_date: 2013-11-29 13:44:57
Chinese tend to be very practical (generalizing, of course). If you can convince them that the idea is sensible and *they can make money* from it, everything is good to go.
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:01:42
You forgot: work/earn. Do jobs where you get paid in bitcoins, or sell stuffs and accept bitcoin as payment. 
This is where we want to go for bitcoin to be accepted as a real currency by the public. This is also why I try to spend my BTC to buy stuff that I want, despite its built-in deflation.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:21:24


Even that still feels kind of dodgy .. well

@_date: 2013-11-27 17:17:45
Yeah I'd actually prefer if a BTC stays at 1000-ish. Psychologically it's a nice big number, and maybe more people would start spending their coins instead of all just hoarding it.

Its value proposition is a n00b-friendly digital currency. The doge is not even the whole point of dogecoin, it's more about introducing people to digital currency who would have been scared off by the perceived complexity of bitcoin.

That's why I think litecoin will catch up. People with loads of cash can buy BTC, the rest of us who're poorer will simply settle for a few LTCs.
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:57:42
Because you're assuming that everybody is a rational being (which is what economists are assuming as well, for the model to work). A lot of people needs money to pay for stuff in their life, and if a BTC is accepted for payment, they would spend it. Maybe not all, but part of it.

@_date: 2013-12-29 18:50:28


Because psychologically it's more satisfying to own 10000 - 20000 of doges, rather than 0.0014 of BTC. We can spin this whichever way we like by saying oh look at the micro and millibtc, but people always remember at the back of their minds that it's a fraction of *the real thing*, and there are dudes out there who own the whole item. Thousands of the whole item, in fact. I really can see dogecoin getting popular with the younger crowd for this reason.

I think I would end up making the right decision too, but before that I'd be severely tempted to keep the coins.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:13:52
Does it work for those outside the US as well ? I'm in the UK, if that matters.
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:03:54
Because we need to spend to make a bitcoin marketplace a reality. That's only possible by buying and selling goods and services in bitcoin, encouraging merchants to adopt bitcoin as a mode of payment. I spend a little bit of my coins every now and then, instead of hoarding them all, to buy stuffs i'd instead buy with pounds.
In the long run, if everybody does it, it will increase the BTC market share and increases the value of BTC for all of us. If it crashes, well at least I got Chinese food out of it.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:12:08
Chinese not keen on finding loopholes ? Hahahahaha. Clearly, my friend, you don't know Chinese. Business opportunities and money in China are made based on finding loopholes. Failing that, creating the loopholes yourself.

If you head to r/bitcoinuk, you'd see a number of us who're spending our hard-earned bitcoins to buy .. curries. One somewhat established takeaway site (takeaway.com) in the UK just starts to accept bitcoins for payment.
