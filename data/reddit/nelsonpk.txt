I agree that there are better alternatives for starters than QT, but in the longer term, if you are willing to run a node to support the network then please use QT as well. I run a full node, but don't use the wallet feature in QT - I use mycelium (and paper wallets for cold storage)

If user adoption is the thing that is wanted, then if and when LN or alternative is available and the fees are lower there, then users will migrate there, But LN etc aren't there yet and channels will need to be opened / closed in the case of LN - the current block size limit is a restriction on both of these scenarios. What use will LN etc be if we have already pushed a large number of potential users away to an alternative?

I would imagine that the average monthly gain on 1000btc at the moment would far offset your monthly rent and there is also the likelihood of the house price bubble bursting fairly soon. I'd HODL for the meantime and hedge your bets.

Actually, add this to Bitcoin as you are your own bank - would be a good basis for Andreas to develop a talk on future wallet requirements and design.
@_date: 2017-01-09 08:26:09
Yes, but the cost of opening and closing that channel could then be $16, which would be off-putting for many, On chain transaction fees would need to be way below that, so there needs to be spare capacity in the main chain to drive down the size of fee required there. I won't mention how that would occur..............

The way I believe it is envisaged is that in the Lightning network, there would be a commensurate micro fee for each transaction, however when that situation arrives I think we may need something smaller than a Satoshi for fees.

Even if the limit is raised to 8MB, unless those blocks are filled, the size won't be 8MB - it would need an 8x growth in transactions to do that (and probably more after Segwit), however an 8x growth in transactions would mean more adopters, which is what we want/need

I had endless problems with Virgin Media and tracked it down to their Superhub - it runs some log routine every once in a while, that allows packets to be dropped and files to get corrupted (pogoplug, NAS shares etc.) The modem in the hub seems bullet proof though, so get a router and turn the Superhub into bridge (modem only) mode and connect a router - problems over.

I'm in the UK and whilst mining I have also used Coinbase for purchases. Their limits start low at £500 per day, but rise after a while. Transfers for your Coinbase account to your wallet are quick ( I use MyCelium for short term funds) - I always do this immediately I have purchased them. Thereafter for longer term holdings I transfer my balance to a Trezor. You can set up your Trezor as a watch only address on MyCelium.

I still don't understand why we don't decrease the 10 minute interblock time and the reward proportionately to say a block every 2 minutes - I don't think that it would produce many more orphans and the loss would be smaller anyway. Yes, I know it would be a hard fork, but even so......

Bitcoin is still inflationary, but at a decreasing rate, which will cross across all currencies inflation rate in the near future - probably at the next halving. It's concept is to be eventually non-inflationary and marginally deflationary as people will lose / destroy them inadvertently when the last fraction has been mined.
@_date: 2017-05-31 08:55:15
I guess it might also lead to more empty blocks, due to varience of mining success, however even at only 50% of the increase in throughput, that would still make 2.5MB every 10 minutes.
@_date: 2017-05-31 11:18:10
"If the block frequency is very high, new blocks will be produced faster than blocks can be transmitted and verified" That's the part that I wonder whether there is any empirical evidence available. If one looks at blockchain.info, aside from the odd block mined by antpool. anything with a 2 minute gap from the previous block found seems to be totally full, which implies that a 2 minute interblock gap ought to be adequate.

There are other currencies than the dollar that have less value per unit (Belarus Ruble) and if they still exist when their smallest denomination = 1 satoshi, a Bitcoin would be worth a lot less than $1M. Given increasing adoption more zeroes should be needed in due course.

The on-chain transactions that open and close channels
@_date: 2017-06-02 04:08:48
No, it's the sum of the size of your unspent outputs. All 71 inputs will arrive at the destination as one unspent output (UTXO) and the fraction remaining from the sum of the inputs will be returned as change, This sort of transaction reduces the size of the UTXO set, which is good. I recently increased the payout threshold from the pool that I mine with to save generating so many UTXO and therefore not pay so high a fee when I eventually transfer them elsewhere. This assumes that you are only sending the 71 inputs to one output address.

It's not the miners that are making the fees high - you'd expect them to optimize the Satoshi per byte take - any sane person would - it's the restriction of the block size / block interval that is encouraging the users to bid higher and higher to be included, Segwit might alleviate the pressure / reduce the fees for a short time, but if LN channels are going to be used that will probably soak up the additional capacity, so we will be back to square one very quickly.

1 to open and 1 to close and only useful if there will be multiple transactions, otherwise a single transaction from Alice to Bob would use less resource.
