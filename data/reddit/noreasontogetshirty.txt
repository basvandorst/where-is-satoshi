My lawyer says there would be no point in sueing for legal costs since the bank acted "responsibly". My lawyer is cool, it is the banking regulations in my country. Also these regulations were written by the bank, and in this particular instance the bank went against their own regulations... WTF??
It has been 3 months and still no money.
@_date: 2017-02-08 13:20:07
It is in the Netherlands.

It is on the corner of haarlemerweg and bos en lommerweg. In the kiosk. It is called Caribou Cafe. Is nice coffee too.
@_date: 2017-02-28 12:42:05
It is a 2 way machine too.

No train station, just a kiosk on the hoek. I will add the location later.
@_date: 2017-03-04 20:42:05
Ok, how?
@_date: 2017-03-04 15:01:35
It gives money straight away.

I just went there today. 2 way machine buys and sells Bitcoin. Maximum buy without id is €2000, with id€5000. To sell maximum is €1500. 
Rates +6% for buying Bitcoin 
-10% for selling Bitcoin.

My business account was used by pishers, though I followed the strict AML regulations I have set, like always. The bank received a letter from the prosecutor from a different county stating my account had been used in a scam. Instead of containing me, the bank froze my account, took my money and gave it back to the foreign bank. 
They also put me on the blacklist of all financial institutions. This means no bank accounts, no businesses..
I only found out what happened when many payments did not show up.
Fast forward 2 months later the bank apologized said they made a mistake, and will give the money back. But it might take up to 12 months...
My despise for the banking sector grew a little fiercer this last month.

A person was phished whilst using his online bank. The phishes used his account to trade with me. They sent a id copy which matched the account name.
I followed my regulations.
@_date: 2017-03-04 15:05:49
I liked it better before..
@_date: 2017-03-01 00:53:07
It was 5%, I think.
@_date: 2017-03-01 09:09:25
I am going there on Saturday. I will update on it after then.

He is just a criminal lawyer.
@_date: 2017-01-13 18:52:51
Yes. I usually take 3-5%, though I think I'll take more to cover his fees.

Find the country with the best tax laws, preferably ones where the capital gains tax is low or non existent.  Move there. Get citizenship.  Open a bank account. Cash out your coins. Buy a boat...

It is great pr. But I just checked, it is buy only. Maximum purchase is 100 euros minimum is 20 euros. It takes 10% commission and transaction fee is 5 euros. So for 100 euros you end up with 85 euros or for a 20 euro buy you end with 13 euros of bitcoin.
For sure it is good that Bitcoin is in an international airport but when people buy from there the experience will not be a good one.

As the title says, this is a Bitxatm model. It is 3 years old. I would like 1000 Euros. The reason I am selling is because once out of 10 times when paying out the recycler gets stuck. I live a distance from the location so it sux to drive to fix the transaction. I am in the Netherlands. I can aide in the set up of the machine. The photo is from the net, but it is the same model, Sumo.
Message me for more details.

"Hello Harsha",

What is Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-07 05:56:25
I love him now..

This is the best Bitcoin meme I've ever seen.

It was the bill acceptor. It kept breaking. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:19:04
I spoke everyday for 3 weeks to bitxatm staff about the issue. They told me to contact the maker of the bill acceptor... I did have to explain more than a few times that I bought the atm from them and that they should resolve the problem. But they never did.
Currently I am still trying to fix the bitxatm.
@_date: 2017-07-15 11:09:36
It use to be a bitxatm. But too many issues were had. Now it is this monster.
