Pretty much the whole question is unclear.


So you want to know the money supply? For the USD the M2 is around $12 trillion. Not sure about other countries.


But you're also asking about assets like stocks and derivatives, which aren't really fiat at all. This part of the question makes it seem like you're asking about the world's capital stock. We can try to estimate this. Many countries seem to have a capital stock of around 4-5 years of national income (see Piketty's Capital in the 21st Century). Gross world product is around $74 trillion nominally. World income is world product minus depreciation, which we can estimate as 10%, giving us a world income of $67 trillion. So the world's capital stock is probably $300-$400 trillion. For the U.S. case alone, the capital stock is probably in the range of $70-$80 trillion. So, as you might expect, the capital stock is many times greater than M2.

Dollars are basically backed by a basket of goods/services. Central banks use monetary policy to ensure that the price of this basket of goods doesn't go up more than 2% a year. There were no such guarantees under the gold standard; inflation varied wildly from year to year. $1 in 1919 had the same buying power as $1.16 in 1920, $1.03 in 1921, $0.97 in 1922, and $0.99 in 1923. $1 in 1930 had the same purchasing power as $0.91 in 1931. Inflation was all over the place, which meant people had no idea what their money would actually buy from year to year. Now we enjoy very stable prices and modest inflation rates.

Except stocks actually entitle you to a company's profits. So in the long term, people who hold stocks will still get a stream of money from dividends and capital gains stemming from reinvestment.
