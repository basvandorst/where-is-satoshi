No KYC? WOW man. That is amazing and that is what i require for some small day trading. 
@_date: 2014-04-19 14:10:17
I don't like banks. Too much power and money. 
@_date: 2014-07-25 06:09:15
zero trading fee. Thats why. So again, Am i allowed to trade in there if i am not from china?

Dude you deserve some gold/mBTC, Unfortunately i don't have both of them with me now. So, i will give them as soon as i get my hands on it. You deserve it.

WOW. They have hitbtc. That is more than enough for me. I just wanted to trade off and make smaller profits. All the other exchanges in my country have higher exchange fees. For example, India's Bitcoin Backbone  Charges 3% for buying and 3% for selling. And fixed rates for buying and selling. No real time trading

Thank you fellow redditor. I was just using bitcoin as a mode of transaction. 
Here is a funny thing, 
My brother lives in USA (am in subcontinent). He asked for money, so i sent $200 worth Bitcoin when the transaction got confirmed, the value of the bitcoin rose about $10. This made me feel really happy. So wanted to give bitcoin trading a shot. 
I wanted to start of with really small amounts like $10 or something like that. 
Thanks for your help buddy.

@_date: 2014-07-25 06:26:16

@_date: 2014-06-04 08:09:22
biteasy anyone?
@_date: 2014-07-25 06:25:41
Ya i saw that too. But they want an invite code. I don't have one. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 19:15:34
Cool nice find. I will look closer in to that too. BTW as i am from india am i allowed to trade in Bitstamp?
@_date: 2014-07-07 16:34:07
Minimum investment in that exchange alone is around $70. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 18:28:49
well one more thing, As an Indian can i trade in Bitstamp or is it for a selected country like coinbase?
@_date: 2014-07-07 19:18:34
Ok. But they do accept international deposits right? So that means they should allow Indian traders too right? And thanks again for providing me with such information. Thanks fellow redditor. 
@_date: 2014-08-30 11:17:22
Thank you so much fellow redditor. I will contact Elizabeth and let you know how it pans out.

BTW, I am not non Profit. I know a non Profit. I will do one thing, I will ask the Non Profit organization fellows to do the necessary things (and also PM you) to get listed on that thread.
