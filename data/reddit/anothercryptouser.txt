Please help report it to the appstore as fraud (and possibly phishing), and give it a low rating for being false advertising!

I think you without much trouble can make a "UPS" for the Rasp with a simple powerbank for mobile phones. It probably does require an output of 5V/2.5A i would expect, but cant say for sure. 
I have just seen online that others do make this setup just for the fun of it.

Arh, so you feel for the old buxenger Ponzi, and now being so kind as to share you ref link.
Hope you didn't use any money on this. You will never earn them back! (you can buy these sites directly ready for use)

bitcoincash (dot) sucks is available it seems.
Should start a site with Roger Ver rage videos and Memes and make sure it gets a higher rank than bitcoin com...
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:08:29
More likely 666

Maybe post it in r/Jobs4Bitcoin or something similar.
Not many people would just work on websites for free, but there might be someone who would set something up for a cheap price.

I'm asking because someone keeps sending this over and over. 0.005 BTC with an $18 fee.
Following the address and seeing some of the other addresses it sends to, it seems to go nowhere (going in circles).

Its no Omni, as in Omni layer, but Omnia tek, a Pyramid scheme disguised as a MLM.

Multi Group Concern actually has a mining company - mining blocks of stone and minerals LOL  (source: wikipedia on Multi group stone)
But strangely the Multi group Concern hasn't got any news on their website about this new mining farm with Omnia.

They are not just dropping Bitcoin but both Bitcoin and BCH, due to double spending (when they use 0-confirmation payments).  
I don't know why people think its not possible to double spend "Bitcoin" Cash.

If Bitmain and all the other Bcash supporters stop mining Bitcoin and choose one of the btc-forked altcoins, there are most likely a lot more persons interested in Bitcoin as the real game-changing project in fields of currency, cryptography, decentralization, (soon) anonymity &amp; privacy and of course many new upcoming innovations we never will see in any of the other Bitcoin clones.
That alone will make more regular users interested in beginning mining at home with either some already owned hardware miners or just plenty of fast GPU's.
My guess is then that it wont take long before the first kickstarter projects emerge with the goal of creating a new range of miner hardware that is more effective at less power (since green energy is important apparently) and aiming to get the price down to a level where everybody can participate.
Also the mining software itself should be a whole new area to begin updating by building from scratch, and try to take better advantage of the hardware its running on.
Who knows, maybe someone can figure out a proper way to build a JavaScript miner to replace adds, that actually can make a contribution to the hashpower without overloading the visitors browser or CPU, now that assembler is on its way into new browser. (however I still have my doubts about browser bitcoin mining, but we never know..)
Its should have started sooner already, but Bitcoin and blockchain technology is still a difficult area that takes a tremendous effort to learn. But more and more books, guides and teaching classes are becoming available so it will slowly become easier, and then it will add a lot of new people to the scene with hopefully fresh new ideas for optimization, technology, anything new...

Why don't you do an actual check inside a block of the transactions BEING MADE?
You can see lots of people paying $0.10-$0.20/transaction, myself included.
According to many user complaints about various exchanges, we see many high withdrawal fees that are set automatically, and so will give a false idea of why these high fees are actually used.

I can log on to Entropay, but a popup tells me that their antifraud detector has temporarily restricted me from topping up. But going to their website it says all user are not able to top up their cards anymore, LOL.

I'm waiting for a small withdrawal to go through. It is only around 4 XMR, but after 30 hours or so it still says "Processing".
This is extremely annoying as price has dropped 6-8%, and still going downwards.
I could cancel it and trade into Fiat for a few days until price is turning upwards or try withdrawing a different coin. But apparently Bitfinex has added a limit of 1 withdrawal pr week when value is &lt; $1000, so this would make the coins locked on the exchange for one week.
Its only a small amount, but now its a matter of principle..

You can always verify the payments in your own system when they appear in the mempool and have 0 confirmations. The risk depends partially on what the customer is buying with the transaction.
You could then have some criteria for whether it is to risky to accept a specific 0-conf transaction, or if it should require 1 or more confirmations instead.
Criteria could be things like size of the transaction fee, what the sender is buying, customer reputation, etc..
If f. ex a transaction has almost zero fee, it could take hours before it confirms, and therefore would be at a higher risk. If the transfer is to purchase a product that is shipped next day, its still possible to cancel the order if payment doesn't confirm in time. Same with buying a 12 month subscription (f.ex like a VPN service), as it could also be cancelled quickly if transfer is stuck for to long or doesn't come through (in this case you would only lose a few days value of the service).
Something like crypto trading or swapping should of course never be done with only few confirmations, as this is a very high risk.
