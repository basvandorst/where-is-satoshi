Bitcoin clock assumes a block time of 10 minutes but  in practice it's averages out to slightly less than this due to increased hash rate i.e. miners solve the puzzle faster due to better hardware before the difficulty is adjusted to catch up.
You will notice that the date the predicted date for halving on bitcoin clock creeps forward ( or sooner ) over time.

The important quote paving the way for "micropayments for content" model:
Further, Biggar hinted that Time would potentially expand its acceptance to more properties, adding: "We hope to expand our partnership with Coinbase in the coming months to create more opportunities to provide greater value to our customers.”
In turn, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong remarked that the partnership will allow it to showcase how bitcoin can become another revenue stream as the publishing industry goes increasingly digital. The company has emphasized this value proposition in recent weeks, introduced a one-click tipping tool in November that it framed as a solution to smaller blogs and content creators.

The third OpenBazaar beta, “Tabriz,” has been released. With this release, the OpenBazaar team starts naming releases after great bazaars from all around the world, with the first being Tabriz, a market in Iran which is one of the oldest bazaars in the Middle East.
Tabriz is the first OpenBazaar release that runs on Windows. It is also available for OSX and Linux.
The urgent importance of OpenBazaar, a distributed and decentralized marketplace without central servers that can be shut down by the authorities, has been emphasized as a way forward after the Silk Road 2.0 crackdown saga. Regardless of the fate of other centralized drug markets on the dark net (which may well be honeypots at this time), it seems likely that sellers and buyers will stop trusting centralized services.
An Open Source Decentralized Online Marketplace Designed for E-Commerce
OpenBazaar, formerly known as DarkMarket, is an open source decentralized online marketplace designed for e-commerce, using the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Amir Taaki and a team of other developers created the first prototype in April 2014 at a Toronto Bitcoin Hackathon. DarkMarket was developed as a proof of concept in response to the seizure of the online marketplace Silk Road in October 2013. Taaki compared DarkMarket’s improvements on Silk Road to BitTorrent’s improvements on Napster. Indeed BitTorrent, the father of modern approaches to a decentralized Internet, proved to be a fast and fully operational replacement for Napster without the critical weakness of depending on a central server.
Soon after DarkMarket was revealed at the Hackathon, developer Brian Hoffman forked the project and renamed it “OpenBazaar.” The project is not specifically meant as a platform for illegal markets – rather, it’s intended for distributed general-purpose marketplaces like eBay – but when it’s operational it seems likely that it will be used for illegal operations as well, which the decentralized nature of the platform will make very hard to shut down.

You missed the point, it's the confusing mixture of units that is at issue here. I don't care whether it's micro-bits or bits (although I prefer "bits" and ultimately it seems as though it'll win). 
Whatever your point of view mixing bits, milli-bits and micro-bits HAS to be confusing and we should email Changetip to sort their act out.   
@_date: 2014-11-19 13:19:46
ok I spotted this option now but the point is I had looked for this before and not seen this. This should be the default setting. 
We all understand what millibits and microbits are ( i think ) but anyone new to bitcoin will be tipped in bits - then they will log into their brand new Changetip account and see a confusing array of millibits and microbits with no mention of bits. How the hell do we expect new people to understand this? 
I've changed my default setting to "bits" now .....ah that's better :)
@_date: 2014-09-30 09:46:58
Amazon have stated the only reason they haven't implemented Bitcoin is because they don't see the demand for it. A petition of 5,000 would be a good start in persuading them. 
Also with the recent announcement by Circle, adaption by Amazon will encourage a lot more adoption by people who don't understand Bitcoin. They would be able to sign up with Circle, buy some Bitcoin, then try it out on Amazon. Now that would be a tipping point.

"I did some analysis a while ago," Raoul Pal said. "[It] was to try and create a valuation framework that gives some value to bitcoin because nobody really knows that it's worth."
Pal, a former global macro fund manager and current author of the Global Macro Investor newsletter, is talking about the bizarre digital cryptocurrency that saw its value surge north of $1,200 a year ago.
"So I said OK well let's assume it's something like gold—There's a finite amount of it," Pal said in an interview with Grant Williams on Real Vision Television. "There's a finite amount that's been mined. The rest is underground. We kind of know how long it's going to take before all the gold is mined or before all the bitcoins. Put them in the same kind of equation we get a value of bitcoin and that value is a million dollars. Now, you'll never hear an analyst say this—but I don't mind this—I could be wrong by 90%, and it's still worth $100,000."
At the time of the interview, bitcoin was trading around $650. Right now, it's at around $364.

Coin Desk
Here's how bitcoin has traded since July 2010.
One concern people have about bitcoin is the volatility in price swings. Pal said the volatility is fine. He thinks that the upside is "astronomical" compared to the downside. 
Right now, bitcoin is still in its infancy and it's not going to go away because of the amount of people behind it.
Pal expects central banks will have to regulate bitcoin over time, but that's not a problem.
"What they can't do is destroy it and that's why bitcoin becomes incredibly interesting," he said.
Even though he has a high valuation, Pal doesn't recommend that people put their entire life savings in bitcoin. He suggested treating it like an option contract. 
Buying bitcoin is something Pal strongly believes in, especially because he thinks we are at risk of losing faith in money. He worries about the consequences of central banks are printing too much of it. There's an unfavorable perception that they're "rigging" the system by keeping rates low and buying the bond market.
His suggestion is to avoid the bond market.
Pal also thinks that people should be careful about how they own their gold. Because of the proliferation of derivatives and ETFs, gold is just the collateral to a highly-leveraged "monster." He thinks that it's best to buy physically unencumbered gold instead of paper gold.

"Why the SEC Would Approve the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust
If the SEC does approve the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF before March 11, it will be a first for the United States, but not the world.
Two Bitcoin exchange-traded notes (ETNs) have been trading on Nasdaq's Nordic exchange, based in Stockholm, since May 2015. The fact that these Bitcoin ETNs have been operating successfully for nearly two years should ease some of the SEC's concerns about approving an ETF based on a digital currency that's only existed since 2009.
The SEC was also thought to be worried about the largely unregulated Bitcoin trading in China – about one-third of global volume. But in January, the People's Bank of China imposed new regulations that restricted margin trading as well as high-frequency trading.
Another argument against SEC approval has to do with how the daily price of the ETF is set. In the S-1 filing, the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust said it plans to use the 4:00 p.m. auction price on the Gemini exchange – also owned and operated by the Winklevoss twins.
But that may point in favor of approval. The proposal to use Gemini to determine the NAV (net asset value) of each share did not appear in the S-1 until Amendment No. 6, filed last June – two years into the process. The decision to use Gemini, which meets all U.S. regulatory requirements, was likely done to ease SEC concerns.
And finally, the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust has filed a flurry of updates with the SEC just since Jan. 1, including a ninth amendment to its S-1 on Feb. 8, and two updates to its free writing prospectus (Feb. 9 and today).
With the approval deadline so close, a series of last-minute tweaks make little sense unless the SEC is seriously considering giving the Winklevoss ETF the green light."

New Coinbase Bitcoin Exchange Is the Best One Yet
By Money Morning,  January 28, 2015, 10:42:16 AM EDT AAA
With virtually no warning save a teaser tweet the day before, the Coinbase Bitcoin Exchange went live Monday.
This is a major step for Bitcoin. As the first licensed U.S.-based Bitcoin exchange , it will help legitimize the digital currency in the eyes of the public as well as the broader financial community.
It was no coincidence that Coinbase won $75 million in venture capital funding last week . Among the investors were the New York Stock Exchange, former Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: 
C) Chief Executive Officer Vikram Pandit, and Spanish banking giant Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (NYSE: BBVA ).
"To have an organized exchange that has the backing of thoughtful venture capitalists and investors addresses one of the main problems with Bitcoin: its extreme volatility," Duke University finance professor and cryptocurrency expert Campbell R. Harvey told The Wall Street Journal . "Bitcoin has been sorely in need of something like this."
But just as importantly, the Coinbase Bitcoin Exchange finally will give U.S. investors a safe, secure, and seamless option for trading Bitcoin.
Well, at least for investors in 24 states. Financial regulations require Coinbase to win approval on a state-by-state basis.
Even so, the Coinbase Bitcoin Exchange is a major step forward. Until now, U.S. Bitcoin traders had to use exchanges based overseas. But the lack of regulation, inadequate security, and difficulty in getting U.S. dollars in and out of these exchanges has made them extremely risky.
Remember, it was just about this time last year that the Japan-based Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange started to unravel . Mt. Gox was by far the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world.
When it collapsed in February 2014, it lost 750,000 customer bitcoins and 100,000 of its own. The Mt. Gox disaster remains a black mark on the digital currency. It's a big reason many have continued to avoid Bitcoin.
Mt. Gox hasn't been the only Bitcoin operation with security issues. Many Bitcoin wallet services and exchanges have been hacked over the past few years.
It's still happening. Just a few weeks ago, BitStamp - a large Bitcoin exchange based in Slovenia - was hacked. BitStamp said it lost 19,000 bitcoins worth about $5 million.
The lousy security at so many Bitcoin companies slowed mainstream adoption - and rightly so.
This is why the Coinbase Bitcoin Exchange will make a difference.
Early Bitcoin companies operated on the fringes of the financial world, unregulated and with little understanding of how to keep people's money safe. The Coinbase Exchange promises to change all that.
Just being regulated in the United States and by individual states makes the Coinbase Bitcoin Exchange much safer than overseas alternatives. Beyond being licensed and regulated, the Coinbase Exchange has put extensive security measures in place...
How the Coinbase Bitcoin Exchange Is Better
Coinbase went to great lengths to ensure the safety of customer money. Since Coinbase has already operated a wallet service, as well as an easy way to simply buy Bitcoin directly, it already has a robust security system.
For one thing, Coinbase has insurance. Few Bitcoin companies have bothered with insurance - so they had no way to cover losses.
Coinbase also keeps most of its bitcoins offline in "cold storage." That means the bitcoins are not linked to the Internet where hackers could get at them. In addition, the data is heavily encrypted and stored in multiple physical locations around the world.
To prevent internal theft, all Coinbase workers must pass a criminal background check. All employee hard drives are encrypted and use a two-step verification process.
Customers must use strong passwords. They are also subjected to the two-step verification process. That means when customers log-in to their Coinbase account, the company texts code to the customer's phone. They must type that code in to complete the log-in process. The code can't be re-used.
Not only that, but logging in from a different computer requires e-mail verification from that same computer.
I can vouch for the system's effectiveness. I just tried to log in to my Coinbase account from my work PC, but was blocked because I clicked on the e-mail verification that came from my iPad - a different device.
Other Details About the Coinbase Bitcoin Exchange
So it's secure, but how does it work?
First, users must have a Coinbase account. To trade Bitcoins on the exchange, a user must fund that account with either Bitcoin or U.S. dollars. Since Coinbase already allows customers to link to their personal bank accounts, fund transfers are far easier than with most foreign Bitcoin exchanges.
Customers will be able place orders to buy or sell at set prices. Buyers will be charged a 0.25% fee, while sellers will pay no fee. Customers also pay no fees for moving funds between their Coinbase wallet and exchange accounts.
Of course, the long-term question is whether the Coinbase Bitcoin Exchange will succeed. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong boldly told The Wall Street Journal that "our goal is to become the world's largest exchange."
The Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler, might have something to say about that. Last week they announced their own plan for a U.S.-based Bitcoin exchange called Gemini.
The Gemini Bitcoin exchange would partner with a New York-chartered bank. It's unclear if that means Gemini can bypass the state-by-state approval slowing Coinbase down. But it does mean Gemini is eligible for FDIC insurance.
In a Jan. 23 blog post, Cameron Winklevoss said that Gemini, too, will emphasize security.
"Your U.S. dollars on Gemini will be as safe and secure as they are in your bank account today," he wrote.
Having not one but two U.S.-based Bitcoin exchanges will do even more to speed Bitcoin adoption. So far, it looks like 2015 will indeed be a crucial turning point for the digital currency.
The Bottom Line : The arrival of the Coinbase Bitcoin Exchange does more than give legitimacy to the digital currency. Because it's regulated, U.S.-based and focused on security, the Coinbase exchange will also help build confidence in Bitcoin. And that, in turn, will speed adoption.
The New Year couldn't come soon enough for Bitcoin... But even as a lot of bad news grabbed the headlines, positive things were happening away from the spotlight. And those powerful trends have set the stage for some big leaps forward in 2015.Here's why this year will be pivotal for Bitcoin...

Can't you have a flag which marks one output as being the change when the transaction is being constructed. Then wallets can make sure each transaction is constructed with enough change to cover potential fees.   If the sender then wants to send a new transaction to replace the old then they can only reduce the value of output that has the flag. Recipients would have to  make sure that their output hasn't got the flag set and even if it did the sender wouldn't be able to steal the funds, all they could do is increase the fee i.e. the extra money would go to the miner not the sender.

Bitcoin is better than Gold in many ways ( Google bitcoin Vs Gold) but has not even reached 1% of Gold's market cap. There is a huge scope for price improvement but imho the only way it won't reach multiple times the current value is if another coin takes it's place. For that reason I've taken a small side bet with IOTA

The thing is - we don't know. I can think of plausible reason why the price might reach $300,000 to match the marketcap of Gold because Bitcoin is so much better than Gold in many ways. Equally some of the reasons you give might mean we never get another rally. There is nothing quite like this investment so it's hard to predict what will happen but fortune favors the brave!

Islam law prohibits Muslims from taking interest-bearing loans, which gives them limited options for moving funds. However, bitcoin could be a form of micro-financing that is approved or “halal” in Islam since the cryptocurrency doesn’t incur interest.
Matthew Joseph Martin, a 30-year-old developer who has previously worked with finance technology start-ups Boku and Xoom, came up with a bitcoin-based service for the Muslim market by providing micro-financing in Indonesia.
Loans Based on Bitcoin
“I was running a small business on the side and I had a cash flow issue. Some of my non-Muslim advisors suggested to just get a loan, but I knew interest-based loans are not allowed in Islam. So I started researching Sharia finance,” Martin shared. “After understanding what Islam advocates as a mode of financing, I started researching what exists in the market today.”
He found that there are over 220 million Muslims in Indonesia, mostly without any access to any kind of micro-financing that is approved under Islam. He noted that only 8% of financial products in Indonesia are compliant with the religion’s laws and that a micro-lending service based on bitcoin and profit-sharing could be a workaround.
“I realized this unserved need is a huge problem that needs to be solved. My background is in financial technology doing payments and remittance, so my experience building similar products was really an asset to help solve the problem,” Martin said.
His service called Blossom was launched in late 2014 and it works by collecting money from several individual investors then investing it in a profit-sharing model. Investors make money by collecting a share of the profit from the businesses that their investment helped to create and grow. The cryptocurrency bitcoin is used by Blossom to move money electronically, allowing for fast, verified, and safe money transfer. Since its launch, Blossom has been able to provide micro-financing to around 200 businesses.

This is a massively difficult question to answer. There are many risks but you can be sure they had all been constantly discussed and assessed over many years. It's clear to me that the world will adopt Cyptocurrencies in some form due to their usefulness and Bitcoin seems to have a (unassailable?)  head start at this current time. 
I originally invested in Bitcoin thinking it would have a 1 in 10 chance of success but that success would reap 100x rewards. After much research (and progress within Bitcoin) I now think it's more like a "1 in 3" or "1 in 2" chance of success.
Now seems to be a good time because the long term bear trend is  looking like turning into more of a bull trend. Also the media seem to be recognizing that bitcoin compares favorably with gold as a store of value and also a way of transferring money across borders of countries that have capital controls (see Greece and numerous other countries on the brink of bankruptcy). We are also seeing lots of interest in Bitcoin-linked stock market funds (see Bitcoin Tracker 1 fund and GBTC). Also the next halving will occurs roughly a year from now and look what has happened to Litecoin on the run-up to it's halving next month.
As always be careful, don't invest more than you can afford to lose and do your own research.

There is only once choice given the response of the miners, a user activated software fork. I predict this will be the way forward for future upgrades given that the miners can no longer be trusted to bring what's needed to the users. 
Think about it, malleability has been a major bug for a long period of time. Segwit fixes this and has many added bonuses included a significant scaling element and it also opens the door to many future innovations. It has been reviewed and tested endlessly. We want it but the miners won't signal for it.

To achieve the Market Cap of Gold bitcoin would be around $450,000. it could do this without the collapse of the dollar or mass adoption because it's better than Gold in so many ways.

Someone a while back suggested growing the block size by calculating the average block size of the last n blocks (say 2016 blocks) and then setting the new maximum block size to be a proportion (say 50%) bigger than this. So if this the average block size grows to 800KB, the new maximum block size would be 1.2MB.  This seems like an excellent way of aligning the growth of bitcoin adoption with the maximum size in each block. 
On average blocks would be gravitate to being two-thirds full allowing a nice fee structure to emerge for miners.  Also it's resistant to attack because it would be expensive to try and spam a rise in the block-size and then maintain that rise. Once the attack is over the previous maximum block size would just return anyway.
Maybe I'm missing something but I've yet to read a good counter argument to this. It's matches the very successful proven method of raising and lowering the difficulty every 2 weeks and follows the KISS principles (Keep it Simple, Stupid).  It's also a good compromise because the change in Max. block size would be less predictable/rigid than BIP101 but not as unpredictable as BIP100.

CardCash, the web’s largest secondary gift card marketplace, today announced that it will be accepting bitcoin payments through BitPay, the world’s largest bitcoin payment processor. The new integration allows CardCash customers to buy discounted gift cards with bitcoin, expands bitcoin user purchasing power to include more than 1,100 national and regional retailers, and brings the prepaid card industry and bitcoin closer together.
CardCash buys unwanted gift cards and then sells them at discounts up to 35% less than face value. Through this partnership with BitPay, customers can pay for their gift cards with bitcoin and shop at over 1,100 of the largest national and regional retailers, including Walmart, Delta Airlines, Macy’s, and Shell. Approximately 70% of gift cards on CardCash.com are e-cards, meaning most purchasers will receive their redeemable code in 30 minutes or less.
Gift cards make up a large percentage of overall bitcoin sales because they bridge the gapbetween bitcoin users and many major brands that do not yet accept bitcoin payments directly. Additionally, the significant savings offered by CardCash is expected to boost the success of this partnership to new heights.
Bitcoin, a pioneering digital payments currency, minimizes the risk of fraud and chargebacks through its use of secure cryptography. Similarly, CardCash has pioneered the current compliance and security standards for secondary gift card retailers. By now accepting bitcoin payments, CardCash will further improve customer security and reduce exposure to fraud.
“BitPay has developed a sophisticated bitcoin payment processing platform, which meets CardCash’s industry-leading compliance and security standards,” said Elliot Bohm, CEO of CardCash. “We continually look for ways to improve our customers’ shopping experience, and bitcoin helps ensure the fastest and most secure transactions possible.”
"Gift cards are one of the more popular categories of bitcoin sales we process” said Sony Singh, Chief Commercial Officer at BitPay. “We expect this partnership to expand on the success of Bitcoin in the prepaid card space, especially given CardCash’s substantial incentives and savings.”
About CardCash
Founded in 2008, CardCash offers the country’s largest and most secure selection of discounted gift cards online. The company has been ranked for three straight years on Forbes’ list of America’s Most Promising Companies, and for four straight years on the prestigious Inc. 500 list of the fastest growing private companies in America.
CardCash raised $6 million in equity funding from Guggenheim Partners in November 2013, and $6 million in debt funding in December of 2014 from Sterling National Bank. In 2014 CardCash acquired former rival Plastic Jungle, and entered into a strategic partnership with Incomm, a leading provider of connectivity and integrated point-of-sale technology solutions to retailers.

About BitPay
BitPay is the global leader in Bitcoin payment processing with offices throughout North America, Europe, and South America. The company has raised over $32 million from top investors including Index Ventures, Founders Fund, and Sir Richard Branson. With over four years of experience handling Bitcoin payments, BitPay is the industry's first and most experienced Bitcoin payment processor. Visit bitpay.com to learn more.

Thanks for the reply. 
I find this surprising because I would have thought there would be a way of separating the process of verification and mining. Also is there much evidence of miners doing this with the current 1MB limit?  
Whatever limit is chosen it seems this will always be a problem. At least with this proposal the maximum block size would only be (approx.) 50% bigger than the average block size. Under BIP101 it could be many times bigger until adoption catches up.

HENDERSON, NV / ACCESSWIRE / October 21, 2015 / MarilynJean Interactive (MJMI.QB) today announced it has entered into discussions with a provider of online gambling licenses and data hosting services.
The online gambling market is expected to exceed USD 40 billion in 2015. One of the biggest challenges faced by online gambling companies is facilitating funds transfer from users to the online operators. Credit card companies have been historically reluctant to integrate their systems with online gambling operators because of the chargeback potential. Bank transfers to online gambling sites are complicated by the fact that most operators are licensed in small countries outside the primary jurisdictions where most players reside. The result is that it can take several days for new users to open accounts. Countless potential new users are lost, having been put off by the hurdles of setting up new accounts and transferring funds.
Bitcoin offers a simple solution to these problems. Bitcoin transfers are both virtually instantaneous and verified multiple times through the Bitcoin blockchain and the myriad of Bitcoin miners connected to the network. Bitcoin transfers therefore solve both the speed and authentication issues faced by online gambling companies.
Many internet gambling operators also face the challenge of operating in a jurisdiction with a sophisticated enough telecommunications network to manage high bandwidth secure transactions. Many of the countries that offer internet gambling licenses are small and have less robust telecom networks.
MJMI has entered into discussions with a firm that offers internet gambling licenses in the country of Antigua. This firm simultaneously offers connected data services located on a native reserve in Canada. This combination allows its clients to both be licensed to offer real money wagering and operate their data centers on a first world telecommunications network. Canada is home to one of the world's largest publicly traded online gambling operators, Amaya Inc. (NASDAQ: AYA), parent company of mega-sites Pokerstars and Full Tilt Poker.
Owing to its ultra-low transfer cost, Bitcoin also offers the advantage of easily facilitating small dollar value transfers. This means that a site allowing much smaller wagers can still be profitable. Online gambling operators of poker rooms, for example, take a small percentage of the total value wagered by players in each hand, known as a rake. With traditional currency, known as FIAT, the transfer costs necessitate higher dollar amounts be sent by players so that the funds they transfer exceed the transfer fees. With Bitcoin, the potential exists for operators to offer users the option to transfer and wager much smaller amounts, therefore dramatically increasing the potential customer base.
Peter Janosi, MJMI's president said: "We are very excited to be in discussions with a potential partner in the online gambling space. Since we will not be targeting US customers, having a partner that can both facilitate a license in a credible jurisdiction like Antigua and offer data services in a first world country makes sense. They share our excitement about the potential Bitcoin brings to this multi-billion dollar industry. We look forward to further updating our shareholders as we make progress in this exciting space."
About MJMI
MJMI is in the business of providing safe and accessible services for the users of Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies.
Crypto-currencies are a medium of exchange using cryptography to secure transactions and control the creation of new units. Bitcoin became the first decentralized crypto-currency in 2009. Crypto-currency is produced at a rate which is defined when the system is created and publicly known. By contrast, in centralized banking and economic systems, such as the Federal Reserve System, corporate boards or governments control the supply of currency by printing units or demanding additions to digital banking ledgers. However, neither companies nor governments can produce units of crypto-currency and as such the value of crypto-currencies are completely based on supply and demand, free from any governmental control. Many people believe crypto-currencies, and in particular bitcoin, hold the promise of being the most significant advancement in global finance in modern history. The advent of bitcoin creates a secure, easily accessible and transferable transnational currency that is completely liberated from political influence.
MJMI is currently exploring partnerships in several verticals within the crypto-currency space, including the multi-billion dollar remittance market. Management believes that several industries, including both international remittances and online gambling are on the verge of being revolutionized by the use of Bitcoin to effect transactions.
MarilynJean Media Interactive is among the first publicly traded companies focussed on bitcoin and the crypto-currency space. The company's trading symbol is OCTQB:MJMI.

Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson decide to go on a camping trip. After dinner and a bottle of wine, they lay down for the night, and go to sleep.
Some hours later, Holmes awoke and nudged his faithful friend.
"Watson, look up at the sky and tell me what you see."
Watson replied, "I see millions of stars."
"What does that tell you?"
Watson pondered for a minute.
"Astronomically, it tells me that there are millions of galaxies and potentially billions of planets."
"Astrologically, I observe that Saturn is in Leo."
"Horologically, I deduce that the time is approximately a quarter past three."
"Theologically, I can see that God is all powerful and that we are small and insignificant."
"Meteorologically, I suspect that we will have a beautiful day tomorrow."
"What does it tell you, Holmes?"
Holmes was silent for a minute, then spoke: "Watson, you idiot. Someone has stolen our tent!"

Paying for goods online could be made simpler by a new group of internet and financial firms working towards a global web payments standard.
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web, to harmonise formats across the online world. It hopes to repeat the success it had standardising HTML code for website design and how online databases are organised.
“For the best chance of success, we will work with emerging payments such as the mobile payments being used in Africa and Bitcoin,” said Mr Telford-Reed.

Universal Air Travel Plan (UATP), a payment network owned by major international airlines such as American Airways, British Airways and Lufthansa, has partnered with bitcoin payment processor Bitnet.
The integration allows over 260 of UATP’s airlines to accept bitcoin through Bitnet, starting today. Introduced in 1936, UATP is credited with issuing the first-ever charge card. As of 2014, the company processes around $14m in payments from corporate customers, travel agents and retail consumers.
Additional UATP merchants include JetBlue, Qantas, US Airways and United Airlines.
Akif Khan, vice president of solutions strategy at Bitnet, said he expects the airline’s clients to enable the payment method given the high cost of credit card processing, challenges with fraud mitigation and the need for improved cross-border payment tools.
Khan told CoinDesk:
"It's very much in the airlines’ interest for the consumer to pay with bitcoin given that the airline will have cheaper fees and they know that money can't be taken away in a fraudulent transaction."
UATP vice president of marketing and communication Wendy Ward said her company’s decision reflects the "interest shown by many carriers" in bitcoin. Notably, UATP has long been an advocate for emerging payment methods, adding PayPal integration in 2009 and partnering with Alipay in 2013.....

Hard to say. It does seem a lot less likely there will be a split chain and that could lead to a price boost if segwit is successfully activated ( see what happened to Litecoin when segwit was activated there ). If you transfer your coins out you could miss out on this. Personally I'm leaving my coins where they are. Even if there is a split you will own coins on both chains providing you have the private keys.
