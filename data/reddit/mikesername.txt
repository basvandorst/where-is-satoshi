I'm not sure how much income tax a city brings in, but I'm sure as fuck it reaches that quantity and all around the same month...

It's not so much the anonymity, but the fact that piratebrowser will let people host websites in a p2p fashion. once you take out the need for physical servers and just put everything in a sort of "blockchain", you can't shut down any information because there's a million copies of it and you don't know who has it (ie, who is hosting it)
so, not that the *network* is distributed, but that the *information* is. like bittorrent

sure let's, as a city, sell hundreds of thousands of dollars in bitcoin simultaneously so that we can actually get the money we need. that won't affect anything

Damn, this is actually something I've wanted to see happen for a long time. P2P internet that's decentralized and anonymous.

Ah, I remember ATM fees. Then I made an Ally account. I'm not sure if Ally takes bitcoin but they definitely should.
The best is how they cover your ATM fees: you're still charged them at the point of withdrawal, but at the end of the month you get a bulk deposit back into your account.
Not to be the kinda guy that's toting *gasp* fiat currency, but if Ally did some stuff with bitcoin we could really see BTC take off.

Okay, I'll admit I didn't read the entire article but after ctrl+f'ing "google" on the article and this page I really need to ask, how exactly is changing *two letters* of Google's motto clever?
@_date: 2014-05-03 16:59:01
I don't get it
@_date: 2014-07-17 19:03:14
Yeah no shit

domain name, server, and ssl.

just because they didn't do it *well* doesn't mean that's not how you could do it. $164k is a lot of money, and unless this guy works with it very well then I doubt this startup will go far. it's unlikely as it is, because there still isn't a large-scale use case for bitcoin. people should be focusing on making more commerce available in bitcoin before trying to open up ways to get you to manage your money. this is like buying gas before you have a car.

is python the way to go? that's the only other real suggestion I've seen...

don't forget copying and pasting an address!

The process seems just a tad too lengthy and confusing at the moment, but it's definitely a big step towards the future.

That's just ridiculous. You simply don't need that much money to fund something like this. I'm sure his arsenal of shiny Apple products is really nice though.

Why do they keep saying 33M when 173,000 x ~$650 each is over 100M?
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:28:53
that's definitely worse...

Namecheap is fucking awesome. They regularly post deals and I've gotten 99-cent .coms from them before. Would recommend.

What if they all have bombs *and* senses of humor?
