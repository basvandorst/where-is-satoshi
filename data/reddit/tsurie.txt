Its just disgusting that government pulls up terrorism to push control. 
Totaly not in proportion. 
Cause some guy blows up in public space now and  then we gonna control and trace every citizen/visitor of a country. 
Fuck off.

Whats wrong with holding these coins?
Eth is awsome and bitcoin cash is a nice coin.

Seems like you are a Paypal fan, great! If u like Paypal and think there is nothing wrong with the nature and fundaments of it, good. Paypals features are up to date, sure. But this post :**PayPal uses outdated technology** is not referring to Paypals platform and tools to work with money. The fundaments and nature are outdated. Its a third party processor to work with fiat money (in a nutshell). We all know the reputation on fiat money and how rotten it, so yes u can say paypal is outdated. But what is new technologie?  
3 January 2009 first block was mined, on a blockchain system, public database the underlying technology from a digital decentralized currency Bitcoin. Its solves and heales the terminal classic currency ( $, €, £,) and their processors (Paypal, Visa, Mastercard,...).  
A good modern up to date currency/processor needs te rest on 5 pillars, Paypal doesnt mark even one of the pillars:
\- Open
\- Public
\- Neutral
\- Borderless
\- Cencorship resistance
So here i am, explaining and teaching you why paypal is outdated.

@_date: 2019-02-20 22:06:58
I dont think its a nice idea. I think decentralization is very important. There is a very thin line between security and hostaging. Large tech empires like samsung and governments play this game very well. 
@_date: 2019-10-14 12:37:28
Ho Ho, i never said that. Im just comparing it with tech giants. If they can get that big, Bitcoin will get bigger!

Thats what happens if u enslave the herd.  
People craving for freedom make them come up with freedom guaranteed tech, like encryption and everything based on it.  
Ofcourse gov is always throwing the same arguments to put that in question: Terrorism and childabuse.  
But those kind of things are totaly not in proportion with how gov is in control of everyones life.  
Fuck them.

Cutting all products from animals and thinking that that is the key is completly nuts and u will never sell that to me as healthy. The mass sugar consumption/addiction is an other discussion.  
If u compare that to vegans ofcourse vegan wins but u cant compare it.

Vegan? Thats realy bad for your body and the earth. 
Look at our teeth. Omnivore. 
The so self-important-vegan-saviours that stand so close to the nature doesnt even understand nature.
@_date: 2019-12-20 16:27:10
Why are the vegan-sided people always try to be so superior? If u tell them the truth or criticize their vision they fall back to some article they read on facebook from unknown source.   
The evolution of our species has proven that vegan is unhealty. We need meat. Not 500g a day, but we need it.  
Also from a respectable butcher, not a cow factory. I agree with that one.  
Vegans are so caught op in their religion.
@_date: 2019-12-20 19:12:37
We can trow arguments for hours. If u want to live this way good. I think its for dumb people.
@_date: 2019-12-20 16:39:40
(Planet) The industrie looks way different at vegan products then vegans do.  
They see it as a new class of income. The resources to construct vegan product (soja,tofu,whatever,..)  
Are much harder to harvest then classic material. Today they dont harvest it the bioway. No the kill every insect, rat/mouse, mole, bird, frog,lizard, snake to get max gain from their crops. Nice vegans, u saved a cow but killed 15 other species in order to produce the veganburgers.  
(Body) besides the fact that a level 99 vegan looks like a meth/heroin addict u can see that they are unhealthy.  
We need meat and products from animals. Not 500g a day. Not industrial if u wanna go bio, win.  
But the way vegans handle it dangerous and they should be protected for them selves.

100% FUD, government can not stop it. 
India citizen also confirmed that nothing like that is going on there.
IF THIS MIGHT BE TRUE,
Tip for every Indian who wants to be truly free: Invest now into crypto, so u can leave financialy that land of ignorant government. 
@_date: 2019-01-31 08:29:50
Yes, its a weird though tho that there are coins lost forever and its not changing something in value. 
@_date: 2019-09-10 17:38:30
Lol. Ez said behind your screen. 
Bitcoin is complex to explain in a oneliner. There are to many rabbit holes to understand before connecting all dots. 
He explained it actualy realy good. He made them curious and start thinking. Good job Akon.
@_date: 2018-07-07 08:07:24
Thats whats on my mind when i got into crypto one year ago.
Exchanges and everything thats supports btc needs to change it in satoshi.
One decimal is not enough, we need to use 1/1000000 (satoshi) everywhere. 
@_date: 2019-09-25 10:27:42
Advenced users? Its just writing down your private key on a paper sheet LOL. 
Even if you buy a hardware wallet, your key is also  stored on a paper sheet that comes with it.

It was just a commercial thought of me to share here. So far everyone is laughing with me.
if wallets are free to create, why not get a shitload of them and store it?
@_date: 2018-12-13 08:46:16
Yeah might be a stupid idea...
But remember email addresses?

@_date: 2018-12-13 09:20:26
Haha my idea is nuts 
@_date: 2018-12-13 10:46:35
Haha it is maybe a stupid idea, but hey whats wrong with ideas...
I thought it interesting having a shitload of wallet data 
@_date: 2018-12-13 14:02:26
Isnt it interesting to ask: what if we run out of wallets.
