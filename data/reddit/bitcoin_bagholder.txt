how did you buy it?
sell back
@_date: 2018-01-14 19:01:07
according to the casascius uberbills site only 22k are left that havent been redeemed. now that is scarce. plus they have all the forked coins on them. these will be a big auction houses eventually

waht is ytd?
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:51:41
i have never told anyone at work but they know I have some. i have told them through the years to just buy a little. now that bitcoin is $10k and they know they blew it, I see the resentment. Op is right. Give a vague answer and be humble.
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:06:18
me too. I think we will be okay though. :)

he is setting up the mother of all shorts on that 70&amp; call.
would be nice but to go up, but rn btc cant hold on to a 10&amp; gain  :/
@_date: 2018-05-12 16:50:13
you are probably right. not going to see those gains in bitcoin again. for one person to make $1 million just one person someone else has to lose a million. figure those numbers in the billions for the price to get into $50k\-$100k region. its zero sum. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 17:20:47
ok i think i know where you are coming from. you dont want me/anyone to post anything negative about bitcoin on here right? 
I was just pointing out the fact that I don't think 8x or 10x in five years is that great of a return for something that is :
-fixed in supply
-internet 2.0
-blockchain uses etc
-maybe 95% of the available supply is actually either lost or in someones possession as a long term holding. 
and the list goes on
if google announced that 95% of the stockholders agree to never sell their shares, google could never issue any more shares, and you could use the shares as a bartering instrument  how much do you think each share would fetch?

@_date: 2018-05-12 16:41:36
i just answered your question. I will not put another cent into it. because all it does is go down then in a couple years you get a pump. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 16:02:14
how many sold the top? im talking about holders.
@_date: 2018-05-12 15:07:58
i understand what you are saying about supply and demand. but what I am saying is why is price determined by exchanges when the real money and large blocks are trading on the otc? its counter intuitive to base price on small trades rather than large. what I am getting at is the select few on the exchanges which have control of the finite number of bitcoin on said bitcoin exchange can control the price regardless of what is happening outside the walls of the exchange. so there could be billions leaving or flowing into bitcoin in the otc, but the guy who has the most chips on the exchange controls the price to whatever he wants because he has the most chips in the game. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 16:19:24
bottom line and what I am getting at is the early adopter type of returns are never going to materialize. it is too late.
@_date: 2018-05-16 11:42:03
You might find that green dildo on a dead cat bounce after a nice big dump. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 00:22:29
yup :)
@_date: 2018-05-12 16:54:40
what exchange got hacked? not mt gox?
there was never a hack. there was just never enough fiat money to cover all redemptions so the hack smokescreen covered that up quick. think about it how many million bitcoin were trying to be cashed in at $1000. there was probably $10 million max if that and im being generous wired to gox back then. I remember i lived through it. it was a minor miracle if your funds somehow showed up in your gox account. most people never even thought of sending money there. so when people wanted to cash in, when you make something from thin air how the hell are you going to pay people? you close shop and scream bankruptcy or hack
@_date: 2018-05-11 21:03:16
im also done buying until we either hit $6500 or $10000. i have a feeling we are going to trade sideways for a while. no sense in tying up apital in a sideways market imo.
@_date: 2018-05-11 20:57:03
tell that to the traders maybe they will stop selling
@_date: 2018-05-12 16:59:11
tell you what? 
@_date: 2018-05-12 15:18:17
you people try to make bitcoin price action or trading seem so cut and dry. why?
whales determine the price, there is no negotiation. when they stop selling thats where the price is. have you ever seen a whale jump in and completely stop a dump and the price turn on a dime and go back up? why haven't we gone back to 5 digits price, someone obviously was convinced that bitcoin was worth $19k at one point what changed their mind and why didnt they buy the market back up to that point if they were buyers then?
@_date: 2018-05-12 16:04:49
plenty of $1 stocks went to $8, or .10 gone to .80cents
@_date: 2018-05-12 15:21:04
i have 90&amp; of the chips in the game why do I have to negotiate with other traders. I call the shots. this is a whales position on an exchange.
same goes for institutions on wall street. they call the shots they put the price where they want, there is no negotiation. they control the bid and the ask because they hold all the chips
@_date: 2018-05-12 21:12:19
I would rather go to the bottom than trade sideways for years

the coins will get to $30k. it takes time to become a millionaire. 
 if you bought $2000 in microsoft stock in 1986 and held it for 25 years it was worth $750000 in 1999. Bitcoin is even better.
@_date: 2017-02-10 13:46:29
yeah i bought another coin during the plunge. 
i had a feeling we were going to drop. whenever I feel that complacity when the price is rising, the rug always gets pulled out. so you have that sick feeling in your stomach that you dont know what is going to happen next. like right now.
@_date: 2017-02-05 00:01:26
I guess what I mean is whenever we make  the ath, at that split second everyone is ahead in the game."weak hands have sold long ago, people that have held to get out even are going to sell. so it pretty much leaves the long term hodlers and the new money. I think we are looking good.

when I see a post like this getting up voted and 200+ comments the tide is turning. a couple of years ago apost like this would have either been ignored or had 30 negative comments on how the seller is a fool for selling. something isnt quite right in cryptoland right now.
@_date: 2017-03-01 22:52:20
you can always sign up at gdax or gemini and put in a stop loss on the exchange. so if it plunges you will automatically sell.
@_date: 2017-03-03 17:06:48
Waht i do is sell on pumps and let the profits ride.
@_date: 2017-02-23 01:32:24
should be the other way around. if something is more risky there should be more return.

so for example if there is a pool of 1 million shares in the etf and they are .1 of a bitcoin. even if they are trading in the etf for say $50 each which would mean $5000 bitcoin, the price of bitcoin could still be $2500 right?

@_date: 2017-03-09 11:46:44
am i missing something. tell me if im wrong. if the etf is approved institutions can buy etf shares just like they can gbtc but on a more liquid scale. BUT does it matter what they are paying per share? I remember gbtc was 2x the price of bitcoin at one point. i guess what i am saying is those share are in essence another coin that has no bearing on the bitcoin exchange price. is this correct?
@_date: 2017-03-09 11:57:47
i guess what i am saying is that the etf doesnt and will not control the price of bitcoin. it still will be up to the exchanges correct?

BULL TRAP executed to perfection
@_date: 2017-03-01 22:14:01
i hope that it gets approved, but just looking at the price action I dont think its going to happen. We havent even had a $100 single day pump. You would think that if bitcoin has a shot at possibly doubling with the approval there would be some obvious serious buying. We have grinded are way up to $1225. It doesnt convince me that there is serious demand on the exchanges or the otc market. If there was extreme demand no one would be selling yet there are still quite a few sellers who are taking $20 per coin profit like any other day.
I have seen better bitcoin pumps in the past on absolutely zero news. Something should have leaked by now and if it was an approval otc traders would be buying everything in sight on the exchanges, but the markets are behaving like nothing is really going on. Yes we are up but this could be attributed to high mining fees, segwit etc etc. I just dont see any conviction in the buying. I hope I am wrong.
@_date: 2017-03-08 13:17:22

just a healthy correction. we will be back to $1300+ in a month. welcome to cryptos. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 23:26:51
my guess is that a large investor/speculator decided to take his $$ and run.
I see more sell side pressure for two reasons: the possiblity of a hard fork, bu or seg etc etc and there really isnt any catalyst to drive more $ into bitcoin right now. 
the etf disapproval was a real kick in the nuts tbh. idc if people say it wasnt that big of a deal. It was and I think they are just in denial. money that would go into bitcoin is now unfortunately moving into alts which isnt going to end well. crypto is a real mess right now.
@_date: 2017-03-06 11:01:39
thats cool. good for you :)
@_date: 2017-03-06 14:44:27
bitcoin exchanges make the price not the etf, gbtc was trading at a 50% premium at one time.
etf shares can trade at $500 or $5 each doesnt mean anything.

Bitcoin needs HUMAN market makers not mindless bots who will step up to the plate and buy when whales or big traders dump to keep an orderly market. Until there is a seed of doubt planted in whales or big traders that they may not get cheap coins again this cycle is going to keep happening. A rising price is helping but there just aren't enough buyers. Maybe when we get to a new ATH psychology will change? But until then its wash rinse repeat.

@_date: 2018-03-07 00:43:50
i am just going by what i see on bitcointalk. a 2011 bitcoin error ungraded would maybe fetch 1.4 btc at most. the premium has been eroding as the price of btc has been rising. so you have to look at it this way. for $15k what would you want ? 1.5 digital bitcoin or 1 btc coin? in the meantime the 1.5 looks like a better strategy, but 5-10yrs down the line i think the physical coins will be owned only by the wealthiest collectors there are just too few to go around.

it wont happen again until a smaller unit of bitcoin is being used. 30000 bitcoins now would get gobbled up before the price hit $1000 now. then it would have been double, forsure or possibly single digits

bitcoin atm.
i believe in sweden there is an investment vehicle on the stock exchange there
i am assuming you want to buy and not trade
@_date: 2016-10-23 13:03:05
no. just buy the bitcoin. unless you have free electricity and want to mine and try to find a block on your own. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 02:15:29
are you secure?? hmmmm. would you have issues if your dad dressed up in womens clothing?

how much money do you think college kids have to buy bitcoin? its amazing it went this high
@_date: 2017-05-29 03:10:51
sign up with x and plow the $200 into some bitcoin. forget about any kind of mining. barriers of entry have closed for most plebs. generate bitcoin by just earning fiat and buying bitcoin.

they are as solid or weak as all the other exchanges. they all have their problems. but remember for the most part polo is dealing with 1000 shitcoins that have zero worth and somehow they make it work. its amazing that there are still in business after all these years. theres only so many places they could even dump these shitcoins so  have to give them the benefit of the doubt on the time of payout. it sucked but i eventually received it. and if others will get paid and you probably will never hear another peep let alone some type of closure to their post. so i was giving the courtesy to let people know that I got paid and hopefully they will get paid too.

blame the ico people. they are draining all the fiat that took 3-4 years to build up. coins are made from nothing yet are being cashed out for fiat or in polos case bitcoin. and if they dont have enough bitcoin to cover all these shitcoin redemptions what can they do? 
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:14:05
i see quite a few kraken answers. remember you need to verify your identity on kraken first before you can do anything.
@_date: 2017-05-29 02:50:51
mostly their egos wont let them buy because they have to admit they were wrong. yes you will have to pay your dues and pay a higher price but the price jumps will be more pronounced. $200 to $2000 is 10x $800 profit
$2000 to $4000 1x and $2000 profit and so on.

it means time to sell and buy back later. heard the same things back in 2013.

ii think they make good eventually on everyones account but who knows when
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:11:50
get your coin off coinbase :p
@_date: 2017-07-22 00:29:24
i think there will be more private hedge funds and deep pocket investors jump on board but if anyone thinks that goldman, jp morgan or even your local credit union are going to get into cryptos you are crazy. way too risky and they have shareholders to answer to. institutions are making crazy $$ already and it is all rigged in their favor. why would they venture into crypto where they would be at the mercy of whales?
@_date: 2017-07-13 23:21:13
you are welcome friend :)

@_date: 2017-05-29 03:37:14
10000 coins sold right now with no bad news would hurt but i was trading on bitfinex when the bearwhale posted his 30k coin sale. now that was scary. he could have literally crushed the price to double digits if he pushed the wrong button. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 00:36:50
agree it is a little ridiculous. i guess if you are a newbee and check the price before you jump in, you can try to time it?
can fiat still be sent into bitfinex? I know it cant be withdrawn. :/
@_date: 2017-07-13 22:31:54
what is your wallet address my friend?

possibly the technology of smart contracts and blockchains but not the coins themselves.
@_date: 2017-05-29 02:03:09
lmao. bitcoin does exactly the opposite of the obvious. strong buy! 
whale coins(sells) are being gobbled up on every dip by deep pockets waiting on the sidelines. wait til terms like scarce and shortage make headlines. we be stackin!
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:30:01
Yes down 16% is a horrible crash in crypto. The sky is falling nooooooo!!!

@_date: 2017-06-10 23:14:15
i would still call them bitcoins. not to trick people but to keep the same name. it would have to be fully understood by everyone that they are bits.
or I always liked the term "credits" like from some of the old sci fi movies of the future.
@_date: 2017-07-15 23:58:23
yeah but they can hold your coins hostage

i finally received my withdrawal today. it took 5 days but they made good. I think they are fine. might just be overwhelmed. polo is solid. hang in there.
@_date: 2017-06-23 00:24:06
mbtc is too confusing.  example
me: hey joe you should buy some bitcoin.
joe: i was thinking about it i heard it has been doing well
me: yes ive made some good returns
joe: how much are they now
me: 2.68 mbtc
joe: what in the blue fuck are you talking about?? they were just at $3000 a few months ago.
me: oh yeah they were....but they moved the decimal point to make things easier and seem cheaper to entice the plebs to buy in and baghold.
joe:yeah ill pass
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:15:16
coinbase is playing with fire. on top of the outtages, they have to be hemorrhaging fiat cashing out 3 different coins. so there 3 sets of panic sellers btc ltc and eth that are trying to all sell at once. what a waste of money cashing out ltc. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 23:21:07
when everyone sells xD
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:59:54
is the traffic from sellers or people that want to buy? 
@_date: 2017-06-22 09:46:47
