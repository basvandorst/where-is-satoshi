well it's only psychologically different. Yes, if I sold out now, I would have made a lot of money on my 50 bucks, but, the way I see it, I want to stick with the bitcoin ride and see where it goes. 
the difference is that I have a lot to loose hypothetically, but in terms of real money put in, I don't have a lot to loose. Whereas, if someone had bought 5 btc at 1000$ each, he'd be loosing not only his hypothetical gains (like if he had sold out at 1200$). He'd be losing a huge initial investmen.
It's mostly just a psychological thing, but it's enough to keep me in.
are you staying in too?
I mean at the end of the day, did we ever want bitcoins to be accepted by a major central banking institution? Wasn't that what they were supposed to be fighting against? What happened in china may take away from people's idea that BTC is a get rich quick schee (which really only arose over the last few weeks anyways), but it is still an alternative currency and over long periods of time, it will still rise as the 21 million BTC are depleted.

I invested 50. But I have almost 2k worth of btc. I don't mean I have 50$ worth of bitcoins. I mean I bought 50$ worth of bitcoins. I have 3.

what's mBTC?

looking at the original slop of the btc graph before the spike (bubble) occured, it should level out at 5-600 or so if it goes back to normal. It seems that bitcoin always spikes but then falls back down to an original mean slope (which is always gradually positive). Am I correct about this?
I figure if it falls to 5 or 600 then it should level out and start slowly rising again until the next spike (which will probably be huge).
I would get very worried if it were to fall below 500$ though. I would probably sell out.
