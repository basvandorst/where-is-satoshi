I like your brilliant imagination but I won't take it.

Bitcoin will always be a speculative instrument and will exist as such.
Bitcoin has opened the door and taught us about cryptocurrency. It is the first but does not mean it will be the last.
IBM has created PC several decades ago and did not stop there, it evolved to present that is totally different from the first one.
So this would be most likely the future of Bitcoin, a new coin totally different from the first.
My thought is that a lone Bitcoin is not good enough for the future. It must be a family of coins that working together for the benefit all coins involved. With this, it could create stability and establish its role in the society as the vernacular currency.
Don't get me wrong, I am not telling Bitcoin has to go now. If you profit I am happy for you in this volatile condition, it is tough effort to make so. What I am conveying is that the future is different.

It only means they are looking for a support at this price level. imo

no fud, no fomo, just a piece of information. I hope I did not offend anybody

you are up against traders and they work like that, and they know the significance of SMA 200. Last month it hit that level and bounced. Will it repeat again?
@_date: 2018-03-16 12:09:35
the price at the moment is at sma 200, a crucial level to monitor
@_date: 2018-03-15 23:16:20
that's typical, it will try to lose all the weak hands. When everyone is so pessimistic and do not want to touch it, it will make a run and FOMO kicks-in to push it up and make new high and then selloff and the cycle begins again.

I agree, 8K must hold and needs to find support otherwise everyone will be tested at 6k. 
I saw some  PRs now and they know that this level is for support. I could not imagine how ugly it will be if the level fails.

Always choose a respected exchange with a good reputation.
What will happen then to the customer? just bye bye?
@_date: 2018-04-13 21:45:52
that's a good implementation.

just question, can a buyer pull out from escrow if he changed his mind of buying?
@_date: 2018-04-13 18:41:53
it seems that decentralized exchange (DEX) is picking-up.
I prefer this if those coins are not held by someone in the exchange.
Would you have thought on this one on how they operate?
@_date: 2018-04-13 18:36:00
there is good parallelism, is not?
Also, it might become like wildfire spreading creating a panic of being left alone
@_date: 2018-04-13 23:31:36
this guy call-out the bounce before it happens:
@_date: 2018-04-13 23:18:27
that's dodgy thing carrying big money to people you don't know.

Malta seems to be the favorite place for crypto exchange, who else moving? 
@_date: 2018-04-13 23:11:29
The bitcoin is the leader and every coin and token follow.
@_date: 2018-04-11 17:21:21
try coinbase they have a base in Europe 
@_date: 2018-04-13 11:05:22
Better to have our on DYOR
@_date: 2018-04-13 23:14:27
Malta is always in the news for Binance and other big exchanges wants to move to EU
@_date: 2018-04-13 18:53:58
the same thing in stocks, when the sentiment is full of negativity and it overwhelms, then sudden panic starts to emerge to the upside.
@_date: 2018-04-13 18:47:01
Brilliant. Love it.

Coinbase does not charge thru the IBAN transfer; and fast within 24 hours transfer.
