For those interested, I wrote a small Linux script to try to crack the openSSL encrypted string located at line 310 of the alpha layer. I did not have any success yet...
for i in $(cat ciphers.txt); do for j in $(cat keys.txt); do openssl enc -d $i -in encrypted -a -k $j -out cracks/$j$i.txt;done;done
ciphers.txt contains a list of ciphers to try. My current list is
\-aes-128-cbc -aes-128-ecb -aes-192-cbc -aes-192-ecb -aes-256-cbc -aes-256-ecb -bf -bf-cbc -bf-cfb -bf-ecb -bf-ofb -camellia-128-cbc -camellia-128-ecb -camellia-192-cbc -camellia-192-ecb -camellia-256-cbc -camellia-256-ecb -cast -cast-cbc -cast5-cbc -cast5-cfb -cast5-ecb -cast5-ofb -des -des-cbc -des-cfb -des-ecb -des-ede -des-ede-cbc -des-ede-cfb -des-ede-ofb -des-ede3 -des-ede3-cbc -des-ede3-cfb -des-ede3-ofb -des-ofb -des3 -desx -rc2 -rc2-40-cbc -rc2-64-cbc -rc2-cbc -rc2-cfb -rc2-ecb -rc2-ofb -rc4 -rc4-40 -seed -seed-cbc -seed-cfb -seed-ecb -seed-ofb
keys.txt contains a list of tentative keys.
Let me know if you find this helpful :)

In addition to what is encoded at line 310 of the alpha layer, there is (what seems to be) a smaller base64 encoded string in the LSB of the red channel of line 310. I was not able to give any meaning to it... If you have any insight don't hesitate.
EDIT: [uihwfebwuehifwejiuof]( found the smaller string is included in the bigger one. See [

L and K are the leading symbols of a private key matching a WIF compressed pubkey. [

I have it as well. Also not sure what to do with it...

Agreed. However, the bitstring hidden in the alpha channel is double base 64 encoded. So there might be different bases to use to solve the entire puzzle.

Nice I did not think about comparing those 2 strings. Not sure I am able to extract any meaning from this though... Was thinking about adding/substracting those 2 strings (in binary) but the resulting strings would contain 3 symbols (-1,0,1).
