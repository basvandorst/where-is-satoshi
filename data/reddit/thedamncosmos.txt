I'm just wondering about the external factors. Having CPU cycles constantly running would cost a user money from the electricity cost. Potentially a lot of money (depending on the machine or quantity of machines). **We know that the difficulty to mine bitcoins/litecoins and many other crypto currencies since the recent mainstream boom has increased exponentially, making the return of investment for mining to be energetically inefficient on the typical computer.** Perhaps though this may be less than the cost of using an internet provider. But would that last as the difficulty of mining certain crypto currencies rise further? Have you looked into factors like this?
On a side note, how would somebody connect to the network if there is no service provider allowing the initial connect to go through?
P.S. Removing facebook is as easy as logging out. Same logic as elections: every vote counts.     :)       although many of these services are not easy or convenient to abstain from. I understand.

Um, they specifically are designed for that purpose. They can theoretically solve NP-Complete problems as though they were P-Complete. [P vs NP]( Encryption is P-Complete while finding the private key that encrypted whatever it is you encrypted is NP-Complete.
