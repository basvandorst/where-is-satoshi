You realize you're listing things that occurred in a heavily regulated industry, right?


No, institutions should be, not the transactions. Get the difference?

Is a Chromebook a good computer to have dedicated solely to storing bitcoin?
Would a touchscreen work as protection against keyloggers?

Had the same thing happen to myself. After reaching out to them time and time again for nearly three months and getting the same canned response, they finally informed me that I would never again be permitted to use their service to purchase bitcoins due to security reasons. This was after almost 100 successful transactions of over 50 bitcoins. 
I've moved over to Circle, but unfortunately their weekly limit right now is way too low for me. Quite a frustrating position to be in. 
Edit: In case anyone from Coinbase is reading this, don't keep telling someone to "try again in a few weeks" if you already know they're on your blacklist. Cutting off services is one thing. Jerking people around for months on end is another.

I know right? This morning there was a line at the ATM and I was all like "the blockchain never has lines!". Of course the sheeple there gave me looks like *I'm* the crazy one.

The difference is a big one. One is voluntary while the other is done through force and coercion.

Work at a bank. Some of our customers get annoyed when we perform callbacks on wires that are usually between 1mm and 10mm USD. Most people just aren't aware how easy it can be to hack an email account and social engineer someone.

Haha, hysterical. People who adapt their economic views in order to fit their political views are not real economists. They are a joke to the profession.

Had no clue. I love him even more now.

The distinction is over who actually pushed the send button. The insurance company says that because Bitpay pushed the button, it shouldn't be covered. If a hacker had pushed the button, then they would have covered it.
