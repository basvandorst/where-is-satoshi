Just go to the bank (preferably a local bank or credit union) and open an account.  What is the problem?
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:50:55
Small local bank or credit union will love to have your business.

I don't understand why folks here use the big banks and then complain when they get dumped.  Use a small local bank or credit union that is happy to have your business.

The fact that this post is here, not deleted, and upvoted, along with reasonable discussion gives me renewed hope in Bitcoin.  If nothing is done soon, there is no doubt in my mind that Bitcoin's leadership of crypto will begin to fade.

I still don't know why anyone would tie up BTC in a Lightning channel?  Even if it works, how long will it take for people to trust leaving their BTC in an new and unproven network.  How long?

Yes, this is how local banks worked in the US before the Federal Reserve era.  You could transact with locals using the bank's issued notes, often after giving them your gold.

Depends on your bank but for me funds always clear on the second business day after you initiate the transaction from Circle.

If you have been buying every day then yes, you can't withdraw until your ACH dollars catch up to your buying.  It states clearly on the notifications on your balances how much you are overdrawn and what needs to clear before you can withdraw.  Hope this helps.
@_date: 2017-01-08 01:18:47
Account was approved same day I sent KYC Info.  Took a second day to do the wire and ACH was approved that same day.
@_date: 2017-08-09 18:55:59

@_date: 2017-01-07 00:44:28
I've had a positive experience after recently creating an account with them.  They do do full KYC as they should as a fully licensed financial institution. 
USD funding is either wire or ACH (no debit/credit cards), fees are very reasonable, ACH deposits are available for immediate buys (but as other have mentioned you can't withdraw your BTC until the ACH clears about 4 business days later.)  
The only odd inconvenience is they only support a very few number of banks for instant ACH validation.  If your bank is not one of them you must initiate a wire transfer for your first deposit and then ACH validation is very quick.  I had to do this and the entire process can usually be done in one day.  Also, they do credit you $20 to cover the usual wire fee from your bank.
There are $500/day, $15,000/mo ACH deposit limits.  I don't believe there are any limits on wire transfers.
So far, so good.

Yes.  I am purchasing a late model mfg certified used car from an American franchised car dealer this week.  They happen to have the exact vehicle I'm looking for.  All things being equal I am buying from them because I can use Bitcoin for the purchase.  Don't let folks here tell you that you must hold the BTC.  If your business requires that you convert to USD at time of sale then use Coinbase or Bitpay... both of which are reputable service providers in the US with a long track record.

While your enthusiasm for your cause is notable, you offer no valid argument as to why a 2MB block size upgrade to bitcoin is a bad thing. You then go on to attack numerous entities who have, for years, advanced the cause of cryptocurrency and bitcoin. They are big contributors to where we are today.  Your diatribe comes across as naive, childish and most likely does not help your cause.
