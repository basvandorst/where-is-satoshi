You're assuming a lot here. 
For starters, I'm not shitting on anyone. I was making a point. And second, that's exactly what the issue is for certain friends - they don't have the money to be spending. 
It's like buying into stocks. You don't look at how well Apple stocks are doing and then buy them because you'll likely lose money. Especially if you don't really have that sort of money to spend in the first place.

There's a difference between first Bitcoin purchase and doing some actual research before buying a digital currency. 
The people I mentioned above did 0 research and just looked at the prices. They wanted a get rich quick scheme.

This was inevitable. 
Bitcoin became way too famous and popular after it hit its peak late last year. I know friends who have no experience in digital currency, mining, investing or finance at all who bought Bitcoin. 
Time to wait for the hype to die down and then everything will be fine.

Excuse my ignorance but isn't the whole point of Bitcoin to become an alternative and better currency? Isn't that what everyone drools about when they say "I'm in it for the tech"? I thought the main reasoning behind it is that Bitcoin/crypto would become a much better and stronger currency than the ones in use now?

I'm assuming this is where you discovered you wasn't actually pressing "reply" on each comment but were rather posting a new one.
