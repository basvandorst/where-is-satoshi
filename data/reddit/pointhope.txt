I reckon we can take that to the bank, when we hit 50k in April....
@_date: 2018-01-01 11:39:45
Untill the core mofos sort it out there are many ways around the fees..
Like; today I bought dash transfered it to my Exodus wallet then exchanged to LTC.. easy peasy. 
I got plenty BTC I'm HODL'ing  so LTC is looking good now
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:49:36
Is there a difference?
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:52:09
All those things should be funded on a local(read small) government level.
Big government has only fucked up the big picture, big time.
@_date: 2018-01-01 11:49:24
Yepper it wont be long before 13k seemed cheap....
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:35:42
Zippy, zippy, probably had couple double espressos, 
Still was able to follow it.. not like it was rocket man shit

Excellent post, BTC is not about greed, but all about conservation. cheers man!
@_date: 2018-01-14 12:17:11
I ain't on Kraken, it sounds like shit.
But my policy is to never send more cash than you can afford to lose at any one time, do the transaction and send the coin to your wallet, then repeat.
Don't be greedy! 
@_date: 2018-01-01 11:43:58
which is fine..us hodl'rs are at an advantage
@_date: 2018-01-14 12:01:20
Which is why we need "global citizenship".
The hyper-inflated USD as world currency is done.
Bitcoin is the game changer!
@_date: 2018-01-01 11:27:22
Didn't anyone teach you about how patience is a key aspect to this crypto game.. you get too exited, you lose...bang 
Go back to your government job.  :(
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:48:51
We don't need anymore religion in the world.
What we all need is "global citizenship" and begin the culture of respect for our mother "The Earth".
Bitcoin makes this communication possible on many levels. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 14:59:13
LTC is just a convenient way to spend BTC.
I like both,  in addition to DASH, ZEC, ETH, XMR and others...
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:29:24
What is even harder to grasp, is how so many cling desperately to the massive load of bullshit fed to them by corporate sponsored government education.
Time to wake up darling! 
@_date: 2018-01-27 14:37:13
is that how one claims bch?
IMHO It ain't worth the risk of moving my btc to claim bullshit bch coin. even if it was clear how to do it.
I figure most of bch is in the hand of promoters like Bitmain.
@_date: 2018-01-01 11:18:26
I just locked up my BTC on a hardware nano dohicky in a safe. 
Kiss my ass government bankster cunts! 
Fuck you up the wazoo. Buying DASH and LTC now.
Fuck the government!
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:23:58
looks like the old divide and conquer paradigm again..
Bitcoin needs to stand unified and sort out the fee thing.
otherwise cunts like Roger Ver and the Federal Reserve will win. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:11:50
2018 will likely be the big "wake up". not just for crypto, but the very real fact that the days of USD supremacy are over...
I reckon March/April things will go nuts... and exceed crazy John McAfee predictions...
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:00:56
The NSA/CIA are holding Satoshi in a cryofreezer, just in case.

I'm sorry petrol is for enslaved TV baby pussies.
Ride a fucking bicycle!
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:23:01
bummer.. I just got into BTC in this past July.
BCH seemed like a scam back then with so little info about it.
Hey just buy back into BTC..
This time next year it will be 100k.
No worries!
 
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:01:47
Agree 100%...
What is also irritating you got clowns like Jeff Berwick promoting BCH and selling FUD about BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:59:01
I'm in it for the long haul...
Just ordered and paid for 2 antminer s9's.
I just started buying BTC in July, so I'm feeling like a fucking hero!
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:42:12
John McAfee just doubled down on his 500k prediction!
Now saying BTC will hit 1M by the end of 2020.

"Bitcoin is backed/guaranteed by nothing." 
My understanding is that BTC is backed by a globally distributed, decentralized computing network. The most powerful computing network ever known to humanity. The sophisticated POW algorithms give it high levels of security and immutability.
Mind I could be wrong, but I've got skin in the game for the long haul.
I suppose the electric or Internet could be shut off, but that strikes me a unlikely.
The USD is a giant fraud, 98% of it's value has been robbed since 1913! All government controlled fiat currency eventually fails.
Bitcoin is something entirely new under the sun and is game changer.
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:50:08
Exactly, America is owned by the big corporations and central banks.
"We the People" and the US constitution means very little when our greedy stinking politicians are in the pockets a wealthy elite.
Bitcoin is way for "We the People" to take back control.
Ron Paul is one of the few politicians who speaks the truth and is for the people.
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:30:35
What an obvious douchebag, fuck him and fuck BitcoinCash
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:26:00
That said I started buying BTC back in July.
So I be very happy indeed..
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:35:18
Time to sell will be when BTC hits $100M, about 3-5 years from now.
Hang on for the ride of your life!
Cheers, PH

When you are ready, you wont be needing the currency or currencies.
Point being; we are already perfect beings.
We just are brainwashed to think otherwise.

Breathe! Bitcoin is like fresh air, after being fed a lifetime of federal reserve garbage.
Listen to some Pink Floyd again...Breathe!

What kind of moron "happily pay" the IRS?
I reckon you are going to feel really fucking stupid when BTC hits $100k this time next year.
The bitcoin rocket to the moon hasn't even left the atmosphere.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:45:10
exactly right...for morning coffee there will be a starfucks coin. Lunch a pizza hut coin, dinner a big mac coin....
All instantly traded and exchanged on your precious android or Iphone.
and bitcoins will be worth 100M of obsolete fiat currency
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:28:31
I was thinking very rationally when I dumped money from a weak savings account into BTC back in July.
I'm a little drunk now and bought the kids new bicycles.
Cheers. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:37:14
The NSA, FBI, CIA know exactly where they are.
@_date: 2019-04-27 18:53:25
Best not to give the IRS any information at all.
Whatever you give they can use against you...
 They are criminals.

What a waste of resources and food.

Bitcoin brings in two features which have not been seen before in human history: Trustlessness and Immutability.
Sorry I think I drank some of Andreas Antonopoulis kool-aid and believe Bitcoin is going to be the Internet of money.
Therefore 100 million is quite likely.
The faith in the USD, Euro, and fiat is wanning fairly fast. 
@_date: 2019-04-24 10:15:26
Gold can be easily confiscated and purity compromised by corrupt greedy criminal government agents.
Bitcoin is immutable.
@_date: 2019-04-25 18:15:57
Bitcoin requires no permissions from governments or banking cartels.
@_date: 2018-03-10 12:10:10
buying bitcoin is about becoming you own bank. It's carries a bunch of responsibility.
be sure to manage you own keys and avoid leaving coin on exchanges.
Do study up.
Be prepared to HODL during the dips.
Buy the dips.
Understand what FUD and FOMO mean.
Learn patience and discipline, you are now your own banker.

I ran into this problem a few months ago with Xapo. We wen't back and forth, they requesting documents freeze my BTC, I submit documents they unfreeze.
Then they cancel the card. And request documents again and freeze my BTC. 
I finally wised up and moved my BTC away from them the next opportunity with success.
Never touch them again. At least I got my BTC back. 
Just lost the $20 paid for the card.
This time I'm going to try TenX for a card interface with BTC. Seems the Visa card outfits are causing much of the problems.
Eventually Visa will realize the opportunity Bitcoin represents it will get easier I reckon.
@_date: 2018-03-31 06:35:59
imho, 
the best way of looking at it is; 1 Bitcoin is worth 100,000,000 Satoshi.
By the time one Satoshi is worth 1 cent USD, we will be thinking in Satoshi.
Market cap by then will be in the 2-3 trillion USD range.
USD will be a joke currency.
@_date: 2018-03-08 03:59:33
What does not really make sense is how the entire crypto market dropped along with BTC.
I'm thinking there is more here than meets the eye.
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:46:08
after that the turmeric token, which might actually have some value..
