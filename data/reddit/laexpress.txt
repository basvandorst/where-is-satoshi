Get a Trezor even if you only have one Bitcoin. It's like $59 at the moment &amp; worth it even at the original $99 for the peace of mind.
@_date: 2016-08-10 09:49:40
one wrong move and... you don't control the keys anymore, ergo it's no longer your bitcoin.

They filled up all their beta testing slots and got almost-universal praise for it, so not sure how you arrived at that conclusion. Had to close due to US regulatory issues at the time, so it'll be interesting to see what happens next. 
@_date: 2016-04-05 11:07:07
You're right, that's much better. Bookmarked.

Still, you'd want to be cautious if she offers you a shower.

The article is mainly about Bitfinex &amp; price, someone seems to have picked up on the altcoin musings at the end.
@_date: 2016-04-16 21:22:12
Not sure how I can use this knowledge to my advantage, but always nice to see bitcoin representing truth again.
@_date: 2015-12-02 00:51:50
That's a really nice looking site. Kudos to the designers.
@_date: 2016-03-04 03:10:16
Ha, yeah sorry I was explaining like you were actually five :)
From what I can tell (from the Bitclub Network site as well as the video above) BCN is a kind of multi-level marketing scheme where you make money not from the product itself, but by recruiting new investors/members. Needless to say this only works while each layer is able to recruit more new members than the layer above it. Eventually the pool of potential members runs out &amp; most participants lose their money.

Don't forget the carbon paper. Do something as simple as change your address, and you'll be there with a ballpen and the smell of carbon paper... probably on a 5-page form.

As someone who bought some BTC the day before... I can relate to that.
@_date: 2016-03-14 07:48:38
It was Richard Gendal Brown who said that, wasn't it?

Even buying a candy bar from a vending machine is a form of smart contract. When discussing this topic, people often get caught up in complex situations involving human interactions and ignore the more basic use-cases.
@_date: 2016-03-29 22:05:59
Good, look forward to hearing whatever comes out.
@_date: 2016-03-07 10:21:48
I had to install Transmission on a new machine just last week. Luckily just before the 4th, so dodged a bullet there. Of course, I always keep backups, and not with Time Machine. So damage would've been minimal anyway. 
@_date: 2016-03-03 13:53:35
Fee bonanza for miners!
@_date: 2016-03-04 03:13:08
Difficulty does drop occasionally but it's nothing to worry about (unless the BTC price is plummeting, which it isn't). As long as mining stays profitable and new hardware is being sold, hashrates will keep going up.
@_date: 2016-03-29 05:27:17
Do you have anything to back this story up, eg: named sources, links to examples, or... anything really? 
@_date: 2016-03-28 10:45:46
Really, every episode of BU should end with someone getting fisted. Would make a great trademark outro.

If a man promises to give you money, but really wants you to give him more money instead, say no.
@_date: 2016-03-31 01:28:20
Interesting interview, though I probably would've preferred to hear more about the bitcoin side of things too. Junseth &amp; Chris seemed more titillated than anything, giggling like schoolgirls as they asked him for more details about his job – not unlike the guy on the phone who wanted to be fisted, really.
@_date: 2016-03-30 21:21:59
Reliance on oracles has always been my biggest problem with 'smart contracts'. Or at least the turing-complete kind.
@_date: 2016-06-01 23:06:11
Thanks! Will keep an eye out for it.
@_date: 2016-06-02 00:37:33
I wish there were actually bitcoin ubers that looked like that.
@_date: 2016-06-01 12:01:21
I expect plenty of high-pitched giggling from junseth whenever someone refers to a sex act.
@_date: 2016-06-01 21:05:44
Is there a link or reference to Snowden making that reference? I'm looking at his Twitter feed &amp; can't see anything. Was there an interview?
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:49:35
Once upon a time I would've been excited about that. Now I sit here, jaded, with only a huge mountain of coke for company.

It'll be more useful for remittances when you can cash out BTC at a kiosk like that (especially in the Philippines).

You're right, I'd be very surprised if the prosecutor suddenly said "we were too harsh on the guy, time to let him go."

The cracking sound you hear is not a blockchain splitting, it's the sound of egos shattering.

Being your own bank, Bitcoin style:
normie: "I forgot my password, is that bad?"
bitcoiner: "Hmm, maybe. Do you have your wallet seed phrase?"
normie: "My what?"

Soon there will be Bitcoin developers who weren't even born when the white paper was released. TBH, there probably already are a few.
@_date: 2017-04-08 22:52:28
I'm not really one of those "let's use Bitcoin everywhere" guys but this is still cool to see.
@_date: 2017-04-25 22:56:03
It's still a good wallet in its current form, I use it all the time.
@_date: 2017-04-08 23:15:49
Does that mean most Japanese are too afraid to go into a bar called Hackers Bar? ;)
@_date: 2016-02-22 08:09:41
"Blockchain could help... [insert any current world problem, challenge or inefficiency]" and you have about 95% of all articles written about blockchain technology in the past 2 years.

I liked what he did too. Word has it he got burned out after people blamed him for part of the fiasco at Bitcoinica, and then objected to his anarchist speeches around late 2013 when bitcoin was desperately trying to kiss regulatory ass. I enjoyed listening to those rants myself – they always inspired me to get more involved.
@_date: 2017-04-25 22:13:32
Well they sold tokens to the crowd, the sale is over and you can't trade them anywhere. Apart from all that, you're right.
@_date: 2017-04-11 01:45:49
Good review, but I think I've got an overload of bitcoin books at the moment. Might be good for bringing in new people though.
@_date: 2017-04-08 22:52:56
Even weirder.
@_date: 2016-02-22 19:35:02
My only knowledge of green beret tactics is from watching 'Rambo' – so I figured you could kill bitcoin by blowing away a room full of computers with an M-60 on each arm.
@_date: 2017-04-08 22:42:09
Have you ever used a bitcoin point-of-sale retail system? No-one ever expects you to wait for confirmations.
@_date: 2016-02-13 01:09:57
The problems you describe exist on the dark markets too, yet there are always far more 'honest' merchants than scammers – and that's despite most of the merchandise being illegal. The scammers are more likely to be operators of the centralized markets themselves. 
@_date: 2016-02-12 22:00:32
"... bitcoin’s image has become associated with 'speculators, profit-driven entrepreneurs, market-fundamentalist libertarians and technology fetishists'".
I couldn't give a crap whether people in developing countries use bitcoin or not – they're free to choose – but nor do I regard anything in that UN description as a negative.
@_date: 2017-04-08 22:40:39
Seems funny that they only announced the lawsuit in a roundabout way like that, but then... this is Bitfinex.
@_date: 2017-04-12 20:22:39
Yep: "Digital Gold" by Nathaniel Popper.

I like the slider on the total coins chart on that site. So many coins out there already, now's the time to collect them.
@_date: 2016-09-08 06:07:25
Been the case for years now, who cares?

If there's a bitcoin meetup in your local area, just go there &amp; ask people if they'd like to trade P2P. Otherwise, localbitcoins.
@_date: 2016-09-07 09:50:07
Damn, who'd that bank hire as its compliance officer – Hans Hermann Hoppe?
@_date: 2016-09-13 21:28:01
Has anyone tried the OTC/P2P [mobile trading app by BitKan]( Chinese service but with multiple language versions – haven't tried it yet myself but it connects you directly with individual buyers around the world. Built-in wallet, reputation scores, price info etc.

Those big buckets full of buds on his desk... omg. How does anyone get any work done there?

The beauty of bitcoin is they can't outlaw it. Or at least, no more than they've been able to outlaw bittorrent, Tor, or copyrighted material on YouTube. Cash, on the other hand, is the government's own tool and thus easy to restrict. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 08:54:21
Yes &amp; that's what happened when Ethereum split into ETH and ETC. However some exchanges didn't permit the second token (and were accused of keeping it for themselves). More value at stake with Bitcoin though so hopefully they're more likely to allow it.

On the upside, holidays in the UK have become affordable for the first time in decades.
@_date: 2017-05-10 09:53:08
Of course, it's just their word. But the local regulators are watching them a lot more closely than the Chinese were.
@_date: 2017-05-21 08:56:00
Well, yes so long as both coins retain their value. If one or both of them drops massively, you don't get to double your funds.
@_date: 2016-05-13 03:15:14
Title is a bit misleading here – e-Residency does not allow you to vote, and Estonia does not have 'voting via blockchain' for anyone, even citizens.

Still holding out hope that someone in China finds a really novel use for bitcoin (other than converting cheap electricity that is).

If enough Twitter users add 'UASF' to their display names, does it activate a fork?

If no-one ever won at casinos, no-one would ever play. Rather it's a tax on people who can't do math and calculate odds, which I believe is a righteous thing.

The project uses Colu (formerly colored coins) on the Bitcoin blockchain, and is also compatible with others.

This is an old story, it wasn't true then and it's not true now. I'm surprised you haven't heard of it actually.

A lot of companies use the word 'blockchain' as a euphemism for 'bitcoin' anyway. With a logo we'd at least know if they were doing that, I guess
@_date: 2016-05-13 01:43:32
Are you saying Bitcoin isn't useful for all these things?
@_date: 2016-05-13 01:46:32
There is no 'official' bitcoin site anyway.

You say exploit, I say leverage – and why would he, or anyone else, not make the most of an opportunity?

Kinda sad that people feel they even need to ask. We've become a permission-only society.
@_date: 2016-05-07 03:24:57
What repercussions? This whole so-called fiasco has not affected bitcoin's price or development in the slightest.
@_date: 2016-05-13 00:24:03
Everyone loves to think they're too classy for gambling, sex, drugs and tabloid news. In reality everyone loves them.

This is how bitcoin trading should be done, eff exchanges &amp; regulation.
@_date: 2016-05-13 01:22:10
I would love to know too. The problem is the companies themselves usually won't disclose – or they'll say it's a private blockchain but they're also experimenting with the bitcoin one on the side. Sometimes they're petrified of using the word 'bitcoin' lest it frighten off investors. This will change in time, I'm sure.
@_date: 2017-07-07 06:52:47
This was news over a week ago (better article here):
@_date: 2016-07-13 10:37:06
Japan, China or the whole of Asia – this is where economic &amp; political circumstances are right for something like bitcoin to take off. 
@_date: 2016-07-18 03:11:35
Bitcoin lending (to anyone, let alone to strangers) is insanity. Not only will people run off with your money, but suppose you take out a 20 BTC loan &amp; the price triples, as it has done in the past year or so.
@_date: 2016-07-09 12:01:44
Well, that was bound to happen. Anyone surprised?

No-one seemed particularly concerned over the shutdowns, but at the same time no-one wanted to comment publicly.
@_date: 2017-06-03 20:29:52
I agree, bitcoin news should be all-segwit, all the time, and no other aspects of the ecosystem should be acknowledged.
