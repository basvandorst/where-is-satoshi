I may just be giving the processing fee. There are individual scheme fees associated for MC, Visa, AMEX etc.
So from a merchant side i'm not sure what the average total would be. I work for a PSP so got locked into our own bits, sorry :).

Payments are all volume based. Unless you're processing the millions of transactions Valve do then you won't get that rate.

Are you sure it is DR facilitating and not just these companies adding it in separately?
Do you have any official word from DR on this?

I have a slightly weird idea. I suggest we hand out 10 of the bitcoins to various journalists,industry thought leaders and maybe even youtubers. A number would be chosen to receive .1/2 bitcoin with the caveat that all of the bitcoin should be spent on items (physical or digital goods...so using it as a currency).
The people to target would not be heavily involved with bitcoin and hopefully have an audience that is not aware or interested in it at all. 
For example we could send some to a writer for Eurogamer or RPS and get them to see what they can buy for BTC in the gaming sector.
Another could go to a design blog or magazine to see what interesting design items they can buy.
Then maybe somewhere with a heavy female readership.
The end game would be the reporter writing a blog, article or creating a video piece about their experience with bitcoin, what they were able to buy and maybe what charitable donations they made hopefully resulting in different groups becoming aware of bitcoin (and pique their interest in getting involved).
This may be terrible but I thought I would throw it out there :).

Full report: 
Breakouts by country as well.

At their size they are likely paying between 0.5% and 1.5% in fees. Hard to be more specific without seeing their numbers.
Educated guess from someone who works for a large payment processor.

One thing I would be interested in finding out is what the current darknet bitcoin uses (drugs etc.) add up to as a market cap. Surely even if all mainstream use dried up the value of this market would be the lowest it could go?

What country? Sorry if prying I am just interested :).

I am with Barclays and have had no problem with my transfers over the past few months. Then again my movements are almost all UK based (I tend to work with local sellers/buyers).
It is likely just an auto detect fraud issue due to you sending a large amount of money outside of the country. To their system this will look suspicious and they will hold the account until they can verify the issue. If you had setup mobile banking then you would have received a text asking if this was a transaction you made and to send a text confirming this. The account would then be unblocked after 15 minutes.
I have had this happen a a couple of times and the mobile banking thing sorts it very quickly. Barclays on the whole are very good. Their online banking UI is probably the best of all the UK banks, their mobile app is great and pingit is useful for small bitcoin transfers (though you can use pingit with any bank).
Oh and banks completely shut for weekends so nothing would have been done past Friday afternoon. I am hoping this is just a standard fraud screening thing but let us know if not!
