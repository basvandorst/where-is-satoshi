If all mining nodes change rules by concensus, how does a non-mining node stop them? There is no rejection signalling. If a node stops propagating blocks, it effectively dissapears from the network. non-mining node have no concensus power in bitcoin. If all non-mining nodes stops propagating, bitcoin works with only mining nodes and the network actually propagates data faster.
There is an economic nash equilibrium that means miners are less optimum trying to change the rules. If they collude and artificially raise block rewards for themselves, they create miner inflation. They will basically end up incentivising MORE competition and cost themselves more in production per coin. When block rewards are diminishing, there needs to be large blocks to allow lots of TX and thus TX fees to pay miners. without onchain scaling, bitcoin mining dies and so will bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:48:08
I'll chuck the shoe on the other foot. If you think non-mining nodes can keep miners in check with concensus, then it would be easy and fairly cheap for bankers or government agencies to spin up millions of VM nodes on servers around the world and win concensus and take over bitcoin. non-mining nodes have no concensus power and it would be dangerous if they did.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:45:39
It'd be a good start if you learnt that non-mining nodes do nothing but offer impedance to the network and slow it down, thus weakening security.
That way all your maths should be directed at mining rewards at millions of dollars per block mined. Now, think what kind of hardware miners would throw at competing for that market.
non-mining nodes don't matter, your economics fail.

full nodes cannot do anything. rejecting the miners means you are stuck on an orphaned chain. Yes, the miners are the 3rd party in bitcoin and they HAVE to be trusted. Describing bitcoin as a trustless system is a bit misleading. It is not a completely trustless system, you are trusting the economic code of bitcoin. You are trusting the Bitcoin system. It is far easier to trust miners that have a lot invested than trust a lot of nodes that have very little invested and have positive incentive to cheat for small amounts. IF YOU HAVE A LOT INVESTED, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO CHEAT FOR SMALLER AMOUNTS. That is the mining game and incentives are designed to keep miners honest, making it exponentially more expensive to cheat than to be honest. That is the genius security mechanism of bitcoin that makes it all work. That is why you need to scale onchain or bitcoin fails because mining fails. You cannot protect bitcoin integrity by taking fees offchain and reducing miner incentives. Once people understand this, then bitcoin scaling debate is a non-issue. And yes, the barrier to entry for miners does go up, but that is the whole point. It was never meant to be about making mining easy. If mining was cheap and easy, nobody would pay much for bitcoins and just mine it on their PCs at home and it's value stays low like in the early years. It is about making use of money easy for everyone. It needs to build up the world's most powerful network of collaborative mining computers so that even governments with supercomputing power cannot overrun the mining network. This is why asic mining ability is a strong point as even banks of readily available GPUs owned by intelligence agencies cannot compete. It is at that point that Bitcoin truly becomes invincible to banking and governmental threat.

low performance non-mining nodes lag the network. Validating your own transactions is superfluous. If you send your TX and it went straight to miners, it would be validated by thousands of miners within seconds and included in the mempool and propagated faster thru the mining network without non-mining nodes offering impedance and noise. To attack mining validation right now would require about $400,000 per hour of computing power, so unless you need to validate transactions comparable to that price, nobody is economically profitable to try and attack a 0-conf TX for under $100k if it costs so much more to achieve it. If they had that kind of computing power, they would not be interested in $100k, they would be chasing the $800,000 per hour in mining rewards and fees and averaging over $400k per hour. Economic incentives is how the network is protected in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:58:35
they would not use it because miners will put the much lower fee Segwit TX down the bottom and probably stuck in mempool. Segwit creates a dichotomy for mining TX and along with restricted blocksize, it will ruin bitcoin in the long run if forced to be used.

@_date: 2017-12-09 21:56:51
If you limit the number of TX, you get high variance in TX fees per block. If you allow more TX per block then you get lower variance in TX fees. Without reliance on TX fees, mining power will be weaker with higher variance in TX fees. It is delusional to think that mining stability will come from capping TX volume.

@_date: 2017-12-05 20:24:00
nodes in the bitcoin world refer to mining nodes. There is no such consideration for non-mining nodes which are basically just listening posts and lag the network. Validation is invalid without proof-of-work AND being the first to generate and broadcast it. Performance matters and it's being paid for thru mining rewards and fees. Low performance non-mining nodes are not even visible to miners and offer no concensus or decentralisation benefit.
Once you get the non-mining node out of the equation then bitcoin economics makes and onchain scaling makes sense. Decentralisation will come with mining competition just like how the larger a state lottery jackpot, the more people jump in try and win it. A non-mining node is like a reporter reporting on the Jackpot and who won it after the fact.

The paper you refer to has a premise that extreme high variance in TX volume is required to attack it. They also have the assumption that TX coming in and mining process are not parallel processes. It is working with hypotheticals that are non-sensical with a flood of incoming TX. It has very flawed game theory assumptions.

The problem is not storing the LN graph but updating it dynamically. So now instead of scaling blocksize, we are scaling node mapping which increases magnitude quicker than blocksize. Dynamic node mapping is a massive bandwidth headfuck as nodes increase. It is flawed solutions to a simple problem.

Get off the high horse. If there were no asics, supercomputing farms like those belonging to intelligence agencies and banking institutions and cloud providers could and would have the incentives to overthrow mining if bitcoin became big enough threat to them. Asic hashpower efficiencies as a single purpose chip is a boon for bitcoin security once you understand the threat. Asics is the ONLY real world protection for bitcoin mining against superpowers. On top of that, the amount of electricity used is reduced thanks to asics. To actually say that 10,000 CPUs could do it just as well is contradictory in that you believe inefficiencies is the key to efficiencies. Bitcoin security is a race for more efficient hashpower, not a race for less efficient hashpower.

Total TX fees are supposed to scale linearly with blocksize. It allows fee per TX to remain low for users while fees compensate for block reward decreases. This is why onchain scaling is important as it maintains the correct equilibirum.
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:30:53
No wrong. Segwit uses block weighting to dictate byte fee. Segwit TX have a byte price that is 25% of non-segwit. If we squeeze in maybe 1.7x segwit TX into a block, then the non-segwit TX block would still pay about 2.5 times more for miners at the same Sat/byte price. It's like telling miners, hey why don't you do the same work for less than half pay. Just won't work economically in the long run. As for the compatibility argument, segwit requires all client ends and wallets to add a lot of code or segwit addresses becomes anyone-spend addresses. It breaks external compatibility unlike onchain scaling.

if you understand the economic code of bitcoin, you will know that the hashpower competition chasing mining rewards is always magnitudes more powerful than is needed to process transactions. Non-mining nodes (read-only node) does not do anything to support network security. They are not a node in the true sense. The assumption that there would be "far fewer" nodes is simply naive. Miners did not invest 10's of millions to try and shit in their own backyard and cheat the ecosystem. They spent the money to commit to the economic code and make the ecosystem bigger so their infrastructure has the best ROI. Cheating the system guarantees them the worst ROI. There is no fundamental difference in the mining distribution of BTC or BCH at any comparable scale. The argument for mining decentralisation is pretty much FUD.

For years, merchants were happy to accept bitcoin 0-conf TX.

With lightning, if a merchant's node is DOS attacked or offline, then their funds become highly vulnerable to defaulting the smart contract.

Also, the cost to flip 1BTC to LTC via an exchange is almost $100 each time. Include that into your TX costs. The problem is stubborn Core people using band-aid solutions and in denial of the real problems.

the notion of centralised nodes onchain is not a problem, they don't have incentive to corrupt when they are onchain. It's not like there will be only a handful of nodes. The nodes won't even matter, it will just be miners. They are the only ones that can really protect the network.

let's say I use a special blackhat version of LN wallet which allows me to send from the address to another address first before replaying the LN tx with the same address. The LN transactions gets validated off chain and merchant gives you product/service. Onchain TX to myself gets validated onchain first and when the LN Tx hits the chain much later, it is considered invalid by concensus as the TX to myself precedes it.
Furthermore,what if I open independent payment channels using the same address and just keep those channels open. Because it's all offchain and not secured by concensus, all the independent smart contracts are privately validated and I get to multispend the same address.
This means receivers have to trust sending parties not to abuse offchain replay vulnerabilities.

Absolute garbage. 1mb blocks is asking the whole world of 2nd layer consolidations to settle thru a handful of onchainn transactions per second. The nash equilibrium of the off chain game will be commercial exchanges for your transactions much like an ISP.
Game theory suggests that to avoid being ripped off by double spending senders, the goal is to get the transaction settled on the chain soonest and thus you will be back to the same problem where every transaction needs timely settlement on chain and outsourcing it to 3rd party consolidators is not desirable.
You don't own the bitcoin until it settles onchain.
sidechains are just fragmented virtualisations of mempool and cannot scale with security of the blockchain.
P2P confirmations mean nothing, so if you want to confirm your transaction, you will end up pushing it onchain and we are back to the same scaling issues with small blocks.

Only other miners can invalidate miners from increasing the payout or any other type of rule breaking. What you verify as a non-mining node is disregarded.

Yes. remember that the golden rule of the chain is concensus and longest chain. So if you were to pay for a pizza and the pizza shop used a fast LN network which ends up being slower than direct to blockchain TX then what the sender can do is send the bitcoins to themself a few minutes before sending from the same address to the pizza shop. Pizza shop confirms via LN, great its confirmed (off chain). meanwhile seller's direct to chain gets thru first onchain and gets included in longest chain concensus and the pizza shop's transaction loses by concensus because it was parked in the sidechain and confirmed second.

So it is not just $0.28, that is misleading.
In order for lightning to actually reduce fees, a 2nd layer economy of regional banking has to consolidate transactions to remove the need to settle onchain. If you need to send transactions outside the region then it will be like sending money overseas with the fees.

so we have 160bn market cap for xCoin
I push the price of 1 coin up by $10 on an exchange by making an order for 0.001 Coin at $8010
Instead of throwing a $10 premium, because I've only traded 0.1% of a coin, I've only thrown in a $0.01 premium.
Market cap at $8010 is now 160.2bn.
I've just increased market cap by 200million by pumping it using 1c premium.

he is of the idea that optimisation means deleting transaction data, fragmentation of TX data, isolation of TX data, and unconfirming and unpublished TX data so that security is in the hands of the individual instead of decentralised security the ole fashion Bitcoin way.

why would miners want to mine segwit transactions to open and close LN channels if it competes with their economic incentives onchain? The macroeconomics of LN does not work for miners and it is trying to reward nodes that can lock up large funds and open the most channels to facilitate routing.

segwit doesn't compress the data. it actually uses more disk space and bandwidth than a non-segwit transaction.

we delete the data, we isolate the security to individual nodes, we avoid confirmations and we don't publish the TX data. Great scaling solution guys!
