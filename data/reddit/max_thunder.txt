Growth is linear therefore there will be 78.125M nodes in 8 weeks. Noiiiice.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:05:30


I don't, but as I've shown in another [post]( and using this [graph]( Bitcoin's growth was actually much slower in 2017 than it has been in its early years. Isn't fast growth that slows down over time more a marker of a disruptive technology than of bubbles? Granted, we don't have a lot of data, but you have to wonder if growth will simply taper down as opposed to completely crash.
edit: And many definitions of a bubble requires a contraction. What's a contraction for Bitcoin? Going down to $1000, to $100, to $1, to 5 cents? The bubble has been going on for 9 years, is it an 18-year bubble if it lasts another 9 then crash to $1?
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:54:45
What makes a bubble a bubble if it can never pop?
Either way, as I said, Bitcoin's bubble or not-bubble is extraordinary. Its growth has been mostly constant over the long term when you look at the last 7 years, with the current "correction" barely registering:  People often forget about that because they barely heard about Bitcoin before last year, yet its growth was actually incredibly much faster between 2011 and 2014.
It doesn't compare at all to the patterns observed for the dotcom bubble, which was extremely short lived in comparison, and which growth accelerated before the crash, rather than slowing down dramatically:  The tulipmania didn't even last a year.
Hence if it's a bubble, it's definitely one of its kind.
edit: Now if we go by this definition of bubble, "A bubble is an economic cycle characterized by rapid escalation of asset prices followed by a contraction.", then we have to base ourselves on something to determine what a rapid escalation is. Perhaps cryptocurrencies are creating a new paradigm, and current's growth isn't fast by comparison to how fast it has been in the past. If we call the current growth "rapid", then we have to call the whole growth a rapid escalation of prices, and a contraction would mean Bitcoin going back to sub-dollar levels.

mortgage /=/real estate
If you have a fixed mortgage at 2.5%, then paying it down is a 100% guaranteed return of 2.5%. The price of real estate has no influence.
I'm in Canada so the mortgage interests aren't tax deductible, so it's the equivalent of a tax-free 2.5% rate, which pretty much beats saving accounts, bonds and GICs.

There are 100 million satoshis per BTC. If the supply is so limited that it comes down to trading 10 satoshis for hundreds of dollars, then there would still be dips where 10 satoshis trade for much less and rallies where it starts trading for more. Limiting the supply would do nothing except increase the scarcity, but as others said, holding does the same.

You're free to do whatever you want. Free to never take any risk. If you have a student loan of 20k that you're paying, I dunno, $500 at a time, and you decide to invest an extra $500 in Ethereum or Doge (I don't give a shit about Bitcoin, everyone should diversify), and I don't think there's anything crazy about that.
One thing is sure, I'm not going to sell my index funds to pay down my mortgage just because "debt is bad". There is a risk involved, but over the long-term, risks tend to give bigger rewards.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:55:23
Nobody knows where it will go. The longer Bitcoin has been around, the more people will be willing to pay for it. The perception of risk will go down with time, so people will be more and more willing to put money into it, until it reaches a point of equilibrium once the perception of risk has stabilized. I actually see the potential for gains to be accelerating even more, and we'll see major crashes followed by recoveries. If this keeps going for 5 years, or 10 years, will people think it's still a bubble? Can a bubble really last 20 years? We'll see.
I think Bitcoin will always be more volatile than something like gold, it's inherent to the type of market, how liquid Bitcoin is compared to gold. You can sell and buy back rapidly on an exchange, then sell again and buy something else, then sell again and buy Bitcoin. It's a bit like comparing the returns of real-estate investment trusts (REITs) to buying real estate, REITs appear much more volatile thanks to being traded on the stock market, even when comparing similar assets (e.g. apartment buildings).

I was saying that jokingly. If you read the early retirement sub you'll want to retire well before you are 55, especially if you have that kind of money! People on are retiring with 1M and some with even less.
Comes down to a choice, e.g. retiring in a very good financial situation at 45, retiring rich at 55, retire wealthy at 65, etc. Of course you need a good starting position and good career to achieve these kinds of goals, for some, retiring in a very good financial situation at 65 is the dream. Perhaps crypto will make even earlier retirements possible...

Ever heard of compounding interests? Put that 20k a year in the stock market. Of course saving it in cash makes no fucking sense. If you invested 20k 30 years ago, it'd be like 265k today. However 20k 30 years ago was one hell of a sum.
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:59:14
How to have 4M:
-Get a good career.  
-Don't read the early retirement subs.  
-Work for 30 years while saving a substantial amount of your income while invest said savings into stocks (my suggestion would be US and International index ETFs from Vanguard).  
-You are rich.
It's a lot easier to be rich at 55 than it is at 25.

That's true in Canada (my guess as to where you're from) but isn't in the US. 
Here's a breakdown of a US all stocks ETF.
Basic Materials	2.70%  
Consumer Goods	8.90%  
Consumer Services	12.30%  
Financials	20.50%  (*this is 35% in Canada*)  
Health Care	12.80%  
Industrials	13.30%  
Oil &amp; Gas	5.50%  
Technology	19.00%  
Telecommunications	1.80%  
Utilities	3.20%  
  I'm Canadian and I do think that the banks are facing new risks (plus our well overpriced real estate market), so most of my money is invested in the rest of the world. If cryptos are the future, then whatever I have there will be enough to live on anyway.
  Stocks aren't going away anytime soon; if fiat currencies lost value, then stocks' price would jump up accordingly (unless it's a scenario where the capitalist economy is permanently in shambles). When you own a share you don't own currency anymore (except for the actual cash the company has).

Coinbase doesn't support selling in Canada too... We have another exchange, but that other exchange doesn't take credit cards. So I buy on Coinbase, move to my personal wallet, and when I'll need to sell, at least I know I have that other exchange... But the lack of exchanges make me feel a bit trapped. I could try getting a US chequing accounts though, some of our banks do business in the US. The issue might then be getting access to USD exchanges.
  Imagine if you could just sell your BTC for whichever currency and then spend that currency (when travelling for instance). It could compete with the shitty exchange rates of banks and credit cards fees (although in Canada we have like 2 credit cards with no foreign currency fees, but that might not last).

Isn't that what has been happening for quite a while now? Bitcoin's growth has been ridiculously fast this in the last months.
  There's a lot of fear regarding putting money in Bitcoin, there's a perception that it's very risky, plus it's relatively complicated (vs buying stocks and mutual funds from your good old brokerage/bank; the average schmuck doesn't even invest, or invest in bank-recommended high-fee mutual funds). So it can only grow so fast. Myself, I'm still not fully confident there can't be something fucked, with all the upcoming forks, and all the exchanges doing shady things. It's also weird there aren't more exchanges while they seem like money-printing machines.

  There will never be enough money in crypto for everyone to retire, at some point returns will slow down, if it doesn't crash.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:51:50
Correct me if I'm wrong but there are only 113 wallets with a balance of 10,000 to 100,000 BTC, and even 100,000 BTC at $100,000 is *only* 10 billion. So we're not talking trillionaires here. Satoshi could be *the* trillionaire, but we don't know who it is, if it's only one person, etc.
  Many of these wallets are probably in fact exchanges and are therefore held by a lot of people, and many are probably from the early days and completely lost.
  However, under the assumption that everybody has a price, I'm sure people won't hold forever. At some point, it's tempting to cash in and live a little. I think that this is why Bitcoin tends to crash a bit after reaching new ATH. This time it is a bit different given how fast it rises, it is tempting to hold. But I think that if the price plateaus a little, there will be many people selling and the price will crash a bit. It's hard to predict when it starts, but it starts, many people follow.
  Also, any "trillionaire" trying to offload their BTC (let's say BTC hit 10M, so that 100,000 BTC is worth 1 trillion) would quickly make the value go down... So if they really want to sell all their BTC, then they're more likely to be multibillionaires than trillionaires.
  I'd be curious to see historical data of wallet sizes, to see how many people resisted selling any BTC. There might also be a correlation between the crashes of July and September and the number of bigger wallets getting down.
  Stock markets probably see the same phenomenon, with early investors selling at some point, and affecting the overall price. Normally, an investor will only divest a little at a time. That is what Bill Gates has been doing with Microsoft for instance. There's no benefit for the investor to crash the price, other than perhaps try to provoke a crash at which point they buy again and initiate a rally (at the risk of the price going down further).

Gold isn't that scarce, the amount mined has been growing exponentially. Its high demand as a store of value keeps its price up abd make it highly profitable to mine. Is it really that good of a store of value if we suddenly found a huge amount of gold somewhere?
Silver is scarce and has other uses, platinum I'd scarce and has other uses, pretty much all elements have some scarcity and some uses. Bitcoin is scarce and also have other uses, but at least its scarcity is programmed to never change.
What keeps gold price down is the fact that mining increases as its price increases. Bitcoin lacks such a mechanism, for the better or the worse.

And people totally misunderstand what a market cap is. 
  It doesn't take a billion dollar to make Bitcoin's market cap go up by a billion dollar. It only takes several people agreeing to buy Bitcoin at $70 more.
edit: The entire world's stock market is currently about the same size as the entire's world GDP. Bitcoin is different since there's no underlying asset to drive the value, and nothing keeping people from buying 1 thounsandth of a BTC at $10, or 1 millionth of a BTC at $10, and so on, for as long as there is an expectation of profit, or a usage. The Canadian dollar for instance has decreased in value to the point where the penny is useless. If the CAD was deflationary, then we'd have to introduce half pennies and so on; there doesn't have to be a limit to how deflationary it can be based on the world's GDP, since it is not related. 
BTC is different in that it already has 1/100,000,000th of a bitcoin, but it also does not have the capacity to produce a half satoshi. However, we're already at a point where 100 satoshis are 1 penny.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:58:45


If Bitcoin became nothing more than a protection against inflation, rising 3% per year, it would still be a solid investment, especially nowadays that interest rates are so low. It doesn't matter whether you get 1 satoshi or 1 bitcoin when you invest your $5000. All you care about is the 3%. And I think that's why will keep rising and rising, from the investor's point of view, it's only about the growth.
   And as a currency, it's only about the value being stable, I don't care if I'm buying a car and it's worth 1 satoshi or 100 Bitcoins, if a car is worth say 500 hours of work, all that matters is that whatever I'm paid in BTC for those 500 hours will be enough to buy that car.

I think one big challenge to see the real impact of inflation on wages is women entering the workforce. My parents bought their house on one income, now you need two incomes to buy a decent house in most areas because most couples have two incomes anyway. It uses the be a huge advantage financially to have a partner who is working, now it's the norm. Hence prices were driven up, especially real estate it seems.
Where I am in Canada there are a lot of unions and unionized employees usually get at least inflation, all government workers get inflation, and the minimal wage is regularly increased to meet inflation.

Or had you invested in the stock market that $20 in 1998, you'd now have about $100.
  Bitcoin is still far ahead, but inflation isn't the enemy if you're savvy with your money. However, over the long term, I do see cryptocurrencies as a more risky saving account or bond that is even less correlated with the markets (good thing) and that protects you against inflation.
  Also, imagine if you borrowed Bitcoins to buy your house in 2014 and had a 200 BTC mortgage. Could you imagine trying to pay it today? With inflation and current mortgage interest rates, it's almost free to borrow money to buy a house. I guess all this means is that either debt in BTC doesn't make sense, and/or that it would require mass adoption of BTC so that debt is viable; companies would be quick to lower BTC salaries when its value goes up, and would do so faster than they raise salaries when inflation goes up, so it's more efficient in that aspect.

Looks like a Vertcoin ad.

Your post is similar to what I was expressing at a similar time last year. I spent a lot of time last year thinking about what gives a price to something without intrinsic value. The closest to cryptocurrencies are collectibles, which usually only attract a small part of the population, and have an extremely low liquidity that makes them a lot less attractive, and they tend to be trends that die. Cryptocurrencies don't seem to be something that die due to their global nature, their development, and a host of other factors.
I do agree with the main limiting factor, in terms of price, is the world's population.
I also think the growth (upwards or downwards) is proportional to its liquidity. That's why there's a lot of potential for another bull run; as soon as it starts growing upwards and there's some momentum, greed becomes contagious, a lot of new users come in (and this time, they may think they don't want to miss the bull run like last time, and a lot of people will also have forgotten about cryptos), and there we go to new highs.
I haven't been around for long enough to watch what happens after every cycle, but even Google Trends (looking for "Bitcoin") shows a cyclical pattern that's pretty clear. And people are losing interest in cryptocurrencies and it's an amazing sign that we're near the bottom of the last cycle, so history repeating itself wouldn't surprise me at all.
The media attention that surrounded the last cycle makes me think that the next one could be the last, but it could be a really big one. Don't get too greedy, folks. And it may also never happen.
