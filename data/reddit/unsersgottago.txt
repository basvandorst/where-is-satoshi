Gov is on your (US) back in part because of Turbotax. Filing taxes could be free and simple, but Intuit spends millions to ensure the US tax code stays complicated, and filing is difficult.   
When you patronize Turbotax, H&amp;R block, you are also contributing to a multi million dollar warchest to lobby against legislation to create a straightforward tax code and offer pre-filled, free-file returns.  the business model is a rent-seeking behaviour.

yes.  i originally tried to popularize bitcoin when i found out about it.  i got one person interested and that was about it.
6 years later and i now tell NOBODY about bitcoin.  i don't want to be a target of ridicule or a home invasion.  Time has has made btc bolder, and i'm getting older too.
The way i saw it before was i had to get my friends and family at least aware of bitcoin, and for them to make up their own mind.  However, i realize that will just happen naturally as adoption occurs.  I won't hold for them; i let them choose their own paths.
The way i see it now is hide my btc under a bushel until the world catches up.  I realize nothing i can do is going to speed up adoption, and it's just going to cause me more hassle IRL.  If BTC is a bigger thing in the future than it is now, i now feel that difficult discussions like these will work themselves out.  e.g. i don't have to convince my dad the benefits of a smartphone - in 2009 he was scared of them, but in 2019 he just buys and uses them and it's nbd.
I encourage you to look for a btc kindred spirit, rather than try to recruit the whole family.  I would also treat btc as money, and not fucking talk about money with everyone e.g. you don't measure paycheques with strangers, you don't update people about your daily retirement savings  portfolio fluctuations.  If you have to talk about bitcoin, see if you can do it without ever mentioning its current price, or the word 'fiat'.
However, the one person i talked to bitcoin about way back when i was starting out still has his bitcoin, and we still keep in touch.  In this case, we knew each other before a lot of this BTC growth happened, and we still talk about it like it's a curiosity or hobby, rather than an investment strategy.   I know conversations like that are rare, especially in this subreddit.

if a contentious fork can survive two changes in difficulty under their new consensus rules, then it will be impossible to get rid of that new blockchain. The nakomoto whitepaper shows both blockchains will have too much history for an attack to rewrite. the fork is "successful" because it has successfully diverged from the BTC blockchain and can no longer interoperate with it - it has its own blockchain and own future.  
That doesn't mean a "successful" fork cannot be attacked, forked again (e.g. BCH-&gt;BSV and BCHABC) but because the blockchain is immutable, it will persist.

imo there are a few upcoming points of interest for hashrate:
- at some point in the near future, the ramp-up in difficulty will cause more S9 (16nm process) generation miners to shut down.  soon S9 will be mineable only with free power.
- However, mining models change if BTC becomes more profitable, and will keep old miners going for longer.  an S9 may be profitable when BTC is at $15k, but not at $10k.
- some of the increase in hashrate is in anticipation the fourth block reward halving.  imo part of the hashrate increase now, pre-halving, is the people with higher electricity costs looking to ROI over the next few months and shut their miners down in may.
- Trump trade war tariffs cut directly into miners' profits in the USA only, and hurts small-scale miners  the most.  this probably will have an impact on many US operations in the short term.
- If some of this hashrate increase is becuase of more efficient chips what is next after 7nm chips?  Bitmain claims the 7nm BM1397 can get to 30J/TH efficiency (S17e is listed at 42J/TH), but i wonder if Moore's law will still hold for the next generation of asics.
@_date: 2019-09-04 17:09:26
This article doesn't even mention what will happen to the global hashrate when the S9 becomes unprofitable to run at 3.5¢/KWH.  that's about 30-40% of hashrate that will need to find cheaper power than China has in the summer season.

Nassim Nicholas Taleb rails on TA in "Fooled by Randomness".   The book discusses how human brains are excellent pattern-recognizing devices, and will see patterns where none exists.  Taleb also points out the inherent survivorship bias in TA discussions - someone claims it works (anecdotally), because they know how to do TA.  the ones that TA doesn't work for, must not know how to perform TA.  These "losers" are excluded from the TA camp, because they must have done their TA wrong.
People also confuse making money, with making a smart financial decision.  Someone can make money throwing dice, but that doesn't mean that financial model is sustainable. Taleb points out "skewed distributions":  situations where the odds are not intuitive.  Black swan events like crashes are counter-intuitive events where it is hard to determine the likelihood it would occur, and when.  Taleb states: "Option sellers, it is said, eat like chickens and go to the bathroom like elephants" i.e. investors may may gain small, consistent amounts on speculative ritual, then lose a fortune during disaster event.

If selling a car i would use bitcoin less for speculation, and more because bitcoin transactions are more secure.  i'm sure lots of people will give you rosy stories about going to the moon ITT, but there are pragmatic reasons for choosing bitcoin for certain types of transactions.
e.g. i can meet a buyer after work (i.e. after banks closed), on a holiday, on a long weekend at Taco Cabeza.  They transfer the 10,000 for my shitbox while we have some tacos.  when 6 confirmations occur on the network, i slide over the keys and the title, and we go our separate ways.
i would much rather do this than accepting an envelope with $10,000 in cash and then try to deposit it before i get robbed.  If i was getting US funny money, i'd want to look at each bill to make sure there weren't counterfeits, but that is tacky to do in a restaurant, and i don't know how to tell real from counterfeit money. 
If the purchaser brought a bank draft, i'd have to wait for a bank to open to confirm and deposit. With a Bitcoin transaction i do not have to trust the person, only the bitcoin network.  No expertise is needed - anybody can download a bitcoin wallet to confirm the transaction is real, and the bitcoin is real.  The bitcoin network also confirms a transaction irreversibly, unlike paypal, etransfer, interac, etc.  I can re-transfer the bitcoin offsite before i even leave the restaurant, knowing the funds are genuine and safe.  Unlike the bank draft or an envelope of cash, if my phone gets lost or robbed i can reconstitute the bitcoin wallet with a seed phrase i previously stored in a safe place.
IMO, i would use bitcoin for these types of transactions because it is safer and more secure than existing, traditional methods of transferring money.

Do you know what is your electricity price is?  
if you can get electricity for ~3.5 dinara per kilowatt hour (KWh), it may be possible to mine small amounts and make a profit.  
What is your budget? you will need specialized hardware to mine bitcoin ~35,000 dinara to start.  you will need a safe place with your cheap electricity to house the miner, and let it run for weeks and months to accumulate small fractions of a bitcoin.  
I also would not risk any money on this project than you can afford to lose.  there are a lot of ways to lose money mining, but it helps if you have the right budget and cheap electricity.

What the fuck are you talking about?  i don't think poolin cares; like most mining pools they are only mining the coin becuase it happens to be more profitable for that time period.  They are probably just autoexchanging and paying out in BTC.


While we know the rate of issuance will go down, the value of one BTC may still make it worthwhile to mine, and we do not know the value of BTC by 2032.  
Back in 2012 when block rewards were 50btc, it would be unthinkable to mine when rewards are 12.5btc.  but the present value justifies allocating increasing resources to continue mining at the current, reduced rate of issuance.

@_date: 2019-09-06 22:24:11
this is my 'intriguing btc tweet of the week' in that it made me rethink my assumptions about the immutability of a certain block, and the incentive for attack.  
The whitepaper states as blocks get added, the probability of a successful attack drops exponentially, so the earlier an attack can begin, the higher the chance of success.  Someone would have to be coordinated enough to corral 51% of 88EH on short notice.  Every single block that passes reduces the chances of an attack being successful, and the short chain miners (i.e. unsuccessful attackers) would lose all the block reward for mining the wrong chain.  A miner who considered a bribe to attack the blockchain would expect to be paid a share of block rewards if the effort fail, or take a loss on the electricity and mining time.
An attacker would also have to incorporate a probable drop in the price of BTC - $1B before a demonstrated successful 51% attack of such scale hobbled confidence in the technology.  Lots of low-information BTC investors that wouldn't understand, and gtfo.  A post-attack BTC price may be difficult to anticipate.
IMO this is definitely an point of vulnerability, and using multiple smaller tx over time would help spread out the risk.  But i wonder if the likelihood of a successful 51% attack on BTC would be at this point in time. further distribution of miners would make it more difficult too coordinate enough resources, but i also wonder if in 2019 the miners are distributed enough.
@_date: 2019-09-08 06:02:57
100 is fine, but trezor will slow down with enough transactions over time becuase it has to download the entire transaction history. 
they suggest using a desktop or mobile wallet for receiving frequent transactions (e.g. mining income) or transactions with more inputs (e.g. coinbase) becuase you would have more brainpower on those platforms.
they also recommend using passphrases to generate an unlimited number of wallets to transact on the same trezor, which relieves the need to for the trezor to process unrelated, previous transactions in the other wallets.

at 15, your main advantage is time.  However, you need to understand how to evaluate risk in investments.  
i would encourage you to do a lot of reading, and finding mentors who manage their money wisely with goals and long term planning.  if you invest in this education first, before you invest real money, you will be far ahead of most people your age.
as for the percentage of your paycheck to save, i would save at least 10%, in a bank account. However, I would only put what you could afford to lose into bitcoin.  it is too volatile for the short term, so the majority of your savings should still be in stable money for the time being.  
the volatility of bitcoin is like the deep end of speculation; imo it should not be your only means of savings, but as part of a larger, diverse pile of savings.

bitcoin.org has wallet comparisons for a handful of good wallets:
@_date: 2019-09-10 02:26:42
i recommend ColdTI - i bought a couple for $20, and it's titanium, not steel or aluminum.  it comes with two places that bolt together, and there is tamper evident stickers so you know if it's been opened or not.
imo compared to coldTI, cryptosteel is overpriced and fussy.  it shouldn't cost $60 to keep seedwords safe.
@_date: 2019-09-05 20:20:37


imo there are different types of threats, because any wallet exists in the context of the user, and the user's risks.
e.g. a user who brags about their crypto and has bitcoin stickers on their cars and laptops may be at a higher risk category than someone who hodls but quietly.  
With regards to trust vs. verify, this also depends on the user's ability as well as the trust in the vendor.  Despite using the Verify mantra, i am guessing the number of people that can audit and compile code are even smaller than the number of people that verify a download.  you can pick an open source firmware, but would you have to be able to ID a malicious payload yourself.
Also, consider Trust vs. verify on the hardware itself - typically, the security chips themselves are not open source. (also afaik trezor does not use a secure element)  Coldcard MK1/MK2 use the ATECC508A as a Secure Element, and the mfg have released a datasheet for it here:
(note - the MK3 uses a different chip, also made by Microchip, that the mfg. did not release a data sheet)


fwiw, Trezor, ledger and coinkite(coldcard) technicians appear to have software-defined radios on their desks specifically looking for side channel attacks, Trezor also has addressed side channel attacks both in the firmware update for Trezor One and in the choice of LCD for model T. 
i'd also want to point out the coldcard also addresses physical attacks in a unique way - their clear case is welded together, and it becomes obvious if the wallet has been physically altered.  their power LED is actually a CONFIRM/WARN LED, which is is controlled by a physically separate circuit, and will light up if the bootup firmware matches the checksum in the ROM. you can see through the case next to the display if that checksum circuit has been modified. there are lots of small design decisions in coldcard that address physical attacks in ways no other mfg. currently does.
imo security is best approached holistically, and to balance the likelihood of a physical attack vs. remote, a technical attack vs. social engineering, and losing the wallet vs. getting hit on the head and forgetting the PIN/passphrase.  "help i forgot my pin" continues to be a frequent topic on all hardware wallets.

i am guessing there will be no reduction in tariffs before the 2020 elections, so the small scale miner will be hit hardest. IMO miners in the US should figure if their projections for future difficulty and ROI can pay 27.6% more.

Here's a $20 ColdTI vs. torch test
anything similar for cryptosteel?

check out the PiTrezor Project:  it uses the open source firmware of a commercial, hardware wallet and the hardware of a bog standard raspberry pi.  support for an OLED screen (e.g. adafruit bonnet) included:
just remember the one big caveat about security:


so imo this would be good if you had small amounts only.  The raspberry pi's storage is removable, so anybody with an SD card reader would be able to read your seed words and steal your precious pigs.

Does localcoin ATM support lightning network transactions?

if a mining pool is going for 1mb blocks on BCH, they are clearly not supporting BCH for the long term, but only mining it for slightly higher payouts.  many pools offer auto-switch to most profitable coin, and auto-exchange to BTC.  
e.g. P2Pool occasionally shows BCH being slightly ahead of BTC, BSV, but other times BSV will be mined over BTC.  they still pay out in BTC.  this changes every times in a day, and it could easily swing permanently in BTC's favour.  BCH halving its block reward could be such a catalyst.

The first S9s were available for order June, 2016. They have been mining profitably on SHA-256 for at least 3 years now.  
The S9 was the first 16nm miner that shipped and they replaced 28nm process miners (e.g. avalon 6, M3, S5, S7).  a single S9 consumed 1375W and replaced four miners that consumed 4400W.  When the S9 was released it blew everything away.  it's only now in 2019, after S9's have reached ROI multiple times, do they seem like electricity hogs.

if you send it back to the existing wallet, you've just relinked your coins back to your old wallet address.
send it to a new wallet.

FYI Interac E-Transfer has also been used in recent fraud on localbitcoins:  
tl;dr when using e-transfer use the standard precautions whenever dealing with banks.

So when will this occur exactly?  i agree with you on some of generalities, but those sentiments don't cover all possibilities, or even the most likely scenario.  Worst case is not always the most likely case, even though they may point in the same direction.
imo in a recession, people are less likely to engage in speculation.  and regardless of our positive long term outlook on bitcoin, we can at least admit some of its current value is based on speculation.

Not all miners sell immediately though.  Every miner may have different strategies/hopium to reach ROI

i can agree with this, but i don't think that "everyone" will lose faith in fiat within our lifetimes.
otoh, i do not agree that this is going to happen in the near term.  i think we will have a global recession.  With regards to the Fed, they were unable to control Germany's recession, which started in January 2019.  Other countries already are also in recession, or will go into recession in the next year.

have you tried hodling it

looking at BTC block rewards over the first 8 years in, block reward was 12.5BTC, which 1/4 of what it was initially, not 1/10.  Double check whether your decay model is accurate.
And 8 years in, BTC is still profitable enough to mine.  That's already been proven from 2009-present.  That cannot be said for BCH.
