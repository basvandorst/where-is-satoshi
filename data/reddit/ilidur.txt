Splitting the article into a lot of pages, calling it "Slideshow" and getting paid for each ad/page? Fuck them..

Most android devices have cameras, very few have NFC.

If people are interested in this they should fork to another sub/r/ and link it in the side bar

Section 7 of the TOS :










No county, no country no nothing!
I don't have the motivation to look closely, but there's no address in any of the terms, not even the bloody country they are in!
I call scam! Bah! Humbug! 
**EDIT: Scam was a bit harsh. It's a starting business so it should have some hiccups at the beginning regarding it's presentation info.  As I said 2 comments deep:**
**If you're going to start an online business with an untraceable and nonrefundable currency without any way of physically proving you exist, you should expect some scepticism.**

I find it hilarious because the more people talk about it going down the more it will go down.

So that means I can start cpu mining? :)

I was really looking for an address to know how long things would ship &amp; stuff like that...  because you didn't have your address easily verifiable(whois information doesn't fall into that category), I basically said to myself "something is fishy". Maybe scam was a harsh word but expecting people send money for a 500BTC projector without knowing where the thing is shipped from raises big questions.
 I really tried looking for an about page or something but nothing came up. I went for the TOS and while skimming it I saw the note at the end with "Generated by [lawyer company]'s software" ... Second thing that popped out was the fact that the phone basically sounds like one of those movie fillers. So I assumed "well, a scammer might put up a fake website and added some filler text".  
One thing i know about scammers is that they have awesomely looking websites and your's was one of them!(awesome that is).
If you're going to start an online business with an untraceable and nonrefundable currency without any way of physically proving you exist, you should expect some scepticism.

Even if you may be right, I call bull on your metodology. To have a moment of insight is not to understand. 
Any paralel currency development comparrison? Not in this one.

Yeah, sorry, that's what I meant.

for android you have Bitcoin Wallet, an open source project that's looking promising. it hasn't gone through rigorous testing but I had a go and it worked well.

 head on there to skip installing software, then go to step 3 from what freebullets said

Let's just hope Ron Paul gets that bill passed. (ducks)

It's a really good read for anyone interested in using bitcoins as a stable currency. There's also a tr;dt down the page.

Intersango has debit card deposit, or it does for GBP. Bitmarket does verify you even if you don't have any history, just send them an email asking nicely. They removed paypal from transactions so it's now fully safe.
