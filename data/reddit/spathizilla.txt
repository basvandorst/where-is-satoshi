~~Denied. Maybe later tonight in 6 hours or so.~~ Briefly... 
I'll be this excited when we break $1163 on Bitstamp since thats the ATH (and was also my trade - I sold :D)

Yeh but then the m in mBTC will mock me!

I was so happy when I got my first 0.01BTC..
Still not got to 1BTC yet though :(

Confirming this is incorrect. I bought some SLL via Paypal and immediately converted to BTC then told it to withdraw to my Bitcoin address. 
Took 48 hours as I was a new account and got shafted on fees but it was possible. Overall I think the fees are less on btcquick compared to Virwox as you're only paying the 7.5% cc fee on btcquick

I think this site is a really good idea. It goes a long way to explaining what Bitcoin is in terms most people will understand. 
While I've known about BTC for a long time, I never jumped through the hoops to get any. Sucks as I first came across BTC when the price was sub $10. The thing I always found annoying was finding a way to get BTC from the UK without paying horrible amounts of transaction fees.
Well at least now I have my first 0.0004 btc :D

So THIS is why I've had to rebuild the block database like 3 times already today. Damn that kernel reboot I did earlier for causing so many problems. 
Not that I need immediate access to the 0.02 bitcoins I have lol

Private I would think is better. I guess you can leave the public feature in there for if someone really wants to show off.

Well, how the fed works and prints money is "complicated" and we definitely know that criminals and terrorists alike love them some USD.... 
I'm concerned about this USD thing.

Loving the green transparent plastic look. I think it makes it better than some other boring opaque plastic case.

Wouldn't it be better to handle balance information in a direct message on twitter? I'm sure some people might not like the idea of their balance being in your twitter feed. 
Also might want to only post a verification tweet when it is requested. You'll quickly eat the twitter api limits otherwise if/when you get popular.

*shakes fist* 
How could you remind me of this?! Such a cruel world!

I'm just thinking about how the tip bot on here works for a rough guideline of how a twitter one could work. 
Perhaps only tweet confirmations of sending when requested. As for balances, I guess it doesn't *really* matter they're in the public, after all it is in the blockchain.

I want one, but given my current btc holdings stands at a very impressive (I wish) 0.6btc, I probably don't *need* it.

I've often seen people mention how it is hard to get USD out of Gox. However, I wondered how anyone continues to trust them if they are having a very hard time paying out the fiat to their customers. 
So, my question is does the problems Gox has with USD also extend to other currencies (like the euro or gbp)? 
In other words if I sold BTC on Gox and actually wanted Euros, would they have no problem with that transfer or would it be impacted by the same crap that USD is?
