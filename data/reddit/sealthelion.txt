They'll sky rocket in 2058 to $10 million a coin and I'll be shitting myself wondering why I never transferred my BTC over to my eyePhone2020.

Yeah, I only got in last year, but I look at what my holding is worth maybe once a week. Don't see why it's so stressful for everyone, it's not like any of us HODLers were gonna sell it anytime soon anyways.

Well I plan on holding til I die lol, I'm in this bitch for life. My grandkids are gonna be trillionaires.

And then I won't have as much as I have now. We used to use it to buy drugs back in college, but at its current price, those transactions were like thousands for an ounce of weed, lol. 
Not making that mistake again, I'm never selling lol.

Mind me asking how difficult it was to install your own solar? I've got a fairly limited knowledge of electrical systems, but i do have a lil bit to work with.

Word, that's cool. I work in manufacturing and have done some electrical work, so I'd like to think I could figure it out with patience.

Yeah, I don't even remember where this comment chain started lol. I'm just being picky.

Ahh, I see. I've got mine in a wallet saved directly to my laptop's harddrive. Dog spilled water over it last week and I about shit myself since I hadn't backed up my computer in a stupidly long time (over a year). It survived though, thank the lord.

But the second part of the statement is essentially a continuation of the first part; semi-colons are used in such cases. 
Colons would be used in the following cases: [I'm lazy, so I'll let you fill in these brackets with examples even though the example is obviously what precedes the brackets].

Lol I had no idea that was a quote tbh. Was it used as such in this context? If so, then we probably just look like two dummies forming arguments on the basis of totally different contexts hahaha.
@_date: 2019-04-17 18:33:45
Definitely a semi-colon, not a colon.
@_date: 2019-04-17 20:27:13
I mean, you don't have to take my word for it as I am none of those things lol, but I see no reason why a colon would fit into the spot you slipped it in that first comment. Just doesn't work in that context, unless there's some obsolete use of a colon that I was unaware of.
