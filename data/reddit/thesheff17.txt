I ordered twice from them before with no issues.  Now he refuses to answer any emails and ignores contact through IRC.  All I'm doing is hopefully warning the community about his SCAM.  If there is a better place to notify people about this SCAM let me know.

I agree I can be found on IRC all the time under the same username.  Please contact me through reddit or IRC.  At this point I'm just trying to warn everyone.

I finally received my order just this week.  The owner on the site said he would ship something extra in order to make up for the delays but didn't get anything.  At this point I'm just happy to have something in hand and will switch to another metals provider.  Hopefully people read these posts before ordering from them.

what is AML?  Can you give me more information about this?

I also purchased from them before.  Then I made this purchase which was one of the biggest orders.  I wonder if he full fills all small orders and then just scams people out of the bigger ones.

Why does it make me look bad?  I have used them twice before and had no issues.  I been around the btc community for years and I didn't know about this issue until after the last order was placed.  Now he refuses to answer any emails or IRC chats.  This post is more just a warning to new customer stumbling across his site.  At this point I consider my 18btc a lost cause and another scam plagues the btc community.

at this point I would prefer anything.  Even a damn response would be nice.

Any update on on this.  He also stole 18btc from me.  Contact me if you need further information.
