That’s a lot of fancy prose, but...the only reason Bitcoin has any value is because people say that it does. That’s true of literally anything.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:03:18
Nonsense. If there’s no regulations, there’s nothing stopping me from hiring my own hit-squad to get my money back.
...of course, now that I think of it, the hit squad could then just kill me and run off with the money...
@_date: 2018-01-26 22:58:46
It’s honestly the same sort of “nothing can ever go wrong!” thinking that’s lead to most every financial crisis in history.

A fair point, but, consider this: gold's been valued highly for a lot longer than the tech sector's been using it.
And it's not like Iridium has zero uses. A lot of spark plugs use Iridium, because it's less prone to corrosion than any other metal and it's got a really high melting point.

TBF a 3% return like he’s got if he sells right now is pretty darn good for a three-month investment.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:29:49
Just use the NPR versions off Stormy Weathwr and We’re in the Money.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:36:07
Something rare only has value because people arbitrarily decide that it does. Iridium is considerably rarer than gold, but not worth as much. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 03:14:44
Look, I'm not saying gold is worthless. People saying gold is worthless are nutters who evidently don't realize people buy and sell gold. The very nature of economics dictates that, if people are willing to buy something, it literally cannot be worthless.
I'm just saying that its not valuable because it's rare. Gold's rarity doesn't give it is value. Oh, don't get me wrong, it helps, but there're plenty of rarer, harder-to-get substances that are less valuable than gold (hence the Iridium example).
Gold's value comes from the fact that people believe it has value. I mean, the rarity helps - people would probably think it has less value if you could just walk down the street and find some on the ground - but gold's rarity itself doesn't give it its value.

That's...that's an absolutely terrible idea.
Bitcoin is a lot of things, but a low/medium-risk-investment it is not. That's what people should put their retirements towards, with maybe a little toward high-risk stuff just in case they catch lightning in a bottle.
This just sounds like a great way for millennial to risk losing everything.
@_date: 2018-05-12 14:00:25
So what was gold backed by?
@_date: 2018-05-12 15:32:50
Yeah, but according to the article, over 20% of students investing in cryptocurrencies are using their financial aid money for it. And others are using it in their IRAs. Those aren't exactly sound investments.
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:01:41
To put this in perspective, all of the wealth held by individuals in the entire world totals to about $280 trillion. 40% of that is $112 trillion, meaning that for just 1000 people to hold it, each would have to have an average of $112 billion.
That is, of course, not true. Only one person - Jeff Bezos - has that much wealth. The world’s 1000th-richest person holds just 2% of that amount, at $2.4 billion.
@_date: 2018-05-14 17:42:06
When did you buy $100 worth of bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-05-12 23:14:58
It’s lost 40% of its value since January. And, yes, it’s gained 380% of its value since last May, but that level of volatility is the opposite of a low-risk investment.
@_date: 2018-10-28 14:07:16
Well, that's what you get when most people holding your 'currency of the future' view it as less of a currency and more of a get-rich quick scheme.
@_date: 2018-10-28 14:09:38
Except most people in bitcoin only got into bitcoin to make money "investing" it, not to actually use it as money.
@_date: 2018-10-28 14:08:54
Wouldn't inflation be the opposite?
@_date: 2018-06-27 14:05:52
That’s not inflation, though. Thats just supply and demand.
@_date: 2018-11-23 15:18:46


You...really don’t know how the stock market works, do you?
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:14:12
It’s always ended in hyperinflation because the only ways for a currency to end are:
* Every institution backing it collapses (which leads to hyperinflation).
* The currency undergoes hyperinflation to the point where it becomes unusable.
Thing is, though, most currencies haven’t failed. Its like saying “every democracy ends in conquest or collapse”. Technically true, but only because that’s the only way they can end.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:26:10
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:29:35
So...what, exactly, are these? Just some weird novelty for people who like bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:40:19
Technically speaking, that’s not a stock.

Banks - at least in the United States - don’t print money.
Okay, okay, *one* bank prints money - the Federal Reserve Bank. But the rest? Nope. And all those “little” banks - Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and the like - they’d all benefit massively from a deflationary currency.

The global GDP is somewhere around 60 Trillion USD...and we conduct transactions in terms of fractions of a cent. 2.1 Quadrillion of anything isn’t enough, long-term.

Do you not know what a metaphor is?

The DOW is down 400 on the day; that’s less than 2%.
Meanwhile, Bitcoin is down 1200 on the day. That’s over 14%.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:24:53
FTSE dropped 1.6%. Dow is down about 1.4%.
Bitcoin is down 14%.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:37:06
And Gold, now that I look again. But it didn’t rise by much.
@_date: 2018-11-19 23:10:26
Man, Santa ain’t got time for this.

Stock Broker, October 19, 1929: “Crash? What crash? Aren’t we up like 100 over last year or something?”
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:18:47
Because it’s a good thing to discuss?
I like the idea of crypto. I also think a lot of people here are morons who don’t understand the basics of economics.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:33:11


So, they have a cache of bitcoin equal to 1.5% of the US GDP, and this helps...how?
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:48:27
Still too high. A single gallon of milk costs about $3; that’s a good baseball price for a minimum transaction.
Discover, the credit card that charges the highest fee, takes 2%. So until the price of a transaction falls to 2% of $3 (6 cents), it really wont be viable. Hell, I’d take 60 cents at this point.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:21:44
More to the point...wouldn’t most banks *want* a deflationary currency like bitcoin?
Deflation favors those who hold money. And who holds the most money? The banks.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:56:49
Yeah, I made that post several hours before close. It plunged in the last hour.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:20:32
That’s a good point, actually. I had forgotten about the impact of deflation on loans.
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:23:43
Let’s say the DOW falls by 1000 points tomorrow. That would be an unprecedented, catastrophic loss, at least in terms of raw numbers (the biggest single-day drop in history was less than 800). It would probably end up leading to a recession. Investors might panic, and flee to more stable investments like gold and treasury bonds. The boom we’ve been experiencing since before the election would end, and the nation would be thrown into turmoil.
It would also be less than a 5% drop.
Bitcoin dropped over 13% *today*, from midnight to 2 PM Eastern (it has since recovered...barely). Even the drop on Black Tuesday at the start of the Great Depression was under 13%.
But okay, that’s just a day. Let’s look at a month.
Over the past month (2 PM EST January 4 to 2 PM EST on February 4), Bitcoin has dropped from slightly over $17,000 to slightly under $8,000. That’s a drop of about 53%. During the Great Depression, the market fell from a peak of 381.17 on September 3rd to a bottom of 198.60 on November 13th. That’s a drop of 48%.
Bitcoin has fallen further in one month than the DOW Jones fell in two during the single-worst economic crisis in American history.
Oh yeah. Great refuge, that Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:31:39
Because, even if it was originally intended to be used as a currency, bitcoin is largely viewed as a commodity to invest in.
So, when people pull out of the market, they pull out of *every* market.
The good news is that this may mean the losses today were just caused by investor anxiety, and that the crash that’s been going since the start of the year is over.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:34:29
Yup. Everything fell. [Except Uranium, oddly-enough](

Putting aside the logistics of moving your entire life to another country, the ones people actually want to move to are kind of hard to get into.
