how much bitcoin can one realistically mine like this per day
@_date: 2018-06-10 14:35:42

@_date: 2018-06-08 21:41:39
and how much is same as now?
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:05:28

wonder if theres a loophole in their ToS or something that would allow for a successful lawsuit against them after losing 10 bitcoins that would force them to pay out
@_date: 2018-06-03 13:42:34

@_date: 2018-06-03 14:37:36

i DONT BUY bitcoin to avoid becoming poor, this subreddit is a circlejerk of paranoia how all banks will drop their pants and one by one insert their massive black cocks into your anus and relentlessly rape you to death
@_date: 2018-07-05 08:29:26
why did lambos become the car of choice for bitcoin
@_date: 2018-07-07 07:17:15
oh now i see why people move to bitcoin, because they were refused a 2million dollar loan when theyre 50k in debt and have a minimum wage job.... fuck those banks
