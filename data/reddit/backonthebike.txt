I don't even look at graphs.. every pay day I buy $X in ETH and $X in BTC and call it a day..

its not the spending that's a problem... the merchant just needs to keep bitcoin and buy his stuff with it.

it's going to be awesome to watch them get rekt by bitcoin.. You can not control Bitcoin. It do what it wants.

That's what you call a Freudian slip

to bad rootstock is not decentralized.

Does bitcoin allow me to publish decentralized smart contracts? No? Then it won't rule them all and no rootstock is not decentralized...  The difference in these "shitcoins" is they're not trying to be a currency.. Yes, Bitcoin will be the only currency coin, no it won't be the only crypto token..
Ethereum has a place but go on, tell me how bitcoin can deliver layer 2 smart contracts and protocols.. If you've never tried to build on top of bitcoin, you don't know what you're talking about. There's a reason colored coins, etc all bailed on trying to build on top of bitcoin.
Ethereum will be the backbone of the next iteration of the world wide web. Bitcoin will be the backbone of the next iteration of finance. They aren't mutually exclusive nor do they even solve the same problems. Your loss if you miss out in the wave of innovation that's going to come out of Ethereum and it has nothing to do w/ ICO's...
I work for an ethereum company building a layer 2 protocol 100% self funded. It's not all shitcoins trying to be the "next ethereum or bitcoin".. a lot of us who have work coming down the pipeline that's going to blow you away are working on layer 2 protocols that add functionality to these blockchains.. not try to replace them.
That's where the real magic of these "shitcoins" is going to happen.. Another 2 years or so and you'll really start seeing it. The blockchain is just the beginning.

not true at all, i was buying Linden dollars and trading them for bitcoins on that games exchange thing... ah the good ol days.

No, it's not. I can not publish immutable code to the bitcoin blockchain and run it at my leisure. Transaction data !== Virtual Machine capable of processing byte code. Ethereum is far more than an ICO factory... If you think that's all it has to offer, prepare to have your mind blown over the next 2 years.
Look, I love bitcoin, it has its place, but it's not the 1 coin to rule them all.. It has a use case and it's not the same as Ethereum.
If you're trying to build a token to replace bitcoin or ethereum, however, you're a fool. It's not the blockchain, TPS, etc.. It's the community behind it building layers on top of the blockchain. Without the layer 2 protocols to provide functionality(lightning, 0x, radar relay, augur, etc) and the layer 3 dApps to provide a great user experience and UI you have nothing.
This especially goes for those creating the "ethereum/bitcoin killer" on top of ethereum and bitcoin or even worse forking and calling it Bitcoin.. :rolleyes

i'm loving it, every time it approaches 6k i start stuffing fiat dollars into the machine..

still to soon.. we'll get there.. back when email was first invented, it took a comp sci degree to operate.. it took over 40 years for it to be useable by "Joe Q Public".. Same w/ the internet.

Gotta start somewhere, it's mind blowing when you implement a borderless, permissionless, tamper proof protocol into your application.  This is where I think the real magic will come into play.. Need a decentralized auth protocol? Just pull it in and off you go. No keys, no requirements, no lock out. No matter where you come from you can have access to things you may have never had before.. Like the ability to start a business which accepts recurring subscriptions payments from a country not supported by Paypal, Stripe, or the big banks.
I have integrated several protocols now into apps for clients and it's mind blowing how awesome it is.. Another few years of iteration and refinement on this stuff and the sky's the limit.
Bitcoin seemed crazy to me too in the beginning. Nothing is impossible. I was a bitcoin pureist until someone paid me to integrate a protocol into a dApp.. It really opened my mind up to ETH and what is truly possible beyond ICO's. I think they both have a place in their respectful segment and both can change the future of how humans interact on the internet and transfer value.

wtf is a svandis?

What's funny is WBTC has more liquidity than your own "Liquid" sidechain.. NOW THAT's COMEDY!  But you keep right on thinking you're funny...  There is more BTC on Ethereum than on a native BTC chain.. Let that sink in.
@_date: 2018-07-27 12:16:28
it's probably not a PEG it's probably just a wrapper like WETH

having electricity with no ones help is far more important than any bitcoin could ever be. If you were ever going to spend some bitcoin, this is the type of thing you should spend it on.. not a car.  Being self sufficient is more valuable than financial independence.. because very little money is needed when you are self sufficient.
