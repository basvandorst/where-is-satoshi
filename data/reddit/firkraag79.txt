It was kinda down during hard forks. But higher availability then my Bank's ATMs (usually down on saturday/sunday nights here)

There used to be debit cards backed with btc (like a pre-payed debit card). Works just like visa. I think coinbase and bitpay still offer those. You can pay your coffee with them in a second, if you want to.

You can distribute your 1000 btc to a number of different wallets, thus making it way harder to steal/hack then 1 btc/1 wallet I guess.
@_date: 2019-08-23 12:26:24
That sucks. But I guess we'll see more banks (re)joining the bitcoin hype with debitcards once we hit ath. 
Then again 3k/day seems enough for most people, I guess. So you are one of those bitcoin millionaires, I guess?

Perhaps donate every migrant a mobile with btc/ltn wallet with some money on them when they pass the border.  See how that works out.

All good, just a minor correction:
* It has a **high** stock to flow ratio. With the halving next year it comes closer to golds stock to flow ratio (around 60) - higher is better
* deflationary really? It has low inflation. The sock doesn't really shrink (which in contrast happens with fiat when the Fed goes for QT again any time soon..) Instead, the supply is constant at around 2140. 
* available to all humans and everyone/everything else... (e.g. your dog and your fridge)

Well, that must really piss them off.
So they need to reshuffle their cryptos into another wallet via a number of coinjoins or something. How long does that take, a dozen blocks?
@_date: 2019-08-21 09:07:55
A high and stable price? 
Somewhat stable price comes with stable supply (we pretty much have this in BTC) and high liquidity (sorry - nowhere near high, yet). Stable any time soo? Hell no..
This is opposite of fiat (e.g. USD) where you have high liquidity (a few trillions in forex every day) and nowhere near stable supply. (QE,QT depending on how the fed executives feel that day..)  Thats why the dollar loses value year by year. Is it stable? Hell no..
So pick your poison.

Hedge, yeah? 
I'd rather say fiat is pulling an exit scam world wide the next couple years and crypto is your only way to preserve your buying power. Unless you are older then 80 years, in which case you'd more likely buy gold bars. But I'd argue you shouldn't do so, because they are more easily stolen then btc.   
Banks in Europe already starting to force negative interest rates on retail customers. You can try to cash out, but you will still suffer massive losses by inflation considering the amount of money the ECB and Fed is pumping out. Then again, try to pay with paper money in an (online) store.. good luck with that!  Welcome to the end game of the Banksters.

No. You steal buying power from everyone, especially from those who need every penny. Investors - as you call them - have many tools to escape this "confiscation". But the average joe sees (again) the buying power of his salary plummeting. "Not batting an eye" is the reaction of any affluent person to the current situation. They at most fear to lose 1% of their money when in many many years a government might decide to tax them a little bit. But I doubt it.
Strong fiat. Right. \*lol\* For the 0,01% it is somewhat good. Certainly not a good plan for the other 99,99%  unless you like to see the world continue to burn and tremble under public unrest. Not a world I'd enjoy living in no matter what. But I guess that is just me.
@_date: 2019-10-02 10:16:21
Yeah, we'll have another 2008. Only larger.

How comes Japan has this extreme debt crisis going on for years without a "real" crash. It's like bleeding to dead very slowly - and I also see this as quite a possible scenario for the whole Eurozone. ECB will eventually do QT, but they seem to have a lot of "fun" still with printing money. Can go on for decades, you just have to squash a few yellow jackets every now and then, I guess, and they are quite willing to do so.

I was just thinking : What if the real Satoshi "lost" his private keys on purpose?
Anyone moving btc from his wallet or signing messages with his key would prove nothing, only that this person was able to hack the wallet. The more days pass the weaker the argument becomes for CSW. He is clearly playing the waiting game, hoping to by luck or accident to hack/recreate the pair. Chances are minimal. But let's say for the sake of argument he gets it done. What happens the next day? Everone with a sane mind will abandon BTC and all its spin-offs, whatever it is BSV or BCH or whatnot. Because the next wallet hacked is yours and all the hacked coins will flood the market. Satoshi doesn't care, that is why he moved on. But CSW cares, because he is merchant-type who wants to sell shit. I'd argue he is a hedonist with narcisisstic traits from the few interviews I've seen. He is in for the money. That is the total opposite of the secretive, stay-back character that Satoshi seems to be. Satoshi proved a concept and solved a difficult problem. Wrote the initial code and the paper and said: Alright I solved this. Now on to something new.
TL; DR : There is no overlap in personality between CSW and Satoshi.

You should always save a fixed percentage of your income (into BTC), that way it will always be worth something to you in terms of your income. Saving 8% of your income means you will have saved one salary at the end of the year. In most years, BTC doubles or more - that gives you a free (monthly) salary for starters.
@_date: 2019-08-15 14:40:41
And what makes you think it is any different then with fiat?  
On Forex billions of currency is exhanged every day and thus moves the price. There is just so much more liquidity that the price only moves a few pips under normal circumstances.
The more traders / market makers / bigger exchanges we have in the world, the higher the liquidity and the less volatile btc becomes.   
It's just a new market. Don't be afraid of whales, be afraid of not entering the market early imho.
@_date: 2019-10-01 13:27:57
Down we go again? The tiny bounce on the EMA wil only last for so long. Looks like weakness to me. Perhaps if the S&amp;P goes south big, we might see some Wallstreet money (re-)entering to BTC.  But if history repeats itself we go sideways till 05/2020 at least.

You don't need AI. You just need the shorter cable so that you can front run any sell or buy order. This happens on Nasdaq (and every exchange) the whole time, because it is a shitty, insecure system. And it is regulated for years. But the regulators can do little. Sometimes they catch a small fish and sacrifice it, but the show goes on. They are like the little police officers in a world ruled by the mafia I suppose. And in crypto you don't even have that little police, as it is completely unregulated.

It didn't come out of nowhere. 
Whales usually wait until the volume dies of (which it did over the last couple days) and then strike. So their sell-off has maximum impact and triggers many stopp-loss orders. Afterwards they collect cheap coins or just take the profits from the short trade, run and wait for the next opportunity.
@_date: 2019-09-03 15:23:22
Sure, but think about a 2x leveraged long with half your stack of btc in a bull market. That puts the liquidation price pretty low and grants you additional "free" sathoshis if the price goes up aka double dipping.
@_date: 2019-09-23 10:28:10
...and down goes the price!
@_date: 2019-09-23 10:29:23
So you better invest into corporate bonds? ;-D
@_date: 2019-09-03 07:13:10
Big players (e.g. Fed, Ecb and many private banks) are exactly doing that with gold for a few years now. It is a no-brainer when you print the money yourself or can easily acquire it at zero cost. Interest is always payed for with tax money. So you get free a asset and also can control the price.
Otherwise it is a risky game, but maybe worthwile.

Suppressing price via paper trading (mostly shorting) has worked for Gold, Silver and a ton of other poo-poo. (e.g. J.P. Morgan and the silver..) It works with BTC just as well which is only a fraction of the gold market. (yet)
@_date: 2019-09-25 14:54:53
It happens on regulated markets all the time. It is how the market works, especially one where you can short sell naked options to generate fear. Or buy call options en masse to generate fomo. Or just do both to control the price at a level that you wish. (like what JP Morgan does with silver..).
Each of these "manipulations" is an attempt to make money. And I'd argue this last attempt was pretty successful for that shortseller. Low volume, market reacts quickly to price drop, bots/stopp losses trigger. Cover your short, and walk away with the money. Rince and repeat until the market is bleed out.

If you are into bitcoin for a while you will realize that only fiat (USD/EUR..) drops in value rather then bitcoin appreciating in value (which it does also, but very little, as yet only very few people own BTC). It is also the best thing (perhaps besides gold) to own in a negative yield market. Enjoy your savings in bitcoin!

Time in the market &gt;&gt; Timing the market.
So better have a little bit of BTC and not waiting for "the perfect moment". Chances are you miss it.
@_date: 2019-09-25 14:47:41
You ever checked out how option trading works? A naked short for example. You put a huge stake on any exchange then naked short sell very quickly so that bots, algos and stopp losses are triggered immediately. The price drops furhter. You cover your short at a lower price and walk away with a huge gain. Never even had to own that crypto or a wallet. You were never "in", as you think they are.This would only end if exchanges / people would no longer lend there btc so that other people can short sell it. But this is pretty much the only business model they have, so don't hold your breath waiting for that to happen.
Best thing as a hodler ist to have a few put options at or above your average entry price to cover your long, so that in case of a market implosion or rapid down movement you don't lose too much. But these options cost a few bucks, so it is like an insurance.
