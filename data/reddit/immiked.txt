I talked with one friend in particular about BTC about four or five years ago. He bought some little USB miners and I balked at him saying I got permission from my wife (lul) to buy a BFL miner preorder from eBay. 
So I paid, I got a copy of the invoice and all that. But then something strange happens; the seller told me he must send me a receipt for customs. So he used PayPal to create a shipping by label and by doing that allowed him to mark the item as "shipped". 
Obv this screamed scam to me at this point. I called PayPal and called eBay and told them the story. Both told me to wait and see if I receive the product. 
So I was on BFL's website twenty times a day seeing if this invoice number had shipped. Once it finally did the seller disappeared as expected. 
Once again I'm on the phone with eBay and PayPal both screaming. I file claims with both. This part almost screwed me.  I go two weeks without hearing anything, and then I get an email:  my claim was denied because the seller marked as "shipped" (so obv it shipped right??)
So were I messed up was misunderstanding the claims process. You see, apparently eBay and PayPal are completely separate companies, except for their fraud/claims depts. I filled out a claim with eBay, and then with PayPal. Once eBay saw this they deleted my claim without telling me anything, then it was PayPal that denied me. 
So off to the police station I go, armed with all the info I could muster, trying to explain what digital currency was to a police officer who I'm sure thought I was on drugs, to have a report made. 
One police report and a $5.00 fax to eBay later, they get PayPal to reverse the charge and I get my $3500 back. Much to the enjoyment of my wife. 
And that is my Butterfly Labs story.
