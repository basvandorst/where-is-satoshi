Ah there you go, the technical term for what I was trying to express.

I think he is just really bad at making shit up.  I do not know how he got to that specific point in his life in this video.  He was like "As you see, we have a lot of IP addresses, I mean, look....that's a lot."  I'm like....WTF? Who cares?  What the fuck are you even talking about?  Side note: I used to be a senior engineer for GE.  This guy would never make it onto our team. His mindless mumbling about nothing is like the biggest red flag to somebody who actually knows what they are doing.
@_date: 2015-12-09 04:13:27
Is it just me or do they come off as "Hey we have a lot of really expensive stuff and we get to play with it." And they don't really have anything to say.  It's almost like the first part of the video was just to show off his expensive monitors.  The re-occuring theme was "We have a bunch of nodes and there is no software to monitor them."  Really?  How have all the other clusters been monitored and managed since the beginning of computing?  The kid he hired seems smart, but he just seems to be playing around with making a cool graphical interface.  Figures since he is an Apple whore.  Somebody invested a ton of money into their project and it seems like they are just playing around with it and have no real applications for it.  I noticed the employee had a helmet on his desk.  What a dream job that would be for me.  Ride my nice motorcycle into work and get paid a fair salary to just play around with a big cluster.

Amazingly balanced.  It wasn't a FUD fest like the news on websites has been.  That NY guy wants to pull it into the major technology webs the real exchanges run and then regulate the hell out of it.

Confirms?  The title itself says "Apparent Theft" and then they go on to speculate about the rumors.  I think it might be true, personally, but this article "confirms" nothing.

It's funny, but putting a fake quote like that with his name at the end could get you in some serious legal trouble.
@_date: 2014-02-24 03:23:23
Yes it does feel like that sometimes.  Honestly, whenever I'm cruising around I always wonder how many fun things I can't do because it is probably illegal.  The legal system is like a supermassive black hole getting bigger and bigger by the year.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:52:00
Might be a good idea.
@_date: 2014-02-24 03:25:25
I think they want to do this so you can't hide money away in accounts that the legal system can't touch.  Say you had debt that made it to collections or whatever, they want to be able to discover your cryptocurrency and then take it.  Also, taxes, of course.

In the moment people still thought it was legitimate. Whether or not it actually was. That is the point here.

Yep a lot of scrypt alts are ~200% more profitable than Bitcoin right now.  It would be stupid to mine BTC with GPU's the last week or so, based on the 7 day averages at coinchoose.com.

For the first time in my life I have actually started contemplating living in SEA instead of the US, and I have never even been anywhere in SEA.  Things haven't been going well here for 6-7 years and I don't see them getting better for a while.  I think it's possible we see a crash this decade that is 10x worse than last decade.

I feel like you are the only other person in the world who thinks like me.  I worked in offices for the last 12 years and the sad fact is that computers just increased the amount of paper in this world, probably by orders of magnitude.  It really is mind blowingly ridiculous.  No joke, I worked at place that would print stuff out just to have it scanned into a digital archiving program.  They literally printed things onto paper in order to have it then scanned and digitally archived.  And then they had to keep the paper in storage for at least 90 days due to legal reasons.  Absolute madness.

I did a withdrawal on Camp BX to Dwolla today.  It was literally instant.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:07:34
Also a lot of exchanges and stuff have an arbitrary withdraw limit of 0.01.  A week ago that wasn't very much in terms of USD, now it is significant.  Let me move my small amounts of Bitcoin around!  I know they did it for transaction spam limits, but what is the point of having it divisible by 8 decimal places if most places adopt a 0.01 minimum?
@_date: 2013-08-31 02:58:55
0% and their reason behind that is that they "paired up" with BitPay.  I don't know how it is sustainable, but the theory from others is that it is just a way for them to buy Bitcoins at a rate slightly lower than the markets by using a weighted average for the value at which you "sell" your Bitcoins to pay for your bill.  Whatever, works for me.

I put up with the slowness for the ability to actually deposit and withdraw USD from my bank account.  Something that no other exchange can do right now AFAIK.

There was actually a driver/plugin in every program to export right into it. But have you seen the average age of an office worker in SoCal? Teaching them new computer skills is next to impossible.

Yes I also noticed that he poo-poo's on logging into your Bitcoin "account" or whatever, but completely forgets every other damn thing tied to your money that you are logged into on your computer.  Like somehow it is different.  These guys are so ignorant of technology and facts it makes for comedy gold.

After Gox had their Dwolla account shut down I signed up for CampBX to get my USD in to the BTC world.  At the time, last week, the spread was huge.  I ended up "chasing the dragon" all the way up to right now trying to buy for a good price.  Now the prices are very close.  Wish I could have bought while the spread was bigger.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:39:42


"Wow, sounds interesting.  Hang on, that's really expensive.  That's for 1 ounce of gold!?  I couldn't afford that."  Then after you explain to them they can buy gold in little 1 gram bars they go "Oh hell yeah!  So I can own some gold!"  I think it's a bit rash to assume because someone can't own a whole Bitcoin they will never want it.  It's all over the news right now, people are trying to get their hands on it no matter what.  It will get way easier to mentally digest if we actually switch to mBTC.

That looks like a really cool tube headphone amp.  I actually built myself a tube headphone amp recently for pretty cheap, but I don't think I've seen a prebuilt one with a decent price like that.

When you did your performance testing, was it just benchmarking itself?  Or did you have multiple machines hammering it across a network to simulate a real load?

Just heard about Havelock yesterday.  Saw it getting posted all over forums.  About 5 times I clicked on links and got DNS resolution errors.  Thought it was my ISP, but it turns out it was something else.  One time I was actually able to get through.
