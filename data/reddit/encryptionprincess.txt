Why is there no block explorer? I think we all know the answer. Smoke and mirrors.

Did not mean to imply that u/nullc made the PR. I just felt he deserved credit for [his work](

Great interview u/bigreddmachine
I found the history of how mimblewimble was introduced to u/andytoshi vry interesting. Privacy and scaling improvements are on the way for Bitcoin!

This paper is primarily about math and cryptography. It is absolutely relevant to Bitcoin. Confidential Transactions are something that could benefit bitcoin tremendously. The paper is not meant to promote another coin as this research has yet to be implemented anywhere.

I agree that Monero is not perfectly fungible right now. Perfection is very difficult to achieve and the pursuit is ongoing.  
Please consider supporting the Monero Stack Exchange proposal where difficult questions can and should be asked:
Due it its unique codebase and focus I think it is appropriate for Monero to become the 3rd crypto after Bitcoin and Ethereum with its own Stack Exchange site.

I do not assume that the price was below market (large buyers may even pay a premium for that level of liquidity).
Your second assumption is even worse as the buyer is more likely to be a long term holder than a trader who will suddenly want to dump their coin.

It should be noted that regulatory compliance is still possible with ring signature-based and zero knowledge cryptocurrencies. (see existing Monero view key functionality). However privacy decisions remain under complete control of the user. 
Bitcoin can adopt new features to make it easy for users to voluntarily comply with regulations. Bribing miners to censor transactions will never be accepted by the bitcoin community.
