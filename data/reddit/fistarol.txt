Good perspective. I entered this journey for the same reasons. I think it will change how we perceive currency. Have my upvote

Please dont spread fud. Your post is retarded. So you bought bitcoin 5 years ago for what? 100 bucks? Then you forgot about it and now is 16000 dolars. You make 79500 dolars and are complaining that you have to pay a 33 bucks fee, wich is 0,05%. Right. So sell the coins and fuck off. Nobody needs you. Go back to your cave and die

Crypto pro is very good. Blockfolio too, but better for keeping track of your portfolio. Fisrt one is paid, second is free

Unfortunately not. It does have a nice “app” , but if you go to the reddit and read you will see that its a failed experiment (so far), and the trust issue has not been solved

Stay away. Full of scammers.

How secure it is to buy with you?
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:18:17
No it will not. It is a scammers infested place

Your estimate is terrible wrong, as there is only (almost) 17.000.000 bitcoins. ��
