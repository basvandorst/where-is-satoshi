One thing about you bitcoiner's is you don't know how to get people excited about the technology. You say you don't why it's not getting mainstream...well the fucking reason is you assholes discourage people from investing when they ask questions. You should encourage people to buy, not try and confuse them.

I suggest you buy bitcoin even if you don't understand it because I guarantee over 3/4 of the people on here do not fully understand the bitcoin technology

Understand that, I just have been around it for a very long time and have a solid understanding of what it takes to make some money. My target market would be people who are not knowledgeable to sift through the information of the internet and find material that will guide them or people who do not have the time to do all the research/trading/etc

What if I had a bitcoin ATM in my office where the customers bought the bitcoin off of the ATM and then could exchange between me and them for altcoins(then I wouldn't be officially dealing in cash!) which might bypass running a currency exchange. Done some research, and California is currently a grey area for compliance regarding virtual currencies. I think I would be compliant, and safe...but I'm going to continue to do research until I can say that with certainty haha
