I don't see that in mine. Where do you see it? Did they prompt for it when you logged in or is it in your verification section?
Also, what verification level are you?

Atlanta Bitcoin is in the process of obtaining a Money Transmitter/MSB license in the state of GA and Federally. So everything will be operated within the law.

BTW Lamassu has shipped 2 devices now.

I'm glad this sort of thing is being developed but in order to win over an existing merchant, bitcoin payments need to be integrated into the POS they already use. I speak from experience having been in the traditional payment processing industry for the last 12 years. 
One of the problems of building this from scratch is that all the other incumbent POS systems have had years to develop functionality and the merchants have been using that functionality for years as well. So you can't say, here take this POS so you can accept Bitcoin. And you can't say, Well, use this POS too so you can accept Bitcoin. 
I commend the efforts but the only way I see this making serous in roads is for someone like bitpos to partner with a POS manufacturer to add this functionality to an existing POS with an existing userbase.

ETA is November for the licensing. No operations until all is finalized and legit.

Yep, it's gonna be fun. Be sure to check out Atlanta Bitcoin's booth. They're supposed to have the first Lamassu Bitcoin ATM in the states there at the booth.

So did you provide CC info? If you did or do eventually, I'm curious about how it impacts your level or instant purchase limit.
@_date: 2013-10-01 15:06:12
Check this link. PM Ken...

I'm local in Atlanta so I'll of course be there but would be happy to meet up. 
@_date: 2013-10-03 21:20:10
I'll be there!
@_date: 2013-09-30 21:43:33
Are there any POS systems that have Bitcoin integrations?
@_date: 2013-10-01 00:38:26
What type of merchants are you targeting? Is this being presented as a POS to replace what they use now or a 2nd POS for just Bitcoin? 
Do you also accept CCards and Cash through this POS?
