Neon is what I use for NEO. It will let you collect the GAS which NEO generates as well.

You need to do some more research. Bitcoin price is too volatile and the transfer fees are way too high for you to be accepting this at a small store. Something like Litecoin, Dash, etc. would be better.
I know I may get downvoted for this because I'm in this subreddit but I don't ever see bitcoin hitting mainstream adoption as a daily use currency. They have some massive scaling issues to figure out that other currencies are further along at having improved upon. I think the value will stay high as basically an indicator of the strength of the crypto market overall, and I could see it being adopted for big transactions, but it's not going to be something you use to buy beer at a gas station or something.
I actually tried to buy something online the other week with bitcoin but when I realized I was going to have to pay a $15 transfer fee I backed out instantly and used Western Union instead.

If you're gonna be short term/day trading anything you need to know what you're doing. Right now you're just trying to randomly guess at what the peaks and valleys are. 
Best thing right now is to not be reactionary, chill out and just wait. I've only been investing in crypto for a few months and this has happened like 5-6x already. It's normal. Just leave it alone, otherwise some bad luck can wipe out plenty of money.

Trying to randomly guess dips and peaks is a great way to lose a shit ton of money.

Turning to bitcoin in the face of a worthless national currency in order to survive is not the same thing as bitcoin replacing a strong currency among relatively affluent consumers.

That's one of the reasons. If you want to buy altcoins normally you'd buy BTC and then transfer that to the exchange. However, with the huge explosion in popularity the transfer times are getting really slow and the fees are going way up. Litecoin is cheaper on the fees and much faster to transfer to exchanges.
I'm sure another part of it is just that most people getting into crypto right now are doing it through Coinbase. The only three currencies you can get on there are Bitcoin/Litecoin/Eth, and I think the general feeling is that the huge short term explosion for Bitcoin is mostly done for now, so people are buying Litecoin in hopes that it will see a similar pump.

Dude if you're this lazy then investing in crypto probably isn't the greatest idea

He's the CEO of Bitcoin.com, a website. There is no CEO of bitcoin.

Yeah the fee's are getting crazy. Litecoin has been exploding recently because of how expensive it is to move bitcoin now.

Awesome research you have here buddy

Anonymity is one of the huge selling points of Bitcoin... so no

Aside from volatility, how is this at all different from normal investing or currency trading? It's not like the government gives you money if you lose a ton of money doing that.

Here is my advice: Read the sidebar. There's a lot to investing in crypto, nobody is just gonna be able to type out a little paragraph that will instantly answer all your questions.

You're too dumb to not be a troll
