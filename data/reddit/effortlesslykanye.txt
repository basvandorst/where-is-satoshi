I restored my wallet from seed previously. Will try again.

Thanks. I am concerned that there’s a mix up in the seed for the wallet. When I restored from seed, a very small amount of coin I had in that wallet went away. That probably indicates that I restored from the wrong seed. I’ll see if I can find the right one, but it’s not looking good... shit.

Following the transfer that didn’t make it (described in my original post), I restored the wallet from a functioning / real seed, but it must have been the wrong seed because it zeroed out a small balance in that wallet.

I have the private key and i restored the wallet. I can no longer see the address and the bitcoin is not in the wallet.

Thanks for talking me through this. I really appreciate it.

Let’s talk. I didn’t think that was possible, though.

Thanks, but the larger transaction wasn’t me.  I don’t know anything about it.  I don’t understand why those transactions are under the same txid. Mine was a xfer from Coinbase.

I’ve tried that, but will try again...

Thanks. I'll do my research and see if any of those solutions are an option. Haven't been following the bitcoin news lately. Will read up. Thanks again.

Thanks again. I think I'm going to wait it out... Mostly because I'm not sure how to send with a higher fee. Any idea how long it'll take to clear the backlog?

Thanks - I really appreciate your help.  I've not come across this issue before and didn't give you the correct information.  Maybe this helps: it was an approximately .2 transaction and it is unconfirmed in the sending wallet had has not yet arrived in my receiving wallet.  Does this link contain the information you need to further assist? Genuinely grateful for any help you can provide.
