I wish you the best of luck. I've definitely learned the hard way never to mess with transaction fees.

I believe this.
Korbit just switched from Woori to Shinhan for KRW deposits. To us, this isn't an issue and therefore I'm certain this will not affect us.
Now if banks were to close personal customer accounts for deposits to cryptocurrency exchanges, like the US has done, then we'd have a serious issue. Well, haha, not us per se but them, because speaking for myself I'd just close my account and open one with a bank that supports crypto, such as Shinhan.

It states that but I still worry. I hope they come back soon honestly.

I did the same thin in a different exchange and had to pay a small fee and wait a month but I finally got them back. Just contact your exchange.

I did this with my son's savings and after two weeks it didn't confirm.  
Finally, because I had both private keys, I took matters into my own hands and performed a Child Pays For Parent transaction. Can't even begin to describe the feeling up until that first confirmation.
It was hell.

Well I read somewhere they're going to release their own cryptocurrency, so I think they've gotten permission from regulators.

Do you have the p I ate Kevin w you I the receiving address? You may eventually need them to carry out Child Pays For Parent. I did. My transaction was stuck for 15 days, scary!

If I've tried to send bitcoins from Blockchain.info with too low a transaction fee, will the coins eventually reappear in the original wallet? (I read somewhere that it takes about two weeks if the transaction isn't confirmed)

Thanks for the link.
That is pretty much Coinbase's approach. If you don't live in the US they won't let you trade. I wish I could say that's reasonable, but I'm not sure.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:18:44
Haha! I used to be quite loud about it, my wife too. Now that the price has risen so much that buying an entire one seems unobtainable, even though we've told people you can buy smaller portions, there's no more discussion. They all assume I'm rich and it's a shame.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:53:35
I'm wondering how much I'll pay in transaction fees 10 years from now.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:00:38
They're potentially going to prevent us expats, aka foreigners, from using those exchanges too though, right?
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:51:56
I imagined being right in that conversation. I believe the word for him is ornery, or ass.

They canceled my transaction and after I complained and asked them to reinstate it, they said that I can no longer trade with them because of my history. Every time I've bought/sold bitcoins they have made money. A lot of money too. Because of my foolish trading. 
Recently I wanted to buy at a reasonable rate they wouldn't sell to me and I feel that I actually lost out.
They haven't closed my account, but said that I can no longer trade with them. I am so disappointed. 
I wasn't buying large amounts either. The last time was only one coin.
I really wish I could do business with them again to be honest. 
If you reading this Coinbase, I've learned my lesson not to foolishly trade.

I'd like to start my own node, with a raspberry pi, and tutorials you'd recommend.
@_date: 2016-12-04 02:20:20
Thanks. Doesn't the drive that will store the Blockchain need to be larger though? He's using a 128GB USB flash drive. I'd just assume a 250GB standard external HDD would work.
@_date: 2016-12-08 16:23:53
I bought today. So happy now. Just wished I could have bought more.
What's your guys predictions on when people will staying selling in mass? I thought I saw an estimate at $2,500.
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:01:30
Yes they did. I bought right before the minor outage and then the rise. Pretty content!
@_date: 2017-09-13 03:56:09
I would really like to know where the stock image is coming from.

I love that city. Pretty soon though it'll be Singapore

Thank you all. 
This is the article that I saw that sort of caught me by surprise.
[Why "Non-Mining Full Nodes" Are A Terrible Idea](
Is there anyway to verify that "your node" is contributing to the community?
@_date: 2017-10-21 01:13:13
Hear hear!!
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:48:34
She sounds like me pitching to my friend &amp; family. Love it!
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:34:25
I'm running a full node, but not mining. 
Can someone please give me the TL;DR about WHY this is bad?
@_date: 2017-06-24 04:52:36
I'm actually like "NO. Don't do anything."
 Had to sell some bits to pay credit card and hoping to buy back at the same price in a month's time.
@_date: 2017-06-27 02:06:25
So serious question. I'm travelling to the states in a month's time for a small vacation. 
Should I delete all bitcoin related apps on my phone?
What if one of them knows about bitcoin, asks for my phone, then pulls up Google Authenticator?
Maybe there should be a HowTo, FAQ, or Guide related to dealing with the TSA and owning bitcoin.
