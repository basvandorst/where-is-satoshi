I am finding a bitcoin chocolate and I might loaded up my fridge with this and will hodl it for a long time.
@_date: 2018-10-15 10:47:51
tether is melting. Should I still hodl?

aw! I can feel the hurt.
@_date: 2019-08-02 08:37:16
I know for sure that in every pain there is a blessing that will come to us, btc will have a good market soon.
@_date: 2019-08-06 14:20:47
let's consider it going up
@_date: 2019-10-26 15:39:35

@_date: 2018-11-26 12:07:45

@_date: 2018-11-23 08:26:39
the wheels on the bus go round and round 
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:51:16
bitcoin at $3k+ hodl or no hodl? 
@_date: 2018-11-20 07:59:10
yes it is. rocket took up and straight below us. :'( this will be bad for hodlers.
@_date: 2018-11-11 02:59:58
Proven that the future of bitcoin technology is high-enough to appreciate.
@_date: 2018-11-26 12:17:52
it's a trap
@_date: 2018-11-12 02:01:50
this was better than the other first rule.
@_date: 2018-12-09 06:13:00
we will survive. Btc might pump back to $4k
@_date: 2018-12-17 08:32:41
wait until btc drops to $2k now it's the perfect time. lol
