dude, you have to end the messages with "verify"

Then flesh out your arguments to emphasize the points where hi is wrong. You should welcome questioning, not be put off by skepticism or momentary lapses of attention.
I think that you have an argument to make in using the satelites for crisis situations. I'd like to read it!

Much jwow
@_date: 2014-06-22 04:46:34
Yep, that is the practical solution
@_date: 2014-06-22 16:02:43
Yep, I agree. But you can't counter greed with common sense. 
I think that we will either see a gradual drift to another cryptocurrency, or a gradual development of bitcoin to mimic the most useful aspects of the best altcoins, if there is a better altcoin and if bitcoin stays alive. 
The solution for a crypto enthusiast who doesn't develop or mine is to bet on another coin if bitcoin blows up. 
The average joe might leave the scene. But I believe that most of the investors, miners, and developers will stay in touch with other cryptocurrencies. 
The idea is here and it has spread like wildfire. It will still burn, even if it changes colour.

You can do better than this
@_date: 2014-05-04 22:19:53
[The paw must go on](
Print the wallets anyway and I'll send 100 doges to each of them. Make it 50 wallets, fifty wallets. Post the adresses here and put up an imgur album of whatever that happens tomorrow
If anyone asks. Tell them that a herring and his potato wanted them to have it

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA256
You are receiving this message because your email address is associated with an account on bitcointalk.org. I regret to have to inform you that some information about your account was obtained by an attacker who successfully compromised the bitcointalk.org server. The following information about your account was likely leaked: - Email address - Password hash - Last-used IP address and registration IP address - Secret question and a basic (not brute-force-resistant) hash of your secret answer - Various settings
You should immediately change your forum password and delete or change your secret question. To do this, log into the forum, click "profile", and then go to "account related settings".
If you used the same password on bitcointalk.org as on other sites, then you should also immediately change your password on those other sites. Also, if you had a secret question set, then you should assume that the attacker now knows the answer to your secret question.
Your password was salted and hashed using sha256crypt with 7500 rounds. This will slow down anyone trying to recover your password, but it will not completely prevent it unless your password was extremely strong.
While nothing can ever be ruled out in these sorts of situations, I do not believe that the attacker was able to collect any forum personal messages.
I apologize for the inconvenience and for any trouble that this may cause. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----
