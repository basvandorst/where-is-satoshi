It’s about how *accessible* it is for someone to evade tax with this, I am well aware of the HSBC scandal etc but this is accessible to almost everybody

Yes I agree, but this is just too easy compared to other manoeuvres someone could apply. I feel there has to be some way of tracing this but I can’t think of one and hence the post here lol

Haha I’ve never used those machines, I just walked past one and thought about this then posted here cause of how crazy it is that the minimum without ID is £500

1) It doesn’t ask for a phone number
2) the cameras depend on where the ATM is - coffee shops, post offices etc
3) a camera overhead does nothing for the tax department in tracing revenues. Someone could be filing regular tax returns and still launder money through bitcoin ATMs. 
This is one of those comments which you felt really good about when typing but is total trash. r/iamverysmart

Dude it doesn’t piss me off that’s the thing - I’m a libertarian, there are very few things I hate more than I hate taxes and the government (my reddit name is literally a line by Gordon Gekko from Wall Street lol) - I’m just a nerd and I’m curious of how stupid the gov is to not think about this

This post isn’t for me doing it, I’m just curious about how the revenue department just lets this slide

Yeah I’m not talking about doing it I’m just curious about why/how did the government approve of this - I’m an accounting/tax nerd so it’s weird how this is a major loophole

Yep exactly, I feel there should be more KYC requirements for these ATMs too or at least not have the minimum set at £500 that’s way too high.

Yeah but if you get your income paid in bitcoin and then sell that for cash - there isn’t any traceability for taxation purposes?
