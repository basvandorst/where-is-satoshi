This sounds like the once in a lifetime opertunity I been waiting for. A broke 23 year old foreign student who wants to start up a new coin but hasn't got a computer !!! How can this fail ??!!
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:43:14
I think its quite good :)
For years people have bought computers and have been given windows preloaded on it, (we not counting mac users, this is windows v linux) As a result they are afraid to try Linux unless they are computer "smart" 
Sticking with windows they are "sheep" as they continue to be loyal to a brand, often even unaware there is a alternative.
The similarities with fiat and btc is quite amazing, just like people have grown up with windows, people who have grown up with fiat are unsure about using another system, just like switching to Linux on their PCs, switching to btc scares them. They would rather stick to the system they have been "conditioned" to use. Sheep. 
To break away and download and install a new operating system requires someone to understand there is a alternative, understanding there could be a alternative to fiat also requires someone who can think for themselves and not just go along with what they have been conditioned to use.

He has a drink problem, the first thing he will buy when he gets money is alcohol, if he was a smackhead then it would be heroin. In your mind does that mean he should not be given any money at all? Your comment is a very simplistic view and shows no compassion or understanding of the issue. He needs help, the best thing would be to get clean and stop drinking but that would require him to go into rehab and there is no rehab unless you rich and famous or get on Jeremy kyles tv show :( 
I just think I could help him out a little and maybe give him a way to get a little extra money,. 
People like me who enable him !!! You fucking moron. He is going to get the alcohols from somewhere, if he has no money he will steal it or commit some other crime to pay for it. He is a addict.

@_date: 2015-07-26 21:00:20
Yup, you right. I have made the same mistake before where what to me is obviously a joke is read word for word and taken literally by others. A while ago with my original reddit account I was a mod on reddit and I told this guy that he needed to message the mod of the sub ( which was obviously me) and ask him if he was able to post. I also said that the mod of the sub ( yes me) was a evil hacker and he would either let him post or hack into his computer and make it explode. Now not for 1 second did I expect the reply I got !!! He replied that he was not going to risk getting hacked and have his computer blown up so he was deleting his reddit account !!! I replied i was joking but it was too late and he had already deleted his reddit account !!. ( yes he was American)
Poe's law should be observed to help out non English speakers and north Americans but then in return the north Americans should learn to spot subtle humour and at the very least blatant irony
@_date: 2015-07-14 23:07:42
Your not telling me anything I don't know. I am aware of the limits on cash withdraws from Greek ATM's but I could say to you "let those people go and spend their limitless amount of btc in their local butchers or bakers or supermarket" sure we can say how great btc is while posting pictures of sad looking people queuing up to use a fiat ATM but I would rather we were a bit more sympathetic to their situation rather than use it to score cheap points.
It just comes across as  " oh look at the sad peasants at their failed bank while we eat pizza and play with our laptops"  or that the impression I got anyway. That last picture was totally unnecessary.

10,000 ??  That a lot of workers, clients, family and friends .
I think changetip do a 1 time tip link that you can SMS but doing 10,000 of them is going to be very time consuming, if you contacted them they may possibly be able to help you automate it somehow though as I guess it would generate 10,000 new accounts for them

I'm not offended ! I just think the picture was unnecessary and exploitation of some older people who are having a hard time. It added nothing to what was a good positive post about a bitcoin meet up. 
I may seem "the kind of person that thinks negativity is never beneficial for learning or that positivity is always a better way to learn everything in this world"  but you my friend seem like a arrogant little cunt :)
@_date: 2015-07-15 18:34:27
Maybe not top but fîrst , what got you started you in btc ?
@_date: 2015-07-18 19:18:18
On boy :( 
31 btc ? 31 whole btc ? 
I kinda had a similar experience some time ago. I took advantage of a well known poker sites free $10 introduction offer. Not at all a gambler but I like poker as a game. Anyway after a few months of playing 2cent blinds I had well over $100 and decided I would cash in $100 of it. It was a nightmare, stupid requests for I'd confirmation that kept being refused for absurd reasons, a whole chain of emails between me and there Gibraltar based customer support. In the end I told them to just donate my balance to a children's charity and close my account ( pretty sure they never did).
Was around $130?? Maybe $140 ?? In total ( can't remember now, fair time ago) but I understand how you feel , they take the piss and you feel unless you can physically find and visit their HQ you are not going to get your money back. 
31 btc a big hit though , holy cow 31 :(
Gutted for you.

Easy way to transfer it and get more than the base exchange rate :)
Step 1, withdraw it all as cash.
Step 2, stuff in a suitcase and fly to UK.
Step 3, when arrived at airport, sell AUD to people flying out to Australia for good old British pounds :)

I think 2cents is to high when 0.2 cents works as well. Not everyone got a huge pile of coins and if you want btc to succeed then you want people to get a good first impression. No one is going to send a big amount at first, they going to test it out with a few small transactions first and the 2 cent fee could seem high if they only moving change about. 0.2 cents is a much more attractive fee.

Someone who's getting tired of the same guy regularly posting anti changetip stuff. He's part of pro tip ( but will deny it ) he used to post using his main but recently has been using alts. He posted earlier with this account and straight after posting any pro bitcoin/change tip posts were downvoted while all the buttcoin comments were upvoted. Doesn't take a genius to figure it out.

Wow, admire your dads dedication, I don't know how house sells go in your country but here in the UK I don't think the solicitors handling the sale of the property you were purchasing would except it. Maybe in the future but right now I'm pretty sure it would not happen. 
If you are renting in between the time you sell and buy a new house I guess it could work out but if you in a chain situation I think it going to be a huge issue.
@_date: 2015-03-23 14:52:35
Have a go yourself on this sub, link your business and tip people for signing up, if it bitcoin related then people will be interested, if you tip them some coin they will be even more interested !

@_date: 2015-03-26 10:06:43
Kinda sounds like a quick response from someone who not really very interested. We can't force them to take btc, we need to make them want to except btc and the best way to do this is by more people mailing there support asking for a btc option. Get all your team to mail them, make a post on their reddit page ( I see this post been crossed post so I assume they have a active sub) get as many people to comment on the thread. Also offer advice for setting up a secure way for them to use btc if they worried about it. Best of luck, hope they see the light !.
@_date: 2015-03-27 17:30:42
You are not doing yourself any favours making new accounts to advertise this, again.

Sorry to be the one who says it , but I saw some photos of that base camp a while ago and the amount of rubbish left there by teams going to the summit was astounding, it looked awful, personally I would be happier if he just took some pictures and then took it down rather than leave it there to break up and end up as more abandoned stuff left to clutter up what should be a natural wilderness.

Of course but I see a problem when nobody uses btc as a currency. I don't have any figures but I just get the feeling that 99% of people that have any btc just hodl and hope and that is holding back its growth and user adoption. 
@_date: 2015-03-28 21:10:38

Wallet Wednesday probably the best of a poor bunch lol :)

Yup , fake accounts making bullshit posts with statements like "great customer service" makes sure I will never click onto their site.
@_date: 2015-03-12 19:30:07
I'm not sure this a good idea :(
Black flags have been on the news a lot lately , IS and terrorism. Outside of the bitcoin community there still a lot of misconception around btc and one of those misconceptions is terrorist groups using it. I don't think putting a bit coin symbol on a black flag is going to help.
I really think it a bad move putting this on a black flag, why not a blue flag ? Green ? Anything other than black.
Personally the only kinda black flag t shirt I would wear would be a big skull and crossbones pirate one !

Can recommend these guys though 
Don't think they do btc though, but they nice guys and great customer service. Sent me some free trial bottles after I got talking to them on reddit. Not vaped any yet, just finishing up a old bottle of juice then I can pop in a new head and give it a vape :)
@_date: 2015-03-27 12:49:03
Do your friends who you are going to send the tips to already have wallets and btc or will this be the first bits for them ? Im guessing they probably new or you would just send it to their wallets. Change tip a great introducer to btc but that quite a lot of coin you sending so please remember to help them out with advice on different wallets and storage and also give them some links to where they could spend that coin too.
@_date: 2015-03-28 10:39:29
I got a few bits in my changetip and last night I thought instead of just hording them I thought I would look into actually spending them. 
I'm a newish e-cig  vapour ( give it a try if you a smoker, best thing I ever did) so i'v been looking at online e juice and came across these guys. They do small 5ml sample bottles which is great if you like me and struggling to find a juice you like. They are also very well priced and offer a additional discount to reddit guys. You can contact them via reddit too Edit, typo in the guys reddit name @_date: 2015-03-24 19:01:03
Ask you anything ? Why do you feel the need to make a brand new reddit account to post bullshit ?
@_date: 2015-03-22 15:39:29
It does sound good and I have heard good things about vapeboy. Yet to try it myself though.

Can't take credit for this joke, stole it from someone else last St Patrick's day.
Three Irishmen, Paddy, Sean and Seamus, were stumbling home from the pub late one night and found themselves on the road which led past the old graveyard.. “Come have a look over here,” says Paddy, “It’s Michael O’Grady’s grave, God bless his soul. He lived to the ripe old age of 87.” “That’s nothing,” says Sean, “here’s one named Patrick O’Toole, it says here that he was 95 when he died.”! Just then, Seamus yells out, “Good God, here’s a fella that got to be 145!” “What was his name?” asks Paddy. Seamus stumbles around a bit, awkwardly lights a match to see what else is written on the stone marker, and exclaims, “Miles, from Dublin.”

Sometimes I wish people would stop seeing btc as a store of value. At the weekend I bought some e-cig juice using bitcoin, supporting the retailer who took the step of incorporating btc, supporting the company that handled his btc transactions, supporting everyone who holds on to their bitcoin by giving btc "real world value".
If btc becomes just a store of value because no one ever actually uses it for trade then that " value" becomes very vulnerable to huge price swings. In my opinion btc as a store of value is playing right into the hands of the city investors and banks, we are handing it to them to manipulate right down to 1$ if they wanted.
Btc needs to be spendable if we want it to succeed, the retailers who put effort into excepting it should be rewarded with trade, if no one spends btc what message does this send to the retailer and other retailers looking into btc? 
The bitcoin economy needs people to use btc, people sitting on a digital wallet just hoping the value of those digital coins rise risk that value slumping to 0.

Yes I think it is much more appealing to others if you make the tip more personal instead of just a tip and nothing else. I think it can start to look a little spammy if people don't add any text to there comment reply but just leave a tip.
