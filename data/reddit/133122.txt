Monero isn't a scam.

You can still mine alts and sell for btc :)

No. That said, wait for the 2nd week of April.

I based that off of 2 previous posts, one yesterday and one today, that were about this that each ended up with 0 upvotes/comments. I assumed the given titles were at fault for stalling those posts. This is my best take at an attention grabbing title to see if people actually saw/cared or if it was just me.

Gemini has instant ach, but you can't withdraw until it goes through. Can get bitcoins and trade them though.

You can never blame him for being a scammer/pumper like you could pretty much every other alt creator who suggests you buy their coin. I appreciate his honesty. That said, monero is one of the only cryptos that really has real world use (or at least that potential) that you cannot get with bitcoin.

Not really at all. Yes, they discuss blockchain use cases outside of bitcoin, but at no time does anyone insinuate bitcoin it bad. It is all very much positive toward bitcoin actually. I take it you didn't watch much more than 30 seconds if that.

Did you update to the latest version?
@_date: 2016-03-24 07:18:27


This. Coinbase is the one that needs to resolve the issue. No need to piss off merchants.
@_date: 2016-03-23 16:23:10
Really? A serious question? Wow.

Only hides tx values unless I'm mistaken.

True, but bytecoin was instamined. So he took a broken crypto and made it into something worthwhile.
