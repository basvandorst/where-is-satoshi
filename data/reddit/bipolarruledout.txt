Why? That shit took less cpu power to mine than stream a porn video.
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:35:14
Because it's money backed by the largest supercomputing network the world has ever seen. And it's opt in BTW.
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:39:02
I never buy lotto. I wouldn't know how to even scratch one if it were not for bosses giving them out as "incentives". The point still stands that if you bought  $1 in BTC the day this sign was held up you'd have made a well over $1 return.
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:46:15
Indeed it is.
@_date: 2018-01-04 11:34:42
Indeed you do.
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:29:15
Those are over at this point. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
@_date: 2018-01-27 14:45:57


Not like it's a first for them.
@_date: 2018-01-04 11:39:14
Doesn't mater. The code is elegantly simplistic as fuck. It's the IDEA that maters. But I get it, hindsight is always 20/20 when you're not the one that actualy wrote it.
@_date: 2018-01-04 11:44:42
This is like criticising tcp/ip because it didn't include Facebook.
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:35:58
That's funny that Goldman thinks a half trillion is "significant". They could probably find that in the couch.
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:40:43


@_date: 2018-01-16 01:42:31
We're overdue. Might be this year, might be three years. The takeaway is that they are getting closer and closer together but The Fed is still sitting on essentialy 4 trillion in debt they need to unwind by raising rates. They have not been able to do this by any significant measure. Will they double down next time? I don't know but at some point even the poor will be too poor to bail out the rich. Either way the entire boom/bust cycle should eventually become a thing of the past as we slowly move back to hard money. Or I'm wrong and economics isn't a pseudoscience. But I believe it is. No one in their right mind would drive a car that broke down this often.
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:41:18
That gold analogy is correct but *only* after equalibrim is reached. How long did it take gold to reach equalibrim? Even if gold is only 5 trillion we still have 100k bitcoins to look forward to. Of course because gold has no ledger we don't know of much there really is. But then it's not the only store of value metal.
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:44:50
No they arn't.
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:45:12
It's not.
@_date: 2018-01-27 14:33:54
Well of course it is it's a bunch of billionaires!
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:43:04
They will be. Wait till the next banking panic...oh.. uh, sorry, I meant "financial crisis".
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:38:15

Nothing was decentralised before. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 11:42:42
None. There's a reason it's the currency of hackers.
@_date: 2018-01-27 14:42:57
Markets are stalled?
@_date: 2018-01-04 11:45:52
Not that complex.

Thank you.
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:57:27
That's a pipe dream and you know it. It would be cheaper to pull a 51% attack on bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-04 11:37:08
And they opened sourced it why?

Yeah they do. And they are morons.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:03:22
Economists seem to have the uncanny ability to talk forever while saying nothing of substance. You might as well be reading tea leaves when you read a finance report. Just look at the constant fawning over The Fed. Will they or won't they? It might as well be a soap opera. Thus I consider most esentialy useless. But that's still an improvement over supply siders so it could be worse. But I'd also remind you that we *pay* these people.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:03:11
That's completely wrong. Banks are only required to keep limited reserves and thus most loans are created out of thin air which is why inflation exists.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:03:23
Excellent analysis. They could use you over in r/economics .
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:38:59
And I'd add that data centers and NOCS keep several days of fuel on hand for redundancy and most will happily take bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:34:21
And that's not a problem for bitcoin. If a market for service is viable it will be created.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:25:50
I offered. That's all I do. Their loss.
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:29:18
Nope. Same here.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:29:49
The taxes on capital gains are minuscule anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:52:21
Hodl. Alway Hodl. Go apply for more credit if you need to. Fiat is cheap as fuck even at 25% apr. Just try not to spend it on crypto.

What do you think happen to the world if the internet went down for even a few hours? For one supermarkets would be empty.

@_date: 2017-12-03 23:38:01
 Well this is r/bitcoinmarkets territory but I'd say 20k to 100k by Q4 2018.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:17:12
I hope it's got an SSD in it.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:50:59
Like the one in 2008 that created $4 trillion balence sheet The Fed still has been unable to roll back?
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:59:34
You're going to be very sorry.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:29:11
And are you a charlatan, imbecile, or just a hack?
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:03:34
You know all the code is public right?
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:22:45
Then you will be very disappointed.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:20:20
Nice! And bitcoins are on sale!
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:34:50
Good to know.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:42:49
Oh you mean you don't have an elite team of lawyers, accountants and consultants to hide it all for you? It must suck being one of the "little people".
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:06:50
Yep. There's a reason Satoshi went off the grid.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:16:21
Keep waiting for that crash.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:54:56
Bitcoin is effectively infinitely divisable.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:39:08
That's false. The energy required remains more or less static due to Moore's Law.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:40:18
Effectively impossible now.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:39:34
If you're in the 10 or 15% bracket the tax is zero.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:47:27
Been there. And people still bitch about how long confimations take when it's still faster and cheaper than a wire.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:07:24
"Fair and balenced".
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:17:56
Not worried in the least.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:01:05
For telling it like it is? Please.
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:00:26
Excuse me?
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:19:23
Give it chance to stabilize.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:14:48
If you're in the 10 15% bracket it's zero.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:28:21
It doesn't mater. If they BTC I can buy more BTC with fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:53:52
Hilarious! I need to start watching them again.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:54:31
Look at a price chart.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:05:08
Yeah... but to increase first. So in any event you can still double your money now.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:41:15
Capital gains is by definition not income and thus OP is correct.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:57:50
God I love this guy!
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:21:26
Nope. That doesn't last forever becuase bitcoin is devoid of usury.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:27:28
If the government falls and you have no money then....?
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:49:12
Bitcoin is already regulated by the largest supercomputing network the world has ever seen.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:47:18
It is winning out.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:32:07
And in the future conventional economists will be remembered as the hacks, charlatans and imbeciles that they are.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:04:06
I'd like to see them try.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:41:14
Blockchain doesn't exist without bitcoin. Do you want the largest supercomputing network the world has ever seen controlling your finances or some two bit bank infrastructure?
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:35:09


Sure buddy.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:08:55
Because if I had as many bitcoins as he did I wouldn't give a fuck either.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:46:43
Or we could see it swing over 100k in a week.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:11:38
Thank you. This is exactly what I need to explain the early volatility of an internet based asset.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:05:43
Always love "fair and balenced" articles. /s
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:13:41
I think alts are trash and I'm not big on ETH. But litecoin will likely be what you buy coffee with.
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:54:57
Etherum could be MySpace.

Capital losses. /And yeah I lost so much money.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:09:57
Over 10 Trillion is stored offshore and everyone now knows about it. How long before that money is looking for a place to go?
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:29:55
Believe it because it's true.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:31:05
Until the dollar says "redeemable for 1 satoshi".
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:32:12
That will work great until it doesn't.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:44:50
Bitcoin is devoid of usury. This concentration will not last forever.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:12:28
Someone's been reading Taleb.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:44:23
Why do you think Satoshi went off the grid? It's not even the IRS, he's an enemy to the Federal Reserve.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:32:07
I'd like to see them try.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:02:28
Oh no the laws are fine here as well if not better...you just have to be very, very, very, very, VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY rich.
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:33:55

@_date: 2017-12-09 01:58:38
So he said nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:20:28
Bitcoin *is* socialism because it's money devoid of usury.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:41:35
You are correct sir.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:42:42

Alts *literally* don't exist without bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:59:39
Been there, done that.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:29:22
Why? Becuase you thing it will crash? Better make backups.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:02:15
We're still very early in the adoption period. Mining fees are market based and thus the big boys are willing to pay them. As coins become more distributed(and they will because large holders sell) this will start to become less of an issue. If it's a big deal then don't pay a large fee. Transactions will still confirm just not as fast. Bitcoin is still faster than ACH and far cheaper than a wire. Eventually many vendors will likely offer a discount for bitcoin if they don't already. This idea that we need to actively advocate adoption is silly. Bitcoin has already been wildly successful as evidenced by it's ever growing market cap.
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:35:03
They have no merit period because the entire dichotomy is based on the idea that entropy and the second law of thermodynamics don't apply to them. It's the very definition of pseudoscience.
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:39:45
That would be a sony memory stick. Buy a USB reader that supports it. Shouldn't be more than $20.

@_date: 2017-12-02 17:34:48
Go over to r/economics, they ❤ shitty reasoning.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:35:53
Well they have to find you first and I have no assets so...
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:17:22
And they should. The market cap is minuscule.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:33:17
No they couldn't because demand simply raises the price. But I really hope they try.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:35:16
Hard? Well I'd better get some fiat ready.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:06:21
Indeed. And the messages can be redundantly stored for all time.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:41:23
Depends what happens in the mids.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:36:51
I would say theirs a definite millennial bias and they are very much anticapitalist.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:54:08
Not really. It will take acouple decades until the last bitcoin is found.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:11:41
Or does he merely pose to avoid the eventual guillotine?
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:45:36
If you're not using multiple exchanges and banks then you've not been playing long enough.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:20:08
Capital loss carry overs.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:02:18
I don't know.... maybe you'll need a new pair after you shit yours?
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:47:59
But not their own facts.
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:16:11
Technically you'd want more than one with multisig.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:06:25
It's not literally dangerous merely to the powers that be.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:40:58
It's a nessesary evil. It doesn't work without skin in the game.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:10:58
It has nothing to do with the economy, it's merely arbitrage.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:55:55
Actually RT runs a disclaimer before his show.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:14:57
A currency. It functionally acts like gold but unlike gold the actual supply of any holder can be instantly verified by anyone. This eliminates the problem of "paper gold".
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:29:16
Good luck with that.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:00:11
You have nothing to worry about. Capital losses, they owe YOU money.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:14:15
Alts are shitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:48:13
This has all played out before. Hodl. If I had I would be paying cash for a house right now.
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:42:38
In fairness they arn't at ALL comparable.
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:54:49
People have asked me, "You know what you're doing, can you hold it for me?" Nope.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:40:56
That would be effectively impossible as anything can be traded for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:28:57
Enter the stonewalled Federal Reserve report that everyone dismissed.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:45:06
Fiat is far worse.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:43:20
Many do not understand what that word means.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:58:42
There's like 350 million of us dude and I've got no assets.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:58:08
Until it doesn't.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:43:15
Wrong. That can't be done until they are 18 otherwise it's merely a trust they have no control over.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:11:58
I like litecoin for small transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:21:35
Finance people don't know what to make of it. There's literally no other asset of it's kind in the history of the world. And Krugman like any other economist is an imbecile. Read anything by Talab.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:46:13
Because fiat currency is too bad to be true. See also: inflation.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:44:49
Barring the fact the one is effectivly infinitely divisable.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:02:46
This is a demographic and not a percentage judgement. Don't confuse the two.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:31:33
The entire point is that loans are no longer required with deflationary currency because prices return to steady levels.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:13:02
The guy has never been wrong and I've been watching him for years.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:56:06
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:09:46
Incorrect. Bitcoin is devoid of usury and thus rent seeking will cease to exist.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:30:10
Go back to r/economics please and maybe they can throw some more QE to the rich.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:55:15
As long as we don't see 2k I'm fine with that.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:45:50
How large is the blockchain right now?
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:46:45
Can you build a stable economy on credit?
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:57:27
But only one is correct unless you believe in alternative facts.
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:26:03
Considered it in 2013 and didn't.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:24:09
Hard to criminalise a brain wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:30:30
The dollar has *always* fluctuated.... downwards.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:19:19
Not immediately. That's not how bitcoin is designed, it will take a couple decades before the last coin is mined.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:07:39
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:07:19
No they won't they can join their enemy or die. Pick one.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:09:33
See Mt. Gox.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:34:21
You have no idea how much money they have to play with. Even a trillion dollar market is couch change and we're only at a few hundred billion.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:43:25
More specifically the West wanted the middle east on usury based currency and central banking. So while it was kind of about oil is was more about the dollar.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:30:59
Well then they owed ME money for capital losses.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:27:07
In fairness bitcoin will mostly be creating thousandairs, millionaires and very few billionaires. And because bitcoin is devoid of usury all this wealth is highly fleeting. Bitcoin eventually flattens wealth disparity becuase once you spend it or sell it for worthless fiat it's gone. Those in r/bitcoinmarkets will be the ultimate losers because they are still stuck in the fiat paradigm and still see it as a get rich quick scheme rather than a get most richer scheme and a get the .01% poorer scheme.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:20:01
Sorry but the "fair and balanced" argument only works on Fox news.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:37:59
This is why I'm not that worried.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:56:43
False analogy. Trees are physical in nature, bitcoins are not. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:49:37
You have no idea. Over 100 billion have been created seemingly from thin air faster than it took Bill Gates.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:16:59

Because they track cash moving which is the most effective way to buy and trade. If you trade seashells for BTC then they have no way of knowing. But that's also why it can't be stopped, you can trade anything for bitcoin and people do it everyday on Openbazar and darknet markets.

Disappointing. The important points regarding bitcoin are scarcity and trust. These really need to be nailed to new users. The technology is really the least exciting aspect.

I don't consider this a problem because you can "self decentralize" at anytime. And it's easy to do so. No one "bank" has any unfair competitive advantage over another.  The *unfair* part is key. That requires regulatory capture but bitcoin is immune from regulation so this will never be successful.

You're missing the point. Fiat by nature creates boom and bust cycles because you can "print" it at will. It was sold as a more "stable" system. It's anything but, it's in fact completely *unstable*. 
So back to your question. A bitcoin financial system will never *need* to be bailed out nor should it be. Even so it would be impossible because you can't "print" bitcoins. You would have to confiscate them for any type of bail out.

Hundreds of trillions. And that's just *dollars*. 
People aren't used to these numbers. I spell them out because it's faster than typing all the zeros. 1 trillion is 1000 billion, 1 billion is 1000 million. 
Actually there's several metrics that are thrown out including M1, M2, and M3. I'm not being precise on this but economists tend to place cash in M1, liquid bank account in M2, and dollar denominated assets in M3.  M3 being by far the largest while the others are much smaller. Those who concede that bitcoin could overtake some of this dominance suggest that only M1 or perhaps M2 are applicable. I don't agree with this. There's no reason assets can't be denominated in bitcoin as well.  
To put this into perspective bitcoin need only capture a tiny fraction of 1% of the money supply in order to gain easily 20x it's current value.  It can easily capture far more but the main argument is time frame. The data very much suggests that "outlandish" figures are not unrealistic. This could happen quickly in a matter of months or it could take years. In case math is not your strong point then $300,000 bitcoins mean only a trillion dollar or so market cap. 
There's *a lot* (as in a metric fuck load) of money in the system. Bitcoin is currently nothing, mere pocket change and dollars aren't the only game in town, far from it.

@_date: 2014-12-05 12:34:03
Lots. As in hundreds of millions, perhaps billions.  Likely far more than is typically quoted because this would cause systemic market effects across the board. High demand causes high prices. The demand is not anywhere *near* this high right now which is where these low ball figures of under a billion stem from. Furthermore a 51% isn't likely be very effective. One should expect the liquidity to quickly flow out into a different crypto such as litecoin and then they have to start the attack over with script thus the bulk of their "investment" becomes wasted. Thus cryptocurrencies cannot be killed.

They may have the fab capacity but they have a major disadvantage when it comes to electricity which only appears competitive due to massive government subsidies. It's speculated that this is the reason that most mining is done in the US despite the ASIC's coming from China. China already has a voracious appetite for power and adding to current demand will not help the situation. Yes, they have vast energy reserves but they also have a labor shortage which is an additional input which would like drive prices higher.

There's red flags a plenty. First they don't say how many total coins can be mined. Second of all the premine needs to remain in reserve. The fact that a premine reserve exists *virtually* guarantees it's failure. If they never "spend" it it's fine. But if they never spend it then it doesn't need to exist in the first place. It *might* work if speculators pour liquidity in. 
They "good" thing is they are tossing a bunch of coins (albeit nearly worthless) at the community. The bad thing is that they will try to flip these on the fiat market and contribute to the devaluation of the coin. I would recommend extremely strict spending policies to prevent this but those still won't work. 
There's no free lunch. These premine schemes are only slightly better than inflationary coins in that the only good thing is that the "inflation" is capped. It makes those holding the coins their own worst enemy but *only* if they truly intend to hold the coins otherwise it's a pump and dump.  So why not just use an inflationary coin? The idea is that there's some kind of "magic" formula that will inflate it "just enough" but not *too* much. 
Premined coins: We reserve the right to steal *some* of your money but you won't know how much this is until we actualy *do* it but trust us. 
Inflationary coins: We're only going to steal some of your money but it will be at a set, predictable rate. 
*Neither* are without risk. They both require trust in the party of issue. The problem is that trustworthy people that have nothing to gain don't require your trust. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 06:46:19


No it's not. Wealth disparity is expressed in percentage of total holdings, not an arbitrary number. People need to forget about dollars. Dollars are irrelevant to the subject. One's *percentage* of total wealth in coins can only decrease, not increase because each new coin mined decreases the percentage of a single parties holdings. This will continue well beyond the next century. Thus if you start with even 10% of the wealth you will end up with less than 5%, perhaps even less because you will inevitably spend much of it. The concept of "investment" only exists in the domain of fiat currency. The only *real* value in the bitcoin paradigm is real physical resource and labor contribution. The fiat arbitrage will not last forever. Once it ends there's no sitting on your ass collecting money, also known as usury. Usury only exists in a fiat domain.

This makes sense except for the fact that wires are taking 5 days when they should be taking just *hours*. It sounds like someone is floating your float! 
Beyond that I'd say that demand anticipation needs to be better if you want to minimize your float and maximize your investment. That is to say that you have rolling orders everyday or every every few hours so that the coins your buying today are slated for sale as they arrive. This also should allow you to smooth market prices. Granted this doesn't allow you to accommodate demand surges as well but I'd say that if you're buying only once a week your not maximizing your float *or* coin liquidity very well. 
Of course there are business trade offs either way and of course you need startup liquidity before you can track future demand, I'm merely suggesting that you could run a very successful operation with far less long term investment. This is exactly how Dell and Walmart operate, the only difference is that they do it with physical inventory rather than virtual.

I would caution anyone looking to live the high life on bitcoin because at certain point it reaches market equilibrium and stops gaining value in comparison to fiat. This won't happen for a while but when it does the arbitrage is over and it's impossible to collect interest on bitcoins. At that point you have a static store of wealth which means you had better spend it wisely.

What's your risk profile? In general you should follow high risk investment advice which sets various suggested limits depending on age but there are exceptions. Sometimes if your assets are *lower* and your age is higher than 20% is recommended (that is go *higher*). Most portfolios recommendations say 10-15% max high risk investments. 
But there are no rules here and financial advisers tend to be full of shit. If their advice was *really* that good then wouldn't they have to used it to get rich and retire already instead of helping your (comparatively) broke ass do so?
How much can you afford to lose? I personalty feel that bitcoin is a surer bet than anything else you're going to come across in your lifetime. I have various reasons for this but you best explore them yourself because *I* could also be full of shit. If I had this kind of money I'd probably throw in at least 70% but that's because I'm pretty frugal and could live comfortably on the rest for a couple years or so. But most people with these kind of assets couldn't live on that for more than a few months. For you that's going to depend on your bills, income, and other assets and liabilities. 
We tend to believe that bitcoin will change the world. If you don't understand exactly how and why bitcoin will change the world than you best tread lightly. Fully understanding these aspects will change the way you think about money and perhaps even your present lifestyle and mode of living.

It's not possible to do fractional reserve banking with bitcoin. It would create giant market distortions which would quickly indicate insolvency. The is exactly what happened with Gox. The price quickly ran away from the market as a whole. In addition it would be futile to try and pay interest interest on bitcoins due to the lack of equilibrium. If/when the price spikes the amount owed back would greatly exceed the principle by orders of magnitude. If/when the price decreases the "bank" would never be able to derive a profit. The entire point of hard money is to render usury obsolete because loans are inherently unstable. There are two suckers in every loan, one that thinks they will be able to pay back an obligation with resources that might not exist and another that thinks that it will not only get this principle back but a *profit* on top of it. The instability is created by the fact that the future is unpredictable. Even risk models are unpredictable which is why bank failures continue to happen. Because you cannot eliminate moral hazard a system that allows it will always be unstable.

That's not the point. Every bitcoin purchased deflats the dollar (Even more than now.) More bitcoin adoption means lesss reliance on the dollar. If nobody wants dollars anymore then they can't make any money loaning them. Furthermore you can't make money loaning bitcoins because you have to loan *actual* bitcoins, you can't just print them out of thin air.

There is no fast *and* cheap. If you want fast use localbitcoins which is particularly useful if you want a *lot* of coins fast. If you want a small amount fast at a reasonable fee (3%) use a debit or credit card on circle. If you want a large amount cheap then use a ACH broker like Celery, Circle, or coinbase. You'll have to wait for your bank account to verify but the fees will be low. It could take up to a week and a half to get your first coins, subsequent purchases are 2-4 business days depending on your bank. *Some* sites offer Yoodle account verification which allows you to verify your account same day for ACH transfer, notably Celery and Coinbase. This will allow you get your first coins in as little as 2-4 business days (again depending on your bank). Credit unions are generally faster.

I'd have to read the arguments to comment. One thing I will say is that even bitcoiners have misconceptions about bitcoin. Particularity day traders but probably miners as well. If you're in bitcoin to become *fiat* rich you're doing it wrong. The very success of bitcoin will devalue fiat and thus you aren't doing yourself any favors by holding it.  
The second misconception is that you will be able to "strike it rich" and then maintain a type of "investment" return in perpetuity. The bitcoin holder will not maintain their wealth via usury but by the (formally) tried and true method of prudent, conservative spending, and saving. This is because the early gains of bitcoin are due to arbitraging fiat. 
Once market equilibrium is reached the exponential gains will stop and the goose will be no more, only the golden eggs will remain. Many won't realize this and turn to conventional financial markets to try and have their cake and eat it too before discovering that the usury paradigm is coming to a close. 
Much of this new bitcoin wealth will be squandered but that's a good thing because it spreads the coins around in the economy. Over the long term it's not bitcoins exchange rate that maters to ones wealth but the number of actual coins (and/or fractions). In this way wealth disparity will slowly correct itself especially with the introduction of newly mined coins. These are important concepts for newly wealthy bitcoin holders to understand.

I'm a bit confused about that. If this is the case then surely they have a limitation how much coins you can buy instantly. I mean if you buy one "instant" coin a day that's a 30k liability per month, what if you're card is only good for 5k or so? 
Yes it *does* limit their liability somewhat but not *that* much is all I'm saying.

It's only printed on checks (the first number at the bottom left). Also your account number is not the same as your debit card number (the number on your card is only for visa or mastercard transactions). Check your banks web site or just call them for the routing number and also your account number.... which is usually printed on your statement but note that for security reasons they are obscuring it more often. Sometimes it's faster just to go into a branch, a teller can give you both of these. 
Note that the above only applies to ACH (check) transactions which are cheaper but slower than debit or credit card transactions. If you don't need the bitcoin right away then use ACH.

It's kind of impossible to calculate. Bitcoin is an international currency so it's not arbitraging *just* the dollar but every currency, dollars just happen to be one of the biggest players.  You kind of have to start by looking at The Fed M1, M2, and M3 numbers. I happen to think it can canibalize all these but some people only count M1. 
These are really economist questions which all hate hard currency anyway so while they could likely provide a good answer they won't because they disagree with the dichotomy to begin with.  
One thing they can't disagree on is that everything reaches equilibrium so the value is somewhere around the sum of both bitcoin and M1 divided in a certain amount by the two. If bitcoin even takes 1% of M1 then you're looking at an extra 28 billion or so in bitcoins market cap, well over a couple thousand dollars. 1% M2 is a 114 billion added to the market cap. You do the math. 
These are conservative projections. The numbers only get *bigger* the more data you add in. There's hundreds of trillions of dollars in the world. 1 trillion dollar market cap for bitcoin is not out of the question and could be considered quite small. 
Ah.... but what about the dollar? Well 1% inflation isn't that much is it? But that's if we're being really conservative. *Significant* devaluation only comes with giant value projections on bitcoin, well into tens or even hundreds of trillions of dollars market cap.  Note that since these numbers are only taking USD into account they are further low balled.

1. Circle takes credit cards. 
2. Circle offers better rates. Exchanges generally aren't economical unless you're buying large amounts (several thousand dollars) since they cater primarily to investors and traders.   
3. Very few exchanges will take bank transfers at all, some won't even take wires. (which *themselves* are expensive, inconvenient, and require a bank visit) Most also require very heavy levels of verification which requires sending ID,  proof of residence documents, etc. Again this is slow and can take weeks.

Makes since. ALWAYS use 2FA! You don't even need a cell phone account to use it. You just need an android device, it doesn't even need an internet connection after you load the software. Use your tablet or get a cheap, used android device on ebay. There's also PC based 2FA software if you have anther PC like an old laptop or something around.  
Second protect your e-mail account with 2FA *also*. Strong passwords are helpful but they still won't protect you as well as 2FA will, not even close.

Admittedly it's threatening to *both* at least under the assumption that welfare must be paid for via money creation. This isn't necessarily the case despite that it tends to be in practice. But that's beside the point.
Consider the better explanation (supported by Piketty) The fiat system is designed (or at least in practice) to create wealth disparity via usury. Wealth disparity breeds poverty. Fix the system and the problem fixes itself.... albeit not immediately but at minimum it prevents it from becoming worse. 
In this since I think the libertarians have it right. The problem is that libertarian policies don't work at all in the fiat system and likely make the problem worse with the assumption that upward mobility would increase if there was less welfare. 
In the real world we have a complex hybrid system stemmed from incumbent wealth control which is the source of the "corporations are evil" mantra. In reality they're probably more big than evil. But how did they get big? Success? Hard work? Sure but there's also a good amount of regulatory capture going on including banking which is probably the biggest one of all. 
In the end I believe it's not government or the "welfare state" but the monetary system but if one chooses to ignore this dichotomy in favor of a status quo fiat system then these are perhaps valid culprits. We can't stop "corporations from being evil" because that assumes they will still have the capacity but will somehow choose not to. We can make it impossible for them to do so by removing the power of usury.

The problem for the rich is the "reverse bank run effect". The more they buy the more expensive it gets to the point that you end up with a far lower number of bitcoins than you would have if you had bought fewer. And according to /bitcoinmarkets the amount needed to increase the price significantly is rather low. 
That is to say the richer one is the less rich they will remain by converting to bitcoin. It's safe to say that at this point the winners are already spoken for. Even the richest person in the world will never be able to afford the number of coins that Satoshi holds for example.

The one thing you're missing is that there's zero rationality in the market supporting a centrally controlled coin. 


You said so yourself. How do you make yourself rich with a centrally controlled coin? You don't. It doesn't mater how technically superior it is. What makes an iPhone valuable is not the same as what makes a currency valuable. 
The market will simply not adopt a coin that has even the slightest possibility of being controlled or premined. Inversely there's no money to be made in a "technologically advanced" decentralized coin. That coin is already here. That coin is bitcoin. 
The very idea that you can make money off a currency is appalling to the public. We've been there, done that. And if your retort is that tons of people are "making money" with bitcoin that's a false argument. They aren't. Any appearance to the contrary is merely fiat arbitrage and that game ends as soon as equilibrium is reached. Strictly speaking they are "making money" off of the weekness of fiat, not off bitcoin. You are confusing this concept with usury which hard currencies including bitcoin do not allow. 
Any company who thinks they are going to profit off a new currency needs to remove the paradoxical idea that they can create a deflationary currency while still profiting off it's usury. It's not going to happen.

I've come to the conclusion that the only way to fully embrace libertarianism is if you embrace free (as in freedom) money. This can't be merely part of the libertarian platform but a *prerequisite*. Without this requirement being met nearly every other idea is rendered absurd. This reason is that it's the only solution to eliminate regulatory capture. 
In general both liberal and conservative ideas concede that the money supply will always be centrally controlled and thus are building from a flawed dichotomy. Of course in actuality the road to free money is a long one and thus a hybrid of ideas all have merit until the day 100% free money can be assured.

Well here's the thing. The spread is really only in a single direction. Once a network of ATM's spread you're likely to see the same fee charged in network for a full cash transfer due to the increased physical cash economics. That is to say that only cash going in or out (not both, only one) is more expensive while the other is less expensive.  That's an advantage to the ATM operator who will always have one of two problems: Either too much cash or not enough cash. This is why supermarkets never charge you for cash withdrawals on debit purchases. It cost them *less* money to simply give the cash out free because they have too much of it. In fact this may actually give ATM operators incentive to charge *less* for these transactions rather than more depending on which way the market is moving.

The problem with these projections is they discount the vast secondary market effects that more than DOUBLING demand would have. When demand rises supply goes down and prices go UP. If someone is planning a 51% attack then you're going to see a surge in prices which will drive up the cost of it. Expect prices across the board for chip fabrication and silicone wafers industry wide to balloon. There would be wide speculation just as there is when Google decides to build a hush hush data center. Just an *attempted* 51% attack would make headlines before it even starts thus putting miners and the entire community on notice. Furthermore data centers don't build themselves or go online overnight.
But lets say they pull it off? What then? Well then the invisible hand of the market steps in to deliver an epic bitch slap as liquidity drains out of bitcoin overnight into some other crypto (presumably litecoin) and they've just wasted hundreds of millions on ASIC's. Time to start over with script. 
This fact *alone* is why it's good to have other alts in the market. The fiat has already entered cryptos and it moves freely and instantly with nearly no friction. The nature of crypto markets means that anyone attempting a 51% attack had better be prepared for a giant game of whack a mole. Thus they're going to have to be a lot more agile and have a lot more hardware and even then it's going to be an impossible game to win as miners and datacenters start kicking them to the curb. Large institutions aren't agile. They don't move quickly, the hive mind (for lack of a better term) does. There's thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of us and very few of them.  
A 51% attack always makes great fun for skeptics to pontificate but in the real world it's just not very feasible because it simply can't be done in an organic fashion which goes undetected.

There's really no excuse for the website breaches. The rest I'd considering "internal" given that there are at least some physical (human) protections on top of these systems which are generally used by "trusted" participants. Of course I use that word lightly. Any wage slave can do untold damage with just rudimentary knowledge. How protected are POS systems to start with? Not very. I would think it fairly trivial to attack any system over USB. If that's not enough one merely needs a screw driver if they want physical access to the hard drive. Need network access? It's probably pretty trivial to plant a raspberry pi somewhere in the building. In short companies aren't taking data security seriously or thinking that the dozens of threat vectors available don't apply to them because they only hire "stupid" minimum wage employees.

This applies to very few. 


There are pros and cons to this. Bitcoin's policies are meant to minimize confusion and bariers to entry for customers while still offering decent fraud protection. Even this is not perfect. 4k a month is pretty high amount to secure against with just a credit card which may or may not have the credit required to back this amount. This still allows one to buy 52k a year with zero wait time and the most competitive fees around. If you need instant access to more bitcoin liquidity than this then coinbase is not for you. 
Second of all by explicitly selling bitcoins with credit cards it opens up coinbase to to many downsides. The first is high fees, some of which may be billed to customers by card companies as cash advances. Second of all these high fees make bitcoin looks expensive and inaccessible. Third they open up coinbase the the scrutiny of both credit card companies and high rates of fraud abuse which further exasperates fees to customers and strain bank relations. Again you are not the target market, there are niche markets for this such at BTCquick with both high fees and very high verification requirements.   
You're simply not going to find a service that offers both fast transfers with low fees and low verification.

Human legal constructs are still imposed on bitcoin. You can have cheap bitcoins but with higher verification and wait times (coinbase) or high prices with low verification and high speed (LBC) or somewhere in between (circle debit/credit cards).  
The wallet situation is similar. Wallets allow for off blockchain transactions which give you speed in transacting but at the expense of risking trust. I believe off blockchain transactions will be big and they *should* be as to minimize strain on the network. Your morning coffee for example doesn't need to be on the blockchain.  Some retailers will likely only accept transactions from certain wallets but in return will give you instant transactions and perhaps benefits like store rewards, etc. (I don't anticipate bitpay taking the risk of double spends forever, they might encourage the use of their own wallet). On chain transactions will likely remain for large wallet fills and transactions deemed high risk. But this is all great because it gives users *choice* which is what truly free financial markets are about! 
@_date: 2014-01-30 13:21:12
I didn't hear any numbers or personal information being exchanged. 
What this indicates to me is that the coins sold are currently above the price sold at. Furthermore the account was in fact "balanced" according to OP. From the looks of it OP does not have a legitimate financial loss and thus should probably have not requested a charge back from his credit card company. The only thing I'm seeing here is the customer was ticked off for the error and wants some kind of compensation above and beyond what should be given for their "inconvenience". As far as requesting a charge back I'm not suggesting the customer should not have called their card company but this could certainly be seen as a hostile act depending on the context.

Wealth disparity exists now, bitcoin can't immediately repair that. It only insures that  wealth disparity does not *increase*. That is to say that the large holders of bitcoin will not retain their holdings on a *percentage* basis due to the mining of additional coins. The percentage of coins they own necessarily goes down by the day. Bitcoin will eventually reach equilibrium and when it does usury will be destroyed as a vehicle for wealth creation as it should be. Thus the wealth of the rich will eventually *decrease* as they spend it. If they spend too much they might eventually have to work. Their kids (or their kids kids) will most  definitely have to work.

This would be interesting experiment if they started with a fiat fund and an amount of freely distributed coins *then* used the fund to gradually "pump" the currency. But even *this* might not work. 
If they think they're just going to send it out at $1.25 then it's going to fail big time. Cryptos need to be built from scratch and they actually *benefit* from speculation in that it's speculators that pump up the currency *provided* that they don't sell but none the less it's a zero sum game because it's deflationary. That is the speculators that *lose* (and some will) are the ones that add value. 
From an economic perspective cryptos gradually redistribute wealth so they *can* alleviate poverty but only if the community as a whole has a high wealth disparity (A few or a lot of rich people that refuse to spend any of their money). If that disparity is already rather even or everyone is already impoverished then it won't work. 
OK so why has bitcoin been so successful you ask? Because  as a world currency it benefits from hundreds of trillions in fiat chasing it's "minuscule" 10 billion market cap.  There are a lot of very, very, very, *very* rich people in the world that have so much money that as of yet they don't notice the immeasurable fiat currency devaluation performed by cryptos.  Besides centrals banks are already doing their worst.
Wealth does not just create itself from thin air. Arbitrage only gives the appearance of such. If you put a crypto into an impoverished community it won't do anything without a large wealth pool to arbitrage off of. Assuming otherwise pumping *real* liquidity into it can help bootstrap it but even *this* will run out of steam without a large wealth pool.

They like to "float" your money for an extra day or so so they can collect interest off it. I've found credit unions to be much faster, next day isn't unusual.... but still slow. The way ACH works is they batch all the transactions and run them at the end of the day when everything is more or less "off line" and the daily activity is already reconciled. If you want something faster then you have to use a wire which still isn't instant. It's expensive because a whole group of people basically runs around updating, checking and rechecking a bunch of ledgers. It's slow because it relies on people who need to take breaks, get coffee, go to lunch, etc. That's what I'm told anyway. I've never got a great answer for why this couldn't have been automated like a couple decades ago other than that their systems are so bad and antiquated that it's effectively impossible.

@_date: 2014-01-17 22:07:30
The problem is deeper than simply a commodity/currency issue. It has to do with widely held delusional beliefs about money itself. You can only break this by teaching that fiat money is insolvent. Even then the person has to actually *believe* this. I have little doubt that many "bit coiners" themselves (especially day traders) don't even believe this and they are just "along for the ride". 
Humans also fail at the concept of time scale. They think too short term. The "bitcoin 1%" will not *remain* in this category in perpetuity because bitcoins do not gain interest. (Exchange rate increases aren't interest, it's fiat arbitrage. The difference is that interest is perpetual where as arbitrage is temporary and stops when equilibrium is reached) These people are attempting to apply fiat financial concepts to hard currency.  That is to say that the rich remain rich due to interest income (usury) which doesn't exist in the bitcoin paradigm. This misunderstanding will cause many early adopters to squander fortunes by overspending or trying to retain their wealth in obsolete fiat investments. To prevent this the world must learn to become savers again and live more like their depression era great grandparents. 
It's not the dollar value exchange rate of ones wallet that maters, it's the *percentage* of the market cap they hold. This percentage will only go *down*, not up. Thus the 1% cannot remain the 1% because they will spend coins and even if they don't more coins will be mined both of which pushes down wealth disparity and the wealth will naturally spread. This means that vast fortunes can no longer be passed down generation upon generation. Bitcoin exploits the human nature of greed (via spending) to keep this concentration in check. 
Furthermore bitcoin is not a bubble. It only *appears* to be a bubble because fiat is a bubble. Once equilibrium is reached bitcoins neither decline nor increase in value. 
tl:dr: Bitcoin represents a vast change in the very concept of money. Pyramid schemes themselves are a product of the fiat regime.

The problem is going to be in the area of "self censorship" with Bitpay type processors. However this opens the opportunity for businesses that operate at the state level. This also decentralizes transaction processing (which may introduce a desired level of plausible deniability) but at the expense of more complexity and expense.  
One of the worst things about the decriminalization movement is that's it's encroaching on the more "liberal" medical marijuana laws. This mostly applies in the area of taxing medical users and/or for profit dispensaries not catering to medical users. This may seem like a minor thing but a medical user could potentially jeopardize their medical use rights if they do not go through established medical channels. There could also be a product distinction. Some states are talking about limiting the potency levels of non-medical product. 
New decriminalization laws also impose new age limits on users. In Washington for example although medical users can be as young as 18 the new law still makes possession by those under 21 illegal. However the new law reads as if it completely exempts medical users but this is a mater of interpretation. Anyone involved in this industry is likely going to interpret the strictest definition of the available laws in order to protect their business. 
Of course at the Federal level medical (and indeed *any* use) remains illegal but should the long arm of the law come down on you might they be more lenient on medical users following the state law/s by the letter?

No, it *will* destroy their business model because it fundamentally changes the entire business.

They could and might give some cursory support to bitcoin at some point but it will be the beginning of the end.

The price is high because of price discovery, that is that markets have (correctly) determined that dollars have very little value.  This merely makes it *appear* that bitcoin has a high value when in fact they have neither high nor low value, their value is strictly constant until compared to a low value asset like fiat.

Restaurants and bars are especially liable to card skimming (mostly by employees) since there is ample opportunity during the time the card leaves the table and is processed. That and their clientele is usualy well liquored up by then.  
For those who don't know card skimming is done with small, portable card skimmers which are small magnetic card scanners with built in memory to store card information. Later the memory holding all the card data can be used for fraudulent purposes. 
Credit card companies usually freeze the cards of *every* customer having been at the restaurant within a set period of time when skimmer fraud activity is detected. Customers often only find out when they go to use their card and they find out it's been canceled. Upon calling their card company a new card is issued. Obviously this is major pain in the ass for travelers who often can't use their card the rest of their trip.  
It should go without saying that if you travel (even just regionally) always have multiple forms of payment. The very act of traveling *itself* often sets off fraud alerts with card companies but at least in this case rarely do they have to reissue the card.

More importantly will the university refund your tuition if he turns out to be wrong? 
The real issue at hand is his faith in fractional reserve currency. *That's* the one you have to crack. Bitcoins best comparison is to gold but even that falls short because bitcoin isn't shinny and gold can't be transmitted over the internet. (Gold *might* have better divisibility but that fact is dwarfed by it's difficulty of physical movement.) The only reason bitcoin could not have been a currency until now is quite *literally* the fact that bitcoin didn't exist until now. 
The very best explanation I've found is summed up at this blog below. If/when bitcoin is "successful" (however it's defined) it will be because everything that academics have claimed to know about the theory of money is wrong. Of course they could still claim that bitcoin is *still* doomed to fail. (Seriously, I read one post in who claims it will fail in about 2 decades! Most industries would call this wildly successful but that would be confusing bitcoin with a stock, it's not.)  
Now in fairness the same argument might also apply to the as yet failed prediction of ~~fiat~~ dollar hyperinflation and thus collapse. But the difference is that we have a rich history of fiat currencies failing where as cryptos have *no* history but that *alone* still makes their track record better. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 08:13:32
Bitcoin isn't a stock, it's a currency. The only thing it can be judged by is other currencies. The "price" of bitcoin will become irrelevant when fiat does. If/when a dollar becomes functionally worthless most won't refer to the "price" of bitcoins just like they don't refer to the price of a dollar today.

The money was indeed created from thin air. Otherwise you need to explain why the account/s was never balanced and why charges were never filed. You also need to explain why the "fraudulent" accounts were never closed by the bank. In a court of law theft by definition requires evidence.

My guess is that anyone with significant holdings in formally "cheap" coins has sold most of them off a long time ago. The only reason they wouldn't is if they don't know their current value (forgotten) or they are "true believers". 
In this way bitcoin is great at exploiting human greed for the purpose of promoting wealth distribution. We see it all the time here, posts like "I've got X amount (10's or 100's) of bitcoin and want to sell it off." What do I do? 
The point is that the threshold where the fiat becomes more tantalizing then holding is rather low. They need to understand that once you sell a coin you'll statistically never get it back for less then you paid for it, probably much more.

The key is to not have a spread at all. This criticism reminds me of executives that used to request their secretary to fax over their e-mail. 
But even if you ignore that bitcoin exchange markets are more competitive because they are localized, dare I say distributed which bitcoin makes possible. Why? Because now they only have to exchange *one* currency rather than *every* currency which is what transmitters must do now. 
Sure, you have to deal with 2 exchanges, one per country but because bitcoin means no lock ins they will naturally become highly competitive. Furthermore bitcoin is *already* a global currency. Circle has already made the USD spread obsolete.

The trust model is more basic than even fraud. Ever try to use a cashiers check lately? No one will take them same day (which is the law). They want 7-14 days. So if you want to move money same day you have to use *actual* cash. I've taken out large amounts before only to take them to another bank. Last time the teller said "that's a lot of cash, we have cashiers checks". "I know but no one will take them. Sorry. Plus I'm only going a few blocks to another bank". Of course even this is risky because the police can confiscate cash for any reason at all.

@_date: 2014-01-20 08:02:36
I think they *are* short on coins but the 1 BTC issue is different. They are basically taking a big risk on instant sells (which aren't actually instant from your bank) and so they cut this back. Otherwise they are relying on your good faith (and however much credit you have on your Visa). You can still buy up to 10 and/or 50 BTC a day if you don't mind waiting 4 days. 
Now as for their coin "shortage" you merely need to look at the allowed sell vs. buy. They let you sell up to 50 BTC per day but only buy 10 (on "standard" accounts.) This suggests to me that they badly want to pay *you* money for coins because they are selling so many.... the order cancellation issue suggests that they can't keep up with demand. 
The conclusion is that anyone who wants fiat should be selling on coinbase. These are my own thoughts however.

Most which were "developed" overnight rather than over the course of years of dedicated planing (and on the back of it). I'll even conceed that some could be technically superior but at least at this point the market has spoken and it's going to be very hard to overcome the network effect.  What few flaws bitcoin does have aren't so much flaws as they are the best available option given a list of bad options. In many cases I find that people seems to want features which arn't viable from a technology or hard currency standpoint. In the real world perfect doesn't exist and never will.

@_date: 2014-01-09 19:09:55
Even if this happened it would not spell the end for cryptos. Worst case all the liquidity flows into litecoin (or something else) as bitcoin tanks *then* they would have to start over and the second time around pool sizes would decrease for obvious reasons as a mining shake up unfolds and the markets move to the new coin (or perhaps a basket). In this way alts help strengthen cryptocurrency as a whole. Thus a successful 51% attack would have to include contingencies for the takeover of nearly every alt coin and even this might not be enough because there are so many. It would be like playing whack-a-mole. The task admittedly becomes more logistical than technical. While it's true that they wouldn't need much computing power they *would* be competing with every miner on the network. It's unlikely they could pull this off especially if they intend to go the "thug" route. They would essentially be writing checks that their ASICs can't cache.

I think we should definitely try to help people to understand bitcoin but the usual "critiques" are untenable and usually rest with the current faith in the status quo financial system. That is to say that "fixing" them would be a cure worse than the disease. It's not advisable nor even possible to peg bitcoin to a fiat currency. It's not even possible to peg a fiat to another fiat! 
The fact is that these attitudes and other like it are very narrow minded and some people will never see past it even when presented with hard evidence like the current exchange rate. They will claim it's not "real" money when it's low or that it's over valued or a "bubble" when it's high. It can't be *both*. 
Bitcoin is a complex technical (blockchain) and economic (currency) tool. Not everyone is going to get it largely because it challenges their idea of what money *is* and should be. It is the first entity of it's kind to exist in the world. The price will raise, adoption will spread and these same people will continue their same false arguments. until they are blue in the face.

None of this maters. The idea being pushed is that somehow it will fizzle out if these things don't happen. The opposite is more realistic. That is that bitcoin will gain these "features" *because* of it's usefulness. 
And speaking of regulation. They can't regulate this and besides it doesn't *need* regulation. Regulation for what? Tax purposes? Existing tax laws still apply and the blockchain actually makes it rather difficult to hide *large* transactions. People will still evade taxes just as they always have, that's not going to change. 
Yeah, lots of people are going to be very pissed off but they won't be able to do anything short of shutting down the internet. Banks can try and freeze transactions but there's too many other ways to get money in. All this will do is drive up the cost of getting fiat in.

Close. It's market price is indication enough of it's "success". Adoption is merely a product of this success. It's like questioning whether a new business is "successful" based on whether it can compete with Amazon while ignoring the fact that it's already profitable. It is also suggesting that the market is irrational for patronizing said business instead of Amazon rather than assuming that the new business might be better able to compete. The idea becomes progressively more absurd as the new "business" continually gains more market share.

Not really.... but maybe. Most people don't keep that many bitcoins on hand and it takes *them* time to get cash transferred to coins as well. There's more people trying to buy bitcoins than are trying to sell. Just look at coinbase. Their default buy limit is 10 where as their default sell is 50!

That's not true. The total percentage of ones ownership goes *down* as more coins are mined. Bitcoin wealth does not beget more wealth due to the lack of usury. The only wealth to be gained is via market price discovery rather than usury. Thus bitcoin serves to decrease wealth disparity rather than increase it.

That old chestnut: 
@_date: 2014-07-20 17:11:27
Contrary to popular opinion what people think makes them happy is anything but intuitive. Money tends to make people happy but only up to a relatively low point of $75k (which admittedly may very somewhat with the market but this hasn't been definitively shown).  Anything above that does not improve happiness and may actually decrease it. High net worth individuals for example tend to experience existential dissatisfaction since money no longer is an issue but time very much is. 
Notice that the red spots tend to be high wealth ones. It's long been assumed that money just naturally makes people happy but this isn't true. On the other hand a *lack* of money can make people profoundly unhappy. Thus we need to think of wealth much differently than we have in the past.

The irony is that all the people shouting "technical shortcomings" are the least qualified to judge such a possibility. The reality is that the code isn't very complicated at all thus making it quite secure. Remember the last company that claimed "technical shortcomings" and then proceeded to lose nearly a billion dollars? That was a human shortcoming, not a "technical" one.

Selling is easy especially if you want to sell below market, just go on localbitcoins.com. Or you can send them to a coinbase account and after you link a bank account they will make a deposit via ACH. But I'd hold most if not all if you don't really need the money.

It and other alts are important as a safe haven should anything "bad" happen to bitcoin. Markets are pretty damn magical that way. There's virtually no friction in the crypto trade so should a black swan event take place any one of them could balloon up overnight as bitcoin tanks.

Technically the 5k plus 5k example is if they believe it was done specifically to evade a transaction report meaning they have to both be made (I believe) within a 48 hour period to be considered evasion.  This is gray area stuff. This stuff has a very low if not impossible chance of getting you in hot water with The Feds but it very much could with the bank. I've had respected small business owners tell me to *never* make over a 10k cash deposit and if you are you're likely taking way too much cash, not unless you're a "large account holder" which likely only applies to big box retailers or those with armored car service.

People post this divide every so often but what they fail to see is that due to spending and mining no one person can perpetually retain a growing *percentage* of bitcoin wealth. The distinction is important for it's not the value itself but the *disparity*. Hard currencies don't allow for usury. 
That means that no one can be rich forever unless they legitimately create real economic value. In actual terms this means that the rich will no longer get *richer*. At most they can only stay as rich as they are *right now*. They can of course invest that wealth into real job creating ventures but because bail outs will be obsolete they will have true "skin in the game".  While there will always be rich people there will be more of then with less wealth overall and there will also be *true* trickle down. 
"But won't some rich person buy up all the coins". They can't because the more coins they buy the higher the price goes until their fiat wealth has been completely diminished. So while they can buy in and probably will they can never control the same percentage of bitcoin wealth as they control in fiat wealth. This marks the end of old money because once a coin is spent it can never be regained with a greater than corresponding amount of real added economic value. No mater how many coins one has they eventually diminish due to their own (and their families) consumption. But that's OK since they *love* hard work and innovation so much!

Just signed up for an account. They work very much like coinbase it seems except at buy time you must supply a wallet address. They do not keep your wallet online. You must verify your Name, Address and use one verification method:
Credit Card (Instant, Up to $1.98 may be charged)
Paypal (Presumably instant) 
ACH (3-5 days like coinbase.) 
After which you can buy coins, deposits via wire transfer are same day (excluding any bank delays) but your bank will of course charge you for the transfer. Seems most banks charge about $25.00. You *cannot* make purchases via paypal for obvious reasons. They *will* however deposit dollars from coins you wish to sell to paypal..... which knowing paypal I personally would not attempt. 
ACH transfers are of course supported (3-5 days?) Fees seem extremely competitive. Their sell price (the price at which they sell coins to you at) is currently $837.39 vs $821.79 at coinbase (at the time of this writing) which seems slightly more expensive *however* this appears to be fee inclusive where as coinbase will charge you an extra 1% or about $8 in this case making their price about $829 or so. BTW *none* of this is listed on their site and was found simply interacting with it. Seems they need documentation!
So how do they stack up to coinbase?
Pros: Instant verification available via two methods. (3 including ACH) Supposedly they have a great reputation and are US based. Coins are *not* stored on their wallet. Same day buys via wire transfer without having to use an exchange. (Of course at the expense of bank fees which I've found to be about $25 per wire). 
Cons: No 2FA. This might not seem like a big deal because they don't store your coins but because your bank account and other information are linked then this presents the risk of people buying coins with your bank account. PROTECT YOUR PASSWORD! May be slightly more expensive but I suspect this is simply has to do with being pegged to a different exchange than coinbase. They *might* be cheaper at times. The whole site looks like a total "weekend job" and could use a lot more copy written by someone *other* than their lawyers. Also they have chat box I tried to use, the lights are on but nobodies home granted it's 11pm PST here. 
Overall they look promising but a lot screams "beta stage" but that might not necessarily be a bad thing. Like coinbase they claim to be hiring "key positions" soon. 
Edit: Paypal verification not instant and may take up to 24 hours.

Maybe but it depends. Yes if they convert to fiat, no if they don't. But even if they do then this is mitigated by users who buy coins to replace spent coins. This is also mitigated by the fact that increased sales should cause more merchants to retain coins rather than paying transfer fees especially as increased adoption stabilizes the exchange rate (albeit slowly). But more importantly is that more merchants means that more people are interested in retaining liquidity in bitcoin due to the utility they increasingly offer especially online. I'm not worried about this. Increased adoptions means increased utility of the currency which increases desire to hold.

A dispensary is a lot different than a legally licensed business. To start with they are non-profit which greatly reduces any regulatory requirements they might be exposed to. In general they have been give carte blanche *because* they operate a service of compassion at the wishes of the voters. That is they are generally expected to serve a very limited market, not overtly advertise, and serve a humanitarian purpose. 
This is all in sharp contrast to a retail dispensary which will very much be treated as a for profit business and be expected to apply to stricter regulatory requirements in terms of taxes, record keeping, and clientele. Because of this they will necessarily be a larger target of law enforcement just as liquor stores are now. 
The public will not tolerate transgressions from form a for profit businesses where as targeting a medial dispensary is seen as distasteful to say the least.

Theoretically it should be instant as spends always are. Payments settle instantly with credit cards because it's the *merchant* that is actually extending the credit to you.

If you're using ACH (bank transfer) then expect 2-4 *business* days. Circle currently advances you up to $500 of this *before* it leaves your account. (They may or may not change this policy now or in the future.) Credit unions usually process ACH transactions faster. Commercial banks tend to float your funds so they can make more money off them.  
If you're using a debit or credit card they should clear almost immediately.

I disagree. Technology doesn't sell products. It's their *benefit* to the consumer that does. People don't buy iPods because they think compression codecs are awesome, they buy them so they can have an entire collection of albums in the palm of their hand. 
Once you start start talking about the block chain and encryption you lose people. It's boring. Sorry but it is. And then you wonder why people wonder why they should even bother when they can just get out their credit card or use paypal or even just ripple or some other scam coin. 
It's the technology that enables scarcity and trust, not the reverse. If you focus too much on the technology then you run the risk of undervaluing what makes bitcoin truly revolutionary which is again scarcity and trust. These aren't available in existing status quo payment systems but the technology inherent in bitcoin certainly is.

It has little to do with the exchange rate other than the fact that a higher exchange rate tends to drive mining so the two are self perpetuating.  Strictly speaking mining doesn't "evolve" at all. Indeed hardware gets faster due to Moore's law but difficulty keeps profitability the same so it's effectively a wash. Incidentaly this also keeps energy use more or less static.

@_date: 2014-05-10 11:20:13
Critics of bitcoin expect a currency to be downright omnipotent and good enough to protect the user even from *themselves*, perhaps even if the user is mentally incapacitated. 
I do believe there is a healthy role for providers of wallet "transaction insurance" which act like traditional banks and provide risk assessment based on their own fee schedule. Such fees may even turn out be free if you follow the providers own implementation and security precautions. But the important point is that this should always be opt in to allow for healthy market competition. You should *still* always have the option to be your own bank.

I've thought about this a lot. Yes, there is some downward presure to sell for dollars but this is mitigated by the additional utility that added acceptance brings. That is to say that the more people who take bitcoin the more people will want to hold bitcoin. It's easier to sell bitcoin than it is to buy it so holding seems increasingly attractive.

Bitcoin actually encourages wealth distribution because you cannot earn interest on bitcoins. It's the total number of bitcoins that mater and *not* their exchange rate in dollars. As soon as you spend coin you can never get that coin back without contributing an equal or greater amount of economic value in exchange. Thus just by spending *any* amount your total percentage of coins goes down. But it also goes down as more coins are discovered. The top holders of bitcoins will eventually get poorer, not richer unless they never spend their coins in which case it doesn't mater because this behavior is deflationary. Yes, early adopters will be richly rewarded but their wealth will not be perpetual. Unlike the fiat system wealth does *not* beget more wealth. If you think it does then you're ignoring equilibrium which may happen quite fast. Any effect to the contrary is due to fiat arbitrage, nothing more. As soon as equilibrium is reached the value of your coins will no longer increase but they won't decrease either. In this way bitcoin is actually *not* a deflationary currency, it only appears to be next to an inflationary one. It's more accurate to call it a *hard* currency whose value neither increases or decreases but this characteristic is not yet apparent in the markets and won't be until the market cap *significantly* increases.

This is an excellent way to enter into a bitcoin position. Coinbase I believe allows you to set this automatically. The big advantage is that it allows you to avoid (some) price volatility.

I remember thinking in the late 90's that the "internet wave" had reached critical mass. Home computers were starting to go well below $2000. People weren't buying them to go online but as "educational tools" given the vast libraries of multimedia CD-ROM content like encyclopedias often thrown in for free. 
It was expensive to go online and the internet wasn't that big. But yet AOL was enormous and was growing exponentially. It *had* to slow down. It didn't. It kept growing. To this day I still don't understand why they went to an unlimited service model so early. They didn't have to. They could have been like other telecoms and soaked people for a bit longer (It was $3 an hour and that $3 was worth a lot more back then.) But they wanted to own the market and they did. 
The dot.com crash is what most people think of when they think of that era. What they forget is the other success stories. Amazon for example was a complete joke in the financial press. They literally bled cash for years. Then there's facebook and twitter but these are all at a disadvantage because they are centralized. 
The point is that bitcoin is post conception but pre adoption. I don't think we've seen anything yet. If bitcoin has any indication of dying I've not seen it. Where's the evidence? Where's the revolutionary crypto eating it's lunch? When I see one hit the three digit mark I'll reconsider but I haven't yet.

Economics is a great comparison to the scientific racism that existed during slavery. It basically amounted to lots of sham pseudoscience to suggest ("prove") that slavery was not only a just but a compassionate endeavor toward the "lesser race". In this case just substitute the "lesser race" with anyone who doesn't have an economics degree. 
Calling economics a science is an insult to anyone who practices *hard* science. Furthermore *real* scientists are not exempt from the second law of thermodynamics. When a thief goes and robs someone at gunpoint most people call it theft. Economists call it a business strategy. The main difference is that they don't use guns, they use Jeti mind tricks.

Getting rid of proof of work would mean centralization. The mining process is designed to prevent monopolization by one party. It's not bitcoin itself that's "wasteful", it's human nature that is. If we collectively decided that we were only going to allow each person to mine their "fair share" of coins then stop the difficulty would be comparatively low. But this would never happen because there's always some greedy bastard that can't be trusted. Thus the protocol prevents this by forcing one to have "skin in the game". 
Deflation further exploits this greed for good in that people with large amounts of coins naturally "sell" these coins or exchange them in commerce. (See the 10 million dollar pizza). If you want to see what happens without these mechanisms in place then look at doge coin. It was practically designed to fail as a viable currency.  Difficulty is a nessesary evil in an evil world. It gives the currency trust. If you could print it like a piece of paper it would have no trust since anyone could easily make more. Money should be a strict representation of labor and resources both of which are scarce in the real world. The protocol and the market successfully accomplish this goal.
There was actually a paper on bitcoin sustainability that found that bitcoin was far more sustainable than any other form of money. More importantly it's expected to get more energy efficient in the future, not less. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 00:11:23

Sorry. While I generally agree with Zerohedge the author is clearly off base. 


Wrong. These aren't consistent in a fiat regime as we see with land. In reality under a bitcoin regime there's a period of price discovery and then stable prices. Prices are nether inflationary nor deflationary. Just like the bitcoin itself. (Note that bitcoin only *appears* deflationary because no equilibrium has been found yet.)  


And then we get back into econ 101 shit. Too much demand? Prices simply rise. No "fatal flaw" here. 
Oh course banks don't like this because they can no longer charge exorbitant interest rates for inflated goods. They'll have to actually do something they're so fond of telling others to do: Work for a living.

I hate to say it but this is already as good as it gets. The point of a currency is that you move all your cash into it and get paid in it. Then you won't *need* an exchange. In short this is an issue that solves itself with increased adoption..... including merchant adoption. It's happening. More fiat is moving into bitcoin than moving out.

PoS has monetary implications as well. It creates an unfair distribution of money based on usury (rent seeking) and thus people are not likely buy into it.  In addition in PoW systems and fiat systems money begets more money irrespective of market conditions.

Yes it will. 


No one will stay in a currency continually losing value against another currency continually gaining value. That would be irrational. 


There is no need for debt when prices are deflated to levels that are affordable without debt. 


The blockchain does not require trust thus impropriety is impossible. 


Banks will not be able to compete against free market currencies. Banks are only needed today because people lack the tools to secure their own assets. 


See the above point. 


Bitcoin ends usury because you cannot collect interest on bitcoins. Wealth disparity exists because money works harder than labor. Bitcoin makes money not "work" at all, it is merely a place holder for labor and resources. When bitcoin increases in value this is not interest income, this is market arbitrage. Once equilibrium is reached this will no longer be a wealth increasing vehicle. Furthermore the amount of bitcoins one buy today no mater how many will be less as a percentage of the total held tomorrow. Thus wealth no longer exponentially increases. Spending this wealth will further decrease ones share. Gaining more bitcoin thus requires either work or liquidating other asset sources. Wealth is no longer self reinforcing as it is in the fiat paradigm. 


Because bitcoin stops concentration of wealth at the top this problem too eventually self corrects.

Depends what you call "significant." The world isn't going to panic if fiat loses .001% (but banks will). 
Lets say bitcoins hit $100,000. That's a *trillion* dollar market cap (give or take) or about 1/3rd of M1 dollars. But M2 is like 13 trillion so together that would be 7.5 hit on the dollar.  Less than 10% dollar devaluation. Hardly apocalyptic. 
But even *that* doesn't tell the full story because bitcoin is a world currency and dollars aren't the only game in town. Factor that in and the dollar takes maybe a 2% hit. And that's a really high estimate since we don't really know how much money is in the world. It could even hit other assets like gold and thus lessen the blow to currency. 
There's a fuck load of money in the world. If every dollar in QE The Fed has pumped out since the start of their little bond buying game went to bitcoin then coins would already be $400,000 each. And they *say* QE isn't doing *anything* to the economy.

@_date: 2014-01-23 00:42:01
If you look at just M1 money supply it becomes clear that even this is an extremely conservative estimate. It means an adoption rate of far less than even 1% of the currency market. 
So what *will* bubble territory be? Lets just say that bread will be $10 a loaf and thus the entire discussion will appear comical. 
@_date: 2014-06-24 13:59:01
Not really. 
Basically it's business as usual as long as Moore's law holds out....or even if it *doesn't*. That being said energy will get more expensive irrespective of chip efficiency. This still doesn't change the fundamentals of mining when it comes to ROI however. Sure it will make it more expensive all things being equal but all things *aren't* equal since the difficulty is dynamic. 
And yes, energy prices *will* rise despite renewables. It's one of main reasons that alternative energy can compete *at all* with oil.  The assumption that alternative energy prices will decrease while demand is steadily increasing due to population growth is comical..... even more so that it will happen as long as there's still oil to be had. It won't. We'll be lucky if it simply stays the same price or even just a *reasonable* price as we increase our use of renewables. 
But none of this maters because the markets and the protocol keep everything in check. For example if energy became too expensive even despite higher chip efficiency then spend fees would increase. Same thing if Moore's law piddles out. Not even quantum computing changes the dynamic. It's *all* about the market.

I've had plenty of problems with cancellations but it gets better the longer you're a customer and by staggering your transactions. I'd recommend new users start with Under $500 buys followed by an under $1000 buy, followed by an under $2000 buy, etc. 
Yeah, admittedly this sucks and it's not at all ideal but I think they just want to make sure that your not going to call your bank and skip out on the transaction. 
Keep in mind that lots of exchanges let you just send a money order in the mail which can be done for about the same price and time length of a coinbase ACH.... but they also have verification requirements. When it comes to buying bitcoins your options are slow and cheap, fast and expensive, or somewhere in between.

First of all inflation is not possible with deflationary coins and inflationary (or "premined" coins) will never gain lasting acceptance. There may be minor exceptions to this statement but it will remain statistically correct. In this domain cryptos are a zero sum game and thus hyperinflation is not possible. 
Note however that is a long term outlook in a market that reaches equilibrium (which all markets eventually do). Currently and for the foreseeable future no crypto is a threat to any other crypto period. More on that later. That is to say that none will steal market value from each other which is really what people are concerned about. Market value is driven by each coins time on market. This is because the coins time the market determines it's value and vice versa with few if any exceptions. There are unlikely to be "better" coins since all coins are based on bitcoin and bitcoin is extensible and thus a "better" coin isn't needed. 
At present no cypto competes with any other crypto but every crypto completes with fiat because markets will always follow the path of least resistance. There are potentially hundreds of *trillions* of dollars chasing *all* cryptos. You can only lose money holding fiat. This means there's near zero equilibrium in the currency markets due to the destructiveness of cryptos. This will not change until the market caps of cryptos and fiat are more evenly distributed. If/when this happens it will make them all wildly valuable to a stunning degree. Thus there's no immediate threat to any deflationary crypto from *anything* at all. 
That being said there is a particular black swan event that could make the top cryptos tank in value but it's not really a black swan because it would foreseeable and happen before everyone's eyes. That would of course be a 51% attack or some other takeover. In that case the next coin the market deems "safest" would swallow up that coins value in a tidal wave of hyperinflation. Alts will rally as the coin under takeover tanks. 
To summarize: 
*All* cryptos gain their value from fiat, not other cryptos thus none can pose a threat to each other *until* all currency markets reach equilibrium. At that time crypto markets reach a zero sum game environment (at which point cryptos become venerable to cannibalization) but that cannot happen until fiat noticeably tanks in value, this *might* even require fiat to be hyper-inflated out of existence.  I'd say that fiat might have to lose *at least* 10% of it's value for this to become even a remotely viable problem. The crypto market *as a whole* can never hyperinflat, any appearance to the contrary is because fiat itself is *hyperinflating* but this is only temporary until equilibrium is reached.

Frankly I've never understood why people sell mining hardware at all. Clearly their motivations and justifications are quite different than the majority of the bitcoin "true believers". 
The only explanation I can come up with is that it appears less risky and more stable simply to manufacture, not to mention less capital intensive. But lets not forget that chips are already *extremely* capital intensive as it is. Even if we assume that the profit margins are very high then it makes mining look even *less* profitable then it already is considering the main input is energy and perhaps data center space which *itself* is again capital intensive. Distributed networks (and hardware) are the future and the future is now especially considering that alternative energy favors such distribution.

No it doesn't. You don't know what you're talking about. It's *supposed* to start out this way. The end result is less wealth disparity due to the lack of usury. The fiat system is *designed* to create wealth disparity via usury. We know this to be true because wealth disparity is increasing. Hard currencies have the opposite effect.

The entire point of hard currency is to eliminate the need for credit. Because the currency is deflationary the "need" for credit *itself* should be reduced or even eliminated due to ever increasing buying power. That being said this is a slow process which assumes much higher penetration.  It's the use of credit that causes financial crashes due to the systemic unreliability of establishing and estimating credit worthiness. Credit creates bubbles and bubbles pop. This "pumping and dumping" is seen time and time again in fiat economies.

Bitcoin holders happen to represent an extremely sought after demographic with relatively high education and good incomes.

The "problems" you speak of aren't really problems. First of all the fees are due to the inherent risks of the traditional banking system. Ideally this is one time process and will indeed be obsolete if/when people and businesses choose to transact exclusively in the bitcoin ecosystem. This is a side effect of low penetration and day traders who drive up exchange fees due to their demand for constant currency exchanges. 
Transfers within the ecosystem require no exchange fees other than comparatively small transaction fees. It's moving your legacy currency in and out of the ecosystem that requires large fees. This is in fact a weakness of the fiat currency system rather than bitcoin. Those who choose to embrace the new ecosystem will no longer be subject to these fees upon finally divesting themselves and by extension those who refuse to use the new ecosystem. This is a basic market place process. Those refusing to transact in bitcoin will be seen negatively in the market. But because the bitcoin system is so much cheaper this likely won't be an issue. Alternatively they may choose to keep their customers by offering discounts and incentives to make up for the fact that they *don't* accept bitcoin. Of course this will cost them more than simply adopting the new ecosystem. The bottom like is that it is strategically advantageous to accept bitcoin and disadvantageous not to. 
The security issue is already being solved mostly via 2FA. I don't call these security issues, I call them usability issues and they will be solved via developers and/or third parties. Keep in mind that the early issues people are having are due to insufficient implementation and/or their inability to understand effective implementation. The (now *truly* free) market will solve this.
I envision transparent 3, 4, 5 or *more* factor authentication in the future. Transparent means exactly that. Imagine a physical transaction with a hardware wallet or smart phone. The first authentication could be RFID of your device followed by GPS, followed by facial ID, followed by finger print, followed by pin. The technology isn't important, even bluetooth or wifi or *both* could be used in addition or separately. The possibilities are nearly endless. Even a Luddite could interact with such a system without having to learn anything. Wallet providers will become the new "banks" of today. They will provide insurance against unauthorized transactions based on risk assessment and thus refunding your money in the event of fraud. 
Low risk transactions (using the most verification methods) would be free or virtually free. Alternatively the merchant could choose to "insure" transactions themselves (thus gaining customers) via an additional level of verification which would be akin to signing up for a store card. Perhaps your shopping out of town or in a different part of town? No problem, the merchant could still "insure" you at their own expense and might be willing to because this would only be a small percentage of their transactions albeit at a slightly higher risk. On your first or second visit  they might ask you if you'd like to make this a "regular" location and provide some incentive for doing so, perhaps a discount or freebie which would cut their risk in the process. Users will be happy to do this due to reduced wallet fees but if they don't they will likely be offered a grace period by their wallet provider. 
Note that for the user this is all very granular and transparent. Merchants would be incentivised by wallet providers (the new "banks") to employ high authentication methods or subject their customers to higher fees. Merchants in high compliance would receive a higher star rating for example and gain customers by subjecting their clients (via their wallet provider) to lower fees. 
If you think all of this would raise privacy issues think again. All can be implemented using the same encryption technology used in bitcoin itself. A market place will be created for these systems but unlike today it's 100% opt in, opt out, or somewhere in between. You're not required to use these systems yourself, you can use or implement your own but by doing so you transfer the risk to yourself or your own third party transaction insurance provider.  This is the very *definition* of market freedom. 


While this may seem to be the case the reality is that these fees have been completely transparent while the fees associated with traditional banking are very much *not*. You've in fact been paying extremely *high* fees via inflation and hidden product and services fees passed on by the businesses you transact with. Visa and MasterCard (and other payment networks) have traditionally forced merchants to keep these fees hidden from customers. This effectively has forced cash users to subsidize credit card users. So effectively it doesn't mater how you transact, you're still paying fees. You just don't see them.  
The *new* ecosystem built on bitcoin (or even other cryptos) will lower all these fees or let you transparently pay them if you desire added security. What they *won't* do is force you to pay for fraud and poor business practices without your full consent. *This* is why bitcoin will be successful. 
@_date: 2014-09-05 10:32:34

They were moving so much money in fact that they had special enlarged drop boxes made just for their money launderers. Just for referance that's 3500 pallets of $100 bills. You would need Costco size warehouses and a walmart size fleet of trucks just to move it all.

Bitcoin is a fixed supply so any distribution would likely be a one time thing. I mean I guess they could distribute future profits via bitcoin but I'm not sure this is the best thing. Don't get me wrong, it's not like I'd complain but a crypto they have some kind of control over supply of seems more prudent. The question of course is how do you fairly compensate users for karma? Should the early users and thus those with lots of Karma get special treatment? Is that the best thing for an online community? I don't think anyone really has the answers to these questions. I mean you'd be changing rules mid game. It's been pretty well established since the beginning that Karma is worthless.  I hate Doge but I have to admit that it might actually be a better fit for their goals than bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-09-21 01:16:19
Nonsense. And that's an impossible to meet metric. Distribution is only a problem with inflationary currencies, not deflationary ones. The reason is that one cannot derive usury from them. Note that usury is not the same as arbitrage. The problem is that you can't win the arbitrage game over the long term since you're selling for a currency that's eventually worth less (or worthless.) Furthermore from a wealth disparity perspective deflationary currencies promote distribution because they exploit human greed... see the million dollar pizza.

There's a lot of misconceptions about fiat that make people believe that it's solvent. That's the *real* problem. Most are applying fiat concepts to bitcoin "arguments" that simple don't apply. They think that for bitcoin to be successful it need to behave like fiat. What they don't understand is that the fact that it *doesn't* behave like fiat is what will make it successful.

It wasn't *that* long ago that you could actually get a return above inflation for holding currency. In the 90's for example returns of 5% were not unusual yet no one feared "hoarding"  of dollars. Then nearing about 10% returns were seen as the pinnacle of investment strategies. Now we've moved to even less sustainable models with extremely high risk. But that's not really the point. 
There's no such thing as "hoarding". If people aren't buying something it indicates that the product is overpriced. The market naturally corrects for this by lowering prices. Remember that whole supply and demand thing? It doesn't just fly out the window because you use a different currency. Sure it sucks for *some* people but capitalism was never about "fairness". People always love it when they do well but hate it when creative destruction bites their ass. But then those with sour grapes always need a scapegoat to blame. The blame rests entirely in your poor business strategy. Always. If you can't make money then try something else or get a "real" job working for wages.

I predict this will keep happening mostly due to the ravished world economy. When you've destroyed peoples ability to make a living they turn to theft. 
It's just too easy to pull this off. Most POS systems store caches of (or can access) large databases of personal information unencrypted. All it takes is an after hours employee with a flash drive to boot up a disk imager and walk away with a giant data store. This isn't even the only avenue for theft, it's just merely low hanging fruit.  There's dozens more. Do you trust the cleaning crew? 
The worst thing is that good security practices exist but they are never implemented. Management thinks that passwords are simply good enough while ignoring that passwords don't mean shit when you can just read the database directly behind the front end. These systems are at *least* a decade behind the internet in decent security practices.

Because every bitcoin you spend ultimately lowers your wealth since you can't collect interest on bitcoins. While bitcoins are worth a lot of dollars right *now* it will eventually take a lot more dollars to buy anything of value because they're inflationary. This means that in the long term you will never be able to replace any bitcoins your spend for less than you paid for them. 
The fiat rich stay rich because of interest income. The bitcoin rich will not have this advantage which is by design. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 05:48:07
Pretty much. Gift cards have grown gigantic and their biggest detrament is the fact that they are limited to specific businesses. It's in many interests to make them less limited in order to keep monies out of the traditional banking system due to the added friction. 
@_date: 2014-01-22 04:22:21


I don't doubt that QE may have helped but the relationship is so insignifiant as to be meaningless. The very notion questions why it's not *higher* than it is right now. 


Quite the oposite. Nearly every asset *but* bitcoin is inflated. In the strict definition of hard currency bitcoin is neither inflationary nor deflationary. It merely appears deflationary when compared to inflationary assets. Thus when you let the air out bitcoin buys more deflationary assets than otherwise. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:04:49

Then you don't understand hard currency. Bitcoin actually exploits greed for the purpose of greater wealth distribution. The best example of this is those day trading for fiat, fiat which will some day be worthless. To retain their wealth it will have to be reinvested back into bitcoin in which case there's no purpose in day trading other than to obtain more coins. The problem is that this is a zero sum game in that your just as likely to lose as you are to win.

Bitcoin has nothing to do with the fiat money supply. (At least not in a crash context.) Now upon second thought *maybe* there was a gold sell off for more liquidity but the two assets can't be compared well in this context because the market cap of gold is orders of magnitude higher than bitcoin. (This however could change quickly.) Bitcoin would probably skyrocket but even in the short term it should at least stay the same because a crash does not change it's hard asset fundamentals. Bitcoin rises for the simple reason that more people are buying it than selling it. It's only rational that there would be a sell off if you believe it's current price is irrational. Many do but that belief has been proven wrong time and time again.  
@_date: 2014-10-05 04:31:15

Cryptocurrencies are not stocks. To compare them is to suggest that the market cap for US dollars can never be bigger than Apple or Google. The amount of money in M1 US cash is 10 *trillion* dollars. M2 is far higher. 
Furthermore TCP/IP is decades old. It has not been replaced by something "better" but it has been extended. The blockchain is fully extensible. Besides, economically speaking it doesn't mater if something better comes along. If something does then bitcoin will automatically capitalize the new currency just as it does with altcoins today. There's no technical reason why for example that litecoin couldn't shoot up to several hundred dollars tomorrow while leaving bitcoin worth pennies.

That's inflation, don't let economists tell you differently. This "increase in real value" is not possible nor necessary since prices will remain static. 
Even if this were not the case GDP is expected to continuously drop because we have exhausted cheap energy which is the real driver of GDP.
Bitcoin is powerful vehicle for wealth redistribution which is very necessary to correct the current wealth disparity. It will in fact make everyone richer because it will correct this disparity which is mainly known as a liquidity trap in economic terms. 
In this context a smaller government is not necessarily a bad thing. It *does* mean that the public will pay the private sector more for needed services but they will look more like public cooperatives without the influence of regulatory capture. (This is in contrast to the neoconservative agenda under a fiat regime where a smaller government deprives the public of needed services without the benefit of saving them money. "Smaller government" is merely a term for private sector welfare in this context.)
A large change will be cultural. Lifestyles will likely slow. Without debt slavery (in fact the end of debt entirely) people will not need to work as much. Because labor will no longer be as cheap the saying "time is money" will take on a different meaning. It means people will be more compelled to do things for themselves. More products will be repaired or upgraded then replaced since labor arbitrage will no longer make them artificially inexpensive. Artisanship will make a comeback because there will be less competitive advantage in economics of scale due to less financing and far smaller pools of capital to draw from. 
All of this will have positive effects on the environment but we will not be able to undo the damage we've already done. It will make the damaging effects of rampant consumerism on both the environment and human happiness extremely apparent. Many of these changes will also will also be induced due to extremely expensive energy.
But overall things will be much better because psychopaths will no longer be running things.

Same thing I got on an ACH buy.... worked when I dropped it back to 500. I suspect they capped ACH withdrawals to 500 since this is the max "instant" amount.... or they got the ACH buy amount confused with the debit/credit card max buy amount. 
@_date: 2014-07-22 09:15:45
Be forewarned. If they do they will freeze the account and you won't have access to your money until they get around to issuing a cashiers check which is usually 10 *business* days. All your pending checks, ACH's, and debits will fail. Furthermore the branch will also be unable to make withdrawals, as in *can't*, not won't.

Yes. It's not about the *amount*, it's about the *percentage*. The percentage held by any one person will continually decline due to spending and more coins being added via mining. This coupled with the fact that bitcoins are devoid is usury insures that great concentrations of wealth will diminish rather than increase as they do in fiat systems.

Sorry but there will never be a fiat transfer system that is significantly more competitive. Either you get instant transfers at high speed with high fees or you get slows transfers at low fees or somewhere in between. That has nothing to do with any particular bitcoin "stranglehold" and everything to do with bank and government stranglehold on fiat.  
The only people who have a real problem with this are day traders who are constantly transferring fiat in and out. If you're tired of doing this then sell for some other currency or asset.

If you want to pay a bill in the US the billing party needs to support ACH meaning you have to log into *their* site and enter *your* account information. Or you can write a check. Both of these take a few days so lots of companies take credit cards, even utility companies which of course costs them more money but the fees are hidden from the customer.... except when they aren't. Some charge a "bill pay fee" if you're not writing a check.

People have absolutely no concept of just how much money is in the world. Their idea of "a lot of money" stops at several million or perhaps even just hundreds of millions. If for example you ask someone what a million dollars will buy you'll get a much more accurate description than if you ask them what billion dollars or a trillion dollars will buy. We're talking about numbers so big that it's easier and faster just to type the grammatical name of the denomination rather than all the zeros.

That's not time effective. Seriously. If they tracked every $40 "fast cash" transaction (that many tend to by 1/8s  with) you'd never find anything but a few joints here and there. They want the big guys. 
With credit cards they have a whole record already made for them. It's pretty easy to track what you did that day and find out the exact location where you were. Hell, most of the time the store number is *right* on the statement. Even if it's not it's trivial to get the address.

There was once a time not very long ago (probibly in your lifetime) when you could get a 5% return on your cash. For some reason people still spent money.

Wrong. This part is very easy. The hard part is *making* users use good security practices and preventing them from using loopholes that negate these practices. The user is lazy and will always be lazy. If it was up to the user they would never use a password at all and would simply be protected by the "magic of IT". 
Unfortunately a more secure system tends to result in a less *usable* system.  There's no perfect security. The goal is to strike a balance between usability and security. If the user enters their password wrong do you lock them out for 20 minutes or 2 days?  What steps must be taken to restore access to their account? How much time and money does this cost the user and the site? Will they blame you or themselves for forgetting their password? If they get back into their account quickly then it was probably *their* fault. If it takes them a week to get back in then they will very likely blame *you*! 
As you can see none of this is as cut and dry as it seems and we've only scratched the surface. And just in case it seems like I'm blaming the user I'm not. IT needs to be far more imaginative than their users AND their hackers. It's not just about flipping the security switch to "on".

There's so much wrong with this I can barely begin but I'll try to stay within the scope.  Author thinks this can replace both the dollar and BTC and somehow get the benefits of both. 
There are *literally* no benefits to a decentralized currency for the Banks or The Fed. Banks and all their cohorts (inlcuding visa, mastercard, etc.) make tons of money with their overpriced payment services. They are in no mood to give this up. Furthermore this whole idea of "preventing" bubbles is smoke and mirrors. They are in the business of *creating* bubbles, that's where the profit is. And if they pop no big deal, they get a bail out. 
They can try and very well might create a distributed ledger based currency and it might even gain a market cap in the trillions quickly but it will ultimately be as big a joke as any other fiat when it ultimately fails. It's *only* purpose would be to displace bank transfer fees and if it's even slightly anonymous will quickly be adopted for illegal industry and money laundering. Of course none of that's a problem just as long as it never leaves the fiat system. Hell, it's not a problem *now* as banks have already laundered amounts that make bitcoin's market cap look like lunch money.   
tl:dr: Big fat fail. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 00:19:10
I'm not advocating tax cheats by any means but the idea that the IRS has anything to do with the NSA is absurd. It's estimated that there's tens of trillions of dollars that the IRS can't even find in *conventional* money.

This isn't the way to do this mainly because it's not cost effective. The best thing to do is to use off chain transactions. (This is what fees are for, it's so you can "rent" the services of other miners to confirm). Just keep a receive only wallet with the same centralized wallet provider customers use. Customer scans the QR of the service they use (circle, coinbase, etc.) and you're done.

You're thinking in exchange rate terms but not percentage. The percentage they own can necessarily only go down, not up. (Unless they buy more but the whale theory supposes they *aren't* rich. Unless you think they all the sudden became expert traders) If/when they sell the coins are redistributed, wealth disparity thus decreases rather than increases. You can derive appreciation but not usury. That's the big difference and make no mistake it *is* a difference, a very big one. That's because bitcoins will eventually find equilibrium and will no longer increase in value. That means that wealth cannot be indefinitely sustained or even *increased* over the long term.

The big difference is that they advance you coins *and* you can buy on credit and debit card instantly. They seem to have obsoleted the last major complaint about buying bitcoins.  What's not to like? Even if you ignore everything about coinbase as rumor then this is clearly an advantage. I'm not coinvinced that circle will retain these policies but for now they are clearly superior in most ways except maybe the buy limit..... which coinbase won't usually let you use anyway without canceling orders.

The wallet industry is where I think you'll see *lots* of future action. I envision transparent 3, 4, 5 or more factor authentication in the future. Transparent means exactly that. Imagine a physical transaction with a hardware wallet or smart phone. The first authentication could be RFID of your device followed by GPS, followed by facial ID, followed by finger print, followed by pin. The technology isn't important, even bluetooth or wifi or both could be used in addition or separately. The possibilities are nearly endless. Even a Luddite could interact with such a system without having to learn anything. Wallet providers will become the new "banks" of today. They will provide insurance against unauthorized transactions based on risk assessment and thus refunding your money in the event of fraud.
Low risk transactions (using the most verification methods) would be free or virtually free. Alternatively the merchant could choose to "insure" transactions themselves (thus gaining customers) via an additional level of verification which would be akin to signing up for a store card. Perhaps your shopping out of town or in a different part of town? No problem, the merchant could still "insure" you at their own expense and might be willing to because this would only be a small percentage of their transactions albeit at a slightly higher risk. On your first or second visit they might ask you if you'd like to make this a "regular" location and provide some incentive for doing so, perhaps a discount or freebie which would cut their risk in the process. Users will be happy to do this due to reduced wallet fees but if they don't they will likely be offered a grace period by their wallet provider.
Note that for the user this is all very granular and transparent. Merchants would be incentivised by wallet providers (the new "banks") to employ high authentication methods or subject their customers to higher fees. Merchants in high compliance would receive a higher star rating for example and gain customers by subjecting their clients (via their wallet provider) to lower fees.

Nearly every other coin makes unacceptable trade offs that lead to moral hazard or technical instability in their implementations. Proof of stake for example leads to wealth disparity. Then there's network effect. Those who think that a new coin will overtake bitcoin ignore the fact that bitcoin is fully extensible and most of it's features have not even had their surface scratched. I often liken bitcoin the TCP/IP. It's decades strong and it's extensibility likewise makes talk of a replacement laughable.

Probably because everyone knew they were going to be bailed out. At some point the bail outs have to stop. This could also be a side effect of having too much paper gold on the markets.


It's a bit more than that these days bit admittedly still not very significant. 


But that conflicts with the idea that the bitcoin market cap is too small to be meaningful. During a crash you sell the house, not just the copper piping.

I don't give a fuck what they think. Their Keynesian black magic has no power here. Be gone! They are wrong. Period. If they weren't then Doge would have the multi-billion dollar market cap and not bitcoin. This alone proves they are *wrong*. Monetary policy is not exempt from entropy and the second law of thermodynamics by simply declaring it by decree no more than conservatives can decree global warming a myth because it's "convenient". Economists are *always* wrong. Studies show them to be no more accurate than coin toss and that's being *generous*.

This is really just an extension of the 51% attack argument. It would require extensive collusion which would itself be transparent. Everyone knows how much hashing is on the network. In free markets if someone won't supply a product you go elsewhere. This isn't complicated technology compared to what the big guys are doing. Intel for example has the FAB capacity to destroy these players overnight but it wouldn't even take an Intel. If China is no longer willing to supply ASICs then other competitors will step in especially if they stand to make more money seeing as a major competitor has chosen to step out of the game. Everyone knows this is arms race which means there's no ultimate "winner".... other than the network itself.

This is a last resort situation but people like you won't listen because you're living in a dream world devoid of pragmatism while completely ignoring the profit motive of simply using ones massive investment to mine bitcoins.  The fact that it's *already* uneconomical to begin with should stop the discussion cold and yet you persist! You might as well argue that bitcoin will fail due to heat death of the universe. If people had brought this level of ad nauseum idiocy to fiat we'd still be trading goats, shells, and sacks of wheat.  
Bitcoin is not meant to be perfect because in the real world *nothing* is perfect. And I don't mean that as an offhanded quip. I mean *literaly* nothing is perfect. But don't take my word for it. Go as ask a security expect if there's such a thing as *perfect* security. Sorry but there isn't. If someone tells you there is they're a liar.  Bitcoin is simply the most perfect out of every other alternative and until you can point to a better working alternative you're not allowed to just beg the theoretical as it's the height of intellectual laziness.

The topic as a whole is better suited to the college level however that doesn't mean that the basics can't be taught. It just depends on how *basic* you think it should be. 
In my mind the important aspects of bitcoin are not the technical ones and they are likely to ruffle feathers.

Once you understand these aspects the technology explains how the trust of bitcoin is enforced.

The scarcity property of bitcoin is often compared to gold which should theoretically please libertarians but in practice bitcoin is not overwhelmingly supported in libertarian circles.
Even if you're not of a libertarian mindset bitcoin offers several other properties that are advantageous over precious metals. In addition gold is not necessarily as scarce as most are led to believe as it is likely abundant throughout the universe and is also synthesized in "common" nuclear fission reactors but in fairness neither of these is considered economically viable at the present.
Other important properties of bitcoin include the blockchain and the fact that it can be transmitted and stored virtually friction free. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 02:24:26
This. People are treating these coins as a zero sum game, they aren't. Altcoins will not gain value at expense of other coins but at the expense of fiat, just like bitcoin itself.

Banks reserve the right to close your account for any reason or no reason at all (meaning they don't have to tell you the reason). This happens often to sellers on localbitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 22:39:53
I'm not really anticipating anything "better" considering that bitcoin is highly extensible via projects like mastercoin, etc. The technology behind bitcoin is not particularly complex which is why it's best referred to as a protocol, a strictly followed set of rules. TCP/IP is a great example. It's been around for decades, has anything better come along? Sure, it's been extended but not replaced. Is there any talk of replacing it? Not really. 
That being said there are possible reasons for the market to move onto other coins but I would consider these more market moves than technological. If for example bitcoin experiences a 51% "takeover" or perhaps SHA256 is compromised. (Which *itself* could be an even bigger issue.)  In either case the market would take over and the value of bitcoin would flow into a new coin (or perhaps basket of coins) nearly overnight until some equilibrium is reached and the shakeup concluded.  
Beyond that we get into comically existential risks that would not even be considered in the realm of fiat such as an internet shutdown but that's not unlike cutting off your own foot. Shutting down an entrenched bitcoin economy would be the same. Such arguments applied to fiat would be like The Treasury running out of ink and paper.  
But even this possibility makes bitcoin strong because there's practically zero friction in crypto trading. It's quite easy to diversify and people forget the the volatility issue gets better by the day.

It's a moot question. The market cap has no effect on the amount of mining required. The difficultly rate is simply attached to Moore's Law, it has nothing to do with market cap. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 16:21:18
So far I'd say it's a better investment than my last 1TH machine but that's only because the price tanked. If the mining calculation was done at the current price and the price shoots back up to the 20% it lost (which it should) then this might be profitable.  I don't know.... ask me again when/if I pass ROI. 
Generally it's best to buy minors when the price is down as they seem to be pegged to bitcoin.

The best indicator I like is bitcoins market cap ratio to M1 or even M2 money (dollars). 
Even taking the most conservative money supply numbers we know that these numbers are hundreds of times larger than bitcoins tiny $10 billion or so market cap. This gives a decent indication of money adoption rate which even at it's most conservative estimate is a tiny fraction of 1%.

OK so even if the highly improbable happens markets have a tendency to correct things just as fast.

Does it mater? The reason people aren't spending right now is because they don't have enough money. Period. If you want people to spend more money than give them some of it. 
The whole idea that people won't spend bitcoins is absurd. People will always spend money because people will always need things.... even if it's just food. Which brings us the amazing magic of supply and demand (which idiot economists seem to forget all the time.). If people don't spend enough then prices will go down and thus more people will spend. 
What economists should be asking is why the rich aren't spending any money. Their answer might be that the rich don't get rich "wasting" money. And yet they expect those holding bitcoins to? Cognitive dissonance much? Next they'll be saying that interest rates should be permanently set to zero or else people will never spend dollars! Oh wait, they already *are* and people *still* aren't spending dollars! But I'm sure these charlatans have some idiotic explanation for that too. 
@_date: 2015-05-01 20:16:24
Alt coins can help from an economic perspective. People are over focused on a theoretical crisis in technology and forget that one can be mitigated via market means. Bitcoin itself isn't as important as the value it facilitates. It's liquidity can flow instantly into an alt coin and already does if there's some kind of real or perceived threat to it's infrastructure. That aspect *alone* is already an advantage that fiat will never have. 
@_date: 2014-11-20 15:20:03
It's pretty much a no brainer. There's no risk in converting the bitcoins to cash but you can also hold them if you choose to speculate on the price..... or do so sometime in the future. The main selling point if bitcoin is to reduce the cost of payment transactions.

Probably not. That being said it *could* happen. It could happen *without* bitcoin. A bank can close your account for *any* reason and that reason does not have to be stated and often isn't. Because of this no one should rely on a single bank for all their financial transactions. 
If the bank chooses to close or freeze your account you will still get the money back but in the mean time you're not going to have access to your money to pay for anything. Not the end of the world if you have few weeks of cash or credit rely on but expect any ACH or debit payments to fail would could result in late fees and even hurt your credit. I had a bank charge me a $35 "declined transaction fee" for a *deposit*, not a withdrawal. No, I'm not kidding.  Note that credit card agreements also have clauses that can void promotional rates (or up your interest rate to the max amount) if they get wind that you have been late or delinquent on *any* account in your name.  
Again all these things can happen with or without bitcoin. And you've already agreed to them in those mountains of text you didn't read when you opened your account/s. That means have some kind of contingency plan which should involve using multiple accounts. 
I hate to make this sound drastic because these are worst case examples that likely aren't probable but are *possible* which is what you asked. 
@_date: 2014-08-07 09:54:33

@_date: 2014-07-22 01:45:04
Oh boy... where do I even begin? The key strength of bitcoin lies in the fact that it's a deflationary (or *hard*) currency. Everyone involved with bitcoin needs to understand why this is important. Most already do which is why they are so enamored with bitcoin.  The world as we know it for the last several hundreds years or has been controlled by central banking to various extents. These are complex issues but basically central banks are the defacto standard around for the world for *every* currency. The Federal Reserve tends to be the best example simply due to the dollar hegemony around the world but it's not the only one.  Oil is traded exclusively in dollars.... but that's a different albeit related issue.

As long as it has a second disk it should be fine. A bitcoin node is both I/O and somewhat CPU intensive whereas a NAS is merely IO intensive. Ideally flash memory is best for both the boot OS and blockchain storage. A conventional disk will certainly keep up but it's going to drain some power running 24/7. A conventional disk is fine for a NAS as it should spin down when it's not being actively used (make sure to set up power management to be certain). Just keep in mind that the blockchain is going to keep growing so it's anyones guess how much storage it's going to chew up.

I'm sick of hearing these shallow arguments. It's not the number owned but the *percentage* that matters.

If you don't understand this then you need to extrapolate some numbers and watch what happens.

Banks don't all trust each other. And even when they "kind of" trust each other they still don't completely. Let's get that myth out of the way. If you think they do then try to get a large cashiers check cashed from a major bank as a new customer and see what happens. 
If they did all trust each other transactions between them would clear instantly. The banking system as it stands basically uses risk assessment to decide what transactions to post and how "hard" they are. This is why if you want a "hard" transaction you must use a wire.

This is a feature rather than a bug of fiat currency. 
People who are concerned about large bitcoin holders need not be. Even the value of Satoshi's coins as a *percentage* of coins owned is constantly declining rather than increasing as it would in fiat currency. This is because bitcoins are devoid of usury. They can only increase in market value but this value eventually finds equilibrium so gone are the days of wealth concentrating over generations of powerful families.

Good luck. Once you learn "enough" about economics you quickly find that econ 101 is a lie and nearly every other thing has vast exceptions. They aren't necessarily wrong per say but when they are it's usually out of context or didn't fit the scope or domain. That's even before you get into "lying with statistics". Thus is why it's called the dismal science which is why I prefer contrarian dicotomies. I'm a big fan of Taleb and behavioral economics generally. This explains how otherwise intelligent people are often irrational.  Economics works great when when we're all a bunch of robots be we aren't.

True.

That is to say that it's not merely a philosophy of "American" convenience but in fact a requirement for a potential overthrow of weaker economic systems.
But why must bitcoin overthrow an existing economic system? It doesn't necessarily *need*  to to be successful but if it logically *can't* it calls into question its systemic weaknesses. And we know that nothing will be successful within a free market system (at least beyond niche markets) if it cannot compete with it's competition.

They can try but the effects are merely temporary. In a selloff event it's much faster to move liquidity into other cryptos. Fiat moves rather slow in comparison. In addition don't discount the effects of market forces. It's difficult for bitcoin to become overvalued by it's existing nature. Markets in this day tend to reach equilibrium rather quickly. By tanking fiat prices you're merely raising crypto prices.

@_date: 2016-12-31 16:26:03
I prefer to think of bitcoin a three prong system of Technology, Philosophy, and Finance. Without the other two the technology that holds bitcoin together isn't particularly interesting. I suppose you could lump the last two together but I prefer not to because bitcoin doesn't follow the "rules" of traditional finance (in which the laws of thermodynamics need not apply for some reason). Thus I think it's important that the hard money system be lumped under Finance as a key to bitcoins importance. Then there's Philosophy which is simply the promise of what bitcoin can bring to the world when all it's ideals are fully realized (which it's technology does not allow to be corrupted in any way) which is essentially a world free of wealth disparity. Don't misunderstand this. It's a common fallacy that bitcoin might perpetuate wealth disparity. This isn't true because bitcoin is free of usury. Do not confuse this with market arbitrage as arbitrage is only a temporary market situation which is eventuality normalized in a free market.  Thus the wealth distribution of bitcoin cannot be permanently assured by stake holders because bitcoin is (once again) free of usury. To put it another way bitcoins seemingly perpetual increase in "value" is not infinitely sustainable. It cannot be used to hold a multi-generational position of "Worldwide wealth monopoly" as has been the case in the past due to a monopoly on popular money creation by central banks. Thus Staoshi can be not only credited with creating a new form of money but in fact the closest logical construct to a free market utopia.

Speaking of the Ƀ symbol I think it's horrible and I hate it. What made anyone think it was a good idea particularly when bitcoin is (currently) most prominently used in the US? And don't get me wrong, I'm generally an America loathing American and see bitcoin as an international currency but you can't deny that the greenback is perhaps the most internationally recognized and accepted currency particularly in black markets so I'd like to see the B take on the similarity of the dollar sign.

BTC is not investment. An investment by definition returns interest. Bitcoin does not accrue interest. Read the white paper. Now ultimately why "finance people" are baffled by bitcoin is it's not comparable to any asset in the history of the world. Literally. It's most comparible to gold which they in general already hate but unlike gold it can be stored and tranfered with virtually no effort. (not instantly but far faster and cheaper than a wire). And like gold it's finite. It's also the first digital asset that cannot be duplicated. But unlike gold the holdings of everyone can be instantly verified with no cost or effort. And you need no intermediary to exchange it. These are all incredible value propositions never before seen. But alas we have a final philosophical issue in that bitcoin is a hard currency. The traditional argument against is that there's "not enough to go around" but each bitcoin can be effectively split infinitely with minor code changes and no devaluation of the currency. This also could never be done before. Not to mention that It's not conscripted to any particular country. It also cannot be hacked which is why (for better or for worse) it's the currency of hackers. Thus it is the most perfect currency. Period.

The point of bitcoin is not to convert it to fiat but to exchange it for goods and services. Sure it's pegged to fiat right now but the won't necessarily always be the case. Ask yourself this, if you operate a cash business do you or should you have to deal with KYC/AML regulations? If so then why is cash even legal? The real issue here is that there is no real clarity in these regulations. They are ridiculously ambiguous and were clearly never meant to apply to transactions under 10k and yet they seem to be absurdly applied in such cases. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:42:48
Yes. But it doesn't mater or ultimately change anything. It's not a bubble, it will still go up (For now) and these people will bankrupt themselves if they spend all their BTC. And they will because BTC doesn't work like fiat. But that doesn't mater either because it gets redistributed. What people don't get is this is a very, very, very long game which completely changes economics as we know it. There's no interest with bitcoin. There's no inflation. There's no deflation. The price is rising due to feit arbitrage and will eventually reach an equilibrium which will force people to be more conservative and less wastefull with there money because resouces will finally be priced correctly. This also saves the earth and flattens poverty and wealth disparity. It's all a very good thing. If it *seems* like you're getting something for free you're not. It just means that goods and services are astronomically overpriced due to fiat inflation.

You seriously think that government is going to stop banks and big money from doing *anything*? Wachovia laundered 380 billon in mexican drug money and paid a fine of less than 200 million. Because that's what they do. The law clearly does not apply to them.
Even if they do stop bank investments fine. It's actually better that way but if you think that's what's driving the price you're ridiculous. The market cap is absolutely insignificant compared to the trillions that are moving in the global economy. They're looking at it but they arn't jumping in. It's individuals.  Many are rich but it's a few hundred million here and there at most. You can't stop markets. The DEA has been trying for decades and the amount of money moving grows by the year.
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:02:18

Often a term used to give the impression that both sides are equaly correct but merely represent a "difference of opinion".

Bitcoin is objectively a currency. Admittedly it could also fit the definition of investment but not in the long term because equilibrium will eventually be reached in relation to fait currency which is why arbitrage applys. Investments stand on there own right and are not pegged to currencies where as bitcoin will always be pegged to other currencies because it's a currency. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 09:57:04
I'm going to take a guess and say a bias against hard money. Keep in mind that the technological component is not the only revolutionary one in regards to bitcoin. 
This is really the same reason why many people don't like bitcoin or are bias against it. The reason is not (as is often assumed by bitcoiners) that they don't "understand the technology" (although this may be true as well). There's a cognitive cognitive dissonance that comes along in order to keep someone for realizing that they've been ripped off by the banking system their entire life. 
tl:dr: Hackers don't understand monetary theory. But then again *no one* does.

You've never taken a payment by credit card have you?
@_date: 2018-11-10 03:05:03
This is actually a rather common refi rate for "average to subpar" credit. The alternative generally being 25% plus "low credit" or just "idiot rates". If you're in that boat hard to say no but for those with decent credit they should be able to get that into the low single digits.
It should however be noted that you'd be significantly ahead of the market had you taken out a loan at the "idiot rate" to buy bitcoin even just a couple short years ago.

It's not nessesarily but if you'd be mining anyway it is. It ideally works best for more temperate climates. Nearly all energy consumption results in waste heat so if you can use it all the better. In the summer you're paying to dissipate that heat unless you're using a more efficient method like evaporative cooling, etc. As always creativity rewards good economics and vice versa.

They likely will but you have to ask and pay for it. As a vendor it's not that we don't want to but that it's just not as common. It's also the fact that your local customs may levy large taxes (VAT?) which can detract from the customer experience. The US has the lowest tax rates in the developed world. It's not all sunshine however as we have no universal health care and and a federally mandated minimum wage of only 9.26 AUD. Some states are also higher but not by much.

@_date: 2018-11-10 02:59:47
At first glance this looks sketchy but if you believe in bitcoin it allows you to leverage future gains against a (much smaller by comparison....by future time,  we hope..) fiat based debt. And yes you're required to trust the current financial system as currently regulated by law. 
Downside?! Bitcoin crashes and you've doubled down!  So while this isn't for everyone it's rather appealing to the true believers.

It's not a very liquid market at the moment as the rig manufacturers tend to source most of or use their own chips. But this will likely change in the future as more ASIC fabs like Samsung start putting out more chips.
It's a very tight market and will likely continue to be and using a turnkey rig greatly simplifies ROI calculations.

This statement is contradictory as you seem to be referring to market cap. The design is intended to float on the free market which already makes it wildly successful. 
Should it become a reserve currency It's exchange value will automatically increase simply due to demand. This seems to be a common criticism which ignores the fact that it's effectively infinitely devisable and doesn't require a central bank to manage it's supply.

Except supply and demand dynamics would exponentially have ripple effects on the entire IC market including cell phones, tablets, computers, etc and exponentially raise prices market wide unless you  want to invest additional billions on state of the art wafer and chip plants. The idea that take it over in a vacuum is absurd. Even if you could the capital could instantly flow into other crypto in hours tanking your investment so you'd better be prepared to take over the entire GPU market as well.

Bitcoins value is unpredictable. Period. To think it's going to stay anywhere for any length of time is unfounded. Just a couple weeks ago it hit over $300. Basic economic supply and demand principles suggest it's going to go up however seeing that the supply will always be limited. 
As far as bitcoin as an "intermediate transaction tool" it only functions are one right now because few accept it but the more that accept it the less that will *need* to use it as an intermediary which is not it's actual purpose at all. But ignore that. Even as an intermediary *only* it's value can still rise a lot as the global remittance market is valued at over a half a *trillion* dollars and growing. 
The first world is in decline. The biggest growth areas in the future are developing nations which banks are not very interested in doing business in. With little existing banking infrastructure bitcoin is poised to become much more of a primary currency than an intermediate one especially in places where cell phones are more affordable then food.

Bitcoin a unique trifecta of technology, economics, and philosophy. To understand bitcoin you need to understand all three which tends to be a problem for the vast majority of the public mainly due to preconceived dichotomies at best and cognitive dissonance at worst.  But bitcoin will succeed because revolutionary ideas don't depend on existing conceptions. Perhaps most importantly one needs to question the very concept of money itself, where it comes from, how it is created, and it's relationship to the physical world. Once one understands this they they will understand that economists as we currently know them will one day be synonymous with charlatans and imbeciles. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 21:32:29
First of all deflation is only a problem of fiat currencies due to the concept of debt. Under a hard currency paradigm there's no debt (because the lack of inflation makes it unnecessary) and thus no deflation. Now some might say you can still have debt. Well you *can* no one will want to issue debt because there's no party that will bail them out. 
Because of money creation fiat systems always fail, *always*. Even if "this time is different" well banks still fail and we will *always* bail them out thus fiat currency will always represent moral hazard socialized losses. 
Now economics will chime in with lots complex, fancy, blabber why this isn't true but you must understand that their entire profession is pseudoscience thus making their opinion worthless.

Even precious metals (it's closest comparison) are not comparable because they don't share the same advantages. Not only are they more difficult to trade they are nearly impossible to inventory which makes market manipulation possible. By any metric cryptos are different.

I haven't ruled this out but it won't stop bitcoin, it will merely slow it down just as the "War on (some) Drugs" hasn't stopped the availability of drugs. So while it's a threat it's not a long term one. The genie is already out of the bottle.

You're taking an overly simplistic view of the monetary system. The market is self adjusting. It doesn't mater if they destroy the coins or not. If they're never spent then they're as good as destroyed. Spending them all just inflates the currency. A coin spent will never be worth as much as an unspent coin. Once you spend it you can never get it back without a a real economic contribution that exceeds the original coins value. Of course someone else then gets the use the coin *and* take advantage of it's increasing value. In that way wealth distribution is constantly increased and liquidity traps are avoided. While it's true your coins will always be worth more the flip side is you'll always have less *total* coins. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:48:20
Yep. Bitcoin has effectively "hacked" the fiat banking system and (at least for now) it's perfectly legal. The only thing they can do is drop you as a customer.... I guess.

I think you way overestimating the amount of training that retail employees actually *get*. As far as refunds etc. I would assume they mirror existing cash policies. That means all transactions pegged to the dollar *including* refunds.  AKA the "Richard Branson" method. That is to say returns still in bitcoin but only at the current cash rate. 
That of course means the customer would lose real value on returns but this could be mitigated by incentivising bitcoin transactions with discounts or other "loyalty" options. This actually discourages returns which should please retailers. You could say it discourages sales but that's a dubious assumption considering that people are clammering to buy *with* bitcoin.  
There's no risk in doing this because everything settles to cash at the current rate. Of course businesses would be free to convert to native bitcoin at any time but there's no need to force them.

That's built into the protocol. It's like trying to explain why you have a better chance of getting your credit card number stolen going out to eat than ordering something online. 


You mean like the stock market? You do realize that the markets are rallying because the Federal reserve is pumping in $85 *billion* dollars a month into the markets each month right? So far they have pumped in over $4 *trillion*. For reference the US national debt is $17(+?) trillion. That money is creating *hidden* inflation on the poor and middle class mostly in the form of higher food prices. Haven't you noticed everything shrinking in the grocery store? 
Bitcoins market cap it only 6 *billion*. It's so small you can't see the amount being skimmed off the markets. It's not "free" money, other people are losing money it's just they have so much they can't even see it. (Remember Officespace?) People have absolutely no concept of what even a billion dollars looks like:
One trillion is 1000x more than this. If the bitcoin market cap hits a trillion it's still less than 1% of world currency holdings. It's speculated that there's *trillions* of dollars just in "hidden" money overseas. The world is quite literally drowning in money, it's just that very few people have all of it.  Just how much wealth is there? There's enough for every person on earth to have $51,600, all 7 billion of them. 3 Billion of these people live on less than $2.50 per day. 
Trust me, the superrich don't *need* all this money. There's really nothing you can buy with a trillion dollars that you can't buy with a billion. 
Wouldn't you like some of it?

That wasn't so much of a problem when coins were $50 each or less. With only a few hundred dollars per user they can easily be pushing hundreds of millions of dollars a week. That's millions of dollars a month in transaction fees. It's not hard to see they have a "problem" that *every* business wishes they had. 
Obviously they've way oversold their capacity. If they were processing 10 BTC per day, per user they'd be pushing over a billion dollars a day even at today price. That's the *entire* bitcoin market cap in a week or two. 
But lets say they're only pushing 1% of that, that's still $4 million dollars a day or $126 million a month. I'd say this is causing some problems. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 14:53:37
Did anyone get the *last* question? And is it safe to assume that it would be irrelevant anyway until the last coin is mined.... sometime in 2140? 
In addition I was dissatisfied with the answer prior to that on the 51% attack. Perhaps that needs a whole different thread. Realistically how expensive would a 51% attack be and what kind of time frame would it take just to acquire the hardware to do it? But forget about the price. 
Wouldn't just the attempt (at least one with any realistic possibility)  cause such a large spike in ASIC prices that it would be immediately suspicious? Would it not cause incumbent miners to move immediately to the safe haven of another altcoin thus simultaneously tanking bitcoin while "inflating" that altcoin? I'm imagining something like a virtual form of "whack a mole" with cryptos. Perhaps it would be more feasible to launch a 51% attack on other cryptos first?

No, they couldn't. Their bread and butter is debt based fiat. While it's true they could make money there's no way they could ever make *more* money. Cryptos kill that golden goose.

I think lightweight (as in hardware *and* software) solutions are great for cryptos. Low complexity means low attack surface and they really shouldn't require fast hardware but merely *durable* hardware. I don't know much about POS hardware but I know most of is really old and runs over serial and whatnot. Such support might be a good idea. I would envision a little covered doorway (maybe with a silicone seal) where you could plug in a replaceable flash drive for an optional blockchain rather than have it dangling off the side waiting to break. Or maybe just a couple sealed SDcard slots? 
And optional battery pack with laptop cells that could run it a few days would be ideal for the developing world or even a solar option.  Perhaps even stack-able modular options with silicone seals?

Speculation isn't a problem because it's all short term. They are cashing out for worth less fiat and thus they will still lose this game. "Hoarding" also isn't a problem, the currency is self regulating. In fact it helps stabilize the currency against fiat.  A deflationary currency simply can't be gamed. The only exception might be gold because many never take physical delivery. Despite this the price is *still* stable.

That's only because The Fed is expected to maintain the illusion of being impartial. Remember that there's no such thing as bad publicity so always keep your comments boring and neutral if you don't want them publicized. The general stance is "ignore it and it will go away". Remember that *everything* novel is by definition an "innovative idea", that doesn't mean to imply that it's a *good* one. Remember the 5 assed monkey?  
Of course if Bernanke so much as farts in a room of journalists the financial media starts speculating on what he had for dinner last night but the point still stands. We're not going to be seeing "bitcoin set to destroy the dollar" headlines anytime soon....if ever.

All the fiat will flood into bitcoin and other cryptos. Right now it's merely a trickle, soon it will be a tsunami. That being said gold will also rise but perhaps not as much. 
Gold is theoretically solid however it's too easy to manipulate. It's easy to know how many bitcoins are available but you can't take an accurate gold inventory. Far too much of it is on paper. If you can't see, feel, and touch your gold then it might not be yours.

No it doesn't, other markets are driven by much more complex fundamentals.  Currency markets gain value by leaching from other currencies. Because the market cap for crypto is so small and fiat so large there's only one way the money can flow and that's *inward*. Ultimately cryptos can only *gain*. It really is that simple.  
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:11:40
Yeah it kind of does. Fiat systems *always* fail. 
And the fact that the dollar will start to tank due to cryptos is the reason. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:34:23
Bitcoin however is completely logical once you understand how doomed fiat currencies are. They aren't falling yet because bitcoin can just barely begin to chip into their massively inflated valued. Bitcoin can hit a 100 billion dollar market cap and it's *still* under 1% of world currency holdings.  
Once the tsunami takes hold so much fiat will flood into bitcoin (and other crypto) people won't know what hit them.

This just can't happen because it's irrational. There's always a base level of consumption. Even *rich* people still have to eat! A non-fiat is self regulating. If you don't spend it the price goes down. If you spend it too quickly the price goes up. Simple. 
Right now it only *looks* like the price is rising. What's actually happening is fiat is *falling*.

Yes, but liquidity is not necessarily currency and vice versa. Assets need not be liquid to be measured in currency.  That is to say that existing assets will be valued in the dominant currency rather than the incumbent one. 
*However* when/if this time comes assets will not be additive to the monetary base. In fact *nothing* is additive to the monetary base, any apparent differences merely indicate the absence of complete equilibrium.
For example the total amount of bitcoin and dollars will always add up to the equalized market value of a third monetary instrument, no more, no less. It's the the market value assigned to each that changes, not the sum total thus it can be assumed that bitcoin will increase in value while dollars decrease but their summed total will not change.

That's funny considering we're back in the great depression. I'm sorry but any normal Joe would be cheering for deflation and would throw a party if beers were all the sudden a quarter. 
This "it would have been worse" argument is absurd. it's a non argument because you have no proof of this. Granted I have no "proof" that things would be much better without QE other than the simple fact that QE ISN'T CAPITALISM. It's called creative destruction and it's a very necessary part that they decided was "inconvenient".  QE is just the equivalent of taking more narcotics when you really *need* that root canal and expecting it to get better. It's all so fucking insane it would make Adam Smith roll around in his grave.

It can't screw anyone over as baddly as fiat. There will nessesarily be a lot more to go around because it's simply impossible to pump trillions of dollars into bitcoin fast enough to retain that wealth. In fact it's already too late. The bitcoin billionaires and trillonaires are already made.

Money tends to flow into areas that are already the least populated not unlike how gravity pushes water in the crevices of least resistance. From a market perspective this is basic equilibrium. Right now there's an absurd amount of liquidity in the markets that are searching for investment. 
Stocks will always be limited in the amount of investment they can accommodate without popping but bitcoin isn't a stock, it's a currency. The only practical limit with currencies is the market cap of incumbent currencies. We're talking about hundreds of *trillions* of dollars chasing a few billion of bitcoin's existing minuscule market cap. That means that even  if bitcoin can only capture less than 1% of currency markets bitcoins will still be pushed up several hundred times higher than they currently are. That means that bitcoins worth 100k or even a million dollars each are not unreasonable. Even a low ball estimate would put them at $10,000 each.

That is to say several days *after* the money has cleared your account. 
 &gt; You can always check your bank account though to see if the money has already been taken out as that would be a good indicator whether or not the transaction will have gone through.
Not so, they debit the account regardless but then redeposit the funds rather than canceling the ACH before the debit is complete. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 05:34:10
Point 2 is by far the most interesting. I'm fascinated with how even the "smartest" people can not understand the theory of money (or more specialty the *facts* of money). How can so many people call themselves scientists while blatantly ignoring the second law of thermodynamics when it comes to monetary policy?  But then the bankers have had literally decades to refine their scam. 
When you consider the psychological aspects the protocol starts to look even more brilliant than it already is. I suspect the gold bugs are just sore and will come around. I don't see bitcoin coming to eat golds lunch completely. Gold still has real advantages that bitcoin will never have. The most important one is that it doesn't require a complex technology or communications infrastructure. This doesn't mean I'm not bullish on bitcoin but you have to admit that bitcoin would have problems surviving a total network or computing collapse. That being said gold is really (*literally*) just a post nuclear option or maybe just a viable one for Luddites. 
On the other hand bitcoin can still survive on even very old infrastructure, perhaps even dug up Pentiums and thicknet connections but in a postapocalyptic world it might be expensive, something you wouldn't use all the time, perhaps just for purchasing gold and other physical commodities that you would trade directly for. But even then there's still so much technological "junk" it's hard to see it all disappearing. I doubt there's not at least a dozen or so "computers" on earth for each person alive.  I mean people are installing linux on their coffee makers for God's sake! Maybe the geeks really *do* inherit the earth?

People are going to downvote this but your best option might seriously be to mine. The slightly *better* option would be to buy mining shares *if* you can find one that will take some other form of accessible currency. Presumably you have access to electricity and computer hardware which are the main inputs required for bitcoin mining. 
You're other options are of course to trade locally but that's assuming you can find someone to trade with. 
One novel option might be to obtain US or European gift cards and attempt to trade them online for bitcoins. But I don't know where you might start. You would need a website the *opposite* of Gyft. Gift cards themselves require little to no verification and can perhaps be purchased from tourists in local currency.

You're missing the point. Of course it doesn't go out of circulation but that's the problem. It just means the value drops out (inflation). This just isn't notable yet because you're talking about a monetary base of hundreds of trillions chasing bitcoin's tiny 15 billion cap. It's the *value* that "leaks". 
Bitcoin will have to hit at *least* a few hundred trillion cap before it moves the dollar down even a fraction of a cent but even this might not be enough because dollars aren't the only fiat in the world.

Hey, that's a perfectly plausible take however if every "serious entrepreneur" thought this way there would be no serious entrepreneurs, certainly no Steve Job's or Bill Gate's. 
The "what took ye so long" article explains why bitcoin is so misunderstood. It literally takes experts in fields that don't generally overlap to understand the "big picture" of it's implementation. If you fail to fully understand *all* these fields then you will fail to fully understand bitcoin. Of course fully understanding it is not a road block to it's adoption just as most never considered a PC until they understood it's utility from the workplace or perhaps a friend. This is "full" understanding is merely necessary to get backers to support it initially. But unlike the "concept" PC bitcoin already *works* today. The backlash is akin to someone seeing the first telephone and complaining it will never take off because the call quality is so poor despite having so many additional advantages over the incumbent technology. Additionally the biggest complaint about bitcoin (volubility) is itself only temporary. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 10:43:41
Yes.  Looks interesting. Read the developer blog. They're based in New York and are looking for funding. The start up proposal looks decent but it looks like they have significant mastercoin holdings. They *seem* legit but it's hard to tell sometimes.

Not the same due to market cap. This is nearly one percent of the monetary base (or something, either way it's *big*) But it would be far bigger in fiat. A similar transaction in the fiat monetary base would be like several *trillion* dollars. You'd *never* see that. 
But then some might ask why no one would notice trillions of dollars moving. The answer is that these transactions are so few and far between that they're totally off the radar. It's a statistical outlier.  If you work fraud, drug, investigations, etc. you're never going to see this because you're too busy looking at the hundreds, thousands or even millions of transactions that meet specific criteria for nothing even approaching a billion dollars. Example: Find all cash transfers over 10k between Arizona and Mexico. 
That's why *banks* and the rich can easily get away with this shit. If you want to steal, steal *big* otherwise you're going to get caught.

@_date: 2013-11-28 02:10:56


Yes; It's just not noticeable yet because the rise is still so small in comparison to fiat. Bitcoin needs to hit several trillion for reduced fiat valuation to be noticeable. Basically we're seeing fiat flood into bitcoin but there's also a fiat ocean to the tune of hundreds of trillions so you need a market cap of several trillion just to move the dollar down a fraction of a cent.

Even if they *did* the market is self correcting and can't be centrally controlled or influenced by their incumbent financial status. Hopefully this psychopathic rein of financial terror can finally end.

That all should go without saying of course. Frankly most is still (embarrassingly) in coinbase but I have some small blockchain and coinkite wallets. I figure some diversification is good. I was actually looking for a few more recommended online wallets, especially ones with good smart phone integration. I figure I wouldn't keep more than about $100 or so accessible on my phone.  
Currently I have bitcoinQT in a virtual machine but the host is somewhat suspect. (In a related note I'm starting to wonder how secure the VM code *itself* is between other VM's and the host but that's beyond the scope of this topic). 
I think the basic plan is to put BitcoinQT on an old netbook and maybe just run the whole thing on a flash drive. I know I don't need a full copy of the block chain to keep the wallet secure but I'd like to just be able to conveniently boot up the whole thing without having to worry about it. I'm just slightly concerned that the blockchain disk activity on the flash drive might wear out the memory.  Is the blockchain *rewrite* intensive or just read/write intensive? I know flash excels and random reads and writes but it's the rewrites I'm concerned with. Might there be a suggested allocation size for the disk format recommended? 
Later I'll probably look into cold storage options but humans (including myself) tend to be lazy. Does cold storage actually protect you any better than a physically protected paper wallet? I'm a little confused about that. 
I'll probably just eventually get a couple more cheap netbooks, depends how much money I end up putting into coin but then since bitcoin has turned me into a saver I'd rather not "waste" anymore money than I need to. Right now I have not quite 2 coins but for *me* that's kind of a lot of money especially since I haven't "made" much on the coins yet especially after the recent "crash". I figure I'm about break even at this point. 
I'll look into SELinux especially if it's lightweight. Thanks!

You're confusing bitcoin with a stock rather than a currency. There's no speculation, the concept is already proven. The "product" is already on the market and it's already being used. Unless the entire internet disappears tomorrow it's adoption rate will continue, it's market cap will grow, it's only limit is the market cap of fiat currencies or effectively hundreds of trillions of dollars. There no stock that level of upside.

It's not a stock, it's a currency, a deflationary one at that and thus by definition it cannot be a bubble. This behavior is perfectly expected and logical. The market cap is under 10 billion dollars where as fiat currency is measured in the hundreds of *trillions* of dollars. Just merely hitting a trillion dollars will send bitcoin over 10k. This behavior isn't helped by The Fed printing $85 billion a month (a fraction of bitcoins total market cap) and they aren't stopping anytime soon. Regardless you're seeing a flooding of fiat into cryptos and it has a very, very long way to go to reach any sort of equilibrium. 
This is an accurate description of what's happening and doesn't stem from any type of "delusion" or "irrational exuberance".  It is in fact economists that are delusional. It is a pseudo science that has abandoned it's own fundamentals via bail outs and inflation. When faced with the cognitive dissonance they have to make up elaborate narratives to explain whats happening in front of their own eyes. Of course it fell slightly last night but recovered for the most part but lets keep calling it a bubble anyway, propaganda has worked before right? That's so much easier than admitting that fiat currency is ripe for failure but seems to have gotten a reprieve via record high productivity, record low wages, bail outs, and unlimited quantitative easing. No mater, that still won't stop the flood. If you are not in cryptos you will learn to regret it. But that's OK. Too few people have too much wealth as it is. We're here to redistribute it with *actual* free market principles. You can wake up or stay in denial, the choice is yours. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 08:39:07
They can of course but they will never replace their trillions with bitcoins. They're already too late in the game for that. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 01:35:53
Inflation is still a "bit of concern" because he just cut QE down to $75 billion so the fiat is still bleeding profusely but *slightly* less than before. 
He would like people to believe that you can taper QE *without* having inflation which is absurd but that's of course redundant since economic policy to begin with is itself absurd. 
Ironically (or intentionally?) this slightly hurts bitcoin because it strengthens the dollar.... that is if you define "strengthening" as not letting someone bleed to death *quite* as fast as they were before. But not to worry, this is still comically insignificant.

Higher even. The market cap could be hundreds of trillions by the time this all shakes out. But that won't happen overnight and you have to leave some room for other cryptos in there as well.

This is a "back end" question. Basically you need to get in touch with their hardware and/or software suppliers about putting in a plug in or extension. This is beyond my area of expertise but perhaps another can elaborate?
Basically there are many standard methods to do this. Online these are called shopping card plug ins.  I'm sure bitpay or coinkite can help you out if you tell then what you're using. You also need to get with the merchants IT team since they are the ones that can best assist you with the integration. 
All of this assumes that they already *have* an existing POS system. If they don't then that's a whole separate issue but potentially an easier one. Just tell your POS supplier you need bitcoin support.

They think it's worthless when you can just "trust" a central bank. They fail to see that trust is one of the world's more valuable resources in a world increasingly devoid of it. You literally cannot do anything without trust and even when that trust is misplaced you rarely have any other option but to rely on it. Now trust is available to nearly anyone at virtually no cost. *That* is the true power and innovation of bitcoin.

I'm not exactly sure what you're asking. $15 billion is all the *bitcoin* in existence but this is rising extremely fast. 
We don't exactly know the full amount of fiat but it's in the several hundred *trillion* dollar range. That may or may not include the sum total of all fiat currencies and of course we know that the paper values are vastly inflated. That being said bitcoin could easily reach several hundred billion and *still* be less than 1% of the monetary base. 
Economists often talk in relation to GDP (gross domestic product) but this number only represents a single calender year and *not* all the money in existence. Ignoring this makes it seem like all the money is wiped out at the end of the year which is absurd. They often use this fact to suggest that bitcoin's cap can't exceed a certain percentage of GDP which is a fallacy because bitcoin is a *currency* not a stock.  
But even if we assume this to be true and bitcoin rises to even 1% of GDP that's still over $100 billion which (if you're still following and doing the math) makes each bitcoin worth over $6000.... give or take.   
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:20:33
Upon second thought you can't via technical means. (At least without the fore-mentioned TPM chip.) The basic premise is that you have to maintain physical security over your boot media otherwise your trusting it to "trust itself". 
The only alternative is to compare the media to a known signature yourself on an already trusted machine before boot. Admittedly the whole discussion starts to border on absurdity because there is no *perfect* security but merely *more* perfect security.  The reason is that *all* physical trust can potentially be breached but if you're unable to trust *something* then you can't trust *anything*.  
In practice you simply can't allow your media to fall out of your control of the control of a trusted third party but this should already be blatently obvious. To put this into real world terms you simply don't leave your car unlocked with the keys in the ignition.

Otherwise they are committing libel against the exchange or even yourself. That's when you lawyer up and file libel lawsuit which you're guaranteed to win. Or at least threaten to.

Indeed we did, but only because chaos is extremely profitable for bankers:




The author apparently cannot decide whether bitcoin creates an inflationary or *deflationary* spiral. If economists were physicists they would have you believe that gravity needs to be centrally controlled lest we unexpectedly float into space without their magical powers.

Are you suggesting that the OP is being dishonest? That's an absurd notion on so many levels. Where's the motive? It doesn't make any since at all. Even if OP is a banking shill then it only *supports* the fact that they are actively trying to undermine bitcoin. Either way the conclusion is exactly the same. 
But lets take it further. If I *was* a banking shill then why stop there? Why not claim that the exchange stole all my money an accused me of terrorism? Why would I implicate *myself* (the bank) as the culprit? Why not lay all the blame on the big, bad, shady, bitcoin industry rather than associating my squeaky clean bank brand with negative behavior against a customer? 
No where does it say that the customer is suspected of illegal activity which would of course open the bank up to the liabilities of unfounded suspicion. If we have established that then the only conclusion is that the bank is denying legitimate, legal commerce for no reason other than anti-competitiveness.

It can't "crash". It's not a stock. it's a currency. What we're seeing is market equilibrium in progress.... and that could take a *long* time.... or not.  Simply put there's hundreds of trillions in fiat chasing a few billion in bitcoins. A crash would mean bitcoins chasing fiat which is rather absurd since there's so much fiat and so little bitcoins. 
The "to the moon" people are right, not that they necessarily understand why or the exact dynamics. The reason is that if bitcoin hits even a fraction of 1% of currency reserves it will dramatically rise. 10k or even 100k may even turn out to be bearish numbers. 
Specifically a $1 trillion dollar market cap means 10k bitcoins. Just above 1% currency penetrations means 60K coins. 15% penetration means million dollar+ coins. The "problem" is that it doesn't get this high without fiat starting to take it in the shorts.... more on that later.  
Of course some coins remain to be founds which theoretically means *slight* deflation from these numbers but we're talking over the course of a 100+ *years* here. This however is moderated by the "lost coin" effect which equalize some of this inflation. 
It should be noted that significant penetration necessarily means fiat failure and/or *significant* fiat inflation. That means your bitcoins *deflate*. Right now a bitcoin seems expensive but that's only because the *dollar* is. If the dollar for example inflates down to a penny then the current bitcoin only buys $8.00 worth of "stuff". So yeah it's still worth 800x the dollar but it's not exactly hookers and blow money anymore. 
What I'm saying are that the above target projections while not inaccurate can be misleading. A 60k bitcoin for example while still extremely valuable isn't worth nearly as much if a Snickers bar is all the sudden $100.00. But then if *that* happens a bitcoin could easily exceed $10 million, or even $100 million of those ultracheap, near useless dollars. 
In the end the best thing about bitcoin is that it allows for accurate price discovery which we don't have at all right now. That means that a house is only worth 200k right now because money is cheap and accessible at a low interest rate. In a bitcoin world these factors would be far less relevant and would likely bring the cost down. There's also a downward effect on prices caused by more even wealth distribution at the high end. If there's less rich people period there's less of a market for expensive things. Right now the only reason you can charge $10 million dollars for a house is that there are people that *have* this kind of money. If they don't have it anymore than demand falls and thus the price falls. 
In short bitcoin will likely rise and rise a lot but this will mater far less when/if things are no longer priced in dollars but begin to be priced in bitcoins. At that point fiat currency values become completely irrelevant and bitcoins are now compared to the actual stuff they buy like bread, computers, etc. 
TL;DR: In the short term bitcoin rises but in the longer term it's harder to predict but either way it's still very good news. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:59:33

@_date: 2013-12-03 11:54:03
Wrong. Bitcoins gain value via cannibalizing the current value of fiat currency. This isn't complicated. It's not yet apparent because the market cap for bitcoin is measured in just a few billion vs.  the hundreds of trillions of fiat currency. Once the market cap increases to at least around a few hundred billion then fiat currency values will start to fall (albeit only *slightly*) across the board. 
A more simple way of putting this is that currency market equilibrium eventually "corrects" the value of fiat by lowering it.  That means bitcoin and other cryptos continue to rise against the dollar.  By definition bitcoin *cannot* be a bubble because it is a *deflationary* currency. Only fiat can be a bubble because (again be definition) it is inflationary. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 03:20:31

@_date: 2013-12-13 23:13:36


But we do. Simply put fiat's value will flow into bitcoin and further diminish the value of dollars thus the value of bitcoin will expand. We have more than enough data to suggest that technological innovation is exponential such as the growth of the internet, e-mail, social networking, cell phones, etc. 
It's an inevitability because fiat is inflationary and bitcoin is *deflationary*. To not believe this is to believe that fiat is not inflationary which is absurd at face value.... much like the dollar itself. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:52:05

Actually the real reason for this bias was rather eloquently explained in the following piece (Why bitcoin didn't come along sooner): 




Basically all these "geeks" think that money is exempt from the second law of thermodynamics. It speaks volumes to the level of brainwashing the banks have been able to pull off for decades.

This is *exactly* the point. At that point fiat is worthless as it should be. To think otherwise is to think that financial markets add something valuable to the world. They don't, they merely leach value from others. 
Bitcoin does the same, mining doesn't create any value, it merely institutes a system of trust. Bitcoins actual value comes from leaching incumbent wealth holders who have themselves leached it from the commons. 
This is admittedly the Marxist viewpoint but to believe otherwise is to believe that cryptocurrency is additive to the current economy. It is to believe as the inflationists do that you can create value from nothing. You can't. Economists are not exempt from the second law of thermodynamics. All capitalism is arbitrage and bitcoin is no different in this respect. This also makes it perfectly fair game in a capitalist construct, you win sometimes, you lose sometimes, some much bigger than others. Most of it has to do with pure luck, if you think otherwise you're likely suffering from confirmation bias.

The beauty of bitcoin is that once you sell them they are expensive and hard to get back. That's why I'm not worried about "bitcoin billionaires". It's easy to make fiat because it's not worth much, not so with bitcoin. Once the cheap bitcoin are gone they're gone. In this way bitcoin exploits human greed to *everyone's* advantage, it rewards the holders more than the sellers.

Only with fiat. It's not possible to hoard bitcoin to the same extent as fiat. Right now a very small group of wealth holders (The famed "1%") could flood the market with fiat but even if Satoshi himself sold all his bitcoin it would only move markets a few percentage points. As more coins are mined it lowers the concentration that any one party holds. Printing more fiat does not do the same because incumbent wealth holders always get first access to it. Bitcoin thus minimizes wealth disparity and prevents liquidity traps such as the one we are experiencing at present. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:16:07

Good question... and yes there are but they are more expensive and thus less common. 
Inkjet would look great on high quality inkjet paper but is not water resistant. *If* however it's printed on photo paper the coating locks the ink in much better and provides a degree of "waterproofing". If not you can laminate them or seal them in bags. Alternatively just cover the codes with transparent packing tape. 
Laser is really idea and provides the best water resistance. Black and white is fine but (obviously) just doesn't look as nice. Color laser is the best of both worlds but I think inkjet still provides the best looking print *if* it's on coated or glossy paper. 
A 3x5 photoprint design would be ideal for inkjet or even lab printing.... the only problem is the potential risk of trusting them with the private key but that might be getting a little paranoid. The cool thing is that you could heat seal them in presized 3x5 sheets. 
Speaking of which how about a business card sized design? 
Edit:

Short term:
Since your background is finance one of the most important things is getting money (or just cash) into bitcoin. On paper this should be simple but in practice it's not. Just ask coinbase. Why not set variable rates based on risk? For example if someone is willing to upload their verification documents like proof of residency, drivers licence, etc. then they should be entitled to the lowest rate. 
Pros: Literaly mountains of money flooding in that you can take a cut off of. We're talking *millions* in profit here, perhaps even billions.
Cons: Short term, the profit stops once the fiat does. Obvious regulatory issues, etc. 
Longer term (sustainable):
A "bank like" wallet: Provide a secure wallet service in exchange for providing transaction insurance depending on client risk and transaction risk. May also include traditional debit card services for an added fee, not unlike OKpay cards. 
Pros: Lots of customers want to know that they are protected by their bank for purchases and other losses. It's also a sustainable business model which does not just temporarily leach off the fiat system. 
Cons: It's insurance so it's obviously risky and expensive but by controlling the software you may be able to mitigate risk by integrating customer pins, signatures, contracts, or even photo evidence of the transaction or even encouraging clients to use low risk and low (or no) fee prescreened merchants. In return you could potentially guarantee transactions in network without needed to go through to block chain for verification. 
"Universal Wallet" service: Similar to a bank like service but lower risk. Provide instantly verified transactions by holding in network reserves with a large number of other Wallet providers. Additional services could include instant transfer or integration with other crypto currencies. 
Pros: Instant verification for both merchants and customers. 
Cons: Potentially reversible transactions, "paypal like" mitigation but this should be minimal since transactions clear the block chain in 10 minutes or so. Liquid reserve requirements with participating wallets or cryptos but no cash reserves thus no fiat deprecation to worry about. 
Payment remittance, conversion, "Gyft on steroids", Why not a simple bill pay service that takes bitcoin and releases a traditional check or money order payment drawn off your account for a small fee? Optionally payments could be made electronically. Money exchanges like Moneygram already have arrangements with many utility providers which might make this less costly and complicated. Obviously gift card sales are big but they need to be faster and at a customer set rate. The hard part is selling private issue gift cards which requires deep integration into the merchants own POS systems. I'm actually looking into such services myself. 
The hard part of most of these isn't the technology but the business partnerships needed with merchants. In the case of gift card sales they are essentially giving a certain level of access to their systems which is basically a credit line from which they expect to be promptly paid back for. The other problem is reconciling and transferring fiat to crypto in the fastest and most efficient way in order to avoid arbitrage losses.

Yes and no. I can tell you one thing however: *None* of the above will happen overnight. All changes are relative. It could go to $2000 tomorrow and people will never remember that day if it goes to 100k or a million. 
I'm of the "opinion" that it can only go up but the reason for that isn't really opinion but actually *fact*: Fiat is inflationary and bitcoin is deflationary. Now if the opposite turns out to be true then it's just as likely that the sun will never rise tomorrow.

Gox isn't doing fractional reserve banking. They can't. End of story. It's an absurd notion because if they were it would be debasing bitcoin and that's quite clearly not what's happening. The only people complaining about this are those that are trying to take valuable bitcoins and exchange them out for valueless paper. By doing so they are *themselves* debasing bitcoin.
Furthermore if they *were* then what/will happen is simple: People will transfer their coins to other institutions and stop doing business with Gox and they will fail on their own merit (or rather lackthereof). Bitcoins are a free market, Gox is not oppressing you. Besides there's no shortage of people that want to buy your bitcoins with fiat, quite the contrary. Coinbase for example is practically *begging* to pay you fiat for your coins, that's why they let you sell several times more than what a new user can buy.

Perhaps it would even allow the user to set a monthly budget and automatically suggest when the user should choose a paid view? Why haven't micro payments caught on? I suspect because people hate dealing with a third party. These are perfect applications for bitcoin.

Interesting. I *was* bullish on gold and probably still am over the longer term but I'm starting to think it would make a much better hedge against cryptos in general. Cryptos will probably let some of the steam out of gold. Make no mistake, while similar they definitely are different beasts. Gold is too easy to manipulate since it can't be "inventoried" like bitcoin can and of course it's a pain in the ass to "spend". Decent store of value but bad currency. Regardless *always* take physical delivery if you're getting into metals.

These really are just wedge issues. I'm a big supporter of all *legitimate* cryptos and feel that they all add monetary redundancy and may help control blockchain sizes. From a speculative standpoint there little reason for all of them not to do well. All will suck value from fiat and there's way more than enough market cap for everyone.

I've read the critiques and they are weak to say the least. You can pick literally anything in the universe and critique it to death but when all is said and done bitcoin is still *more* perfect than anything else. 
The only one that might hold weight is the security and bug issue but even then I'm not seeing it. Everything I've read suggests that the code isn't inherently complex and certainly doesn't have the number of attack vectors as say an operating system nor is it very difficult to secure with anything more than basic domain specific knowledge. I mean look at the potential gain should someone manage to "crack" bitcoin? Don't you think we'd have seen this when there were merely ten of millions if not hundreds of millions at stake? Humans are greedy and one of the most powerful aspects of bitcoin is that it exploits human greed for the greater good.  
I'd also add that there's a misconception that gold's mining effort is constant, it's not. It's increasingly more difficult as well and there are many papers that support this. Just as with bitcoin all the "easy" gold has already been had.

Nope. 10% max and furthermore only *once*.

That's not how it works. Even if he has a million coins and sells them all off he can only move the price less than 10%, The longer he waits the less he can move the price. Furthermore you can only do this *once*. Once the coins are sold you can't get them back. There's just no inventive to do this because you can never buy them back for less than you paid for them. Bitcoin simply cannot be gamed, any appearance to the contrary is simply volatility and represents a market out of equilibrium. But day traders you say? They're selling for fiat that's worth *less* by the day, they just can't see it because they fail to see anything past the nose on their face.

Bitcoin cannot be a bubble because bitcoin is a currency, not a stock. Here's why:
Simply put there is 10,895 *billion* in dollars floating around and only 15 billion in bitcoins. Which one looks like a bubble to you? Hint: That's a comma, not a decimal point. 
tl:dr: Add a few more zeros to the bitcoin market cap and we'll talk bubbles. Bitcoins could rise to $10,000 or even $100,000 and would still not be a bubble. Furthermore no single person can crash the market. Even if Satoshi himself sold all his bitcoins it would only move the price down a few percent.

The important point to land is that you will still be *richer* than otherwise. One of bitcoins main features is it's wealth redistribution effect. That means eventually poor people won't be *as* poor and rich people won't be *as* rich. Not even Satoshi can be as rich as the richest person today.

@_date: 2013-12-27 06:49:36
No. There's no "new elite" with bitcoin. Any illusion of such is temporary because not all the coins are mined. As such their proportional wealth *will* decrease. Furthermore once you spend coin you will *never* get it back unless you make a genuine economic contribution *greater* than it's original value. The "greed effect" causes the newly "rich" to get rid of coins faster than they might get rid of fiat but it's always to their long term disadvantage because fiat will always be worth less. (This is why day trading is a bad idea) Of course it's always to the advantage of those who receive their coin because the distribution is now increased. 
Unlike fiat one holding bitcoins will never be *proportionally* richer than they are now. That is to say their *percentage* of the total wealth will never increase. Contrast this with fiat billionaires who see returns much greater than average and thus are able to easily increase their proportional holdings year to year. This is *despite* the fact that dollars are deflationary. The "bitcoin billionaire" on the other hand will only get proportionally *poorer* as they spend coin. Their *only* means of wealth increase is coin deflation but this will never be in perpetuity because currency arbitrage eventually reaches equilibrium and stops. At this point their wealth can only decease but as this happens the wealth of others can only *increase*.  It is by this method that bitcoin actually promotes wealth equality to those truly deserving of the wealth and discourages wealth disparity based on usury.

 &gt; He's a bitcoin evangelist!
No, the opposite.  Bitcoin is deflationary not *inflationary*. Don't misunderstand me. It only *appears* to be inflating next to the dollar but that's only because the dollar is *deflating* against bitcoin. 
We're in this mess due to inflating the dollar, you don't get out of it by inflating it further. Bitcoin is self correcting. In fact it and other cryptos have the ability to correct the economy themselves just by continuing to deflate the dollar. But it has a long, long, long, way to go if it is to do that. Bitcoin would need 10's if not hundreds of trillions of dollars in additional market cap to do this.

It's complicated but it basically looks like a crytograhicly signed "crowd sourced" mitigation process except that the members of the "crowd" themselves are trusted.... trusted by whom I'm not exactly sure, I guess it depends on the protocol and design. 
Example: Party A, B, C, D, E all control (all own and administer) account X (via a large company, organization, etc.). None are allowed to move money without a specified number of approvals depending on the amount requested: Perhaps A must approve of *all* transaction but A plus anyone else can approve transactions under 500 "currency units". Transactions over 1000 must be Approved by A, B, &amp;, C. Transactions over 10000 must be approved by all. In the event that A dies or is otherwise incapacitated than a "vote" to release A might be possible but only at a certain date or time. The possibilities can become quite complex.

The problem with services like Square and SalesVu is that they have primarily modeled their business around providing credit card transactions. That means they would likely want to charge a fee for bitcoin transactions that you could likely do for free on a traditional POS system. *However* you would also need a merchant account through your bank for credit cards, on the upside they might charge less than these services. 
Charging a fee for bitcoin isn't necessarily a problem if you feel their integrated solution still represents good value to you but of course bitpay themselves charges a fee. If you can drop bitpay this might be worth it. I suspect these services will be doing exactly this soon.

Right now they don't believe that it will ever become a serious currency mostly because they believe strongly in the current financial system. Economists and The Fed has been extremely successful in promoting the status quo thus far. 
But I fully expect them to start to shit their pants once the market cap starts getting "serious". That means the hundreds of billions if not *trillions*. If it surpasses even 1% of global holdings then it's panic mode. Much more than that and they shut the internet down.... or try to. Expect The Fed to vastly increase QE before that happens and also expect bitcoins to trade at around 10k-100k. We still have a while before that happens.

Yes. Bitcoins stability is proportional to the percentage of fiat the currency displaces. That is the stability will only increase. Trade will eventually be priced in bitcoin if/when it's market cap significantly displaces even a small percentage of fiat. 
The question overall is meaningless because it assumes that bitcoin is the cause for market variability and not markets *themselves*. When the market price of *anything* rises or falls nobody blames the currency for not being stable because that would be absurd.

Ignore fiat currencies for a moment. This is of course possible but this distribution should be far less steep. For example I'd say it's improbable for even the top 1% to own more than 10% of the coins which would be somewhere over a million coins. This will fall further as more coins are discovered. Note that we're not concerned with the total *amount* of wealth which can very but merely the distribution.
*Now* extrapolate the declining value of fiat against the rising value of bitcoin and things start to get interesting. All the sudden the fiat rich aren't so rich anymore. They can try to buy as many coins as they want but it's ultimately self defeating with the accelerating exchange value.

This has been a problem with bitcoin even from it's conception. The geeks didn't even understand the theory of money which is a giant barrier if you're trying to *build* a system of money! Nor do the users for that mater.  I'm not a programmer but I understand technology, cryptography, and monetary systems. It takes yet another person or group to make the technology transparent and easy to use. That's where we're at now. Both Gates and Jobs saw the power of the personal computer but they needed to make it usable for everyone. It's the big picture visionary that will bring all these layers together but the beauty is that they will all be inter-operable and give the customer not only the freedom of platform but true monetary freedom for the first time in centuries.

That's a myopic view and it's one that's not possible with bitcoin because it's self correcting. If no one spends it the price falls. Why do you think million dollar homes exist? The simple reason is that *someone* is willing to pay a million dollars. If no one buys it then it's overpriced or the seller just doesn't want to sell. Effectively that would mean it's not for sale. Lets say I go out and buy a new car and the dealer wants a trillion dollars for it. Do you honestly think the dealership would be in business? If so are you seriously suggesting that there's people lining up around the block to pay a trillion dollars? 
Second of all *everyone* requires a base level of consumption. I just spent $27 on groceries last night. Was it "irrational" for me to do that rather than buying bitcoin? Or would it be *more* irrational to starve to death waiting for the price to rise?
The simple fact is that bitcoin really *is* the "trillion dollar car" because people really *are* lining up around the block to buy it. Anyone who disagrees either doesn't understand markets or is confusing bitcoin with a stock. It's a currency, not a stock. It *literately* can't be a bubble because it's not an inflationary currency.  You know what *can* be a bubble? The dollar. Need proof? Look how many it takes to buy a bitcoin now. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 08:24:57


Nope. I hear this argued all the time but it's not correct. It's not bitcoin millionaires that are responsible for wealth disparity, it's the fiat billionaires. Bitcoin promotes redistribution but it's just not apparent yet. The bitcoin wealthy are merely arbitraging fiat from the fiat wealthy, not the poor. Their own greed will prompt them to sell eventually but even if it doesn't it won't mater because their number of bitcoin is always finite. 
It's the *percentage* they hold and not it's exchange value that maters. They will never have proportionally more than they have right now. In fact as new coins are mined they will have *less* as a total percentage of world wealth. Contrast that with the fiat system where incumbent wealth holders will always *increase* their percentage of wealth.  
Why would the elite want to support a system which can only make them less rich? They won't.

In a round about way this is actually a *good* thing because it shows that banks are in fact anti-competitive which further supports the case for bitcoin. 
I really don't care if the markets are "startled" or not, believe me, I have my own positions. A fart in the wind "startles" the markets but none of this can change the fundamentals. If you think it can then you have no business being in bitcoin at all. In spite of this the facts are the facts and it is not at all irrational for banks to crack down on bitcoin. If you think it is then you are under the illusion that the banking system is a fair and free market. If it *was* then we wouldn't be having discussion and we certainly wouldn't need bitcoin nor would it have ever been invented.

I care but I'm not "concerned", not *yet* at least. Bitcoin is still seen as an amusing side show rather than a serious threat to the financial status quo. Once the market cap surges the monied elite will start to shit themselves because it will necessarily mean that bitcoins will start gaining value at the expense of other currencies. 
This means that they will have two very bad options, either take their existing losses and get into bitcoin or stay out of bitcoin and lose more. Of course getting into bitcoin means that the overall faith in the current financial system will start to crumble. Thus team "too big to fail" starts lobbying the government for "regulation" rather than taking the hit and getting into the bitcoin game themselves. This would of course be effectively a backdoor bailout.  They've *always* played dirty, why stop now? 
I don't know when this will happen but probably won't until (if?) bitcoin market cap hits at least 1% of world wealth holdings (not to be confused with GDP). I predict this will mean at least a several hundred billion dollar market cap for bitcoin or perhaps a few trillion. This could take years or it could happen fast but will probably still happen. You also can't ignore other crypto currencies, they could steal some thunder from bitcoin but that won't stop the rise much, merely slow it. It's not a bad idea to be diversified in other cryptos if their fundamentals are similar.

You could be an unemployed neck beard and as long as you clean up well they'll put you on as an "internet currency expert" then it's all "Joining us now is ~~some yahoo we found on Reddit~~ Brazen Amberite to talk about bitcoin...... now you've been in this space a long time. Let me ask you......"
You'll find that most of these people have no notable credentials (or are pushing their own agenda, selling books, web sites, etc.) but have made a hobby out of media whoring.

It's a hosted virtual machine. Advantages include faster bandwidth and no upfront hardware investment. Since it's hosted off site it might also be more reliable. Disks may or may not also be redundant. There are other advantages as well such as being able to move the "machine" between providers since the quality between providers tends to very. 
They are a good way to put "hardware" online without having to actually order, install, or maintain any hardware. You get to control the whole software environment yourself as it if were an actual machine and pay only for the resources you actually need/use.

@_date: 2013-12-24 08:07:27
You can approach this from two ways. Either they are completely stupid and actually believe their own monetary bullshit in which case that's the end of this story. 
Or they know that bitcoin is a real threat. In this case it's best to ignore it and hope it goes away. This is actually the smartest thing to do for the time being and proves that maybe they *aren't* stupid. But then when was the last time government was proactive on anything?
The problem is this will only "work" for so long. As soon as the market cap starts hitting a few hundred billion then it starts chipping away at the dollar. (There's actually so much fiat that this might take a few trillion... who knows.)  The longer this goes on the more likely they are to go into "panic mode" and start drastic measures. Not sure what these might be but they will only have limited effectiveness. Drastic measures of course lead to more drastic measures which may include cutting off internet access to the worst "offenders". 
By this point hopefully technologies like mastercoin are more widely implemented which can eliminate the need for centralized exchanges. Either way the fiat continues to flood into bitcoin. The large holders might even get cold feet and start accepting hard assets like gold for bitcoin thus if you can get your hands on gold then you can still buy bitcoins. (The protocol is quite beautiful in that it takes advantage of human greed to accelerate the redistribution of bitcoin and wealth itself.)
But what *then*? Dollars and other fiats become slowly devalued... or maybe more quickly. One just really can't predict how fast a fiat sell off accelerates. It could happen so fast that that governments nearly go bankrupt "overnight", libertarians rejoice!  It could of course happen more slowly. The fiat holdouts and those who depend on the state could experience more pain.... but then they are already. Many people won't understand what's actually happening because their faith in fiat (even if they don't even know what this is) will be unshaken. Even right now most continue to believe that the economy will pick up and that if they just "hang in there" things will get better, they are unwittingly preserving the status quo and lengthening their own pain. The difference is that unlike today the power to stop this will be within their own reach. The world around them will have already begun changing. They will simply have to acknowledge the fact that "there is no spoon". 
The redistribution effect of bitcoin might however lessen this pain and the accompanying existential crisis. We might actually see *real* trickle down which causes the "money multiplier" effect to really kick in. This could cause people to confuse it with a conventional economic recovery. The economic news however won't support this, it will be all doom and gloom since anyone still invested in fiat will be bleeding money..... or not. The Fed could pump out so much QE that's it's not even noticeable on paper but the exchange rate won't lie. Or again maybe not since the dollar will only be judged against other fiats which *themselves* will be dropping against cryptos. It will however be hard to notice the fiat inflation. Perhaps they will become even better at hiding reality from themselves? I sure hope so. 
The best outcome would be for the government to simply become completely irrelevant without even realizing it. That is no wars, no panics, no totalitarian uprisings. Maybe lots of people (including public servants) just completely up and quit their jobs? Poverty and social problems start to evaporate simply because governments stop trying to fix something that's no longer broken. A new renaissance? Carbon emissions start drastically declining because people no longer have the *need* or desire to work 40+ hours a week?  Why it's almost like psychopaths simply go broke and are no longer able to control the world! 
The really amazing part is that this might be a feasible possibility. But who knows how long it will take? Years, decades? It just depends how exponential the adoption rate is or continues to be. It's *that* part that's unpredictable and potentially painful.

I have no idea what your setup is but if it's like most small businesses you have POS with either integrated CC/debit processing *or* a separate card machine. Even if you use the card machine it still goes through the POS. So why not just track employee sub accounts on the POS before running the transaction on bitpay? 
The main downside is if employees prefer to keep their tips in bitcoin.

Yes and no. *All* cryptos are way too small to cannibalize each other.

This doesn't concern me in the least, cryptos for everyone! 
@_date: 2013-11-14 07:07:49
It doesn't mater. The price is self regulating by the very fact that there's only a finite amount you can hold. People still require the basics like food and shelter. They ain't going to give those up for bitcoin and thus this still creates equilibrium. If it floods out the price will drop but that's not happening, quite the contrary.  For this to be true you have to explain why the dollar *isn't* a bubble considering the majority of holdings will *never* be spent?  Where's all the concern that billionaires are going to out and flood the market with dollars. They own *most* of them anyway but they seem to be in no mood to crash the market for their own holdings.

Nice commentary. All true but this should smooth out some as more coins are found. I think the important point is that incumbent coin holders can't directly leverage their holdings for more coins. Of course they can via mining investment but not anywhere near to the extent of fiat currency holders since the difficulty is always increasing. That is to say that while they're rich they can't get exponentially richer than any other holder of bitcoin.

But it won't always be this way because it's much easier to spend a BTC than to get it back. This is often forgotten because the exchange rate is moving so fast. Contrast that with fiat, it's easy to get back (via usury) so it doesn't spread around very easily. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 09:53:39
Make no mistake. This isn't normal, it's totally fucked up but it's the only way they can possibly reverse $4+ *trillion* in QE they've pumped in without tanking the entire economy. Of course they could have avoided this by not doing QE in the first place but that would not have made banks and wallstreet richer. 
This is basically another way of causing natural deflation which is of course torture to banks. The message is "if you don't spend some of your god damned money we're going to take it from you." Their greed is literally causing a liquidity trap and stalling the entire economy. Simply put there's no money left for anyone else because they already *have* all of it. An economy doesn't work without the exchange of goods and services. No exchange equals no jobs, no demand, no spending, etc. 
Now people saying "bitcoin doesn't work because nobody is spending it" are full of shit. The exact same thing applies to fiat right now. The difference is that there isn't hundreds of trillions of dollars in bitcoin floating around doing nothing right now.

Second the ultimately larger distribution method will be via traditional trade rather than currency arbitrage. Arbitrage is merely a side effect of fiat being *under* valued rather than cryptos being *over* valued in the market. That is to say that fiat is the *real* bubble where as crypto is the exact opposite.

Misleading?! Ha! If you had even *suggested* quantitative easing a decade ago any economist would have said you're full of shit and laughed you out of the room. Now we're over $4 trillion in with no end in sight. (The national debt by comparison is "only" 17 trillion.) This is absolutely unprecedented by *any* school of economic thought. This is no "circlejerk", it's called reality. Bias? You don't know the meaning of the word.

True but the beauty is that the ultra wealthy will still end up less weathly overall. They can't possibly buy enough bitcoins to equal the present market value of their fiat

Actually it will be difficult for even him (her?) to amass that much wealth with bitcoin or at least more than a few percent of the total distribution. But I believe this is also by design in order to minimize world wealth disparity.

The price goes up because the value of fiat goes down. This isn't yet noticeable because there's literally hundreds of trillions of dollars of fiat on the markets but only a few billion of bitcoins. Bitcoin and other cryptos will slowly leech all that value out. Bitcoin will have to surge hundreds of times to even hit $1 trillion.

As it *should* be but make no mistake that when the time comes you're not going to want to be holding fiat. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:12:56
True but it actually applies *less* to bitcoin especially overtime. There's still more coins to be found but incumbent coin holders have no direct advantage over anyone else in finding them where as fiat holders do.
It's like to also posit is psychological theory, That is that bitcoin holders are less likely to be greedy phycopaths. There's nothing you can buy for a $100 billion dollars that you can't buy with a billion dollars. Even if there is the "poor" billionaire doesn't live any worse than the rich one. So why not just retire already? It's a dick measuring contest, nothing more.  
@_date: 2013-12-24 08:38:49
Tax is already collected at the point of sale. The fact that the amount collected is pegged in dollars is irrelevant. Dollars will *always* have an exchange rate even if it turns out to be zero. In fact this is even less relevant in cases where a *percentage* is collected. Furthermore bitcoin has the likelihood of *raising* tax revenue since the rich don't pay as much tax nor buy very much which is the main reason why tax revenue is so low right now.

My biggest complaint is that it took like 4 days verify my bank account. I was a little concerned because they said they didn't recognize my routing number (I use a credit union). Alas their deposits finally came through today. Could it be I'm the first one at my bank to make a coinbase transfer? 
@_date: 2013-12-24 09:06:50
They can't move the market easily, they can only *scare* the market easily. The market is simply irrational if they think one person can crash the market with even a few million coins. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 10:32:29
The problem is that even with "free" money they can't make money so they need to change you money just for *having* money at all. This shouldn't come as shock in an industry that exists only the fleece the public.

The irony is that bitcoin would never be this high if they hadn't debased the currency but of course in that case we wouldn't *need* bitcoin.

That's only because of their current monopoly on money. This is only temporary until everyone has and takes bitcoin. Even Gyft recognizes that their service would be greatly undermined if/when more businesses take bitcoin directly. 


That's only because their suppliers don't yet take bitcoin. This won't be necessary once they do.

Or "OMG I have millions of dollars but how do I "cash" it out without having the tax man get me?!?". The answer is of course that bitcoin is it's *own* currency, you don't *have* to cash it out. But then I guess that's just not as cool as making it rain at the strip club.

This is indeed an advantage but it might be overstated. Realistically just how many confirmations do you need for it to be more secure than a credit card? (And no, chargebacks/forwards are *not* ever guaranteed.) 
@_date: 2013-12-12 06:16:14
I disagree. This is only true in the short term. Over the long term more fiat will flow in then flows out. Of course I would prefer the permanent investment but ultimately they will only make money off those that sell short and by selling sort you *deserve* to lose. 
Keep in mind that all this wealth already exists, the markets only make it change hands. It can move wherever it wants but it can't change the fundamentals. Fiat is ultimately worthless, anyone speculating for dollars is ignoring this simple fact. They are quite literally playing for nothing more than monopoly money. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 09:34:05

Don't be stupid. They aren't doing this. If they were the sell limit would be lower than the buy limit. The "liquidity crunch" your referring to was not being able to get enough *coins*, it has nothing to do with not having the fiat for them. You know because bitcoins are scarce by design.

It's funny how poor people hoard but rich people "invest". You don't hear about billionaires or Apple "hoarding" their money but that's exactly what they're doing.

@_date: 2013-11-16 07:23:22
I don't think you've said anything substantial here or perhaps just not very clearly. You're implying that the distribution is inherently appropriated "correctly". 
I don't even believe that bitcoin insures a "correct" distribution but merely a *more* "correct" one. That is to say that I believe bitcoin secures it's value by re-appropriating wealth from incumbent wealth holders at the expense of the current fiat regime.

The price will hit $1000 and it will still be the same tune. It's just a bunch of economists whining that bitcoin doesn't follow the "fundamentals" as if they had some kind of grasp on reality in the first place.
