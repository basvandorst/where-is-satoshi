Jesus it's just a present. A lame present, but it's not like he gave them 0.01 bitcorns.

Simple, they just mine all of the GoogleCoins before they offer them as a payment system for their own services.

Were you here when that "study" was launched? It wasn't supposed to be a study. 
Every MIT student was supposed to receive 100 dollars, to encourage innovation. Instead it became an opt-in survey.
"Students who receive 100 dollars in bitcoin tend to spend that on food and gift cards instead of hodling" doesn't tell you anything about how people in general are using the currency.

It's either the act of spoiled children, or adults who have a vested financial interest in Bitcoin that are threatened by Apple's actions.
It's possible that there are deeper motivations, but that's how it scans for observers.

Someone sold about ten million dollars worth of bitcoin without specifying the price, all of the sell orders were immediately filled and the price temporarily plunged.

The point of bitcoin is that it's a decentralized currency. You suddenly want the advantages of centralization when it suits your purposes? 
@_date: 2014-05-11 01:20:39
My theory is that you are a moron.

Parody, technically.

If I were a donor I'd want to see some hard numbers about exactly where the money has been spent.
@_date: 2014-11-22 09:18:46
That's true, but since it's a constant factor it doesn't explain fluctuations in selling.
@_date: 2014-10-01 00:46:54
Don't be so butthurt. Satire and parody are very similar, I wasn't trying to ashame you by pointing out the difference.
@_date: 2014-11-30 08:46:11






This is exactly why people make fun of your community.
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:41:46
You know about Bitcoin, and know someone called Satoshi Nakamoto and you never figured out before now? Bullshit.
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:42:05
It's exactly like it's competitors, it just offers a different bias.

He is agreeing with you on principle and wishing you good luck, but he's been downvoted to the lowest post in this thread because he pointed out negative personal experiences and challenges facing the real world use of magic beans. Classic.

His point is that by taking the bet, you're propping up an embarrassingly bad exchange that would go out of business faster otherwise. The longer Gox is propped up by speculators, the worse Bitcoin appears to the general public.
@_date: 2014-01-17 22:33:41


Bitcoin has never been illegal, what's your point?
@_date: 2014-11-11 21:05:40
I thought the point was that *all* MIT students were going to receive bitcoin, the idea being that it might stimulate some otherwise indifferent tech genius to develop an innovative application. This seemed like a brilliant idea.
Turns out it's some kind of opt-in survey? What is the point?
@_date: 2014-04-04 16:57:39


If he approved of bitcoin, he would be celebrated here as a genius who can see the future.

His point is that there's apparently no such thing as bad news when bitcoin is involved. It reveals a cognitive bias on the part of the True Believers.

Yes the federal government is quaking in its boots just thinking about this subreddit.

Do you say that because you think his analysis of international trade and the effects of globalisation is deeply flawed? 
@_date: 2014-03-16 12:34:06


Nonsense. Bitcoin would exist if people were just mining on their old laptops, some people spend millions to get a bigger slice of a speculative bubble.
@_date: 2014-01-18 14:23:25


Nobody knows that. A lot of people *feel* it, which isn't the same thing at all.


So these "investors" are basically monkeys who want to place a bet without really knowing what they are doing, yeah that sounds about right.

From the sidebar of this very sub: **Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money.** 
This is what shifting goalposts looks like.

This is where we fundamentally disagree then. The long term benefits, if the underlying asset is genuinely valuable, would have been realized eventually but it would have been a slower process. Bubbles are great at accelerating the process, but the accelerated rate of development does not justify the necessary fact of individuals whose lives are ruined in this process. A minority make huge profits while the average man loses out, all to accelerate something that would have happened more slowly otherwise.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:55:58
You know bubbles are inherently bad things right? I'm amazed to see bitcoin supporters so casually referring to its speculative nature.
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:07:55
OK we'll see how things play out.
@_date: 2013-12-26 20:15:22
Did anybody commenting so far actually read the article? It's highly critical of bitcoin, the information about Li Ka-shing is mentioned only in passing. 
But by all means continue your greed-based irrational circlejerk.
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:18:44
The skyrocketing valuation of bitcoin is greed disguised by political ideology, I am certain that in ten years you will wish you had taken the tulip analogy more seriously.
@_date: 2013-12-26 21:48:58
Just calling it as I see it.

It's also an opportunity to fill a paper bag with money and set it on fire. I wouldn't recommend either.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:31:23
I don't think you understand how bubbles work.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:49:58
So the problem of money according to you is that it is an unstable store of value, but Bitcoin is a better alternative. Is that what you are saying?
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:30:44


People lost their shirts. There's an argument to be made for bubbles having positive long term effects (e.g. fiber infrastructure that is being used now was laid down during the dot com bubble), but they tend to bankrupt the individuals who where participating in the bubble. The people benefiting today are not the same individuals who lost their livelihood when the bubble burst. The people who are "investing" in bitcoin at current price levels won't benefit from whatever cryptocurrency is being used in ten years. 


A lot of people, myself included, have been skeptical about bitcoin's value for much longer than the last few weeks. Cryptocurrencies are a potentially revolutionary system of online payment, but valuing it at thousands of dollars per bitcoin, specifically this cryptocurrency, is insane. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:14:46


The only well studied currencies to date have ultimately had the backing of a sovereign nation that has the ability to tax an economically productive population. Without getting into the ethical legitimacy of taxation, why do you think bitcoin, and specifically bitcoin, will become the de facto cryptocurrency in ten years? 
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:50:45
OK then explain or direct me to a succinct explanation of why bubbles are good in this context, unlike in every other type of asset.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:01:51
Everything you said in your first paragraph was true during the dot com bubble. It still ended up bursting because it was ultimately a speculative bubble where most of the investors thought it would make them rich. 
This is the third bubble I have witnessed first hand and the psychology is identical.
@_date: 2013-12-30 19:33:46
If this was likely, Goldman Sachs et al would be investing in it. Don't invest any money you can't afford to lose, this could easily be a speculative bubble.
@_date: 2013-12-22 14:17:07
FYI you're being downvoted because you sound like a whiny bitch.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:42:13
The dot com bubble burst because the price of stocks was totally unrelated to the underlying value of the assets, but people were deluded by the skyrocketing valuations created by pure speculation. I saw the same thing in the housing bubble and I see the same thing here.
