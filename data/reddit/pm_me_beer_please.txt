Use Gemini instead. Their CS is just as useless, but at least they have lower fees.

I think this post violates the non-aggression principle because it forced me to laugh :)

I spent several weeks waiting on their customer support to find my funds that were missing in the deposit transfer. Enourmously frustrating that they have only email support, and I got zero response. Eventually got desperate, messaged their Facebook page, and then they finally took care of me.
Other than that, good experience.
FWIW, Coinbase has bad customer support too.

I prefer to use Bitcoin Gold, which has the genesis block 000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f, so it is bitcoin as much as any other fork.

Yep. And now is probably a good time to do so, while it's much cheaper again.

Do you want to make a bet on this? In one year I'll buy you a barrel of oil, and you buy me one Bitcoin.
Put your money where your mouth is.

Sorry to disappoint you. None of these people making such remarks ever have the cajones to stand by their words and take the bet.

Technical analysis is voodoo, so don't even bother.

You think BTC's market cap will be ~20 trillion in ten years? Really? Id be happy to sell you call options if you're serious.

How can Nick be Satoshi if we already know that Craig Wright is Satoshi?  ;)

I'll bet you 1 BTC it is not banned in the USA within five years. Put your money where your mouth is.
