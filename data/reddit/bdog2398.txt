Hmm it’s a gamble! I think I might wait and see. I won’t loose anything if Its goes back to 3k anyways 
@_date: 2019-04-03 21:14:21
I’m a noob don’t know what any of that means 
@_date: 2019-04-03 18:42:07
What is that?
@_date: 2018-11-09 16:17:13
I guess I’ll have to invest more ugh, it irritates me because I want to buy things with my btc

That’s not the case bro. Any platform you buy from using a US bank will take LONGER. Up to a week! Lost alot of money this past week from them holding my btc for so long!

That’s why I’m using paypal, because most of they time they will refund you if you’d been scammed. Also I’m willing the send a payment first. I’m really just trying to find some help from a fellow redditor :(
@_date: 2018-11-09 16:32:31
Yes my bank is American :(
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:01:26
I swear it’s not I will pay you first and give you whatever credentials. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 20:19:13
Coinbase sucks I’ve used it in the past. I’m gonna try out local bitcoins because it’s the simplest in terms of trading. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 17:05:06
Why is that? 
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:47:48
Thanks for your info bucko but you really don’t know what your talking about. I already found someone who was willing to trade anyways from here. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 17:04:15
What do I use instead? 
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:07:42
Because if I buy using my bank (US) from a platform, it will take a week for me to be able to actually use by btc. If I can do it through someone directly, I can use it instantly :)
