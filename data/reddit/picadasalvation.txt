Indeed it is, one of the five I personally invest in

Trials and Tribble-ations

I’ve never made anything from it, about a fivers worth of Bitcoin in my Bitconnect account.
@_date: 2018-01-30 10:15:36
Purely for free transactions to my hardware wallet through GDAX for myself 
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:39:58
iOS version?
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:55:39
I guess I’m from a dodgier part of the UK then haha because it’s easy as fuck here
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:26:08
Obviously it’s me! See I was gonna announce myself to the world when BTC hit $10000 but like a twat I lost my private key for the genesis block so have decided to remain anonymous. /s

Wait, he doesn’t look like me... er I mean... he doesn’t look like what I imagine Satoshi does
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:10:14
Fair enough I will leave it then
@_date: 2018-01-30 13:49:10
Fair enough, ultimately my understanding is clearly flawed. Can you explain to me why this wouldn’t work?
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:44:07
Ah cool thank you :)
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:23:15
Tell me about it, woke up this morning to multiple failed attempts to log into my Blockchain wallet. Had been waiting for fees to drop to transfer out but took the hit today
@_date: 2018-01-25 08:52:06
In fairness trading Ethereum has me up 60%
@_date: 2018-01-12 06:31:24
You can find the same ones on Amazon for only a few GBP
@_date: 2018-01-29 07:03:49
Agreed, I don’t wanna take away from the achievement but the age thing annoys me too. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:15:45
Yeah I’ve only put in what I would have spent on cigarettes anyway so...
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:39:57
GreenAddress is fantastic :) also Ledger Nano S is honesty not that expensive. If you have the £75 in crypto that the Ledger costs then you should own one
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:21:36
If you have a 3DS check out Market Crashers (also known as Streetpass Traders I’d like me you are in England).
It’s a great stock market mini game and actually teaches you how to read things like candlestick charts
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:48:20
So I have a raspberry pi 2 doing not a lot. Any decent upto date guides to run a full node on it?
@_date: 2018-01-30 10:14:38
I’m not sure and this is pure speculation but do they do their own mining and confirm their own transactions thus ultimately costing them nothing?
@_date: 2018-01-28 08:15:35
I’ll sign up in a bit
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:38:18
Local lol
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:26:20
If you are also from the UK then you know as well as the rest of us how easy it is to obtain prescription drugs without a prescription 
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:10:08
Oh nice one pal, good work! Also Happy New Year
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:54:22
I have tried this and never got anywhere with it. Maybe if you have some time we can have a discussion and see where I am going wrong?
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:33:20
You can transfer to GDAX for free and from there send to any Bitcoin address free of fees
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:46:06
I bought my Ledger after my crypto holdings exceeded the cost of buying a Ledger 
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:20:30
Ah that will be why
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:56:47
Yes 
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:48:35
I chose the Ledger myself because it supports all the AltCoins I am invested in aswell as BTC whereas the Trezor did not
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:02:58
Depends how much you have, if a lot then  sweep away into Coinbase and then using GDAX you can transfer to your ledger fee free. If you don’t have a lot then wait, fees are outrageous right now
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:32:38
Still far to high for me right now 
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:15:28
Nobody online there :(
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:35:25
Not to my knowledge sorry
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:49:24
I thought Trezor meant Vault in Czech?
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:25:21
Well there’s an offer I have never received before ��
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:23:32
Really? I don’t recall verifying on GDAX
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:45:24
Shortly before Garak blew him up if memory serves
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:49:35
Oh I don’t know, I’m definitely new to this and I’m the same as Mr Bean right now
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:02:45
Anytime, good company and good music
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:09:49
I don’t recall ever verifying GDAX but somebody yesterday said you do need to verify so quite possibly it’s a case of verifying and waiting 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:23:13
I use Coinbase only to buy and move into my ledger through GDAX. Free transactions to my Ledger are why I use them. EDIT: I am also not from the US but thought I’d share my 2 pence
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:54:05
Ah fair play, I’ve been rather ill the last few days so not up to speed
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:39:58
This is exactly what I’ve been saying. Casuals cashing out for Christmas, in the meantime I am HODLing and buying
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:24:06
Use it, test it, try to break it. If you do break it or find unexpected behaviour then report it. Every bit helps
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:29:34
HODL HODL HODL!!! To the moon!
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:52:20
Cheers pal
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:31:16
I move things into GDAX for moving into my Ledger. Maybe I did verify, can’t remember after all this time haha
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:05:45
Anyone panic dropping, feel free to send me a few coin haha 15jH9N5yZT7Lo6dsGAWvunrEYCBPMJ6CfM

More evidence to suggest British in the Genesis Block and his casual use of British slang eg Bloody hard
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:27:44
I’m pretty sure the moon was a water bender

@_date: 2019-01-03 18:31:45
Guys stop sending me Bitcoin, use it for yourselves
@_date: 2018-03-10 11:24:01
I was thinking the same
@_date: 2018-02-20 06:29:57
Why would you say that... here starts a new obsession 
@_date: 2018-02-16 07:06:15
Quarter of a million pounds, will enable me to buy some property and fund my startup
@_date: 2018-04-23 07:00:33
I have no problem with Coinbase for purchasing. However BTC gets bought and immediately transferred to my Ledger so...
