I'm almost 21, I don't need a felony on my record it's okay if I need to tough out a 0.25% fee from an exchange or just trading equities instead. New York is just doing a huge disservice to themselves, crypto and in all fairness, the exchanges are being a bit greedy all considered.

1%?! For one trade?! No way I would ever do that, I don't care what kind of execution they have. Gemini and Coinbase might have high fees but 1% on a single trade is way too much. Unless you're swing trading or holding you'd lose a 15-second trade under normal circumstances.

Lmao, as someone who's been a owner/developer in the past I know that feeling- I still wouldn't be the first person to use it cause of how I do things. Also, legally speaking its kind of iffy.

OP here.
 [ There is a list of all the companies currently holding NY's BitLicense. 
I'm looking into BitFlyer, see if they're any good. Their fees look wayyyy better and the volume is pretty decent.

Kraken doesn't operate within NY sadly.

Gemini is better than Coinbase in terms of functionality and integrity but both platforms fees are getting outrageous. It makes me wish I could use Kraken, Bitfinex, Binance and so on. Really looking for a better alternative but I don't think one exists, seems like trading in NY is kind of shitty.

Is there really no better alternative cause I feel like I'm trading for a prop fund when I'm on these exchanges, it's kind of ridiculous.

Still relatively small from what I’ve seen.
