All segwit enabled coins can launch their own LN. I guess I will be banned for altcoin promotion if I want to address your second paragraph, which is complete nonsense.

To get 50$ out of an exchange you need like 10-20$. It really makes no sense to do it. Unless you like burning money

Paid 350 sat/byte. 20 blocks and still not confirmed. I used segwit address.

It's not an exception. Just my opinion. Can you imagine how full the blockchain would be if the 200k+ new daily users really did not used exchanges as wallets?

I paid 10$ yesterday for segwit tx and it was not confirmed within 20 blocks. Think will not get better. Some prominent off-chain scaling supporters expect fees to hit 100$-1000$ .

Are you saying you sold your BTC, waited for a month, then bought BCH? Your story makes no sense if you look at the price charts. If you sold at 5400$ you must have bought BCH at ~300$

If that's real you are really unlucky. If I were you I would just stick with my initial read and not go back. But that's just me, you should not listen to financial advices from random stranger on the internet

Unprecedented? Are you living under a rock?

Opening a channel might cost 100-1000$ if the fee increase trend continue. LN is not what it seams. I expect newbies just to buy on Coinbase, keep their funds there, then Coinbase to have channels with other big hubs and use LN to reduce costs. They will not be able to send bulk payments to other exchange onchain to reduce costs because bulk payments will be outlawed (the beauty of being regulated). 
I hope you understand what you are "buying" with LN

Bulk transfers ban is part of Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Amendment Bill 2017.
