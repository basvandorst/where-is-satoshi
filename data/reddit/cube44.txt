I️ think it’s likely going to continue to rise the way I️t has been and I’ll probably wish I sold later, but I’ll never know how late is too late and it’s safest for me to sell now.

Another ”what about ___”. This has nothing to do with aviation. This doesn’t even have to do with morals or the environment. I'm not boycotting bitcoin, I'm selling my bitcoin for now and if it ever looks like a viable and sustainable currency again I'll buy back in. My argument is that the energy consumption poses a scalability problem to bitcoin. If it were to ever be used as it was intended, as a currency and not an investment (although I don't have a problem with making money), then the number of transactions would result in such high energy costs for miners that the fees would be too high. Unless bitcoin's scaling problems get fixed I'm staying out. That doesn't mean boycotting.

Still a silly measurement. The fact is that mining wastes a ridiculous amount of energy, and there’s no good way to justify it. Every argument I’ve heard starts with “what about _______? _______ uses a ton of energy too.” Of course there are other wastes of energy out there, none of them justify bitcoin mining.

Of course things both you and I use/do require energy usage. I’m not arguing we shouldn’t use energy. Bitcoin mining uses more energy than 159 COUNTRIES. You can’t tell me that isn’t a tremendous waste, definitely more so than you or I’s phone use.

I’m not upset about it at all. But I do feel that it provides somewhat of an accurate look into the mentality that’s driving the price, and that mentality makes me uneasy enough to quit.

All I was saying is that untill it's fixed I'm holding out. No need to get upset or claim I'm boycotting bitcoin. I still support it and hope it does well in the long term but I think we're overdue a big correction.

Move slowly and spread it out over a number of transactions. I know I’m not selling at the top, and I’m sure it’ll continue to rise and I’ll wish I would’ve sold later, but right now I’m glad I’m out. I can miss out on some gains for a little peace of mind.

If it was found in a geocache I'm sure it's been redeemed but still an incredibly lucky find!

I somehow manage to continually underestimate bitcoin while still being bullish. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 19:29:57
This makes a lot of sense. 
So my next question is, how do I ensure that I don't loose my BTC in the case that there is a temporary split? Is it better to just sell and stay out of the situation entirely?

Everytime I try to explain it to my parents my dad shakes his head and goes "fake money! I don't like it!"

Your bitcoin balance won't change unless you buy/sell bitcoin. 1 BTC will always be 1 BTC. However, bitcoins value relative to the US dollar (or any other currency) does change over time. 
If you bought 1 BTC at $2000/BTC, and the price falls to $1000/BTC, then you lost $1000 worth of value but you still have the same amount of bitcoin.

Exactly. It's already seemed to have leveled off. If it continues to dip again it won't be very far.

Trying to understand this stuff as a new user who also is learning English must be very confusing. A lot of this stuff sounds like a different language to native English speakers.

If I have all my coins in coinbase should I be okay? Or would it be better to transfer them to a paper or hardware wallet? 
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:51:01
Here's a similar question but not directly related to OP's situation: I bought bitcoin from coinbase on May 24th, and it still says processing. Is this normal? How long until I receive the coins?
@_date: 2017-06-11 00:13:57
When I try to explain bitcoin to people, they often assume you can only buy bitcoins as a whole, and they assume when I buy bitcoin I'm literally spending thousands a day.
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:02:04
That's a neat observation.

So if my plan is to buy and hold I'll be fine?

The graph on mobile only shows the price at specific intervals. I bought literally at the peak at 2819 earlier this month.

Awesome article! How soon do you think we are looking at realizing the s curve after the last big bull run?
