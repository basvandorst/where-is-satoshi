I think I'm going to need an 'ELI5' for this haha.

Cheers dude.

This is an awesome answer, the MP3 comparison makes a lot of sense. Thanks for taking the time to write such a detailed reply. I hope others get to see it, as it answers a lot of questions.
I was a little nervous about posting at first, but nobody has looked down on me for being a beginner in all of this. Instead people have taken their time to help explain. Let's hope once I have a firmer grasp I'll be able to do the same. What an awesome sub/community we've got going on here.

This is perfect. I couldn't have asked for a more comprehensive and explanatory post.
Thank you so much for taking the time to write all of this out. I'm sure that it has cleared up a lot of questions. Unless I've missed it and it's already there, a version of this should definitely be on the Bitreserve website.
When first stumbling across Bitreserve, I was inspired. I could tell this was going to be a game changer... But I wasn't sure why. You've cleared it all up for me and I feel more confident in using Bitreserve. Let's hope adoption becomes more widespread and our options for use expand. 
On a personal note, thank you for reading my backwardsly worded post and turning it into such a good answer.

Ok, I think I understand. So for example, I have 1BTC worth £200. I change it to GBP and keep it as £200. The BTC price then drops to £100. So I could change back to BTC and then have 2BTC. Hoping it will go back to the original price (£200) therefore giving me £400's worth? Is that the intended use? (*assuming what I just wrote made sense/wasn't too confusing*).
**Edit** 
Thanks for the explanation dude, appreciate it.

This is why I love Bitcoin, Reddit and the people of this Sub. What an awesome ending.

This is now what I'm thinking. I suppose other existing currencies are somewhat stable, so you could hold your Bitcoin in GBP etc, if the price drops to prevent loss? Hopefully someone can explain to me with examples. Thanks anyway bud.

I'm intrigued. Care to explain?

Ha, fair enough. Now I see the hilarity through a school kids eyes.

All I could find was a black and white dick. Is that it?

I wanted to avoid doing that. Ok, here it goes...
