Go to exchange and click OTCQB and OTCPK, most of these are Canadian companies but are traded on American exchanges with different tickers. I am sure there is a way to trade the canadian securities themselves but those might come with high fees.
Doing it OTC might be as easy as opening an investment account and placing your order. Talk to your bank, many Americans are doing this.
Also, check out a lot of discussions happen there. However, like any subreddit, there are pumpers, trolls and fear mongerers.

I don't get what you mean by that? I meant blue chip investments. Pretty self explanatory haha.

Maybe in the US. Trump has no say of what dispensaries can or can't do in Canada. If I'm being selfish, it's better for USA to suppress the emerging cannabis industry, this gives Canadians the chance to really start an industry they could be proud of.
Germans have cars
Swiss have banks
Italians have fashion
Americans have capital
Chinese have manufacturing
Canadians will have cannabis

Not sure if you're an American. But if you set up a brokerage account with your bank, you can speak to them about it.

Haha, you could buy a MJ stock and the next minute it could drop 10% in value. literally...
Most MJ stocks are now 30-40% below their All time high
Not saying they don't have a chance to rebound, but its a slow painful process as the sector becomes more mature. 
Still A LOT of potential in it and I recommend interested people to do their DD and invest accordingly!
My recommendations are Canopy Growth Corp (TSX: WEED) and Aphria Inc. (TSX: APH) both are the biggest in this space.
Not pumping, i promise just informing!

Oh yeah there are two on my street. These dispensaries are technically illegal but its too much of a process going through and shutting them down. They'll be shut down and replaced by government-run dispensaries. Similar to the way we sell our liquor. This is at least in Ontario, other provinces have different laws.
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:18:47
Right! I should mention American tickers as well! Thanks!
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:31:48
Someone help me out, I am not a BTC holder but a spectator. I get the sense this community is losing hope and believes BTC won't rebound. But we have literally seen time and time again BTC dropping then rallying absolutely crazy.
What has changed since then?

Does Cannabis end with recreational marijuana? 
People are COMPLETELY forgetting how big cannabis was before it was criminalized. Not speaking as a hippie, but cannabis has the potential to replace opioids when it comes to pain management. Marijuana goes from smoking a spliff with your friends to helping a woman with menstrual cramps, to helping a cancer patient deal with nausea and loss of appetite. Then there are SO many different ways to consume it as well. Smoking, vaping, oils, edibles,
But wait, what about its other uses besides medicinal and recreations? Industrial hemp. Hemp can be to create fibres, food, construction(check hempcrete), fuel, pet food. All of this has low THC and is not intended to get you high. 
HempCo Canada (HEMP) a Canadian publicly traded company that makes Hemp foodstuff, their [protein powder]( per 100 grams contains roughly 50 grams of protein, a boneless skinless chicken breast contains  [100 grams](
TL;DR So with cannabis you get clothing, housing, food, medicine and also be use recreationally. There is no way this industry is going to be a behemouth in the next 5 years, it will take time for it to grow. But the number of countries lifting restrictions on it is definitely a positive sign and shows there is good opportunity in this industry.

Which stocks, specifically?
But in any case I don't think it will until USA legalizes cannabis themselves.

I don't think these guys with their 2k-3k purchases have any impact on the price. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:21:06
It varies by province. Federally it will be treated like alcohol, i.e. taxes and distribution.
But for sale, it will be treated on a provincial level. In Ontario we have an LCBO(Liquor Control Board of Ontario) and Beer Store that have exclusive rights to sell beer, wine and liquor. They are owned by the government of Ontario. So basically you can't get beer or wine at a convenience store. HOWEVER, alcohol laws are starting to loosen so you can purchase only beer in some grocery stores around Ontario.
Marijuana will be treated similarly as well. It will be regulated and sold by the government of Ontario. However, there are of course private companies supplying to the dispensaries. You can also order online. Hopefully this changes and small businesses are able to open up shop.
It differs in provinces. For example, in Quebec, you CAN buy beer and wine at a convenience store.

I wonder the same thing over at , there are people over there who for no reason and have NO positions in these stocks say what a big mistake it is and how it is doomed to fail. Like I don't get it, its one thing to spread relevant information as to why they feel this way but they don't. These guys just fear monger because they missed out so are just pissy. It sucks. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:21:31
Lool. Go to any Canadian bank stock and you can literally see the incremental growth and consistent dividend payments. I'm not shorting these stocks. I'm planning to hold them long term and pretty much add to them as often as I can.
You have to have blue chip stocks and Canadian banks are blue chips. 
Will this change in the future? Absolutely. That what's crypto is doing... Shaking up the modern banking system. But if anyone believes we will adopt crypto ENTIRELY in our lifetime is wrong. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:50:50
In the long run, yes. Even BTC. 
Short term? Absolutely not.
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:02:03
You think BTC is likely to continue declining? 
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:02:06
And then another $1300 after that!
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:06:50
That's like saying that all that big money was chasing was companies that had no product but a website during the dot com boom. 
Once this industry starts getting exposure, it will be very clear what the benefits are.

You're acting like banks are going to go away tomorrow. Banks will still be active in our lifetime and I'm 24. Canadian banks usually weather bad economies pretty well which is why they're going to be around longer.

A blue chip stock is basically one that is established and financially sound. Usually pretty safe investments that grow YoY. Some pay dividends. 
DJIA tracks many blue chip stocks. That's why when it goes down, it reflects significantly at investor sentiment and confidence. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:32:29
I meant be more heavy on safe stocks. I have etfs that follow S&amp;P/TSX and major canadian banks. But i'm 75% volatile stocks
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:21:34
It was weed stocks and cryptos that made me want to wake up early, read the news and understand how micro and macro factors play into a stock price.
Volatility also thought me how to prevent FOMO and to not think I can ALWAYS time the market. I would like to throw money into safer investments such as banks and and shit like that.
But that's no fun. Maybe in the future. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:54:39
Regarding your reply to me about new buyers. Does the market care about new buyers? Or does it care about new money. Whether a BTC holder or a non holder buys $100 worth of BTC, does it really matter from who the money came from?
But I guess you also need an adequate number of new buyers and sellers. So I do get where you're coming from. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:22:16
These companies DO sell weed lol
@_date: 2018-02-18 16:54:01
Yeah, its called fluctuation. For something as volatile as btc, it has the tendency to go up and down. Not only go up or remain flat.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:57:39
Dude, yesterday it was at around 7000, right now its at around 8200,
Small fluctuations of a couple hundred backs are so common. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:54:03
I mean technically its still illegal in Canada. These companies have literally just been harvesting and prepping weed (this takes cycle so their building inventory). One of the main reasons why revenue is so small. Who tf can they sell too.
Interesting industry to say the least. Don't think I've been involved in something that has gone from illegal and transition into legal while also being traded on an exchange.
@_date: 2018-04-01 18:25:51
Hope so!
@_date: 2018-04-01 16:46:57
So HONESTLY wondering, wtf is going on to BTC, are we pretty much going to decline to non-existence?
