You probably want it as well polished as possible with 0 bugs, which eventually contributes to the value of Bitcoin protocol and infrastructure.
So I don’t care if it takes the devs 10 years to get it out, as long as they doing it the right way.

If anyone adopts it even right now, they will still be an early adopter in 10 years. We’re talking about the ability to stream currency in near future and that has huge implications.

No exchange or online wallet is consider "safe" in an event of a HF. Reason for that is very simple.. YOU DON'T HOLD THE PRIVATE KEYS. 
and that means you don't actually own the coins and have no control. 
Consider an offline wallet, hardware wallet or even paper wallet. As long as you have your own private keys you should be fine.

I'm not black but that's racist as fuck.

It's very simple. If you don't hold the private keys, u don't own the coins.

Check out this post from few days ago. 
I would have get those precious coins to a hardware or cold wallet as soon as possible, if I were you.

You can use anonymous Bitcoin ATMs, there is an app called CoinATMRadar which shows you the ATMs on a map. There are tons of em if you live in US or Europe.
All you need is your Bitcoin Address in form of a QR Code. 
Easy steps as well, just scan ur QR, put the cash in an wallah!

Well in that case use use bitsquare. it's decentralized and there is lots of different payment methods that sellers are willing to take. 
@_date: 2016-11-06 11:55:59
It requires ur bank account information if you want to sell Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2016-11-06 11:54:30
Also on Localbitcoins.com there are people that willing to trade in person in cash.

Same story as last year.
They try to ruin it with some fork, community won't adopt, prize will plunge (which is a good time to buy. Remember it was £150?), we come back right at where we are (takes a year or so) and hopefully this time price will break the $1000/BTC.

You can call me a lunatic or stupid but, the way I see it is [like any other situation in life] us people need to practice about getting together, and unite against the solo roller evil. Bitcoin is just a catalyst. More like a platform for this practice. 
Thanks to the devil also, for whom his presence is necessary for this scenario to play out.

Should we report it to mods or something?
@_date: 2017-04-02 16:29:04
It's a decentralized system. No one should have power over others. They will give in eventually.

I feel you. I hate those memes. All of them. And their goofy ass childish posters who think saying HODL HODL have the slightest impact on the market and the big forces and players behind it.

Mainly because mainstream media, as you might know, is not a reliable place to go in order to get the updates and news about crypto. 
That leaves us with community based sources like Reddit and BitcoinTalk forums etc.
As long as a major part of the community treats Bitcoin like a joke, rather than an invention which has the potential to revolutionize the way we live on this planet, we're going nowhere. 
It's like giving a time machine to bunch of toddlers and tell them to play with it. They probably end up painting on the walls and panels, instead of going back and sign Hitler up to some rehabilitation course when he was a teenage. 
I very much rather to see ideas, talks and discussions around integration of the technology even if it's in a non-technical way or average userish. 
Now days we have to scroll through tens of memes and possibly tens of "Hodl" (god I hate that word) posts to be able to read a useful post or discussion.
It's not healthy for us as a community.
I'm also subscribed to r/BitcoinMarkets which has a 'No Memes' rule and it's a very enjoyable and smooth experience. 
The only issue is that the majority of posts are about trading, price and exchanges with fewer posts about new technologies, news, start-ups etc.

I believe if you measure your wealth by the amount of Bitcoin you have rather than how much it worth against fiat you can come to a good conclusion.
The very fact that banksters are against Bitcoin, gives me reassurance that this is the way to go as a collective.

I use Coinsbank and I'm really happy with the service. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 08:09:31
As it had been said so many times before, If you don't hold the private keys, coins aren't yours.

What I read was that we want to centralize everything.

You wouldn't wanna say that if you could create money out of thin air and charge interest on top of it. 
Where do they get the money to pay the interest? Oh wait, we need to create more money for that. So on and so on...
