Thanks man. Was expecting some heat. Love BTC, honestly. But in order for it to even be a store of value (my initial investment hypothesis) it has to have decent fundamentals. Memepool, blocksizes and fees are a real turn off. I dunno, maybe I'm totally wrong and it blasts to 100K next year. But I doubt it. I think it will be hit by a real sobering up of the entire crypto space on one hand, and by better relative value of certain alts on the other.

I was once in the Solomon Islands, near Guadalcanal. And I was freebasing Ayahuasca with some locals, bunging jumping with vines off of 100ft handmade contraptions. At one point, I distinctly heard this old elder (who was probably 16 hours in to a 40 hour ayahuasca bender) yell "YITYOOOOOOOIN". And this was in 2011. So I'm pretty sure this means he was saying that he wrote the source code for Bitcoin and was Satoshi Nakamoto. Maybe nothing... just thought I'd share though.

It’s a Swedish etf called XBT Provider. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:47:29
Did you watch what he said? He says that bitcoin is different than gold because "gold has been around a long time" and "bitcoin has never withheld a recession". Those two statements alone are meaningless.
He also is factually incorrect when describing the role of miners. Oh and also, he has no idea how wholesale power markets work, or what load balancing means on a grid given his simplistic view that "more mining = more energy" as if power markets didn't have peak and off-peak load curves.

I know this isn't popular but I've liquidated my BTC in the last 3 weeks. HODL'd from May until now. But my view is I see the writing on the wall. Frankly the underlying technology isn't great, and the internal politics of the platform are a turnoff. Right now I hold no crypto but I will look to alts for the first time in 2018. BTC has been very good to me, but I also need to protect my investment.

You have no idea? Let me tell you then.
He's the former general counsel for Long Term Capital Management. This was a hedge fund in the late 90s that had supposedly "cracked the code" of trading. It imploded spectacularly. 
Since then he's been constantly predicting the dollar would collapse (has been do so for ten years) and peddles gold as an investment. Says it will go to $10,000. 
He then incorrectly describes what miners do in the bitcoin chain of custody, and then makes broad generalized statements about BTC energy use, with little to no understanding of how an electric grid works, what a load profile is, or what arbitrage in wholesale energy markets is. 
Hope this gives you a little more of an idea.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:13:23
I sold all my BTC in the last two weeks because I think BTC has run its short/medium terms bullrun and will correct downward along with the entire crypto asset class, before moving back up slowly, with most gains happening in ALTs.

@_date: 2017-12-09 13:05:48
This is an excellent comment, and I agree entirely. I am treating BTC as a speculative investment much more akin to gold than a currency. In fact my exposure to BTC is through an ETF, which tells you everything you need to know. 
While I do think blockchain technology is fascinating, and has the potential to usher in massive disruption across a number of industries, BTC is nowhere near having the scale, adoption and ease of doing such things. 
To you great point, because it's deflationary by nature, it encourages hoarding.

Precisely. His bit on ICOs is also insightful:
And there is a pervasive narrative out there that supports entrepreneurs looking to create new crypto assets. The idea is that by selling assets to users before your network launches, you create “evangelists” who will be early users and promoters you wouldn’t otherwise have if there were no financial incentive to participate in your community.
The problem with this line of thinking is that it conflates early investors with early users. The overlap between people who buy your crypto asset and people who actually want to use the service you are building is likely very, very small, especially during market manias like this one. It creates a false sense of “product-market fit.” Yes, people are buying your crypto asset. But that’s because the “market” are people who want to get rich and the “product” you are selling is a “way to get rich.”

You've described a plea baragain. You've provided no compelling argument about why that is "immoral". If you're innocent you should beat the charges.

Because they had about 7 counts to already nail him on including the so-called "super kingpin" law of "continuing a criminal enterprise". ORdering hits at that points was kiddy play.

I actually have a bitcoin back guarantee program. Once I receive the computer, I will give you the bitcoin IOUs this guarantees that whatever I find on your computer you will get, and not at all be taken and never been seen again.

It was a risk. Because no murder was proven. So maybe a jury would quibble over that.

I bought it via an Swedish ETF. Much easier and safer. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 02:56:24
The best thing to do would be to send me your computer, and I will get the bitcoin for you.

I don't think you understand how plea bargains work my man.
@_date: 2017-06-01 01:25:35
He was offered 10 years to life plea bargain. And I agree with everything you said. Read American Kingpin - it's great.
I was ambivalent about him. When I finished reading it I was comforted in the decision to put this dude behind bars.

Brutal m8. Sounds like you're getting utterly taken to the cleaners.

I'm in this for the long run! Best time to absolutely load up is now!!!! *giggles nervously*... *cry laughs as buy order is sent*
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:33:56
Hodlers do consider price. To hoard more and hodl. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:17:00
a to a strawman because i'm making sense? *rolls eyes* 
Yeah kids should totally have "personal responsibility". I mean, wtf, why can't they handle guns safely? and take responsibility for taking Schedule I drugs? I just. don't. get it. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 17:25:34
No because if there is a mistrial or hung jury on one count it fucks the whole prosecution up. They wanted to nail him without the risk of a mistrial.

It's going to $10,000 in a few minutes watch. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 01:27:09
lol "lead investigators". you have no idea what you're talking about. There was no "lead investigator", since about six or seven agencies were after him including the FBI, HSI, IRS and DEA. The two guys who stole bitcoins from one of DPR's lieutenants were total scrubs, and are now in prison. He was ultimately captured by the FBI.

Each vendor had user reviews, like Amazon. There was definitely a chance you could get some fucked up drugs. 
In fact there was a harrowing witness at Ulbricht's trial. She was the mother of a 16 year old who had taken some Chinese made hallucinogenic and ended up having a panic attack and jumping out a window. 
More importantly, anyone in defense of "self regulation" must also hate things like environmental regulation, gun laws, government sponsored health care, the Food and Drug Administration etc. It's a really bleak view of how society should work.
@_date: 2017-06-01 01:24:37
That's exactly how it works. I was a juror on a felony case, and I can tell you the evidence on his laptop of him ordering hits is by far enough to convict him.

I just finished reading American Kingpin. He was guy who built out his libertarian vision and ended up becoming enthralled with power, ordering killings, and taking absolutely no responsibility for the second order effects of his highly illegal enterprise.
Reading about the parents of teenagers who OD'd on Chinese heroin  will make you think twice about what Ulbricht did.
@_date: 2017-06-01 01:23:33
He didn't get "double life". He got life without the possibility of parole.
@_date: 2017-06-26 21:54:12
So they end up going absolutely mental and chopping up their colleagues with axes?
@_date: 2017-06-01 14:09:00


Oh the irony.

My brain hurt reading this.
