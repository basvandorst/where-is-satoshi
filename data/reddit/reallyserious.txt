Sucks for you. I mined my first 2 BTC myself on hardware I found in a dumpster with electricity paid by my employer. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:31:40
So... how do you get your money back? In another 4 days?
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:32:02
Seems like you need some kind of escrow service anyway. Or you would have to put trust in your fellow humans. That invites scammers. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 20:05:45
Selv tak. Hopefully some non-Scandinavians will find it interesting. We already know that it is. :)

Indeed. He's Swedish and "varg" is wolf in Swedish. I assume "warg" is an older spelling of varg. The W-letter is called double-v in Swedish, not double-u as in English. So many older spellings that earlier had w in them and is now spelled with v. In Norse mythology a warg is a mythological wolfe. E.g. the [Fenrir wolf aka Fenrir warg]( 
His other last name, Svartholm, translates to something like Black-islet. 
His first name, Gottfrid, is a very old name and is not common in Sweden for anyone younger than 100 years old. It doesn't translate as well or obvious but if I were to make an attempt it would be something like Good-peace.

How much has it cost you to mine that coin?
@_date: 2018-05-20 06:07:44
Yes. That's an old picture of Gottfrid Svartholm Warg.
@_date: 2014-03-22 16:19:13
You're right. It does however change the playing field for those with mining rigs significantly. When the block reward goes down to 0 and if the transaction fees don't cover your electricity bills you may end up with useless hardware.
@_date: 2014-03-26 07:17:22
I believe you have to sign your extra payload with a private key as well so as to prevent others from using your hashes in other transactions that is not yours. That could wreak some havoc on your system if not protected against. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 15:59:09
Jst FYI, if you didn't know. There's a new block added to the blockchain approximately once every 10 minutes. So that image, while better than downloading from scratch, will be slightly outdated pretty much immediately. You might want to keep updating it weekly or something. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 14:07:56
Are these badboys hardwired to do double sha so that they are incapable of calculating single sha?
@_date: 2018-05-20 20:26:56
Yes, you're right. My literal translation in today's Swedish isn't where the name originally comes from. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 00:00:15
A big part of the original bitcoin paper by Satoshi was the idea that the majority of the clients behave the same, and apply the same rules to the blockchain and transactions. This is important so as to be able to discard malicious transactions and behaviour. But if there are several versions floating around it's much more difficult to make sure that you are talking to a client with the right version and you risk fragmentation of the network.
@_date: 2014-03-22 14:11:30
Actually, the block reward goes down with time. Eventually it will reach 0. After that (probably long before) nobody will be mining for the block reward. After the block reward have reached 0 the only thing motivating mining is transaction fees.
@_date: 2014-07-17 18:13:25
Yes there is risk. You have to keep your staff trained in how to accept btc as payment without screwing up.
@_date: 2014-05-09 14:56:26
Please tell more, so that I can determine if to agree or reject your statement.
@_date: 2014-05-14 08:38:09
I'd like a discount as much as the next geek. But in reality they are taking a bigger risk by accepting bitcoin since the currency is so volatile. I've actually seen vendors charge 10% more when you pay with bitcoin to cover the risk. They also have costs converting the btc to SEK (Swedish Krona).
@_date: 2014-04-27 14:52:37
Dumping is just another word for spending a lot at the same time. If he is spending the coins they end up on the market and the total amount of btc in circulation increases. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 17:47:19
The network effect?
@_date: 2014-01-17 16:50:51
I have used Kapiton in the past. What should one use as a Swede now?
@_date: 2014-05-14 08:39:38
Did you pick it up at webhallen or somewhere else?
@_date: 2014-04-05 16:16:15
Cool. How much ram does that require to run ok? Are you using leveldb or perhaps some sql backend?
@_date: 2014-02-05 14:43:55
How are the Chinese different from the rest of the world in this regard?
@_date: 2014-05-25 22:30:43
Yeah, until they reconnect and broadcast their version of the chain which is longer than everyone else's due to superior hashing power.
@_date: 2014-05-25 22:37:02
That's different. Stealing someone else's money without any significant investment on your own part is profitable even if the price plummets.

It's his fault if he didn't have a backup at a physically different location. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 15:14:58
What did you do? Disabled the verifying code?
@_date: 2014-03-25 14:41:30
Yes, exactly. I don't see where the problem is with this suggestion. If they want to assign additional data to a transaction those 40 bytes are plenty in order to point to a unique key in another system that holds the information. I don't see why **everyone** that runs a full node of the blockchain needs to store **their** application specific data. 
@_date: 2014-07-15 08:31:29
With the mining difficult rising, older hardware are not efficient enough to be profitable any more.
@_date: 2014-05-05 15:52:22
Why do you reboot?
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:58:30
I don't even know what Counterparty offers, but if they offer something to their customers I assume they also take responsibility for what they offer. Perhaps I misunderstood your question? 
@_date: 2014-07-25 13:17:15
No, everyone holding bitcoins do not pay a fee every 10 minutes. You pay a transaction fee at most once per transaction. If you don't move your btc it doesn't cost you anything.
@_date: 2015-05-10 07:17:43
I'm not sure if those miners can do it but as a general principle it's certainly possible to e.g make a sha256 rainbow table for all inputs of say 10 character passwords. No need for a miner though.

Satoshi Nakamoton't.

Never thought about it that way.
@_date: 2015-04-19 05:50:35
Brand is looking for publicity for his book. He is utterly irrelevant in making the world a better place.
@_date: 2015-09-26 21:11:30
Since the price fluctuates a lot more than the dollar they may lose money from the customer bought to when they exchange it to dollars. They may also make profit from the fluctuations but it is certainly a bigger risk when handling a currency that isn't stable. Bigger risk has always meant bigger price. Nowhere near 60% though. 
@_date: 2015-04-24 12:09:49
That wouldn't work. If everybody pruned their blockchain there would be nobody around to give you the whole.
@_date: 2017-05-21 21:00:13
Isn't the value of all currency built on speculation of things that hasn't happened yet? I.e. the assumption that a peace of paper with no intrinsic value can be traded for goods and food in the future. If I believe that, and everybody around me also believe that, it works. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 12:56:21
No. He's saying it was a lot easier back then. Not harder. Downhill both ways would be a better analogy.
@_date: 2017-07-30 09:47:02
Oh. Thanks for the heads up. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 16:06:27
Yes, this is correct. But it requires technical know how to do and it's easy to get it wrong. That's a deal breaker for many. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 08:00:26
Either you pay for the escrow service or you pay directly to the seller. Either way you're trusting criminals with your money. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 09:47:19
Brb, protecting seed better...
