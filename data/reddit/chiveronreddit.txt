“Taking a long position” just means you buy the asset, it has nothing to do with duration of time

My FOMO buy at 10.5k then the proceeding 9.5k attempt-to-catch-a-falling-knife buys are looking pretty sweet right now.

This has been bugging me as a lot of people around here keep talking like the "bull run" last year was from November - December which was really when prices went parabolic. The bull run didn't just happen in a matter of weeks, it happened over the entire course of 2017 and most of 2016, leading to the parabolic gains in November - December. 
Now they think we're somehow going parabolic in the last few months of this year, after almost the entire year of bear market. There's no way. We may be in a bull market now, but I would expect a slow build up all of 2019 and into 2020 before we get the run that people are looking for. 
By this time last year we were already making ATH's on a regular basis. We've got a long way to go...
@_date: 2018-10-15 20:15:09
Agreed. That is why I don't expect to hit 20k again until maybe late next year.

Been waiting for this! Thank you

Please stop using the term "going long" like you're a wide receiver. In investing, holding a "long position" just means you own the underlying asset, as opposed holding a "short position" where you agree to sell an asset that you currently don't own. It has nothing to do with the duration of time you plan to hold it.

If you send straight from Coinbase you will pay a fee. If you send from Coinbase to GDAX to your Trezor there won't be a fee. GDAX is owned by Coinbase so if you have an account, you can use both. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:17:47
You do not have to leave it plugged in, and yes it updates with the market. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:44:46
Yeah, on GDAX, hit "deposit". You will then have to option to deposit from your Coinbase account, no address input necessary. Once you do that, and your coins show up in your GDAX account you hit "withdraw". This is where you put in your Trezor address and type in the amount of BTC you want to send. Make sure that your address matches up exactly. Most of the time it happens in an instant, but it looks like transactions on GDAX are currently delayed, so give it a bit and they will show up in your Trezor.

It will show up in your transactions on Coinbase

I'm confused...In order for Bitcoin to really take off it needs to become adopted by the masses, but once people start talking about it as an investment then the bubble is about to pop?  So which is it? You want this great little investment secret that normal people don't know about, then how is it ever going to be adopted by the masses? 
And I get it...Mass adoption means people are *using* Bitcoin, not just buying it as a speculative investment. Why then is this subreddit celebrating news that more people are googling "how to buy Bitcoin" than "how to buy gold"?. Why is everyone happy that Coinbase is trending in the app store and Bitcoin futures are hitting the market? These are all investment indicators, not adoption indicators.

Commenting so I can come back and read the responses. if anyone has comments about the Trezor as well, please advise 
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:25:55
What you should do instead is sell that testicle and buy more bitcoin!

I won't lie, I was asleep during this last dip. I think the bottom happened around midnight Saturday? I woke up the next day and saw it hovering around $6,000 - $6,3000. Bought more than my normal weekly purchase at $6,500 and I'm pretty happy about that. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:31:48
Transfer the coins to GDAX then to your Trezor. Check the address before hitting send to make sure they match exactly

So the guys that went to war with Bitcoin (Core) are now going to war with each other? Can you ELI5 what is going on? 
I've always stayed far away from BCH and this just wreaks of more shit

Picture this: You've got one of the largest generations in American history wanting so desperately to retire, but many can't because they are still recovering from the 2008 recession. They are relying heavily on their 401k's to provide for their golden years and soon you will have BAKKT, which by offering Bitcoin could give their portfolios one last substantial gain before they reach retirement age. Traditional markets begin to slow down after a 10 year bull cycle, cue massive amounts of boomer FOMO money coming back into the crypto market over the next year and a half and paving way for the most ridiculous bull run in BTC history. Institutional money has been accumulating at a discount all of 2018. After it breaches ATH again the amount of FOMO money coming in will make all of our heads spin. Around 60k we will hit $1T market cap and just keep going from there. People are converting their entire 401k to BTC, all timed nicely with the 2020 halving. The halving is not going to be the *cause* of the next parabolic run, but the spring is being loaded and could be let go right around that time. Predicting the bull market to start here soon but it won't be what you think. 2019 will be steady increase of 2 steps forward, one and a half steps back. We will have at least a year of steady growth before this thing takes off again like it did at the end of 2017...remember 2017's parabolic rise came from a slow steady bull market starting back in 2015.

those who provide value, a great product or honest service has nothing to do at all with "nice guys finishing last".
You don't have to be nice to do any of that

Yeah ya'll say that now but every crypto sub lost their minds when that Hodor commercial came out like a month ago

So do I get B2X if my coins are in my hardware wallet at the time of the fork? 
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:11:23
Great thank you for the info! ����
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:30:41
Do you realize to "being long" on a position just means you own it, and has nothing to do with how much time you keep it? 
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:11:10
Great thank you for the info! ����
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:57:10
Are you keeping them in your wallet for the November fork, or do you have to move them to an exchange like coinbase to get the B2X coins?
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:51:31
I've got my coins in a hardware wallet. Do I need to get them back in Coinbase before the fork to benefit from it?
