The only people who want Bitcoin to crash are bulls pretending to be bears.

Not that I know of. If you're worried about it buy some ether with a credit/debit and use that. Otherwise pay the premium on the bitcoin to lock in the price

All you $;" bulls need to back off. Just let it happen, let it fall. Errbody keeps jumping the gun.
Bitcoin may not reign supreme forever but if it crashes, it's going to make a lot of people a lot of money on the way down during bear season, and on the way back up when the running of the bulls begins.
We all make the most money if we buy at the same time. There are a lot of powerful people pushing it down, let them push it down, wait for the running of the bulls and stop jumping the gun. If you HAVE to buy go buy some ripple and let the bulls sleep awhile longer.

I'm sure you'll figure it out.

So btc will go down and I can buy more. 
That and it's cheap and semi stable (semi-less likely to die more like it)

You're still hung up on this? I do this for a living and as a hobby because it's fun for me so I apologize my finance puns rubbed you the wrong way. Clearly you have a bone to pick with "finance kiddies" which is funny considering it was a "finance kiddie" who turned me on to crypto currency 3 years ago. It was a "finance kiddie" that got me to invest first in bitcoin, ether and now ripple. Instead of arguing with everybody you can find on reddit maybe you should take what I said to heart and watch the charts. If you have the capital these volatile prices are a great way to make money but I'm not here to teach you.
Apologies in advance for the block, but I have better things to do than argue with someone that clearly has a stick stuck somewhere. You should work on that.
investopedia... lol

Don't ever buy  btc straight off coinbase. Get it from gdax. If you need it right now, buy ether or fiat off coinbase transfer to gdax ( you have an account with gdax if you have one with coinbase ) and buy it from gdax
