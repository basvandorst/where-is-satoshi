I only read a couple.of articles about lightning and lost interest. i could see a potential use case for eg oil countries exchanging contracts but there are already coins that excel in that space. The 5B unbanked that Andreas used to talk about as the real target for Bitcoin will remain unbanked by lightning.

There is no bank in the US that has made any profit in the last 10 years. Banks like chase Morgan have derivatives debts equivalent to twice the world's GDP. They can never begin to  pay that back. They're zombie corporations kept alive by printed money which tax payers are liable for. They have turned the world's economy into a house of cards. Aside from that they are great.

When it was released to the world back in 2009 and up through 2014 it was revolutionary. The concept of just sending "money" between two people anywhere in the world  and in just a few minutes with very low fees was amazing. But the banking industry didn't stand still either. For me the ultimate in using money with optimum convenience right now is the Wechat wallet in China. Almost no one uses cards or cash in China now. Some of the alts are hoping to emulate that as we speak. Decentralization and anonymity were big drivers but for the average person that's not a huge deal most of the time.

How do I respond to that? Lightning does nothing that a block size increase wouldn't do and a block size increase will cut fees by 90% and only rich people can pay them now. Poor people get fucked just like before BTC. Centralization isn't and never will be an issue. Tell me a country that doesn't mine Bitcoin? The core devs will fight a block size increase tooth and nail because segwit and lighting will be irrelevant.

Since the 1970s there's been no difference between the actions democrats and republicans. It's only the words they use that change. Both parties are controlled by the banks who are in turn controlled by the Fed. On the one hand, blockchain could be used to validate the voting process but take it a step further and you've just made the two party concept obsolete. Switzerland essentially has a decentralized voting system and that is the last thing that any republican or democrat wants to see in the US. When Trump threatened to drain the swamp, it obviously got a lot of people on both sides of the fence worried and you had major republicans publicly rooting for Hillary.

If the whole crypto space goes down it could even be time to buy gold for a few months. I'm not very bullish on real estate right now but a mortgage is real, tangible debt. When I was young the stocks at my company doubled in price and I sold all and paid off my mortgage. The stocks kept going up in price and doubled again but it just felt so good to be debt free I didn't have any serious regrets.

The big short is a fantastic and important movie but the taxpayers (of this generation) didn't bail anyone out. The fed printed $29T in the first three months just to keep the top banks alive. Tax receipts only total 2.6T per annum which is augmented by printing dollars. The banks are still zombies and require multi billion dollar donations every day. Future generations will foot that bill. Up until three years ago Bitcoin was seen as a solution. Now it's been co-opted by the dark side, there will be a battle but this time I think good will win out. Eventually. The hassle is that 95% of humans aren't very good contrarian thinkers and can't separate religious fervor from simple factual data. It's time to remove the dev team and mods and replace them with 1) competent and 2) non-corrupt developers. They don't have the moral capacity to do it themselves.

Yes, whenever people ask me why my marriage broke up ago, I tell them after many years, somehow the passion was gone. The first day I read about bitcoin I was hooked and got hold of some coins within a day or two. I knew a bit about crypto and a lot about currencies. It was one of the most exciting periods in the last 20 years for me. I wouldn't even care if no one used it as a currency. It was just so damn clever. 
The last two years something went bad and that passion evaporated but I stuck around to see if things got better. I don't think it was incompetence but more about collusion. The former I'm ok with. I do many dumb things myself. The latter I have a real issue with. Steam were perfectly correct to do what they did. I'll eagerly await the apologies from the devs and mods. Right.

This year the bankers took over btc via the core devs. Do I give a fuck? No. I'm a math dude, not religious, so to me it's simple from a tech perspective. Lightning sucks any way you look at it and increasing block size solves 90% of any scaling problems for the next 18 months. I used to be passionate about btc but I'm never passionate about politics and so I'll take my money and move on. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:02:05
And yet Andreas and the core devs proactively assisted the CME/CBOE in fast-tracking their futures products even though they - more than anyone -- knew that the network was crippled due to the deficient block size. It's called collusion and sabotage. Someone should tell Andreas to give his coins back. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:51:30
If Andreas and presumably other dev type people are working in an advisory capacity to the CME and CBOE then any rational person would have told those groups that the Bitcoin network is awaiting an upgrade and in no way can handle the extra capacity that futures activity will introduce. Instead they deliberately allowed a crippled network to be subject to a possibly extraordinary increase in transactions. If you don't see anything wrong with that picture then I cant help you. To me it stinks of something bad.

Absolutely not. Each president (although I haven't heard trump say it yet) says that a strong dollar is good for the economy but their actions are the polar opposite. They accuse the chinese of manipulating their currency but the US and Japan are by far the worst offenders. The US banks were all nationalized in 2008 and none would survive more than a week without a daily handout from the fed. 
In terms of gold and purchasing power, the USD has lost 97% of its value since the creation of the fed. But most of that loss occurred since they went off the gold standard. According to USNews the long term unemployed in america is over 94M. That means that tax payers have to support a population equivalent to the 12th largest country in the world (vietnam, philippines?).


The petrodollar replaced the gold standard. The debts had become too large and a dollar pegged to gold couldn't be printed out of thin air. Without the petrodollar the US can't print dolllars and hyperinflation sets in. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:39:22


The US demanded the petrodollar standard. They agreed to provide military support for saudi arabia if SA forced the OPEC countries to continue to price oil in USD. Any country that has since tried to trade oil in gold or another currency (Iraq, Libya come to mind) is soon shown the error of their ways. I've always felt it was strange that on 9-11 all but one of the terrorists was from saudi but the US went on to invade Iraq.

All of the points you're making sound like they come from an economics class, not the real world. China and Russia are actively trading oil and nat gas between each other in their own currencies. The reason Syria has had the shit bombed out of it (and why Putin moved into the crimean space) is because Russia wants to run nat gas and possibly oil through syria directly to europe. Thus the aggressive expansion of nato and the infamous "Fuck the EU" from Victoria Nuland. China is rebuilding the silk road because the US economy is dead without printing USD. The US can't even pay the interest on its loans with current tax revenues. GDP includes government spending which is the only reason the economy appears to be expanding. 36% government spending is the sign of a banana republic. Without reserve status and the ability to print $s, the US would be another venezuela. 


Yes, the USD is the reserve currency of the world. Oil is also traded in GBP but its heyday has long gone. 


This is totally incorrect. If the US loses petrodollar status, it's dead in the water. 


See above. 


The US exports inflation to other countries and the only reason it can do this is because of the petrodollar. 


I could give a fuck about investing in the blockchain but I do trade coins like any other currency. The dollar is effectively dead in the water but it will need a few years and a couple of world wars for them to give up reserve status and the PD.

Longer term investors try to be dispassionate about when to take profits and losses but it never gets easier. If you buy at 13k and think it's peaked at 15k and get out and it carries on up to 17k, so what. If your eventual target is 100k then getting back in at 17k is still fine.

The US$ used to be backed by gold. Now it's backed by "the full faith of the US government." If anything were to happen to the USD (eg a competitor to the dollar) that undermines people's faith in the government's ability to pay back its debt, it could lead to inflation which would place the government itself at risk. 
The interesting part will be if any country decides to shift from its own currency to a cryptocurrency like bitcoin.

The gold standard made it very difficult to conduct expensive wars because no one could fund them. So they took the dollar off the gold standard and started expanding the money supply. Typically if you print 10% more dollars then your currency would drop in absolute value and oil would cost ~10% more. But by controlling SA and hence opec they can contain the price of oil and they can contain the price of gold using futures markets. But the inflation shows up in other countries and they have to lower interest rates artificially to hold their currencies back. Which makes inflation worse. For every ounce of gold and silver there are more than 300 paper promises on that single ounce and every week more are printed to maintain the veneer of low inflation. Some french economist back in the 70s told Nixon that the dollar was getting out of hand and Nixon's advisor told him yes but it's your problem.

Lightning, if it does ever arrive will be a major disappointment. If you're a fan of Bitcoin then it's time to act. Way past time.  The core devs are either criminals, corrupt or incompetent or all three and whichever it is they shouldn't even be in charge of a cash register, let alone the most prominent new currency in modern times. I'm hoping they either leave quietly or just commit suicide. Either is an acceptable solution. Andreas needs to give his coins back if he hasn't already converted then to xrp.

Not sure if you're being serious but no competent developer is going to copy segwit or lightning because they're shit half ass solutions to non existent problems. Increase the block size and Bitcoin cash will disappear and Bitcoin will be king again. But your Gods don't want that

Thus the old line: How do you put an MBA grad in charge of his own small company? Put him in charge of a big company and wait a while.

"Regulated" is a bit of a strong term. It really only applies in practice to really small players who don't get bailed when they fuck up. No major bank execs went to jail after 2008. Plus in this case the regulators aren't going to listen to the consumers' complaints with much interest

Either you're a total retard or a troll. Seriously please tell me because from a scientific perspective I'd be interested. The core devs are destroying g Bitcoin.  If you can help me increase the block size then let's work together because it's the only thing that will save BTC. I don't want to argue with a bot or an irrelevant well meaning loser.

Fiat is just the name given to any currency which is backed by nothing except a government promise. Basically every country's currency right now. Before 1971 the USD was backed by gold.

The security setup sounds fine. I would be tempted to sell at least 90%, keep the cash parked in an exchange ready to buy back in and wait out the next couple of weeks. If Wall street wins with futures, BTC could be into another great stagnation period and if that happens again it will be a long wait.

The people who live in those parts of the world also survive on a few dollars a day. I think they might balk at paying a transaction fee which represents a week's earnings. They are being alienated from a system that was arguably created to help them.

Haha he did call her some unmentionable names. The silly thing was that at the time $2k wasn't a big deal for them even if it had gone to zero. I suspect her family members were telling her to sell and she listened. And I finally followed my own advice and sold half of my holdings at $2450. No regrets there. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:28:17
I persuaded my brother to invest $2k at $40 per btc. They went up to $80 per coin and his wife nagged and nagged at him to sell. Even when I said to take the profits off the table and sell half, she wouldn't give up until he sold them all so she could buy a new lounge suite. I gave my niece a bitcoin for her engagement party this year at just under $1k. So far she hasn't sold. The bottom line is it's always sensible to take a profit but sometimes it's also wise to hang in there and pray. This is likely a once in a lifetime opportunity.

Seriously? Do you think that either the original poster's comment or my response was aimed at US-based bitcoiners? Or do you think that perhaps, just maybe, we were talking about what Andreas used to refer to as the "6B unbanked people of the world that bitcoin would open up the world for"?

This was my first ever email about bitcoin back in March 2013. I'd stopped reading all financial news for more than a year and for some reason decided to get back into it. I sent this email to my brother and a few friends.
"This looks really interesting. Why haven't I heard of bitcoin before? If you also haven't heard about it watch the video. The guy talks about how it went up in value from 27 cents or so in 2010 to $2 by 2011. If I'm correct, today it is $32. I don't know anything about it at the moment but something tells me it's worth keeping tabs on." *Everyone said I'd be crazy to invest. 
This was the tongue in cheek reply my brother sent yesterday when I reminded him of that original email. 
"And how stupid do you look now?
Wouldn't listen to me though.....

I've been having these same thoughts all day.

I had a card from tenx but then they had to cancel it due to provider issues. But I think it's a very useful setup especially if you're traveling and I'm ordering a replacement card. But my recent experience with wechat wallet (like apple/google pay on steroids) in china makes me think that credit and debit cards, not to mention cash itself, are history. After I'd loaded wechat up and linked it to a bank account I never pulled my wallet out for the next ten days. So damn useful. In the meantime, tenx is well worth considering.

When I was young I sold some shares that had doubled and paid off my mortgage. At 25 years old. The stock doubled over the next few months but that's life. But what I found was that I needed that debt to keep my drive going. OP absolutely did the right thing but he/she will be back I'm sure. Enjoy a few months of being debt free and then re-evaluate.

These supposed finance tv programs are run by wall street to sell stocks. They serve no other purpose. "No, people aren't buying bitcoins. They're investing in tech companies' shares that provide services..." Sigh.

I was trying to explain bitcoin to a friend once and when I said supply was capped at 21M but I had no real idea why, he said, probably just because it's money for the 21st century.

This is by far the most sensible suggestion.

Also worth noting that the "$10,000" figure is the only financial amount that the fed/treasury hasn't adjusted for inflation in decades since the law was passed. It would almost make me suspicious....
