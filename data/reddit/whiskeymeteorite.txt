At least you got a warning...They just up and closed my account.  I had to dig and dig just for a reason.

As much as I like TD accepting Bitcoin...they are pretty terrible at it.
I ordered something from them and apparently my order never went through. 
* I received the confirmation of order, I paid in BTC; but never received an email that payment went through (that would make sense).
* Order never became available to look at on TD
* Contacted CS later that day to check on order; they said to wait a few hours
* Waited, then contacted them again after not hearing anything; they said I would hear something within 24-48 hours.  They took my TrxID and wallet address
* 5 days after purchase, I still havent heard a word.  I contact them again and tell me to wait 24-48 hours again.
* I say "Hell No," I want to speak to someone now.  
* Moments later, they tell me my order never went through and the issues was resolved.
* I tell them the issue wasnt resolved, I never received anything from them besides an order CONFIRMATION.  
* After some talk, they sent me an email to get a refund from bitpay...except the link was broken ("
* Had them resend the email and I went through the refund process
Overall, their CS is horrible and don't even notify you of important order information unless you contact them and fight for it.  I've been a TD customer for a decade...I may never use them again.

I didn't do anything...I'm just posting the news.
However, I remember seeing the Limit one per customer when it first came out...
@_date: 2014-03-25 02:31:40
haha, yea. I mean, if you pay with v.me...you can't even view your order like normal.

I only listed theoreticals.  I'm sure that 10^-5 will increase as the technology ages.  Dear god.
Why don't you give all your data in ENIAC speeds?  No one imagined we would be in the gigahertz in the 50's.

Hey man, it is not their fault.
@_date: 2014-05-08 14:37:58
Considering you didn't read the paper, I'd argue you have no idea what you are talking about. 
The figures mentioned above are theoretical  and results will vary depending on the quantum computer in the future.  I don't see that as a flaw in my comment above considering quantum computers are in the young development.  There is still a lot of controversy whether we have created the first quantum computer.
But feel free to express yourself as smarter than myself and all of the scientific papers out there on this subject.

If you have access to a university, look up the scientific paper "Quantum computing and communications – Introduction and challenges" by Sandor Imre.
It talks about Shor and crypography.  You can read Shor's abstract [here](
@_date: 2014-05-08 18:33:08
alright, we are done here.  You are no longer even addressing what we have talked about.
Just be a man and admit you were wrong and leave peacefully.
All future responses will be ignored.

The problem is, you are comparing it to buying goods.  Coinbase is a currency/stock exchange.  The process takes a long time because you are doing a bank transfer.  You must compare this to other similar services such as a stock broker...where you exchange US currency for Stock.  The same ach process takes days to complete to transfer USD into your account.
Buying goods such as digital items are done using credit cards (even debit cards online are ran as credit), and result in a 2-3% fee for the merchant.  Are you willing to pay 2-3% more for an instant exchange?  The exchange doesn't want to on large amounts or small amounts.  
Instead, they have you link a bank account and credit card for instant transactions.  You initiate a buy of $1000 in BTC and they begin the ACH transfer to the bank.  If at some point they find your account fraudulent, lacking in funds, etc...they have a fallback on your credit card.  They may lose a few percent, but better than losing a thousand smackeroos.
Get your mind out of the gutter and make some fair comparisons if you want your argument to be taken seriously.
I have to fill out a paper ACH form and fax it every time I want to move funds to and from my ONLINE stock broker account and don't offer instant transactions with credit card.  So yes, coinbase is quite easy compared to similar services.

He speaks for everyone and not just himself and his businesses. This will create unnecessary hassle for anyone who deals in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-08 16:19:41
Your problem is that you are thinking about today's half-assed quantum computers that are still in development and not the future.
I never stated the numbers were current.  As stated, we may not have a true quantum computer as of today.
Your argument is irrelevant.
@_date: 2014-04-09 03:30:00
I'd gladly sell on there...but how can I be sure you are legit?  What is keeping you from taking my BTC and running?
@_date: 2014-05-08 18:23:07
Even with a 1mhz clock, a quantum computer could crack a 1024 bit number in a day.
Considering there is no general-purpose quantum computer in existence (and the d-wave hasnt published any clock speeds), I'm not sure what else we have to calculate on besides theoreticals.  But, if you have sources claiming clock speeds...by all means, show me.
[1Mhz is a practical speed as of today](

Or I'm a Computer Engineer currently taking a class on future computing architectures and reviewed scientific papers dealing with quantum computing and cryptography.
Most of my source information is behind a paywall; a simple [google search]( can yield high level information on the subject.

You may think that...but [Forbes]( is...and it picked up the story and cited Business Insider.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:57:47
You can be passionate, but be responsible.  
It has been clear that r/bitcoin is on top of the news the moment it happens.  The major news sources obviously skim this subreddit for news regarding its state.  That has huge implications on bitcoin as a whole.
The articles about insolvency were edited within 20 min but both versions exist on here still.  Do you really think mass media will post the story about the article that doesnt mention insolvency?  It reaches a lot more bitcoin users faster, and the price and publicity will ultimately suffer.
Edit: and then other mass media will pick the story from businessinsider and it will spread 10-fold.  And who knows the truth?
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:24:28
A quantum computer could theoretically crack a 10,000 character private key in under a second using Shor's Algorithm ;)
edit: added some specifics
@_date: 2014-05-08 01:49:32
Quantum computing works in an entirely different manner.  I'll dig up the specific scientific paper tomorrow, but length does not add much difficulty for [Shor's Algorithm](
I believe a 10000 character private key could be cracked in less than 1 second

"Version Control (aka Revision Control aka Source Control) lets you track your files over time. Why do you care? So when you mess up you can easily get back to a previous working version."
More basic info [here](
@_date: 2014-05-08 14:16:27
Quantum computers can run in polynomial time and this algorithm specifically can achieve an exponential increase in speed.  
This [table]( from the scientific paper 'Quantum Computing and Communications' by Sandor Imre shows that the 1s barrier for Shor's Algorithm is a 10,000 bit RSA key.  Brute force could crack a 128 bit key in a measley 0.58 of a year; a quantum computer with Shor's Algorithm could do it in 2*10^-5 seconds.

[USPS]( says it is a valid address.
Same with [smartystreets]( address verifier.
I'm glad punching it into google is a valid method of discovering if an address is real fake; do some real research.
Also, not every location has its satellite image updated frequently.  Youngstown, Ohio had a 6 year old image up till last year! I know this because I went to school there when there was major road construction downtown...years later, it was still on gmaps.

Grover's algorithm is pretty slow.  From my understanding, Shor's builds upon it and would be applicable in the same light.  I added the timings [here](

Lol, read it again bubs; I am a computer engineer but I still take classes from time to time like an engineer should...
The fact that you are dismissing a defined algorithm makes me skeptical that you are an engineer.  Your response doesn't even make much sense to what I said.
Anywho, I have nothing to prove to you...so later dude.

I'm not sure why you are asking if you are only investing a small amount such as $35...that isn't much of an investment and won't bankrupt you.
That said, if the price doubles in a year...you'll make about $35.  Everyone loves a 100% return on investment but is that really enough monetary gain to make it worth it?
