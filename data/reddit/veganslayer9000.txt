I don't really get the appeal for that either. When I see a riced out car, my first instinct isn't to admire the vehicle or the owners tastes, it's to get as far away as possible from the absolute idiot that's driving it before he kills us both.

i.e. bitcoin will ultimately save the environment by causing a deep recession ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Results are amplified in either direction. In the long term each downward movement would gradually eat away at your position, gradually reducing it to zero.

Don't allocate the majority of your investments to crypto, it really is anyone's guess where this is headed. If you're young I would suggest a mix of index, small caps, equity and high-yield bond funds, with only a tiny fraction going into BTC.

It seems that at least the rush is over for the moment, looking at a 15.000 BTC 24h volume on GDAX, versus &gt;80.000 a couple days earlier.

Sadly you may still have unlimited tax liability to your home country, even if you become a German resident, always check and double check the rules (I moved within the EU, though not the UK).

How can bitcoin be linked to either socialism or liberalism, that makes absolutely no sense, it's merely a medium of exchange. If anything it's a big middle finger to current monetary policy, which mind you, is dictated by central banks, ... which are usually independent institutions.

That's supposedly by design. The connection times out if you don't submit any share within 10 minutes, it immediately reconnects though, so it shouldn't matter. I've switched to WinMiner for the time being.

Unfortunately some people need to be protected from themselves, some of these mistakes cannot be recovered from. I can only hope someone would stop my grandma from wiring her life savings to a nigerian prince.

How does one use bitcoin for tax evasion if major expenditures can usually be linked to your person and transactions are a matter of public record?

Any information on who's providing the insurance? I'm really wondering what reputable insurance company is willing to take on such a risk, with the current number of high profile security breaches.

This is only for Australia. I agree that it's not wise to hold crypto for anyone else. But in the US (or Sweden, where I live), when you donate assets, the recipient is liable to pay capital gains tax on it. This can be very beneficial e.g. to perform the sale in a lower tax bracket, or to even out capital gains with capital losses or vice versa. All you need to make sure of, is that you're not selling them in your name.

This needs to be higher up, why would you donate if they're intent on staying anonymous.

My understanding was that strong job reports last Friday are feeding the fear for an interest rate hike from the fed to counter increasing inflation. The repo rate indirectly affects the stock market due to increased lending costs and a higher pressure on cash flow for companies. So it stands to reason that the market will correct. But at the moment it's not exactly the disaster some are making it out to be.

You're forgetting the compound return, it'd be even crazier at 26.8% annualized. You'd double your money in under three years.

Not arguing either for or against fractional reserve banking, just want to expand on it. That $90 will end up at a second bank, of which 90% will yet again end up at a third bank, and so on. The result is that for every $100 which is injected by a central bank, banks will effectively expand it to $1000 if you assume a 10% reserve.
