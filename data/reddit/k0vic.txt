Thats silly and I think you missed the point of bitcoin. Regulation, sanctions blah blah are all just glass ceilings that can stop bitcoin in the short term but not in the long. Bitcoin has the power to go mainstream with out the mainstream strings and cant' be controlled by a single gov but oh yes they will try.
The bitcoin hipster comment is funny lol

Dont' cash out. I looked into this same option. It's really not worth it and it's good to have as a backup plan anyhow. 
I ended up paying the min required into my 401k so my company would continue to match and then I buy another couple of % from my total gross worth of BTC every paycheck regardless of price.
So far this is working out very well and adding up quickly.

Why isn't anyone attacking it then? The coin has a pretty noticeable footprint that I think would make it a prime target, esp if it is so easy.
@_date: 2015-05-15 23:23:07
Which is a little to close to WMD
@_date: 2015-05-22 16:22:10
I'm in. I think this is a good idea but we should test for at least 30 minutes so we can get a little more data from  a couple of blocks....
@_date: 2015-05-29 19:23:28
people not doing things because it's illegal? Is that why gox is still around? 
If there is an attack that is easy and it leaves someone with the chance to profit large amounts, someone would do it. plain and simple. The fact that it is illegal isn't stopping anyone.

"Third, mobile banking will help the poor radically transform their lives. Today, some 2.5 billion people don't have access to cheap and easy financial services -- a problem that makes it much more difficult to be poor. If your savings is in the form of jewelry or livestock, for example, you can't very well chip off tiny pieces to cover routine daily expenses.
But in the next 15 years, digital banking will give the poor more control over their assets. The key will be mobile phones. Already, in developing countries with the right regulatory framework -- such as Bangladesh -- people are using their phones to store money digitally and make purchases. By 2030, 8% of the adults without bank accounts today will be doing the same.
And by then, mobile money providers will be offering the full range of financial services, from interest-bearing savings accounts to credit to insurance."

It is unlike them to go dark like that with no updates or planned maintenance that i'm aware of, esp with all the volume taking place.

In response to coinfire
I’d like to make a statement regarding coinfire’s article claiming we are lying about being fully licensed.
First off, we’ve never made any claims about being fully licensed at the state level.  I’m unsure where they received their information from, but like every other Bitcoin company in the US, we do not have state level MSB licenses.  Are we working to acquire them?  Yes, but the process can take years.
There is no company that is fully licensed at the state level in the US.  None.
Coinfire claims to have tried contacting us, but I’m unsure the method they were attempting.  I’ve not seen anything from them requesting information.   Had they asked, we would have told them that we do not have state level licenses - just like anybody else who asks that question.  They certainly would not have had to call state by state requesting information because we would have told them we do not carry state licenses.
We do, however, fully comply with our Federal MSB requirements.  This includes filing SAR (Suspicous Activity Reports) and CTR (Currency Transaction Reports).  We also have one of the most extensive KYC programs in the industry, scrub accounts against the OFAC list, and perform Transaction Monitoring.   At a federal level, we are compliant.  
Federal compliance is the only claim we have ever made and will make.
I invite the writer at coinfire to contact me so I can show him what we do have, and what we don’t.  I’m sure we could chat for hours about the woes of a Bitcoin related company attempting to get licenses from all the states.
It seemed to be a good investigation, but it was based on a false premise.

Yeah what about that other coin?
@_date: 2017-03-15 23:58:21
Hmm... here's a theory....
The big 3 were hacked a while back but never went public.
The POC shows up and demands the exchanges prove they are compliant and as a result they need to prove they are solvent. 
Since they are not, they freeze bitcoin withdrawals and used the POC excuse which isn't technically a lie. 
The big 3 begin buying bitcoin and benefit from the disapproval of the ETF, which is what possibly held bitcoin up given all the latest drama. 
Samson Mow leaves BTCC (maybe just coincidental)
Maybe this is what is driving the Alt pump, adding alts to their exchanges and are trying to make up for the loss by cashing out on the pump and making $ from the trades on their exchange. Maybe insider trading due to the above....
spelling/grammar is shit, i'm on a mobile....

Coindesk, even when they are right, they are wrong. Sites down again....

Is this similar to what Dash did with instant X send a couple months ago?
@_date: 2016-03-04 22:03:37
+1 .... I've had so many smart guys like this work for me and they just don't get it.. esp developers... 
No solution is perfect, be agile, expect failure, learn and move on or.... do nothing until you think your soultion is perfect. The latter is how you lose. Every time.
@_date: 2017-03-16 00:05:23
yep, and I dont' think they were trying to hold up the price, maybe just buying what they can to become solvent again and the result is holding up the price.

i see what you did there.
@_date: 2015-07-07 14:07:02
Maybe not broken but there are some fucky things going on. I agree the response from even the Devs have been "egh, just trolls" 
If bitcoin was my infrastructure my NOC would be raising all kinds of alerts right now. If you do that in bitcoin world, your a troll and the response is what you'd expect from a developer. 
Example: per "And? :) It's working fine right now too-- people happily reporting fast confirmations on low fee transactions, etc... as there are miners that identify the floods and lower their priority or block them.
Don't think that it hasn't been attacked every day for years. The only difference now is the organized effort to make a big deal about it on reddit... when the system is sound, attack the people."
This just feels like a brush off/ pass the buck.

This is more of an acknowledgment and constructive info to whats going on than what we have received from bitcoin's dev team. 
Thanks for the input , keep up the good work.

This drives me nuts, bitcoin can not become scarcer unless the coins are lost. In fact more coins are created everyday until we hit the cap and they will trade hands, some will hold, some will use as currency  but they aren't a resource that's being used up like uranium.
