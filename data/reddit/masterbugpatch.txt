A shite shouldn't crash from only 10,000 views even if only 5 minutes given..
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:06:54
Putting a ref link? Really.

The person who "The Wolf of Wall Street" is based off of actually just made the news for calling Bitcoin a scam. Google it.

People shouldn't be allowed to post on unless they pass a quiz first...
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:11:22
Why do you need to know about Nicehash for a bitcoin club?

Yeah no, I could recreate that within an hour for free. On top of that, there's no point to recreating what's been made.

The best way to do it is to just use a semi-high fee and wait for that first confirmation
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:57:48
Sadly yes then, unless you used a web wallet or such.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:15:51
Look for other places he may have put the keys: friends, containers, etc.

@_date: 2017-12-09 09:05:11
I'm willing to attempt tackling this though I'd like having you on Skype/Discord or something where I can immediately ask you questions. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:46:25
Get a nicely decorated one, and use Segwit wallets so you and the recipients won't be screwed over by fees.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:48:25
Gyft is amazing, but right now with the high transaction fees, you will always be screwed over nonetheless.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:26:35
It seems that you may want to look more into how hardware wallets work...
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:38:54
Kid, it's in their LEGAL agreement. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:25:25
Yeah sure thing
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:25:57
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:34:37
That's sweet but I think you should probably just give them actual paper wallets and stress to them the importance that if they lose that, they lose their money.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:19:00
If you add on me on Skype: masterbugpatch , I'll be more than willing to help you :).
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:39:03
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:33:27
I'll make it for a small price xD
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:17:39
Coinbase allows children accounts, you just need to submit your normal minor ID. They will then contact you with parental forms and such.

Segwit Paper! With holiday color :)
Make sure you print them out and don't lose them. You may also want to print on nice paper.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:30:46
Segwit paper wallet:

Add me on Skype: masterbugpatch
I'm willing to try helping you in this recovery for a small fee :) Or maybe just kindness
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:25:40
Yeah sure thing
@_date: 2018-05-20 19:03:50
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:19:09
Actually I think it just goes by the old tick, BCC :p.
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:07:15
Sure thing, it's fetching them from api.cryptonator.com and is set to do so every 8 seconds and on page load :).
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:55:51
