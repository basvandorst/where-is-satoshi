Ugh sorry. Can't say mine was all that fat, just fun to finally be a little bit ahead. I woke up to a headline 120,000 BTC Stolen, I was like SWEET let me check my position! Oh hell. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:10:04
Ha, yeah thankfully my  losses are measly, was just playing around the platform with very little BTC. What's laughable is the result of the my strategy finally working, only to be met with this brick wall in the end. I am the king of buying high selling low and vice versa, hence I don't do this much, drives me nuts. This time I was like "YES"! Until I saw who was hacked...
I really do feel bad for those who had substantial assets there. So risky keeping coins with a 3rd party, even with so called trustworthy destinations. Yet another harsh growing pain for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:44:25
I saw a comment somewhere of a guy who lost something like 43 bitcoins and had to explain it all to his wife, he is now sleeping on the couch. Sorry for your losses, but hope this hack is a little less significant to your bankroll than it was to his! 
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:23:15
It's all speculative. This entire architecture is a gamble. You can cold storage all the coins you want and it won't matter if the Bitcoin core is ever compromised or stressed beyond its utility. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:37:01
Whether they are worth something is Bitcoin's entire reason of being at this moment in time. It's all speculation. If you still have your coins and the core is compromised, and those precious coins become as worthless as a blank Word document on your hard drive or post-it-note in your safe, who cares if your coins are still your coins? You, because you gambled on a very different outcome. 
I am rooting for Bitcoin and hope this never happens, I wish you and everyone else to the moon someday.

Cool, signed up yesterday, just waiting for confirmation. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:02:17
Yeah that too, that has been really annoying. I was finally able to get in by going to gdax.com, but instead of logging in, go to "View Exchange", then useing the login widget on the left. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:00:21
I have seen the spread around $1500 between gdax and Bitstamp. Once this spread is around 7%, in a perfect world you could buy using credit card on bitstamp, send to coinbase and cash out at a profit. Only issue is transaction fees are so high, and the confirmation wait times are so long, its too much of a hassle/gamble to play the arbitrage game like this. If this could all be instantaneous, and cheap, it would literally be free money. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:22:23
Aside from being able to withdraw a significant amount from Coinbase, why isn't everyone doing this? I mean, buy from Bitstamp, , send to DGAX and place a sell order. Transfer USD to Coinbase and withdraw over time. Am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:09:17
All the exchanges have a different price, it becomes an opportunity for arbitrage when the price difference is wide enough. $1000 difference may not be worth it these days. Problem is, you have to account for funding time and transaction fees that are so high now that the opportunity is hard to capitalize on.

He may have been blowing off steam - but his issue does addresses exactly what my question was concerning. 
All emotion aside, this, too me, seems like a huge risk for merchants accepting Bitcoin right now. 
Why not: Customer buys product, leaves store, double spends to himself with a higher mining fee before the first confirmation. Merchant is SOL. Right? Am I missing something?
@_date: 2014-01-31 23:38:26
Yes, its is the next revision of the Bitcoin protocol. Right now it is 0.8.6 . 
Here is some info about some of the next revision features, including changes to mining fees:

Yes, especially if he applies a higher mining fee to it. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:54:56
BitpPay credits to your currency at least once a day, but only for transactions which have had over 6 confirmations. If there is a failure due to double-spend, or never being confirmed due to low transaction value + 0 mining fee, the merchant is responsible for this loss.
@_date: 2014-03-04 20:51:45

Yes, and that is given the 1st confirmation happens within 10 minutes. It could also take hours. 
I know the devs are looking at ways to mitigate this, but I am really curious if this has affected merchants already. 
@_date: 2014-01-31 15:59:03
I think its only irreversible once there is a confirmation. You could double-spend an unconfirmed transaction with a higher fee, and this higher fee one will get propagated and confirmed. Then, if the 0 fee one ever does get around to being confirmed by a miner, it will get dumped as a double-spend, even though it was chronologically the first one sent.
@_date: 2014-10-07 19:36:14
Thank you. I am trying to wrap my head around the incentive for miners to continue mining, especially a few decades from now when all the coins are minted. 
It seems to me many people will drop out, but that will then decease the difficulty, making it easier to mine with slightly less expensive resources. Granted it will only be to recover the mining fees at that point, but mining would still have to remain profitable for miners to continue participating. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 18:25:33
UPDATE: So coinpunk works pretty well now. I had to take the QR photo 4 times to get it to read though, so still not quite as seamless as app-based wallets.

It does cover all of the above, according to the creator of the tool. Purchases are a tax event. Being paid is income. Mining is income at date of receipt at fair market value. Here is a comment about all of this from the creator of this tool:

Not necessarily. With blockchain.info, unconfirmed sends will be dropped after a few days and the sender's wallet will have the money in it (from what I understand).

Blockchain.info wallet. 
Enable 2 factor authentication in the "Security" tab. 
Enable Second Password in the "Passwords" tab (make it different from your main password. 
You can optionally use this tool to create a cold wallet. 
I agree that cold wallets are the safest, but you still then need to secure your cold wallet. For 5BTC, I'm not sure if I would go through the hassle. For 500 BTC, I would. That is a personal decision based on your risk comfort though. 
@_date: 2014-01-31 16:03:58
0.9 has a lot of innovation planned around the topic of mining fees. The discussion of having the recipient (merchant in this case) pay the mining fee is also in the works - makes way more sense.

Certainly, I have my personal thresholds. Hoping to have that problem in 3 years... 
@_date: 2014-01-08 00:54:18
I have been researching this exact conundrum for months, with all the varying information seen in this thread. I also have a post about it here from a month ago:
I have spoken with other people, merchants, lawyers, online bitcoin communities and so on about this scenario. It always comes back to this same answer given by - in your TOS, state that "All Prices In USD At Time Of Transaction" - no matter what payment method, no matter if it is a purchase or a return. 
What if a person purchased a piece of art from you in USD, and the the art skyrockets in value the next day due to some fortunate media coverage of the artist? Does the customer get to return the art to you at the current value of the piece of art? If the value falls, does the merchant get to process the return but for less money? No, the return is at the USD price it was purchased for - no matter what the current market value of the art is.
In this case, the art, like the bitcoins, are simply a store of value. Bitcoins are just a store of value. Market volatility is something everyone deals with with everything in life - but Bitcoin is so volatile right now that it is seen in extreme measures and questions like this are coming up. 
Price in USD, sell in USD, return in USD. This is not bad business or bad for business. It is fair for all parties involved in Bitcoin, merchant and customer alike. As a deflationary currency which is rising and falling in value rapidly, you can guarantee scammers are going to try to exploit this, so update your TOS immediately. 
In the US, this seems to be perfectly legal - this may not be the case in other jurisdictions. 
For some business, simply stating "All Sales Final" is the solution. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:27:47
I see - so stopping withdraws was maybe less likely due to the vulnerability, but rather due to the fact that they could not afford the payouts?
@_date: 2014-03-25 18:38:42
Yes, its why sites like this were created long ago:
I hope this will be a standard feature of comprehensive Bitcoin wallets or financial management tools in the future. 
@_date: 2014-01-31 16:10:26
The miner won't care about the chronology of the transactions, all they care about is the fee. They will process the higher fee one, then the other one will get dropped. 
@_date: 2014-01-31 17:30:24
OK, so I, for instance, have some test transactions that are out there on the network unconfirmed. They were micro transactions configured with 0 fee, just to see what happens. Now, I cannot use my wallet to send anything as it complains about these transactions holding up my funds, even though enough in the wallet to send more. 
If I do nothing, what happens to these transactions? Will I ever get my BTC back? Will my wallet reconcile these so I can spend once again? If not, how do I initiate a double-spend with a fee to clear these out?
 (this one was sent yesterday)

@_date: 2014-01-31 17:26:27
How did you handle this? Did you have record of who the sender was? I worry for merchants whose customers are long gone by the time they realize this. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:14:00

It is store credit in USD. 
This is not rare for companies to do, although some customers may be upset when they learn they cannot get a full refund for an unwanted item. 
One problem with refunding back to Bitcoin at current value of USD, is that you run the risk of not being able to refund the exact amount. You may initiate $35.87 refund, but once the conversion from BTC-USD is done, the recipient may be a a cent or two short if there is no exact exchange calculation. Several times I have sent $5 to people, and it came through as $4.99. This was not due to transaction fees, as these was all done within Coinbase. It was the way the math worked out with the exchange rate calculation. Being that the USD is only 2 decimal places, it is not always exact.

So, they basically trusted the transactions and allowed funds to be withdrawn, only to find out later that they were invalid? 
Couldn't this have been solved by waiting for confirmations before allowing fiat funds withdrawal?
@_date: 2014-01-31 15:56:04
I am not 100% sure about that. I read recently that you if the transaction is not confirmed yet, you can stop transmitting it form your QT client, and they network will forget about it. 
Unconfirmed transactions are not guaranteed to get into the block chain after a certain amount of time, especially 0 fee transactions. They can be unconfirmed forever. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 13:21:10

@_date: 2014-02-26 19:52:25
Just to clarify - Bitpay does not do this for you. 
They let you accept 0 conf transaction so your customers don't have to hang around. But, the onus of loss is on the merchant if the transaction never gets confirmed, or if there is a successful race attack (double spend). 
BitPay's fees are in no way an insurance for transaction failures. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:25:31
How is this handled with apps like Square?

"Is it possible to complete a transaction in 30 seconds with a 0% chance getting scammed afterwards and what are the odds?"
No, but odds are highly unlikely.
Have you ever lost revenue due to counterfeit cash or credit card chargebacks? A bitcoin double-spend attack is the same sort of risk, albeit far less likely (in my opinion) due to the sheer luck and HUGE expense it would take to carry one off successfully. You must weight this risk.
Trusting 0 confirmation transactions, and letting your customer leave the store is a risk you will have to assume as part of your business model. Not a good idea for extremely high value items - those may be worth an attacker's resources. 
The other thing to consider is micro-transactions. What if a customer purchased a stick of gum, and applied a 0 mining fee? It likely will never get confirmed, and you will not get paid. This, I think, is more of a risk than a double-spend. 
I would imagine, at the end of the year, your losses due to fraudulent Bitcoin transactions (dollar for dollar) would be far less than your losses due to merchandise theft, check forgery, charge-backs, and cash counterfeiting.

@_date: 2017-10-19 19:17:45
Well, he is a close friend and new to crypto. Honest newb mistake, I should have checked his wallet before sending the coins. I am just shocked the addresses between BCH and BTC are so similar that this could happen in the first place. Need to educate myself too.  
@_date: 2017-10-19 20:00:53
Ah, so this address did not exists on the BTC chain until I sent funds to it? It then created the BTC address, and I can use the BCH private key to associate it? 
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:45:28
I'm in the same boat. Kraken uses XBT acronym, and my friend sent my a Bitcoin Cash deposit address to send funds to because he did not recognize XBT. Now, Kraken has his funds in BCH which they could private key sweep into a BTC account, but they refuse to do it.
 
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:14:55
Hm. Even if this is a new BCH address? Isn't it on a different blockchain?

@_date: 2017-10-20 13:31:31
Well, I think this is a lost cause. I personally looked at his wallet last night, turns out it was Kraken account, not a personal wallet. We emailed Kraken and asked if they could do this process for us, seeing as they own the private keys, and they have said no - it would be too technically burdensome for them. 
Sounds like it would be quite easy for them to do this, but they just don't want to.

This is what I would suggest, but again how to issue a refund? Convert USD back to BTC at a much higher rate and potentially lose a ton of money just for a return?
Of course this could work in favor of the merchant, but then the customer is at the short end of the deal.

@_date: 2013-12-06 18:48:13
I see. As I asked - can this be done with merchant tools like Coinbase or Bitpay automatically? I do not see this as an option in Coinbase's merchant interface, but maybe it does it automatically with each new transaction?
@_date: 2013-12-07 14:31:27
If you send a payment with a 0 fee, is there a chance it will never get confirmed? Or will it just take longer to be confirmed? 
As a merchant I can see why fees would be helpful. But for personal use, I would not want to pay fees on money transfers between family and friends. If the system is only designed to be inexpensive for large transactions, how does that help any of us who want to use it for everyday use?
At any rate, it does look like this micro payment fee issue is pretty high list of debate topics. Interesting to see these issues arise as the value of Bitcoins skyrockets. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:33:26
Excellent post, thank you. 
I agree, a business accepting Bitcoin should do so extremely cautiously. I believe it should be experimented with, a way to generate marketing while not actually selling items which are absolutely necessary to hit margin. 
As for the savings capitalization topic, that is a very interesting way to look at it. I am not sure what government incentives are given to small business to offset the merchant rates of the big banks. But yes, I assume Bitcoin mining and merchant fees would not be eligible for these write-offs. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:39:51
I really don't care how long it takes in this case, and I did not specify offering a fee of a speedier delivery in my Blockchain.info wallet.

Or purchase goods. Capital gains must be paid if you convert back to USD, or spend on goods (and services?). Goods have value. If you spend your profit on goods, you have now converted your profits to a new form of value (goods). Therefore, you must pay the capital gains on this. 
Just as if you buy a vintage car, and it gains value, and you sell it. You must pay capital gains on this profit.

Here in lies the problem. If a customer buys an item from you, and BTC is worth $700 today. But tomorrow BTC is worth $1000 and now wants to return that item. Are you willing to return that item with a USD loss of $300 (if the item cost $700)?
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:01:57
They charge 2.75 % for every transaction. Far above BTC merchant fees, and so they seem more like a competitor to Paypal than anything else. 
However, if they were to get into the Bitcoin merchant business, like Bitpay, maybe they would be able to introduce much lower transaction fees than 2.75 % for BTC purchases.

I think a lot of people truly believe in Bitcoin, but need to covert it back to fiat in order to pay the rent, bills, payroll, etc. This is too new to rely on as a complete replacement for local currency. 
Due to the risky volatility of the market, merchant tools such as Coinbase and Bitpay even provide the ability to immediately sent BTC purchases to the business checking account, this mitigating market volatility risk. 
So, lets say a small business does this. They sell a shirt for BTC, which immediately is withdrawn to the business's USD checking account. A week later, the customer wants to return the shirt. The business now has to buy-back BTC at a potentially much higher rate to give that customer a BTC refund. Or, can the business give the USD equivalent in the current BTC amount?
Yes, a business could just leave BTC in BTC, and provide refunds this way regardless of volatility. But still, you run the chance of retuning an item which, at in terms of USD, has an extraordinary higher value today than when it was purchased. 
says he re-wrote is business's TOS to say that all returns will be in USD equivalent. This sounds like it may be a stop-gap in the meantime. However, market volatility is so wild, that if I try to send $1 in BTC, the actual dollar value will be slightly different once the transaction is complete. Without refunding BTC in BTC, it is practically impossible to offer a true 1 for 1 refund.

Thank you, this makes sense. There is probably 1 person at this bar who knows what is going on, and that person was probably not one of the people I spoke with on the phone. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:34:16
Do you refund in BTC or USD? If BTC, how do you handle the volatility of the market if someone returns an item and demands an exact BTC refund, but BTC has skyrocketed since then? I am asking proprietors this question as I am curious how this is being addressed. I have a post with a hypothetical scenario here: 
@_date: 2013-11-15 01:54:40
This seems by far the most logical answer. Thank you for this writeup. 
You also illuminated how absolutely convoluted this will be for people like me. I plan recurring buys often. I also intend to spend often. I also *hope* BTC continues to rise in value. If this is the case, I will have many, many lots, I just have no idea how to manage all of this in a practical manner.
@_date: 2013-12-15 21:55:30
Yeah, this is wild. Especially as others reference having the same issue in this thread. I mean, this should be next to impossible - just as guessing a wallet address should be...
@_date: 2013-12-09 14:39:55
Thanks for the response. The more I think about it, the more I agree as well. Also, someone from recommended stating that all sales are final. Of course, as a tutoring business I can see why this may not become too much of an issue for your. Best of luck to you!

A 5 % fee? What service did you use? Coinbase is only 1% for Bitcoin purchases using USD. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:01:48
Agreed. Coinbase really is great so far, it is the most intuitive, friendly interface I have experienced. The Blockchain.info wallet is also nice, but not quite as intuitive for non-technical people like Coinbase is. 
Its too bad the Coinbase app was removed from the Apple app store. I feel moves like this from the likes of Apple and such will continue to be an unnecessary roadblock in innovation.

Interesting, thanks for this.

I have looked at Bitpay, but again this is a separate POS technically. I would have to bring a separate device to my customers. What if I want to split checks, some pay with cash, some with credit, some with BTC? This is very easy in Micros, but now I have a whole new system to splice in if I use Bitpay.

AS for myself, I use whole disk encryption on my laptop and would protect the keys in an encrypted vault, if I went with the method. So far I have not decided on a backup solution outside of coinbase as of yet. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 01:52:28
Is this really true? If I have a 1000% return on my investment, and buy a car but pay sales tax, I do not owe capital gains on my $1000 profit? 
@_date: 2013-11-10 19:51:05
I'd probably use TrueCyrpt for this. I use it whenever I need to store sensitive info to disk. Very portable too, can store the TrueCyrpt vault anywhere.  
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:56:07
Some people do not have BTC yet, they are looking for a place to buy them for the first time. You cannot buy them directly on BTC-E, or at least not easily and fast like Coinbase for initial investors. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 16:04:38
This is frightening for anyone who wants to develop, or is developing custom integrations with the Coinbase API. 
But, I guess this could happen with Bitpay's API too right?
Is it possible the API key had been emailed to someone, written down somewhere, or otherwise used somewhere which could have been compromised? If not, and this was done by brute force, I wonder how Coinbase plans to mitigate this?
@_date: 2013-11-10 19:41:14
I guess in this case I am hoping that I would realize the laptop is stolen right away. Fast enough to transfer the BTC before the thief even discovers there are valuable BTC on the laptop. Of course, if the theft goes unnoticed for a long while, then I can see why a transfer may be the first indication of a theft. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 14:04:37
Awesome, thanks for the update!

I am not sure what the return policy on a Mercedes Benz is. But if you can return a car within x number of days/weeks, do you plan to refund in BTC or USD? If BTC, how would you handle the volatility of the market if someone returns an item and demands an exact BTC refund, but BTC has skyrocketed since then? I am asking Reddit proprietors this question as I am curious how this is being addressed. I have a post with a hypothetical scenario here: 
Also, I started a Bitpay application 3 weeks ago and it is still pending. You will be waiting a very long time for a Bitpay approval as they are swamped with new applications. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:40:13
Excellent, thanks! Good to know, so it really is important if a vendor chose to manually accept a payment from someone for a special reason, instead of using their merchant tools, that they create a new address manually and never use it again.

Good question. In order to be a highly functional Bitcoin merchant tool, they would have to provide the same type of features in the works with services like Coinbase and Bitpay. This could mean providing off-blockchain transactions for 0 mining fees and instant confirmations. No idea how much this architecture would cost Square, but that 2.75 % fee would certainly be put to use! 
My guess, Apple would tell Square to remove Bitcoin functionality from the app anyway. Apple's resistance to Bitcoin is in direct correlation with their own self interests as a central digital currency transaction system themselves with their Passbook feature. 
I am a long time Apple customer, but I think their vision and innovative spirit has peaked, and been trampled by their focus on market cap. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 21:44:52
That math ads up I guess. What is the reason for the delay however? If BTC is supposed to be this fast electronic transfer solution, why the long wait? Especially seeing as the money cleared my checking account so fast?
Just trying to understand the inner workings of the exchange market.

Does anyone know who those are sitting on the panel?

People do need to be reminded of this. Almost every conversation about cryptocurrency leads to allegations about how it can be abused for criminal purposes. Every time I say the same thing, "Just like the USD". And every time, they have the same "oh yeah..." reaction. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:57:12
Even at .0001, which is 9 cents, this is a huge cost to send just $1. 
Thanks for the link, sounds like a good idea to calculate the fee based on the market. Curious to see where this goes. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 13:33:31
Sorry for the delay. Just ordered, but ran into a checkout issue. You probably got an order,  . However, you did not get payment. I went to pay via coinbase, and chose the method to log in to my coinbase account. It sent me to coinbase, but once it logged me in it just sent me to my account page. I had no way of going back to see what I owed you and send you the money. So, I backed out, but then it showed my cart as empty and I saw in my email that the order went through. 
So, how would you like to handle it? You could email me at the address in the order with a QR code and I can send you the BTC. Or, you can cancel the order and I will re-order using the QR code/Confirm method on your website. Either way is good for me. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 14:22:42
Having an issue with the checkout portion of the website. On the left is the "Billing Address" section, and on the right is the "Your Order" frame. When I start typing in my billing info, the Your Order pane grays out, and I cannot continue with the order. There is a spinning wheel in the middle of the grayed out Your Order section. 
I have tried with Firefox and Safari on a Mac, same results.

For sake of discussion, lets assume a real world restaurant a friend on mine owns. When they opened, they wanted to use iPads/iPhones. It was a business decision they made to not allow staff to use personal devices for business transactions. So, they started to use iPads but then even that was not efficient for the staff to use, and customers were confused as most people are still used to having a paper bill. So, they went back to the paper bill system and they run the checks at the register. 
Once again, my other concerns is about reconciliation with the central POS system. If I have all these devices making transactions, how to I reconcile all those transactions with my central business POS? That is simply too much to have to do by hand every night. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 01:30:05
This would be a fantastic feature. I mean, there a many, many features I would like to see too, but this is way up there.

I think by 5:00pm PST. I think I read this in a post a few days ago, Coinbase is located in SF, so at end of their business day. Let us know if they come through. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 21:31:06
Appreciated. I would also imagine Bitpay can send email receipts to the business owner, to a unique email address, which in turn can simply be added to the register at the end of the night. Hmm.. 
What about tips though? If someone leaves a 20% tip on Bitpay, how do I get that money to the employee? Give them the USD equivalent out of the register just as I would with a credit card? Again, employees are supposed to claim tips at the register, so it can then do all the accounting at the end of the year for the business. I see having a separate BTC database complicating the accounting, possibly.
Edit: This duo seems to have explained the tipping part, still curious about reconciling the transactions and getting the tip to the staff member. 
I sent an email to BitPay regarding a lot of this too. I am sure they have some good ideas too. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:59:06

"When a capital asset is sold, the difference between the amount you paid for the asset and the amount you sold it for is a capital gain or capital loss."
Now, in your example, you have put work into the house since you purchased it. These work items can count towards your capital investment. So, if you sold the house for "original purchase price+fixerupper cost = sales price" then no, you are right you would not pay capital gains because it would be an even wash.
However, if you purchased the house today, and sold it tomorrow at a profit - yes you would owe capital gains. This is where Bitcoin comes in. I have multiple buys, each profiting (right now a lot) in their own right. I am not investing capital to even out the gains, I am simply making gains. If I spend down my amount, I am technically spending my profit. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:38:25
Thanks, I will check with each vendor to see how they handle it.

If this story is true, then its great OP and the new BTC merchants had such a positive experience. I just wonder though, this seems like an awfully risky move for a merchant to just up and go for at the word of a stranger. Especially merchants who have barely heard of Bitcoin before. 
There is so much to learn about Bitcoin, especially security, that I hope they do not get taken to the cleaners somehow before they are fully aware of how to manage Bitcoin finances. I guess, if it were me, I would not feel comfortable setting up a business until they had time to fully investigate the risks and opportunities this technology presents. 
Still, glad to hear a growing number of small businesses are open to this type of innovation. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:10:41
With small business, I think it is even more imperative that there be some stability to the BTC payment and receiving systems.  Coinbase and BitPay offer this, but even still there are lots of points of view surround the whole confirmations-wait-time stuff. Small business often cannot afford to have customers waiting around at the counter for confirmations. This is another reason I really wanted to try this out in person. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:10:18
Interesting. I emailed out State Attorney General's office to see what their take is on this.

Can this be done automatically with merchant tools like Coinbase or Bitpay?
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:57:28
I want Bitcoin to succeed. With all the huge media attention, skyrocketing value, etc, people are flocking to this in droves. I fear that the adoption is happening faster than innovation right now, and this could be dangerous for all of us if something terrible happens on a large scale.

And to add to that, is your Coinbase account set up to auto-withdraw to your bank account immediately upon transaction? If so, you would have to re-buy that Bitcoin in order to issue a refund, and possibly at a much larger buy rate.

Appreciated. Yes, I do plan on moving to a cold storage system soon, as soon as I am more confident in my own cold storage solution than I am of Coinbase's 2-factor auth and their so called 87% offline cold storage system. 
OK, so at least what I should do in the meantime is download the blockchain.info wallet to my phone, and send a small amount of my Coinbase BTC to a deposit address for the wallet, yes? This way I can use the funds on the wallet app on my phone to scan a QR code and complete the transaction?
