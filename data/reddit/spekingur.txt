On a semi-related note: Isn't Paypal going up for sale soon or was that news bullshit?

Presumed guilty of a shooting and suspected to be used in a shooting are two different things. Presuming guilt implies intent and intent is not something things/items do inherently. Intent is not the same as function. 
It isn't the intent of a gun to be shot, it is the function of it (or one of the functions of it). For example, humans that make a gun may intend it to be shot - as in, perform a function it was designed to do - and humans that use a gun intend to shoot it - again, a designed function.

Aren't these laws then applying intent to things that can't? Essentially saying, items are living beings able of decision making?

I still use GoDaddy but only because I have already paid for the service. Soon it needs to renew and at that time I will change service provider - although I have no idea how bothersome it will be to do so. Also, the GoDaddy service spam mail annoys me.

That's because millionaires wire millions and not thousands.

I'm from Iceland. Sigur Rós is from Iceland. There is a Sigur Rós music video on Youtube that Icelanders can't watch. This whole regional thing is fucked up.
