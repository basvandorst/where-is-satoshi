I can't address one person over the internet without it applying to half the population of the world? Fuck off.  "l33t haxor type" is like a piss take of technologically competent people who think they're underground hackers
 I'm talking about what I perceive to be a superiority complex, have you read her other comments in this thread?




An average person is capable of understanding long technical explanation. She makes a good point about relating it to more popular hobbies and how it could benefit them but I don't like the underlying elitism and it's that kind of attitude that will kill cryptocurrencies.

Jesus christ lady! Just because you follow bitcoin doesn't make you some l33t haxor type

Fuck. I was going to buy some yesterday but I figured it would be cooling down a bit over the next week
@_date: 2013-12-20 11:23:39
so what kind of cut are bitpay making from that?

I'm considering it but think it'd be cool to show them that bitcoin can be used in the real world rather than just some numbers on paper. Although it would probably be a good decision in the long term, I think if I gave my kid sister a bunch of numbers for christmas she'd be very unimpressed. I plan on buying them some bitcoin in the near future anyway.

I also started my account with a tip :D 
It blew my mind to see that the value of the tip had doubled in the space of 2 weeks and now I'm becoming dangerously obsessed with the bitcoin market

I remember trying really hard to buy them when they were around 15 dollars but gave up because it's awkward as fuck to buy them from here
