me too, and got denied. won't give any reason and clean as a whistle. good luck
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:08:56
ah, well ... I did say 'maybe'. didn't know where they were, that sucks.
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:25:05
yeah, because BTC only has one function - a store of value. the alts exist because they are solving other real world problems, hence the explosive growth. diversify or watch everyone else plow ahead

got in around Dec 1st, read a bunch on these forums and haven't been bothered at all since. just listen to the old timers and the patterns. just hodl, don't give in to FUD or FOMO. watched my 2k grow to almost 15k the last couple weeks, then drop back to 5500. oh well, it will be back stronger soon. buy the dips in prep for later this year.

Hold on while I consult my crystal ball to get the information you think I have before I have it. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:55:58
and much more likely to walk with a profit
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:22:53
balance. you'll see much greater gains long term. BTC has it's place, but the major growth going forward will be the alts that are offering other real world solutions

the best bet is to get big money to invest in some lobbyists (throw together a Crypto Pool). paying off politicians via legal channels usually does wonders 
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:28:19
and this is why it's a good time to get into it and make some $$ before the masses *really* start coming in.
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:35:12
happy to help. let us know if it worked for you
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:54:28
I'm not, I don't do BTC
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:55:00
took them 2 weeks to verify KYC for me, in the meantime 3 other exchanges had me approved (also KYC) within 1-3 days of application. so I haven't even bothered to use them
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:04:13
why would they want to expose any trade secrets?
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:36:03
I could care less, I don't hold either and IMO the true future of blockchain is in other projects. that said, NEVER say "I hope everyone realizes this is the very same coin that shifted the paradigm of technology and created an entryway to a new generation of technology and wealth!" ... because YOU obvisouly don't realize that 1st out means absolutely nothing in the long run, it is purely a short term mentality. who cares who is first, in the end its who has the better overall technical solutions. Microsoft Zune - 1st out, but where is it now? Apple Newton? TIVO? Nintendo Virtual Boy? Mapquest? MySpace? where are all these 1st gen technologies now? 
hodl all you want, but I think a lot of folks are looking at 2nd gen and 3rd gen blockchain tech to take us into the true future of blockchain

RemindMe! 6 months
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:22:38
it has taken anywhere from an hour or two to many hours of waiting. the .01 is your test .... why send the rest until you know the test works? otherwise your 'test' is a worthless waste of transaction fees if you are just going to gamble that you got it right the first time anyways
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:45:53
then it sucks more when it costs $10-15 now just to move $100
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:26:20
in this scenario we are at least 10-20 years into the future and folks will be regularly using crypto currency and cold hard cash will be used much less. 
IMO we will reach a point in technology where we can just manufacture gold ... which is the backbone of modern day cash. so what will the value of cash be based on at that point? this is where the crypto market will take over and cash turns into a sad meme
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:32:32
 you are missing the button that says 'Yes, but I lost 1/2 to transaction fees'
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:12:44
yeah, this has worked out real well for all the other hacks and stolen coins. they'll just launder and wash it through multiple channels
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:36:50
just waiting for them to approve/verify. in the meantime, I dreaded using CB today ... at least it worked without issues. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:35:56
hmmm, somehow I missed the 'Crazy Christian' flair. you do know that God *made* mycelium right? you aren't disparaging God are you?
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:29:18
congrats, but OOOF!! if you only put in $20, the transaction fees alone for BTC means you probably only got @ $10 or less. definitely read more and dive into the information before going much deeper
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:09:13
I use Crypto Tracker on android, should have a similar for iOS
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:10:25
might be a way to turn around the extreme resentment a lot of folks feel towards them rn . I'm guessing they have seen an exodus of users in the last couple weeks (even with all the new users trying to join in)
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:25:43
I proposed to my wife on mycelium .... oh wait, wrong subreddit ...
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:38:04
this seems to be designed for exchanges and not the individual user. as an individual user, I would be paying additional fees for transactions and realize less ROI. an exchange it would work great. However, here is the caveat. no one puts much faith in exchanges not getting hacked, so we store in hardware wallets and not much on the exchanges unless you are doing a lot of volume trading. so why would this be useful for the average investor?
am I getting this right?

sounds legit
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:53:14
ultimately, yes. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:47:32
after transaction fees, he has @ $2 left .... 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:44:35
no cryto investment is safe, it is all very volatile and no one knows what will happen. the same can be said for the beginnings of the internet as well but look where we are. do your homework and decide if it's a good route for you to take.  
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:20:37
what!?!?! Faux news lying?!?! say it isn't so  /s
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:06:30
lol. have some humor. it's the current state of things and it's funnier because newbs will buy small amounts of BTC and wonder 'why did all my money go to transaction fees?'. sure the issue will get resolved by the sounds of things, which is why i continue to follow. but in the meantime I play with smaller $$ and ETH is a better transactor in the market currently. but things change rapidly

ignorance of the law is no excuse. *unless you are law enforcement, a politician or part of the 1% ... then you get a gate pass to do whatever the fuck you want

you sure it isn't the indefensible killings and then them getting paid vacations until it all blows over and back on the job bullshit? 
@_date: 2018-03-03 04:48:30
then use one of the *many* other exchange options out there. after all the fiascos I'm seriously surprised people are still relying on them
@_date: 2018-03-03 05:31:10
bittrex is US based. coss.io is Singapore based, but working on being the most compliant (soon out of beta ... like this month. + fiat coming this month)
@_date: 2018-03-21 18:41:36
this is why these posts are pure shit IMO and just clog up space with useless dribble. the market fluxuates, heavily ... get over it and STFU .... if you are in this or any other crypto sub, you probably already know. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 05:48:55
they are waiting on some final regulations coming out from Singapore legislation in April to finalize some things, but they are embedded into the crypto space there and the CEO is active on Telegram (a rarity). lots of new hires to accelerate implementation of the fiat gateway and compliance. they actually have a pretty nice fee split allocation with their token too. but for the exchange and fiat part, I'd wait another month and half or two and by that time things should be in place. they really take the compliance part very seriously and have a good roadmap for upcoming goodies to cover a lot of bases in the crypto space 
my worry about CC is not only this lawsuit, but also potential issues with fed investigations on these same issues that could lockdown the exchange. I only use them as a fiat gateway now and don't keep anything there
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:16:53
not saying your post was shit (actually agreeing), I'm talking about these posts in general with the price. '$9000!!' .... an hour later $8500!!! .... a couple more hours later $9500!!!   just getting sick of seeing this shit clog up the board, it's useless. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:20:36
or invested at $20k and wanting that return back quicker ....

Colorado? I've heard some nightmares from friends that weren't aware of the 'common law marriage' thing. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:43:50
sticking/weird point can be (2. The parties must have agreed that they are husband and wife.) - one guy I knew had simply implied for a few years that they would eventually get married after she finished school, but time residing together + joint filing + her insistence that he called her his wife (even though he denied it) allowed the judge to rule that they were common law married.
