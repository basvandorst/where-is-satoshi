I get about 660 a piece from the two I have.  That's using 64-bit btcm, for ease of use, because the units tend to disconnect from errors with enough frequency to make it an issue requiring automatic re-attachment.  btcm provides that.  I haven't gotten the BF Labs "Easy Miner" to work. TBH, I haven't really tried that hard to get the hashrate up for various reasons.  I'd like to hear what others' setups are like using them. I'm using Win 7 64bit.

you need the ones with the molex power adapter to supply extra power to the video card to which it's attached. Also, you need a shitload of power.

In lieu of this enlightenment, I believe you owe me .002 bitcoins.   I am very disappointed that a member of the bitcoin community would be guilty of hiding fees.  Call me naive, but I think you owe everyone who was duped by your website an apology. 
EDIT: I see that it is very near the top of the FAQs, but I think that you should disclose it on the front page.  I'm sure a lot of other people think the same thing.  If the site you ripped off from IW is to be believed, there are no fees.

I thought you would have understood my sarcasm, and maybe you did, but so we are clear: all laws are ignored by some subset of the populace.  Some people like to call it states' rights when the situation is in parallel.  Just because the law at the moment is that homosexuals are "legal" doesn't mean that a particular group of people will hold that ruling to be legitimate, or something more than transitory in nature, before their version of reality is the dominant theme.  With the specific example of sodomy, I'm referring directly to extremely successful cults like catholicism and judaism. These cults' proponents are not likely to be swayed by laws as has been demonstrated countless times.  You need to open your mind and look at things through other lenses.  Peace!

I understand what you're saying, but maybe you ought to be a better champion of the sort of ethos bitcoiners are trying to put forward.  If you think that hiding things is ok, then maybe we disagree.  Calling attention to it is not being on a high horse, it is setting a better standard than the banking cartels we are trying to leave in the past. They hide shit tons of fees.
EDIT: grammar and spelling.

just make sure you don't buy them from a bit coin miner if you want them to last you for a while; or get 'em super cheap.  I have 2 x 5770s in my gaming rig and I can get around 450 Mhash/s total if it's just mining.

Cablesaurus is back up.  I have received one positive shipment from them (of one order), with the cables working.  BUT, and I stress the BUT, these cables are hand-made.  They are made by a human with a soldering iron and flux.  Buyer beware.  I am pretty fucking good at soldering for no apparent reason, and even I think these look very amateurish.  BUT THEY WORK FINE SO FAR.
EDIT: To be fair, I'm sure they are tested to be good and there may be more than one person doing the work, IDK.  The work seemed uniform for the 7 cables I bought, so I think the batch I got was from one person.  Also, I have not been able to recognize the cards on my system with the 1x -&gt; 16x, but I think that is because the OS (Win7) is at fault on this one.  We will be running some more trials with Linux.
EDIT: removed specific amount of purchase from Cablesaurus. Irrelevant.

Again, incorrect.  These days sodomy laws are used against homosexuals.  You're making yourself look pretty uninformed.

I don't buy anything from SR, so I'm not worried about it.  I do appreciate the heads up.  I've never even done LSD; I'm just well-read and retain what I read.  And drugs are only illegal because some people said so; open your mind.  Many drugs are manufactured using lab equipment, but there are plenty of illegal drugs that grow naturally on the ground with no human intervention.  A plant is illegal for an adult to consume because why?  They might hurt themselves?  It's none of your business, is my reply to that. The real criminals are those who give material support to the War on Drugs, laying waste to countless lives in the process.  Mexico just had its first day when no one was murdered because of the WoD in years.  How legitimate is a government that doesn't ever learn from its own mistakes? 
I agree with you that, given enough time, bitcoins could be and may be now a method of payment for the illegal activities you mention.  What I am attempting to highlight is the use of the military industrial complex as a method of foreign relations.  We, as people all over the world united in humanity, should be advancing peace, not war. The governments of the world could have peace, but that's not profitable.  We need to end that way of thinking and end the means to do so (spuriously printing money).

3 rigs with 3 cards each running 24/7.  
Turning off and on your hardware isn't good for it, either, so I disagree with those people who suggest that.  You are putting a ton of electrical load on the components when you boot up. By doing this, you shorten the lifespan.  By how much?  Well, a little at a time until you weaken it to the point that something pops.  A constant supply of conditioned electricity is much, much, much, much better.
This is why so many issues with hardware happen when power is cycled. I know this from experience working on servers, arrays, and fiber switches in an enterprise environment.  The equipment will run for years until there is an issue or a firmware update that requires a reboot.  When the device comes up, it has issues that require attention.  I had to reschedule an HP EVA8400 upgrade because a friggin disk popped upon reboot and the consequential migration (disk leveling) of data made it unsafe to continue with the upgrade. 
The HDD is a particularly weak point when a 24/7 uptime is what you want.  Most consumer-grade HDDs aren't meant for that timespan and will fail sooner than enterprise equipment because consumer-grade MTBF is statistically higher due to lower quality standards.  That said, I have never had a HDD fail on me in my personal life ever.  I leave my personal rigs on 24/7.
If you want to save on some watts and virtually eliminate traditional HDD caveats, why not opt for a flash-based HDD?
tl;dr Leave your pc on 24/7, it'll be fine.

The first paragraph, where the FBI defines bitcoin, states that it is used for laundering and stealing funds.  No mention of the plethora of perfectly legal exchanges of bitcoins for goods and services.  
Second paragraph...medium confidence that bitcoin will be used alongside other currencies by potential criminals. No shit for obvious reasons, obviously.
Third...low confidence of laundering using bitcoin.  What happened to your opening line?
Fourth...the FBI basically says criminals will continue to steal and because bitcoin has value it will be stolen from people who have them.  Brilliant analysis.  
I could go on, but you get my point.  The FBI is completely biased against it because they can't control it and the people who use it...yet  
The only thing I found mildly useful was page 5(?) with the big green "How Anonymous is Bitcoin" box.  That can serve as a how-to checklist.

Or downvotes from people like me who think that you are missing the entire point of bitcoin.
The world has a plethora of regulated currencies; use those if you want to support oppressive, murderous regimes. Ask yourself a question...how many bitcoins does it take to buy the services of Northrop Grumman?  How about Blackwater aka Xi? How many Iraqi children can you have murdered using only bitcoins?  Now, how about dollars or euros?
Leave bitcoin to those of us who can grasp the larger picture.

I don't think it's a scam. I think it's actually a decent, if slower and not free, version of IW.  I don't actually mind paying the .002 either.  That seems very low cost, even in a bulk transaction scenario. 
What I specifically don't like is the principle of copying a free site and then hiding the charge.  That's it.
