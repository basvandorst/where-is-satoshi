How else would you define it? I realize that comparing currencies is flawed when the value of both is changing, but I'm not sure what else you can measure. Total % of all economic activity?

How long are we talking? I graduated in 2012 and for every year that I was in college the bursars office always cut me a check after the payment deadlines had passed. My best friend bought a gaming PC with his student loan money.

There are really no numerical fundamentals when it comes to crypto-currency. You can't attach a logical value to bitcoin the way you can to the cash value of a business. Sure you can point to past performance and patterns, but ultimately nobody can explain the exact reasons for why bitcoin is valued where it is, and I find it even harder to make a case for what its value will be in the future.
