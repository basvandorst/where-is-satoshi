How on earth can you try to justify this? Their service status page clearly says BTC is functioning normally. That means they're more than happy to deceive people into depositing BTC into their account which they'll have no way to retrieve later on. 
My responses were perfectly normal, if not a little upset. I don't want to paste my exact text because that would make me identifiable to someone who happens to work there who might want to retaliate against me.  
Suffice it to say I said nothing more harsh than along the lines of "What is the status of my withdrawals and why on earth are you not replying to me anymore?". That's literally the harshest thing I said.


Whatever dude, keep living your life apologizing for scam artists. It's people like you who make it possible.

I do not consider this responsive. It took the entire day and the first agent marked the case resolved before even verifying the funds had been returned.

It's not a UI issue. My money is missing. All of it. Can't trade, can't do anything.

This doesn't explain the lack of response, lack of explanation and lack of apology for having me offline for 12 hours yesterday - in a state of panic - and unable to trade during some of BTC's most significant events in the past months. 
You're holding my money. Essentially a bank. Customer support should be your number one thing. If a customer's money is missing, assuring your customer that it will be resolved is **top priority**. Not leaving them in the dark for 12 hours.

On mobile now.  Will post pics of correspondence when I get home. 
**EDIT:** Correspondence here: 
Issue has been resolved. Very unhappy with their service and lack of response. Barely even got an apology and no explanation of why all my balances suddenly vanished.
