Alright boys I’m prepared for it to go lower. I didn’t think we’d break 9k, but this bitch going to $8500 at least. I have no problem with this, because of the global instabilities/rate cutting / easing cycles coming forth to prop up these shitty economies. 
Buy the dip fellas and let’s get rich.

Stop trying to fucking day trade this shit, especially when you’re a little noob shit. Just buy on 20-40% dips, add to your portfolio and wait for the fucking moon to rise.
You’re going to get anally thrashed trying to make a extra 5% in one day.... We know where the fuck bitcoin is going pre/post halving, it’s going to the moon. Take your emotions out, stop watching price everyday and just buy and HoDL. 
Bitcoin has been hanging out at 10k for a good little while now, which is bullish (last time it stopped at 10k for a few days, and took off). 
Moral of the post, stop being a bitch and buy more on dips, stop getting psychologically/emotionally unstable over small drops.....

Average in on 30-40% dips bro, and look forward til the post halving aka this time next year. Bitcoin pulling back like this is a blessing, imagine if it went right back to 20k overnight I’d be miserable because I’d only have a few and b priced out.

@_date: 2019-07-18 01:32:39
Do you guys expect bitcoin to keep going up with no price corrections ? That would insinuate that bitcoin is a fucking bubble. Relax.... Stop being a fucking noobie. Dollar cost average into the dip, and stop crying
@_date: 2019-07-17 21:38:05
Nobody thought this shit was going to 20k without 30-40% corrections... If bitcoin went straight up like that then it would be a bubble for sure..

Let him buy 100k at the current price and average in if it goes lower. 
I’m a middle class guy, with no responsibilities, little bills and about a 98k salary. 
I own my home (30k left on mortgage, and my is car paid off). I usually say trade stock options, but I’m over it because everything is fucking overvalued. 
I dropped 40k in btc under 10k, and I’m like fuck how it turns out. No one will ever remember your name if you you continue to straddle the line like a wuss. 
My dad always told me “If you wanna get your name out, you gotta pull your thang out” (Not sure how it relates, but it was funny when he said it).

Dude stfu. Have you not ever invested in anything ? Bitcoin is having a healthy pullback... and now all of a sudden it’s in recession territory? You kids are fucking jokes seriously. 
If bitcoin went straight the fuck up non stop to 20k then you should be scared... It’s having healthy pullbacks. If you sell before the halving of 2020 you’re a fucking retard.
@_date: 2019-07-29 00:54:27
Dude I would buy like 30 if it went to 2k
@_date: 2019-07-24 18:11:56

You may as well trade stock options.. trying to do this with BtC is way more risky, and will not yield large gains. Don’t be a jack ass

@_date: 2019-08-30 11:43:52
Fomo of halving and the current status of the current financial situation will get us there easily. You don’t think we’ll have a recession in the next 2 years? The whole world is on a thin line... hard Brexit, negative yielding debt, the longest business cycle ever in the US, geopolitical and trade wars with the two biggest economies, so many reasons why.

If bitcoin crashand burns which I highly doubt, lll be ok, I have  7 coins and I have a great financial situation.  You can either be a bad ass like me and take chances/fail if you have to or you can be a pussy, sit on cash, watch Dave Ramsey videos, and live with regrets.

The economic data in the US is contracting hard! Manufacturing came in yesterday @ 47 for September from 49 in August putting the manufacturing sector in recessionary territory. (47 is the lowest manufacturing number since 2009). 
Today the ADP non farm employment report came in below expectations with 135k jobs, and the stock market is getting wrecked. Hopefully a sell off continues as more shitty data comes out throughout October. Next week we get the PPI and CPI, which shows us where inflation stands.

If bitcoin pushes up toward $8300-8500, I don’t think we get the 6k that most of you guys have been praying for/predicting...Too much global uncertainty right now... The fed is probably going to announce more rate cuts on Oct 27th, Brexit not happening, And the whole entire global economy is leaning towards recessionary territory. 
Smart money has to to go somewhere soon, and a already up 20% YTD S&amp;P 500 is not where it’s going to go (especially with declining economic data, and a trade war that’s making minimal progress), Nor is it going to go into bonds yielding negative interests.

Not to mention the NBA GM showing support for Hong Kong, and the NBA commissioner supporting the  “Free Speech”, for the GM.....Shortly afterwards China cut NBA from its networks causing the NBA to lose billions. If big corporations get involved in this governmental trade war this thing gets really ugly over the next few weeks.

Apparently because white ppl have created a privilege that has allowed them to capitalize on everything in society here in America. Because white ppl have rigged the system, and done some of the most fucked up shit the world has ever seen... We talk about Hitler and what he has done, but I think White Americans have done just as much if we look back historically.

Stocks will not perform nearly as well as how they’ve performed the past 10yrs. 
The fed kept rates at 0%, and did 3 rounds of QE which sent a fuck ton of capital into stocks.... 
If you can buy In strategically at a discount once a massive company like apple/amazon/Microsoft corrects then id definitely sell some crypto to get loaded to the tits, but bitcoin is my long play it will outperform stocks like it has over the last 10yrs

This nigga Akon, is trying to revolutionize the African continent by helping convert them to crypto. He’s sitting down with African presidents trying to figure out how to break away from the neo colonization of the French  who holds  50% of the treasuries to African wealth.
France is a shit country, they would be a 3rd world country if they weren’t extracting Africa’s wealth.

Basically the European Central Bank will be printing a bunch of money (20 bill a month), to buy EU bonds to help stimulate their cratering economy. 
In the long run this is bad, because inflation will soon start to rise and the Eu won’t be worth the paper used to wipe your ass with.
@_date: 2019-09-09 17:19:02
Could be. Dude bitcoin could be 16k in 3 days, the shit doesn’t take a long time.

I got some advice, collect as much BTC as possible, get the Lambo and the women will come.

How much is Arthur Hayes worth?
@_date: 2019-09-04 19:59:16
I think way sooner, based on the current global macroeconomic situation. Things are not going to get better. Negative rates, crumbling EU, a trade war that’s getting even more spicy, and more crypto adoption globally...The stage is being set up perfectly for Bitcoin to move in like bruh man from the 5th floor, trying to get a sammich.
@_date: 2019-09-06 20:31:18
Yeah but when the govt is suppressing rates artificially keeping them low so that cash can and will flow into stocks that’s some serious manipulation. Check stocks for the past 11yrs, they’ve gone straight up,  while gold has been stagnating after a minor jump.
@_date: 2019-09-06 18:12:30
